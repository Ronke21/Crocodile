<text>The Merck Group, branded and commonly known as Merck, is a German multinational science and technology company headquartered in Darmstadt, with about 60,000 employees and a presence in 66 countries. The group includes around 250 companies; the main company is Merck KGaA in Germany. The company is divided into three business lines: Healthcare, Life Sciences and Electronics. Merck was founded in 1668 and is the world&#x27;s oldest operating chemical and pharmaceutical company, as well as one of the largest pharmaceutical companies globally.

Merck operates in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. It has major research and development centres in Darmstadt, Boston, Tokyo and Beijing, as well as other Research and Development units in Taiwan, France, Israel, South Korea, India, and the UK. Merck pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine in the 19th century and for a time held a virtual monopoly on cocaine.

Merck was privately owned until going public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1995 and is listed on the DAX index of Germany&#x27;s top companies. The Merck family still controls a majority of 70.3% of the company&#x27;s shares. The Merck Group includes around 250 companies in 180 countries; the current main parent company of the group, since 1995, is named &quot;Merck KGaA&quot;, and is itself mainly owned by the former main parent company, &quot;E. Merck oHG&quot;, which now operates as a holding company.

The American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co. was established as a subsidiary of Merck in 1891, but was nationalized by the United States in 1917, before being privatized again when George W. Merck, a member of an American branch of the Merck family, repurchased the stock in 1919. It is known as MSD (&quot;Merck Sharp and Dohme&quot;) outside of North America. The original Merck of Darmstadt holds the rights to the name Merck in all countries except the U.S. and Canada, where it is known as EMD (&quot;Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt&quot;), and the life science business specifically is known as MilliporeSigma. In 2015 Merck adopted a uniform brand identity for all its subsidiaries, and the company has stressed its intention to protect the brand of &quot;the real Merck&quot; globally and initiated litigation against its former subsidiary over use of the name.

In 2018, the company celebrated their 350th anniversary. Merck has formed a strategic alliance with the Technische Universität Darmstadt, which is located in the same town as Merck.

== History ==
===Origins and confiscation===

The roots of Merck reach back as far as the 17th century in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt (now a part of Germany). In 1668, Friedrich Jacob Merck, an apothecary, assumed ownership of the &quot;Engel-Apotheke&quot; () in Darmstadt.

In 1816, Emanuel Merck, a descendant of the original founder, took over the pharmacy. Thanks to his scientific education he was successful in isolating and characterizing several different alkaloids in the pharmacy&#x27;s laboratory, and by doing so also invented a number of drugs. He began the manufacture of these substances &quot;in bulk&quot; in 1827, touting them as a &quot;Cabinet of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Innovations&quot;. He and his successors gradually built up a chemical-pharmaceutical factory that produced — in addition to raw materials for pharmaceutical preparations — a multitude of other chemicals and (from 1890) medicines.

In 1891, Georg(e) Merck established himself in the United States and set up &quot;Merck &amp; Co.&quot; with Theodore Weicker in New York. Merck &amp; Co. was confiscated following the First World War and set up as an independent company in the United States. Today, the US company, which operates as Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) outside the U.S. and Canada, has about 68,000 employees (December 2021) in 120 countries. It is one of the top 5 pharmaceutical companies worldwide, larger than its German ancestor, which employs 60,334 people in 67 countries (December 2021). While Merck in Darmstadt is the legal successor of the original Merck and retains the rights to the name &quot;Merck&quot; in all countries except the U.S. and Canada, it is sometimes known as the &quot;German Merck&quot; or &quot;Merck Darmstadt&quot; in North America. The company was formerly also referred to as &quot;E. Merck&quot; (Emanuel Merck).

===20th century activities===
====Nazi years====
In the years of the Nazi rule, the company was led by Karl Emanuel Merck who became a member of the Nazi Party in 1933 and subsequently received the title of Wehrwirtschaftsführer. In addition, Merck was president of the Hessian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as performing an advisory function in the Expert Advisory Council for National Health (&quot;Sachverständigenrat für Volksgesundheit&quot;) of the Nazi Party. During World War II, Merck was manufacturing war essential products such as narcotics, vitamins, biocides and other chemicals. According to the company&#x27;s account, 265 forced laborers were working in the plant in Darmstadt, most of them women from Russia and Poland. Additionally, several hundred Fremdarbeiter (&quot;foreign workers&quot;) from France and Belgium were employed throughout the war years. An air raid on 12 December 1944 destroyed nearly 70 percent of the plant and killed 55 employees.

====Post-war====
In 1973, Merck Ltd. acquired BDH Chemicals from the Glaxo Group.

In the early 1980s Merck Group built a visitor center at its Darmstadt headquarters that featured a pyramid.

Merck was legally named &quot;E. Merck oHG&quot; until 1995. In 1995 it was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and became a KGaA, legally named &quot;Merck KGaA&quot;.

===2000 to 2009===
On 13 March 2006, Merck announced a takeover bid for Schering AG, the world&#x27;s largest producer of oral contraceptives. On 23 March 2006, Bayer AG made a supported offer for Schering and Merck decided to drop out of the bidding for the company. Schering is not to be confused with Schering-Plough which was once part of Schering AG but was acquired by Merck &amp; Co. in 2009. In September 2006 the company announced a takeover bid of $13.2 billion for Serono SA, Switzerland&#x27;s largest biotech firm. The deal included a buy-out of the Bertarelli family&#x27;s 64.5% stake in Serono to be followed by a public tender offer for the remaining shares starting in November 2006. The combined company has an R&amp;D budget of approximately $1.1 billion and sales of approximately $4.6 billion. Its approximately $2 billion in sales of biologics would make it seventh among pharmaceutical/biotech companies. The new entity, Merck Serono, began operations in 2007.

Merck KGaA established its philanthropic foundation in 2008 called Merck Foundation. Rasha Kelej currently serves as its CEO.

=== 2010 onwards ===

In 2010, Merck took over Billerica (MA) based Millipore Corporation for EUR 5.3 billion (US$7.2 billion). It is now Merck&#x27;s life science business unit. With the acquisition of Millipore, Merck is consolidating its US holdings and shutting down the Gibbstown facility and warehouse. Gibbstown operations will be transferred to the new Philadelphia office and Millipore headquarters.

Merck Korea received the &quot;Leading Investor Award&quot; at the 5th Korea-EU Industrial Cooperation Day in 2011.

In December 2013, the company bought AZ Electronic Materials SA (AZEM) for about $2.6 billion in cash to increase its offering of specialty chemicals to the electronics industry.

In September 2014 Merck halted the clinical development of two drug candidates in development with Oxygen Biotherapeutics. One drug candidate suffered a lack of success in patient recruitment, with its MUC1 antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy drug, tecemotide (L-BLP25), missing its Phase I/II endpoint of increasing overall survival in patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Later in September it was announced that the company would acquire Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion. After the acquisition was completed in 2015, Merck had around 50,000 employees. In November 2014, Merck and Pfizer agreed a deal for the latter to sell the former sharing rights to develop an experimental immunotherapy drug for a fee of $850 million.

In October 2015, Merck revealed it would return the rights of the Kuvan drug to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. The drug is effective in the treatment of the rare genetic disorder PKU, however Merck is moving away from genetics into cancer treatment, immunology and neurology. In October, it was announced that Karl-Ludwig Kley, CEO of Merck since April 2007, would retire in April 2016, and be succeeded by Stefan Oschmann, who has been a member of the executive board since 2011. The company started building new facilities for its R&amp;D operations and a new visitor center at its Darmstadt site in the early 2010s. By 2015 the site&#x27;s pyramid had been torn down as part of the renovations.
In April 2017, the company announced it had completed the acquisition of food safety testing company, BioControl Systems Inc. In August of the same year the company announced the acquisition of Natrix Separations for an undisclosed sum.

In April 2019, Merck announced it would acquire Versum Materials. The acquisition was completed in October 2019 and represented an equity value of about U$5.8 billion. In the same year, Merck has also announced the acquisition of Intermolecular Inc, the California-based company for advanced materials. The acquisition was completed in September 2019 and represented an equity value of U$62 million.

In February 2020, Merck announced the divestment of its Allergopharma Business to Dermapharm, under an unspecified fee. The deal includes Merck&#x27;s Portfolio in Europe and parts of Asia, including China and India.

In January 2021, MilliporeSigma announced it would acquire AmpTec to expand and enhance the businesses mRNA vaccine capabilities as well as its treatment and diagnostics offerings. In March, its Performance Materials division changed name to Electronics division. In December of the same year, EMD Serono (Merck Group operations in the US and Canada) announced it would acquire Swiss-based Chord Therapeutics and its lead drug cladribine, used in generalised myasthenia gravis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.

====Merck consumer-health====
In September 2017, Merck said it is considering options for its consumer-health division, including a potential full or partial sale, or strategic partnership. An equity analyst estimated the unit could command a purchase price of €1.8 billion to €2.7 billion from a full sale. In December &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that both Nestlé and private equity owners of Stada were preparing bids for Merck&#x27;s consumer health group. Days later, Reuters again reported that Perrigo was also preparing a bid for the division in the region of €4 billion ($4.7 billion to $4.8 billion). In April 2018, Reuters reported that generic drug manufacturer, Mylan was in advanced discussions to acquire the consumer health business for between €3.5–4 billion (£3–3.4 billion). Later in the month, Reuters reported that Procter &amp; Gamble would purchase the division for €3.4 billion euros (£2.96 billion; $4.2 billion).

===Name===
Merck in Darmstadt is the sole legal successor of the original Merck and retains the rights to the trademark &quot;Merck&quot; in all countries except the U.S. and Canada, where &quot;EMD&quot; brand is mostly used (it was introduced alongside Merck&#x27;s 2001 logo). In recent branding campaigns, the company has referred to itself as &quot;the original Merck&quot; and &quot;the real Merck&quot;. The company was legally known as &quot;E. Merck oHG&quot; until 1995, when &quot;Merck KGaA&quot; became the main parent company and the former a holding company. Both oHG and KGaA are generic business entity type designations and not used in everyday speech or branding.

In 2015 Merck adopted a new logo to increase the visual differences between both companies, while also visualizing &quot;vibrant science and technology&quot; as the new company&#x27;s brand. It has initiated litigation in several countries against its former subsidiary Merck &amp; Co. (MSD) over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom; the judge also held that MSD&#x27;s use of &quot;Merck&quot; as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck&#x27;s trade mark rights in the UK. In response, MSD has initiated counter-litigation in the United States.

After those controversies, Merck also adopted a new logo for EMD. The same look was also given to the logos of EMD Serono, MilliporeSigma, and EMD Performance Materials (renamed EMD Electronics in March 2021) divisions. Its corporate website is &quot;merckgroup.com&quot; in the world excluding U.S. and Canada, displaying normal Merck logo in the header, and &quot;emdgroup.com&quot; in U.S. and Canada, displaying use of its corporate name, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in the header and additionally displaying a disclaimer about trademark ownership in the footer.

On 7 December 2021, Merck, which uses the name EMD Electronics in North America, announced they would be investing $1 billion in a U.S. operations joint venture with Palantir Technologies to assist in solving some of the chip industries supply chain problems. The plan is for sites in Pennsylvania, Texas, California, and Arizona.

=== Price fixing settlement ===
Generics UK (Merck&#x27;s former British subsidiary, the global Generics business being sold on 2 October 2007) paid a £12M out-of-court settlement with the Department of Health and Social Care of the UK over involvement in an alleged price and supply fixing cartel.

The NHS alleges various drugs companies exploited the oligopolistic market conditions, forcing the NHS to pay inflated prices. NHS fraud investigators believe there was a conspiracy to limit the supply of 30 of its most commonly prescribed drugs, including a class of penicillin antibiotics and to a generic version of best-selling ulcer treatment Zantac. The NHS has so far filed claims in relation to just three drugs, seeking damages of more than £150m, while the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is conducting a parallel investigation into the price-fixing allegations limited to the supply of blood-thinning pill warfarin and penicillin-based antibiotics. Homes and offices of executives at six firms, including Ranbaxy, Generics UK, Norton Healthcare, Goldshield and Regent-GM were raided by the SFO in May 2002.

== Controversies ==
Merck KGaA has faced criticism for continuing its business operations in Russia following the country&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Despite international sanctions and pressure on companies to exit the Russian market, Merck KGaA has maintained its presence, citing commitments to supplying essential medicines. This decision has sparked backlash from activists and organizations advocating for corporate responsibility in geopolitical conflicts.

== Healthcare ==
After Wilhelm Adam Sertürner&#x27;s isolation of morphine from opium in 1805, Merck pioneered (from 1827) the commercial manufacture of morphine for an expanding global market. From 1884 onwards, Merck also played role in the production and marketing of cocaine. Sigmund Freud, author of &quot;Über Coca&quot; (1884), was an enthusiastic collaborator in Merck&#x27;s cocaine research, though the methodological sophistication of his self-experimentation studies has been challenged.
Attention was directed at vitamins as a new product category, and Vigantol was introduced in 1927, followed by Cebion in 1934.

Following the defeat of Germany in World War II, Merck was granted permission by the military government to produce drugs, pesticides, food preservatives, reagents, and fine chemicals for laboratory use. Soon afterward the boom that is commonly known as the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot; (economic miracle) set in. For Merck, this meant two-digit sales-growth figures for many years. Products of this time included corticoid preparations — for example Fortecortin, which is still used today — the cold remedy Nasivin or the hormone preparations Gestafortin and Mantova.

Merck currently employs over 2,500 people in its 4 R&amp;D hubs via. Boston, Darmstadt, Beijing and Tokyo. In the year 2018, Merck invested over €1,6 billion in its R&amp;D operations.
The focus of Merck&#x27;s current pharmaceutical R&amp;D is on oncology, neurology and immunology. In oncology, its first marketed product is &quot;Erbitux&quot; (cetuximab), for which it has marketing rights worldwide, apart from North America. (Cetuximab was discovered by Imclone Systems, and is marketed in North America by Bristol-Myers Squibb.) Other areas of Expertise from Merck Healthcare include Fertility, Endocrinology and General Medicine, the later focusing on treatments for Diabetes, Thyroid disease and Cardiovascular diseases. Some products from Merck include Metformin, Bisoprolol, Levothyroxine and Digitoxin. Merck&#x27;s clinical research strategy consists of a partnership with Quintiles in which the latter helps the former in the clinical development of all its compounds. In February 2019, Merck also announced a partnership with GSK to develop and commercialize M7824 (bintrafusp alfa*), a new Immunotherapy with potential in various difficult-to-treat cancers. In 2020, Merck launched partnership with Pechoin in China to develop &quot;high-tech herbal&quot; skincare products.

== Life science ==
The life science business of Merck, formerly known as Merck Millipore, was created in July 2010 following the completed acquisition of the US company Millipore. It employs around 19,000 people in 66 countries and runs 65 manufacturing sites and uses the brands Sigma-Aldrich, Milli-Q and Millipore. This division comprises all Millipore activities and major segments of the former Merck division Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals.Merck Millipore had three business units: Bioscience, Lab Solutions and Process Solutions. The Bioscience business unit is dedicated to solutions and reagents for protein research and cell biology, cell culture solutions, as well as to products and services for the development of biopharmaceutical agents. The scope of activities of Lab Solutions included laboratory chemicals and other materials for research, science and industry, products and services for sampling, and test kits for the pharmaceutical, foods and diagnostics industries, along with products, consumables and services surrounding highly purified laboratory water for science and industry. Process Solutions focused on products and services for the production of chemical and biopharmaceutical agents. In 2022 the business was restructured and consisted afterwards of the entities Life Science Services, Science &amp; Lab Solutions, and Process Solutions. The Life Science Services include the Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) and contract testing services. Science &amp; Lab Solutions includes products for Laboratories and Quality Control organizations. Process Solutions supports the biopharma manufacturing processes of its clients with single-use products.

In 2015, Merck acquired SigmaAldrich and combined it with Merck Millipore. The company was branded Merck globally and MilliporeSigma in the United States and Canada The newly established life science business of Merck has 300,000 products and three business units: Research Solutions, Process Solutions and Applied Solutions. The company serves customers in biotech, pharma, diagnostics, food safety, academia, and environmental. Matthias Heinzel serves as the CEO of the life science business of Merck.

The Life Science business sponsors several award programs for graduate students. One of these awards, the Alfred R. Bader Award for Student Innovation recognizes advanced chemistry graduate students, typically in the field of synthetic organic chemistry.

==Electronics==

===Semiconductors===

Semiconductor Solutions is the largest business unit within Merck&#x27;s Electronics business sector. It provides materials, delivery systems, and services for the semiconductor industry. The business unit supplies products for every major production step in the wafer processing, including doping, lithography, patterning, deposition, planarization, etching, and cleaning. After the acquisition of Intermolecular, its capabilities allow material combinations to be tested directly in the specific application environment accelerating learning cycles. Since the acquisition of Versum and Intermolecular, inc., the company&#x27;s portfolio in electronic materials was significantly expanded. The launch of the integrated organization was done on 1 June 2020.

===Pigments and cosmetics===
Merck started working on effect pigments in 1957. The business unit is called Surface Solutions. The core markets for Surface Solutions are automotive coatings, cosmetics, and, to a smaller extent, industrials. An example of its pigments is alumina effect pigments sold under the brand name Xirallic. Currently, this business unit pools all activities for pigments in lacquering, printing, and plastic applications, in the field of security technology (for instance counterfeiting protection), pigments for applications in the food and pharmaceutical areas, functional materials, and active substances and pigments for cosmetics.

==M Ventures==
&quot;M Ventures&quot; is a venture capital fund of Merck. In 2021, the funds available for investment were increased by Eur 600M to enable investments Biotechnology and Technology.

== Emanuel Merck Lectureship award ==

The award was jointly established by Merck and the Technische Universität Darmstadt in 1992. It recognizes scientists who have made contributions to chemical and pharmaceutical research.

== Future Insight Prize ==
During the company&#x27;s 350th anniversary in 2018, Merck announced the Future Insight Prize The prize consists of a research grant of €1,000,000 ($1.1 million) every year through the next 35 years, to motivate innovation in areas that could solve humanity&#x27;s most pressing issues.

<text>Edward Adrian Wilson (23 July 1872 – 29 March 1912) was an English polar explorer, ornithologist, natural historian, physician and artist.

== Early life ==
Born in Cheltenham on 23 July 1872, Wilson was the second son and fifth child of physician Edward Thomas Wilson and his wife, Mary Agnes, née Whishaw. A clever, sensitive, but boisterous boy, he developed a love of the countryside, natural history and drawing from an early age. He was sent as a boarder to a preparatory school in Clifton, Bristol, but after failing to gain a scholarship to public school, he attended Cheltenham College for boys as a day pupil. 

His mother was a poultry breeder and he spent much of his youth at The Crippetts farm, Shurdington near Cheltenham. By the age of nine, he had announced to his parents that he was going to become a naturalist. With encouragement and tuition from his father, he started to draw pictures of the wildlife and fauna in the fields around the farm. The Worst Journey in the World explains that &quot;as a boy his father sent him away on rambling holidays, the only condition being that he should return with a certain number of drawings.&quot; After passing his exams with honours in science in 1891, he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences, obtaining a first-class degree in 1894.

It was during his time there that he developed the deep Christian faith and asceticism by which he lived his life. He studied for his Bachelor of Medicine degree at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, London and undertook mission work in the slums of Battersea in his spare time. In February 1898, shortly before qualifying as a doctor, Wilson became seriously ill and was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, contracted during his mission work.

During a long convalescence from this illness he spent months in Norway and Switzerland, time he used to practise and develop his skills as an artist. He qualified in medicine in 1900, and the next year was appointed junior house surgeon at Cheltenham General Hospital.

In 1897, he met Oriana Fanny Souper at Caius House, Battersea, while he was conducting mission work. They married on 16 July 1901, three weeks before setting off for the Antarctic as a member of Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s expedition. The wedding was in Hilton, Huntingdonshire, where her father was vicar.

== Antarctica ==

=== &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition ===
From 1901 to 1904, Wilson acted as junior surgeon, zoologist and expedition artist, setting off on the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition on 6 August 1901. They reached Antarctica in January 1902. On 2 November, Wilson, Scott and Ernest Shackleton set off on a journey that, at the time, was the southernmost trek achieved by any explorer. The party had dogs but they were not experienced in using them and the food brought for the dogs had gone bad. With many of the dogs dead, they turned back on 31 December, having reached latitude 82° 17&#x27;S. They had travelled farther south than anyone before them and were only from the Pole.

Shackleton was deteriorating rapidly, coughing blood and suffering fainting spells and unable to help pull the sledge. Scott and Wilson, themselves suffering, struggled to get the party home. It was a close call. However, 93 days after setting off, having covered , they reached the &quot;Discovery&quot; and safety in February 1903. The following month, Shackleton, having suffered particularly badly from scurvy and exhaustion, was sent home early by Scott on the relief ship &quot;Morning&quot;. 

Cherry-Garrard writes: 

 Wilson was not a particularly strong man. On leaving with the Discovery he was but lately cured of consumption, yet he went with Scott to his farthest South, and helped to get Shackleton back alive. Shackleton owed his life to those two. Wilson was of a slimmer, more athletic build, a great walker, 5 feet 10½ inches in height, 11 stones in weight, with a chest measurement of 36 inches. He was an ideal example of my contention, which I believe can be proved many times over to be a fact, that it is not strength of body but rather strength of will which carries a man farthest where mind and body are taxed at the same time to their utmost limit. 

On his return, Shackleton asked Wilson to join his &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition to Antarctica in 1907, but partly out of loyalty to Scott, Wilson declined.

=== &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition ===
On 15 June 1910, Wilson set sail from Cardiff on the , as chief of the scientific staff of Scott&#x27;s final journey, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; Expedition. After making stops in Madeira, South Trinidad, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; was trapped for three weeks by pack ice, and finally arrived at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound in early January 1911. A base camp hut was built and three weeks later work began to establish the supply depots in preparation for the journey to the South Pole the following austral spring. Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies meant that the main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid further north of its planned location at 80°S, something that was to prove critical during the return journey from the Pole the following year.

In addition to the drawings of land, pack, icebergs and Barrier, the primary object of which was scientific and geographical, Wilson has left a number of paintings of atmospheric phenomena which are not only scientifically accurate but are also exceedingly beautiful. Of such are the records of auroral displays, parhelions, paraselene, lunar halos, fog bows, irridescent (sic) clouds, refracted images of mountains and mirage generally. If you look at a picture of a parhelion by Wilson not only can you be sure that the mock suns, circles and shafts appeared in the sky as they are shown on paper, but you can also rest assured that the number of degrees between, say, the sun and the outer ring of light were in fact such as he has represented them. You can also be certain in looking at his pictures that if cirrus cloud is shown, then cirrus and not stratus cloud was in the sky: if it is not shown, then the sky was clear. It is accuracy such as this which gives an exceptional value to work viewed from a scientific standpoint. Mention should also be made of the paintings and drawings made constantly by Wilson for the various specialists on the expedition whenever they wished for colour records of their specimens; in this connection the paintings of fish and various parasites are especially valuable.

I am not specially qualified to judge Wilson from the artistic point of view. But if you want accuracy of drawing, truth of colour, and a reproduction of the soft and delicate atmospheric effects which obtain in this part of the world, then you have them here. Whatever may be said of the painting as such, it is undeniable that an artist of this type is of inestimable value to an expedition which is doing scientific and geographical work in a little-known part of the earth.

Wilson himself set a low value on his artistic capacity. We used to discuss what Turner would have produced in a land which offered colour effects of such beauty. If we urged him to try and paint some peculiar effect and he felt that to do so was beyond his powers he made no scruple of saying so. His colour is clear, his brush-work clean: and he handled sledging subjects with the vigour of a professional who knew all there was to be known about a sledging life.

—Excerpt from The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard


In the austral winter of 1911, Wilson led the &quot;winter journey&quot;, a journey with Henry Robertson Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard, to the emperor penguin breeding grounds at Cape Crozier to collect eggs for scientific study. The journey was made in almost total darkness, with temperatures reaching as low as . At this time, while making a blubber stove, he was hit in the eye with boiling oil. Wilson only mentioned to Scott later, &quot;I was incapacitated for a short time.&quot; 

Frozen and exhausted, they reached their goal only to be stopped by a blizzard, during which their tent was ripped away and carried off by the wind, leaving the men trapped in their sleeping bags for a day and a half under a thickening drift of snow. Bowers sang to pass the time, and the other two joined in when they could hear him over the wind, occasionally kicking each other through their bags to indicate they were alive. When the winds subsided, by great fortune they found their tent lodged about half a mile away in rocks. Having successfully collected three eggs, and desperately exhausted, they returned to Cape Evans on 1 August 1911, five weeks after setting off. Cherry-Garrard later described this expedition in his memoir, &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;.

On 1 November, 14 men set off from Cape Evans on the long trip to the South Pole. Seventy-nine days later, Wilson was one of the five-man Polar party that reached the Pole on 18 January 1912, only to find the pole had been claimed by Norwegian Roald Amundsen and his team just five weeks earlier.

Their return journey soon became a desperate affair due to the combination of exhaustion, lack of nutrients in their diet and exceptionally adverse weather. On 17 February, near the base of the Beardmore Glacier, petty officer Edgar Evans died, suspected to be from a brain injury sustained after a fall into a crevasse two weeks earlier. Then, in a vain attempt to save his companions, Captain Lawrence Oates deliberately walked out of their tent to his death on 16 March after his frostbitten feet developed gangrene. Wilson, Scott and Bowers continued on for three more days, progressing an extra , but were stopped by a blizzard on 20 March, short of the &#x27;One Ton&#x27; food depot that could have saved them.
The blizzard continued for days, longer than they had fuel and food for. Too weak, cold and hungry to continue, they died in their tent on or soon after 29 March—Scott&#x27;s last diary entry—still from their base camp. Their bodies were found by a search party the following spring on 12 November 1912. Their tent was collapsed over them by the search party who then buried them where they lay, under a snow cairn, topped by a cross made from a pair of skis. When news of the tragedy reached Britain in February 1913, it was mourned nationally.

Affectionately nicknamed &quot;Uncle Bill&quot; by the men of the expedition, Wilson was the confidant of many, respected for his judgement, skills at mediation and dedication to others. By all accounts, Wilson was probably Scott&#x27;s closest comrade of the expedition. Scott wrote, &quot;Words must always fail me when I talk of Bill Wilson. I believe he really is the finest character I ever met.&quot; When Scott&#x27;s final camp was discovered by a search team in November 1912, Bowers and Wilson were found frozen in their sleeping bags. Scott&#x27;s bag was open and his body partially out of his bag – his left arm was extended across Wilson.

== Legacy ==

In 1913 Wilson was posthumously awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal by the Royal Geographical Society for his work in the Antarctic. At Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the college flag, which Wilson took to the South Pole, is preserved.
Wilson&#x27;s artwork and objects relating to him appear in several museum collections. The largest collection of his artwork is held at the Scott Polar Research Institute, part of the University of Cambridge, which cares for over 200 watercolours of British birds by Wilson, as well as a further 150 paintings made in Antarctica. His watercolours were done quickly by necessity, as the paper would freeze as he worked, and were remembered by members of the Terra Nova expedition as faithful depictions of their journey. His admiration of John Ruskin influenced his work. The institute&#x27;s Polar Museum displays a range of objects associated with Wilson, including:

* A sledging flag his wife sewed for him, was, after his death, first displayed in Gloucester Cathedral, is now in the collection of the Scott Polar Research Institute.
* A black flag from the Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition found near the South Pole and brought back by Wilson on the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910–1913.
* A Royal Geographical Society Patron&#x27;s Medal (George V issue), in a dark blue case, awarded posthumously to Wilson and presented to Mrs Wilson in 1913.
* A candlestick made by Wilson out of a Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuit tin during the British Antarctic Expedition.

The journal kept by Wilson during the South Polar journey on the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition is held in the British Library, along with Captain Scott&#x27;s diary from the expedition. The Wilson art gallery and museum in Cheltenham, holds a collection of watercolours and drawings made by Wilson, as well as the family papers of his father, Edward Thomas Wilson, who was instrumental in founding the Camera Club, museum, library, a fever hospital, district nursing organisation, and clean water provision for the town.

The in Dundee, the ship Wilson first travelled to Antarctica on, is preserved as a heritage site, and accessible to visitors. The Dundee Heritage Trust collection also includes a small collection of material including a scrapbook and photographs from the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition.

The statue of Wilson on the Promenade in Cheltenham, modelled by Scott&#x27;s widow Kathleen Scott, was unveiled on 9 July 1914 by Arctic explorer Sir Clements Markham. In September 2013 the Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum was renamed &#x27;The Wilson&#x27; in his honour. There is a large block of flats named after him in Hesters Way, Cheltenham. One of the houses at Cheltenham College is named Westal, after Wilson&#x27;s family home on Montpellier Parade, Cheltenham.

There is a blue plaque on the former Caius House in Battersea. The Edward Wilson Primary School in Paddington, London is named after him. The students&#x27; café at St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School is named Eddie Wilson&#x27;s.

In the 1948 film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, Wilson was played by Harold Warrender. In the 1985 Central TV serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, Wilson was played by Stephen Moore. In the 2007 BBC Four production &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;, Wilson was played by John Arthur.

<text>Comfort Eagle is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band Cake. It was released on July 24, 2001, on Columbia Records, their first with the company.

==Release==
In its opening week, &quot;Comfort Eagle&quot; sold about 72,000 copies, debuting at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By 2002, the album had sold 408,000 copies. On February 2, 2003, it was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of half a million copies.

The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;Short Skirt/Long Jacket.&quot; The band asked fans to vote for the album&#x27;s second single via their website, with the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Comfort Eagle&quot; being the eventual winner, however this single release was cancelled after the September 11 attacks. The band wrote: &quot;Due to unforeseen changes in national media, CAKE must now change its upcoming single from &#x27;Comfort Eagle&#x27; to &#x27;Love You Madly.&#x27; We apologize to those of you who voted for the latter, but due to its airplane, corporate, and Middle Eastern references, &#x27;Comfort Eagle&#x27; has been deemed inappropriate for today&#x27;s emotional climate.&quot;

<text>Sevmorput (, Northeast Passage) is a Russian nuclear-powered cargo ship. The 1988-built vessel is one of only four nuclear-powered merchant ships ever built and, after returning to service in 2016 following an extensive refit, the only such vessel to remain in service . 

==History==

===Development and construction===

After the Second World War, the Soviet Union began developing the Northern Sea Route in order to support the economic exploitation of the vast natural resources of the northern regions. The ambitious plan initiated by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1950s led to the construction of powerful icebreakers to escort cargo ships through the ice-covered waters and extend the navigating season in the Russian Arctic. The flagship of the post-war Soviet icebreaker fleet was the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered icebreaker, &quot;Lenin&quot;.

While numerous warships and submarines were built with nuclear marine propulsion, attempts to utilize the nearly unlimited range provided by an onboard nuclear reactor to transport commercial cargo were limited to a small number of experimental prototypes. The United States had built the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered merchant ship, &quot;Savannah&quot;, primarily as a technological demonstrator and ambassador for the peaceful use of atomic power rather than an economically viable cargo ship. Similarly, both the West German &quot;Otto Hahn&quot; and the Japanese &quot;Mutsu&quot; were intended to be research ships and to provide experience from nuclear propulsion; the latter also never carried any commercial cargo.

However, the Soviet Union continued developing nuclear-powered ships to support Arctic shipping and began building new nuclear-powered icebreakers in the 1970s. On 30 May 1978, the Ministry of the Merchant Marine (MORFLOT) and the Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry of the Soviet Union signed a joint decision No. C-13/01360 for the development of an ice-strengthened nuclear-powered lighter aboard ship (LASH) carrier. The design work was assigned to the Leningrad-based Central Design Bureau &quot;Baltsudoproekt&quot;.

The keel of &quot;Project 10081&quot; was laid at Zaliv Shipyard in Kerch, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, on 1 June 1982 and the ship was launched on 20 February 1986. The nuclear-powered LASH carrier was named &quot;Sevmorput&quot; () after the Russian abbreviation for the Northern Sea Route (). The ship&#x27;s KLT-40 reactor plant reached criticality on 26 October 1986. &quot;Sevmorput&quot; was delivered to the state-owned Murmansk Shipping Company (MSCO) on 31 December 1988.

The overall price of the nuclear-powered cargo ship was reported to be around US$265 million.

===Career===

==== Murmansk Shipping Company (1988–2008) ====

After leaving the shipyard and entering commercial service, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; sailed through the Mediterranean and around Africa until finally reaching the Soviet Far East. However, authorities in Nakhodka, Vostochny, Magadan and Vladivostok refused to accept the two-month-old ship into their ports due to popular protests. In addition the harbour workers also refused to load or unload any cargo or provide any port services due to fears of radiation leakage. This was caused by uncertainty about the safety of the ship&#x27;s nuclear propulsion system and the shadow of the Chernobyl disaster only a few years earlier. The local newspapers had also reported a four-minute emergency on board the nuclear icebreaker &quot;Rossiya&quot; only a week before the arrival of &quot;Sevmorput&quot;. The ship was finally allowed to dock at Vladivostok on 13 March 1989.

The initial plan was to utilize &quot;Sevmorput&quot; in international transport, and the Soviet government applied for a permission to have the ship make several stops in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in March 1990. However, the permission was denied because the evacuation and emergency response measures of the city were not deemed adequate in case of an accident involving the ship&#x27;s nuclear reactor. Later the ship was mainly used on the Murmansk-Dudinka route, but also made several trips to Vietnam in the early 1990s. The daily operating expenses of &quot;Sevmorput&quot; were reportedly around US$90,000 and she was not expected to make profit during the first two years of her career.

In the late 1990s, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; was laid up in Murmansk due to delays in the refueling of her reactor. The refueling finally took place in 2001 and later the ship resumed service on the Dudinka route.

In August 2007, it was reported that &quot;Sevmorput&quot; would be converted into the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered drillship due to lack of demand for cargo operators for lighters and the need of specialized drilling vessels in the Russian Arctic. The conversion at the Zvezdochka plant in Severodvinsk was to take only 18 months. However, the renovation project was cancelled in February 2008.

==== Atomflot (2008–present) ====
The management of the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet was transferred from MSCO to Rosatom in 2008. In October 2009, the general director of Atomflot announced that &quot;Sevmorput&quot; could remain in service for 15 years.

In late October 2012, it was reported that &quot;Sevmorput&quot;, which had been lying idle at the Atomflot base outside Murmansk since 2007, had been removed from the Russian Ship Register in July and would be sold for scrap. However, in December 2013 it was reported that the decision to decommission the nuclear-powered ship had been cancelled and that the vessel would be brought back to service by February 2016. Following a two-year refit and refueling of the reactor, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; left Murmansk in November 2015 for the first time in nine years to carry out sea trials in the Barents Sea.

Since returning to service in 2016, the world&#x27;s only nuclear-powered cargo ship has been chartered mainly by the Russian Ministry of Defence for transporting cargo related to the development of military infrastructure in the Arctic. In addition, the vessel has occasionally transported supplies for oil and gas projects.

In October 2018, the Russian Federal Agency for Fishery (Rosrybolovstvo), Rosatom and various Russian fishing industry organizations began discussing the possibility of transporting Pacific salmon caught in Kamchatka to western Russia along the Northern Sea Route using &quot;Sevmorput&quot;. Initially, two test shipments of 5,000tonnes of frozen fish from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Saint Petersburg were planned for 2019, but the second voyage was later cancelled after the first voyage turned out to be less profitable than expected. On 21 March 2019, &quot;Sevmporput&quot; sailed for the first time from Archangelsk to Utrenneye (Salmanovskoye) natural gas field at Gyda Peninsula to transport 17,000 tons of construction goods for Novatek&#x27;s Arctic LNG-2 project. The passage took in total of five days. The ship completed the same journey also the next year in March 2020, delivering 20,000 tons of goods.

While Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers had occasionally operated in the Gulf of Finland, &quot;Sevmorput&quot;″s pilot voyage in September 2019 marked the first time commercial cargo was carried to the Baltic Sea on board a Russian nuclear-powered vessel. While the vessel later returned to Murmansk, the sinking of the only Russian floating dock capable of accommodating the vessel in November 2018 forced &quot;Sevmorput&quot; to sail back to Saint Petersburg for propeller repairs in December 2019.

After transporting a second shipment of fish from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to Saint Petersburg in September 2020, reportedly on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; loaded prefabricated building modules for the new Vostok Station in Antarctica and departed on 5 October. This would mark the first time a nuclear-powered surface ship would sail to the Earth&#x27;s southernmost continent. After leaving the Baltic Sea and passing through the English Channel, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; headed south along the European and African coasts. However, shortly after crossing the Equator the vessel unexpectedly slowed down from its usual transit speed of about to about and, after sailing back and forth along its past track for a while, changed course towards Africa. Although Rosatomflot initially declined to comment the situation, unofficial reports implied that &quot;Sevmorput&quot; lost one of its four propeller blades and divers had to remove the opposite blade to balance the propeller. On 26 November, it was confirmed that &quot;Sevmorput&quot; would have to head back to Saint Petersburg for repairs and the construction of the new Vostok station would be postponed to 2021 due to deteriorating ice conditions in Antarctica. After a winter lay-up, the vessel was drydocked in April 2021 and the repairs were completed in July. Although metal fatigue, foreign object and improper operation were all considered potential explanations, the root cause of the propeller blade failure could not be determined.

In August 2021, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; sailed to Murmansk. After spending two months at quayside, the ship returned again to Saint Petersburg to load nuclear power plant components for Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant under construction in Bangladesh. The cargo will be shipped to Vladivostok for transshipment.

In October 2021, BSK-Rybnaya Kompaniya chartered the nuclear-powered cargo ship to transport frozen fish from Kamchatka. The first voyage along the Northern Sea Route was scheduled for November 2021.

In October 2023, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; was one of the ships suspected by Finnish police of possible involvement in damage to the Balticconnector natural gas pipeline and telecommunication cables that occurred in the Gulf of Finland on 8 October. However, the anchor retrieved from the seabed next to the damaged pipeline was later identified as having come from the Chinese container ship &quot;Newnew Polar Bear&quot; that sailed alongside &quot;Sevmorput&quot; at the time of the incident.

On 24 December 2023, a fire broke out onboard &quot;Sevmorput&quot; while the vessel was moored at Atomflot&#x27;s base in Murmansk. The fire was reportedly contained in one of the vessel&#x27;s cabins and affected an area of about , was promptly extinguished, and caused no injuries.

According to Atomflot, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; is expected to remain in service until 2024.

===General characteristics===

&quot;Sevmorput&quot; is long overall and between perpendiculars. The breadth and depth of her hull are and , respectively. When loaded to the summer waterline, the ship draws of water. However, in ice-covered waters she operates with a slightly smaller draught of to improve the icebreaking characteristics of her raked stem. The gross tonnage of &quot;Sevmorput&quot; is 38,226 and net tonnage 11,468. The ship&#x27;s deadweight tonnage is 33,980 tons at maximum draught and 26,480 tons while operating at reduced draught in ice. Her maximum displacement is 61,880 tons.

Although originally designed according to the USSR Register of Shipping rules of 1981 to the highest Soviet ice class available for merchant ships, ULA, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; is currently classified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping with a slightly lower ice class, UL. In addition to the national rules she was built according to the latest international regulations and conventions at the time, becoming the first ship built according to the &quot;Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships&quot; adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1981. Special attention was paid to the safety aspects of the vessel and, in addition to running aground or colliding with the reinforced bow of an icebreaker, the Soviet naval architects even took into account the possibility of a passenger aircraft crashing on &quot;Sevmorput&quot;.

===Power and propulsion===

&quot;Sevmorput&quot; is powered by a single KLT-40 nuclear fission reactor with a thermal output of 135 megawatts. The reactor core contains of 30–40- or 90-percent enriched uranium in uranium-zirconium alloy and has reportedly required refueling only twice. The nuclear power plant on board the vessel produces 215 tons of steam per hour at a pressure level of and temperature of . In case of emergency steam can also be produced by a diesel-powered boiler (50 t/h, 2.45 MPa, 360 °C).

Unlike the Russian &quot;Arktika&quot;- and &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class nuclear-powered icebreakers, which have three fixed-pitch propellers and utilize nuclear-turbo-electric powertrain, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; is propelled by a single 4-bladed ducted controllable-pitch propeller mechanically coupled to a GTZA 684 OM5 steam turbine which has a maximum output of and turns the propeller at 115 rpm. At full power the propulsion system gives the ship a maximum speed of at a draught of . She can also maintain a speed of in thick level ice.

For electricity production &quot;Sevmorput&quot; has three 1,700 kW turbogenerators and three 2,000 kW standby diesel generators. In addition in case of blackout the vessel also has two 200 kW emergency diesel generators.

===Cargo capacity and handling===
&quot;Sevmorput&quot; can carry 74 lighters, each with a cargo capacity of 300 tons, in six holds and in two layers on the stern deck. The cargo hold hatches are designed for lighters with a total weight of 450 tons. The lighters are loaded and unloaded with a large gantry crane, manufactured by KONE, with a span of and lifting capacity of 500 tons. The gantry crane has two three-ton auxiliary cranes.

When not carrying lighters, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; can carry both 20- and 40-foot containers weighing up to 20.3 and 30.5 tons, respectively, in three layers. The total container capacity of the ship is . While loading and unloading are usually done by shore-based cranes, a small number of containers can be handled with two container attachments to the gantry crane in ports that do not have cranes capable of handling containers. The lifting capacity of the attachments is 38 tons. Later, &quot;Sevmorput&quot; has been fitted with two Russian-manufactured 60-tonne hydraulic boom cranes with a lifting radius of . The new cranes can also be used in tandem to lift 120-tonne loads.

<doc id="482938" wikidata="Q1571080" url="?curid=482938" title="Medieval medicine of Western Europe">
<text>In the Middle Ages, the medicine of Western Europe was composed of a mixture of existing ideas from antiquity. In the Early Middle Ages, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, standard medical knowledge was based chiefly upon surviving Greek and Roman texts, preserved in monasteries and elsewhere. Medieval medicine is widely misunderstood, thought of as a uniform attitude composed of placing hopes in the church and God to heal all sicknesses, while sickness itself exists as a product of destiny, sin, and astral influences as physical causes. But, especially in the second half of the medieval period (c. 1100–1500 AD), medieval medicine became a formal body of theoretical knowledge and was institutionalized in universities. Medieval medicine attributed illnesses, and disease, not to sinful behavior, but to natural causes, and sin was connected to illness only in a more general sense of the view that disease manifested in humanity as a result of its fallen state from God. Medieval medicine also recognized that illnesses spread from person to person, that certain lifestyles may cause ill health, and some people have a greater predisposition towards bad health than others.

==Influences==
===Hippocratic medicine===
The Western medical tradition often traces its roots directly to the Ancient Greek civilization, much like the foundation of all of Western society. The Greeks certainly laid the foundation for Western medical practice but much more of Western medicine can be traced to the Near East, Germanic, and Celtic cultures. The Greek medical foundation comes from a collection of writings known today as the Hippocratic Corpus. Remnants of the Hippocratic Corpus survive in modern medicine in forms like the &quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot; as in to &quot;Do No Harm&quot;.

The Hippocratic Corpus, popularly attributed to an Ancient Greek medical practitioner known as Hippocrates, lays out the basic approach to health care. Ancient Greek philosophers viewed the human body as a system that reflects the workings of nature and Hippocrates applied this belief to medicine. The body, as a reflection of natural forces, contained four elemental properties expressed to the Greeks as the four humors. The humors represented fire, air, earth, and water through the properties of hot, cold, dry, and moist, respectively. Health in the human body relied on keeping these humors in balance within each person.

Maintaining the balance of humors within a patient occurred in several ways. An initial examination took place as standard for a physician to properly evaluate the patient. The patient&#x27;s home climate, their usual diet, and astrological charts were regarded during a consultation. The heavens influenced each person in different ways by influencing elements connected to certain humors, important information in reaching a diagnosis. After the examination, the physician could determine which humor was unbalanced in the patient and prescribe a new diet to restore that balance. Diet included not only food to eat or avoid but also an exercise regimen and medication.

Hippocratic medicine was written down within the Hippocratic Corpus, therefore medical practitioners were required to be literate. The written treatises within the Corpus are varied, incorporating medical doctrine from any source the Greeks came into contact with. At Alexandria in Ancient Egypt, the Greeks learned the art of surgery and dissection; the Egyptian skill in these arenas far surpassed those of Greeks and Romans due to social taboos regarding treatment of the dead. The early Hippocratic practitioner Herophilus engaged in dissection and added new knowledge to human anatomy in the realms of the human nervous system, the inner workings of the eye, differentiating arteries from veins, and using pulses as a diagnostic tool in treatment. Surgery and dissection yielded much knowledge of the human body that Hippocratic physicians employed alongside their methods of balancing humors in patients. The combination of knowledge in diet, surgery, and medication formed the foundation of medical learning upon which Galen would later build upon with his own works.

===Temple healing===
The Greeks were influenced by their Egyptian neighbours, in terms of medical practice in surgery and medication. They also absorbed many folk healing practices, including incantations and dream healing. In Homer&#x27;s epic poems &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Greek gods are implicated as the cause of plagues or widespread disease and that those maladies could be cured by praying to them. The religious side of Greek medical practice is clearly manifested in the cult of Asclepius, whom Homer regarded as a great physician and who was deified in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Hundreds of temples devoted to Asclepius were founded throughout the Hellenistic and Roman Empire to which untold numbers of people flocked for cures. Healing visions and dreams formed the foundation for the curing process as the person seeking treatment from Asclepius slept in a special dormitory. The healing occurred either in the person&#x27;s dream or advice from the dream could be used to seek out the proper treatment for their illness elsewhere. Afterwards the visitor to the temple bathed, offered prayers and sacrifice, and received other forms of treatment like medication, dietary restrictions, and an exercise regiment, in keeping with the Hippocratic tradition.
===Pagan and folk medicine===
Some of the medicine in the Middle Ages had its roots in Pagan and folk practices. This influence was highlighted by the interplay between Christian theologians who adopted aspects of Pagan and folk practices and chronicled them in their own works. The practices adopted by Christian medical practitioners around the 2nd century CE, and their attitudes toward Pagan and folk traditions, reflected an understanding of these practices, especially humoralism and herbalism.

The practice of medicine in the early Middle Ages was empirical and pragmatic. It focused mainly on curing diseases rather than discovering the cause of diseases. Often it was believed the cause of disease was supernatural. Nevertheless, secular approaches to curing diseases existed. People in the Middle Ages understood medicine by adopting the ancient Greek medical theory of humors. Since it was clear that the fertility of the earth depended on the proper balance of the elements, it followed that the same was true for the body, within which the various humors had to be in balance. This approach greatly influenced medical theory throughout the Middle Ages.

Folk medicine of the Middle Ages dealt with the use of herbal remedies for ailments. The practice of keeping physic gardens teeming with various herbs with medicinal properties was influenced by the gardens of Roman antiquity. Many early medieval manuscripts have been noted for containing practical descriptions for the use of herbal remedies. These texts, such as the Pseudo-Apuleius, included illustrations of various plants that would have been easily identifiable and familiar to Europeans at the time. Monasteries later became centers of medical practice in the Middle Ages, and carried on the tradition of maintaining medicinal gardens. These gardens became specialized and capable of maintaining plants from the Southern Hemisphere as well as maintaining plants during winter.

Hildegard of Bingen was an example of a medieval medical practitioner who, while educated in classical Greek medicine, also utilized folk medicine remedies. Her understanding of the plant based medicines informed her commentary on the humors of the body and the remedies she described in her medical text &quot;Causae et curae&quot; were influenced by her familiarity with folk treatments of disease. In the rural society of Hildegard&#x27;s time, much of the medical care was provided by women, along with their other domestic duties. Kitchens were stocked with herbs and other substances required in folk remedies for many ailments. &quot;Causae et curae&quot; illustrated a view of symbiosis of the body and nature, that the understanding of nature could inform medical treatment of the body. However, Hildegard maintained the belief that the root of disease was a compromised relationship between a person and God. Many parallels between pagan and Christian ideas about disease existed during the early Middle Ages. Christian views of disease differed from those held by pagans because of a fundamental difference in belief: Christians&#x27; belief in a personal relationship with God greatly influenced their views on medicine.

Evidence of pagan influence on emerging Christian medical practice was provided by many prominent early Christian thinkers, such as Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and Augustine, who studied natural philosophy and held important aspects of secular Greek philosophy that were in line with Christian thought. They believed faith supported by sound philosophy was superior to simple faith. The classical idea of the physician as a selfless servant who had to endure unpleasant tasks and provide necessary, often painful treatment was of great influence on early Christian practitioners. The metaphor was not lost on Christians who viewed Christ as the ultimate physician. Pagan philosophy had previously held that the pursuit of virtue should not be secondary to bodily concerns. Similarly, Christians felt that, while caring for the body was important, it was second to spiritual pursuits. The relationship between faith and the body&#x27;s ailments explains why most medieval medical practice was performed by Christian monks.

===Monasteries===

Monasteries developed not only as spiritual centers, but also centers of intellectual learning and medical practice. Locations of the monasteries were secluded and designed to be self-sufficient, which required the monastic inhabitants to produce their own food and also care for their sick. Prior to the development of hospitals, people from the surrounding towns looked to the monasteries for help with their sick.

A combination of both spiritual and natural healing was used to treat the sick. Herbal remedies, known as Herbals, along with prayer and other religious rituals were used in treatment by the monks and nuns of the monasteries. Herbs were seen by the monks and nuns as one of God’s creations for the natural aid that contributed to the spiritual healing of the sick individual. An herbal textual tradition also developed in the medieval monasteries. Older herbal Latin texts were translated and also expanded in the monasteries. The monks and nuns reorganized older texts so that they could be utilized more efficiently, adding a table of contents for example to help find information quickly. Not only did they reorganize existing texts, but they also added or eliminated information. New herbs that were discovered to be useful or specific herbs that were known in a particular geographic area were added. Herbs that proved to be ineffective were eliminated. Drawings were also added or modified in order for the reader to effectively identify the herb. The Herbals that were being translated and modified in the monasteries were some of the first medical texts produced and used in medical practice in the Middle Ages.

Not only were herbal texts being produced, but also other medieval texts that discussed the importance of the humors. Monasteries in medieval Europe gained access to Greek medical works by the middle of the 6th century. Monks translated these works into Latin, after which they were gradually disseminated across Europe. Monks such as Arnald of Villanova also translated the works of Galen and other classical Greek scholars from Arabic to Latin during the Middle Ages. By producing these texts and translating them into Latin, Christian monks both preserved classical Greek medical information and allowed for its use by European medical practitioners. By the early 1300s these translated works would become available at medieval universities, forming the foundation of medical education.

Hildegard of Bingen, a well known abbess, wrote about Hippocratic Medicine using humoral theory and how balance and imbalance of the elements affected the health of an individual, along with other known sicknesses of the time, and ways in which to combine both prayer and herbs to help the individual become well. She discusses different symptoms that were common to see and the known remedies for them.

In exchanging the herbal texts among monasteries, monks became aware of herbs that could be very useful but were not found in the surrounding area. The monastic clergy traded with one another or used commercial means to obtain the foreign herbs. Inside most of the monastery grounds there had been a separate garden designated for the plants that were needed for the treatment of the sick. A serving plan of St. Gall depicts a separate garden to be developed for strictly medical herbals. Monks and nuns also devoted a large amount of their time in the cultivation of the herbs they felt were necessary in the care of the sick. Some plants were not native to the local area and needed special care to be kept alive. The monks used a form of science, what we would today consider botany, to cultivate these plants. Foreign herbs and plants determined to be highly valuable were grown in gardens in close proximity to the monastery in order for the monastic clergy to hastily have access to the natural remedies. 

Medicine in the monasteries was concentrated on assisting the individual to return to normal health. Being able to identify symptoms and remedies was the primary focus. In some instances identifying the symptoms led the monastic clergy to have to take into consideration the cause of the illness in order to implement a solution. Research and experimental processes were continuously being implemented in monasteries to be able to successfully fulfill their duties to God to take care of all God&#x27;s people.

===Christian charity===
Christian practice and attitudes toward medicine drew on Middle Eastern (particularly from local Jews) and Greek influences. The Jews took their duty to care for their fellow Jews seriously. This duty extended to lodging and medical treatment of pilgrims to the temple at Jerusalem. Temporary medical assistance had been provided in classical Greece for visitors to festivals and the tradition extended through the Roman Empire, especially after Christianity became the state religion prior to the empire&#x27;s decline. In the early medieval period, hospitals, poor houses, hostels, and orphanages began to spread from the Middle East, each with the intention of helping those most in need.

Charity, the driving principle behind these healing centers, encouraged the early Christians to care for others. The cities of Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Antioch contained some of the earliest and most complex hospitals, with many beds to house patients and staff physicians with emerging specialties. Some hospitals were large enough to provide education in medicine, surgery and patient care. St. Basil (AD 330–79) argued that God put medicines on the Earth for human use, while many early church fathers agreed that Hippocratic medicine could be used to treat the sick and satisfy the charitable need to help others.

===Medicine===
Medieval European medicine became more developed during the Renaissance of the 12th century, when many medical texts both on Ancient Greek medicine and on Islamic medicine were translated from Greek and Arabic during the 13th century. The most influential among these texts was Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, a medical encyclopedia written in &quot;circa&quot; 1030 which summarized the medicine of Greek, Indian and Muslim physicians until that time. The &quot;Canon&quot; became an authoritative text in European medical education until the early modern period. Other influential texts from Jewish authors include the &quot;Liber pantegni&quot; by Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, while Arabic authors contributed &quot;De Gradibus&quot; by Alkindus and &quot;Al-Tasrif&quot; by Abulcasis.

At Schola Medica Salernitana in Southern Italy, medical texts from Byzantium and the Arab world (see Medicine in medieval Islam) were readily available, translated from the Greek and Arabic at the nearby monastic centre of Monte Cassino. The Salernitan masters gradually established a canon of writings, known as the &quot;ars medicinae&quot; (art of medicine) or &quot;articella&quot; (little art), which became the basis of European medical education for several centuries.

During the Crusades the influence of Islamic medicine became stronger. The influence was mutual and Islamic scholars such as Usamah ibn Munqidh also described their positive experience with European medicine – he describes a European doctor successfully treating infected wounds with vinegar and recommends a treatment for scrofula demonstrated to him by an unnamed &quot;Frank&quot;.

===Classical medicine===
Anglo-Saxon translations of classical works like Dioscorides &quot;Herbal&quot; survive from the 10th century, showing the persistence of elements of classical medical knowledge. Other influential translated medical texts at the time included the Hippocratic Corpus attributed to Hippocrates, and the writings of Galen.

Galen of Pergamon, a Greek, was one of the most influential ancient physicians. Galen described the four classic symptoms of inflammation (redness, pain, heat, and swelling) and added much to the knowledge of infectious disease and pharmacology. Galen also found that an excess of the fluids could make someone sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, or melancholic. His anatomic knowledge of humans was defective because it was based on dissection of animals, mainly apes, sheep, goats and pigs. Some of Galen&#x27;s teachings held back medical progress. His theory, for example, that the blood carried the pneuma, or life spirit, which gave it its red colour, coupled with the erroneous notion that the blood passed through a porous wall between the ventricles of the heart, delayed the understanding of circulation and did much to discourage research in physiology. His most important work, however, was in the field of the form and function of muscles and the function of the areas of the spinal cord. He also excelled in diagnosis and prognosis. Through Galen, knowledge of Greek medicine was transferred to the Western world by Arabs. 

===Medieval surgery===
Medieval surgery arose from a foundation created from ancient Egyptian, Greek and Arabic medicine. An example of such influence would be Galen, the most influential practitioner of surgical or anatomical practices that he performed while attending to gladiators at Pergamon. The accomplishments and the advancements in medicine made by the Arabic world were translated and made available to the Latin world. This new wealth of knowledge allowed for a greater interest in surgery.

In Paris, in the late thirteenth century, it was deemed that surgical practices were extremely disorganized, and so the Parisian provost decided to enlist six of the most trustworthy and experienced surgeons and have them assess the performance of other surgeons. The emergence of universities allowed for surgery to be a discipline that should be learned and be communicated to others as a uniform practice. The University of Padua was one of the &quot;leading Italian universities in teaching medicine, identification and treating of diseases and ailments, specializing in autopsies and workings of the body.&quot; The most prestigious and famous part of the university, the Anatomical Theatre of Padua, is the oldest surviving anatomical theater, in which students studied anatomy by observing their teachers perform public dissections.

Surgery was formally taught in Italy even though it was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body but they should also be well versed in the liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began to be respected and gain esteem and status.

During the Crusades, one of the duties of surgeons was to travel around a battlefield, assessing soldiers&#x27; wounds and declaring whether or not the soldier was deceased. Because of this task, surgeons were deft at removing arrowheads from their patients&#x27; bodies. Another class of surgeons that existed were barber surgeons. They were expected not only to be able to perform formal surgery, but also to be deft at cutting hair and trimming beards. Some of the surgical procedures they would conduct were bloodletting and treating sword and arrow wounds.

In the mid-fourteenth century, there were restrictions placed on London surgeons as to what types of injuries they were able to treat and the types of medications that they could prescribe or use, because surgery was still looked at as an incredibly dangerous procedure that should only be used appropriately. Some of the wounds that were allowed to be performed on were external injuries, such as skin lacerations caused by a sharp edge, such as by a sword, dagger and axe or through household tools such as knives. During this time, it was also expected that the surgeons were extremely knowledgeable on human anatomy and would be held accountable for any consequences as a result of the procedure.

==Advances==
The Middle Ages contributed a great deal to medical knowledge. This period contained progress in surgery, medical chemistry, dissection, and practical medicine. The Middle Ages laid the ground work for later, more significant discoveries. There was a slow but constant progression in the way that medicine was studied and practiced. It went from apprenticeships to universities and from oral traditions to documenting texts. The most well-known preservers of texts, not only medical, would be the monasteries. The monks were able to copy and revise any medical texts that they were able to obtain.

Besides documentation the Middle Ages also had one of the first well known female physicians, Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard was born in 1098 and at the age of fourteen she entered the double monastery of Dissibodenberg. She wrote the medical text Causae et curae, in which many medical practices of the time were demonstrated. This book contained diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of many different diseases and illnesses. This text sheds light on medieval medical practices of the time. It also demonstrates the vast amount of knowledge and influences that she built upon. In this time period medicine was taken very seriously, as is shown with Hildegard&#x27;s detailed descriptions on how to perform medical tasks. The descriptions are nothing without their practical counterpart, and Hildegard was thought to have been an infirmarian in the monastery where she lived. An infirmarian treated not only other monks but pilgrims, workers, and the poor men, women, and children in the monastery&#x27;s hospice. Because monasteries were located in rural areas the infirmarian was also responsible for the care of lacerations, fractures, dislocations, and burns. Along with typical medical practice the text also hints that the youth (such as Hildegard) would have received hands-on training from the previous infirmarian. Beyond routine nursing this also shows that medical remedies from plants, either grown or gathered, had a significant impact of the future of medicine. This was the beginnings of the domestic pharmacy.

Although plants were the main source of medieval remedies, around the sixteenth century medical chemistry became more prominent. &quot;Medical chemistry began with the adaptation of chemical processes to the preparation of medicine&quot;. Previously medical chemistry was characterized by any use of inorganic materials, but it was later refined to be more technical, like the processes of distillation. John of Rupescissa&#x27;s works in alchemy and the beginnings of medical chemistry is recognized for the bounds in chemistry. His works in making the philosopher&#x27;s stone, also known as the fifth essence, were what made he became known for. Distillation techniques were mostly used, and it was said that by reaching a substance&#x27;s purest form the person would find the fifth essence, and this is where medicine comes in. Remedies were able to be made more potent because there was now a way to remove nonessential elements. This opened many doors for medieval physicians as new, different remedies were made. Medical chemistry provided an &quot;increasing body of pharmacological literature dealing with the use of medicines derived from mineral sources&quot;. Medical chemistry also shows the use of alcohols in medicine. Though these events were not huge bounds for the field, they were influential in determining the course of science. It was the start of differentiation between alchemy and chemistry.

The Middle Ages brought a new way of thinking and a lessening on the taboo of dissection. Dissection for medical purposes became more prominent around 1299. During this time the Italians were practicing anatomical dissection and the first record of an autopsy dates from 1286. Dissection was first introduced in the educational setting at the university of Bologna, to study and teach anatomy. The fourteenth century saw a significant spread of dissection and autopsy in Italy, and was not only taken up by medical faculties, but by colleges for physicians and surgeons.

Roger Frugardi of Parma composed his treatise on &quot;Surgery&quot; around about 1180. Between 1250 and 1265 Theodoric Borgognoni produced a systematic four volume treatise on surgery, the &quot;Cyrurgia&quot;, which promoted important innovations as well as early forms of antiseptic practice in the treatment of injury, and surgical anaesthesia using a mixture of opiates and herbs.

Compendiums like Bald&#x27;s &quot;Leechbook&quot; (circa 900), include citations from a variety of classical works alongside local folk remedies.

==Theories of medicine==
Although each of these theories has distinct roots in different cultural and religious traditions, they were all intertwined in the general understanding and practice of medicine. For example, the Benedictine abbess and healer, Hildegard of Bingen, claimed that black bile and other humour imbalances were directly caused by presence of the Devil and by sin. Another example of the fusion of different medicinal theories is the combination of Christian and pre-Christian ideas about &quot;elf-shot&quot; (elf- or fairy-caused diseases) and their appropriate treatments. The idea that elves caused disease was a pre-Christian belief that developed into the Christian idea of disease-causing demons or devils. Treatments for this and other types of illness reflected the coexistence of Christian and pre-Christian or pagan ideas of medicine.

===Humours===
The theory of humours was derived from the ancient medical works and was accepted until the 19th century. The theory stated that within every individual there were four humours, or principal fluids – black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood, these were produced by various organs in the body, and they had to be in balance for a person to remain healthy. Too much phlegm in the body, for example, caused lung problems; and the body tried to cough up the phlegm to restore a balance. The balance of humours in humans could be achieved by diet, medicines, and by blood-letting, using leeches. Leeches were usually starved the day before application to a patient in order to increase their efficiency. The four humours were also associated with the four seasons; black bile with autumn, yellow bile with summer, phlegm with winter and blood with spring.

The astrological signs of the zodiac were also thought to be associated with certain humours 
. Even now, some still use words &quot;choleric&quot;, &quot;sanguine&quot;, &quot;phlegmatic&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot; to describe personalities.

===Herbalism and botany===

Herbs were commonly used in salves and drinks to treat a range of maladies. The particular herbs used depended largely on the local culture and often had roots in pre-Christian religion. The success of herbal remedies was often ascribed to their action upon the humours within the body. The use of herbs also drew upon the medieval Christian doctrine of signatures which stated that God had provided some form of alleviation for every ill, and that these things, be they animal, vegetable or mineral, carried a mark or a &quot;signature&quot; upon them that gave an indication of their usefulness. For example, skullcap seeds (used as a headache remedy) can appear to look like miniature skulls; and the white spotted leaves of lungwort (used for tuberculosis) bear a similarity to the lungs of a diseased patient. A large number of such resemblances were believed to exist.

Many monasteries developed herb gardens for use in the production of herbal cures, and these remained a part of folk medicine, as well as being used by some professional physicians. Books of herbal remedies were produced, one of the most famous being the Welsh, &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, dating from around 1400.

During the early Middle Ages, botany had undergone drastic changes from that of its antiquity predecessor (Greek practice). An early medieval treatise in the West on plants known as the Ex herbis femininis was largely based on Dioscorides Greek text: De material medica. The Ex herbis was a lot more popular during this time because it was not only easier to read, but contained plants and their remedies that related to the regions of southern Europe, where botany was being studied. It also provided better medical direction on how to create remedies, and how to properly use them. This book was also highly illustrated, where its former was not, making the practice of botany easier to comprehend.

The re-emergence of Botany in the medieval world came about during the sixteenth century. As part of the revival of classical medicine, one of the biggest areas of interest was materia medica: the study of remedial substances. “Italian humanists in the fifteenth century had recovered and translated ancient Greek botanical texts which had been unknown in the West in the Middle Ages or relatively ignored”. Soon after the rise in interest in botany, universities such as Padua and Bologna started to create programs and fields of study; some of these practices including setting up gardens so that students were able to collect and examine plants. “Botany was also a field in which printing made a tremendous impact, through the development of naturalistic illustrated herbals”. During this time period, university practices were highly concerned with the philosophical matters of study in sciences and the liberal arts, “but by the sixteenth century both scholastic discussion of plants and reliance upon intermediary compendia for plant names and descriptions were increasingly abandoned in favor of direct study of the original texts of classical authors and efforts to reconcile names, descriptions, and plants in nature”. Botanist expanded their knowledge of different plant remedies, seeds, bulbs, uses of dried and living plants through continuous interchange made possible by printing. In sixteenth century medicine, botany was rapidly becoming a lively and fast-moving discipline that held wide universal appeal in the world of doctors, philosophers, and pharmacists.

===Mental disorders===

Those with mental disorders in medieval Europe were treated using a variety of different methods, depending on the beliefs of the physician they would go to. Some doctors at the time believed that supernatural forces such as witches, demons or possession caused mental disorders. These physicians believed that prayers and incantations, along with exorcisms, would cure the afflicted and relieve them of their suffering. Another form of treatment existed to help expel evil spirits from the body of a patient, known as trephining. Trephining was a means of treating epilepsy by opening a hole in the skull through drilling or cutting. It was believed that any evil spirit or evil air would flow out of the body through the hole and leave the patient in peace. Contrary to the common belief that most physicians in medieval Europe believed that mental illness was caused by supernatural factors, it is believed that these were only the minority of cases related to the diagnosis and treatment of those suffering from mental disorders. Most physicians believed that these disorders were caused by physical factors, such as the malfunction of organs or an imbalance of the humors. One of the most well-known and reported examples was the belief that an excess amount of black bile was the cause of melancholia, which would now be classified as schizophrenia or depression. Medieval physicians used various forms of treatment to try to fix any physical problems that were causing mental disorders in their patients. When the cause of the disorder being examined was believed to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors, doctors attempted to rebalance the body. They did so through a combination of emetics, laxatives and different methods of bloodletting, in order to remove excess amounts of bodily fluids.

===Christian interpretation===

Medicine in the Middle Ages was rooted in Christianity through not only the spread of medical texts through monastic tradition but also through the beliefs of sickness in conjunction with medical treatment and theory. Christianity, throughout the medieval period, did not set medical knowledge back or forwards. The church taught that God sometimes sent illness as a punishment, and that in these cases, repentance could lead to a recovery. This led to the practice of penance and pilgrimage as a means of curing illness. In the Middle Ages, some people did not consider medicine a profession suitable for Christians, as disease was often considered God-sent. God was considered to be the &quot;divine physician&quot; who sent illness or healing depending on his will. From a Christian perspective, disease could be seen either as a punishment from God or as an affliction of demons (or elves, see first paragraph under Theories of Medicine). The ultimate healer in this interpretation is of course God, but medical practitioners cited both the Bible and Christian history as evidence that humans could and should attempt to cure diseases. For example, the &quot;Lorsch Book of Remedies&quot; or the &quot;Lorsch Leechbook&quot; contains a lengthy defense of medical practice from a Christian perspective. Christian treatments focused on the power of prayer and holy words, as well as liturgical practice.

However, many monastic orders, particularly the Benedictines, were very involved in healing and caring for the sick and dying. In many cases, the Greek philosophy that early medieval medicine was based upon was compatible with Christianity. Though the widespread Christian tradition of sickness being a divine intervention in reaction to sin was popularly believed throughout the Middle Ages, it did not rule out natural causes. For example, the Black Death was thought to have been caused by both divine and natural origins. The plague was thought to have been a punishment from God for sinning, however because it was believed that God was the reason for all natural phenomena, the physical cause of the plague could be scientifically explained as well. One of the more widely accepted scientific explanations of the plague was the corruption of air in which pollutants such as rotting matter or anything that gave the air an unpleasant scent caused the spread of the plague.

Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) played an important role in how illness was interpreted through both God and natural causes through her medical texts as well. As a nun, she believed in the power of God and prayer to heal, however she also recognized that there were natural forms of healing through the humors as well. Though there were cures for illness outside of prayer, ultimately the patient was in the hands of God. One specific example of this comes from her text &quot;Causae et Curae&quot; in which she explains the practice of bleeding:
Bleeding, says Hildegard, should be done when the moon is waning, because then the &quot;blood is low&quot; (77:23–25). Men should be bled from the age of twelve (120:32) to eighty (121:9), but women, because they have more of the detrimental humors, up to the age of one hundred (121:24). For therapeutic bleeding, use the veins nearest the diseased part (122:19); for preventive bleeding, use the large veins in the arms (121:35–122:11), because they are like great rivers whose tributaries irrigate the body (123:6–9, 17–20). 24 From a strong man, take &quot;the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp&quot; (119:20); from a weak one, &quot;the amount that an egg of moderate size can hold&quot; (119:22–23). Afterward, let the patient rest for three days and give him undiluted wine (125:30), because &quot;wine is the blood of the earth&quot; (141:26). This blood can be used for prognosis; for instance, &quot;if the blood comes out turbid like a man&#x27;s breath, and if there are black spots in it, and if there is a waxy layer around it, then the patient will die, unless God restore him to life&quot; (124:20–24).
Monasteries were also important in the development of hospitals throughout the Middle Ages, where the care of sick members of the community was an important obligation. These monastic hospitals were not only for the monks who lived at the monasteries but also the pilgrims, visitors and surrounding population. The monastic tradition of herbals and botany influenced medieval medicine as well, not only in their actual medicinal uses but in their textual traditions. Texts on herbal medicine were often copied in monasteries by monks, but there is substantial evidence that these monks were also practicing the texts that they were copying. These texts were progressively modified from one copy to the next, with notes and drawings added into the margins as the monks learned new things and experimented with the remedies and plants that the books supplied. Monastic translations of texts continued to influence medicine as many Greek medical works were translated into Arabic. Once these Arabic texts were available, monasteries in western Europe were able to translate them, which in turn would help shape and redirect Western medicine in the later Middle Ages. The ability for these texts to spread from one monastery or school in adjoining regions created a rapid diffusion of medical texts throughout western Europe.

The influence of Christianity continued into the later periods of the Middle Ages as medical training and practice moved out of the monasteries and into cathedral schools, though more for the purpose of general knowledge rather than training professional physicians. The study of medicine was eventually institutionalized into the medieval universities. Even within the university setting, religion dictated a lot of the medical practice being taught. For instance, the debate of when the spirit left the body influenced the practice of dissection within the university setting. The universities in the south believed that the soul only animated the body and left immediately upon death. Because of this, the body while still important, went from being a subject to an object. However, in the north they believed that it took longer for the soul to leave as it was an integral part of the body. Though medical practice had become a professional and institutionalized field, the argument of the soul in the case of dissection shows that the foundation of religion was still an important part of medical thought in the late Middle Ages.

== Medical universities in medieval Europe ==
Medicine was not a formal area of study in the early medieval era, but it grew in response to the proliferation of translated Greek and Arabic medical texts in the 11th century. Western Europe also experienced economic, population and urban growth in the 12th and 13th centuries leading to the ascent of medieval medical universities. The University of Salerno was considered to be a renowned provenance of medical practitioners in the 9th and 10th centuries, but was not recognized as an official medical university until 1231. The founding of the Universities of Bologna (1088), Paris (1150), Oxford (1167), Montpellier (1181), Padua (1222) and Lleida (1297) extended the initial work of Salerno across Europe, and by the 13th century, medical leadership had passed to these newer institutions. Despite Salerno&#x27;s important contributions to the foundation of the medical curriculum, scholars do not consider Salerno to be one of the medieval medical universities. This is because the formal establishment of a medical curriculum occurred after the decline of Salerno&#x27;s grandeur of being a center for academic medicine.

The medieval medical universities&#x27; central concept concentrated on the balance between the humors and &quot;in the substances used for therapeutic purposes&quot;. The curriculum&#x27;s secondary concept focused on medical astrology, where celestial events were thought to influence health and disease. The medical curriculum was designed to train practitioners. Teachers of medical students were often successful physicians, practicing in conjunction with teaching. The curriculum of academic medicine was fundamentally based on translated texts and treatises attributed to Hippocrates and Galen as well as Arabic medical texts. At Montpellier&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine professors were required in 1309 to possess Galen&#x27;s books which described humors, &quot;De complexionibus&quot;, &quot;De virtutibus naturalibus&quot;, &quot;De criticis diebu&quot; so that they could teach students about Galen&#x27;s medical theory&quot;.&quot; The translated works of Hippocrates and Galen were often incomplete, and were mediated with Arabic medical texts for their &quot;independent contributions to treatment and to herbal pharmacology&quot;. Although anatomy was taught in academic medicine through the dissection of cadavers, surgery was largely independent from medical universities. The University of Bologna was the only university to grant degrees in surgery. Academic medicine also focused on actual medical practice where students would study individual cases and observe the professor visiting patients.

The required number of years to become a licensed physician varied among universities. Montpellier required students without their masters of arts to complete three and a half years of formal study and six months of outside medical practice. In 1309, the curriculum of Montpellier was changed to six years of study and eight months of outside medical practice for those without a masters of arts, whereas those with a masters of arts were only subjected to five years of study with eight months of outside medical practice. The university of Bologna required three years of philosophy, three years of astrology, and four years of attending medical lectures.

==Medical practitioners==
Members of religious orders were major sources of medical knowledge and cures. There appears to have been some controversy regarding the appropriateness of medical practice for members of religious orders. The Decree of the Second Lateran Council of 1139 advised the religious to avoid medicine because it was a well-paying job with higher social status than was appropriate for the clergy. However, this official policy was not often enforced in practice and many religious continued to practice medicine.

There were many other medical practitioners besides clergy. Academically trained doctors were particularly important in cities with universities. Medical faculty at universities figured prominently in defining medical guilds and accepted practices as well as the required qualifications for physicians. Beneath these university-educated physicians there existed a whole hierarchy of practitioners. Wallis suggests a social hierarchy with these university educated physicians on top, followed by &quot;learned surgeons; craft-trained surgeons; barber surgeons, who combined bloodletting with the removal of &quot;superfluities&quot; from the skin and head; itinerant specialist such as dentist and oculists; empirics; midwives; clergy who dispensed charitable advice and help; and, finally, ordinary family and neighbors&quot;. Each of these groups practiced medicine in their own capacity and contributed to the overall culture of medicine.

==Hospital system==

In the medieval period, the term &quot;hospital&quot; encompassed hostels for travellers, dispensaries for poor relief, clinics and surgeries for the injured, and homes for the blind, lame, elderly, and mentally ill. Monastic hospitals developed many treatments, both therapeutic and spiritual.

During the thirteenth century an immense number of hospitals were built. The Italian cities were the leaders of the movement. Milan had no fewer than a dozen hospitals and Florence before the end of the fourteenth century had some thirty hospitals. Some of these were very beautiful buildings. At Milan a portion of the general hospital was designed by Bramante and another part of it by Michelangelo. The Hospital in Sienna, built in honor of St. Catherine, has been famous ever since. Everywhere throughout Europe this hospital movement spread. Virchow, the great German pathologist, in an article on hospitals, showed that every city of Germany of five thousand inhabitants had its hospital. He traced all of this hospital movement to Pope Innocent III, and though he was least papistically inclined, Virchow did not hesitate to give extremely high praise to this pontiff for all that he had accomplished for the benefit of children and suffering mankind.

Hospitals began to appear in great numbers in France and England. Following the French Norman invasion of England, the explosion of French ideals led most medieval monasteries to develop a hospitium or hospice for pilgrims. This hospitium eventually developed into what we now understand as a hospital, with various monks and lay helpers providing the medical care for sick pilgrims and victims of the numerous plagues and chronic diseases that afflicted Medieval Western Europe. Benjamin Gordon supports the theory that the hospital – as we know it – is a French invention, but that it was originally developed for isolating lepers and plague victims, and only later undergoing modification to serve the pilgrim.

Owing to a well-preserved 12th-century account of the monk Eadmer of the Canterbury cathedral, there is an excellent account of Bishop Lanfranc&#x27;s aim to establish and maintain examples of these early hospitals:

But I must not conclude my work by omitting what he did for the poor outside the walls of the city Canterbury. In brief, he constructed a decent and ample house of stone…for different needs and conveniences. He divided the main building into two, appointing one part for men oppressed by various kinds of infirmities and the other for women in a bad state of health. He also made arrangements for their clothing and daily food, appointing ministers and guardians to take all measures so that nothing should be lacking for them.

==Later developments==
High medieval surgeons like Mondino de Liuzzi pioneered anatomy in European universities and conducted systematic human dissections. Unlike pagan Rome, high medieval Europe did not have a complete ban on human dissection. However, Galenic influence was still so prevalent that Mondino and his contemporaries attempted to fit their human findings into Galenic anatomy.

During the period of the Renaissance from the mid 1450s onward, there were many advances in medical practice. The Italian Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553) was the first to propose that epidemic diseases might be caused by objects outside the body that could be transmitted by direct or indirect contact. He also proposed new treatments for diseases such as syphilis.

In 1543 the Flemish Scholar Andreas Vesalius wrote the first complete textbook on human anatomy: &quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica&quot;, meaning &quot;On the Fabric of the Human Body&quot;. Much later, in 1628, William Harvey explained the circulation of blood through the body in veins and arteries. It was previously thought that blood was the product of food and was absorbed by muscle tissue.

During the 16th century, Paracelsus, like Girolamo, discovered that illness was caused by agents outside the body such as bacteria, not by imbalances within the body.

The French army doctor Ambroise Paré, born in 1510, revived the ancient Greek method of tying off blood vessels. After amputation the common procedure was to cauterize the open end of the amputated appendage to stop the haemorrhaging. This was done by heating oil, water, or metal and touching it to the wound to seal off the blood vessels. Pare also believed in dressing wounds with clean bandages and ointments, including one he made himself composed of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine. He was the first to design artificial hands and limbs for amputation patients. On one of the artificial hands, the two pairs of fingers could be moved for simple grabbing and releasing tasks and the hand looked perfectly natural underneath a glove.

Medical catastrophes were more common in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance than they are today. During the Renaissance, trade routes were the perfect means of transportation for disease. Eight hundred years after the Plague of Justinian, the bubonic plague returned to Europe. Starting in Asia, the Black Death reached Mediterranean and western Europe in 1348 (possibly from Italian merchants fleeing fighting in Crimea), and killed 25 million Europeans in six years, approximately 1/3 of the total population and up to a 2/3 level in the worst-affected urban areas. Before Mongols left Crimean Kaffa in the siege of Kaffa, the dead or dying bodies of the infected soldiers were loaded onto catapults and launched over Kaffa&#x27;s walls to infect those inside. This incident was among the earliest known examples of biological warfare and is credited as being the source of the spread of the Black Death into Europe.

The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean from 14th through 17th centuries. Notable later outbreaks include the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, the Great Plague of Seville (1647–1652), the Great Plague of London (1665–1666), the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720–1722 and the 1771 plague in Moscow.

Before the Spanish discovered the New World (continental America), the deadly infections of smallpox, measles, and influenza were unheard of. The Native Americans did not have the immunities the Europeans developed through long contact with the diseases. Christopher Columbus ended the Americas&#x27; isolation in 1492 while sailing under the flag of Castile, Spain. Deadly epidemics swept across the Caribbean. Smallpox wiped out villages in a matter of months. The island of Hispaniola had a population of 250,000 Native Americans. 20 years later, the population had dramatically dropped to 6,000. 50 years later, it was estimated that approximately 500 Native Americans were left. Smallpox then spread to the area which is now Mexico where it then helped destroy the Aztec Empire. In the 1st century of Spanish rule in what is now Mexico, 1500–1600, Central and South Americans died by the millions. By 1650, the majority of the New Spain (now Mexico) population had perished.

Contrary to popular belief bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire. Bathing in fact did not fall out of fashion in Europe until shortly after the Renaissance, replaced by the heavy use of sweat-bathing and perfume, as it was thought in Europe that water could carry disease into the body through the skin. Medieval church authorities believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease. Roman Catholic Church officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt syphilis epidemics from sweeping Europe.

== Battlefield medicine ==

=== Camp and movement ===
In order for an army to be in good fighting condition, it must maintain the health of its soldiers. One way of doing this is knowing the proper location to set up camp. Military camps were not to be set up in any sort of marshy region. Marsh lands tend to have standing water, which can draw in mosquitos. Mosquitos, in turn, can carry deadly disease, such as malaria. As the camp and troops were needed to be moved, the troops would be wearing heavy soled shoes in order to prevent wear on soldiers&#x27; feet. Waterborne illness has also remained an issue throughout the centuries. When soldiers would look for water they would be searching for some sort of natural spring or other forms of flowing water. When water sources were found, any type of rotting wood, or plant material, would be removed before the water was used for drinking. If these features could not be removed, then water would be drawn from a different part of the source. By doing this the soldiers were more likely to be drinking from a safe source of water. Thus, water borne bacteria had less chance of making soldiers ill. One process used to check for dirty water was to moisten a fine white linen cloth with the water and leave it out to dry. If the cloth had any type of stain, it would be considered to be diseased. If the cloth was clean, the water was healthy and drinkable. Freshwater also assists with sewage disposal, as well as wound care. Thus, a source of fresh water was a preemptive measure taken to defeat disease and keep men healthy once they were wounded.

=== Physicians ===

==== Surgeons ====
In Medieval Europe the surgeon&#x27;s social status improved greatly as their expertise was needed on the battlefield. Owing to the number of patients, warfare created a unique learning environment for these surgeons. The dead bodies also provided an opportunity for learning. The corpses provided a means to learn through hands on experience. As war declined, the need for surgeons declined as well. This would follow a pattern, where the status of the surgeon would flux in regards to whether or not there was actively a war going on.

==== First medical schools ====
Medical school also first appeared in the medieval period. This created a divide between physicians trained in the classroom and physicians who learned their trade through practice. The divide created a shift leading to physicians trained in the classroom to be of higher esteem and more knowledgeable. Despite this, there was still a lack of knowledge by physicians in the militaries. The knowledge of the militaries&#x27; physicians was greatly acquired through first hand experience. In the Medical schools, physicians such as Galen were referenced as the ultimate source of knowledge. Thus, the education in the schools was aimed at proving these ancient physicians were correct. This created issues as medieval knowledge surpassed the knowledge of these ancient physicians. In the scholastic setting it still became practice to reference ancient physicians or the other information being presented was not taken seriously.

==== Level of care ====
The soldiers that received medical attention was most likely from a physician who was not well trained. To add to this, a soldier did not have a good chance of surviving a wound that needed specific, specialized, or knowledgeable treatment. Surgery was oftentimes performed by a surgeon who knew it as a craft. There were a handful of surgeons such as Henry de Mondeville, who were very proficient and were employed by Kings such as King Phillip. However; this was not always enough to save kings’ lives, as King Richard I of England died of wounds at the siege of Chalus in AD 1199 due to an unskilled arrow extraction.

=== Wound treatment ===

==== Arrow extraction ====
Treating a wound was and remains the most crucial part of any battlefield medicine, as this is what keeps soldiers alive. As remains true on the modern battlefield, hemorrhaging and shock were the number one killers. Thus, the initial control of these two things were of the utmost importance in medieval medicine. Items such as the long bow were used widely throughout the medieval period, thus making arrow extracting a common practice among the armies of medieval Europe. When extracting an arrow, there were three guidelines that were to be followed. The physicians should first examine the position of the arrow and the degree to which its parts are visible, the possibility of it being poisoned, the location of the wound, and the possibility of contamination with dirt and other debris. The second rule was to extract it delicately and swiftly. The third rule was to stop the flow of blood from the wound.

The arrowheads that were used against troops were typically not barbed or hooked, but were slim and designed to penetrate armor such as chain mail. Although this design may be useful as wounds were smaller, these arrows were more likely to embed in bone, making them harder to extract. If the arrow happened to be barbed or hooked it made the removal more challenging. Physicians would then let the wound putrefy, thus making the tissue softer and easier for arrow extraction. After a soldier was wounded he was taken to a field hospital where the wound was assessed and cleaned, then if time permitted the soldier was sent to a camp hospital where his wound was closed for good and allowed to heal.

==== Blade and knife wounds ====
Another common injury faced was those caused by blades. If the wound was too advanced for simple stitch and bandage, it would often result in amputation of the limb. Surgeons of the medieval battlefield had the practice of amputation down to an art. Typically it would have taken less than a minute for a surgeon to remove the damaged limb, and another three to four minutes to stop the bleeding. The surgeon would first place the limb on a block of wood and tie ligatures above and below the site of surgery. Then the soft tissue would be cut through, thus exposing the bone, which was then sawed through. The stump was then bandaged and left to heal. The rates of mortality among amputation patients was around 39%, that number grew to roughly 62% for those patients with a high leg amputation. Ideas of medieval surgery are often construed in modern minds as barbaric, as our view is diluted with our own medical knowledge. Surgery and medical practice in general was at its height of advancement for its time. All procedures were done with the intent to save lives, not to cause extra pain and suffering. The speed of the procedure by the surgeon was an important factor, as the limit of pain and blood loss lead to higher survival rates among these procedures.

Injuries to major arteries that caused mass blood loss were not usually treatable as shown in the evidence of archeological remains. We know this as wounds severe enough to sever major arteries left incisions on the bone which is excavated by archaeologists. Wounds were also taught to be covered to improve healing. Forms of antiseptics were also used in order to stave off infection. To dress wounds all sorts of dressing were used such as grease, absorbent dressings, spider webs, honey, ground shellfish, clay and turpentine. Some of these methods date back to Roman battlefield medicine.

==== Bone breakage ====
Sieges were a dangerous place to be, as broken bones became an issue, with soldiers falling while they scaled the wall amongst other methods of breakage. Typically, it was long bones that were fractured. These fractures were manipulated to get the bones back into their correct location. Once they were in their correct location, the wound was immobilized by either a splint or a plaster mold. The plaster mold (an early cast) was made of flour and egg whites and was applied to the injured area. Both of these methods left the bone immobilized and gave it a chance to heal.

==== Burn treatment ====
Burn treatment also required a specific approach by physicians of the time. This was due to burning oil and arrows or boiling water, which were used in combat. In the early stages of treatment there was an attempt to stop the formation of blisters. The burn was prevented from becoming dry by using anointments placed on the burn. These anointments typically consisted of vinegar, egg, rose oil, opium, and a multitude of different herbs. The ointment was applied to affected area, and then reapplied as needed.

<doc id="482939" wikidata="Q342137" url="?curid=482939" title="Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah">
<text>Abu Ali al-Mansur (; 13 August 985 – 13 February 1021), better known by his regnal name al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (), was the sixth Fatimid caliph and 16th Ismaili imam (996–1021). Al-Hakim is an important figure in a number of Shia Ismaili sects, such as the world&#x27;s 15 million Nizaris and 1–2 million Musta&#x27;lis, in addition to 2 million Druze.

Histories of al-Hakim can prove controversial, as diverse views of his life and legacy exist. Historian Paul Walker writes &quot;Ultimately, both views of him, the mad and despotic tyrant (like Germanic and Roman despots) irrationally given to killing those around him on a whim, and the ideal supreme ruler, divinely ordained and chosen, whose every action was just and righteous, were to persist, the one among his enemies and those who rebelled against him, and the other in the hearts of true believers, who, while perhaps perplexed by events, nonetheless remained avidly loyal to him to the end.&quot; Appraisals of the more controversial accounts of al-Hakim&#x27;s life and rule have earned him such monikers as &quot;the Nero of Egypt&quot;, and &quot;the Mad Caliph&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in 985 CE in Cairo, Abu &#x27;Ali al-Mansur was the first Fatimid ruler to have been born in Egypt. Abu &#x27;Ali al-Mansur had been proclaimed as heir-apparent (&quot;wali al-&#x27;ahd&quot;) in 993 CE and succeeded his father Al-Aziz Billah (975–996) at the age of eleven, on 14 October 996, with the caliphal title of &quot;al-Hakim Bi-Amr Allah&quot;. Al-Ḥākim is reported to have had blue eyes flecked with reddish gold.

===Lineage===
Al-Ḥākim was born on Thursday, 3 Rabi&#x27; al-awwal in AD 985 (AH 375). His father, caliph al-&#x27;Azīz bil-Lāh, had two consorts. One was an &quot;umm al-walad&quot; who is only known by the title &quot;as-Sayyidah al-&#x27;Azīziyyah&quot; or &quot;al-&#x27;Azīzah&quot; (d. 385/995). She was a Melkite Christian whose two brothers were appointed patriarchs of the Melkite Church by Caliph al-&#x27;Azīz. Different sources say either one of her brothers or her father was sent by al-&#x27;Azīz as an ambassador to Sicily.

Al-&#x27;Azīzah is considered to be the mother of Sitt al-Mulk, one of the most famous women in Islamic history, who had a stormy relationship with her half-brother al-Ḥākim and may have had him assassinated. Some, such as the Crusader chronicler William of Tyre, claimed that &quot;al-&#x27;Azīzah&quot; was also the mother of Caliph al-Ḥākim, though most historians dismiss this. William of Tyre went so far as to claim that al-Ḥākim&#x27;s destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009 was due to his eagerness to disprove taunts that he was a Christian born of a Christian woman. By contrast, the chronicler al-Musabbihi recounts that in 981, al-Ḥākim&#x27;s Muslim mother sought the aid of an imprisoned Islamic sage named ibn al-Washa and asked him to pray for her son who had fallen ill. The sage wrote the entire Qur&#x27;an in the inner surface of a bowl and bade her wash her son out of it. When al-Ḥākim recovered, she demanded the release of the sage in gratitude. Her request was granted and the sage and his associates were freed from prison.

Druze sources claim that al-Ḥākim&#x27;s mother was the daughter of &#x27;Abdu l-Lāh, one of al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah&#x27;s sons and therefore al-&#x27;Azīz&#x27;s niece. Historians such as Delia Cortese are critical of this claim:

== Caliphate ==

In 996, al-Ḥākim&#x27;s father Caliph al-&#x27;Azīz began a trip to visit Syria (which was held by the Fatimids only by force of arms and was under pressure from the Byzantines). The Caliph fell ill at the beginning of the trip at Bilbeis and lay in sickbed for several days. He suffered from &quot;stone with pains in the bowels.&quot; When he felt that his end was nearing he charged Qadi Muhammad ibn an-Nu&#x27;man and General Abū Muhammad al-Hasan ibn &#x27;Ammar to take care of al-Ḥākim, who was then only eleven. He then spoke to his son. Al-Ḥākim later recalled the event:

 On the following day, he and his new court proceeded from Bilbays to Cairo, behind the camel bearing his father&#x27;s body, and with the dead Caliph&#x27;s feet protruding from the litter. They arrived shortly before evening prayer and his father was buried the next evening next to the tomb of his predecessor al-Mu&#x27;īzz. Al-Ḥākim was sworn in by Barjawan, a &quot;white eunuch whom al-&#x27;Azīz had appointed as &quot;Ustad&quot; &#x27;tutor&#x27;.&quot;

Because it had been unclear whether he would inherit his father&#x27;s position, this successful transfer of power was a demonstration of the stability of the Fatimid dynasty. Al-Hakim&#x27;s father had intended the eunuch Barjawan to act as regent until al-Hakim was old enough to rule by himself. Ibn &#x27;Ammar and Qadi Muhammad ibn Nu&#x27;man were to assist in the guardianship of the new caliph.

Nevertheless, the Kutama Berbers seized the chance to recover their dominant position in the state, which had eroded under al-Aziz due to the influx of Turkish and Daylamite mercenaries from the Islamic East (the &quot;Mashāriqa&quot;, &quot;Easterners&quot;). They compelled the underage al-Hakim to dismiss the Christian vizier &#x27;Īsa ibn Nestorius (who was executed shortly after) and appoint their leader Ibn Ammar to head the government, with the title of &quot;wāsiṭa&quot; (&quot;intermediary&quot;) rather than full vizier. At the time the office of &quot;sifāra&quot; &quot;secretary of state&quot; was also combined within that office. Ibn &#x27;Ammar then took the title of &quot;Amīn ad-Dawla&quot; &quot;the one trusted in the empire&quot;. This was the first time that the term &quot;empire&quot; was associated with the Fatimid state. Ibn Ammar&#x27;s rule quickly descended into a Berber tyranny: he immediately began staffing the government with Berbers, who engaged in a virtual pillaging of the state coffers. The Berbers&#x27; attempts to exclude the other interest groups from power—not only the Turks and the other ethnic contingents of the army, but also the civilian bureaucracy, whose salary was cut—alienated not only the &quot;Mashāriqa&quot;, but alarmed Barjawan as well. Barjawan contacted the Fatimid governor of Damascus, the Turk Manjutakin, and invited him to march onto Egypt and depose Ibn Ammar. Manjutakin accepted, but was defeated by Ibn Ammar&#x27;s troops under Sulayman ibn Ja&#x27;far ibn Falah at Ascalon and taken prisoner. Barjawan however soon found a new ally, in the person of the Kutama leader Jaysh ibn Samsam, governor of Tripoli, whom Ibn Falah dismissed and replaced with his own brother. Jaysh and Barjawan gathered a following of other dissatisfied Berber leaders, and launched an uprising in Cairo in October 997. Ibn Ammar was forced to flee, and Barjawan replaced him as &quot;wāsiṭa&quot;.

During his predominance, Barjawan managed to balance the two factions, fulfilling the demands of the &quot;Mashāriqa&quot; while taking care of the Kutama as well. In this vein, he pardoned Ibn Ammar and restored him his monthly salary of 500 gold dinars. After Bajarwan&#x27;s murder on 26 March 1000, however, Caliph al-Hakim assumed the reins of government and launched a purge of the Fatimid elites, during which Ibn Ammar and many of the other Kutama leaders were executed. To ensure his own power, Hakim limited the authority and terms of office of his wasitas and viziers, of whom there were more than 15 during the remaining 20 years of his caliphate.

===External rivals &amp; House of Knowledge===

Al-Hakim&#x27;s most rigorous and consistent opponent was the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, which sought to halt the influence of Ismailism. This competition led to the Baghdad Manifesto of 1011, in which the Abbāsids claimed that the line al-Ḥākim represented did not legitimately descend from &#x27;Alī. His diplomatic and missionary vehicle was the Ismā&#x27;īlī &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot; &quot;Mission&quot;, with its organizational power center in Cairo.

He founded the House of knowledge in 1004AD which competed with Baghdad’s House of Wisdom and eventually surpassed it, becoming the number 1 in the world.

===Internal unrest and groups===
Al-Hakim&#x27;s reign was characterized by a general unrest. The Fatimid army was troubled by a rivalry between two opposing factions, the Turks and the Berbers. Tension grew between the Caliph and his viziers (called &quot;wasīta&quot;s), and near the end of his reign, the Druze movement, a religious sect that deified al-Hakim as God manifest, began to form. Members of that sect were reported to address prayers to al-Hakim, whom they regarded as &quot;a manifestation of God in His unity.&quot;

===The Baghdad Manifesto===
Alarmed by the expansion of the Fatimid dominion, the &#x27;Abbasid caliph al-Qadir of Baghdad adopted retaliatory measures to halt the spread of Ismailism within the very seat of his realm. In particular, in 1011 he assembled a number of Sunni and Twelver Shiite scholars at his court and commanded them to declare in a written document that Hakim and his predecessors lacked genuine descent from Ali and Fatima. This so-called Baghdad Manifesto was read out in Friday mosques throughout the &#x27;Abbasid domains accusing the Fatimids of Jewish ancestry. In addition, because of al-Hakim&#x27;s alleged Christian mother, he was accused of being over-sympathetic to non-Muslims, giving them more privileges than they should have been given under Islamic rule. Such accusations were manifested through poetry criticizing the Fatimids. Qadir also commissioned several refutations of Ismaili doctrines, including those written by the Mu&#x27;tazili &#x27;Ali b. Sa&#x27;id al-Istakri (1013).

===Foreign affairs===
Hakim confronted numerous difficulties and uprisings during his relatively long reign. While he did not lose any important territories in North Africa, the Ismaili communities there were attacked by Sunni fighters led by their influential Maliki jurists. Relations between the Fatimids and the Qarmatians also remained hostile. On the other hand, Hakim&#x27;s Syrian policy was successful as he managed to extend Fatimid hegemony to the emirate of Aleppo.

Al-Hakim upheld diplomatic relations between the Fatimid Empire and many different countries. Skillful diplomacy was needed in establishing friendly, or at least neutral relations with the Byzantine Empire, which had expansionary goals in the early 11th century.

The geographically farthest-reaching diplomatic mission of al-Hakim was to Song dynasty China. The Fatimid Egyptian sea captain known as Domiyat traveled to a Buddhist pilgrimage site in Shandong in AD 1008. It was on this mission that he sought to present to the Chinese emperor Zhenzong of Song gifts from his ruling Caliph, al-Hakim. This reestablished diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907.

===Disappearance and succession ===
In the final years of his reign, al-Hakim displayed a growing inclination toward asceticism and withdrew for meditation regularly. On the night of 12/13 February 1021 at the age of 35, al-Hakim left for one of his regular nocturnal meditation journeys to the Mokattam hills on the outskirts of Cairo but failed to return. A search found only his horse and bloodstained garments. His disappearance has remained a mystery.

Modern historians have assessed whether al-Hakim&#x27;s sister Sitt al-Mulk may have had a hand in his disappearance, but no historic evidence has emerged that would implicate her. Al-Mulk would lead moves to declare her nephew al-Zahir li-I&#x27;zaz Din Allah as his father&#x27;s successor as imam-caliph. The heir al-Hakim had designated was removed from court and al-Mulk was appointed regent for her 16-year-old nephew. After al-Zahir came of age, al-Mulk assumed positions within his administration until her death in 1023.

==Sobriquet in Western literature==
In Western literature he has been referred to as the &quot;Mad Caliph&quot;. This title is largely due to his erratic and oppressive behavior concerning religious minorities under his command, as historian Hunt Janin relates: al-Hakim &quot;was known as the &#x27;Mad Caliph&#x27; because of his many cruelties and eccentricities&quot;; his persecution of Christians is seen as a contributing factor to the Crusades, as he not only forbade pilgrimage to the Holy Land but also ordered the demolition of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem in 1009. The church was reconstructed by his son and successor al-Zahir, with historian Michael Bonner pointing out that the term is also used due to the dramatic difference between al-Hakim and his predecessors and successors and also points out that such persecution is an extreme rarity in Islam during this era. &quot;In his capital of Cairo, this unbalanced (and, in the view of most, mad) caliph raged against the Christians in particular... On the whole such episodes remained exceptional, like the episodes of forced conversion to Islam.&quot; Historian Michael Foss also notes this contrast: &quot;For more than three hundred and fifty years, from the time when the Caliph Omar made a treaty with the Patriarch Sophronius until 1009, when mad al-Hakim began attacks on Christians and Jews, the city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land were open to the West, with an easy welcome and the way there was no more dangerous than a journey from Paris to Rome... Soon [after al-Hakim] the panic was over. In 1037 al-Mustansir came to an amicable agreement with Emperor Michael IV.&quot;

As one prominent journal has noted, al-Hakim has attracted the interest of modern historians more than any other member of the Fatimid dynasty because: 

The claim that al-Hakim was mad and the version of events around him is disputed as mere propaganda by some scholars, such as Willi Frischaue, who states: &quot;His enemies called him the &#x27;Mad Caliph&#x27; but he enhanced Cairo&#x27;s reputation as a centre of civilization.&quot; The writing of historian Heinz Halm attempts to dispel &quot;those distorted and hostile accounts, stating that the anti-Fatimid tradition tried to make a real monster of this caliph&quot;, while P.J. Vatikiotis writes that, &quot;[al-Hakim&#x27;s] persecution of Christians and Jews and the legislation enacted for that purpose between 1004 and 1020 seem to have been a policy with a justifiable purpose.&quot;

==al-Hakim and Ismailism==

Al-Hakim maintained a keen interest in the organization and operation of the Fatimid Ismaili da&#x27;wa (preaching) centred in Cairo. Under his reign it was systematically intensified outside the Fatimid dominions, especially in Iraq and Persia. In Iraq, the da&#x27;is now concentrated their efforts on a number of local amirs and influential tribal chiefs with whose support they aimed to uproot the Abbasids. Foremost among the Fatimid da&#x27;is of this period operating in the eastern provinces was Hamid al-Din Kirmani, the most accomplished Ismaili theologian-philosopher of the entire Fatimid period. The activities of Kirmani and other da&#x27;is soon led to concrete results in Iraq: in 1010 the ruler of Mosul, Kufa and other towns acknowledged the suzerainty of Hakim. The 16th Fatimid imam, caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (996–1021) ordered his da&#x27;i, Harun ibn Muhammad in Yemen, to give decisions in light of Da&#x27;a&#x27;im al-Islam only.

In 1013 he completed the construction of al-Jāmiʻ al-Anwar begun by his father. Commonly known as &quot;Hākim&#x27;s Mosque&quot;, over time it fell into ruin. In the 1970s, the Dawoodi Bohras, an Ismaili Shia sect, under the leadership of Mohammed Burhanuddin, restored the then-dilapidated mosque, using new building methods and materials while maintaining as many of the architectural and artistic features as possible. Their attempts received strong criticism from some academics, conservators, and art historians who saw the effort as constructing &quot;a new building&quot; rather than restoration.

===House of Knowledge===

In the area of education and learning, one of Hakim&#x27;s most important contributions was the founding in 1005 of the &quot;Dār al-ʿIlm&quot; (House of Knowledge) in Cairo. A wide range of subjects ranging from the Qur&#x27;an and hadith to philosophy and astronomy were taught at the Dār al-ʿIlm, which was equipped with a vast library. During his rule, al-Hakim provided paper, ink, pens and inkstands free of charge to all those who studied there. Access to education was made available to the public and many Fatimid da&#x27;is received at least part of their training in this major institution of learning which served the Ismaili da&#x27;wa (mission) until the downfall of the Fatimid dynasty.
For more than 100 years, Dār al-ʿIlm distinguished itself as a center of learning where astronomers, mathematicians, grammarians, logicians, physicians, philologists, jurists and others conducted research, gave lectures and collaborated. All were welcomed, and it remained unfettered by political pressures or partisan influences.

===Sessions of Wisdom===
Hakim made the education of the Ismailis and the Fatimid &quot;da&#x27;i&quot;s a priority; in his time various study sessions (&quot;majalis&quot;) were established in Cairo. Hakim provided financial support and endowments for these educational activities. The private &#x27;wisdom sessions&#x27; (&quot;majalis al-hikma&quot;) devoted to esoteric Ismaili doctrines and reserved exclusively for initiates, now became organized so as to be accessible to different categories of participants. Al-Hakim himself often attended these sessions which were held at the Fatimid palace. The name &quot;majalis al-hikma&quot; is still used by the Druze, Nizari and Taiyabi Ismailis as the name of the building in which their religious assembly and worship is carried, often abbreviated as Majlis (session).

He would allow women to attend the house of knowledge to study so they could teach other women and their children, learning a wide range of subjects from Islam to philosophy.

===Druze===

Al-Hakim is a central figure in the history of the Druze religious sect, whose eponymous founder ad-Darazi proclaimed him as the incarnation of God in 1018. Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts, he proclaimed that God had become human and taken the form of man, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.

==Interreligious relationships==
According to the religious scholar Nissim Dana, al-Hakim&#x27;s relationship with other monotheistic religions can be divided into three separate stages.

===First period===
From 996 to 1006 when most of the executive functions of the Khalif were performed by his advisors, the Shiite al-Hakim &quot;behaved like the Shiite khalifs, who he succeeded, exhibiting a hostile attitude with respect to Sunni Muslims, whereas the attitude toward &#x27;People of the Book&#x27; – Jews and Christians – was one of relative tolerance, in exchange for the jizya tax.&quot;

In 1005, al-Hakim ordered a public posting of curses against the first three Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman) and against Aisha, wife of Muhammad, for denying the caliphate to Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law ʿAlī, who according to Shia beliefs, was the rightful prophetic successor.

According to historian Nissîm Dānā, al-Hakim ordered that &quot;curses were registered against the warrior Muawiyah I, founder of the Umayyad Caliphate, and against others in the inner circle of Muhammad from the Sahabah - the compatriots of Muhammad in the way of Islam.&quot; This was in accordance with Shia practice, as laid out by Muslim scholar Ayatollah Haydari: &quot;the followers of Ahl al-Bayt [Shias] say &#x27;O Allah curse all of the Banu Umayya&#x27;.&quot; The Shia maintain that out of hatred for ʿAlī, Muʿawiyah ordered the Talbiyah not be said (as it was promoted by ʿAlī) and ordered people to curse him (Saʿd ibn Abi Waqqas refused to do so). The Shia hold that Muʿawiyah and all of the Umayyad caliphs (with the possible exception of Umar II) were Nasibi who &quot;are the hypocrites for whom hatred of ʿAlī is their religion...They don&#x27;t just hate ʿAlī, but they worship Allah and seek closeness to Him by hating ʿAlī.&quot;

After only two years of posting the curses, al-Hakim ended the practice. During this era, al-Hakim ordered that the inclusion of the phrase &quot;as-salāh khayr min an-nawm&quot; &quot;prayer is preferable to sleep&quot;, which followed fajr prayer, be stopped – he saw it as a Sunni addition. In its place he ordered that &quot;ḥayyi ʿalā khayr al-ʿamal&quot; &quot;come to the best of deeds&quot; should be said after the summons was made. He further forbade the use of two prayers – &quot;Salāt at-Tarāwih&quot; and &quot;Salāt ad-Duha&quot; as they were believed to have been formulated by Sunni sages.

====Religious minorities====
In 1004 al-Hakim decreed that the Christians could no longer celebrate Epiphany or Easter. He also outlawed the use of wine (&quot;nabidh&quot;) and even other intoxicating drinks not made from grapes (&quot;fuqa&quot;) to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This produced a hardship for both Christians (who used wine in their religious rites) and Jews (who used it in their religious festivals).

In 1005, al-Hakim ordered that Jews and Christians follow &quot;ghiyār&quot; &quot;the law of differentiation&quot; – in this case, the &quot;mintaq&quot; or &quot;zunnar&quot; &quot;belt&quot; (Greek ζωνάριον) and &quot;imāmah&quot; &quot;turban&quot;, both in black. In addition, Jews must wear a wooden calf necklace and Christians a heavy iron cross. In the public baths, Jews must replace the calf with a bell. In addition, women of the People of the Book had to wear two different coloured shoes, one red and one black. These remained in place until 1014 and were thematised and protested by the Arab Christian poet Sulayman al-Ghazzi in his diwan.

Following contemporary Shiite thinking, during this period al-Hakim also issued many other restrictive ordinances (&quot;sijillat&quot;). These &quot;sijillat&quot; included outlawing entrance to a public bath with uncovered loins, forbidding women from appearing in public with their faces uncovered, and closing many clubs and places of entertainment.

===Second period===
From 1007 to 1012 &quot;there was a notably tolerant attitude toward the Sunnis and less zeal for Shiite Islam, while the attitude with regard to the &#x27;People of the Book&#x27; was hostile.&quot; On 18 October 1009, al-Hakim ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre and its associated buildings, apparently outraged by what he regarded as the fraud practiced by the monks in the &quot;miraculous&quot; Descent of the Holy Fire, celebrated annually at the church during the Easter Vigil. The chronicler Yahia noted that &quot;only those things that were too difficult to demolish were spared.&quot; Processions were prohibited, and a few years later all of the convents and churches in Palestine were said to have been destroyed or confiscated. It was only in 1042 that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX undertook to reconstruct the Holy Sepulchre with the permission of al-Hakim&#x27;s successor.

===Third period===
Al-Hakim ultimately allowed the unwilling Christian and Jewish converts to Islam to return to their faith and rebuild their ruined houses of worship. Indeed, from 1012 to 1021 al-Hakim 

While it is clear that Hamza ibn Ali was the Caliph&#x27;s chief &quot;dāʿī&quot;, there are claims that al-Hakim believed in his own divinity. Other scholars disagree with this assertion of direct divinity, particularly the Druze themselves, noting that its proponent was ad-Darazi, who (according to some resources) al-Hakim executed for &quot;shirk&quot;. Letters show that ad-Darazi was trying to gain control of the &quot;Muwahhidun&quot; movement and this claim was an attempt to gain support from the Caliph, who instead found it heretical.

==Consort and issue==
The mother of al-Hakim&#x27;s heir &#x27;Alī al-Zāhir was the &quot;umm al-walad&quot; Amīna Ruqayya, daughter to the late prince Abd Allah, son of al-Mu&#x27;izz. Some see her as the same as the woman in the prediction reported by al-Hamidi which held &quot;that in 390/1000 al-Hakim would choose an orphan girl of good stock brought up [by?] his father al-Aziz and that she would become the mother of his successor.&quot; While the chronicler al-Maqrizi claims that al-Hakim&#x27;s stepsister Sitt al-Mulk was hostile to Amīna, other sources say she gave her and her child refuge when they were fleeing al-Hakim&#x27;s persecution. Some sources say al-Hakim married the &quot;jariya&quot; (young female servant) known by the title as-Sayyidah but historians are unsure if this is just another name for Amīna.

Besides al-Zahir, al-Hakim had a daughter named Sitt Misr (d. 455/1063) who was said to be a princess of generous patronage and a noble character.

==In literature==
The story of al-Hakim&#x27;s life inspired (presumably through Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy) the French author Gérard de Nerval (1808–1855) who recounted his version of it (&quot;Histoire du Calife Hakem&quot;: &quot;History of the Caliph Hakem&quot;) as an appendix to his &quot;Voyage to the Orient&quot; (1851).

He is a major character in &quot;The Prisoner of Al-Hakim&quot; by American novelist Bradley Steffens, which recounts the ten-year imprisonment of Ibn al-Haytham under al-Hakim&#x27;s rule.

A fictional version of al-Hakim is presented in Robert E. Howard&#x27;s posthumously published short story &quot;Hawks over Egypt&quot;.

The novel &quot;The Sleeper in the Sands&quot; by the English author and popular historian Tom Holland contains another fictional adaptation of the figure of al-Hakim.

<doc id="482945" wikidata="Q5093275" url="?curid=482945" title="Chesney and Wolfe">
<text>Chesney and Wolfe, were a British television comedy screenwriting duo consisting of Ronald Chesney (born René Lucien Cadier; 4 May 1920 – 12 April 2018) and Ronald Wolfe (born Harvey Ronald Wolfe-Luberoff; 8 August 1922 – 18 December 2011). They were best known for their sitcoms &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; (1961–1963, 1977–1978), &quot;Meet the Wife&quot; (1963–1966), &quot;On the Buses&quot; (1969–1973) and &quot;Romany Jones&quot; (1972–1975). When their partnership began in the mid-1950s, Chesney was already known to the public as a harmonica player.

==Early life==
===Ronald Chesney===
Chesney, was born in London of French descent, the son of Marius, a silk trader, and Jeanne (&quot;née&quot; Basset). He left the French Lycée school in London at the age of 16, and began using his English name.

Chesney initially learned piano, but decided instead a career as a chromatic harmonica player, performing professionally from the age of 17. Touring the ABC Cinema chain, he played on BBC Radio broadcasts from 1937, the first being &quot;Palace of Varieties&quot;. Declared unfit to serve in the Second World War because of the removal of a tuberculosis-infected kidney, he taught the harmonica to troops in a BBC radio series, which ran for 42 weeks, beginning in 1940. After the war, he began to diversify into the classical repertoire.

Chesney became a well-known performer, entertaining troops, performing at the London Palladium and Royal Albert Hall, and working with Duke Ellington and Gracie Fields. He was President of the National Hohner Song Band League (later the National Harmonica League) from 1951.

===Ronald Wolfe===
Wolfe was born in London, a cousin of actor Warren Mitchell, and the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants. His parents ran a kosher restaurant in Whitechapel, which served performers from the variety theatre across the road. He was educated at the Central Foundation Boys&#x27; Grammar School in Islington. For a while he was a stand-up comedian. &quot;I came from vaudeville and music halls&quot;, he once said. During the Second World War, he was an army radio operator, and after being demobbed he worked as a radio engineer for Marconi.

In the early 1950s, he began to write for the Jewish comedian Max Bacon; after Bacon introduced him to the BBC, Wolfe contributed material for radio shows. &quot;Starlight Hour&quot; (1951), broadcast on the BBC Light Programme, was a series which featured Beryl Reid. Wolfe became Reid&#x27;s regular writer, providing material for her characters, Brummie Marlene and the naughty schoolgirl, Monica. After Reid joined the cast of the radio comedy series &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, Wolfe joined the writing team for the series which Eric Sykes had created. The series featured ventriloquist Peter Brough and his dummy Archie Andrews.

==Chesney and Wolfe&#x27;s projects==
===Early collaborations===
Chesney&#x27;s harmonica playing was featured as a musical interlude on &quot;Educating Archie&quot;; this led to his first meeting with Wolfe in 1955. They wrote the show&#x27;s last four seasons, initially with another of the show&#x27;s writers, Marty Feldman. A one-off special for BBC Television in 1956, entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s Archie&quot;, was written by Wolfe, but still featured Chesney with his harmonica act. It also starred Irene Handl.

The first regular television work for Chesney and Wolfe, writing in partnership with Feldman, was in 1958 when ITV franchise holder Associated-Rediffusion made a television version of &quot;Educating Archie&quot;. Persuaded by Wolfe, Chesney soon gave up performing professionally, so that they could form a writing partnership. He did, however, tutor Sylvia Syms for her harmonica-playing role in the film &quot;No Trees in the Street&quot; (1959). By this time, they had also written material for Tommy Steele and Ken Dodd, including pantomimes for both. The sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s A Deal&quot; (1961) turned out to be their last work for radio. It starred Sid James as a dishonest property developer, with Dennis Price as his partner, but lasted for only a single series of 13 episodes.

===&quot;The Rag Trade&quot;===
Around the same time, the two men created &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; (1961–63), starring Peter Jones as Harold Fenner, ungenerous head of Fenner Fashions, Miriam Karlin as the shop steward, Paddy, and Reg Varney as the foreman trying to mediate the conflict between employer and employed in a London East End sweat-shop. Sheila Hancock and Barbara Windsor were also in the cast, plus the diminutive Esma Cannon. Directed (and produced) by Dennis Main Wilson, Karlin wrote in her autobiography that Main Wilson had an &quot;amazing capacity for picking the right people&quot; for a cast.

Rejected by Associated-Rediffusion, who thought factory workers would not watch it, the pitch was picked up by Frank Muir and Denis Norden who were then comedy advisers for BBC Television. Unusually for the time, the series featured strong female roles, who it has been said gained the best lines, and it was a popular and critical success, being watched by more than 11 million viewers. Karlin&#x27;s chain-smoking character had the catchphrase &quot;Everybody out!&quot; &quot;I know all about working people and the struggles of the small businessman,&quot; Ronald Wolfe once said. &quot;Writers who come from orthodox middle-class backgrounds can’t write &quot;The Rag Trade&quot;-type show. They just don’t know what makes the man in the street laugh.&quot; The show was turned into a stage version which had a run in London&#x27;s West End at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1962.

===Later 1960s shows===
Chesney and Wolfe repeated their success with the BBC sitcom &quot;Meet the Wife&quot; (1964–66) starring Thora Hird and Freddie Frinton. It was originally a one-off &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; pilot called &quot;The Bed&quot; (1963). Again, this featured working class characters and humour. Frinton&#x27;s character was a plumber, while Hird&#x27;s had social aspirations. It ran for five series. In 1964, for Australian television, they wrote the first six episodes of a 13 episode comedy series, &quot;Barley Charlie&quot;, concerning the inheritance by two sisters of a run down garage with one lazy employee.

The partnership wrote &quot;The Bed-Sit Girl&quot; (1965–66) for Sheila Hancock, who played a young typist frustrated by her current life. One of the series&#x27; characters, a neighbour (played by Derek Nimmo) of Hancock&#x27;s title character, carried over to a follow-up series: &quot;Sorry I&#x27;m Single&quot; (1967) starred Nimmo as a callow mature student sharing a house with three young women. &quot;Wild, Wild Women&quot; (1969), starring Barbara Windsor and Pat Coombs and set in 1902, was effectively a period-drama variation on &quot;The Rag Trade&quot;, but only one series was produced.

===&quot;On the Buses&quot;===
Their next series was ITV&#x27;s &quot;On the Buses&quot;, which ran from 1969 to 1973, leading them to be called the Other Two Ronnies. Rejected by the BBC, it was commissioned by Frank Muir, now Head of Entertainment at the then recently established London Weekend Television, who said it was &quot;rather at the baked beans end of my menu&quot;. The series had an audience of up to 20 million, and was more popular at the time than &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

It starred Reg Varney as bus driver Stan Butler, with Bob Grant as his bus conductor Jack Harper. Doris Hare was his Mum (originally played by Cicely Courtneidge), Michael Robbins his brother-in-law Arthur, Anna Karen as his plain sister Olive. Stephen Lewis as bus inspector Cyril Blake, usually referred to as &#x27;Blakey&#x27;, delivered the series&#x27; catchphrases &quot;I &#x27;ate you, Butler&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll get you for this, Butler&quot;. Both Varney and Grant&#x27;s characters were womanisers. As David Stubbs wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, Grant and Varney were playing &quot;two conspicuously middle-aged men&quot; pursuing &quot;an endless array of improbably available &#x27;dolly birds&#x27;&quot;.

The series, although a rating success, was nevertheless critically derided at the time of its first broadcast. It led to three film spin-offs, which Chesney and Wolfe both co-wrote and co-produced. The first of these was more successful at the British box office than the year&#x27;s James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). &quot;On the Buses&quot; American remake, &quot;Lotsa Luck&quot; (1973–74), ran for a season on NBC. When &quot;On the Buses&quot; ended, Wolfe and Chesney followed it with &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (1974–75), which starred Stephen Lewis&#x27;s Blakey character abroad in Spain with his sister (played by Pat Coombs). It lasted for two series.

===Later work===
The ITV sitcom &quot;Romany Jones&quot; ran from 1973 to 1975, with an initial pilot in 1972, was set on a caravan site. Originally it starred &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; actor James Beck (who died in 1973, after recording the second series) with Jo Rowbottom and Jonathan Cecil also appearing. It lasted four series, being the most successful in the ratings of their series after &quot;On the Buses&quot;. It led to a sequel, featuring the characters played by Arthur Mullard and Queenie Watts moving into a council house, entitled &quot;Yus, My Dear&quot; (1976). The latter series, which had comparatively low ratings, has a reputation, shared with &quot;Romany Jones&quot;, of being one of the worst-ever sitcoms.

In 1977, following the BBC&#x27;s rejection of a new pilot episode, &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; was revived by LWT for the ITV network, with Peter Jones and Miriam Karlin returning; it lasted for two series. Anna Karen was &quot;transplanted&quot; into the cast (as Anthony Hayward expressed it in 2011) to play her Olive character from &quot;On The Buses&quot;. Karlin, however, encouraged to return to the role by a promise from Chesney and Wolfe of a more ethnically diverse cast, ultimately regretted her involvement, believing the sole black character was merely a token.

Their last two series as a comedy scriptwriting partnership were &quot;Watch This Space&quot; (BBC 1980) set in an advertising agency with Liza Goddard, Peter Blake and Christopher Biggins, and &quot;Take a Letter, Mr. Jones&quot; (Southern 1981), a role-reversal comedy created for John Inman, which also starred Rula Lenska.

An episode of &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; (1989) and &quot;Fredrikssons Fabrik – The Movie&quot; (1994) were the partnership&#x27;s last scripts.

==Later life==
From the 1980s, Wolfe taught comedy writing at London&#x27;s City University in 1986 and 1988. His text book &quot;Writing Comedy&quot; first appeared in 1992. He was also a contributor to &quot;The Stage&quot; newspaper. &quot;Ronnie Wolfe – My Life in Memoirs&quot; appeared in 2010. Written 20 years earlier, it was launched at BAFTA in November 2010. Chesney was no longer a regular harmonica player in his last years; he preferred to play jazz on his grand piano at home.

Wolfe died on Sunday 18 December 2011, aged 89, three days after sustaining head injuries from a fall at a care home in London. He had married Rose Krieger in 1953; she served as his secretary and estimated that she had typed 95% of his scripts. The couple had two daughters. &quot;He was the most incredible husband and we had 58 years of superb marriage harmony&quot;, his wife said in tribute.

Chesney died at Kingston Hospital on 12 April 2018, aged 97. He was survived by his wife Patricia, to whom he was married for 70 years, and their two children, Marianne and Michael.

<doc id="482949" wikidata="Q189823" url="?curid=482949" title="Haikou">
<text>Haikou is the capital and most populous city of the Chinese province of Hainan. Haikou city is situated on the northern coast of Hainan, by the mouth of the Nandu River. The northern part of the city is on the Haidian Island, which is separated from the main part of Haikou by the Haidian River, a branch of the Nandu. Administratively, Haikou is a prefecture-level city, comprising four districts, and covering . There are 2,046,189 inhabitants in the built-up area, all living within the four urban districts of the city.

Haikou was originally a port city, serving as the port for Qiongshan. During the Chinese Civil War, Haikou was one of the last Nationalist strongholds to be taken by the Communists — with the Battle of Hainan Island in 1950. Currently, more than half of the island&#x27;s total trade still goes through Haikou&#x27;s ports. The Temple of the Five Lords is located to the southeast of the city.

The city is home to Hainan University, a comprehensive research university under the Project 211 and the Double First Class University Plan in certain disciplines, which has its main campus on Haidian Island.

==History==
The hanzi characters comprising the city&#x27;s name, , mean &quot;ocean&quot;/&quot;sea&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot;/&quot;port&quot;, respectively. Thus, the name &quot;Haikou&quot; is also a word for &quot;seaport&quot; – similar to Portsmouth in Britain. Haikou originally served as the port for Qiongshan, the ancient administrative capital of Hainan island, located some inland to the south east. During its early history Haikou was a part of Guangdong province. In the 13th century it was fortified and became a military post under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The port is located west of the mouth of the Nandu River, Hainan&#x27;s principal river. When Qiongshan was opened to foreign trade under the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858, Haikou started to rival the old administrative city. It was formerly known internationally as &#x27;Hoihow&#x27;, based on the Cantonese pronunciation by the British Raj officers. In 1926, Haikou overtook Qiongshan in population and it was declared a separate administrative city.

The city and island of Hainan stayed under the control of the Nationalists until April 1950, when it fell to the Communists during the Landing Operation on Hainan Island.

Since 1949, Haikou has maintained its position as Hainan&#x27;s main port, handling more than half of the island&#x27;s total trade. It has replaced Qiongshan as the island&#x27;s administrative capital. In 1988, Haikou was made a prefecture-level city as well as the capital of the newly created Hainan Province.

Haikou old town contains a small portion of the oldest buildings in Haikou city that returnees from overseas built. The houses are a mixture of styles including Portuguese, French, and Southeast Asian. The streets used to be divided into different areas selling Chinese and western medicine, for silk and bespoke clothes, one for fresh fish and meat, and others for the sale of incense, candles, paper, ink, and other goods.

Various projects are currently under discussion to decide the best way to restore and preserve these historical buildings.

==Geography==

Haikou is situated on the north coast of Hainan Island, by Haikou Bay, facing the Leizhou Peninsula across the Qiongzhou Strait that stretches west from Beibu Bay near Vietnam to the James Shoal bordering the South China Sea to the west. Most of the city is almost completely flat and only a few metres above sea level. It has an area of . The Meishe River winds through the east side of the city flowing northward to the Haidian River.

The northern part of Haikou City, the district of Haidian Island, is separated from the main part of Haikou by the Haidian River, a tributary of the Nandu River. The district is accessed by one of four bridges, the largest being Haikou Century Bridge, which connects the Guomao district with Haidian Island at the estuary of the Haidian River. From east to west the remaining three road connections are provided by the Renmin, Heping and Xinbu Bridges.

Directly to the northeast of Haikou and to the east of Haidian Island is Xinbu Island.

==Climate==

Haikou is on the northern tropical zone, and is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. April to October is the active period for tropical storms and typhoons, most of which occur between August and September. May to October is the rainy season with the heaviest rainfall occurring in September. The city has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;). Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 12 January 1955 to on 30 April 2024.

===Environment===
, Haikou has the second best air quality among major cities nationally, preceded only by Lhasa, Tibet. However, since approximately 2009, due to an increase in the number of automobiles, there has been somewhat worsening air pollution.

According to the 2005 statistical book issued by the National Bureau of Statistics, Haikou scored the highest among China&#x27;s main cities in air quality, with 366 days (2004) of ambient air quality equal to or above grade II, with only 0.033 milligrams/m2 of particulate matter (the least of all main cities), 0.003 milligrams/m2 of sulphur dioxide (only Lhasa had less), and 0.013 milligrams/m2 of nitrogen dioxide (the least of all main cities).

In 1995, the Haikou city government began an initiative to improve the quality of life for its residents. With the approval of the World Health Organization, and Ministry of Health, a ten-point plan was undertaken to address such issues as:

*Community health care
*Vaccinations for children
*Waste recycling
*Green belts and urban trees
*Environmentally friendly construction
*Public toilets (These are available throughout the city, are staffed, and well maintained.)
*Sewage treatment
*Communications
*Noise pollution

The groundwater is of international standard, and is classified as mineral water.

By 2004, the city had established 43 new community health service centers reaching 85 percent of the population. The initiative has increased the size of Haikou&#x27;s green spaces to 2,000 hectares, with trees lining 40 percent of its roads. Noise pollution has dropped from 61.1db to 58.2db and 300 public toilets have been built. All industrial effluents, industrial waste water and solid waste, and all live sewage, is now processed through centralized treatment centers, and is disposed of without environmental impact. These improvements and others have increased life expectancy in Haikou to 78.26 years.

Haikou city has also built 163 model ecological villages. Now, over 200,000 villagers in 933 villages have tap water in their homes.

====Comprehensive city-improvement campaign====
During 2015 and 2016, large-scale city improvements have taken place as part of a province-wide initiative called &quot;double create&quot; (). It is described by government sources as a campaign to create a cleaner city and create a more civilized city. It is focused on traffic and commerce, but has also improved the overall appearance of the city, tackling air pollution from industry emissions, aiming to ensure the safety of drinking water sources, improving public security in such places as hospitals, schools, malls, and visitor attractions. Details of these improvements include:

*Traffic: Many new street crossings with traffic lights were installed around the city to improve two-wheel vehicles (consisting mainly of electric motorbikes) and pedestrian travel. Throughout the city, teams of police have been stationed at major intersections to ensure that two-wheel vehicles obey the law. Although there are many side lanes for these bikes, the actual pedestrian sidewalks serve as legal, one-way routes. Police at intersections stop vehicles either going the wrong way, or running red lights and the offenders may be forced to wear a red sash, stop other offenders, and lecture them.
*Commerce: Around August 2015, teams of officers physically removed nearly all illegal structures used for business in the city (a province-wide campaign) which were commonly made of corrugated metal or cinderblocks and were shop extensions or simply unused space that had been built upon. Street vendors were banned (most of whom sold vegetables or fruit), as was the night operation of roadside BBQ sites and the placement of tables onto the sidewalks by restaurants. These night time food operations were once common throughout the city.
*Roads and sidewalks: Many small roads have been repaved including narrow lanes in old neighbourhoods. Also, many sidewalks have been upgraded with new brick. Bricks are used as sidewalk material in Haikou because of the large amount of ficus trees, the roots of which deform the surrounding sidewalk.
*Demolition and reconstruction: A number of entire neighbourhoods within the city have been, and are being, entirely demolished with new buildings and roads being built.
*Starting around the beginning of 2018, the city government funded painting and cladding of a number of buildings in the city centre.

===Water and sewage treatment===
The treatment of Haikou&#x27;s wastewater, and the supply of tap water is operated by the French company Veolia Water. The partial privatization agreement gives 49 percent ownership to Veolia Water in a 30-year joint venture with Haikou Water Group (2012–2042).

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 Census, the prefecture-level city of Haikou has a registered population of 2,046,189 inhabitants, 537,848 more than the population declared on the past census in 2000. The average annual population growth during the period 2000–2010 was of 3.1 percent. 
Most of the population of Haikou are Han Chinese (around 97.75 percent, according to the 2010 Census).

==Subdivisions==

Haikou has an extensive urban bus service. Standard fare is 1 yuan, with no bus pass, ticket, or transfer system in place. Urban minibuses operated prior to 2009, but have since been phased-out. Taxi automobiles and electric motorbikes operate throughout the city. During 2009–2010, petrol-fueled motorbike taxis were banned and seized by police at numerous checkpoints within the city.

Haikou has experienced a substantial increase in cars since the early 2000s. Traffic on main streets, once light, is now similar to other major cities, with rush hour problems that have prompted the city to expand several main roads and build a new elevated road from the west end of Guoxing Avenue to new developments west of Holiday Beach.

Many main roads in the city have a side lane, separated by a median, for two-wheeled vehicles.

Physical barriers were installed on many of the main two-way streets throughout the city in order to separate opposing lanes. These were installed for safety reasons to prevent pedestrians from crossing the streets at locations other than intersections.

Roundabouts are not prevalent in Haikou, being used mainly on Hai Xiu road, and a few other locations.

Traffic cameras are used at many main intersections in the city, with tickets being issued by post for traffic light infractions.

There is one tunnel in the city, the Qiaozhong Road Tunnel.

====Shared bicycles====

The Haikou Public Bicycle System has about 20,000 bicycles. A pre-paid swipe card system is used to gain access to them. Starting on January 24, 2017, privately run app-based &quot;dockless&quot; shared bikes came into service. By April, there were about 40,000 of these types of bikes available. Ofo, Mobike, and &quot;Quick to&quot; all cost 2 RMB per hour. Ofo and &quot;Quick to&quot; bikes have tires with tubes, meaning many are left around the city with flat tires. The Haikou Public Bicycle System has installed a number of new, more modern bikes with tires that cannot be punctured. Part of Mobike&#x27;s fleet also uses these types of tires.

===Air===
Haikou is served by Haikou Meilan International Airport (IATA: HAK, ICAO: ZJHK[1]), which is located from the city.

In January 2011, Haikou was selected to be the first test site for an experiment allowing private helicopter flight in China.

===Rail===

A railway links Haikou to the mainland. A ferry service transports the railway cars, along with other motor vehicles across the strait.

The Hainan East Ring Railway links Haikou and Sanya. There are 15 stations in between, either in operation or still under construction. Trains are designed to travel at . Travel time from Haikou to Sanya is approximately 1 hour and 22 minutes. The main station in Haikou is Haikou East railway station located near the southern end of Long Quan Road. In 2018, the Haikou South Station, the main bus station, relocated and is now directly to the south east of the Haikou East Railway Station.

In 2015, the Hainan western ring high-speed railway started operation. This second high-speed railway runs along the west coast of Hainan connecting with the Hainan Eastern Ring Railway.

Starting July 1, 2019, the Haikou Suburban Trains began operation. Up to 7 CRH6F-A (CRH6F with only 4 carriages) trains with specially-designed liveries will operate between Haikou station and Meilan station. The longest distance it will travel one-way is around 38 kilometers with 4 stations in between.

===Road===
Three main highways connect Haikou to other parts of Hainan, running east, west, and south through the middle of the province. The Haiwen expressway connects the city with Wenchang to the southeast. The main bus station is Haikou Transportation Center, located beside Haikou East railway station.

===Seaports===

Haikou has four seaports for passenger and cargo service. Haikou New Port, formerly known as the Inner Harbour, is located on the southern side of the mouth of the Haidian River. Approximately west of Haikou New Port is Haikou Xiuying Port. This port is considerably larger, and is the main distribution centre for cargo entering Hainan. It is also a major port for immigration onto Hainan Island. Around west of downtown Haikou are South Port and Haikou Port New Seaport.

==Arts and culture==

Several large public buildings now occupy Guoxing Avenue, the new area for arts and culture. These include 
the Hainan Provincial Museum, the Hainan Provincial Library, and the Hainan Centre for the Performing Arts. These are all located near to one another on the south side of the road, west of Haikou College of Economics, Haikou campus.

At the west side of Evergreen Park is the Haikou Great Hall of the People, a concert hall, and Hainan Exhibition &amp; Convention Center, a large centre for trade shows and other commercial events. Haikou City Stadium, is the main venue for sports events, and is located at the southeast corner of Evergreen Park.

The Wuyuan River Stadium opened in April 2018. It is located west of downtown Haikou, near the newly built Haikou West Coast. With a capacity of over 40,000, it is the largest stadium in the province.

Older cultural sites include the now-restored buildings of the Bo&#x27;ai Road area, the tomb of Hai Rui, Xiuying Fort in the Guomao area, the Temple of the Five Lords, the cemetery for the martyrs of Hainan&#x27;s Battle of the Liberation, and the former temple Haikou Yazhou Gu Cheng.

===Nightlife===
Bars and KTV are patronized until after midnight. There are several popular bar streets within the city. Up until 2015, roadside BBQ sites were common throughout the city. A large-scale campaign to clean up the city has since prohibited them.

==Tourism==

Also known as the &quot;Coconut city&quot;, Haikou is an important tourist destination for China. The city received 4.11 million tourists in 2002, up 7.99 percent from 2001. In 2019, the number of tourists in Haikou has exceeded 83.11 million. The city earned approximately three billion yuan (361 million US dollars) from the tourism industry during that period, up 11 percent from the previous year.

Haikou is also developing its Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibitions industry. The local government set up the Haikou Convention and Exhibition Bureau in June 2012 and pledged RMB35 million (US$5.6 million) to support the development of the MICE industry. More international hotel chains are also arriving. By 2013, international brands included Shangri-La, Westin (opening September 2013), and Sheraton.

In 2016, the China Merchants holdings group unveiled its plans to develop Shenzhen, Haikou and Sanya as the three destination ports that its South China Sea passenger cruises would serve. Subsequently, a large passenger cruise terminal was inaugurated in Shenzhen in October 2016.

<doc id="482952" wikidata="Q1357187" url="?curid=482952" title="Frequency mixer">
<text>In electronics, a mixer, or frequency mixer, is an electrical circuit that creates new frequencies from two signals applied to it. In its most common application, two signals are applied to a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum and difference of the original frequencies. Other frequency components may also be produced in a practical frequency mixer.

Mixers are widely used to shift signals from one frequency range to another, a process known as heterodyning, for convenience in transmission or further signal processing. For example, a key component of a superheterodyne receiver is a mixer used to move received signals to a common intermediate frequency. Frequency mixers are also used to modulate a carrier signal in radio transmitters.

== Types ==
The essential characteristic of a mixer is that it produces a component in its output which is the product of the two input signals. Both active and passive circuits can realize mixers. Passive mixers use one or more diodes and rely on their nonlinear current–voltage relationship to provide the multiplying element. In a passive mixer, the desired output signal is always of lower power than the input signals.

Active mixers use an amplifying device (such as a transistor or vacuum tube) that may increase the strength of the product signal. Active mixers improve isolation between the ports, but may have higher noise and more power consumption. An active mixer can be less tolerant of overload.

Mixers may be built of discrete components, may be part of integrated circuits, or can be delivered as hybrid modules.
Mixers may also be classified by their topology: 
* An &quot;unbalanced mixer,&quot; in addition to producing a product signal, allows both input signals to pass through and appear as components in the output. 
* A &quot;single balanced mixer&quot; is arranged with one of its inputs applied to a balanced (differential) circuit so that either the local oscillator (LO) or signal input (RF) is suppressed at the output, but not both. 
* A &quot;double balanced mixer&quot; has both its inputs applied to differential circuits, so that neither of the input signals and only the product signal appears at the output. Double balanced mixers are more complex and require higher drive levels than unbalanced and single balanced designs. 
Selection of a mixer type is a trade off for a particular application.

Mixer circuits are characterized by their properties such as conversion gain (or loss), noise figure and nonlinearity.

Nonlinear electronic components that are used as mixers include diodes and transistors biased near cutoff. Linear, time-varying devices, such as analog multipliers, provide superior performance, as it is only in true multipliers that the output amplitude is proportional to the input amplitude, as required for linear conversion. Ferromagnetic-core inductors driven into saturation have also been used. In nonlinear optics, crystals with nonlinear characteristics are used to mix two frequencies of laser light to create optical heterodynes.

=== Diode ===
A diode can be used to create a simple unbalanced mixer. The current formula_1 through an ideal semiconductor diode is primarily an exponential function of the voltage formula_2 across it is:
: formula_3
where formula_4 is the saturation current, formula_5 is the charge of an electron, formula_6 is the nonideality factor, formula_7 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_8 is the absolute temperature. The exponential can be expanded as the power series
: formula_9
The ellipsis represents all higher powers of the sum. Because higher powers fall off with formula_10, they can be assumed to be negligible for small signals, so an approximation using just the first three terms is:
: formula_11

Suppose that the sum of the two input signals formula_12 is applied to a diode, and that an output voltage is generated that is proportional to the current through the diode (perhaps by providing the voltage that is present across a resistor in series with the diode). Then, disregarding the constants in the diode equation, the output voltage will be proportional to:
: formula_13
In addition to the original two signals formula_14, this output voltage has formula_15, which when rewritten as formula_16 is revealed to contain the multiplication of the original two signals formula_17.

If two sinusoids of different frequencies are fed as input into the diode, such that formula_18 and formula_19, then the output formula_20 becomes:
: formula_21
Expanding the square term yields: 
: formula_22
According to the prosthaphaeresis product to sum identity formula_23, the product formula_24 can be expressed as the sum of two sinusoids at the sum and difference frequencies of formula_25 and formula_26: 
: formula_27
These new frequencies are &quot;in addition to&quot; the original frequencies of formula_28 and formula_29. A narrowband filter may be used to remove undesired frequencies from the output signal. 

=== Switching ===
Another form of mixer operates by switching, which is equivalent to multiplication of an input signal by a square wave. In a double-balanced mixer, the (smaller) input signal is alternately inverted or non inverted according to the phase of the local oscillator (LO). That is, the input signal is effectively multiplied by a square wave that alternates between +1 and -1 at the LO rate.

In a single-balanced switching mixer, the input signal is alternately passed or blocked. The input signal is thus effectively multiplied by a square wave that alternates between 0 and +1.
This results in frequency components of the input signal being present in the output together with the product, since the multiplying signal can be viewed as a square wave with a DC offset (i.e. a zero frequency component).

The aim of a switching mixer is to achieve the linear operation by means of hard switching, driven by the local oscillator. In the frequency domain, the switching mixer operation leads to the usual sum and difference frequencies, but also to further terms e.g. ±3&quot;f&quot;LO, ±5&quot;f&quot;LO, etc.
The advantage of a switching mixer is that it can achieve (with the same effort) a lower noise figure (NF) and larger conversion gain. This is because the switching diodes or transistors act either like a small resistor (switch closed) or large resistor (switch open), and in both cases only a minimal noise is added. From the circuit perspective, many multiplying mixers can be used as switching mixers, just by increasing the LO amplitude. So RF engineers simply talk about mixers, while they mean switching mixers.

== Applications ==

The mixer circuit can be used not only to shift the frequency of an input signal as in a receiver, but also as a product detector, modulator, phase detector or frequency multiplier. For example, a communications receiver might contain two mixer stages for conversion of the input signal to an intermediate frequency and another mixer employed as a detector for demodulation of the signal.

<doc id="482954" wikidata="Q1856798" url="?curid=482954" title="Umpire (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the umpire is the person charged with officiating the game, including beginning and ending the game, enforcing the rules of the game and the grounds, making judgment calls on plays, and handling disciplinary actions. The term is often shortened to the colloquial form ump. They are also sometimes nicknamed blue due to the traditional color of the uniform worn by umpires. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the umpiring crew. The position is analogous to that of a referee in many other sports.

==Duties and positions==
In a game officiated by two or more umpires, the umpire in chief (usually the home plate umpire) is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls balls and strikes, calls fair balls, foul balls short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the batter or concerning baserunners near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces. If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.

In nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career. On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.

Other umpires are called base umpires and are commonly stationed near the bases. (&quot;Field umpire&quot; is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the base umpire. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the first-base umpire and the third umpire is called the third-base umpire, even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands. These two umpires also call checked swings, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a &quot;safe&quot; gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.

When four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the left-field and right-field umpires (or simply outfield umpires).

Outfield umpires are used in major events, such as the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and depending on the level, at parts of post-season playoffs. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires adding a left-field and right-field umpire, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA). Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.

===Crew chief===
The term &quot;umpire-in-chief&quot; is not to be confused with the crew chief, who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.

For example, on the Major League level, &quot;The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew&#x27;s compliance with the Office of the Commissioner&#x27;s rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark.&quot; Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the Official Baseball Rules have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief&#x27;s umpiring position during a specific game. Instant replay reviews, for example, will be reviewed with the crew chief and one other umpire (usually the umpire who made the call on the field, unless the call was made by the crew chief), with results announced by the crew chief. The crew chief acts analogous to the &quot;crew chief&quot; in basketball (as referenced in the NBA and FIBA rules) or the &quot;referee&quot; in American football.

Starting with the 2022 season, umpire crew chiefs are equipped with wireless microphones to be used when announcing replay challenges and the results of those challenges, similar to college and professional football and the National Hockey League.

===Judgment calls===

An umpire&#x27;s judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion. Since 2014, MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge. If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB. If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official. An independent study of umpire pitch-call accuracy over 11 seasons (2008–2018) released on April 8, 2019, by Mark T. Williams of Boston University concluded that over 20% of certain pitches were called incorrectly. For the 2018 season, home plate umpires made about 34,000 incorrect ball and strike calls, which is about 14 per game and 1.6 per inning.

In the early years of professional baseball, umpires were not engaged by the league but rather by agreement between the team captains. However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the 1999 labor dispute that led to the decertification of the Major League Umpires Association, there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed World Umpires Association (now known as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association) all umpires were placed on one roster and work in games in both leagues.

==Amateur umpiring==

An amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered professionals, while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the Little League Baseball official website, umpires should be volunteers.

There are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the Babe Ruth League are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.

For the Little League World Series, amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.

==High school umpiring==
In the United States, many (if not most) high schools sponsor a baseball team. Many high schools sponsor multiple baseball teams; for instance, &quot;varsity&quot; and &quot;junior varsity&quot; teams. During the 2017–18 academic year there were 16,513 high schools sponsoring at least one baseball team, and 488,859 students participated on a high school baseball team. Thus, high school baseball is one of the most popular levels of baseball in the United States. Unlike college athletics, there is no competitive national championship on the high school level. And, unlike college athletics, umpires on the high school level are not administered by a national organization (such as the NCAA). Rather, high school baseball is administered at the state level (usually by a statewide high school athletic association) and the qualifications for becoming and remaining a high school umpire are usually set by the entity overseeing high school baseball in each individual state. For example, the Florida High School Athletic Association sets forth minimum requirements for being a high school umpire in Florida. Many statewide high school athletic associations contract with multiple local umpire associations throughout their state in which the local associations agree to train and provide umpires for high school games in each association&#x27;s geographic area of the state in return for a &quot;booking fee&quot; being paid to the local associations by either the statewide high school association or by individual high schools. The local associations also promise to train their umpires to meet the state high school association&#x27;s minimum requirements for umpires. For example, in Florida the Jacksonville Umpires Association trains and provides umpires for high school games in the Jacksonville area.

The specific requirements for becoming a high school umpire vary from state-to-state. However, generally all states share the same basic minimum requirements. First, a person trying to become an umpire must usually register with both the state high school athletic association and their local umpire association. Upon registering, most states provide their umpires with a high school rulebook, casebook, and umpires&#x27; manual. Second, most states require all umpires to attend clinics and meetings. These clinics may focus on rules, umpire mechanics, or a combination of both. Third, most states also require an umpire to pass a rules exam. Finally, most states also require umpires to work a certain number of pre-season scrimmages prior to working regular season games. As an example of these requirements, Georgia has an &quot;officials accountability program&quot; which sets forth the specific requirements for its interscholastic officials (including the attendance at clinics and camps and the passing of an examination) which can be reviewed here.

Although high school baseball is administered at the state level, the various state high school athletic associations have voluntarily formed the National Federation of State High School Associations. Through the federation, most state athletic associations have agreed to use its rulebook. Thus, while high school baseball is administered on a state level, almost all state associations use the same unique baseball rulebook (and the associated casebook and umpire manual) written specifically for the high school level. As a result, if an individual umpire moves from one state to another state (s)he would likely be using the same rule set in his/her new state as was used in his/her former state. However, there are significant rule differences between the federation&#x27;s rulebook compared to Major League Baseball (MLB) and NCAA rules. Thus, individuals wanting to umpire on the high school level will have to learn a different set of rules than those they may be familiar with had they previously umpired in a youth league using the MLB or NCAA rulebooks.

Almost exclusively, high school umpires are paid on a per game basis. As they are not salaried, they are not paid if they do not actually umpire a game, although some states require the home school to pay the umpires&#x27; travel expenses if they show up to the game site and the game is called, regardless of whether or not it starts. The amount paid differs, often significantly, from state to state. Most high school games are officiated by a two-umpire crew. However, many states use three-umpire and four-umpire crews to officiate playoff games.

==Professional umpire training and career development==
Becoming a Major League Baseball umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7–10 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy or The Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School. The former is owned and operated by Minor League Baseball while the latter is run by former and current Major League and Minor League umpires. Both are located in Florida. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an Umpire Camp, run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a &quot;tool for success&quot; at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.

After five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD) evaluation course also held in Florida. Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, &quot;is the entity which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion, retention, or release of all umpires in the Minor League Baseball system throughout the United States and Canada.&quot; The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by MiLBUD using input from the umpire schools. Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school&#x27;s graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by MiLBUD staff, some of whom are also instructors at the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy. The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level minor league. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.

Professional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or Class &quot;A&quot; Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced &quot;A&quot;). Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season &quot;A&quot; league (for example, the New York–Penn League), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the Gulf Coast League). Since 2008, some umpires who attend the evaluation course, but are not offered jobs in professional baseball may be offered jobs in the Coastal Plain League (a summer wood bat league for collegiate players). During the season, umpires in the Coastal Plain League are evaluated by MiLBUD and they may earn a promotion to a Rookie professional league as a result of injuries or resignations by umpires at higher levels.
Throughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the MiLBUD staff. All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season. In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.

Generally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress &quot;up the ranks&quot; if he advances up one level of Class &quot;A&quot; ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a collective bargaining ploy.

When promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire&#x27;s evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the International or Pacific Coast League), have been required to umpire in the Arizona Fall League where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff. Additionally, top minor league prospects will also be sent to umpire in winter leagues (during Major League and Minor League baseball&#x27;s off-season) usually located in the Caribbean, Central America or South America.

In addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during spring training (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as &quot;fill-in&quot; umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).

Finally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball&#x27;s permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, MiLBUD estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.

, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 per diem for hotel and meals, plus first-class commercial airline tickets. Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season. Amounts vary based on the umpire&#x27;s classification and experience.

, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.

In December 2019, MLB and the Major League Baseball Umpires Association agreed in principle to a new five-year labor agreement running through 2024.

==Uniforms==
Umpires are often referred as &quot;Blue&quot; because of the traditional color of their uniforms. Standardized navy blue suits worn with white shirts and navy ties were adopted as umpire uniforms by the American Association. This semi-formal and business-like attire elevated the appearance of umpires above the clothing worn by players. The National League adopted the same uniform the following year, as did the American League when it became a major league in 1901. Minor leagues likewise followed suit. For many decades there were no difference between the umpire uniforms of the two major leagues except that National League umpires adopted an inside chest protector worn under their suits while American League umpires wore an outside (or &quot;balloon&quot;) protector over their suits when calling balls and strikes at home plate.

In 1968, American League umpires began to wear grey trousers with their blue coats, while National League umpires retained the solid blue suits. That season, AL umpires were also allowed to work both behind the plate and on the bases wearing a long-sleeved light blue shirt with a tie but without the blazer.

In 1970, the National League added a league logo patch to the chest pocket and the umpire&#x27;s number on the right sleeve of the coat. That same year, the NL also introduced a short-sleeved light blue shirt worn without coat or tie for hot summer games; the American League also adopted the short sleeve variant in 1971. The next season, the AL introduced its current logo and was worn on the pocket of the shirts and blazers. 

In 1973, the AL switched to a maroon blazer worn with blue pants, which was used until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats added the abbreviation &quot;AL&quot;. Beginning with the 1976 World Series, in cold weather umpires could replace the shirt and tie with a turtleneck sweater (originally light blue for the NL and beige for the AL). In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires (the last umpire that used one, Jerry Neudecker, retired in 1985). The wearing of ties was phased out, with the 1979 All-Star Game being the last time they were worn.

In 1980, Major League Baseball standardized umpire uniforms for both leagues, adopting a uniform of a blue blazer, grey trousers, and short sleeved light blue shirt, with only the logo patch on the shirt and coat and the either &quot;AL&quot; or &quot;NL&quot; monogrammed caps differentiating them; the AL also added numbers to their umpire uniforms like the NL. Both leagues introduced V-neck sweaters for wear on the bases, with those AL umpires still using the outside chest protector also wearing them occasionally behind the plate. Late in the decade, windbreaker-style jackets and heavier coats similar to those worn by players in the dugouts were adopted as alternatives to the blazer when weather appropriate.

In 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs and red numbers on the sleeve. The simple monograms on the cap were replaced by a large red &quot;N&quot; with the NL logo and &quot;A&quot; with the AL logo respectively. The AL also permitted an optional red polo shirt (an homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that was not widely used; the notable exceptions were Derryl Cousins, Dale Scott and Durwood Merrill, who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore the navy blue shirts (Scott wore his red shirt behind the plate in Game 3 of the 1998 World Series; Cousins followed suit in the clinching Game 4 of the 1999 Series). The NL added a light blue polo shirt for warm weather in 1997 and was very popular, especially in the humid climates of Atlanta, Miami and St. Louis. Beginning in 2000, after the individual leagues&#x27; umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with &quot;MLB&quot; on the caps instead of the league designations. Only navy blue shirts were worn that season. 

During the 2000 postseason, the uniforms switched to black polo shirts with grey slacks, with the hats and chest patches now bearing the MLB logo. The light blue shirt was replaced by a gray shirt, but the blue returned a year later. Long-sleeve versions of the polo shirts are also available for colder weather, as is a short-sleeved turtleneck for use as an undershirt. Outerwear options consist of a black pullover windbreaker with removable lower sleeves and a heavier black dugout coat. Still available, though less commonly seen, is the &quot;plate coat&quot;, a modern version of the traditional blazer, also in black, which is typically only worn when serving as home plate umpire, where the large lower pockets are used for storing extra baseballs.

==Famous umpires==


===Hall of Fame===
The following ten umpires have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame:
* Class of 1953 – Tommy Connolly (NL, 1898–1900; AL, 1901–1931)
* Class of 1953 – Bill Klem (NL 1905–1941)
* Class of 1973 – Billy Evans (AL, 1906–1927)
* Class of 1974 – Jocko Conlan (NL 1941–1964)
* Class of 1976 – Cal Hubbard (AL, 1936–1951)
* Class of 1989 – Al Barlick (NL, 1940–1943, 1946–1955, 1958–1971)
* Class of 1992 – Bill McGowan (AL, 1925–1954)
* Class of 1999 – Nestor Chylak (AL, 1954–1978) 
* Class of 2010 – Doug Harvey (NL 1962–1992)
* Class of 2013 – Hank O&#x27;Day (NL, 1895, 1897–1911, 1913, 1915–1927)

Conlan and O&#x27;Day played in 128 and 232 major league games, respectively, prior to becoming professional umpires.

Several &quot;player&quot; inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include Hughie Jennings, Willie Keeler, King Kelly, and Chuck Klein. Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees Tim Keefe and Ed Walsh umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.

===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===

Like players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires&#x27; numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order (Al Barlick wearing number 1, Ken Burkhart number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire&#x27;s number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter an umpire&#x27;s number did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, Dave Pallone, Steve Fields, Fred Brocklander, and Lanny Harris were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 Gerry Davis was assigned number 12, previously worn by Andy Olsen, and in 1985 Tom Hallion was assigned number 20, previously worn by Ed Vargo.)

The American League&#x27;s number assignments were largely random. Bill Haller, the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the 1982 World Series, but the number was never reassigned.

In 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired Lou DiMuro&#x27;s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son Mike after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, Al Clark in the AL and Jerry Layne in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2001, Layne was able to obtain number 24. By comparison, Bruce Froemming was given #6 upon unification of the umpiring staffs since he had worn it longer in the NL than Jim Joyce had worn it in the AL; Joyce subsequently chose #66, unused by any previous umpire. When Froemming retired following the 2007 season, Joyce opted to keep #66, and #6 is now worn by Mark Carlson.) From 2020 to 2025, umpires (mainly call-up/reserve umpires used when the regular staff is on vacation) were assigned triple-digit numbers (100+).

From time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.

Since unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to Major League Baseball umpires, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the Major League Baseball policy instituted in 1997.
* 1 Bill Klem (NL, 1905–41); currently worn by Bruce Dreckman.
* 2 Nick Bremigan (AL, 1974–89); currently worn by Dan Bellino.
* 2 Jocko Conlan (NL, 1941–64); worn by Jerry Crawford during his tenure in the NL (1977–1999).
* 3 Al Barlick (NL, 1940–43, 1946–55, 1958–71); Later worn by Bill Welke and his brother Tim Welke, currently worn by Dan Merzel.
* 9 Bill Kunkel (AL, 1968–84); also a National Basketball Association referee. Later worn by Brian Gorman, currently worn by Alex MacKay.
* 10 John McSherry (NL, 1971–1996); died at home plate during the Cincinnati Reds-Montreal Expos season opener. Currently worn by Phil Cuzzi.
* 16 Lou DiMuro (AL, 1963–82); killed in an auto-related accident after a game in Arlington, Texas. Later worn by his son, Mike DiMuro and currently worn by Lance Barrett.
* 42 Jackie Robinson (retired by Major League Baseball since April 15, 1997.) Worn by Fieldin Culbreth in the American League through 1999; Culbreth switched to #25 when a unified umpiring staff was first used in 2000.

==Current MLB umpiring crews==
Below are the umpire crews for the 2025 MLB season. Crews frequently change over the course of the year as umpires are injured or on vacation.

Triple-A umpires who have officiated in the Arizona Fall League and were given a number are eligible to fill-in during the Major League Baseball regular season. They temporarily join crews that are missing members. Below are 2025 call-ups.

 




==Etymology==
According to the Middle English dictionary entry for noumpere, the predecessor of umpire came from the Old French nonper (from non, &quot;not&quot; and per, &quot;equal&quot;), meaning &quot;one who is requested to act as arbiter of a dispute between two people&quot;, or that the arbiter is not paired with anyone in the dispute.

In Middle English, the earliest form of this shows up as noumper around 1350, and the earliest version without the n shows up as owmpere, a variant spelling in Middle English, circa 1440.

The n was lost after it was written (in 1426–1427) as a noounpier with the a being the indefinite article. The leading n became attached to the article, changing it to an Oumper around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called false splitting. Thus today one says &quot;an umpire&quot; instead of &quot;a numpire&quot;.

The word was applied to the officials of many sports before baseball, including association football (where it has been superseded by &quot;referee&quot;) and cricket (which still uses it).

<doc id="482955" wikidata="Q2261203" url="?curid=482955" title="Prolonging the Magic">
<text>Prolonging the Magic is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Cake. It was released on October 6, 1998, on Capricorn Records. The sole successful single was &quot;Never There&quot;. The album was recorded after the departure of guitarist Greg Brown and features a rotating lineup of musicians to replace him. One of them, Xan McCurdy, became his full-time replacement.
On its opening week, &quot;Prolonging the Magic&quot; sold about 44,000 copies, debuting at No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. On 28 September 1999 the album was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments of one million copies.

The album was given a parental advisory sticker not because of profanity but for Satanic-themed lyrics. Some copies do not feature a sticker, with the only difference being that the song &quot;Satan Is My Motor&quot; has been retitled &quot;Motor&quot;.

The song &quot;Hem of Your Garment&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Allmusic wrote, &quot;Supposedly their attempt to make a smugness- and irony-free album, Cake&#x27;s third release does hold back the barbs a bit more than usual. And the strain shows. In these guys&#x27; hands, love songs without smirks and pop tunes straight up come out forced.&quot;

<text>The Komi ( also ) are a Permian ethnic group who are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit a region around the basins of the Vychegda, Pechora and Kama rivers in northeastern European Russia. They mostly reside in the Komi Republic, Perm Krai, Murmansk Oblast, Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug, and Nenets Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Federation.

==Name==
There have been at least three names for the Komi: &quot;Permyaks&quot;, &quot;Zyrians&quot; () and &quot;Komi&quot;.

The name Permyaks first appeared in Russian sources in the 10th century and came from the ancient name of the land between the Mezen and Pechora rivers– &quot;Perm&quot; or &quot;Great Perm&quot; (). Several origins of the name have been proposed but the most accepted is from Veps &quot;Peräma&quot; &quot;back, outer or far-away land&quot;. In Old Norse and Old English, it was known as &quot;Bjarmaland&quot; and &quot;Beormas&quot; respectively but those Germanic names designate a wider area than the Russian &quot;Perm&quot;, extending into the Arkhangelsk Oblast&quot;.&quot; 

Since the 20th century, the name has been applied only to the southern Komi (Komi-Permyaks) in the Perm Krai. In Russia, &quot;permyak&quot; also means &quot;an inhabitant of Perm or Perm Krai&quot;, regardless of ethnicity.

The name for the northern Komis – Zyryans – has a more contradictory origin. It exists since at least the 14th century and has many different forms in various Russian sources such as &quot;Seryan, Siryan, Syryan, Suryan&quot; and &quot;Ziryan, Ziranian, Zyryan&quot; (), but the latter finally became predominant. Turkin believed that it may come from a small tribe of the Komi (probably named &quot;saran&quot;) which was first met by the Russians, who used the name for all northern Komi. The neighbouring Uralic-speaking peoples use similar names for the Komi: Khanty &quot;sərän, sərån, săran, sārån&quot;, Mansi &quot;sarän&quot;, Nenets &quot;sānnğr, saran&quot;, Udmurt &quot;sara-kum&quot;.

The name Komi is the endonym for all subgroups of the people. It was first recorded by ethnographers in the 18th century. It originates from a Finno-Ugric word meaning &quot;man, human&quot;: Komi &quot;kom&quot;, Udmurt &quot;kum&quot;, Mansi &quot;kom, kum&quot;, Khanty &quot;xum&quot;, Selkup &quot;qum&quot;, Hungarian &quot;hím&quot; &quot;male&quot;. The theory that stated the word came from the name of the Kama River has been disproven, though some scholars like Paula Kokkonen favour this version.

== Subgroups and geographic distribution ==

The Komi are divided into two main groups, which are the Zyryans (northern Komi) and the Permyaks (southern Komi). These are divided into 8 subgroupings (9 if counting the almost completely russified Komi of the Upper Kama), which are further divided into even smaller subgroups. The Komi have been traditionally named after the rivers where they live: 
*Komi-Zyryans
**Komi-Izhma of the Izhma River (Komi: Изьватас, &quot;Iźvatas&quot;; Nenets: нысма, &quot;nysma&quot;)
***Komi of the Kola Peninsula
***Komi of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug
***Komi of the Lower Ob and Lyapin Rivers
**Komi of the Vashka and Mezen Rivers (Komi: Удораса, &quot;Udorasa&quot;)
**Komi of the Vym River (Komi: Емватас, &quot;Emvatas&quot;)
**Komi of the Pechora River (Komi: Печораса&quot;, Pećorasa&quot;)
**Komi of the Vychegda River (Komi: Эжватас, &quot;Ežvatas&quot;)
**Komi of the Sysola River (Komi: Сыктывсаяс, &quot;Syktyvsayas&quot;)
**Komi of the Letka and Luza Rivers (Komi: Лузса, &quot;Lusza&quot;)
*Komi-Permyaks 
**Komi of the Yazva River (Komi: Ёдзва, &quot;Yodzva&quot;&#x27;; Yazva: Пермякйӧз, &quot;Permyakyöz&quot;) 
**Komi of the Upper Kama River (nearly fully assimilated into Russians)
The majority of the Komi live in the Komi Republic as a separate national-administrative entity of the Russian Federation, numbering 256,000 as of the beginning of the 21st century, roughly 30% of the Republic&#x27;s population. About 60% (607,000) are Russians, about 6% (62,000) are Ukrainians, 1.5% (15,500) are Tatars, and 1.4% (15,000) are Belarusians. 

Most of the population of the Komi Republic resides in urban centres but a notable minority continues to live in villages. The Komi population in the countryside tends to be higher than that of Komi in urban areas, where ethnic Russians make up the majority of the population. Like the rest of the Finno-Ugric peoples of Russia, the population continues to steadily decrease - the 2010 census recorded only 228,235 people who indicated their nationality as &quot;Komi&quot;, as compared to the 336,309 recorded as Komi in the 1989 census.

==Language==

The Komi language belongs to the Permian branch of the Uralic family. There is limited mutual intelligibility with Udmurt. There are two main dialects: Zyrian in the Komi Republic and Permyak in the Komi-Permyak Okrug, which have been traditionally treated as separate languages. They are mutually intelligible, and can also be considered to form a single language with two regional language standards. The two separate standards were created in the early Soviet era partly because of the traditional administrative borders, and partly to hinder pan-Komi nationalistic aspirations. Until the 18th century, Komi was written in the Old Permic script (Komi: Важ Перым гижӧм, 𐍮𐍐‎𐍕 𐍟‎𐍔‎𐍠𐍨𐍜 𐍒‎𐍣‎𐍕𐍩𐍜‎, &quot;Važ Perym gižöm&quot;), also known as Anbur in reference in reference to its first 2 letters, which was created by Saint Stephen of Perm in the 14th century, seeing use up to the 16th century after which it saw use as a cryptographic writing system for Russian speakers.

Cyrillic was used from the 19th century and briefly replaced by the Latin alphabet between 1932 and 1936. The Komi language is currently written in Cyrillic, adding two extra letters - Іі and Ӧӧ - to represent vowel sounds which do not exist in Russian. The first book to be printed in Komi (a vaccination manual) appeared in 1815.

==History==
Based on linguistic reconstruction, the prehistoric Permians are assumed to have split into two peoples during the first millennium BC: the Komi and the Udmurts. By the 16th-17th centuries, the Komi further divided into the Komi-Permyaks (who remained in the Kama River basin) and the Komi-Zyryans (who migrated north).

From the 12th century the Russians began to expand into the Perm region and the Komi came into contact with Novgorod. Novgorodian traders travelled to the region in search of furs and animal hides. The Novgorodians referred to the southern Komi region as &quot;the Great Perm&quot;. Komi dukes unified the Great Perm with its centre at the stronghold of Cherdyn. As the Middle Ages progressed, Novgorod gave way to Moscow as the leading Russian power in the region. 

In 1365, Dmitry Donskoy, Prince of Moscow, gave Stephen of Perm the task of converting the region to Christianity. Stephen&#x27;s mission led to the creation of the eparchy of Perm in 1383. After his death, Stephen became the patron saint of the Komi. He also devised an alphabet for the Komi language. 

Some Komi resisted Christianisation, notably the shaman Pama. The Duke of Perm accepted baptism only in 1470 (he was given the Christian name Mikhail), possibly in an attempt to stave off Russian military pressure in the region. Mikhail&#x27;s conversion failed to stop an attack by Moscow which seized Cherdyn in 1472. Mikhail was allowed to keep his title of duke but was now a vassal of Moscow. The duchy survived only until 1505 when Mikhail&#x27;s son Matvei was replaced by a Russian governor and Komi independence came to an end.

In the 1500s, many Russian migrants began to move into the region, beginning a long process of colonisation and attempts at assimilating the Komis. Syktyvkar (&quot;Ust-Sysolsk&quot; before 1930) was founded as the chief Russian city in the region in the 18th century. The Russian government established penal settlements in the north for criminals and political prisoners. There were several Komi rebellions in protest against Russian rule and the influx of Slav settlers, especially after large numbers of freed serfs started arriving in the region in the 1860s. A national movement to revive Komi culture also emerged.

Russian rule in the area collapsed after World War I and the revolutions of 1917. In the subsequent Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks fought the Allies for control of the region. The Allied forces encouraged the Komi to set up their own independent state with the help of political prisoners freed from the local penal colonies. After the Allies withdrew in 1919, the Bolsheviks took over. They promoted Komi culture with the policy of &quot;korenizatsiya&quot;, but increased industrialisation damaged the Komi traditional way of life and the landscape of the republic. Stalin&#x27;s purges of the 1930s devastated the Komi intelligentsia, who were accused of &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot;. 

The remote and inhospitable region was also regarded as an ideal location for gulags. The influx of political prisoners and the rapid industrialisation of the region as a result of World War II left the Komi a minority in their own lands. Stalin carried out further purges of the Komi intellectual class in the 1940s and 1950s, and Komi language and culture were suppressed. Since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Komi have reasserted their claims to a separate identity.

== Culture ==

=== Architecture ===

The Komi settlements were set-up with large, multi-courtyard churchyards and villages, which were typically constructed along or close to a river. Since the Komi people inhabit territories densely covered with forests, the main material for the construction of houses and farm buildings has traditionally been wood. Komi dwellings in many respects resemble North Russian houses in their internal structure. 

2 major types of house types exist among the Komi, the Sysol house type (Сысольский тип) and the Vym house type (Bымский тип). The Sysol home is in a square-shaped, divided internally between a commercial section and the private section for its residents. The Vym house type is not very easy to distinguish from the Sysol home, its major differences lying in the windows and internal arrangement. The Izhma Komi, living in sparsely-wooded areas live in chum tents.
The efforts of Stephen of Perm to convert the Komi people to Orthodoxy had allowed the Komi to begin constructing and experimenting with church architecture, creating many churches with the tented-roof style similarly to the constructions happening in Northern Russia and Pomerania. While most churches in the territory of the republic were constructed with wood, select churches and monasteries featured stone construction. The republic had over 430 churches in 1917, but this number has fallen down to just 130, 31 of which are registered under heritage programs.

=== Clothing ===

The national dress of the Komi people is quite diverse and has numerous local variants. While men&#x27;s clothing had remained mostly similar throughout the territories inhabited by the Komi people (excluding the winter costumes of Komi males), women&#x27;s clothing has more variety, each region having its own distinct clothing type. These differences lie in the embroidery technique, type of fabrics and ornamentation. In general, the traditional clothing of the southern and central Komi closely resembles that of the Northern Russians and other Finno-Ugric groups, while the costume of the Izhma Komi has many common features with the Nenets.

=== Cuisine ===

Hunting, gathering and fishing have long been the main source of food for the Komi people, displayed through the dominance of meat, fish, berries and mushrooms in most Komi diets. Meat dishes were more common in the diet of the northern Komi, while dishes utilizing berries were more common in the south. Popular dishes of Komi cuisine are grain pies with fish, various porridges, Serbanka, other sour soups, cold soups based on bread, kvass, etc. The popular Russian dumpling dish &quot;pelmeni&quot; likely has its origins in the cuisine of the Komi and Udmurt peoples, its name (пельнянь, &quot;pel&#x27;n&#x27;an&quot;&#x27;) meaning &quot;ear bread&quot; in both languages.
=== Folklore and religion ===

Most Komi myths are related to shamanism and paganism. The most widespread myths are about the creation of the world as a result of the struggle of two gods, En (Komi: Ен) and Omöl&#x27; (Komi: Омöль). These 2 deities are regarded as creator-gods in the Komi mythos, who created all life in the world (though it was En who would vivify them). As the Komi were gradually Christianized, the depictions of En &amp; Omöl began to mirror those of God and Satan, in which Omöl would be depicted as the latter due to his efforts to hamper En&#x27;s creation process. 

Even with the Christianization of the Komi, there are relatively few Christian legends and tales in the folklore of the Komi, but tales of c&quot;hudins&quot;, who are pagans and flee away from the new order to the forests, have become widespread. Some notable characters from Komi mythology include Jirkap (Йиркап) from Sindor, who is thought by the Komi to have invented skis, Joma (Ёма) who is regarded to be a Komi equivalent to the Baba Yaga and Pera (Пера) who is a character from the tales of the Komi-Permyaks known for his courage.

Information regarding the pre-Christian Komi religion is not well researched, with formal research by Russian ethnologists only beginning during the later half of the 19th century. Klavdij Alekseevich Popov (1874), Alexandr Vasilevich Krasov (1896), and (1901) all made attempts to reconstruct the ancient religion of the Komi-Zyryans. Nikolai Abramovich Rogov (1858, 1860), Nikolai Dobrotvorsky (1883), Ivan Nikolaevich Smirnov (1891), and Vladimir Mikhailovich Yanovich (1903) made reconstructions of the aspects of the Komi religion focusing on the natural world. According to &quot;The Life of Saint Stefan, the Bishop of Perm&quot; (1897) by Epiphany the Wise, the Komi ancestors had many deities, whose wooden images stood in dedicated cult sanctuaries for higher-ranking deities, while those of domestic deities were kept in Komi dwellings.

== Genetics ==

=== Uniparental lineages ===
More than half of Komi-Zyryan men have haplogroup N, which is typical for the Uralic-speaking peoples. 37% carry its subclade N1c and 18.5 percent belong to subgroup N-P43. The second most common Y-haplogroup for Komi is R1a (27.4%).

Among the mtDNA haplogroups, the most common is H (33%). About one in four have the haplogroup U. 13.6 % belong to its subgroup U4 and 9.9% belong to subgroup U5. Haplogroup T is found with a frequency of 13.3%.

=== Autosomal DNA ===
A study on northeastern European populations, published in March 2013, found that Komi-Zyryans form a distinct pole of genetic diversity.

According to a 2018 study, approximately 19% of Komi autosomal ancestry can be estimated to be Nganasan-like. This Siberian-related component is typical for Uralic populations.

<text>Budd Schulberg (born Seymour Wilson Schulberg; March 27, 1914 – August 5, 2009) was an American screenwriter, television producer, novelist and sports writer. He was known for his novels &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (1947), as well as his screenplays for &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), receiving an Academy Award for the former.

==Early life and education==
Schulberg was raised in a Jewish family the son of Hollywood film-producer B. P. Schulberg and Adeline (née Jaffe) Schulberg, who founded a talent agency taken over by her brother, agent/film producer Sam Jaffe. In 1931, when Schulberg was 17, his father left the family to live with actress Sylvia Sidney. His parents divorced in 1933.

Schulberg attended Deerfield Academy and then went on to Dartmouth College, where he was actively involved in the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot; humor magazine and was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. In 1939, he collaborated on the screenplay for &quot;Winter Carnival&quot;, a light comedy set at Dartmouth. One of his collaborators was F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was fired because of his alcoholic binge during a visit with Schulberg to Dartmouth. Dartmouth College awarded Schulberg an honorary degree in 1960.

==World War II==
While serving in the Navy during World War II, Schulberg was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), working with John Ford&#x27;s documentary unit, the Field Photographic Branch. Following VE Day, he witnessed the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. He was involved in gathering evidence against war criminals for the Nuremberg Trials, an assignment that included arresting propaganda film maker Leni Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, Austria, ostensibly to have her identify the faces of Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops. Riefenstahl claimed she was not aware of the nature of the concentration camps. According to Schulberg, &quot;She gave me the usual song and dance. She said: &#x27;Of course, you know, I&#x27;m really so misunderstood. I&#x27;m not political.&#x27;&quot;

Georgy Avenarius, a film critic before the war and the Soviet major in charge of UFA GmbH Babelsberg Studio in Soviet Berlin, allowed the Field Photo team access to the Nazi newsreels and propaganda films in his custody upon learning that his admired Ford was the branch head.

Budd, his brother Stuart Schulberg and the team at Field Photo presented two films during the trial: &quot;Nazi Concentration Camps&quot;, from Allied films shot during the liberation of the camps, and &quot;The Nazi Plan&quot;, from German sources.

==Career==
Being the son of a successful Hollywood producer gave Schulberg an insider&#x27;s viewpoint on the true happenings of Hollywood, which was reflected in much of his writing.

His 1941 novel &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; allowed the public to see the harshness of Hollywood stardom via Sammy Glick&#x27;s rise to power in a major Hollywood film studio. This novel was criticized by some as being self-directed anti-semitism. Then a member of the Communist Party USA, Schulberg quit in protest after he was ordered by high-ranking Party member John Howard Lawson to make changes to the novel. Schulburg has said that the Sammy Glick character was a &quot;composite&quot; based partly on producer Jerry Wald and Milton Spurling, who was Harry Warner&#x27;s son-in-law.
In 1950, Schulberg published &quot;The Disenchanted,&quot; about a young screenwriter who collaborates on a screenplay about a college winter festival with a famous novelist at the nadir of his career. The novelist (who was then assumed by reviewers to be a thinly disguised portrait of Fitzgerald, who had died 10 years earlier) is portrayed as a tragic, flawed figure, with whom the young screenwriter becomes disillusioned. The novel was the tenth bestselling novel in the United States in 1950 and was adapted as a Broadway play in 1958, starring Jason Robards (who won a Tony Award for his performance) and George Grizzard as the character loosely based on Schulberg. In 1958, Schulberg wrote and co-produced (with his younger brother Stuart) the film &quot;Wind Across the Everglades,&quot; directed by Nicholas Ray.

Schulberg wrote the 1957 film &quot;A Face in the Crowd.&quot; Based on the short story &quot;Your Arkansas Traveler&quot; in his book &quot;Some Faces in the Crowd,&quot; the film starred newcomer Andy Griffith as an obscure country singer who rises to fame and becomes extraordinarily manipulative to preserve his success and power.

Schulberg encountered political controversy in 1951 when screenwriter Richard Collins, testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), named Schulberg as a former member of the Communist Party. Schulberg, still resentful of the influence Communist officials tried to exert over his fiction, testified as a friendly witness and explained how Communist Party members had sought to influence the content of &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; and &quot;named names&quot; of other Hollywood communists.

Schulberg was also a sports writer and former chief boxing correspondent for &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; He wrote some well-received books on boxing, including &quot;Sparring with Hemingway.&quot; He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his contributions to the sport. 

In 1965, after a devastating riot had ripped apart the fabric of the Watts section of Los Angeles, Schulberg formed the Watts Writers Workshop in an attempt to ease frustrations and bring artistic training to the economically impoverished district.

In 1981, Schulberg wrote &quot;Moving Pictures: Memories of a Hollywood Prince&quot;, an autobiography covering his youth in Hollywood growing up in the 1920s and 1930s among the famous motion picture actors and producers as the son of B. P. Schulberg, head of Paramount Studios.

==Personal life and death==

Schulberg was married four times. In 1936, he married his first wife, actress Virginia &quot;Jigee&quot; Lee Ray. They had one daughter, Victoria, before divorcing in 1942. In 1943, he married Victoria &quot;Vickee&quot; Anderson. They divorced in 1964. They had two children: Stephen (born 1944) and David (born 1946). David was a Vietnam veteran who predeceased his father. In 1964, he married actress Geraldine Brooks. They were married until her death in 1977; they had no children. In 1977, he married Betsy Anne Langman, daughter of Anne W. Simon, stepdaughter of real estate developer Robert E. Simon, granddaughter of investment banker Maurice Wertheim and great-granddaughter of US ambassador Henry Morgenthau Sr.; they had two children: Benn and Jessica.

His niece Sandra Schulberg was an executive producer of the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Quills&quot;. His mother, of the Ad Schulberg Agency, served as his agent until her death in 1977. His brother, Stuart Schulberg, was a movie and television producer (&quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;). His sister, Sonya Schulberg (O&#x27;Sullivan) (1918–2016), was an occasional writer (of a novel, &quot;They Cried a Little&quot;, and stories).

Budd Schulberg died on August 5, 2009, in his home in Westhampton Beach, New York, aged 95.

<doc id="482979" wikidata="Q878675" url="?curid=482979" title="Og">
<text>Og ( ; ; ) was, according to the Hebrew Bible and other sources, an Amorite king of Bashan who was slain along with his army by Moses and his men at the battle of Edrei. In Arabic literature he is referred to as ʿŪj ibn ʿAnāq (, &quot;Og son of Anaq,&quot; Anaq being a daughter of Adam in Islamic tradition).

Og is introduced in the Book of Numbers. Like his neighbor Sihon of Heshbon, whom Moses had previously conquered at the battle of Jahaz, he was an Amorite king, the ruler of Bashan, which contained sixty walled cities and many unwalled towns, with his capital at Ashtaroth (probably modern Tell Ashtara, where there still exists a mound).

The Book of Numbers, Chapter 21, and Deuteronomy, Chapter 3, continues:

Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan, where King Og and his entire army attacked us at Edrei. But the Lord told me, &quot;Do not be afraid of him, for I have given you victory over Og and his entire army, and I will give you all his land. Treat him just as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.&quot;

So the Lord our God handed King Og and all his people over to us, and we killed them all. Not a single person survived. We conquered all sixty of his towns—the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest. These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also took many unwalled villages at the same time. We completely destroyed the kingdom of Bashan, just as we had destroyed King Sihon of Heshbon. We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered—men, women, and children alike. But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns.

So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River—all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon. (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.) We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og&#x27;s kingdom in Bashan. (King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)

Og&#x27;s destruction is told in Psalms 135:11 and 136:20 as one of many great victories for the nation of Israel, and the Book of Amos 2:9 may refer to Og as &quot;the Amorite&quot; whose height was like the height of the cedars and whose strength was like that of the oaks. The text states that he was the last giant of the Rephaites. His stature made him sleep on an iron bed, which was about 9 cubits in length.

==Og and the Rephaim==
In Deuteronomy 3:11, and later in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the Rephaim. Rephaim is a Hebrew word for giants. Deuteronomy 3:11 declares that his &quot;bedstead&quot; (translated in some texts as &quot;sarcophagus&quot;) of iron is &quot;nine cubits in length and four cubits in width&quot;, which is according to the standard cubit of a man. It goes on to say that at the royal city of Rabbah of the Ammonites, his giant bedstead could still be seen as a novelty at the time the narrative was written. If the giant king&#x27;s bedstead was built in proportion to his size as most beds are, he may have been between in height. However, later Rabbinic tradition has it, that the length of his bedstead was measured with the cubits of Og himself. 

Michael S. Heiser argues that the reference to Og&#x27;s bed is a link to the sacred marriage bed of Marduk, and so the dimensions are not a reliable indicator of Og&#x27;s size.

It is noteworthy that the region north of the river Jabbok, or Bashan, &quot;the land of Rephaim&quot;, contains hundreds of megalithic stone tombs (dolmen) dating from the 5th to 3rd millennia BC. In 1918, Gustav Dalman discovered in the neighborhood of Amman, Jordan (Amman is built on the ancient city of Rabbah of Ammon) a noteworthy dolmen which matched the approximate dimensions of Og&#x27;s bed as described in the Bible. Such ancient rock burials are seldom seen west of the Jordan river, and the only other concentration of these megaliths are to be found in the hills of Judah in the vicinity of Hebron, where the giant sons of Anak were said to have lived (Numbers 13:33).

==Og in non-Biblical inscriptions==

In 1974, Wolfgang Röllig published a Phoenician inscription from Byblos (Byblos 13) which he argued it contained a reference to a deity named &quot;Og&quot;. According to Röllig, it appears in a damaged 7-line funerary inscription that Röllig dates to around 500 BC, and appears to say that if someone disturbs the bones of the occupant, &quot;the mighty Og will avenge me.&quot; Frank Moore Cross disputed Röllig&#x27;s interpretation, proposing that the line of the inscription in question reads instead &quot;my decrepit/mouldering bones&quot;.

A possible connection to Og and the Rephaim kings of Bashan can also be made with the much older Canaanite Ugaritic text KTU 1.108 from the 13th century B.C., which uses the term &quot;king&quot; in association with the root /rp/ or &quot;Rapah&quot; (the Rephaim of the Bible) and geographic place names that probably correspond to the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei in the Bible, and with which king Og is expressly said to have ruled from (Deuteronomy 1:4; Joshua 9:10; 12:4; 13:12, 31). The clay tablet from Ugarit KTU 1.108 reads in whole, &quot;May Rapiu, King of Eternity, drink [w]ine, yea, may he drink, the powerful and noble [god], the god enthroned in Ashtarat, the god who rules in Edrei, whom men hymn and honour with music on the lyre and the flute, on drum and cymbals, with castanets of ivory, among the goodly companions of Kothar. And may Anat the powerful drink, the mistress of kingship, the mistress of dominion, the mistress of the high heavens, [the mistre]ss of the earth.&quot; Og&#x27;s existence and true identity is disputed. According to Matthew McAffee, the historical reminiscenses of Ugaritic mythology indicate that the Hebrew Bible has probably preserved a genuinely ancient tradition of an Amorite king Og stemming from the 2nd millennium BC. He also argues that the description of Og as a Rephaim seems to reflect an Old Amorite theology which gave such status to their deceased kings.

==In the Talmud==
The Jewish Talmud embellishes the story, stating that Og was so large that he sought the destruction of the Israelites by uprooting a mountain so large, that it would have crushed the entire Israelite encampment. The Lord caused a swarm of ants to dig away the center of the mountain, which was resting on Og&#x27;s head. The mountain then fell onto Og&#x27;s shoulders. As Og attempted to lift the mountain off himself, the Lord caused Og&#x27;s teeth to lengthen outward, becoming embedded into the mountain that was now surrounding his head. Moses, fulfilling Yahweh&#x27;s injunction not to fear him, seized a stick of ten cubits length, and jumped a similar vertical distance, succeeding in striking Og in the ankle. Og fell down and died upon hitting the ground.
Many great rabbis, notably Shlomo ibn Aderet, have explained this story in an allegorical manner.

==In Islam==

&#x27;Uj ibn Anaq (&#x27;Ûj ibn &#x27;Anâq) is a giant in Islamic mythology. Uj is not namely mentioned in the Quran or canonical hadiths. The origins of this character lay in Jewish folklore and the Old Testament, e.g. king Og. He takes his matronymic from his mother ʿAnāq who begat him after an incestuous affair.

Famous and much-painted episodes include his fight with the Prophet Moses (see &quot;Musa va &#x27;Uj&quot;), and his fishing and frying of whales, while he stands just about knee-deep in the ocean.

==&quot;Ogias the Giant&quot;==
The 2nd-century BC apocryphal book &quot;Ogias the Giant&quot; or &quot;The Book of Giants&quot; depicts the adventures of a giant named Ogias who fought a great dragon, and who was supposedly either identical with the Biblical Og or was Og&#x27;s father.

The book enjoyed considerable currency for several centuries, especially due to having been taken up by the Manichaean religion.

==Hurtaly==
In &quot;Pantagruel&quot;, Rabelais lists Hurtaly (a version of Og) as one of Pantagruel&#x27;s ancestors. He describes Hurtaly as sitting astride the Ark, saving it from shipwreck by guiding it with his feet as the grateful Noah and his family feed him through the chimney.

<doc id="482983" wikidata="Q470057" url="?curid=482983" title="American Pastoral">
<text>American Pastoral is a Philip Roth 
novel published in 1997 concerning Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov, a successful Jewish American businessman and former high school star athlete from Newark, New Jersey. Levov&#x27;s happy and conventional upper middle class life is ruined by the domestic social and political turmoil of the 1960s during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, which in the novel is described as a manifestation of the &quot;indigenous American berserk&quot;. It is the first in Roth&#x27;s &quot;American Trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Human Stain&quot; (2000).

The framing device in &quot;American Pastoral&quot; is a 45th high school reunion attended by frequent Roth alter ego Nathan Zuckerman, who is the narrator. At the reunion, in 1995, Zuckerman meets former classmate Jerry Levov who describes to him the tragic derailment of the life of his recently deceased older brother, Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Levov. After Seymour&#x27;s teenage daughter Merry, in 1968, set off a bomb in protest against American involvement in the Vietnam War, killing a bystander, and subsequently went into hiding, Seymour remained traumatized for the rest of his life. The rest of the novel consists of Zuckerman&#x27;s posthumous recreation of Seymour&#x27;s life, based on Jerry&#x27;s revelation, a few newspaper clippings, and Zuckerman&#x27;s own impressions after two brief run-ins with &quot;the Swede.&quot; In these encounters, which take place early in the novel, Zuckerman learns that Seymour has remarried and has three young sons, but Seymour&#x27;s daughter Merry is never mentioned. In Zuckerman&#x27;s reimagining of Seymour&#x27;s life, this second marriage has no part; it ends in 1973 with Watergate unraveling on TV while the previous lives of the protagonists completely disintegrate.

&quot;American Pastoral&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998. Seven years later, the novel was included in &quot;Time&quot; List of the 100 Best Novels, a list covering the period between 1923 and 2005. The film rights to it were later optioned, though a film version was not made until 2016. In 2006, it was one of the runners-up to Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; in the &quot;What is the Best Work of American Fiction of the Last 25 Years?&quot; contest held by the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; along with Don DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot;, Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; and John Updike&#x27;s collected &quot;Rabbit Angstrom&quot; (consisting of &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;, &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot;, &quot;Rabbit is Rich&quot; and &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot;.)

==Plot==
Seymour Irving Levov is born and raised in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, in 1927 as the elder son of a successful Jewish American glove manufacturer, Lou Levov, and his wife Sylvia. Called &quot;the Swede&quot; because of his anomalous blond hair, blue eyes and Nordic good looks, Seymour is a star athlete in high school, a two-year veteran of the Marine Corps, and the narrator Nathan Zuckerman&#x27;s idol and hero. Zuckerman and Seymour&#x27;s younger brother, Jerry—who grows into a curmudgeonly, irascible heart surgeon with little empathy for the Swede—are schoolmates and close friends. The Swede eventually takes over his father&#x27;s glove factory and marries Dawn Dwyer, a former beauty queen from nearby Elizabeth, whom he met in college. Following the death of the Swede from prostate cancer, Zuckerman writes an account of what he imagines the Swede&#x27;s experiences would have been based on the little background information he receives from Jerry.

Seymour establishes what he believes to be a perfect American life with a beloved wife and daughter, a satisfying business career, and a magnificent house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. Yet, as the Vietnam War and racial unrest wrack the country and destroy inner-city Newark, his precocious teenage daughter Meredith (&quot;Merry&quot;), beset by an emotionally debilitating stutter and outraged by the war, becomes increasingly radical in her beliefs. In February 1968, Merry plants a bomb in the Old Rimrock post office, which kills a bystander; she goes into permanent hiding. Seymour finds Merry five years later, living in deplorable conditions in inner-city Newark. During this reunion, Merry reveals that she was responsible for several more bombings, killing three more people. Although Merry informs him that her actions were deliberate, Seymour decides to keep their meeting a secret, believing Merry has been manipulated by an unknown political group and a mysterious woman named Rita Cohen.

At a dinner party, Seymour discovers that his wife Dawn has been having an affair with Princeton-educated architect William Orcutt III, for whom she undergoes a facelift. Seymour then realizes that his wife is planning to leave him for Orcutt. It is revealed that Seymour himself previously had a short-term affair with Merry&#x27;s speech therapist, Sheila Salzman, and that she and her husband Shelly hid Merry in their home after the post office bombing. Seymour sadly concludes that everyone he knows may have a veneer of respectability, but each engages in subversive behavior and that he cannot understand the truth about anyone based upon the conduct they outwardly display. He is forced to see the truth about the chaos and discord rumbling beneath the &quot;American pastoral&quot;, which has brought about profound personal and societal changes he no longer can ignore. Simultaneously, the dinner party underscores the fact that no one ever truly understands the hearts of other people.

==Historical setting==

The novel alludes extensively to the social upheavals of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It refers to the 1967 Newark riots, the Watergate scandal, the sexual revolution and Deep Throat, the code name of the secret source in the Watergate scandal and the title of a 1972 pornographic film. In the novel&#x27;s final scene, both the Watergate scandal and the pornographic film are discussed at a dinner party during which the first marriage of &quot;the Swede&quot; begins to unravel when he discovers that his wife is having an affair. The novel also alludes to the rhetoric of revolutionary violence of the radical fringe of the New Left, the Black Panthers, the trial of the leftist African-American activist Angela Davis, and the bombings carried out between 1969 and 1973 by the Weathermen and other radicals opposing the US military intervention in Vietnam. The novel quotes from Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;A Dying Colonialism&quot;, which Zuckerman imagines as one of the texts that inspires Merry to carry out her bombing of a local post office.

In the novel, there is a slight plot/historical anomaly since a &quot;Weatherman motto&quot; is tacked to Merry&#x27;s wall about two years before the phrase was actually uttered: Merry&#x27;s bombing takes place in February 1968, during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, after which she flees her parental home. By that time she has had a &quot;Weathermen motto&quot; tacked up in her room for many months. In reality this would have been impossible. The Weathermen group was, in fact, formed in the summer of 1969. The lines of the &quot;motto&quot; which appear in the novel (&quot;We are against everything that is good and decent in honky America. We will loot and burn and destroy. We are the incubation of your mothers&#x27; nightmares.&quot;) allude to a speech by John Jacobs at a Weathermen &quot;war council&quot; in December 1969.

The inspiration for the Levov character was a real person: Seymour &quot;Swede&quot; Masin, a legendary all-around Jewish athlete who, like the Levov character, attended Newark&#x27;s Weequahic High School. Like the book&#x27;s protagonist, Swede Masin was revered and idolized by many local middle-class Jews. Both &quot;Swedes&quot; were tall and had distinctively blond hair and blue eyes, which stood out among the typically dark-haired, dark-complexioned local residents. Both attended a teachers&#x27; college in nearby East Orange; both married out of their faith; both served in the military and, upon their return, both moved to the suburbs of Newark.

&quot;American Pastoral&quot; was a scrupulously researched book: Roth traveled to Gloversville, New York, to learn about the glove-making industry and interviewed Yolande Fox, the winner of the 1951 Miss America pageant, while developing the character of Dawn Dwyer. Roth later said, of his conversations with Fox, &quot;She was very smart, very funny. ... She just opened up whole ideas for me that I couldn&#x27;t have had on my own.&quot;

The book cover features a photo of the post office in Brookside, New Jersey.

== Reception ==
After Roth&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked several prominent writers to pick their favorite work by Roth, and many picked &quot;American Pastoral&quot;. Richard Ford, in his response, wrote: &quot;The fusing powers of Roth’s imagination, conviction and raging intelligence are everywhere evident and exhilarating. There is about it a profound and heartening sense (and it is a profound book) that the verbal construction you’re undertaking as a reader represents absolutely the only way this mighty story could ever be brought into existence. &quot;American Pastoral&quot; stares back at me audaciously unblinking as a great novel. And although such a rambunctious piece of artifice can inevitably not be perfect, it is nonetheless in all its ways right.&quot; Stephen King also chose it as his favorite Roth novel, writing: &quot;&quot;American Pastoral&quot; is one of the five best novels I have ever read, maybe &quot;the&quot; best. It is muscular storytelling complemented by characters — especially Swede Levov — who burn their way into one’s memory. The scope is relatively small, but the ambition is epic. Few can handle the passing years as well as Roth does here. It ranks with the greatest of American fiction.&quot; Harold Bloom named Roth one of the greatest living American authors, alongside Cormac McCarthy, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo, naming their respective masterpieces as &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot; and &quot;American Pastoral&quot;; &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;; &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;; and &quot;Underworld.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

Ewan McGregor directed and starred in the film along with Jennifer Connelly and Dakota Fanning. Filming began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in September 2015, and the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2016.

<text>is a papal bull that was issued by Pope Boniface VIII on 18 November 1302. It laid down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation, the position of the Pope as supreme head of the Church and the duty thence arising of submission to the Pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The Pope further emphasized the higher position of the spiritual in comparison with the secular order. The historian Brian Tierney calls it &quot;probably the most famous&quot; document on church and state in medieval Europe. The original document is lost, but a version of the text can be found in the registers of Boniface VIII in the Vatican Archives. The bull was the definitive statement of the late medieval theory of hierocracy, which argued for the temporal as well as spiritual supremacy of the pope.


==Background==

The bull was promulgated during an ongoing dispute between Boniface VIII and King Philip IV of France (Philip the Fair). Philip had levied taxes on the French clergy of half their annual income. On 5 February 1296, Boniface responded with the papal bull &quot;Clericis laicos&quot; that forbade clerics, without authority from the Holy See, to pay taxes to temporal rulers, and threatened excommunication on rulers who demanded such payments.

King Edward I of England defended his own taxing powers by putting defiant clergy under outlawry, a Roman law concept withdrawing their protection under the English common law, and confiscated the temporal properties of bishops who refused his levies. As Edward was demanding an amount well above the tenth offered by the clergy, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Winchelsey left it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit.

In August 1296 King Philip imposed an embargo forbidding export of horses, arms, gold, and silver, effectively keeping the French clergy from sending taxes to Rome and blocking a main source of papal revenue. Philip also banished from France papal agents raising funds for a new crusade.

In September 1296 the pope sent a protest to Philip headed &quot;&quot; that declared that he would rather suffer death than surrender any of the rightful prerogatives of the Church. While threatening a papal alliance with England and Germany, the pope soothingly explained that his claims were not intended against the customary feudal dues, and that reasonable taxation of Church revenue would be permitted. To assist their king against the Anglo-Flemish alliance, the French bishops asked permission to make contributions for the defense of the kingdom. In February 1297, Boniface issued &quot;Romana mater ecclesia&quot;, declaring that when the clergy consented to make payments and delay could cause grave danger, papal permission could be dispensed, and ratified the French payments in the encyclical &quot;Corum illo fatemur&quot;. While insisting that Church consent was required for subsidies to the state, he recognised that the clergy in each country must evaluate such claims. In July 1297, Boniface, further beset by an uprising in Rome by the Colonna family, again moderated his assertions in &quot;Clericis laicos.&quot; The bull &quot;Etsi de statu&quot; allowed lay authorities to declare emergencies to tax clerical property. 

The Jubilee year of 1300 filled Rome with fervent masses of pilgrims who supplied the lack of French gold in the treasury. The following year, Philip&#x27;s ministers overstepped their bounds. In the Albigensian Crusade, the suppression of the Cathar heresy had brought much of Languedoc under French royal control, but in the farthest south, heretics still survived, and Bernard Saisset, Bishop of Pamiers in Foix, was recalcitrant and insolent with king. Philip&#x27;s ministry decided to make an example of the bishop, who was brought before the royal court on 24 October 1301. The chancellor, Pierre Flotte, charged him with high treason, and put the bishop in the keeping of his metropolitan, the archbishop of Narbonne. Before Saisset could be tried, the royal ministry needed the Pope to strip the bishop of his office and protections, a &quot;canonical degradation&quot;. Instead, in December 1301 Boniface ordered the bishop to Rome to justify himself before his pope rather than his king. In the bull &#x27; (&quot;Give ear, my son&quot;), he scolded Phillip: &quot;Let no one persuade you that you have no superior or that you are not subject to the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, for he is a fool who so thinks.&quot; At the same time, Boniface sent out the general bull &#x27; strongly reiterating &quot;&quot;.

With his customary tactlessness, Boniface then summoned the French bishops to Rome to reform their national Church matters. Philip forbade Saisset or any bishop to attend, and organized a counterassembly of his own in Paris in April 1302. Nobles, burgesses and clergy met to denounce the Pope and pass around a crude forgery, &quot;Deum Time&quot; (&quot;Fear God&quot;), in which Boniface supposedly claimed feudal suzerainty over France, an &quot;unheard-of assertion&quot;. Boniface denied the document and its claims, but reminded Phillip that previous popes had deposed three French kings.

This was the atmosphere in which &quot;Unam sanctam&quot; was promulgated weeks later. Reading of the &quot;two swords&quot; (the spiritual and temporal powers), one of Philip&#x27;s ministers is alleged to have remarked, &quot;My master&#x27;s sword is steel; the Pope&#x27;s is made of words&quot;. As Matthew Edward Harris writes, &quot;The overall impression gained is that the papacy was described in increasingly exalted terms as the thirteenth century progressed, although this development was neither disjunctive nor uniform, and was often in response to conflict, such as against Frederick II and Philip the Fair&quot;.

==Content==
Most significantly, the bull proclaimed the doctrine &quot;extra ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; (&quot;outside of the Church, there is no salvation)&quot;. The phrase is first found in Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) discussing the validity of baptisms by heretical clergy. Gregory of Nazianzus also held that view but, with his father as an example, recognized men whose devout conduct anticipates their faith: by the charity of their life they were united to Christ, even before explicitly professing Christianity. Subsequent commentators such as Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, and Bede cited the doctrine in an ecclesiastical context.

Boniface interpreted it as a form of the concept of &quot;plenitudo potestatis&quot; (plenitude of power), that those who resist the Roman Pontiff resist God&#x27;s ordination. In the 13th century, the canonists used the term &quot;plenitudo potestatis&quot; to characterize the power of the Pope within the church or, more rarely, his prerogative in the secular sphere. The bull declares that the Church must be united and the Pope was its sole and absolute head: &quot;Therefore, of the one and only Church there is one body and one head, not two heads like a monster&quot;.

The bull also stated, &quot;We are informed by the texts of the gospels that in this Church and in its power are two swords; namely, the spiritual and the temporal.&quot; The metaphor refers to the swords yielded by the Apostles upon Christ&#x27;s arrest (Luke 22:38; Matthew 26:52). Early theologians believed that if there are two swords, one must be subordinate to the other, rungs in a spiritual hierarchical ladder: the spiritual judges the secular &quot;on account of its greatness and sublimity&quot;, and the higher spiritual power judges the lower spiritual power etc. Thus, the bull concluded, the temporal authorities must submit to the spiritual authorities, not merely on matters concerning doctrine and morality: &quot;For with truth as our witness, it belongs to spiritual power to establish the terrestrial power and to pass judgment if it has not been good&quot;. The bull ended, &quot;Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff&quot;
The bull reiterated the declarations of popes since Gregory VII, as well as the writings of Bernard of Clairvaux, Hugh of Saint Victor and Thomas Aquinas. The bull also contained passages from the letters of Pope Innocent III, who mainly reasserted the spiritual power and the &quot;plenitudo potestatis&quot; of the papacy. A voice heavily noticed in the bull is Giles of Rome, who some hold might have been its actual writer. Giles, in &quot;On Ecclesiastical Power&quot;, voiced the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff over the material world. He argued that since the body is governed by the soul, and the soul is governed by the spiritual ruler, the Roman Pontiff is the governor of both soul and body.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, on the margin of the text of the record, the last sentence is noted as its real definition: &quot;Declaratio quod subesse Romano Pontifici est omni humanae creaturae de necessitate salutis&quot; (&quot;A declaration that it is necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff&quot;); thus this phrase, like some in canonical scripture, may have moved from an original position as a marginal gloss to an integral part of the text as it has been accepted. Some believe that this is the only intended dogmatic definition in the bull because the rest is based on differing &quot;papal claims of the thirteenth century&quot;. Eamon Duffy finds most of the claims in the encyclical to be similar to those made by every pope since Gregory VII. However, what made his claim &quot;notorious&quot; was that Boniface &quot;insisted that the Pope wielded both the spiritual and secular sword, [...] the culminating blow in a propaganda war against the French crown.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Boniface&#x27;s reputation for overweening papal claims made it difficult to accept such an extreme declaration. His assertion over the temporal was seen as hollow and misguided, and it is said that the document was not seen as authoritative because the body of the faithful did not accept it.

Philip had the Dominican John of Paris issue a refutation. Boniface reacted by excommunicating Philip, who then called an assembly which made 29 accusations against the pope, including infidelity, heresy, simony, gross and unnatural immorality, idolatry, magic, loss of the Holy Land and the death of Pope Celestine V. Five archbishops and 21 bishops sided with the king.

Boniface could respond only by denouncing the charges, but it was already too late for him. On 7 September 1303, the king&#x27;s advisor, Guillaume de Nogaret, led a band of 2000 mercenaries on horse and foot who joined locals in an attack on the palaces of the Pope and his nephew at the papal residence at Anagni, which was later referred to as the Outrage of Anagni. The Pope&#x27;s attendants and his beloved nephew Francesco all soon fled; only the Spaniard Pedro Rodríguez, Cardinal of Santa Sabina, remained at his side to the end.

The palace was plundered, and Boniface escaped murder only upon Nogaret&#x27;s explicit order. Boniface was subjected to harassment and held prisoner for three days without food or drink. Eventually, the townsfolk expelled the marauders. According to a late and unverified tradition, the locals were rallied and led by Cardinal Luca Fieschi. Boniface pardoned those who were captured and was escorted back to Rome on 13 September 1303.

Boniface was shaken by the incident. He developed a violent fever and died on 11 October 1303. In &quot;A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century&quot;, Barbara W. Tuchman stated that his close advisors would later maintain that he had died of a &quot;profound chagrin&quot;.

Boniface&#x27;s successor, Pope Benedict XI, reigned for only nine months. He removed himself and the Roman Curia from the violence of Rome as soon as the Easter celebrations of 1304 were completed. However, on 7 June 1304, from Perugia, he excommunicated Guillaume de Nogaret, Reynald de Supino, his son Robert, Thomas de Morolo, Peter of Gennazano, his son Stephen, Adenulph and Nicolas, the sons of a certain Matteo, Geoffrey Bussy, Orlando and Pietro de Luparia of Anagni, Sciarra Colonna, John the son of Landolph, Gottifredus the son of John de Ceccano, Maximus de Trebes, and other leaders of the factions who had attacked Boniface. He died on 7 July 1304. The conclave to pick his successor was in deadlock for eleven months before deciding, under the intimidation of King Charles II of Naples, on Archbishop Bertrand de Got of Bordeaux, who took the name Pope Clement V. To please Philip IV of France, Clement moved his residence to Avignon. From then until around 1378, the Church fell under the domination of the French monarchy. Philip was said to have held a vendetta against the Holy See until his death.

It was not only the French monarchy and clergy who disapproved of Boniface and his assertions. Writers throughout Europe attacked the bull and Boniface&#x27;s bold claims for the power of the papacy over the temporal, most notably the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who expressed his need for another strong Holy Roman Emperor. Dante&#x27;s treatise &quot;De Monarchia&quot; attempted to refute the Pope&#x27;s claim that the spiritual sword had power over the temporal sword. Dante pointed out that the Pope and Roman Emperor were both equally human, and thus peers. The two &quot;equal swords&quot; were given power by God to rule over their respective domains.

<doc id="482987" wikidata="Q5285230" url="?curid=482987" title="Djanet Sears">
<text>Djanet Sears is a Canadian playwright, nationally recognized for her work in African-Canadian theatre. Sears has many credits in writing and editing highly acclaimed dramas such as &quot;Afrika Solo&quot;, the first stage play to be written by a Canadian woman of African descent; its sequel &quot;Harlem Duet&quot;; and &quot;The Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God&quot;. The complexities of intersecting identities of race and gender are central themes in her works, as well as inclusion of songs, rhythm, and choruses shaped from West African traditions. She is also passionate about &quot;the preservation of Black theatre history,&quot; and involved in the creation of organizations like the Obsidian Theatre and AfriCanadian Playwrights Festival.

== Early life and education ==
Djanet Sears was born in 1959 in England, to a Guyanese father and a Jamaican mother. She lived there until 1974 when her family moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and then settled in Oakville, Ontario, in 1975. Her birth name was Janet — she added the D after a trip to West Africa where she came across a plateau called &quot;Djanet,&quot; inspiring her to change her name as a nod to her African ancestry.

Sears attended York University, where she obtained an Honours Bachelor of Fine Arts in theatre in 1999, followed by studies at the Canadian Film Centre and New York University.

== Career ==
After returning from a trip to West Africa, Sears wrote her stage play &quot;Afrika Solo&quot;, which premiered in 1987, and sparked the creation of many other full-length plays like &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Harlem Duet&quot;. Sears is not only a writer for theatre but also has many credits in acting, directing, and editing multiple volumes of an anthology of Canadian African plays called &quot;Testifyin&#x27;: Contemporary African Canadian Drama.&quot;

Sears contributed to the creation of the AfriCanadian Playwrights Festival in 1997, which is a culmination of African-centred plays on the Canadian stage. It was held in Toronto in 2003 as well as 2006. Sears also belongs to and is a founding member of the Obsidian Theatre, &quot;dedicated to producing works by authors of African descent living or working in Canada.&quot;

Sears as an educator worked as an adjunct professor teaching drama at University College, University of Toronto. Additionally she has held many positions like the international artist-in-residence at Joseph Papp Public Theatre, the writer-in-residence at the University of Guelph, and playwright-in-residence at Nightwood Theatre.

== Plays ==
* &quot;Afrika Solo&quot; is primarily a one-woman show, along with a two-man chorus. It is a semi-autobiographical play that tells a story about a young woman trying to find herself getting through what new information she is learning along the way. The main character, Djanet, and her experiences are the focal point of the play.
* &quot;Harlem Duet&quot; takes inspiration from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. The play is set on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards. Sears choose this location because she wanted the audience to grasp the concept of race in Canada, and these streets were more familiar to the play&#x27;s North American audience. The story follows Othello and Billie and their withering marriage as Othello begins to lean towards a white identity, mostly because of his affair with a character named Mona, who is a white woman. The story paints a picture of North America dominated by whiteness.
* &quot;The Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God&quot; follows character Rainey, who is an African-Canadian doctor, and her hardships while living in Western Ontario. Rainey deals with losing a close family member, a failing marriage and tension between her and her father, who even with poor health and old age is on a mission to maintain his ethnic pride in his community.
* &quot;Who Killed Katie Ross&quot;
* &quot;Double Trouble&quot;
* &quot;The Mother Project&quot;

== Awards and honours ==
Sears full-length play &quot;Afrika Solo&quot; won the International Armstrong Award for Outstanding Radio Play (1991), and the Silver Prize at the International Radio Festival of New York (1991); its sequel &quot;Harlem Duet&quot; has acquired multiple Dora Mavor Moore Awards, and &quot;The Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God&quot; was shortlisted for the Trillium Book Award (2004). Sears&#x27;s other distinctions include an even more extensive list, including Canada&#x27;s highest literary award.
* Sears won The Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award (1998)
* Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award (1998)
* Martin Luther King Jr. Achievement Award (2004)

<doc id="482988" wikidata="Q1641494" url="?curid=482988" title="Hypoventilation">
<text>Hypoventilation (also known as respiratory depression) occurs when ventilation is inadequate (&quot;hypo&quot; meaning &quot;below&quot;) to perform needed respiratory gas exchange. By definition it causes an increased concentration of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis. Hypoventilation is not synonymous with respiratory arrest, in which breathing ceases entirely and death occurs within minutes due to hypoxia and leads rapidly into complete , although both are medical emergencies. Hypoventilation can be considered a precursor to hypoxia, and its lethality is attributed to hypoxia with carbon dioxide toxicity.

==Causes==
Hypoventilation may be caused by:
*A medical condition such as stroke affecting the brainstem
*Voluntary breath-holding or underbreathing, for example, hypoventilation training or the Buteyko method.
*Medication or drugs, typically when taken in accidental or intentional overdose. Opioids and benzodiazepines in particular are known to cause respiratory depression. Examples of opioids include pharmaceuticals such as oxycodone and hydromorphone and examples of benzodiazepines include lorazepam and alprazolam.
*Hypocapnia, which stimulates hypoventilation
*Obesity; see Obesity hypoventilation syndrome

* Chronic mountain sickness, a mechanism to conserve energy.

* Paralyzing venom, such as that of the blue ringed octopus.

===Medications===
As a side effect of medicines or recreational drugs, hypoventilation may become potentially life-threatening. Many different central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB, sedatives, and opioids produce respiratory depression when taken in large or excessive doses, or mixed with other depressants. Strong opiates (namely fentanyl, heroin, and morphine), barbiturates, and certain benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam) are known for depressing respiration. In an overdose, an individual may cease breathing entirely (go into respiratory arrest) which is rapidly fatal without treatment. Opioids, in overdose or combined with other depressants, are notorious for such fatalities. Nevertheless, appropriate use of opioids in the right setting, as seen in patients with advanced cancer have been shown to be helpful, but must be monitored very carefully, nonetheless.

==Treatment==
Respiratory stimulants such as nikethamide were traditionally used to counteract respiratory depression from CNS depressant overdose, but offered limited effectiveness. A new respiratory stimulant drug called BIMU8 is being investigated which seems to be significantly more effective and may be useful for counteracting the respiratory depression produced by opiates and similar drugs without offsetting their therapeutic effects.

If the respiratory depression occurs from opioid overdose, usually an opioid antagonist, most likely naloxone, will be administered. This will rapidly reverse the respiratory depression unless complicated by other depressants. However an opioid antagonist may also precipitate an opioid withdrawal syndrome in chronic users. Mechanical ventilation may still be necessary during initial resuscitation.

==Associated conditions==
Disorders like congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) and ROHHAD (rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, with autonomic dysregulation) are recognized as conditions that are associated with hypoventilation. CCHS may be a significant factor in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), often termed &quot;cot death&quot; or &quot;crib death&quot;.

The opposite condition is hyperventilation (too much ventilation), resulting in low carbon dioxide levels (hypocapnia), rather than hypercapnia.

<doc id="482989" wikidata="Q3297251" url="?curid=482989" title="Mashed Potato (dance)">
<text>The Mashed Potato is a dance move which was a popular dance craze of 1962. The dance move and mashed potato song were first made famous by James Brown in 1959 and used in his concerts regularly. It was also a dance done to songs such as Dee Dee Sharp&#x27;s &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot;. The move vaguely resembles that of the twist, by Sharp&#x27;s fellow Philadelphian Chubby Checker. The dance was first popularized internationally after being named in the lyrics of Motown&#x27;s first mega-hit in the song &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; written by Berry Gordy Jr. and performed by The Contours in 1962.

==Dance movement==
The dance move begins by stepping backward with one foot with that heel tilted inward. The foot is positioned slightly behind the other (stationary) foot. With the weight on the ball of the starting foot, the heel is then swiveled outward. The same process is repeated with the other foot: step back and behind with heel inward, pivot heel out, and so on. The pattern is continued for as many repetitions as desired. The step may be incorporated in various dances either as a separate routine or as a styling of standard steps.

==Songs==
Several songs inspired by the dance were hits, including &quot;(Do the) Mashed Potatoes&quot; by Nat Kendrick and the Swans (with vocals by King Coleman), &quot;Mashed Potatoes U.S.A.&quot; by James Brown, and &quot;Mashed Potato Time&quot; and &quot;Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)&quot;, both by Dee Dee Sharp.
In Australia the dance underwent a revival with Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs&#x27; version of &quot;Mashed Potato&quot; in 1964 and in France a song called &quot;C&#x27;est le mashed potatoes&quot; was performed by Johnny Hallyday in the early 1960s.

==Dance variations and cultural references==
The dance was also referred to in Connie Francis&#x27; 1962 hit &quot;V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N&quot; (&quot;...we&#x27;ll &quot;Mashed Potato&quot; to a jukebox tune...&quot;), &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; by the Contours, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; by Chris Montez, &quot;Harry the Hairy Ape&quot; a 1963 Top-20 pop and R&amp;B novelty hit by Ray Stevens, &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;, &quot;Having a Party&quot; by Sam Cooke, &quot;Do the Strand&quot; by Roxy Music and in Ray Charles&#x27; version of &quot;Shake a Tail Feather&quot;.
The dance is also referenced in The Orlons song &quot;Wah Watusi&quot;. (1962)

A variation on the Mashed Potato was danced to Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett&#x27;s novelty hit &quot;Monster Mash&quot;, in which the footwork was the same, but &quot;monster gestures&quot; were made with the arms and hands.

The dance was one of the inspirations for the Exodus song &quot;The Toxic Waltz&quot;, from their 1989 album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;.

<doc id="482990" wikidata="Q1819009" url="?curid=482990" title="Leonard Hayflick">
<text>Leonard Hayflick (May 20, 1928 – August 1, 2024) was an American anatomist who was Professor of Anatomy at the UCSF School of Medicine, and was Professor of Medical Microbiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He was also past president of the Gerontological Society of America and was a founding member of the council of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The recipient of a number of research prizes and awards, including the 1991 Sandoz Prize for Gerontological Research, he studied the ageing process for more than fifty years. He is known for discovering that normal human cells divide for a limited number of times &quot;in vitro&quot; (refuting the contention by Alexis Carrel that normal body cells are immortal). This is known as the Hayflick limit. His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember what doubling level they have reached. He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses. His cell strain WI-38 soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world&#x27;s human virus vaccines. Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary atypical pneumonia (also called &quot;walking pneumonia&quot;) was not a virus as previously believed. He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a mycoplasma, the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name. He named the organism &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;.

In 1959, Hayflick developed the first inverted microscope for use in cell culture research. To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype. His microscope was accessioned by the Smithsonian Institution in 2009.

Hayflick developed the first practical method for producing powdered cell culture media in 1965. This method is now used worldwide for the production of many tons of powdered media annually for use in research laboratories and commercial production facilities. The technique is not patented and Hayflick received no remuneration from this invention. 

Hayflick was the author of the book, &quot;How and Why We Age&quot;, published in August 1994 by Ballantine Books, New York City and available since 1996 as a paperback. This book has been translated into nine languages and is published in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Poland, Russia, and Spain. It was a selection of the Book of the Month Club and has sold over 50,000 copies worldwide.

Hayflick and his associates have vehemently condemned &quot;anti-aging medicine&quot; and criticized organizations such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. Hayflick has written numerous articles criticizing both the feasibility and desirability of human life extension, which have provoked responses critical of his views.

== Biography ==
Hayflick was born May 20, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1956. After receiving a post-doctoral fellowship for study at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston under the tutelage of the renowned cell culturist Charles M. Pomerat (1905–1964), he returned to Philadelphia, where he spent ten years as an Associate Member of the Wistar Institute and two years as an Assistant Professor of Research Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1968, Hayflick was appointed Professor of Medical Microbiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California. Hayflick resigned from Stanford in 1976 in protest to the behavior of a few of its administrators who were later shown to have wrongly accepted the beliefs of an NIH accountant who was unable to understand the unique concept of title to a self-duplicating biological system. Hayflick sued the NIH, who later agreed that the issue was in dispute. The behavior of Stanford and the NIH was later condemned by 85 prominent biologists who viewed him as having been &quot;exonerated&quot; by subsequent events. In 1982 he moved to the University of Florida, Gainesville, where he became Director of the Center for Gerontological Studies and Professor of Zoology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in the College of Medicine.

In 1988, Hayflick joined the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, where he was Professor of Anatomy. Hayflick was a member of numerous national and international scientific and public boards of directors and committees. He has been on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals. Hayflick was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal &quot;Experimental Gerontology&quot; for 13 years.

He was a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983. He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH, and chairman of its executive committee. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization, and was a member of several scientific advisory boards. He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the board of directors. He was also recruited by Michael D. West, founder of Geron () and current CEO of BioTime, to join the company&#x27;s Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991–2000. Hayflick was also a consultant at Genentech from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years. He developed their technology for growing animal cells in fermentation tanks in which most of their products were produced.

Hayflick was one of several prominent biologists featured in the 1995 science documentary &quot;Death by Design: The Life and Times of Life and Times&quot;.

Hayflick died in Sea Ranch, California, on August 1, 2024, at the age of 96.

== Research ==

Hayflick is known for his research in cell biology, virus vaccine development, and mycoplasmology. In 1962 he discovered that, contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, cultured normal human and animal cells have a limited capacity for replication. This discovery, known as the Hayflick limit, overturned a long-held belief bolstered by Alexis Carrel&#x27;s work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture. Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering what replication level they are at. He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal, to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.

Hayflick developed the first normal human diploid cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and aneuploid. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called WI-38, has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.

Hayflick produced the first oral polio vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines produced throughout the world including those for poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick&#x27;s original WI-38.

Hayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (&quot;walking pneumonia&quot;) in humans. The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a mycoplasma, a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms. The etiological agent was named by him as &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.

Hayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the International Association of Gerontology, and the Presidential Award from The International Organization for Mycoplasmology. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious John Scott Award in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.

In the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by Geron founder Michael D. West to join the company&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Board. In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Société de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal by the British Society for Research on Ageing. The American Aging Association established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his &quot;...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells...&quot; A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the Friedrich Schiller University in 2013.

Hayflick was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology. Hayflick is the author of over 275 scientific papers, book chapters and edited books of which four papers are among the 100 most cited scientific papers of the two million papers published in the basic biomedical sciences from 1961 to 1978.

The inverted microscope that Hayflick modified for use in his tissue culture and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

<doc id="482991" wikidata="Q453827" url="?curid=482991" title="Eileen Farrell">
<text>Eileen Farrell (February 13, 1920 – March 23, 2002) was an American soprano who had a nearly 60-year-long career performing both classical and popular music in concerts, theatres, on radio and television, and on disc. NPR noted, &quot;She possessed one of the largest and most radiant operatic voices of the 20th century.&quot; While she was active as an opera singer, her concert engagements far outnumbered her theatrical appearances. Her career was mainly based in the United States, although she did perform internationally. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that she &quot;was one of the finest American sopranos of the 20th century; she had a voice of magnificent proportions which she used with both acumen and artistry in a wide variety of roles.&quot; And described as having a voice &quot;like some unparalleled phenomenon of nature. She is to singers what Niagara is to waterfalls.&quot;

Farrell began her career in 1940 as a member of the CBS Chorus on CBS Radio. In 1941 CBS Radio offered Farrell her own program, &quot;Eileen Farrell Sings&quot;, on which she performed both classical and popular music for 5 years. In 1947 she launched her career as a concert soprano and nine years later began performing on the opera stage. The pinnacle of her opera career was five seasons performing at the Metropolitan Opera from 1960 to 1966. She continued to perform and record both classical and popular music throughout her career, and is credited for releasing the first successful crossover album: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Right to Sing the Blues&quot; (1960). After announcing her retirement from performance in 1986, she still continued to perform and record music periodically up into the late 1990s. She was also active as a voice teacher, both privately and for nine years at Indiana University.

==Early life and education==
Farrell was born in Willimantic, Connecticut, the youngest of three children born to Irish American Catholics Michael Farrell and Catherine Farrell (née Kennedy). Her parents were vaudeville singers who had performed under the name &#x27;The Singing O&#x27;Farrells&#x27; prior to having children. The family moved quite frequently during Farrell&#x27;s childhood to various towns in Connecticut. Eileen&#x27;s first clear memories were of her family&#x27;s home in Storrs, Connecticut which was where her parents were working as teachers of music and drama at Storrs Agricultural College (now the University of Connecticut).

When Farrell was five years old, her family moved back to Willimantic. After she attended first grade there, her family moved once again to Norwich, Connecticut, after her mother obtained the post of organist at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in that city. The family remained in Norwich for almost the next 10 years, with Farrell completing her freshman year of high school at Norwich Free Academy in 1935. The family then moved to Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and Farrell entered Woonsocket High School in Fall 1936. She graduated from the school in 1939.

Farrell received her early vocal training from her parents during her childhood. Her mother, a talented coloratura soprano, was her primary teacher, but her father, a baritone, also occasionally taught her. Miss Farrell&#x27;s early singing career was greatly encouraged by her local pastor, Father Cornelius J. Holland, at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. After graduating from high school, she moved to New York City in August 1939 to study with retired Metropolitan Opera contralto Merle Alcock. While studying singing with Alcock, she received language coaching from Charlie Baker, who was the music director of Rutgers Presbyterian Church. After working with him for a few months, he hired her as a paid singer at Rutgers. When her radio career took off, Baker became Farrell&#x27;s vocal coach and helped her prepare most of her music. In her autobiography, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing: The Life of Eileen Farrell&quot; (1999), she credits Baker with helping her succeed during the early years of her career on radio. Farrell later was a student of vocal and opera coach Eleanor McLellan, whom she credited for giving her a solid technique.

==Early career in radio==
In 1940 Farrell began her career as a member of the CBS Chorus. After three months with the chorus, CBS offered her a weekly half-hour radio program, &quot;Eileen Farrell Sings&quot; (also sometimes called &quot;Eileen Farrell Presents&quot;), on which she would perform both classical and popular music accompanied by the CBS Orchestra under conductor Howard Barlow. The program was coordinated by music director Jim Fassett and was mostly recorded at what is now the Ed Sullivan Theater. On the program she got to sing with several notable guest artists, including Margaret Harshaw, Frank Sinatra, Martial Singher, and Risë Stevens. The program first aired in early 1941 and quickly became popular. It ran through 1946.

While singing on her own program, Farrell also appeared as a guest on several other radio programs. She was a regular guest on Andre Kostelanetz&#x27;s &quot;The Pause That Refreshes&quot; and Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to Music&quot;. She also made appearances on &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, &quot;The Prudential Family Hour&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Centuries&quot;, and &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; among others. In 1944 she made a special Christmas recording that was for the American soldiers stationed abroad during World War II, with Shirley Temple as mistress of ceremonies.

==Concert and opera career==
During 1947–1948, she toured the US as a concert singer, and in 1949 she toured South America.

Farrell&#x27;s song recital in New York in October 1950 was enthusiastically acclaimed and gained her immediate recognition. That year, she also appeared in a concert performance of Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; as Marie. In 1952, she was engaged by Arturo Toscanini for his first and only RCA Victor studio recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra.

In the 1955 film &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot;, which starred Eleanor Parker as Australian soprano Marjorie Lawrence, Eileen Farrell supplied the singing voice. As early as 1956 she appeared before an audience of over 13,000 under the direction of the conductor Alfredo Antonini in a performance of arias from Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot; at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.

In 1956, she made her stage debut as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; with the San Carlo Opera in Tampa, Florida. In 1957 she debuted with the Lyric Opera of Chicago; in 1958, with the San Francisco Opera. She made her Metropolitan Opera debut on December 6, 1960, singing the title role in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;. She opened the 1962–63 Met season as Maddalena in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, opposite Franco Corelli. She remained on the Met roster through the 1963–64 season, singing forty-four performances in six roles, then returned in March 1966 for two final performances as Maddalena. Her other roles at the Met included the title role in Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, Isabella in de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Atlàntida&quot;, and Santuzza.

Farrell was equally at home singing pop material and opera. She recorded four albums of popular music for Columbia Records: &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Right to Sing the Blues&quot;, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;This Fling Called Love&quot; and &quot;Together with Love&quot;.

Throughout the 1960s she was a frequent soloist with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein; she was also a favorite of Thomas Schippers. With Eugene Ormandy, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, she was a featured soloist in an abridged recording of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. The other featured soloists were Martha Lipton, Davis Cunningham and William Warfield.

From 1971 to 1980, Farrell was professor of music at the Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington. From 1983 to 1985, she was professor of music at the University of Maine in Orono. She also made several recordings of blues music late in her career, as well as a well-received duet with Frank Sinatra on his &quot;&quot; album (1979), in which they sang a version of the country music hit &quot;For the Good Times&quot;. This introduced her to a new group of fans, especially Sinatra expert Charles Fasciano, who considered this song his personal favorite. She published a memoir, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing,&quot; in 1999.

Beginning in 1987 she began to record pop albums again. Her first was for the Audiophile label called &quot;With Much Love&quot;. She later recorded several albums for the Reference label that were well received.

Farrell was married to a New York Police Department officer, Robert Vincent Reagan, with whom she maintained homes in the Grymes Hill and Emerson Hill areas of Staten Island, New York. They had a son and daughter. He died in 1986. She was elected to Woonsocket&#x27;s Hall of Fame. A resident of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, Farrell died at a nursing home in Park Ridge, New Jersey, on March 23, 2002, aged 82.

<doc id="482992" wikidata="Q5138007" url="?curid=482992" title="Coalition to Stop Gun Violence">
<text>The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) and the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence (EFSGV or Ed Fund), its sister organization, were two parts of a national, non-profit gun control advocacy organization opposed to gun violence. Since 1974, it supported reduction in American gun violence via education and legislation. They ceased operations in 2022 after the EFSGV merged with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy to become the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins]] Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

==History==
In 1974, the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns, a group of thirty affiliated religious, labor, and nonprofit organizations, with the goal of addressing &quot;the high rates of gun-related crime and death in American society&quot; by requiring licensing of gun owners, registering firearms, and banning private ownership of handguns. &quot;Reasonable limited exceptions&quot; were to be allowed for “police, military, licensed security guards, antique dealers who have guns in unfireable condition, and licensed pistol clubs where firearms are kept on the premises.” In the 1980s and 1990s, the coalition expanded to 44 member groups.

In 1989, following the Cleveland Elementary School shooting in Stockton, California, the National Coalition to Ban Handguns changed its name to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, in part because the group believed that assault weapons as well as handguns, should be outlawed.

In 2022, the EFSGV merged with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy to become the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

==Mission==
According to CSGV, its mission was: &quot;We believe that all Americans have a right to live in communities free from gun violence. We pursue this goal through policy development, strategic engagement, and effective advocacy.&quot; The organization had nine areas of focus, regarding issues and campaigns:

# Opposition to the National Rifle Association&#x27;s interpretation of Second Amendment rights.
# Support for firearm microstamping, a ballistic identification technology intended to allow law enforcement to trace the serial number of a firearm from ejected cartridge cases recovered from crime scenes. 
# Ban the private sale of guns by instituting universal background checks.
# Ban concealed carry.
# Opposition to the sale of what it classifies as assault weapons to private citizens.
# Support for &quot;countermarketing&quot;, a strategy intended to force changes in gun industry&#x27;s marketing and distribution practices.
# Opposition to removing the duty to retreat in self-defense law (i.e., stand your ground laws).
# Support for stricter mental health screening for firearm purchases.
# Support for the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

<doc id="482995" wikidata="Q1326950" url="?curid=482995" title="List of bridges to the Island of Montreal">
<text>Like most major cities, Montreal needs easy highway access from its suburbs and surrounding areas. However, because Montreal was built on an island surrounded by three rivers, it can be entered by land only on a bridge or through a tunnel. Although the city was founded in 1642, it was not until 1847 that the first fixed link to the outside was established when a wooden bridge was built across Rivière des Prairies to Île Jésus, on the site of what is now Ahuntsic Bridge. Another bridge was built immediately afterward, a few kilometers west, which became Lachapelle Bridge, and another in 1849, Pont des Saints-Anges, to the east. The latter bridge collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt.

With the advent of the railroad, Montreal got a fixed link to the mainland; in 1854 railroad bridges were built in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, across both channels of the Ottawa River, linking Montreal Island to Ontario and the Vaudreuil-Soulanges peninsula through Perrot Island. In 1860, Montreal got its first link to the South Shore with the construction of Victoria Bridge, which was, at the time of its opening, the longest bridge in the world. Indirect links to the North Shore also had to wait for railroad construction, but this took longer; the Canadian Pacific Railway opened its link to Saint-Jérôme in 1876, through Île Jésus.

==Crossings==
This list of bridges and other fixed links serving the Island of Montreal proceeds counter-clockwise around the island from southwest, at the exit of Lake Saint-Louis, downstream along the St. Lawrence River, then upstream along Rivière des Prairies all the way to Lake of Two Mountains, then downstream again along the East Channel of the Ottawa River until it reaches Lake Saint-Louis. The year of construction is that of the structure currently in place, accompanied by the year of construction of the original structure if the current one replaced an older span.

=== Spanning the Saint Lawrence River and Saint Lawrence Seaway ===
The crossing of the Saint Lawrence River has always proved problematic for engineers due to width, depth, currents, and ice cover. The construction of Victoria Bridge for the Grand Trunk Railway, which, at , was the longest bridge in the world when it first opened in 1860, highlighted the problems presented by this natural obstacle. Not to be outdone by its rival, however, the Canadian Pacific Railway built its own span, the Saint-Laurent Railway Bridge, upstream from the Lachine Rapids in 1886
for which the Mohawks of Kahnawake were hired to erect the steel superstructure. Although Victoria Bridge was also used as a road crossing since 1898, it was not before the 1930s that two fully dedicated road bridges, Jacques-Cartier and Mercier, were built. More spans, including Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel and Champlain Bridge, were built in the 1960s. No new span was built for over 50 years, until a replacement Champlain Bridge was constructed at the cost of several billion dollars. It opened in 2019, while the previous span was closed to traffic to be demolished.

The construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s required extensive modifications for all spans that existed at the time. Those are not reflected in the table below.

=== Spanning the Rivière des Prairies ===
Although the Rivière des Prairies is much smaller than the Saint Lawrence, bridge construction there did not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now Laval, one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt. The existence of regular ferry services across the river is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad across the river was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to Laval that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately rebuilt.) The highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges across the river, and the upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.

=== Spanning the Lake of Two Mountains and the Ottawa River East Channel ===
The first railway bridge to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk Railway bridge across the Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built simultaneously across the West Channel, this bridge provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It was not until 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built across the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Île Perrot was the only way out of Montreal to the West before the construction of Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which goes directly to Vaudreuil across the Lake of Two Mountains.

All three spans across the Ottawa River East Channel are twinned by another span, built simultaneously, across the West Channel.

==Notes==
:The section of Honoré-Mercier bridge spanning over the St. Lawrence Seaway was rebuilt to seaway standards in the 1950s. The bridge was twinned by an identical one, on the downriver side, which opened in 1963.

:The Champlain Bridge Ice Structure, known in French as &quot;l&#x27;Estacade Champlain,&quot; was built to control ice floes coming from the Laprairie Basin.

:At the north end of Champlain Bridge, two spans, one north-south (aut. 15 and 20) and one east-west (aut. 10) connect Île des Sœurs to I. of Montreal. These two spans, called Pont Île-des-Sœurs and Pont Clément, are part of the Champlain Bridge complex.

:Victoria Bridge was built as a one-track tubular bridge which opened in 1860. It was the first bridge to cross the St. Lawrence River, and the longest bridge in the world. It was rebuilt as a two-track truss bridge in 1898. The South Y approach was rebuilt around the Saint-Lambert locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1961.

:Pont de la Concorde (Concorde Bridge) and Pont des Îles &quot;(&quot;Bridge of the Islands&quot;)&quot; were built for Expo 67. Pont de la Concorde connects Montreal Island to Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, while Pont des Îles connects Saint Helen&#x27;s Island to Notre-Dame Island.

:Jacques-Cartier Bridge was originally named &quot;Harbour Bridge/Pont du Havre&quot;, and renamed after Jacques Cartier in 1934 (400th anniversary of Cartier&#x27;s first voyage). The section over the St. Lawrence Seaway was lifted to a new height in 1962.

:The Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine complex consists of a tunnel from Montreal to Île Charron and a bridge from Île Charron to the South Shore.

:Construction of the Highway 25 Bridge started in early 2008 and was finished in May 2011. It is a toll bridge.

:The Rivière des Prairies hydro complex is a set of three dams: one from Montreal I. to Île de la Visitation (west of the Papineau-Leblanc Bridge), which includes a footpath; another between Île de la Visitation and Île du Cheval de Terre; and the longest span between Île du Cheval-de-Terre and Île Jésus. Île de la Visitation is joined to Montreal by another two small bridges: a road bridge, which also serves as a dam (historically, a water mill) and a footbridge.

:The railway crossing at Île Bigras consists of two spans, one north and one south of Île Bigras.

:A structure known as &quot;Île Bray Bridge&quot; was abandoned while still under construction in favor of Île aux Tourtes Bridge.

:Galipeault Bridge was first built in 1925 and doubled in 1964. Both spans have been replaced since. Taschereau Bridge, which was part of the same project, spans the West Channel along the same highway.

<text>The New Brunswick New Democratic Party (NB NDP; ) is a social democratic political party in New Brunswick, Canada. It is the provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party.

==History==
===Origins and early history===
The origins of the New Brunswick NDP can be traced back to the establishment of the Fredericton Socialist League in 1902. Prominent leaders within the movement included poet and publisher Martin Butler, as well as educator Henry Harvey Stuart, who formed a Fredericton local of the new Socialist Party of Canada in 1905. The SPC had several branches in the province prior to the First World War. Stuart was later a supporter of independent labour candidates, who had two successful candidates in Northumberland County in the 1920 provincial election. Additionally, nine Farmer candidates were elected that year. A strong believer in building alliances among the province&#x27;s social movements, Stuart was later an influential figure in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation to the time of his death in 1952.

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a social-democratic and democratic socialist federal political party, was organized at Calgary in 1932. A detailed platform, known as the Regina Manifesto, was adopted the following year. In New Brunswick, supporters of the new party convinced the New Brunswick Federation of Labour to sponsor a founding convention for the New Brunswick Section of the CCF. This took place at Moncton in June 1933, with party leader J.S. Woodsworth in attendance. Harry Girvan of Coal Creek was elected president.

The New Brunswick CCF was slow to become established on the provincial political scene. It ran only one candidate in the 1939 election, Joseph C. Arrowsmith in the riding of Saint John City, winning 712 votes. The fortunes of the New Brunswick CCF rose in tandem with growing expectations for postwar social reform and the rising fortunes of the national CCF, including the election of the CCF in Saskatchewan in 1944. Under the leadership of J. A. Mugridge, a trade unionist and the chief electrician at the Saint John Drydock and Shipbuilding Company, the CCF won 11.7 percent of the vote in New Brunswick&#x27;s 1944 provincial election. The best results were in Edmundston, Saint John, and Moncton, which had large numbers of union members. In that election, the CCF described itself as &quot;the People&#x27;s Party&quot;, running on a twelve-point program that included public ownership and full development of all natural resources including electricity, oil and gas and other public utilities.

The 1944 election proved to be an electoral high-point for the CCF in New Brunswick. A combination of anti-CCF propaganda, the increasing adoption of somewhat progressive policies by the New Brunswick Liberals and Conservatives, and a general trend of post-war decline for the CCF nationally all contributed to weaken the New Brunswick CCF in the 1948 provincial election. This time under Arrowsmith&#x27;s leadership, they received half the votes they had won in 1944 and again won no seats. In the 1952 provincial election, the CCF ran only 12 candidates and received only 1.3% of the vote and no seats. The CCF ran no candidates in the 1956 and 1960 provincial elections.

===The NDP to 1988===
The New Brunswick CCF retired from the scene to give way to the New Democratic Party (NDP), which was founded in 1961 as a Canadian social- democratic party with strong ties to organized labour, especially the Canadian Labour Congress, which was instrumental in founding the new party. At the provincial level, the New Brunswick NDP was organized in December 1962. Prospects were not good during the 1960s, however, as the province&#x27;s new Liberal premier, Louis J. Robichaud, was a left-of-centre populist politician who won three successive provincial elections and introduced significant social reforms. The New Brunswick NDP did not run candidates in the 1963 provincial election and ran only three candidates in the 1967 provincial election.

In 1971, a party convention narrowly endorsed a manifesto proposed by the New Brunswick Waffle, a local group loosely related to the minority wing of the federal NDP known as The Waffle, which was known for advocating stronger socialist and nationalist policies. The federal NDP responded to the New Brunswick upset by temporarily dissolving the provincial NDP until non-Waffle leadership was re-established with the reinstatement of J. Albert Richardson. The Waffle episode had the effect of promoting greater labour involvement in the party, for fear that the party would fall under the sway of more radical supporters without it.

During the late 1970s, under the leadership of John LaBossiere, the party increasingly adopted policy positions that reflected feminist and environmentalist concerns, including opposition to aerial spruce budworm spraying and the construction of the Point Lepreau nuclear plant. These initiatives attracted new supporters while also weakening relations with some labour supporters. The party also saw its membership grow and its organizational abilities improve during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Along with promoting traditional social-democratic NDP policies, the party also attacked government patronage and poor fiscal management.

Relations with organized labour and the women&#x27;s movement improved further after George Little became party leader in 1980. During Little&#x27;s time as leader, in the 1982 New Brunswick election the party won its first-ever seat in Tantramar, with the election of Robert Hall to the legislature. A second seat was won in a 1984 by-election in East Saint John, but Peter Trites left to join the Liberals before the next election. The New Brunswick NDP ran a full slate of candidates for the first time in the 1987 campaign. The period saw increasing popular support (surpassing 10% for the first time) and rising membership totals, numbering over 1,000 by the mid-1980s. However, the party failed to win any seats in 1987, due to the tidal wave of support for Frank McKenna and the Liberals, who won more than 60% of the vote and took 100% of the seats in the legislature. Little stepped down from the leadership in 1988. Robert Hall served as interim leader until a leadership conference was held.

===Elizabeth Weir (1988–2005)===
In June 1988, Elizabeth Weir, the party&#x27;s former provincial secretary, was elected as the party&#x27;s new leader. After the one-sided 1987 election, Premier McKenna allowed leaders of the unrepresented parties to ask questions in the legislature and in the public accounts committee. Weir took full advantage of the opportunity, using her training as a lawyer and her speaking skills to needle the government. Her media presence and political stature increased significantly, and she was sometimes referred to by cabinet ministers as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition. In the 1991 provincial election, Weir won a seat in Saint John South, making her the first provincial NDP leader to be elected to the legislature. She was re-elected in the new constituency of Saint John Harbour in the 1995 provincial election, running against a star Liberal candidate. Weir won re-election twice more after this.

During her time in the legislature, Weir proved a strong critic of McKenna&#x27;s neo-liberal policies, successfully attacking public-private partnerships such as a plan to have a youth detention centre built and operated by an American corporation. She was also an ally of organized labour in resisting legislated wage freezes that were directed at public sector employees. She promoted the expansion of union rights through legislation to prohibit the use of replacement workers in strikes. At the request of organized labour, Weir introduced the Workers Mourning Day Act, enacted in 2000, which established 28 April as an annual day of recognition for workers killed or injured in the workplace. In other areas, she addressed issues such as women&#x27;s rights, pay equity, environmental protection, poverty and the rights of social assistance recipients. During her last term, she was successful in gaining the support of an all-party committee for public automobile insurance.

Despite Weir&#x27;s personal popularity and her ability to attract strong candidates, she was not able to add extra seats to the party caucus. This was especially disappointing in light of the election of Yvon Godin as a federal NDP Member of Parliament in Acadie-Bathurst in 1997; he ultimately served five terms in Parliament. In 2004, Weir announced her plan to step down as leader and also resigned her seat after a new leader was chosen the following year.

===Challenges (2005–2017)===
The period immediately following Weir&#x27;s departure was a difficult one for the party. Allison Brewer was elected as party leader in September 2005, but faced challenges due to her inability to speak French and her lack of experience in electoral politics. In the 2006 provincial election the NDP failed to run a full slate and saw their popular vote collapse. Brewer resigned soon after the election. Pat Hanratty stood in as interim leader.

He was replaced by Roger Duguay in 2007. Duguay&#x27;s tenure as leader was dominated by a shakeup in the party&#x27;s internal operations. Much of the old executive of the party was replaced in 2009 and a new team of modernizers began to gain prominence within the party. During the 2010 provincial election the party platform combined traditional progressive social policy, education and health spending with a greater emphasis on the need for fiscal prudence and balanced budgets and cutting wasteful government spending, including opposition to corporate welfare. The party more than doubled its share of the vote, returning to the levels achieved under Little and Weir, but no candidate, including Duguay, won a seat. He resigned as leader in November 2010.

Following Duguay&#x27;s resignation, Jesse Travis was named interim leader, and a leadership race was scheduled for 2011. When one of the two candidates, Pierre Cyr, was disqualified and withdrew, the party&#x27;s former campaign director Dominic Cardy was acclaimed as party leader. In a leadership review at the 2012 party convention, Cardy was endorsed by 82% of the voting members. He then continued the process of changing the party&#x27;s policies and organization, in line with the Third Way model associated with former British prime minister Tony Blair, whom Cardy admired.

By 2014, however, Cardy&#x27;s political strategy was attracting criticism, especially on issues of policies on resource development in forestry, oil pipelines and shale gas. Concerns increased when Cardy recruited several prominent former Conservative and Liberal politicians as candidates for the 2014 election. These factors contributed to the defection of some NDP supporters, including former leader Allison Brewer, to the Green Party of New Brunswick, who were successful in electing David Coon in Fredericton South. The NDP received 13% of the vote in the September 22, 2014 provincial election, a record high in votes. Although Cardy came within 500 votes of winning in his constituency, the party failed to win any seats.

Cardy announced plans to resign at the next party convention, but this was suspended to enable him to run in an unexpected byelection in Saint John East in November 2014, though without success. The party executive subsequently encouraged him to continue as leader. Criticism of Cardy&#x27;s policies and leadership style increased, with concerns expressed by veteran leaders such as federal NDP MP Yvon Godin and Daniel Légère, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, New Brunswick. Complaining of party infighting, Cardy resigned both as leader and as a party member on 1 January 2017. Later that month, he announced that he was joining the Progressive Conservatives under party leader Blaine Higgs as a member of his staff. He subsequently was appointed to cabinet when Higgs&#x27;s PCs formed government.

===Jennifer McKenzie (2017–2019)===
On 10 August 2017, Jennifer McKenzie of St. Martins, a rural community east of Saint John, was confirmed as the new leader of the party. Before returning to New Brunswick, she served as chair of the public school board in Ottawa, Ontario. In the 2015 federal election, she ran as a candidate in Fundy-Royal, finishing in third place with 17.5% of the votes. An electrical engineer and tech entrepreneur by background, McKenzie ran for the NDP leadership on a pledge to bring the party back to its traditions of advancing social, environmental and economic justice. Outgoing interim leader Rosaire L&#x27;Italien described the change as a &quot;rebirth&quot; of the party and welcomed previously alienated party members to return. &quot;I am a socialist and I believe in the power of people working together,&quot; McKenzie stated at a press conference, &quot;I hope to take this party into the future based on the solid principles on which the New Democrats are founded.&quot; Among the party&#x27;s planks for the 2018 election were plans to reduce university tuition and to eliminate community college tuition fees, plans to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and plans to roll out a universal daycare and after school program run by school districts. Under McKenzie&#x27;s leadership, the party registered between 5% and 13% support in the polls. More than half the party&#x27;s candidates in 2018 were women, making the NDP the only political party to achieve this level. On election night, however, the NDP was eclipsed on the left by the Green Party, whose supporters included many former NDP voters. The party received 5% of the vote and was reduced to fifth place, behind the Greens and the People&#x27;s Alliance of New Brunswick, who each elected three members. McKenzie placed third in Saint John Harbour, with 14.7% of the vote, slightly ahead of the Green candidate. At a party meeting on 24 February 2019, delegates voted narrowly in favour of holding a leadership convention. The following day, McKenzie stated she did not intend to run in the contest and announced her resignation.

=== Decline (2019–present) ===
In March 2019, party representatives chose 21-year-old Mackenzie Thomason, a candidate in New Maryland-Sunbury in the preceding election, as interim leader. A leadership convention was planned for August 2019, but was cancelled due to a lack of acceptable candidates.

Prospects for renewal continued to be discouraging when it was announced, in a joint statement on 3 September, that fourteen candidates who ran for the NDP in the 2018 provincial election were joining the Greens. Within days, however, five of those candidates denied they were leaving the NDP and said they believed they were supporting a merger of the two parties. Green Party leader David Coon apologized for failing to confirm the decision with each of the fourteen candidates before welcoming them into his party as a group. He also said there had been no formal discussion of a merger of the two parties. A news story later revealed that one of the candidates who led the move to leave the NDP had failed to qualify for the party leadership contest.

In November 2019, the party announced plans for a new leadership race, with the decision set for 14 June 2020. In April 2020, however, party president Cyprien Okana announced a decision to postpone the convention due to the emergency conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thomason then led the party into a snap provincial election held on 14 September 2020. There were 33 candidates, many of them youthful, but none were elected and the party’s vote share dropped below two percent, the lowest since 1967. Thomason resigned as interim leader on 15 November 2020, and was quickly succeeded by party communications director Nathan Davis, who stepped down almost immediately, citing a change in circumstances following a family emergency.

On 12 December, the party chose a new interim leader, 25-year-old Chris Thompson of Fredericton. On 14 September 2021, Thomason returned to the leadership, this time on a permanent basis, by acclamation.
In May 2022, ahead of two by-elections in which the NDP failed to nominate candidates, the CBC reported that Thomason had lost a non-binding confidence vote by the party&#x27;s executive council. Several weeks later, on 14 June, Thomason announced that due to internal dissension he was resigning the leadership, reluctantly, with effect from 28 June. A longstanding party member from Saint John, Alex White, was subsequently named interim leader, with a party convention expected to choose a new leader in July. According to a newsletter released by the party in May 2023, plans were changed, with a convention scheduled for 30 September 2023. However, as only one candidate registered, interim leader Alex White was acclaimed the party&#x27;s new permanent leader on 11 August. In the October 2024 election, which returned a new Liberal government, the NDP ran 23 candidates for the 49 seats. Although the party finished in third place in several ridings, they were reduced to fourth place overall, with 1.3 per cent of the provincial vote, easily eclipsed by the Green Party as the province&#x27;s third party.

==Election results==
==NDP members of the NB Legislative Assembly==
There are currently no New Democrats in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. In the past, three separate individuals have been elected as New Democrats and they are as follows:
*Robert Hall, Tantramar; 1982 to his defeat in the 1987 election
*Peter Trites, East Saint John; 1984 by-election until joining the Liberals in 1986
*Elizabeth Weir, Saint John South (1991–1995), Saint John Harbour (1995–2005); 1991 to 2005

The NDP&#x27;s predecessor, the CCF never won a seat in the New Brunswick legislature. In the 1920 general election nine United Farmers and two Farmer-Labour MLAs were elected.

<text>The true soles are a family, Soleidae, of flatfishes. It includes saltwater and brackish water species in the East Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and West and Central Pacific Ocean. Freshwater species are found in Africa, southern Asia, New Guinea, and Australia.

In the past, soles of the Americas (both fresh and salt water) were included in this family, but they have been separated to their own family, the American soles (Achiridae). The only true sole remaining in that region is &quot;Aseraggodes herrei&quot; of the Galápagos and Cocos Island.

The true soles are bottom-dwelling fishes feeding on small crustaceans and other invertebrates. The family contains 30 genera and a total of about 180 species.

Soles begin life as bilaterally symmetric larvae, with an eye on each side of the head, but during development, the left eye moves around onto the right side of the head. Adult soles lie on their left (blind) sides on the sea floor, often covered in mud, which in combination with their dark colours, makes them hard to spot.

A flatfish resembling a small halibut or sole was observed by the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; at the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a depth around . This observation has been questioned by fish experts, and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid.

Many soles are important food species: the common sole, &quot;Solea solea&quot;, is popular in northern Europe and the Mediterranean.

The earliest known fossil remains of soles are indeterminate otoliths from the Early Eocene-aged London Clay. During the Middle Eocene (Lutetian), the first fossil skeletons of soles are known in &quot;Eobuglossus&quot; and &quot;Turahbuglossus&quot; from Egypt.

<doc id="483001" wikidata="Q356654" url="?curid=483001" title="Mario Cipollini">
<text>Mario Cipollini (; born 22 March 1967), often abbreviated to Cipo, is a retired Italian professional road cyclist most noted for his sprinting ability, the longevity of his dominance (his first pro win came in 1988, his last in 2005; 170 professional wins, 192 including criteriums), and his colourful personality. His nicknames include &quot;Il Re Leone&quot; (The Lion King) and &quot;Super Mario&quot;. He is regarded as having been the best sprinter of his generation.

His career highlights include the Road World Championships and Milan–San Remo in 2002, and 42 stages in the Giro d&#x27;Italia. He also won 12 stages in the Tour de France and three stages in the Vuelta a España.

==Career==

Cipollini was born in San Giusto di Compito, surrounded by the mountains of Capannori south of Lucca, Tuscany. He came from a cycling family – his father, Vivaldo, had been a successful amateur racer in his youth, whilst his brother Cesare had raced as a professional and his sister Tiziana had also competed as a cyclist. Mario was a prolific winner in his youth career, scoring a total of 125 victories in age group and amateur races before joining the professional peloton in 1989.

In the 1999 Tour de France, he led the peloton on the fastest stage in the history of the Tour, averaging more than 50 km/h over 194.5 km. In the same Tour, he won 4 stages in a row, setting the post-World War II record for consecutive stage wins. He has also found success in Belgium, winning Gent–Wevelgem in 1992, 1993 and 2002 (record).

At the peak of his career, Cipollini&#x27;s speed was unrivaled, and he is credited with being the first rider with a sprint train. The red jerseys of his team, featuring team-mates such as Paolo Fornaciari, Giuseppe Calcaterra, Gian Matteo Fagnini and Mario Scirea, were commonly seen at the front of the peloton toward the end of the flat Grand Tour stages in the late 1990s. The train kept the pace high in the closing kilometers, to dissuade opposing riders from attacking and to ensure that in the final 200–300 meters, Cipollini was the only cyclist able to maintain the speed. This changed the way teams approached mass sprints and bred a new generation of sprinters, such as fellow Italian Alessandro Petacchi.

The beginning of 2002 saw Cipollini win Milan–San Remo with his new Acqua-Sapone team, and later Gent–Wevelgem. However, a falling-out with the organizers of the Tour de France made him announce his retirement. Italian national coach Franco Ballerini convinced him to return to competition, and built the Italian national team around Cipollini for the 2002 UCI Road World Championships. Cipollini won the rainbow jersey in a sprint finish in Zolder, Belgium.

In the 2003 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Cipollini focused on Alfredo Binda&#x27;s record 41 Giro stage wins while in the world champion&#x27;s jersey. His attempt was almost derailed by Alessandro Petacchi of the Fassa Bortolo team. After many failed attempts, he finally broke the record, although he had to abandon the next stage due to injuries in a crash on a rain-soaked finish. He said that the crash ended his career. His team, Domina Vacanze-Elitron, was left out of the Tour de France that year, prompting a comment from Cipollini that the organisers disrespected the rainbow jersey. 

When he retired from the 2004 Giro due to another crash, it was the only time he entered the Giro without winning a single stage.

In 2008, he returned to competitive cycling with the Rock Racing team at the Tour of California.

===Retirement===
After having vowed to retire several times in his career, usually in a public fit of pique, Cipollini finally made good on his promise on 26 April 2005, one week before the start of the 2005 Giro. His swan song was to participate in a ceremonial prologue of the Giro wearing a fluorescent pink skin suit, which listed his 42-stage wins.

Cipollini emerged from retirement in early 2008, with Rock Racing. His first race back was the 2008 Tour of California, and he finished third on stage 2. On the eve of the Milan–San Remo, he announced that he would retire again, citing disagreements over his leadership role on Rock Racing.

==Controversies==
Cipollini made no secret that he did not like climbing stages, and while he completed all stages of the Giro on many occasions, he infuriated purists by not attempting mountain stages at the Tour or Vuelta. While this is a common practice with sprinters without points jersey aspirations so as to save themselves for the rest of the season, Cipollini&#x27;s practice of releasing photos of himself lounging at the beach while the others struggled in the mountains earned him more than his fair share of attention in this regard.

Cipollini also became famous for extravagant clothing, especially racing uniforms, sporting custom-made skin suits. Some of his memorable kits include a muscle suit, zebra, and tiger prints, and a techno-skinsuit inspired by the 1982 film &quot;Tron&quot;. Off the course, Cipollini and his Saeco squad dressed as ancient Romans during a rest day at the 1999 Tour de France, to celebrate Julius Caesar&#x27;s birthday and to commemorate Cipollini&#x27;s record fourth consecutive Tour de France stage win. He was fined for wearing an all-yellow outfit while leading the Tour de France; this practice to wear more yellow and even have a yellow bike has since become generally accepted.

These antics violated UCI regulations, which resulted in Cipollini and his team being fined thousands of Swiss francs. The muscle suit fetched 100 million lira (US$43,710) in a charity auction, nearly 100 times the fine. Some organisers, especially Jean-Marie Leblanc of the Tour de France, took offence at his hijinks and he wasn&#x27;t invited to race in the Tour from 2000 to 2003, despite being the world champion in 2003.

Cipollini was kicked out of the 2000 Vuelta a España after he punched Vitalicio Seguros rider Francisco Cerezo to the ground before the start of a stage. Later in 2003, he drew the ire of the organisers of the Vuelta a España when he quit after the prologue time trial. His team had been invited to compete with the condition that Cipollini participated. He said he was recovering from injury and should not have been forced to race in the first place.

In February 2013, news surfaced that Cipollini could have been a client of doctor Eufemiano Fuentes from 2001 to 2004. A report published by Italian newspaper &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; alleged that Cipollini&#x27;s codename was &quot;Maria&quot; and that he received various doping products, including injecting 25 blood bags from the beginning of 2003 to the start of the Giro d&#x27;Italia in May. Cipollini&#x27;s lawyer stated that the claims were false when the story was revealed on 9 February 2013.

His name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.

In June 2022, and following allegations of domestic violence and stalking, the public prosecutor of Lucca demanded a two and half years of prison sentence for Cipollini.
In October 2022, Cipollini was sentenced by the Lucca court to 3 years in prison and to compensate the civil party for 85 thousand euros.

==Personal life==
Cipollini&#x27;s powerful performances sometimes risked being eclipsed by his flamboyant manner and lifestyle. His height, looks and mane of hair earned him the nickname &quot;Lion King&quot;, and he adopted other names, including &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario the Magnificent.&quot; His wardrobe consisted of hundreds of suits, ties and shoes, many of which he never wore. In 2002, he was arrested for motorpacing on an Italian autostrada. He commented that it was the only place where he could safely get up to top speed for training. He responded to criticisms by claiming that he helped generate coverage for his sponsors, and that it was all part of his showmanship.

Cipollini married Sabrina Landucci in 1993. The couple separated in 2005. Despite being married through much of his career, Cipollini was regarded as a sex symbol and rumored to be a womaniser. He did little to dispel these notions with comments such as, &quot;If I weren&#x27;t a professional cyclist, I&#x27;d be a porn star&quot;.

Daniel Coyle&#x27;s book &quot;Lance Armstrong&#x27;s War&quot; says Cipollini&#x27;s profile was little more than a decoy. The intent was that competitors would find themselves distracted by the constant media coverage of Cipollini, and demoralised by the impression that he could party all night and beat them the next morning.

Despite this boisterous public image, Cipollini could often be quite humble regarding his fellow cyclists. After breaking Alfredo Binda&#x27;s record for Giro stage wins he remarked he would have been happy &quot;just to polish [Binda&#x27;s] shoes.&quot; Reacting to the 2004 death of Marco Pantani, Cipollini said, &quot;I am devastated. It&#x27;s a tragedy of enormous proportions for everyone involved in cycling. I&#x27;m lost for words.&quot;

In 2010 Cipollini started his own brand of bicycles which were used by the Italian team.

<text>ISABELLE (also known later as Colliding Beam Accelerator, CBA) was a 200+200 GeV proton–proton colliding beam particle accelerator partially built by the United States government at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, before it was cancelled in July, 1983.

==Colliding beam accelerators==
A colliding beam, storage ring accelerator was first proposed by Gerard O&#x27;Neill of Princeton in 1956, who built an electron-electron system beginning in 1957 (operational in 1962, first collisions in 1964) with assistance from Burton Richter, William C. Barber and Bernard Gittelman. The AdA accelerator, an electron-positron system, stored its first beam in 1961 at Frascati National Laboratories, Italy and was later moved to Orsay Laboratory, France, where in 1964 it recorded first e+e− collisions. 
At the same time, two colliding-beam experiments were conceived and built by Budker and his group at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk, Russia, Soviet Union: electron-electron VEP-1 (first collisions in 1964) and electron-positron VEPP-2 (first collisions in 1965).

 to build storage rings for a proton-proton colliding beam accelerator was considered at a summer study held at Brookhaven in 1963. The Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) facility at CERN, a 30+30 GeV proton-proton system, opened in 1971 and became the first high energy hadron collider. The SPEAR collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a 3+3 GeV electron-positron system, was completed in 1972 and soon contributed to discoveries of the ψ meson and τ lepton, both recognized in Nobel Prizes. The ψ had previously been found in a fixed-target experiment at the Brookhaven AGS, where it was called the J, but it was better measured with SPEAR.

==The ISABELLE project==
A design study for a proton storage ring system was completed at Brookhaven in 1973. In 1974 the U.S. High Energy Physics Advisory Panel recommended that ISABELLE (the Intersecting Storage Accelerator + &quot;belle&quot;) should be built at Brookhaven. It was to be a 200+200 GeV proton-proton system using superconducting magnets. New York politicians, spurred by the sometimes impetuous Sen. Moynihan, pushed through funding before development of magnet technology had been completed. Construction began in 1978. The following year a prototype magnet was successfully tested. In 1981, however, production models of magnets failed at less than the magnetic field intensity needed for operation.

Delays in the project led to competitive evaluation against a proposal for a much larger machine, eventually called the Superconducting Supercollider, a proton-proton system aimed at 20,000+20,000 GeV; while developments in Europe at CERN, including discovery of the W and Z bosons, appeared to make ISABELLE redundant. In July, 1983, the U.S. Department of Energy cancelled the ISABELLE project after spending more than US$200 million on it. Cancellation of ISABELLE accelerated the United States fall from dominance in high energy physics and proved a for the much more costly cancellation of the Superconducting Supercollider in October, 1993. After years of planning and development, parts of the tunnel, experimental hall and magnet infrastructure built for ISABELLE were salvaged and reused by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a US$617 million joint project of the U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation which was approved in 1991 and began operation in 2000.

<text>Potassium permanganate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula KMnO4. It is a purplish-black crystalline salt, which dissolves in water as K+ and  ions to give an intensely pink to purple solution.

Potassium permanganate is widely used in the chemical industry and laboratories as a strong oxidizing agent, and also as a medication for dermatitis, for cleaning wounds, and general disinfection. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2000, worldwide production was estimated at 30,000 tons.

==Properties==
Potassium permanganate is the potassium salt of the tetrahedral transition metal oxo complex permanganate, in which four ligands are bound to a manganese(VII) center.

===Structure===
 forms orthorhombic crystals with constants: &quot;a&quot; = 910.5 pm, &quot;b&quot; = 572.0 pm, &quot;c&quot; = 742.5 pm. The overall motif is similar to that for barium sulfate, with which it forms solid solutions. In the solid (as in solution), each centre is tetrahedral. The Mn–O distances are 1.62 Å.

===Color===
The purplish-black color of solid potassium permanganate, and the intensely pink to purple color of its solutions, is caused by its permanganate anion, which gets its color from a strong charge-transfer absorption band caused by excitation of electrons from oxo ligand orbitals to empty orbitals of the manganese(VII) center.

==Medical uses==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Potassium permanganate functions as a strong oxidising agent. Through this mechanism it results in disinfection, astringent effects, and decreased smell.

=== Clinical use ===
Potassium permanganate is used for a number of skin conditions. This includes fungal infections of the foot, impetigo, pemphigus, superficial wounds, dermatitis, and topical ulcers. Radioactive contamination of the skin can be cleaned with potassium permanganate and vigorous scrubbing. For topical ulcers it is used together with procaine benzylpenicillin. Typically it is used in skin conditions that produce a lot of liquid. It can be applied as a soaked dressing or a bath. It can be used in children and adults. Petroleum jelly may be used on the nails before soaking to prevent their discoloration. For treating eczema, it is recommended using for only a few days at a time due to the possibility of it irritating the skin.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not recommend its use in the crystal or tablet form. It should only be used in a diluted liquid form.

=== Historical use ===
Potassium permanganate was first made in the 1600s and came into common medical use at least as early as the 1800s. During World War I Canadian soldiers were given potassium permanganate (to be applied mixed with an ointment) in an effort to prevent sexually transmitted infections. Some have attempted to bring about an abortion by putting it in the vagina, though this is not effective. Other historical uses have included an effort to wash out the stomach in those with strychnine or picrotoxin poisoning.

=== Side effects ===
Side effects from topical use may include irritation of the skin and discoloration of clothing. A harsh burn on a child from an undissolved tablet has been reported. Higher concentration solutions can result in chemical burns. Therefore, the British National Formulary recommends 100 mg be dissolved in a liter of water before use to form a 1:10,000 (0.01%) solution. Wrapping the dressings soaked with potassium permanganate is not recommended.

Potassium permanganate is toxic if taken by mouth. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath may occur. If a sufficiently large amount (about 10 grams) is eaten death may occur.

Concentrated solutions when drunk have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome or swelling of the airway. Recommended measures for those who have ingested potassium permanganate include gastroscopy. Activated charcoal or medications to cause vomiting are not recommended. While medications like ranitidine and acetylcysteine may be used in toxicity, evidence for this use is poor.

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
In the United States the FDA requires tablets of the medication to be sold by prescription. Potassium permanganate, however, does not have FDA approved uses and therefore non medical grade potassium permanganate is sometimes used for medical purposes.[&quot;&quot;]

It is available under a number of brand names including Permasol, Koi Med Tricho-Ex, and Kalii permanganas RFF. It is occasionally called &quot;Condy&#x27;s crystals&quot;.

=== Veterinary medicine ===
Potassium permanganate may be used to prevent the spread of glanders among horses.

==Industrial and other uses==
Almost all applications of potassium permanganate exploit its oxidizing properties. As a strong oxidant that does not generate toxic byproducts, KMnO4 has many niche uses.
===Water treatment===
Potassium permanganate is used extensively in the water treatment industry. It is used as a regeneration chemical to remove iron and hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) from well water via a &quot;manganese greensand&quot; filter. &quot;Pot-Perm&quot; is also obtainable at pool supply stores and is used additionally to treat wastewater. Historically it was used to disinfect drinking water and can turn the water pink. Modern hiking and survivalist guides advise against using potassium permanganate in the field because it is difficult to dose correctly. It currently finds application in the control of nuisance organisms such as zebra mussels in fresh water collection and treatment systems.

===Synthesis of organic compounds===

A major application of KMnO4 is as a reagent for the synthesis of organic compounds. Significant amounts are required for the synthesis of ascorbic acid, chloramphenicol, saccharin, isonicotinic acid, and pyrazinoic acid.

KMnO4 is used in qualitative organic analysis to test for the presence of unsaturation. It is sometimes referred to as Baeyer&#x27;s reagent after the German organic chemist Adolf von Baeyer. The reagent is an alkaline solution of potassium permanganate. Reaction with double or triple bonds ( or ) causes the color to fade from purplish-pink to brown. Aldehydes and formic acid (and formates) also give a positive test. The test is antiquated.
KMnO4 solution is a common thin layer chromatography (TLC) stain for the detection of oxidizable functional groups, such as alcohols, aldehydes, alkenes, and ketones. Such compounds result in a white to orange spot on TLC plates.

===Analytical use===
Potassium permanganate can be used to quantitatively determine the total oxidizable organic material in an aqueous sample. The value determined is known as the &quot;permanganate value.&quot; In analytical chemistry, a standardized aqueous solution of KMnO4 is sometimes used as an oxidizing titrant for redox titrations (permanganometry). As potassium permanganate is titrated, the solution becomes a light shade of purple, which darkens as excess of the titrant is added to the solution. In a related way, it is used as a reagent to determine the Kappa number of wood pulp. For the standardization of KMnO4 solutions, reduction by oxalic acid is often used. In agricultural chemistry, it is used for estimation of active carbon in soil.

Aqueous, acidic solutions of KMnO4 are used to collect gaseous mercury in flue gas during stationary source emissions testing.

In histology, potassium permanganate was used as a bleaching agent.

===Fruit preservation===
Ethylene absorbents extend storage time of bananas even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing bananas in polyethylene together with potassium permanganate. By removing ethylene by oxidation, the permanganate delays the ripening, increasing the fruit&#x27;s shelf life up to 4 weeks without the need for refrigeration.

The chemical reaction, in which ethylene (C2H4) is oxidised by potassium permanganate (KMnO4) to carbon dioxide (CO2), manganese oxide (MnO2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), in the presence of water, is presented as follows:

3 C2H4 + 12 KMnO4 + 2 H2O → 6 CO2 + 2 H2O + 12 MnO2 + 12 KOH

===Survival kits===
Potassium permanganate is sometimes included in survival kits: as a hypergolic fire starter (when mixed with glycerol antifreeze from a car radiator); as a water sterilizer; and for creating distress signals on snow.

===Fire service===
Potassium permanganate is added to &quot;plastic sphere dispensers&quot; to create backfires, burnouts, and controlled burns. Polymer spheres resembling ping-pong balls containing small amounts of permanganate are injected with ethylene glycol and projected towards the area where ignition is desired, where they spontaneously ignite seconds later. Both handheld helicopter- unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or boat-mounted plastic sphere dispensers are used.

===Other uses===
Potassium permanganate is one of the principal chemicals used in the film and television industries to &quot;age&quot; props and set dressings. Its ready conversion to brown MnO2 creates &quot;hundred-year-old&quot; or &quot;ancient&quot; looks on hessian cloth (burlap), ropes, timber and glass.

Potassium permanganate can be used to oxidize cocaine paste to purify it and increase its stability. This led to the Drug Enforcement Administration launching Operation Purple in 2000, with the goal of monitoring the world supply of potassium permanganate; however, potassium permanganate derivatives and substitutes were soon used thereafter to avoid the operation.

Potassium permanganate is used as an oxidizing agent in the synthesis of cocaine and methcathinone.

Potassium permanganate is one of a number of possible treatments for &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; (commonly known as &quot;ich&quot;), a parasite that infects and usually kills freshwater aquarium fish.

==History==
In 1659, Johann Rudolf Glauber fused a mixture of the mineral pyrolusite (manganese dioxide, MnO2) and potassium carbonate to obtain a material that, when dissolved in water, gave a green solution (potassium manganate) which slowly shifted to violet and then finally red. The reaction that produced the color changes that Glauber observed in his solution of potassium permanganate and potassium manganate (K2MnO4) is now known as the &quot;chemical chameleon&quot;. This report represents the first description of the production of potassium permanganate. Just under 200 years later, London chemist Henry Bollmann Condy had an interest in disinfectants; he found that fusing pyrolusite with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dissolving it in water produced a solution with disinfectant properties. He patented this solution, and marketed it as &#x27;Condy&#x27;s Fluid&#x27;. Although effective, the solution was not very stable. This was overcome by using potassium hydroxide (KOH) rather than NaOH. This was more stable, and had the advantage of easy conversion to the equally effective potassium permanganate crystals. This crystalline material was known as &#x27;Condy&#x27;s crystals&#x27; or &#x27;Condy&#x27;s powder&#x27;. Potassium permanganate was comparatively easy to manufacture, so Condy was subsequently forced to spend considerable time in litigation to stop competitors from marketing similar products. According to Varlam Shalamov, potassium permanganate solution was used as a catch-all treatment for dysentery, frostbite and ulcers in the Gulag camps of Kolyma.

Early photographers used it as a component of flash powder. It is now replaced with other oxidizers, due to the instability of permanganate mixtures.

== Preparation ==
Potassium permanganate is produced industrially from manganese dioxide, which also occurs as the mineral pyrolusite. In 2000, worldwide production was estimated at 30,000 tonnes. The MnO2 is fused with potassium hydroxide and heated in air or with another source of oxygen, like potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate. This process gives potassium manganate:

With sodium hydroxide, the end product is not sodium manganate but an Mn(V) compound, which is one reason why the potassium permanganate is more commonly used than sodium permanganate. Furthermore, the potassium salt crystallizes better.

The potassium manganate is then converted into permanganate by electrolytic oxidation in alkaline media:

===Other methods===
Although of no commercial importance, potassium manganate can be oxidized by chlorine or by disproportionation under acidic conditions. The chlorine oxidation reaction is

and the acid-induced disproportionation reaction may be written as

A weak acid such as carbonic acid is sufficient for this reaction:

Permanganate salts may also be generated by treating a solution of Mn2+ ions with strong oxidants such as lead dioxide (PbO2), sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3), or peroxydisulfate. Tests for the presence of manganese exploit the vivid violet color of permanganate produced by these reagents.

==Reactions==
===Organic chemistry===
Dilute solutions of KMnO4 convert alkenes into diols. This behaviour is also used as a qualitative test for the presence of double or triple bonds in a molecule, since the reaction decolorizes the initially purple permanganate solution and generates a brown precipitate (MnO2). In this context, it is sometimes called &quot;Baeyer&#x27;s reagent&quot;. However, bromine serves better in measuring unsaturation (double or triple bonds) quantitatively, since KMnO4, being a very strong oxidizing agent, can react with a variety of groups.

Under acidic conditions, the alkene double bond is cleaved to give the appropriate carboxylic acid:

Potassium permanganate oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids, illustrated by the conversion of &quot;n&quot;-heptanal to heptanoic acid:

Even an alkyl group (with a benzylic hydrogen) on an aromatic ring is oxidized, e.g. toluene to benzoic acid.

Glycols and polyols are highly reactive toward KMnO4. For example, addition of potassium permanganate to an aqueous solution of sugar and sodium hydroxide produces the chemical chameleon reaction, which involves dramatic color changes associated with the various oxidation states of manganese. A related vigorous reaction is exploited as a fire starter in survival kits. For example, a mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerol or pulverized glucose ignites readily. Its sterilizing properties are another reason for inclusion of KMnO4 in a survival kit.

===Ion exchange===
Treating a mixture of aqueous potassium permanganate with a quaternary ammonium salt results in ion exchange, precipitating the quat salt of permanganate. Solutions of these salts are sometimes soluble in organic solvents:

Similarly, addition of a crown ether also gives a lipophilic salt.

===Reaction with acids and bases===
Permanganate reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid to give chlorine and manganese(II):

In neutral solution, permanganate slowly reduces to manganese dioxide (MnO2). This is the material that stains one&#x27;s skin when handling KMnO4.

KMnO4 reduces in alkaline solution to give green K2MnO4:
This reaction illustrates the relatively rare role of hydroxide as a reducing agent.

Addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to potassium permanganate gives Mn2O7. Although no reaction may be apparent, the vapor over the mixture will ignite paper impregnated with alcohol. Potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid react to produce some ozone, which has a high oxidizing power and rapidly oxidizes the alcohol, causing it to combust. As the reaction also produces explosive Mn2O7, this should only be attempted with great caution.

===Thermal decomposition===
Solid potassium permanganate decomposes when heated:
It is a redox reaction.

==Safety and handling==
Potassium permanganate poses risks as an oxidizer. Contact with skin can cause skin irritation and in some cases severe allergic reaction. It can also result in discoloration and clothing stains.

<doc id="483012" wikidata="Q7285132" url="?curid=483012" title="Raisin bran">
<text>Raisin bran (sultana bran in some countries; see sultana grape) is a breakfast cereal containing raisins and bran flakes. Raisin bran is manufactured by several companies under a variety of brand names, including the popularly known Kellogg&#x27;s Two Scoops Raisin Bran, General Mills&#x27; Total Raisin Bran, and Post Cereals&#x27; Raisin Bran. Though Raisin Bran is generally perceived as a healthier alternative to more sugary cereals, most popular brands of raisin bran contain high amounts of sugar.

==History==
Skinner&#x27;s Raisin-BRAN was the first raisin bran brand on the market, introduced in the United States in 1926 by the Skinner Manufacturing Company. For 17 years, Skinner had ownership over the product&#x27;s name, until Kellogg&#x27;s and Post began to sell their own versions of raisin bran. With concerns of losing money within grocery store sales, Skinner filed a cease-and-desist in an attempt to keep ownership over his raisin bran product.

The name &quot;Raisin-BRAN&quot; was at one time trademarked by Skinner, however in 1944 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found:

::&quot;The name &quot;Raisin-BRAN&quot; could not be appropriated as a trade-mark, because: &quot;A name which is merely descriptive of the ingredients, qualities or characteristics of an article of trade cannot be appropriated as a trademark and the exclusive use of it afforded legal protection. The use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe his own product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong, even if its effect be to cause the public to mistake the origin or ownership of the product.&quot;&quot; 

Now, any brand or manufacturer may create their own version of raisin bran and name it just that.

==Ingredients==
Ingredients vary from producer to producer, market to market and over time.

In 2020 Kellogg&#x27;s raisin bran in the United States contains the following ingredients: whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, malt flavor, salt, and assorted vitamins and minerals. The cereal&#x27;s vitamin D3 supplementation is made from lanolin, which is an animal product, rendering it as a non-vegan breakfast cereal.

==Health==
Raisin bran cereal is commonly referred to as a &quot;healthy&quot; breakfast cereal because of its high fiber content, but according to Consumer Reports, Kellogg&#x27;s Raisin Bran, for example, has a low nutrition rating.

In 1991, Kellogg&#x27;s complained that the guidelines for the USDA&#x27;s supplemental assistance WIC program did not allow for the purchase of Kellogg&#x27;s Raisin Bran for containing too much sugar. Currently, with 17 grams of sugar per cup, it has a higher content of sugar than Lucky Charms, Reese&#x27;s Puffs, and Cocoa Krispies (all known to be &quot;sugary&quot; cereals).

A serving of Kellogg&#x27;s Raisin Bran provides 80% of the Daily Value of manganese and 6% of the Daily Value of potassium, both important nutrients for the body.

Research suggests that eating commercially produced raisin bran containing sugared raisins produces acid which can lead to cavities, while home-made raisin bran, created by adding plain, unsugared raisins to bran flakes, produces less of this acid.

While Kellogg&#x27;s sultana bran received 4.5 stars out of 5 on the Australian Government&#x27;s Health Star Rating System, sugar is the fourth largest ingredient after wheat, sultanas and wheat bran.

== Manufacturers ==

Other smaller manufacturers exist worldwide.
* Kellogg&#x27;s – Split into the following two companies in 2023:
** Kellanova – While consisting mostly of the snack food business of the original Kellogg&#x27;s, it continues to manufacture and sell cereals, including raisin bran, outside North America.
** WK Kellogg Co – The North American cereal division of the original Kellogg&#x27;s, operating in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.
* Post Consumer Brands
* General Mills

<doc id="483018" wikidata="Q2982646" url="?curid=483018" title="Colin Quinn">
<text>Colin Edward Quinn (born June 6, 1959) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. He first gained widespread attention for his work as a cast member and writer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1995 to 2000, and he became known for anchoring &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, the show&#x27;s news parody segment. Prior to &quot;SNL&quot;, he was best known as the announcer/sidekick/co-host on MTV&#x27;s 1980s game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;. Following his departure from &quot;SNL&quot;, Quinn went on to host Comedy Central&#x27;s late-night panel show &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot;, where he and a panel of New York&#x27;s big names in stand-up comedy discussed and debated news stories of the day. Notable film work includes his role as Dooey in &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;, Dickey Bailey in the &quot;Grown Ups&quot; films, and playing Amy Schumer&#x27;s father in the film &quot;Trainwreck&quot;. Comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld, Tina Fey, Chris Rock, and Dave Attell have cited Quinn as the quintessential &quot;comic&#x27;s comic&quot; and New York comedian.

Quinn has also become known for his comedic one-man shows that feature his takes on history and growing up in New York City. As of 2020, he has written and starred in seven stage shows: &quot;Irish Wake&quot;, &quot;My Two Cents&quot;, &quot;Long Story Short&quot;, &quot;Unconstitutional&quot;, &quot;The New York Story&quot;, &quot;Red State Blue State&quot;, and &quot;The Wrong Side of History&quot;, two of which he collaborated on with Seinfeld as director. &quot;Long Story Short&quot; was filmed as an HBO special that aired on April 9, 2011, and &quot;Unconstitutional&quot;, &quot;The New York Story&quot;, and &quot;Red State Blue State&quot; were released as Netflix specials.

==Early life==
Quinn was born on June 6, 1959, in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, where he was raised, the son of teachers. He is of Irish descent. Quinn&#x27;s paternal grandparents arrived from Belfast around 1920. He attended Stony Brook University, in Stony Brook, Long Island, but did not graduate. He stopped drinking in the early 1980s after several bad experiences with alcohol, including blackouts and arrests.

==Career==

===Early career===
Quinn began performing stand-up comedy in 1984. He first achieved fame in 1987 as the sidekick announcer of the MTV game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;, which lasted five seasons. Quinn also hosted the final episodes of the series in 1990 due to regular host Ken Ober&#x27;s commitment to the series &quot;Parenthood&quot;. In 1989, he hosted the A&amp;E stand-up showcase &quot;Caroline&#x27;s Comedy Hour&quot;, and wrote and acted in the comedic short/music video &quot;Going Back to Brooklyn&quot; (a parody of LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;) with Ben Stiller. He wrote for &quot;In Living Color&quot;, and co-wrote and produced the movie &quot;Celtic Pride&quot;, which starred Damon Wayans and Dan Aykroyd.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Quinn was hired as a writer and featured player on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) in 1995 and became a full cast member during the 1997–1998 season. He established himself on the show with recurring characters and segments such as &quot;Lenny the Lion&quot;, &quot;Joe Blow&quot;, &quot;Colin Quinn Explains &quot;The New York Times&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Weekend Update&quot;.

Quinn began hosting &quot;Weekend Update&quot; in January 1998 after Norm Macdonald was fired, and anchored the segment until his departure from &quot;SNL&quot; in 2000. He commented on a number of highly publicized media circuses, including the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal and the Microsoft anti-trust trial.

During his tenure on &quot;SNL&quot;, Quinn turned down an offer for the role of Scott Evil in fellow cast member Mike Myers&#x27;s film &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;. Quinn has called the role, which was ultimately played by Seth Green, the only project he has regretted turning down.

===Television and film work and stand-up===
After leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Quinn hosted the short-lived &quot;The Colin Quinn Show&quot; on NBC in the spring of 2002. The show combined sketch comedy and stand-up in a live-to-tape format. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, it was cancelled after three episodes.

Quinn had greater success with his subsequent show, &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot;, which ran on weekdays on Comedy Central from 2002 to 2004. The show featured a panel of four comedians, with Quinn as host, discussing the social and political issues of the day. The show ran for over 200 episodes.

His stand-up was also used in the animated series &quot;Shorties Watchin&#x27; Shorties&quot;.
In 2005, Quinn participated in a USO tour of American military bases around the world, performing stand-up to entertain the troops.

He was the &quot;unofficial co-host&quot; on the Nick DiPaolo show on the now-defunct 92.3 Free FM in New York City, airing Monday–Friday from noon to three. Quinn and DiPaolo were originally slated to host the show together on WJFK-FM, but the station decided not to pick up the show. Quinn was also a regular guest on &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot; until its run ended in 2014.

Quinn played Dickie Bailey, the childhood rival to Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler&#x27;s character) in &quot;Grown Ups&quot; and &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Hermie on the HBO series &quot;Girls&quot;.

Quinn wrote and starred in the L/Studio web series &quot;Cop Show&quot;, which premiered in February 2015. The series stars Quinn as a satirical, pompous version of himself, starring in a New York City-based crime drama. The show&#x27;s guest stars have included Jerry Seinfeld, Dave Attell, Chris Rock, Steve Buscemi, Jim Gaffigan, Michael Che, Tom Papa, Jim Norton, Pat Cooper, Irina Shayk and Amy Schumer.

Quinn had a supporting role in Amy Schumer&#x27;s film debut, &quot;Trainwreck&quot;, as her character&#x27;s father. He was critically praised for his performance.

===One-man shows===
Quinn made his Broadway debut in 1998 in a one-man show, &quot;Colin Quinn: An Irish Wake&quot;, co-written with Lou DiMaggio. The show reflected Quinn&#x27;s upbringing within the Irish-American community of Brooklyn; it was set at a wake in 1976, with Quinn portraying family members and acquaintances who show up for the event.

In 2009, Quinn premiered his second one-man show, &quot;My Two Cents&quot;, which covers the economic crumbling of the American empire.

In 2010, Quinn premiered his third one-man show &quot;Colin Quinn Long Story Short&quot; on Broadway, directed by Jerry Seinfeld. The show covered world history from prehistoric times to the present, offering satirical takes on the rise and fall of various world empires. Quinn recorded a special performance of the show that aired on HBO on April 9, 2011. A Brazilian version of the show featuring comedian Bruno Motta has the title &quot;1 Milhao de Anos em 1 Hora&quot; (&quot;1 Million Years in 1 Hour&quot;).

In 2013, Quinn premiered another one-man show on historical themes, &quot;Unconstitutional&quot;, which covers the United States Constitution, its creation, and its impact on the American psyche.

Quinn starred in his fifth one-man show, &quot;The New York Story&quot;, in July and August 2015 at the Cherry Lane Theatre. The show was based upon the experiences chronicled in his book, &quot;The Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America&quot;. It delves into his growing up in the ethnically diverse Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and how it has changed over the years into its current state. Seinfeld, who directed &quot;Long Story Short&quot;, returned as director.

In early 2019, Quinn premiered his sixth one-man show, &quot;Red State Blue State&quot;, at the Minetta Lane Theatre. The show explored contemporary politics in the United States on both sides of the primary political spectrum.

In 2020, Quinn released his second book, &quot;Overstated: A Coast-to-Coast Roast of the 50 States&quot;, and directed the HBO Max comedy special &quot;Colin Quinn &amp; Friends: A Parking Lot Comedy Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
In conversation with Judd Apatow in 2015 for the David Lynch Foundation Trainwreck tour, Quinn said he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation for five years.

On February 14, 2018, Quinn suffered a heart attack in New York. On Twitter several days later, he said he was doing well but if he dropped dead &quot;you would see a funeral like Al Capone!&quot;

On June 8, 2019, Quinn married &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; producer Jen Sochko.

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, Quinn was named No. 56 on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.

He was named one of the Top 100 Irish Americans of the year in 2004 and 2011 by the magazine &quot;Irish America&quot;.

<doc id="483027" wikidata="Q4412467" url="?curid=483027" title="North-West Frontier Province">
<text>The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP; ) was a province of British India from 1901 to 1947, of the Dominion of Pakistan from 1947 to 1955, and of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan from 1970 to 2010. It was established on 9 November 1901 from the north-western districts of the British Punjab, during the British Raj. Following the referendum in 1947 to join either Pakistan or India, the province voted hugely in favour of joining Pakistan and it acceded accordingly on 14 August 1947. It was dissolved to form a unified province of West Pakistan in 1955 upon promulgation of One Unit Scheme and was reestablished in 1970. It was known by this name until 19 April 2010, when it was dissolved and redesignated as the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, by President Asif Ali Zardari.

The province covered an area of , including much of the current Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province but excluding the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the former princely states of Amb, Chitral, Dir, Phulra and Swat. Its capital was the city of Peshawar, and the province was composed of six divisions (Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Hazara, Kohat, Mardan, and Peshawar Division; Malakand was later added as the seventh division). Until 1947, the province was bordered by five princely states to the north, the minor states of the Gilgit Agency to the northeast, the province of Punjab to the east and the province of Balochistan to the south. The Kingdom of Afghanistan lay to the northwest, with the Federally Administered Tribal Areas forming a buffer zone between the two.

== History ==
===Formation===

The northwestern frontier areas were annexed by the East India Company after the Second Sikh War (1848–49). The territories thenceforth formed a part of Punjab until the province, then known as North West Frontier Province, was created in 1901 from the north-western districts of the Punjab Province.
This region, along with the &#x27;Frontier Tribal Areas&#x27;, acted as a buffer zone with Afghanistan.

===Inside Pakistan===
Before the Partition of India, the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum was held in July 1947 to decide the future of NWFP, in which the people of the province decided in favor of joining Pakistan. Chief Minister Dr Khan Sahib, along with his brother Bacha Khan and the Khudai Khidmatgars, boycotted the referendum, citing that it did not have the options of the NWFP becoming independent or joining Afghanistan.

As a separate province, the NWFP lasted until 1955 when it was merged into the new province of West Pakistan, under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali. It was recreated after the dissolution of the One Unit system and lasted under its old nomenclature until April 2010, when it was renamed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

== Government ==
The offices of Governor and Chief Minister of the North-West Frontier Province lasted until 14 October 1955.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
Historical population, language, and religious counts in North-West Frontier Province were enumerated in all districts (Hazara, Mardan, Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan), detailed in the population, language, and religious tables above and below. Separate population counts were taken in the Agencies and Tribal Areas, as detailed on the respective article page.

At independence, there was a clear Muslim Pashtun, Hindkowan, and Punjabi majority in the North-West Frontier Province, although there were also significant Hindu and Sikh Pashtun, Hindkowan, and Punjabi minorities scattered across the province.

=== Language ===
The languages of the North-West Frontier Province included Pashto, Hindko, Kohistani and others, although most of the population spoke either Pashto or Lahnda/Western Punjabi (primarily Hindko and Saraiki). Prior to the arrival of the British, the &quot;official language&quot;, for governmental uses and such, was Persian.
==== Districts ====

=== Religion ===

Religious counts below is for the entirety of NWFP (Hazara, Mardan, Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan). The Agencies and Tribal Areas constituted a separate administrative division where religious composition was not enumerated, except at small Trans-Frontier Posts in the region.
Adherents of Islam who were indigenous to frontier regions that continued to have relatively large Hindu populations, and who were also relatively recent converts, were influenced by some traditions of Hinduism; in contrast, Muslims in frontier regions that had been further influenced by orthodox Islam and converted at a much earlier date were noted in their relatively different cultural habits.
Similarly, adherents of Hinduism who belonged to the various castes and tribes who were indigenous to the frontier regions had considerable Islamic influence, owing to their status as a religious minority in the region for centuries, and thus formed religious syncretism that incorporated aspects from both faiths into their cultures and traditions. 
Lastly, decadal census reports throughout the colonial era frequently detailed the difficulty of differentiating adherents of Hinduism with adherents of Sikhism, owing to the traditional ability of the former in assimilating and integrating followers of varied thought into Hinduism. 
==== Districts ====

With rapid population growth occurring across all districts in the province, Mardan District was added to the North–West Frontier Province in 1941.

<doc id="483029" wikidata="Q7958624" url="?curid=483029" title="Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois">
<text>Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886), also known as the Wabash Case, was a Supreme Court decision that severely limited the rights of states to control or impede interstate commerce. It led to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

==The court==
The majority&#x27;s opinion was written by Justice Samuel Miller; joining him were associate justices Stephen Field, John Harlan, William Woods, Stanley Matthews, and Samuel Blatchford. Dissenting were Chief Justice Morrison Waite and associate justices Joseph Bradley and Horace Gray.

==The case==
The case was argued on April 14, 1886 - April 15, 1886 and was decided on October 25, 1886, by vote of 6 to 3. Associate Justice Miller wrote for the Court with Associate Justices Field, Harlan, Woods, Matthews, and Blatchford concurring; Associate Justices Bradley and Gray, along with Chief Justice Waite, dissented.

In &quot;Wabash&quot;, &quot;direct&quot; burdens on interstate commerce were not permitted by the Export Tax Clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 9); however, those &quot;indirect&quot; burdens were permitted under the Commerce Clause. This was a standard enacted in &quot;Cooley v. Board of Wardens&quot; (1852).

==Effects of decision==
*The &quot;Wabash&quot; decision led to the creation in 1887 of the first modern regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission.
*It clarified the &quot;direct&quot; v. &quot;indirect&quot; test (though this doctrine was abandoned in the 1930s).
*It was one of the first instances in government assuming responsibility for economic affairs that had previously been delegated to the states.

<text>In chess, a back-rank checkmate (also known as a corridor mate) is a checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along the opponent&#x27;s back (that is, the row closest to them) in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank.
==Introduction==
Beginners are more likely to succumb to back-rank checkmate, as they are more likely to miss threats in general. At higher levels of play, though the mate itself does not occur very often, play is often affected by the possibility of it—being forced to prevent the mate at all costs may leave a player vulnerable to other threats and tactical ideas they might be more likely to miss. 
Back-rank mates are often guarded against by a friendly rook or queen protecting the back rank. However, it may be possible for the attacking side to deflect one of these pieces away from defensive duties, sacrifice a queen for one of them, or exchange one of them, or
the pieces may simply be overworked. In the example shown to the left, White can play 1.Qxc6 and black cannot reply 1...Rxc6 because of 2.Rd8+ Rxd8 3.Rxd8# with a back-rank mate. Black therefore loses his bishop for no compensation—and Black has no good continuation because of the threat of Qxa8 or Qxc8, for example, 1...Qa6 2.Qxa8! Rxa8 3.Rd8+ Rxd8 4.Rxd8#. If Black tries to defend the back rank so that White&#x27;s queen and bishop are skewered, White can keep an extra piece, for example 1...b5 (defending d8 with the queen) 2.Qf3! keeping the rook on c8 stuck to the defense of the rook on a8, or 1...g6 (creating luft) 2.Qf6! and Black still cannot take due to the back-rank mate.

Back-rank threats can be guarded against more permanently by moving one of the pawns in front of the king to give the king a &quot;flight square&quot; (or &quot;luft&quot;). If it were Black to play in the example to the left, he could counter White&#x27;s threat with, for example, 1...g6, giving the king a square on g7 to which it can safely move. Note, however, that 1...h6 in this example would not do the job, as after the d3-rook moves, the h7-square is covered by the white bishop. Black cannot move the bishop to safety first either, due to a situational pin, e.g. 1...Bb7? 2.Qxc8+! Rxc8 3.Rd8+ Rxd8 4.Rxd8#, or 1...Bd7 2.Rxd7 when the queen once again cannot be taken due to the back rank threat.

It is often not a good idea to play such pawn moves unless there is a pressing need to do so, as they can not only represent a loss of time, but may also allow enemy penetration around the squares weakened by the pawn advance. In many chess openings, however, they are often played for some other purpose, before any back-rank threat has emerged (...h6 is often played to &quot;put the question&quot; to a white bishop on g5, for example; see also Fianchetto).

==Examples==
In high-level games, a deflection is often necessary to force a back rank mate. Below are two famous examples.

===Bernstein vs. Capablanca===

One of José Raúl Capablanca&#x27;s most famous games featured a variety of back-rank threats at the end. It was an exhibition game played in Moscow in 1914 against Ossip Bernstein (Capablanca had the black pieces). The position shown to the right was reached after White&#x27;s 29th move. Capablanca now played 29...Qb2! The simplest point is that 30.Qxb2 is not possible because of the back-rank mate 30...Rd1#, but there are several related ideas: for example, 30.Qe1, apparently defending the threatened rook, loses to 30...Qxc3 (if 31.Qxc3 then 31...Rd1+ 32.Qe1 Rxe1#); 30.Rc2 fails to 30...Qb1+ 31.Qf1 Qxc2; and 30.Qc2 loses to 30...Qa1+ 31.Qc1 Rd1+ 32.Qxd1 Qxd1#, or 30...Qxc2 31.Rxc2 Rd1#. After 30.Rc8 it looks like white may turn the tables as 30...Rxc8? allows 31.Qxb2 to win a queen for a rook, however Capablanca has 30...Qa1+ (or Qb1+) when instead White loses a rook after 31.Qf1 Qxf1+ 32.Kxf1 Rxc8. Similarly, 30.Qd3 loses to 30...Qa1+ (not 30...Rxd3?? 31.Rc8+) 31.Qf1 Qxc3. So Bernstein had to resign.

Note that had Capablanca played for the back-rank mate more directly with 29...Qb1+ 30.Qf1 Rd1?? (30...Qxa2 would be sensible), he would himself have lost to the back-rank mate 31.Rc8+ Rd8 32.Rxd8#.
===Adams vs. Torre Repetto===

This game was most likely never played, instead being composed by Carlos Torre Repetto as a tribute to his instructor Edwin Ziegler Adams. In this position, Black&#x27;s rook on c8 and queen on d7 are all what prevent White from mating with Rxe8+, so White begins deflecting the black queen or rook by force:
:18.Qg4! Qb5
If 18... Qd8, then 19.Qxc8! wins a rook, since the rook on e8 now cannot move off e8 to recapture and thus cannot add to the defense of e8. Black cannot play 18...Rxe2 because 19.Qxd7 wins the queen for a rook, as the white knight guards the other rook on e1. Neither rook can move to defend the queen, as after 18...R(either)d8, the rook is overloaded and 19.Qxd7 simply wins a queen.
:19.Qc4!!
As with the previous example, the perpetrator of the back rank mate must be careful to not themselves fall for one: 19.a4?? allows 19...Qxe2! when 20.Rxe2 allows 20...Rc1+ 21.Ne1 Rxe1+ 22.Rxe1 Rxe1#. With this and the following move, White obstructs the c-file with tempo.
:19... Qd7 20.Qc7!! Qb5
At no point can Black take the queen with either rook or queen, because of Rxe8+. If 20…Qa4, then 21. Re4!.
:21.a4!
White must once again be careful with their own back rank: the immediate 21.Qxb7?? loses to 21...Qxe2! since 22.Rxe2 allows 22...Rc1+ 23.Re1 R(either)xe1+ 24.Nxe1 Rxe1#. With this move, White prepares the following move, removing their rook from e2 with tempo.
:21... Qxa4 22.Re4!
Black&#x27;s queen has only one remaining safe square to defend e8 from.
:22... Qb5
If 22...Qxe4, then 23.Rxe4 and neither black rook can take either white major piece, as the other black rook then falls with check and subsequently back rank mate.
:23.Qxb7!! 1–0
Black&#x27;s queen has no remaining safe squares from which to defend e8 and is hanging, so Black must either lose at least a queen for a rook or be checkmated on the back rank.

<text>The International Meteorological Organization (IMO; 1873–1951) was the first organization formed with the purpose of exchanging weather information among the countries of the world. It came into existence from the realization that weather systems move across country boundaries; and that knowledge of pressure, temperature, precipitations, etc., upstream and downstream are needed for weather forecasting. It was superseded by the World Meteorological Organization.

== History ==
The Renaissance brought significant development of instruments to measure atmospheric phenomena and scales to compare them. Subsequent developments in atmospheric science in the 18th century confirmed the need for widespread measurement and uniform transnational measurement scales. In the early 19th century, countries began to share meteorological data, and on this basis a conference was held in Cambridge in 1845 with representation by the leading British and European meteorologists, including:
* Austrian Empire (Bohemia) – John Parish von Senftenberg, the founder of the Astronomical, Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory at Senftenberg (now Žamberk);
* Austrian Empire (Bohemia) – Karl Kreil, Director of the Imperial Observatory of Prague;
* Kingdom of Bavaria – Johann von Lamont, Director of the Bogenhausen Observatory in Münich;
* Prussia – Georg Adolf Erman, circumnavigator and meteorologist, professor at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (Humboldt University of Berlin);
* Prussia – Dr. Palon Heinrich Ludwig von Bogusławski, Director of the Royal Prussian Observatory in Breslau (Wrocław);
* Prussia – Heinrich Wilhelm Dove of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität;
* Russia – Adolph Theodor Kupffer, Director-General of the Russian System of Magnetic and Meteorological Observation;
* John Frederick William Herschel, committee chairman for the conference;
* Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, geologist;
* George Peacock, Dean of Ely;
* William Whewell, astronomer;
* Humphrey Lloyd, physicist;
* George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal;
* Edward Sabine, astronomer and geophysicist;
* Thomas MacDougall Brisbane, astronomer;
* John Phillips, geologist.

Matthew Fontaine Maury, of the US Navy, initiated the convening of the first true International Meteorological conference from late August through early September 1853. The conference opened its proceedings at Brussels, Belgium, on 23 August 1853, in the residence of M. Piercot, the Minister of the Interior. The governments represented at the first International Conference, and the names of the officers who attended were :
*Adolphe Quetelet, director of the Royal Observatory of Belgium and general secretary of the &quot;Academie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts&quot; with Victor Lahure, navy captain and general director of the Navy, represented Belgium.
*P. Rothe, navy captain and director of the depot of marine charts represented Denmark.
*A. De la Marche, hydrographic engineer for the imperial navy represented France.
*Frederick William Beechey, captain Royal Navy and member of the Naval Department or the Board of Trade with Henry James, captain royal engineers represented the United Kingdom.
*Marin H. Jansen, lieutenant of the Royal navy represented the Netherlands.
*Nils Ihlen, lieutenant of the royal navy represented Norway.
*J. De Mattos Corroêa, captain-lieutenant of the Royal navy represented Portugal.
*Alexis Gorkovenko, captain-lieutenant the Imperial navy represented Russia.
*Carl Anton Pettersson, first lieutenant royal navy represented Sweden.
*Matthew Fontaine Maury, lieutenant of the Navy represented the United States.

C. H. D. Buys Ballot&#x27;s 1872 paper &quot;Suggestions on a Uniform System of Meteorological Observations&quot; pushed for the creation of an international body, and a second International Meteorological Congress was held in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, in September 1873 which agreed to begin preparations for an &quot;International Meteorological Organization&quot; (&quot;IMO&quot;). There they decided that membership would be the directors of national meteorological services. A Permanent Meteorological Committee was established with Buys Ballot, director of the Dutch meteorological service, becoming the first president.

A second congress in Rome 1879 decided on the IMO establishment and elected an International Meteorological Committee to prepare for the next Conference of Directors. The director of the Central Geophysical Observatory in Saint Petersburg, Swiss born Heinrich von Wild was appointed president, and the head of British Meteorological Office, Robert Scott was appointed secretary. There was however no separate funding. Also the directors agreed on a collaborative research effort with the International Polar Year 1882–1883. The first International Meteorological Tables were published in 1889.

The 1891 Conference of Directors of Meteorological Services convened in Munich. The organization was further refined by electing an Executive Bureau and deciding upon the first permanent topic commission, the Commission for Terrestrial Magnetism.

The 1896 Conference of Directors in Paris established more commissions: the Commission for Radiation and Insolation, and the Commission for Aeronautics. At the same year IMO published the first International Cloud Atlas.

In 1905 the Conference of Directors convened in Innsbruck. Léon Teisserenc de Bort proposed a telegraph-based worldwide weather station network, the &quot; Mondial&quot;. Simplifying Teisserenc de Bort&#x27;s vision, the IMO decided that the network should collect, calculate, and distribute monthly and annual averages for pressure, temperature, and precipitation from a well-distributed sample of land based on meteorological stations, in effect a global climatological database. The distribution
standard was two stations within each ten-degree latitude/longitude quadrangle. Ultimately, the network comprises about 500 land stations between 80°N and 61°S. The first annual data set, for 1911, appeared in 1917.

Between the two world wars there were four further Conferences of Directors, 1919 in Paris, 1923 in Utrecht, 1929 in Copenhagen and 1935 in Warsaw. The IMO did not acquire a permanent secretariat until 1926, and the latter&#x27;s annual budget never exceeded US$20,000.

In September 1929 the Copenhagen Conference of Directors set up a technical Commission For Climatology, which held a meeting at Innsbruck discussing issues such as the relationship between dynamic meteorology and climatology. At its 1934 Wiesbaden meeting the Commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. the baseline for measuring climate fluctuations.

The 1946 Conference of Directors acknowledged the need for an organisation supported by governments. Preparations continued with conferences in 1947 in Washington DC and 1961 in Paris. In 1951 the World Meteorological Organization became a specialized agency of the United Nations in direct succession of the IMO. The members of the WMO are representatives of their respective countries, not their weather services.

<text>Frosted Flakes or Frosties is a breakfast cereal, produced by WK Kellogg Co for the United States, Canada, and Caribbean markets and by Kellanova for the rest of the world, and consisting of sugar-coated corn flakes. It was introduced in the United States, in 1952, as &quot;Sugar Frosted Flakes&quot;. The word &quot;sugar&quot; was dropped from the name in 1983.

Generic versions, such as store brands, are also available. Unlike many cereals, such as Cheerios, Shreddies and Rice Krispies but like Corn Flakes and Raisin Bran, the name “Frosted Flakes” is so generic that it cannot be trademarked, and thus it often shares its name with competitors.
==International names==
* Frosted Flakes (U.S. and Canada)
* Frosties (UK, Ireland, Australia, most Commonwealth nations, and European and Middle East countries; formerly Frostis in Spain)
* Zucaritas in the U.S. and Hispanic America (the word translates as &quot;little sugary things&quot;)
* Sucrilhos in Brazil (a fusion of sugar + crunch + milho (corn))
* Corn Frosty (コーンフロスティ) in Japan
* Corn Frost (콘푸로스트) in South Korea

==Popularity==
Frosted Flakes was the second-best-selling cereal in the first half of 2017 within the US in gross sales, after Honey Nut Cheerios.

==Marketing==
===Mascots===
Tony the Tiger has been the mascot of Frosted Flakes since its introduction. Tony is known for saying the cereal&#x27;s slogan: &quot;They&#x27;re Gr-r-reat!&quot; (the &quot;r&quot;s in &quot;Great&quot; being drawn-out). Tony the Tiger was originally voiced by Dallas McKennon, but Thurl Ravenscroft voiced him for more than 50 years until his death in 2005. Tony was later voiced (in Canada and the US) by former professional wrestling play-by-play announcer Lee Marshall until his death on April 27, 2014. After Marshall&#x27;s death, he was replaced with Tex Brashear. In the UK, Tom Hill voiced Tony after Ravenscroft&#x27;s death. Tony is drawn wearing a red bandana on all Frosted Flakes cereal boxes.

<text>Baron Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle in the County Palatine of Durham and of Eslington Park in the County of Northumberland, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

It was created in 1821 for Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet. The title of Baron Ravensworth had previously been created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1747 for the fourth Baronet, but this had become extinct in 1784. The second Baron of this second creation was made Earl of Ravensworth and Baron Eslington, but these titles also became extinct in 1904.

==Liddell family==
;Family history
The Liddell family descends from Thomas Liddell, a wealthy merchant of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and supporter of Charles I. In 1642 he was created a Baronet, of Ravensworth Castle, in the Baronetage of England. His grandson, the third Baronet, represented Durham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the House of Commons. In 1720 he acquired the estate of Eslington Park. His grandson, the fourth Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. In 1747 he was created Baron Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle in the County Palatine of Durham, in the Peerage of Great Britain. However, this title became extinct on his death when he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew, the fifth Baronet.

;Overview of the Barony
The latter&#x27;s son, the sixth Baronet, represented County Durham in the House of Commons. In 1821 the barony of Ravensworth was revived when he was created Baron Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle in the County Palatine of Durham and of Eslington Park in the County of Northumberland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Baron, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Northumberland, North Durham and Liverpool. In 1874 he was created Baron Eslington, of Eslington Park in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Ravensworth, of Ravensworth Castle in the County Palatine of Durham. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His eldest son, the second Earl, represented Northumberland South in Parliament as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. On his death in 1904 both the barony of Eslington and the earldom became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of Ravensworth and baronetcy by his first cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of Robert Liddell, fifth son of the first Baron. the titles are held by his great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2004.

;Other family members
Three other members of the Liddell family may also be mentioned:
* Henry Liddell, son of Henry Liddell, younger son of the fifth Baronet, was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. 
* Alice Liddell, daughter of Henry Liddell, the Vice-Chancellor, was the eponymous subject of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll. 
* Guy Liddell, grandson of George Liddell, younger son of the first Baron of the second creation, was the wartime head of counter-espionage in Britain&#x27;s MI5.

;Family seat
The main seat for the family was originally at Ravensworth Castle, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. This great stately home was almost completely demolished in the 1920s due to subsidence, ironically caused by the family&#x27;s own coal mines, the profits of which had paid for its construction. The castle&#x27;s stables, which survive in a ruinous state, were featured in the Restoration (television) programme on the BBC in 2003.

The family&#x27;s present seat is the remaining residence at Eslington Park, near Alnwick in Northumberland.

<doc id="483039" wikidata="Q3540622" url="?curid=483039" title="Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program">
<text>The Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program (TOGA) was a ten-year study (1985–1994) of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), aimed specifically at the prediction of climate phenomena on time scales of months to years.

TOGA emphasized the tropical oceans and their relationship to the global atmosphere. Underlying TOGA is the premise that the dynamic adjustment of the ocean in the tropics is far more rapid than at higher latitudes. Thus disturbances emanating from the western Pacific Ocean (such as El Niño) may propagate across the basin on time scales of weeks compared to years for corresponding basin-wide propagation at higher latitudes. 

The significance of shorter dynamic times scales near the equator is that they are similar to those of highly energetic atmospheric modes. This similarity allows the formation of coupled modes between the ocean and the atmosphere. TOGA was instrumental in developing a comprehensive observing system for the equatorial Pacific Ocean and laid important groundwork for ENSO prediction, data assimilation and understanding of air-sea interaction.

==Background and motivation==
The roots of the TOGA program can be traced back to the 1920s and the work of Sir Gilbert Walker on what became known as the Southern Oscillation, an apparent linkage between atmospheric pressure anomalies throughout the Pacific Ocean that appeared to be a major driver of weather patterns. This work was furthered by Jacob Bjerknes in the 1960s when he solidified the link between the El Nino phenomena, a winter warm anomaly in the normally cool water off the coast of Peru, with the southern oscillation. 

The combined El Nino – Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, turned out to be a major contributor to seasonal climate variability with both human and economic implications. Study of these linked phenomena continued through the 1970s and 1980s via a variety observational and modeling studies which included the discovery of equatorial kelvin waves, a potential precursor to the ENSO phenomena.

This in mind, the World Climate Research Programme began to plan a decade long research initiative intended to understand ocean-atmosphere interaction in the tropical ocean basins. The goals of this program were solidified when in 1982-1983 a major El Nino event, at the time the strongest to date, struck without prior prediction or detection. This particularly strong event was punctuated by drought, flooding, extreme heat events, and severe storms. These events clearly defined a need for better predictive mechanisms for ENSO and the need for reliable real time data to support prediction.

==Launch and scientific objectives of TOGA==
TOGA was launched in 1985 with the intent of studying ocean and atmospheric variability in all three tropical ocean basins. The focus of the United States was in the Pacific Basin with funding being provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The specific goals and scientific objectives of TOGA were:

*To gain a description of the tropical oceans and the global atmosphere as a time dependent system in order to determine the extent to which the system is predictable on time scales of months to years and to understand the mechanisms and processes underlying its predictability.
*To study the feasibility of modeling the couple ocean-atmosphere system for the purpose of predicting its variation on time scales of months to years; and
*To provide the scientific background for designing an observing and data transmission system for operational predication, if this capability is demonstrated, by coupled ocean-atmosphere models.

In order to achieve the TOGA goals, a strategy of large-scale, long-term monitoring of the upper ocean and the atmosphere, intensive and very specific process-oriented studies, and modeling were planned and enacted through a series of national, multinational and international efforts. Modeling activities were coordinated by TOGA Numerical Experimentation Group (TOGA NEG).

==Observing system==
The TOGA program established an advanced ocean observing system to support research and forecasting of ENSO warm cycles. While traditional methods such as ships of opportunity and inland tide gauges were employed, the crowning achievement was the deploying of the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project (TAO) Array.

The TAO Array was a joint NOAA and Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) venture consisting of 70 moored buoys stationed along the equatorial Pacific Ocean providing real-time wind, sea surface temperature, and deep ocean temperature data using the Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System (ATLAS).

Scientists in the program made use of a host of satellite derived products even though they were not specifically created for the program. Of most importance was the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for sea surface temperature, the Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon for sea surface height and various defense passive microwave satellites for wind speed measurements.

All together, the combination of both satellite and in situ data with real time access proved critical to the success of the program.

==TOGA COARE==
From 1992 to 1993, a special field project known as the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Research Experiment (TOGA-COARE) was conducted. The four-month effort included 1200 people, over 16,000 ship hours, 125 aircraft flights and the release of 12,000 radiosondes. Its primary mission was to examine the western pacific warming pool region specifically for:
*Ocean Atmosphere interaction methods
*Mechanisms that organize convection
*Oceanic response to combined buoyancy and wind stress forcing
*Atmospheric/oceanic interactions that impact other regions 

The TOGA-COARE experiment resulted in improved understanding of atmospheric and oceanic variability on interseasonal scales including phenomena such as the Madden–Julian oscillation and westerly wind bursts. Further, the COARE program provided improvements in model parameterization for cumulus clouds, ocean mixing, and air-sea fluxes.

==Results==
The TOGA program directly resulted in improved theoretical understanding of the ENSO cycle, including interactions between trade wind variations and sea surface temperature. Further it helped explain the evolution, development, and decay of ENSO events.

As a result of TOGA, seasonal forecasts models, both statistical and dynamical, were developed. The improvement of which resulted in the first successful ENSO prediction in 1986 and yearly forecasts being produced before the end of the program.

The impacts of TOGA extended beyond purely scientific findings but changed the way work was conducted within the oceanography and meteorology fields. The TOGA program forged new cooperation between and oceanographers and meteorologists and fostered a new culture of open data access. Rather than each research collecting and using their own data, data was now freely available to all in real time.

Perhaps the greatest success of TOGA program was the successful prediction and monitoring of the 1997-1998 El Nino, one of the largest El Nino events in history. Only with the findings and data collection methods set forth during the TOGA program would such operational success be possible.

<text>Baron Rayleigh, of Terling Place in the County of Essex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 18 July 1821 for Lady Charlotte Strutt, wife of Colonel Joseph Strutt, Member of Parliament for Maldon.

Joseph Strutt had earlier declined the offer of a peerage, &#x27;under a cloak of false humility&#x27;, and instead proposed that the honour be given to his wife. She was the daughter of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster, and his wife Lady Emily Lennox, the second of the famous Lennox sisters. Her elder brother was Charles FitzGerald, 1st Baron Lecale, and her younger brother was Lord Edward FitzGerald.

The title is currently held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his uncle in 1988. The family seat is Terling Place in Essex.

<text>Philipp [[Freiherr]] von Boeselager (6 September 1917 – 1 May 2008) was the second-last surviving member of the 20 July Plot, a conspiracy of Wehrmacht officers to assassinate the German dictator Adolf Hitler in 1944.

==Early life==

Born at Burg Heimerzheim, near Bonn, he was the fifth and the second surviving son of the nine children of Albert Dominikus Hyacinthus Antonius Johannes Hubertus Vitus Joseph Maria &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Boeselager (Bonn 15 June 1883-Heimerzheim, Kr. Euskirchen 20 May 1956), by his wife (they married in Kassel on 22 September 1910), Maria-Theresia Ferdinandine Antonie Alonsia &quot;Freiin&quot; von Salis-Soglio (1890–1968), daughter of Anton Joseph Alonsius Nepomuk Stanislaus Maria &quot;Freiherr&quot; v. Salis-Soglio (1860–1939), of Gemünden and Mandel, Kreuznach, by Maria Adelheid Theresia &quot;Gräfin&quot; von Bissingen und Nippenburg (daughter of Ernst Maria Ferdinand Adam Johann Nepomuk Joseph &quot;Graf&quot; von Bissingen-Nippenburg). He attended Aloisius Jesuit secondary school Aloisiuskolleg in Godesberg.

==Role in conspiracy against Hitler==
When Boeselager was a 25-year-old field lieutenant, he was part of Operation Walküre, a plan developed to take control of Germany once Hitler had been assassinated. Boeselager&#x27;s role in the plan was to order his troops, who were unaware of the plot, to leave the front lines in Eastern Europe and to head west, where they would be airlifted to Berlin to seize crucial parts of the city in a full-scale coup d&#x27;état after Hitler had been killed.

Boeselager&#x27;s opinion turned against the Nazi government in June 1942, after he received news that five Roma people had been shot in cold blood solely because of their ethnicity. Together with his commanding officer, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, he joined a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. The first attempt was in March 1943, when both Hitler and Heinrich Himmler were coming to the front to participate in a strategy meeting with Kluge&#x27;s troops.

Boeselager was given a Walther PP with which he was to shoot both Hitler and Himmler at a dinner table in the officers&#x27; mess. However, nothing ever came of this plan because at the last minute, Himmler left Hitler&#x27;s company, and the risk of leaving him alive to succeed Hitler was too great.

The second assassination attempt was in summer 1944. No longer caring about Himmler, the conspiracy planned to kill Hitler with a bomb when he was attending another strategy meeting in a wooden barracks. When the assassin&#x27;s bomb failed to kill the &quot;Führer&quot;, Boeselager was informed in time to turn his unexplained cavalry retreat around and return to the front before suspicions could be aroused. Because of Boeselager&#x27;s fortunate timing, his involvement in the operation went undetected, and he was not executed, unlike the majority of the conspirators. Philipp&#x27;s brother Georg was also a participant in the plot, and likewise remained undetected, but was later killed in action on the Eastern Front.

Shortly before the end of the war, Boeselager overheard General Wilhelm Burgdorf saying, &quot;When the war is over, we will have to purge, after the Jews, the Catholic officers in the army&quot;. The devoutly-Catholic Boeselager noisily objected, citing his own decorations for heroism in combat. Boeselager then left before Burgdorf could respond.

==Postwar life==
After the war, Boeselager&#x27;s part in the failed attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life became known. He was regarded as a hero by many in Germany and France; in 1989 and 2004 respectively, he received the highest military medals that both countries could provide. He studied economics and became a forestry expert. Even in his old age, Boeselager still had nightmares about the conspiracy and the friends whom he lost during the war. He urged young people to become more involved in politics, as he felt apathy and the political inexperience of the German masses had been two of the key reasons why Hitler was able to come to power. The entrance to his residence in Kreuzberg bears the Latin motto &quot;Et si omnes ego non&quot; (&quot;even if all, not I&quot;).

Boeselager was a member of K.D.St.V. Ripuaria Bonn, a Roman Catholic student fraternity at the University of Bonn that now belongs to the &quot;Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen&quot;. Until his death on 1 May 2008, he still had the Walther PP pistol he was given to use to shoot Hitler.

In 2003 and 2007, Boeselager gave two interviews to the influential neo-fascist weekly &quot;Junge Freiheit&quot;. In the 2003 interview, he criticised re-united Germany&#x27;s failure to restore property collectivised in East Germany after World War II (and privatised 1990–1994) to former owners and the widespread corruption of contemporary politicians on behalf of the 20 July plotters, whom he presented as selfless idealists fighting to restore the rule of law. He defined the political aim of the 1944 plotters as &quot;saving the Reich&quot; and denied that they would have sought peace with the Western Allies. Boeselager echoed Nazi war propaganda in claiming that Germany invaded Poland in self-defence and that Soviet citizens and soldiers overwhelmingly welcomed the alleged Nazi liberation from Communist rule during the initial stage of Operation Barbarossa. In accordance with the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, he drew a firm line between the Wehrmacht and the SS with regard to supporting Hitler&#x27;s policies, which he denounced as &quot;criminal&quot;.

On 18 April 2008, just two weeks before his death, Philipp von Boeselager gave his last videotaped interview, which was conducted by Zora Wolter for the feature documentary &quot;The Valkyrie Legacy&quot;. It was televised on The History Channel in spring 2009 to coincide with the release of the film &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, starring Tom Cruise and directed by Bryan Singer. The documentary was produced by Singer and directed by Kevin Burns.

Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin was the last survivor of the 20 July plot until his death on 8 March 2013.

==Marriage==
Boeselager married Rosa Maria, born Gräfin von Westphalen zu Fürstenberg (1924 - 2014). Albrecht von Boeselager (born 4 October 1949, Altenahr), former Grand Chancellor of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, is their child.

<text>Damian Watcyn Lewis (born 11 February 1971) is a British actor, musician and producer. He rose to prominence portraying U.S. Army Major Richard Winters in the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. Lewis won a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of U.S. Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody in the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot;, and received nominations for his performance as Henry VIII of England in &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;. He portrayed Bobby Axelrod in the Showtime series &quot;Billions&quot; in six out of seven seasons, and appeared in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019) as actor Steve McQueen.

==Early life and education==
Lewis was born on 11 February 1971 in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, the eldest son of Charlotte Mary (&quot;née&quot; Bowater) and John Watcyn Lewis, a City insurance broker with Lloyd&#x27;s. His paternal grandparents were Welsh, and he says he considers himself &quot;London Welsh&quot;. His maternal grandfather was Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Ian Bowater, Lord Mayor of London and the eminent naval shipbuilder and philanthropist Sir Alfred Yarrow, 1st Baronet (see Yarrow Shipbuilders), who was of partial 
Sephardic Jewish descent. Lewis has said that he &quot;went to English boarding schools and grew up around people very much like [his character] Soames and in a &quot;milieu&quot; very much like the Forsytes.

As a child, Lewis made several visits to the US to visit relatives during summer breaks. He decided to become an actor at the age of 16.

He was educated at the independent Ashdown House School in Forest Row, East Sussex, and at Eton College, and graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1993.

==Career==
Lewis once worked as a telemarketer selling car alarms. His first television appearance was as a medical student in &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;, a feature-length episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, an ITV Studios TV production, broadcast in 1995. He also appeared as a rakish student in an early episode of the drama series &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; (1996). He appeared in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1997) as Patrick Conner.

At this time he was also working as an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing among other roles Borgheim in Adrian Noble&#x27;s production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Little Eyolf&quot; and Posthumus Leonatus in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. He would later go on to star in another of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, as Karsten Bernick in &quot;Pillars of the Community&quot; at the National Theatre in November 2005.

He also appeared in Jonathan Kent&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, playing Laertes. This production was seen by Steven Spielberg, who later cast Lewis as Richard Winters in &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001), the first role of several that required him to have a credible American accent.

He was in the 2000 series called &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; as the love interest of Dervla Kirwan. Subsequently, Lewis portrayed Soames Forsyte in the ITV series &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, which earned him positive reviews. He returned to the US to star in &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, a Lawrence Kasdan film about a man who becomes possessed by an evil alien. The character is American but when possessed he takes on a British accent. On the heels of this role, he starred in &quot;Keane&quot; as a Manhattanite with a fragile mental state who is searching for his missing daughter. Despite the film&#x27;s poor box-office, Lewis&#x27;s performance in the role was very well reviewed.

He played Jeffrey Archer in the TV special Jeffrey Archer: The Truth. Since 2004, he has appeared in a number of films, as well as the 2005 BBC TV adaptation of the Shakespeare comedy &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, as part of the &quot;ShakespeaRe-Told&quot; season. Lewis played the role of Yassen Gregorovich in the film &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;. In 2006, he appeared in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s BBC drama &quot;Friends and Crocodiles&quot;. He has appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; as guest host several times; on 10 November 2006, 1 May 2009, 18 November 2010, 27 April 9 November 2012 and 31 October 2014.

In 2008, Lewis starred as the main character Charlie Crews in the American television series &quot;Life&quot; on NBC. The show premiered in the US on 26 September 2007 and was affected by the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. Only half of the first season&#x27;s shows were produced. Regardless, the show won a 2008 AFI Award for best television series. Although the show received critical acclaim, when it returned the following television season, it was shuffled from night to night, and eventually cancelled by NBC to clear its time slot for &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

Lewis appeared the following year in the lead role in &quot;The Baker&quot;, a film directed by his brother, Gareth. Damian took a supporting role of Rizza in &quot;The Escapist&quot;, which he also helped produce. He led the cast in Martin Crimp&#x27;s version of Molière&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;, which opened in December 2009 at the Comedy Theatre, London. Other cast members included Tara Fitzgerald, Keira Knightley and Dominic Rowan.

Lewis played Tory Prime Minister Simon Laity in two seasons of &quot;Number 10&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

He played Gareth, the father of an 11-year-old Liverpool F.C. fan, in the 2011 film &quot;Will&quot;.

From 2011 to 2013, Lewis had a starring role as Gunnery Sergeant Nicholas Brody in the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot;, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award. In 2013, he narrated poetry for &quot;The Love Book App&quot;, an &quot;interactive anthology of love literature developed by Allie Byrne Esiri&quot;.

In 2016 he began starring as billionaire hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod in the Showtime series &quot;Billions&quot;. He left the show in 2021 after five seasons, but returned for half of season 7. In 2016 he appeared in the British spy film &quot;Our Kind of Traitor&quot;.

In 2024, he played a dual role as Peter Radley and his brother Will Radley, alongside Kelly Macdonald in the vampire comedy film &quot;The Radleys&quot;.

===Music===
In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2022, Lewis said that he had long-standing ambitions to be a musician, and had been collaborating with jazz artist Giacomo Smith, firstly on cover songs and then writing new material for an album that would be released in 2023: &quot;I started writing and found out there was lots that I actually did want to write, and before we knew it we had a record’s worth of songs. We’ve ended up with a rootsy, jazzy, rock’n’rolly, singer-songwritery-type album.&quot; 

Lewis released his debut single, &quot;Down On the Bowery&quot;, on 13 April 2023. His debut album, &quot;Mission Creep&quot;, was released in June that year on Decca Records.

On 9 July 2023, he sang the national anthem at the British Grand Prix, accompanied by a saxophonist.
==Other activities==
In 2009 Lewis featured in &quot;Inspired By Music&quot;, a book commissioned by The Prince&#x27;s Trust, written and photographed by celebrity photographer Cambridge Jones, and sponsored by Starbucks. It features personal reflections by 36 celebrities as well as four ordinary people helped by The Prince&#x27;s Trust, about musical lyrics that inspired them. Lewis&#x27;s photo portrait also featured in Jones&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Talking Pictures&quot;, featuring famous people of Welsh descent, that toured the world from 2010.

In 2010, Lewis became a trade justice ambassador for the charity Christian Aid. In May 2006, June 2016, June 2018, and June 2022, he played for England in Soccer Aid, and played golf for Europe in the &quot;All*Star Cup&quot; in August 2006, both shown on ITV.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lewis and his wife Helen McCrory supported Feed NHS, a fundraiser to give food from high street restaurants to NHS staff. By April 2020, they had raised £1 million for the charity. The initiative started in London, but following its success, plans were announced to roll it out to other cities in the UK.

==Recognition==
===Honours===
Lewis was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to drama and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

===Awards and nominations===

Lewis&#x27; portrayal of U.S. Army Major Richard Winters in the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; earned him a Golden Globe nomination.

Lewis&#x27; performance as U.S. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Nicholas Brody in the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot; earned him a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award in 2012.

His performance as Henry VIII of England in &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; earned him his third Primetime Emmy nomination and fourth Golden Globe nomination.

<text>The bypass ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core. A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10 kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1 kg of air passing through the core.

Turbofan engines are usually described in terms of BPR, which together with engine pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature and fan pressure ratio are important design parameters. In addition, BPR is quoted for turboprop and unducted fan installations because their high propulsive efficiency gives them the overall efficiency characteristics of very high bypass turbofans. This allows them to be shown together with turbofans on plots which show trends of reducing specific fuel consumption (SFC) with increasing BPR. BPR is also quoted for lift fan installations where the fan airflow is remote from the engine and doesn&#x27;t physically touch the engine core.

Bypass provides a lower fuel consumption for the same thrust, measured as thrust specific fuel consumption (grams/second fuel per unit of thrust in kN using SI units). Lower fuel consumption that comes with high bypass ratios applies to turboprops, using a propeller rather than a ducted fan. High bypass designs are the dominant type for commercial passenger aircraft and both civilian and military jet transports.

Business jets use medium BPR engines.

Combat aircraft use engines with low bypass ratios to compromise between fuel economy and the requirements of combat: high power-to-weight ratios, supersonic performance, and the ability to use afterburners.

==Principles==
If all the gas power from a gas turbine is converted to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate large mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine&#x27;s own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The first jet aircraft were subsonic and the poor suitability of the propelling nozzle for these speeds due to high fuel consumption was understood, and bypass proposed, as early as 1936 (U.K. Patent 471,368).
The underlying principle behind bypass is trading exhaust velocity for extra mass flow which still gives the required thrust but uses less fuel. Turbojet inventor Frank Whittle called it &quot;gearing down the flow&quot;. Power is transferred from the gas generator to an extra mass of air, i.e. a larger diameter propelling jet, moving more slowly. The bypass spreads the available mechanical power across more air to reduce the velocity of the jet. The trade-off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing disc loading and power loading. For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor.

Bypass usually refers to transferring gas power from a gas turbine to a bypass stream of air to reduce fuel consumption and jet noise. Alternatively, there may be a requirement for an afterburning engine where the sole requirement for bypass is to provide cooling air. This sets the lower limit for BPR and these engines have been called &quot;leaky&quot; or continuous bleed turbojets (General Electric YJ-101 BPR 0.25) and low BPR turbojets (Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120). Low BPR (0.2) has also been used to provide surge margin as well as afterburner cooling for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58.

==Description==
In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine the high temperature and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a propelling nozzle and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power produced by the turbine. In a bypass design, extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward from the front of the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine&#x27;s gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less). Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gives significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet&#x27;s low-loss propelling nozzle. The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet&#x27;s single nozzle.

To see the influence of increasing BPR alone on overall efficiency in the aircraft, i.e. SFC, a common gas generator has to be used, i.e. no change in Brayton cycle parameters or component efficiencies. Bennett shows in this case a relatively slow rise in losses transferring power to the bypass at the same time as a fast drop in exhaust losses with a significant improvement in SFC. In reality increases in BPR over time come along with rises in gas generator efficiency masking, to some extent, the influence of BPR.

Only the limitations of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the compression ratio of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high propulsive efficiency because even slightly increasing the velocity of a very large volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine&#x27;s mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities. A low disc loading (thrust per disc area) increases the aircraft&#x27;s energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.

The Rolls–Royce Conway turbofan engine, developed in the early 1950s, was an early example of a bypass engine. The configuration was similar to a 2-spool turbojet but to make it into a bypass engine it was equipped with an oversized low pressure compressor: the flow through the inner portion of the compressor blades went into the core while the outer portion of the blades blew air around the core to provide the rest of the thrust. The bypass ratio for the Conway varied between 0.3 and 0.6 depending on the variant

The growth of bypass ratios during the 1960s gave jetliners fuel efficiency that could compete with that of piston-powered planes.
Today (2015), most jet engines have some bypass. Modern engines in slower aircraft, such as airliners, have bypass ratios up to 12:1; in higher-speed aircraft, such as fighters, bypass ratios are much lower, around 1.5; and craft designed for speeds up to Mach 2 and somewhat above have bypass ratios below 0.5.

Turboprops have bypass ratios of 50-100, although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans and propeller airflow is slower than the airflow from turbofan nozzles.

<text>Pistolet-pulemet (Пистоле́т-пулемёт) means submachine gun in Russian. The name is most often used in relation to a series of weapons made by the Soviet Union which includes PPD-40, PPSh-41 and PPS-43. The letter after the PP (ПП) in the gun&#x27;s designation is from the designer&#x27;s name. For example, the &quot;Sh&quot; in PPSh stands for &quot;Shpagin&quot; (Russian: &quot;Шпагин&quot;).

This name is also used in submachine guns manufactured in Russian Federation. For example, PP-19 Bizon, PP-93 and PP-2000.

<text>Baron Delamere, of Vale Royal in the County Palatine of Chester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 17 July 1821 for Thomas Cholmondeley, a former Member of Parliament for Cheshire. This Vale Royal branch of the Cholmondeley family descends from Thomas Cholmondeley (died 1653), younger brother of Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster, and Hugh Cholmondeley (1591–1665), ancestor of the Marquesses of Cholmondeley. The first Baron was succeeded by his son. Before acceding to the title in 1855, the second Baron represented Denbighshire and Montgomery in the House of Commons as a Tory.

His eldest son, also named Hugh, acceded to the title in 1887, and in the same year, he immigrated to Kenya, where he acquired a major estate. The third Baron&#x27;s eldest son inherited his father&#x27;s title in 1931. In 1934, he attempted to re-establish his family at Vale Royal, the family&#x27;s country home and baronial seat from the 17th century; however, the great house was requisitioned as a sanatorium during the war years. When it was sold in 1947, the fourth Baron returned to Kenya. the title was held by the sixth Baron, who succeeded his grandfather in 2024. 

The family surname is pronounced .

<doc id="483055" wikidata="Q1385463" url="?curid=483055" title="Acequia">
<text>An acequia () or  (, also known as síquia ) is a community-operated watercourse used in Spain and former Spanish colonies in the Americas for irrigation. Acequias are found in parts of Spain, the Andes, northern Mexico, and the modern-day American Southwest (northern New Mexico and southern Colorado).

Scholars describe acequias as &quot;technological systems that are designed, maintained, and operated to meet a variety of productive goals, social services, and health needs, with the practice of irrigated agriculture being of paramount importance.&quot; In the United States, the oldest acequias were established more than 400 years ago by Spanish colonizers. The traditional form of governance over acequias is the oldest form of European resource management still alive in the United States today.

Acequias are filled by snow melt and rain to water orchards, gardens, and other agricultural fields. Other than watering crops, acequias have deep cultural significance for many Indigenous and Native communities in New Mexico and Colorado.

==Etymology==

The Spanish word (and the Catalan word ) originate from Arabic word al-sāqiyah () which has more than one meaning: &quot;the water conduit&quot; or &quot;one that bears water&quot; as well as &#x27;bartender&#x27; (from , &quot;to give water, drink&quot;), and also refers to a type of water wheel.

== History ==
Traditionally, the Spanish acequias have been associated with the Muslim colonization of the Iberian Peninsula; however the most likely hypothesis is that they improved on irrigation systems that already existed since Roman times, or even before. These ways of agricultural planning and colonization strategies come from the vast amount of cultural influences contributing to Spanish technology and governance. Likely the most meaningful stemmed from the Muslims that ruled parts of Spain for as long as eight centuries. Their ways of life influenced the Spanish and changed the way agriculture was done in Spain.

Acequias were later adopted by the Spanish and Portuguese (levadas on Madeira Island) and were utilized throughout their own colonies. Similar structures already existed in places such as Mendoza and San Juan, Argentina where acequias today run along both sides of the city streets. However, these acequias were originally dug by the Indigenous Huarpes long before the arrival of the Spanish. The introduction of acequias by the Muslims allowed for more agricultural diversity, with crops such as sugar cane and citrus fruits introduced. The system of the acequia has changed over time to avoid incidents of the resource from being overused or under-maintained.

== Usage in the American Southwest ==
In the United States, the oldest acequias were established more than 400 years ago by Spanish colonizers. Many acequias continue to provide a primary source of water for farming and ranching in the region of south central Colorado known as the Upper Rio Grande watershed or Rio Arriba and some 700 in northern New Mexico continue to function. This type of governance over acequias is to date the oldest depiction of European resource management still active in the United States today.

== Design ==
Acequias are gravity chutes, similar in concept to flumes. Some acequias are conveyed through pipes or aqueducts, of modern fabrication or decades or centuries old (see transvasement). For the system to function properly the channel must have a good gradient to maintain the flow of water.

When rainfall and snowmelt start to flow it is carried into the Acequia Madre and through the connecting channels throughout parts of New Mexico. Acequias have several components that control the transport of water:

# &quot;compuertas&quot; (headgates)- these gates open and close to allow water to flow through the channel
# &quot;canoas&quot; (canoes)- log flumes that transport water across intersecting creeks and streams
# &quot;sangrías&quot; (vessels)- lateral ditches cut perpendicular from the main canal to irrigate individual parcels of land
# &quot;desagüe&quot; (draining channel)- carries surplus water back to the stream source

Researchers affiliated with the Rio Grande Bioregions Project at Colorado College initiated a pioneering collaborative, farmer-led, and interdisciplinary study of Colorado and New Mexico acequias in 1995–99. Among the most significant findings of this study was that the acequia farms provide vital ecosystem and economic base services to the regions in which they are located. One study, as reported in , found that acequia agroecosystems promote soil conservation and soil formation, provide terrestrial wildlife habitat and movement corridors. They also protect water quality and fish habitat, promote the conservation of domesticated biodiversity of land race heirloom crops, and encourage the maintenance of a strong land and water ethic and sense of place, among other ecological and economic base values. This pioneering research on acequia ecosystem services, led by environmental anthropologist Devon G. Peña, has more recently been confirmed in other studies, e.g. , , , .

== Governance in New Mexico ==

Known among water users simply as &quot;the Acequia&quot;, various legal entities embody the community associations, or acequia associations, that govern members&#x27; water usage, depending on local precedents and traditions. An acequia organization often must include commissioners and a majordomo who administers usage of water from a ditch, regulating which holders of water rights can release water to their fields on which days. In New Mexico, by state statute, acequias as registered bodies must have three commissioners and a mayordomo. Irrigation and conservation districts typically have their own version of mayordomos, usually referred to as &quot;ditch riders&quot; by members of the districts.

Acequias in New Mexico and Colorado have successfully developed and implemented changes in state water laws to accommodate the unique norms, customs, and practices of the acequia systems. But the communal owners of the acequias in New Mexico are receiving hard economic pushes from land developers and current inflation that are pushing them to consider selling the valued acequia. The customary law of the acequia is older than and at variance with the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation, and the statutes promulgating acequia water law represent a rare instance of water pluralism in the context of Western water law in the United States (see ). For example, the Doctrine of Prior Appropriation is based on the principle of &quot;first in use, first in right&quot;, while acequia norms incorporate not just priority but principles of equity and fairness. This is evident in the fact that Prior Appropriation considers water to be a commodity owned by private individuals while acequia systems treat water as a community resource that irrigators have a shared right to use, manage, and protect. The concept of a shared responsibility natural resources reflects the beliefs stemming from the Spanish and Indigenous people who brought the acequia to the U.S. The plethora of cultural behaviors and values that created acequia communities still exist in the United States.

While prior doctrines allow for water to be sold away from the basin of origin, the acequia system prohibits the transference of water from the watershed in which it is situated and thus considers water as an &quot;asset-in-place&quot;. The Prior regime is based on a governance regime in which the members of a mutual ditch company will vote based on their proportional ownership of shares so that larger farmers have more votes. In contrast, the acequia system follows a &quot;one farmer, one vote&quot; system that has led researchers to consider this a form of &quot;water democracy&quot;.

Acequia law also requires that all persons with irrigation rights participate in the annual maintenance of the community ditch including the annual spring time ditch cleanup known as the &quot;limpieza y saca de acequia&quot;.

==Water disputes and acequias==

An example of the disputes over allocation of scarce water is the continuing controversy over acequias diverting water from Embudo Creek to the Mora River in New Mexico. Settlers along the Mora River on the eastern side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains constructed gravity-fed irrigation ditches (acequias) to divert water from three headwaters sources of the Rio Pueblo to the Mora River. (The Rio Pueblo is an upstream tributary of Embudo Creek and not the same as the Rio Pueblo de Taos) The first diversion of water from Alamitos Creek was built about 1820; the second diversion from the Rito de la Presa was built in 1864; and the third and largest diversion was from the Rito Angostura. This diversion via acequias took 20 families three years to construct from 1879 to 1882. The acequia was long and &quot;constructed without the benefit of sophisticated tools and engineering know-how, accomplishing the seemingly impossible task&quot; of bringing water from one side of the mountains to the other. In drought years as much as one-half of the water of the Rio Pueblo is diverted to the Mora River. In 2021, that water irrigated about of agricultural land owned by 143 users. 

The transfer of water was controversial. The Picuris Pueblo contested the diversion of water from their territory to the Mora River as early as the 1860s and pursued a lawsuit against the diversions of water in the 1880s. The suit was dismissed as no attorney would take the case. Disputes about water continued into the 21st century. In 2021, unidentified persons blocked the acequia directing water from Alamitos Creek with a mound of rocks and interrupted the flow of water to Mora Country. The blockage was quickly removed, but the dispute over water rights continued.

<text>An icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters, and provide safe waterways for other boats and ships. Although the term usually refers to ice-breaking ships, it may also refer to smaller vessels, such as the icebreaking boats that were once used on the canals of the United Kingdom.

For a ship to be considered an icebreaker, it requires three traits most normal ships lack: a strengthened hull, an ice-clearing shape, and the power to push through sea ice.

Icebreakers clear paths by pushing straight into frozen-over water or pack ice. The bending strength of sea ice is low enough that the ice breaks usually without noticeable change in the vessel&#x27;s . In cases of very thick ice, an icebreaker can drive its bow onto the ice to break it under the weight of the ship. A buildup of broken ice in front of a ship can slow it down much more than the breaking of the ice itself, so icebreakers have a specially designed hull to direct the broken ice around or under the vessel. The external components of the ship&#x27;s propulsion system (propellers, propeller shafts, etc.) are at greater risk of damage than the vessel&#x27;s hull, so the ability of an icebreaker to propel itself onto the ice, break it, and clear the debris from its path successfully is essential for its safety.

== History ==

=== Earliest icebreakers ===
Prior to ocean-going ships, ice breaking technology was developed on inland canals and rivers using laborers with axes and hooks. The first recorded primitive icebreaker ship was a barge used by the Belgian town of Bruges in 1383 to help clear the town moat. The efforts of the ice-breaking barge were successful enough to warrant the town purchasing four such ships. 

Ice breaking barges continued to see use during the colder winters of the Little Ice Age with growing use in the Low Country where significant amounts of trade and transport of people and goods took place. In the 15th century the use of ice breakers in Flanders (Oudenaarde, Kortrijk, Ieper, Veurne, Diksmuide and Hulst) was already well established. The use of the ice breaking barges expanded in the 17th century where every town of some importance in the Low Country used some form of icebreaker to keep their waterways clear. 

Before the 17th century the specifications of icebreakers are unknown. The specifications for ice breaking vessels show that they were dragged by teams of horses and the heavy weight of the ship pushed down on the ice breaking it. They were used in conjunction with teams of men with axes and saws and the technology behind them didn&#x27;t change much until the industrial revolution.
=== Sailing ships in the polar waters ===
Ice-strengthened ships were used in the earliest days of polar exploration. These were originally wooden and based on existing designs, but reinforced, particularly around the waterline with double planking to the hull and strengthening cross members inside the ship. Bands of iron were wrapped around the outside. Sometimes metal sheeting was placed at the bows, at the stern, and along the keel. Such strengthening was designed to help the ship push through ice and also to protect the ship in case it was &quot;nipped&quot; by the ice. Nipping occurs when ice floes around a ship are pushed against the ship, trapping it as if in a vise and causing damage. This vise-like action is caused by the force of winds and tides on ice formations.

The first boats to be used in the polar waters were those of the Eskimos. Their kayaks are small human-powered boats with a covered deck, and one or more cockpits, each seating one paddler who strokes a single or double-bladed paddle. Such boats have no icebreaking capabilities, but they are light and well fit to carry over the ice.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Viking expansion reached the North Atlantic, and eventually Greenland and Svalbard in the Arctic. Vikings, however, operated their ships in the waters that were ice-free for most of the year, in the conditions of the Medieval Warm Period.

In the 11th century, in North Russia the coasts of the White Sea, named so for being ice-covered for over half of a year, started being settled. The mixed ethnic group of the Karelians and the Russians in the North-Russia that lived on the shores of the Arctic Ocean became known as Pomors (&quot;seaside settlers&quot;). Gradually they developed a special type of small one- or two-mast wooden sailing ships, used for voyages in the ice conditions of the Arctic seas and later on Siberian rivers. These earliest icebreakers were called kochi. The koch&#x27;s hull was protected by a belt of ice-floe resistant flush skin-planking along the variable water-line, and had a false keel for on-ice portage. If a koch became squeezed by the ice-fields, its rounded bodylines below the water-line would allow for the ship to be pushed up out of the water and onto the ice with no damage.

In the 19th century, similar protective measures were adopted to modern steam-powered icebreakers. Some notable sailing ships in the end of the Age of Sail also featured the egg-shaped form like that of Pomor boats, for example the &quot;Fram&quot;, used by Fridtjof Nansen and other great Norwegian Polar explorers. &quot;Fram&quot; was the wooden ship to have sailed farthest north (85°57&#x27;N) and farthest south (78°41&#x27;S), and one of the strongest wooden ships ever built.

=== Steam-powered icebreakers ===

An early ship designed to operate in icy conditions was a wooden paddle steamer, &quot;City Ice Boat No. 1&quot;, that was built for the city of Philadelphia by Vandusen &amp; Birelyn in 1837. The ship was powered by two steam engines and her wooden paddles were reinforced with iron coverings.

With a rounded shape and strong metal hull, the Russian of 1864 was an important predecessor of modern icebreakers with propellers. The ship was built on the orders of merchant and shipbuilder Mikhail Britnev. She had the bow altered to achieve an ice-clearing capability (20° raise from keel line). This allowed &quot;Pilot&quot; to push herself on the top of the ice and consequently break it. Britnev fashioned the bow of his ship after the shape of old Pomor boats, which had been navigating icy waters of the White Sea and Barents Sea for centuries. &quot;Pilot&quot; was used between 1864 and 1890 for navigation in the Gulf of Finland between Kronstadt and Oranienbaum thus extending the summer navigation season by several weeks. Inspired by the success of &quot;Pilot&quot;, Mikhail Britnev built a second similar vessel &quot;Boy&quot; (&quot;Breakage&quot; in Russian) in 1875 and a third &quot;Booy&quot; (&quot;Buoy&quot; in Russian) in 1889.

The cold winter of 1870–1871 caused the Elbe River and the port of Hamburg to freeze over, causing a prolonged halt to navigation and huge commercial losses. Carl Ferdinand Steinhaus reused the altered bow &quot;Pilot&quot;″s design from Britnev to make his own icebreaker, &quot;Eisbrecher I&quot;.

The first true modern sea-going icebreaker was built at the turn of the 20th century. Icebreaker , was built in 1899 at the Armstrong Whitworth naval yard in England under contract from the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship borrowed the main principles from &quot;Pilot&quot; and applied them to the creation of the first polar icebreaker, which was able to run over and crush pack ice. The ship displaced 5,000 tons, and her steam-reciprocating engines delivered . The ship was decommissioned in 1963 and scrapped in 1964, making her one of the longest serving icebreakers in the world.

In Canada, the government needed to provide a way to prevent flooding due to ice jam on the St. Lawrence River. Icebreakers were built in order to maintain the river free of ice jam, east of Montréal. In about the same time, Canada had to fill its obligations in the Canadian Arctic. Large steam icebreakers, like the (1930) and (1952), were built for this dual use (St. Lawrence flood prevention and Arctic replenishment).

At the beginning of the 20th century, several other countries began to operate purpose-built icebreakers. Most were coastal icebreakers, but Canada, Russia, and later, the Soviet Union, also built several oceangoing icebreakers up to 11,000 tons in displacement.

=== Diesel-powered icebreakers ===
Before the first diesel-electric icebreakers were built in the 1930s, icebreakers were either coal- or oil-fired steam ships. Reciprocating steam engines were preferred in icebreakers due to their reliability, robustness, good torque characteristics, and ability to reverse the direction of rotation quickly. During the steam era, the most powerful pre-war steam-powered icebreakers had a propulsion power of about .

The world&#x27;s first diesel-electric icebreaker was the 4,330-ton Swedish icebreaker in 1933. At divided between two propellers in the stern and one propeller in the bow, she remained the most powerful Swedish icebreaker until the commissioning of in 1957. &quot;Ymer&quot; was followed by the Finnish , the first diesel-electric icebreaker in Finland, in 1939. Both vessels were decommissioned in the 1970s and replaced by much larger icebreakers in both countries, the 1976-built in Finland and the 1977-built in Sweden.

In 1941, the United States started building the . Research in Scandinavia and the Soviet Union led to a design that had a very strongly built short and wide hull, with a cut away forefoot and a rounded bottom. Powerful diesel-electric machinery drove two stern and one auxiliary bow propeller. These features would become the standard for postwar icebreakers until the 1980s.

Since the mid-1970s, the most powerful diesel-electric icebreakers have been the formerly Soviet and later Russian icebreakers &quot;Ermak&quot;, &quot;Admiral Makarov&quot; and &quot;Krasin&quot; which have nine twelve-cylinder diesel generators producing electricity for three propulsion motors with a combined output of . In the late 2020s, they will be surpassed by the new Canadian polar icebreakers and , which will have a combined propulsion power of .

====Canada====

In Canada, diesel-electric icebreakers started to be built in 1952, first with HMCS &quot;Labrador&quot; (was transferred later to the Canadian Coast Guard), using the USCG Wind-class design but without the bow propeller. Then in 1960, the next step in the Canadian development of large icebreakers came when was completed at Lauzon, Quebec. A considerably bigger and more powerful ship than &quot;Labrador&quot;, &quot;John A.Macdonald&quot; was an ocean-going icebreaker able to meet the most rigorous polar conditions. Her diesel-electric machinery of was arranged in three units transmitting power equally to each of three shafts.

Canada&#x27;s largest and most powerful icebreaker, the , was delivered in 1969. Her original three steam turbine, nine generator, and three electric motor system produces . A multi-year mid-life refit project (1987–1993) saw the ship get a new bow, and a new propulsion system. The new power plant consists of five diesels, three generators, and three electric motors, giving about the same propulsion power.

On 22 August 1994 &quot;Louis S. St-Laurent&quot; and became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole. The vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000; however, a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017. It is now planned to be kept in service through the 2020s pending the introduction of two new polar icebreakers, and , for the Coast Guard.

=== Nuclear-powered icebreakers ===
Russia currently operates all existing and functioning nuclear-powered icebreakers. The first one, NS , was launched in 1957 and entered operation in 1959, before being officially decommissioned in 1989. It was both the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered surface ship and the first nuclear-powered civilian vessel. 

The second Soviet nuclear icebreaker was NS , the lead ship of the . In service since 1975, she was the first surface ship to reach the North Pole, on August 17, 1977. Several nuclear-powered icebreakers were also built outside the Soviet Union. Two shallow-draft &quot;Taymyr&quot;-class nuclear icebreakers were built in Finland for the Soviet Union in the late 1980s.

In May 2007, sea trials were completed for the nuclear-powered Russian icebreaker NS . The vessel was put into service by Murmansk Shipping Company, which manages all eight Russian state-owned nuclear icebreakers. The keel was originally laid in 1989 by Baltic Works of Leningrad, and the ship was launched in 1993 as NS &quot;Ural&quot;. This icebreaker is intended to be the sixth and last of the &quot;Arktika&quot; class.

== Function ==
Today, most icebreakers are needed to keep trade routes open where there are either seasonal or permanent ice conditions. While the merchant vessels calling ports in these regions are strengthened for navigation in ice, they are usually not powerful enough to manage the ice by themselves. For this reason, in the Baltic Sea, the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and along the Northern Sea Route, the main function of icebreakers is to escort convoys of one or more ships safely through ice-filled waters. When a ship becomes immobilized by ice, the icebreaker has to free it by breaking the ice surrounding the ship and, if necessary, open a safe passage through the ice field. In difficult ice conditions, the icebreaker can also tow the weakest ships.

Some icebreakers are also used to support scientific research in the Arctic and Antarctic. In addition to icebreaking capability, the ships need to have reasonably good open-water characteristics for transit to and from the polar regions, facilities and accommodation for the scientific personnel, and cargo capacity for supplying research stations on the shore. Countries such as Argentina and South Africa, which do not require icebreakers in domestic waters, have research icebreakers for carrying out studies in the polar regions.

As offshore drilling moves to the Arctic seas, icebreaking vessels are needed to supply cargo and equipment to the drilling sites and protect the drillships and oil platforms from ice by performing ice management, which includes for example breaking drifting ice into smaller floes and steering icebergs away from the protected object. In the past, such operations were carried out primarily in North America, but today Arctic offshore drilling and oil production is also going on in various parts of the Russian Arctic.

The United States Coast Guard uses icebreakers to help conduct search and rescue missions in the icy, polar oceans. United States icebreakers serve to defend economic interests and maintain the nation&#x27;s presence in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the icecaps in the Arctic continue to melt, there are more passageways being discovered. These possible navigation routes cause an increase of interests in the polar hemispheres from nations worldwide. The United States polar icebreakers must continue to support scientific research in the expanding Arctic and Antarctic oceans. Every year, a heavy icebreaker must perform Operation Deep Freeze, clearing a safe path for resupply ships to the National Science Foundation’s facility McMurdo in Antarctica. The most recent multi-month excursion was led by the &quot;Polar Star&quot; which escorted a container and fuel ship through treacherous conditions before maintaining the channel free of ice.

== Characteristics ==
=== Ice resistance and hull form ===

Icebreakers are often described as ships that drive their sloping bows onto the ice and break it under the weight of the ship. In reality, this only happens in very thick ice where the icebreaker will proceed at walking pace or may even have to repeatedly back down several ship lengths and ram the ice pack at full power. More commonly the ice, which has a relatively low flexural strength, is easily broken and submerged under the hull without a noticeable change in the icebreaker&#x27;s trim while the vessel moves forward at a relatively high and constant speed.

When an icebreaker is designed, one of the main goals is to minimize the forces resulting from crushing and breaking the ice, and submerging the broken floes under the vessel. The average value of the longitudinal components of these instantaneous forces is called the ship&#x27;s ice resistance. Naval architects who design icebreakers use the so-called &quot;h&quot;-&quot;v&quot;-curve to determine the icebreaking capability of the vessel. It shows the speed (&quot;v&quot;) that the ship is able to achieve as a function of ice thickness (&quot;h&quot;). This is done by calculating the velocity at which the thrust from the propellers equals the combined hydrodynamic and ice resistance of the vessel. An alternative means to determine the icebreaking capability of a vessel in different ice conditions such as pressure ridges is to perform model tests in an ice tank. Regardless of the method, the actual performance of new icebreakers is verified in full scale ice trials once the ship has been built.

In order to minimize the icebreaking forces, the hull lines of an icebreaker are usually designed so that the flare at the waterline is as small as possible. As a result, icebreaking ships are characterized by a sloping or rounded stem as well as sloping sides and a short parallel midship to improve maneuverability in ice. However, the spoon-shaped bow and round hull have poor hydrodynamic efficiency and seakeeping characteristics, and make the icebreaker susceptible to slamming, or the impacting of the bottom structure of the ship onto the sea surface. For this reason, the hull of an icebreaker is often a compromise between minimum ice resistance, maneuverability in ice, low hydrodynamic resistance, and adequate open water characteristics.

Some icebreakers have a hull that is wider in the bow than in the stern. These so-called &quot;reamers&quot; increase the width of the ice channel and thus reduce frictional resistance in the aftship as well as improve the ship&#x27;s maneuverability in ice. In addition to low friction paint, some icebreakers utilize an explosion-welded abrasion-resistant stainless steel ice belt that further reduces friction and protects the ship&#x27;s hull from corrosion. Auxiliary systems such as powerful water deluges and air bubbling systems are used to reduce friction by forming a lubricating layer between the hull and the ice. Pumping water between tanks on both sides of the vessel results in continuous rolling that reduces friction and makes progress through the ice easier. Experimental bow designs such as the flat Thyssen-Waas bow and a cylindrical bow have been tried over the years to further reduce the ice resistance and create an ice-free channel.

=== Structural design ===
Icebreakers and other ships operating in ice-filled waters require additional structural strengthening against various loads resulting from the contact between the hull of the vessel and the surrounding ice. As ice pressures vary between different regions of the hull, the most reinforced areas in the hull of an icegoing vessel are the bow, which experiences the highest ice loads, and around the waterline, with additional strengthening both above and below the waterline to form a continuous ice belt around the ship.

Short and stubby icebreakers are generally built using transverse framing in which the shell plating is stiffened with frames placed about apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the locally concentrated ice loads on the shell plating to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by web frames and bulkheads that carry the more spread-out hull loads. While the shell plating, which is in direct contact with the ice, can be up to thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight. Regardless of the strength, the steel used in the hull structures of an icebreaker must be capable of resisting brittle fracture in low ambient temperatures and high loading conditions, both of which are typical for operations in ice-filled waters.

If built according to the rules set by a classification society such as American Bureau of Shipping, Det Norske Veritas or Lloyd&#x27;s Register, icebreakers may be assigned an ice class based on the level of ice strengthening in the ship&#x27;s hull. It is usually determined by the maximum ice thickness where the ship is expected to operate and other requirements such as possible limitations on ramming. While the ice class is generally an indication of the level of ice strengthening, not the actual icebreaking capability of an icebreaker, some classification societies such as the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping have operational capability requirements for certain ice classes. Since the 2000s, International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) has proposed adopting an unified system known as the Polar Class (PC) to replace classification society specific ice class notations.

=== Power and propulsion ===
Since the Second World War, most icebreakers have been built with diesel-electric propulsion in which diesel engines coupled to generators produce electricity for propulsion motors that turn the fixed pitch propellers. The first diesel-electric icebreakers were built with direct current (DC) generators and propulsion motors, but over the years the technology advanced first to alternating current (AC) generators and finally to frequency-controlled AC-AC systems. In modern diesel-electric icebreakers, the propulsion system is built according to the power plant principle in which the main generators supply electricity for all onboard consumers and no auxiliary engines are needed. 

Although the diesel-electric powertrain is the preferred choice for icebreakers due to the good low-speed torque characteristics of the electric propulsion motors, icebreakers have also been built with diesel engines mechanically coupled to reduction gearboxes and controllable pitch propellers. The mechanical powertrain has several advantages over diesel-electric propulsion systems, such as lower weight and better fuel efficiency. However, diesel engines are sensitive to sudden changes in propeller revolutions, and to counter this mechanical powertrains are usually fitted with large flywheels or hydrodynamic couplings to absorb the torque variations resulting from propeller-ice interaction.

The 1969-built Canadian polar icebreaker CCGS &quot;Louis S. St-Laurent&quot; was one of the few icebreakers fitted with steam boilers and turbogenerators that produced power for three electric propulsion motors. It was later refitted with five diesel engines, which provide better fuel economy than steam turbines. Later Canadian icebreakers were built with diesel-electric powertrain.

Two Polar-class icebreakers operated by the United States Coast Guard, have a combined diesel-electric and mechanical propulsion system that consists of six diesel engines and three gas turbines. While the diesel engines are coupled to generators that produce power for three propulsion motors, the gas turbines are directly coupled to the propeller shafts driving controllable pitch propellers. The diesel-electric power plant can produce up to while the gas turbines have a continuous combined rating of .

The number, type and location of the propellers depends on the power, draft and intended purpose of the vessel. Smaller icebreakers and icebreaking special purpose ships may be able to do with just one propeller while large polar icebreakers typically need up to three large propellers to absorb all power and deliver enough thrust. Some shallow draught river icebreakers have been built with four propellers in the stern. Nozzles may be used to increase the thrust at lower speeds, but they may become clogged by ice. Until the 1980s, icebreakers operating regularly in ridged ice fields in the Baltic Sea were fitted with first one and later two bow propellers to create a powerful flush along the hull of the vessel. This considerably increased the icebreaking capability of the vessels by reducing the friction between the hull and the ice, and allowed the icebreakers to penetrate thick ice ridges without ramming. However, the bow propellers are not suitable for polar icebreakers operating in the presence of harder multi-year ice and thus have not been used in the Arctic.

Azimuth thrusters remove the need of traditional propellers and rudders by having the propellers in steerable gondolas that can rotate 360 degrees around a vertical axis. These thrusters improve propulsion efficiency, icebreaking capability and maneuverability of the vessel. The use of azimuth thrusters also allows a ship to move astern in ice without losing manoeuvrability. This has led to the development of double acting ships, vessels with the stern shaped like an icebreaker&#x27;s bow and the bow designed for open water performance. In this way, the ship remains economical to operate in open water without compromising its ability to operate in difficult ice conditions. Azimuth thrusters have also made it possible to develop new experimental icebreakers that operate sideways to open a wide channel through ice.

====Nuclear-powered====

The steam-powered icebreakers were resurrected in the late 1950s when the Soviet Union commissioned the first nuclear-powered icebreaker, &quot;Lenin&quot;, in 1959. It had a nuclear-turbo-electric powertrain in which the nuclear reactor was used to produce steam for turbogenerators, which in turn produced electricity for propulsion motors. Starting from 1975, the Russians commissioned six &quot;Arktika&quot;-class nuclear icebreakers. Soviets also built a nuclear-powered icebreaking cargo ship, &quot;Sevmorput&quot;, which had a single nuclear reactor and a steam turbine directly coupled to the propeller shaft. Russia, which remains the sole operator of nuclear-powered icebreakers, is currently building Project 22220 icebreakers to replace the aging &quot;Arktika&quot; class. The first vessel of this type entered service in 2020.

===Resonance method===

A hovercraft can break ice by the resonance method. This causes the ice and water to oscillate up and down until the ice suffers sufficient mechanical fatigue to cause a fracture.

<text>David Attell (born January 18, 1965) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and writer best known as the host of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Insomniac with Dave Attell.&quot;

==Early life==
Attell was born in the New York City borough of Queens to a Jewish family. He was raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island. He graduated from South Side High School.

After graduating from New York University in 1987 with a degree in communications, Attell began performing at open-mic nights.

==Career==
Attell&#x27;s first appearance on television was in 1988 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Stand-Up Spotlight,&quot; which also featured early appearances by Lewis Black, Margaret Cho, Jeff Garlin, Jay Mohr and Wanda Sykes.

On November 23, 1993, he made his first appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The appearance was seen by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels, who then recruited Attell to be a writer and occasional performer on &quot;SNL&quot;. Attell can be seen behind Chris Farley during the &quot;Rudy Giuliani Inauguration&quot; sketch. Attell worked on the show for the 1993–94 season.

In 1995, Attell was featured on two HBO specials alongside up-and-comers Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle. He was a featured performer on the 1995 &quot;Young Comedians Special&quot; hosted by Garry Shandling. He was given his own 60-minute special on the channel&#x27;s &quot;HBO Comedy Showcase.&quot; Subsequently, Attell was also given an episode of &quot;HBO Comedy Half-Hour&quot; in 1997. Attell&#x27;s first one-hour special, &quot;Dave Attell: Captain Miserable&quot; aired December 8, 2007, on HBO.

His comedy special &quot;Dave Attell: Road Work&quot; aired 2014 on Comedy Central.

In 1995 and 1997, Attell appeared on &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot;.

In 1999, the network issued Attell an installment in the second season of &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot; series. The same year the network signed him as a regular commentator to its satirical news series &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, on which he appeared for three years. Attell&#x27;s commentary segment was called &quot;The Ugly American&quot;. He returned for the finale episode of host Jon Stewart&#x27;s tenure.

In 2001, the television series &quot;Insomniac with Dave Attell&quot; premiered on Comedy Central. Attell described it as &quot;&quot;Wild on E!&quot; for Ugly People&quot;.

In 2003, Attell began appearing on &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot;. The show featured many of the performers he works with at the New York City comedy club the Comedy Cellar and is based on the conversations they would have off-stage at the Olive Tree Cafe, the restaurant above the club.

Attell appeared on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh&quot; in 2007. In 2008, Attell began hosting &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot; for Comedy Central. Like the 1970s version, the show had a rotating panel of celebrity judges grading unusual acts.

In May 2008, Attell announced a casting call on his MySpace page for Comedy Central&#x27;s relaunch of &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. Attell was host, along with Greg Fitzsimmons serving as head writer on the series. However, &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot; aired only from July to September 2008.

In January 2010, he co-hosted the AVN Awards show, along with porn actresses Kirsten Price and Kayden Kross; and again in 2012 with co-hostesses Sunny Leone and Bree Olson.

Attell returned to television on Showtime beginning October 20, 2011, in &quot;Dave&#x27;s Old Porn&quot;, a TV series in which Attell views and jokes about retro 1970s and 1980s pornographic films with different guest comedians. Typically, during a given show, Attell and his guest view clips that give an overview of a particular retro porn star&#x27;s career. Near the end of the show, that particular actor appears and also comments on clips from some of their films.

In April 2014, Comedy Central premiered &quot;Comedy Underground with Dave Attell&quot;, a late-night stand-up comedy show taped live in New York.

In 2018 he toured with Jeff Ross on the Bumping Mics Tour. Over the last three days of the tour they taped a three-part documentary series, &quot;Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross &amp; Dave Attell&quot; for Netflix. Interspersed footage showcases the duo&#x27;s interactions both off-stage and on as they return to the Comedy Cellar, where a spontaneous first performance marked the birth of their ensemble act.

In 2024 Attell released the Netflix comedy special &quot;Dave Attell: Hot Cross Buns&quot;.

==Personal life==
Attell has been sober since the late 2000s.

<doc id="483071" wikidata="Q1125856" url="?curid=483071" title="Harriet Lee (writer)">
<text>Harriet Lee was an English writer and novelist, born in London in 1757, and died near Bristol at Clifton, England, on August 1, 1851. Her father, John Lee, was an actor and theatrical manager who died in 1781, her mother, name unknown, was also an actress. Additionally, she was the sister of Sophia Lee (1750–1824), a notable dramatist.

==Life==
Lee was born in London in 1757. After the death of her father, John Lee, in 1781, she helped her sister, Sophia Lee, manage a private school in Belvedere House, Bath.

In 1786, she published &quot;The Errors of Innocence,&quot; a novel broken up into five volumes, written in epistolary form. She also wrote a comedy, called &quot;The New Peerage,&quot; which was performed at Drury Lane on November 10, 1787. It had a prologue written by Richard Cumberland. Although it was performed nine times, it was not successful enough to encourage her to continue writing for the stage. John Genest described it as &quot;&#x27;on the whole, a poor play&quot;&#x27;. It was published with a dedication to Thomas King, the actor who had taken the chief role.

&quot;Clara Lennox,&quot; a two-volume-novel, was published in 1797 and translated into French the following year. The five volumes of Lee&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; were published between 1797 and 1805. In 1798, she published a play, called &quot;The Mysterious Marriage,&quot; in three acts, It was also called &quot;The Heirship of Rosalva.&quot; It has never been staged.

Before 1798, William Godwin met Lee during a ten-day visit in Bath. He was impressed with her conversation and, in a letter he sent to Lee after their meeting, stated &quot;There are so few persons in the world that have excited that degree of interest in my mind which you have excited&quot;. He had been determined to offer her a marriage proposal. Lee found the self-absorption in Godwin&#x27;s letter distasteful, and she chastised him with a frank response. From April to August 1798, they carried out a correspondence. Godwin again visited Bath at the end of 1798 and met with Lee. She ultimately decided that his religious opinions made a happy union impossible. She thought this because Godwin is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism and the first modern proponent of anarchism. Her last letter, sent on 7 August 1798, expressed a hope that friendly relations might be maintained; and Godwin sent letters to her at a later date criticizing some of her literary productions.

Among her friends were the novelists Jane and Anna Maria Porter, who lived in Bristol, and Thomas Lawrence. Allegedly, Sophia and Harriet Lee were the first to predict the future eminence of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who presented to them portraits by himself of Mrs. Siddons, John Kemble, and General Paoli. Samuel Rogers mentions meeting Harriet Lee in 1792. She lived to ninety-four, remaining lively, clear-minded, and kind until her death. She died in Clifton, Bristol, on 1 August 1851.

==Influence on Byron==

&quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (1797–1805), Lee&#x27;s best-known work, consists of twelve stories, with a common theme of travellers thrown together by untoward accident - modelled on Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s well-known work of the same name. The book fell into the hands of Lord Byron when he was a boy. He wrote in the preface to Werner, regarding one of the tales, &quot;Kruitzner, &#x27;When I was young (about fourteen, I think), I first read this tale, which made a deep impression upon me, and may, indeed, be said to contain the germ of much that I have since written.&quot;&#x27; In 1821 Byron dramatized &#x27;Kruitzner,&#x27; and published it in 1822 under the title of &#x27;Werner, or the Inheritance.&#x27; In the preface he fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Harriet Lee&#x27;s story, stating that he adopted its characters, place, and even its language. Lee had already dramatized her story at an earlier date, under the title of &quot;The Three Strangers&quot; and on the publication of Byron&#x27;s dramatic version she sent her play to the Covent Garden Theatre (November 1822); but although the piece was accepted, the performance was postponed by her own wish till 10 Dec. 1825, when it was acted four times. The cast included James Prescott Warde, Charles Kemble, and Mrs. Chatterley. John Genest describes it as &#x27;far from bad.&#x27; It was published in 1826.

<text>Charlotte Dacre (17?, born Charlotte King, was a British Gothic novelist, and poet. Most references today are given as Charlotte Dacre, but she first wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Rosa Matilda&quot; and later adopted a second pseudonym to confuse her critics. She became Charlotte Byrne upon her marriage to Nicholas Byrne in 1815.

==Life==
Dacre was one of three legitimate children of John King, born Jacob Rey (c. 1753–1824), a Jewish moneylender of Portuguese Sephardic origin, who was also a blackmailer and a radical political writer well known in London society. Her father divorced her mother, Sarah King (née Lara), under Jewish law in 1784, before setting up home with the dowager Countess of Lanesborough. Dacre had a sister named Sophia, also a writer, and a brother named Charles.

Charlotte Dacre married Nicholas Byrne, a widower, on 1 July 1815. She already had three children with him: William Pitt Byrne (born 1806), Charles (born 1807) and Mary (born 1809). He was an editor and future partner of London&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Post&quot; newspaper where the author Mary Robinson was the poetry editor and an influence on a young Charlotte Dacre, who began her writing career by contributing poems to the &quot;Morning Post&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Rosa Matilda.&quot;

She died on 7 November 1825, in Lancaster Place, London, after a long and painful illness.

In 1798 Charlotte King published with her sister Sophia a volume of Gothic verses, &quot;Trifles of Helicon&quot;, and dedicated it to her bankrupt father to show &#x27;the education you have afforded us has not been totally lost&#x27;. She used some of the poems from &quot;Trifles of Helicon&quot; in &quot;Hours of Solitude&quot; (1805), published under the pseudonym Charlotte Dacre, which confirms the identity between Dacre and King. She wrote verses for the &quot;Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Morning Herald&quot; under the name Rosa Matilda. Also in 1805 she published &quot;The Confessions of the Nun of St. Omer&quot;, a Gothic tale of sexual repression and misbehaviour. In the preface Dacre claims the book was written at the age of eighteen and left untouched for three years during journeys abroad. She wrote a total of four novels: &quot;The Confessions of the Nun of St. Omer&quot; (1805), &quot;Zofloya, or the Moor&quot; (1806), &quot;The Libertine&quot; (1807), and &quot;The Passions&quot; (1811). 

Of her four major novels, &quot;Zofloya, or the Moor&quot; is the most well-known and sold well on its release in 1806. It has been translated into German and French. The novel follows the corruption of the strong and sexually ruthless heroine Victoria, and her gradual enslavement to the charismatic Moorish servant Zofloya (later revealed to be Satan).

==Influence==
In the literary world, Charlotte Dacre has remained in virtual obscurity for nearly two centuries. Yet her work was admired by some of the literary giants of her day and her novels influenced Percy Bysshe Shelley, who thought highly of her style and creative skills. She is believed to be one of the numerous targets of Lord Byron&#x27;s satirical poem &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;, mentioned in the lines:
:&quot;Far be&#x27;t from me unkindly to upbraid&quot;
:&quot;The lovely &#x27;s prose in masquerade,&quot;
:&quot;Whose strains, the faithful echoes of her mind,&quot;
:&quot;Leave wondering comprehension far behind.&quot;

<text>Alan Lee Keyes (born August 7, 1950) is an American politician, political scientist, and perennial candidate who served as the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs from 1985 to 1987. A member of the Republican Party, Keyes sought the nomination for President of the United States in 1996, 2000, and 2008.

A doctoral graduate of Harvard University, Keyes began his diplomatic career in the U.S. Foreign Service in 1979 at the United States consulate in Mumbai, India, and later in the American embassy in Zimbabwe. Keyes was appointed Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations by President Ronald Reagan and later as President Reagan&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, a position he held from November 13, 1985, until November 17, 1987; in his capacities as a U.N ambassador, Keyes was involved in the implementation of the Mexico City Policy.

Aside from his presidential runs, he was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Maryland against Paul Sarbanes in 1988 and Barbara Mikulski in 1992, as well as in Illinois against Barack Obama in 2004. Keyes lost all three elections by wide margins.

Keyes hosted a radio call-in show, &quot;The Alan Keyes Show: America&#x27;s Wake-Up Call&quot;, from 1994 until 1998 on WCBM. The show was briefly simulcast by National Empowerment Television. In 2002, he briefly hosted a television commentary show on the MSNBC cable network, &quot;Alan Keyes Is Making Sense&quot;. He is a long time columnist for &quot;World Net Daily&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born at the St. Albans Naval Hospital (now a VA Community Living Center) in St. Albans, Queens, Keyes is the fifth child of mother Gerthina (Quick) and father Allison L. Keyes, a U.S. Army sergeant and a teacher. Due to his father&#x27;s tours of duty, the Keyes family traveled frequently. Keyes lived in Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia and overseas in Italy.

After high school, Keyes attended Cornell University, where he was a member of the Cornell University Glee Club and The Hangovers. He studied political philosophy with American philosopher and essayist Allan Bloom and has said that Bloom was the professor who influenced him most in his undergraduate studies. Keyes has stated that he received death threats for opposing Vietnam war protesters who seized a campus building. Keyes has stated that a passage of Bloom&#x27;s book, &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;, refers to this incident, speaking of an African-American student &quot;whose life had been threatened by a black faculty member when the student refused to participate in a demonstration&quot; at Cornell. Shortly after this incident occurred, Keyes left Cornell and spent a year in Paris under a Cornell study-abroad program connected with Bloom.

Keyes continued his studies at Harvard University, where he resided in Winthrop House. Keyes completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in government in 1972, graduating magna cum laude. During his first year of graduate school, Keyes&#x27;s roommate was William Kristol. In 1988, Kristol ran Keyes&#x27;s unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in Maryland. Keyes earned his Ph.D. in government from Harvard in 1979, having written a dissertation on Alexander Hamilton and constitutional theory under Harvey C. Mansfield. Due to student deferments and a high draft number, Keyes was not drafted to serve in the Vietnam War. Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war, in which his father served two tours of duty. Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam, but he says he was supporting his father and his brothers, who were also fighting in the war.

==Early career==

=== Diplomat ===
A year before completing his doctoral studies, Keyes joined the United States Department of State as a protégé of Jeane Kirkpatrick. In 1979, he was assigned to the consulate in Mumbai, India. The following year, Keyes was sent to serve at the embassy in Zimbabwe.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Keyes as Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1985, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, a position he held until 1987. His stay at the UN provoked some controversy, leading &quot;Newsday&quot; to say &quot;he has propounded the more unpopular aspects of US policy with all the diplomatic subtlety of the cannon burst in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 Overture.&quot; He also served on the staff of the National Security Council.

At a fundraiser for Keyes&#x27;s senate campaign, President Reagan spoke of Keyes&#x27;s time as an ambassador, saying that he &quot;did such an extraordinary job ... defending our country against the forces of anti-Americanism.&quot; Reagan continued, &quot;I&#x27;ve never known a more stout-hearted defender of a strong America than Alan Keyes.&quot; In 1987 Keyes was appointed a resident scholar for the American Enterprise Institute. His principal research for AEI was diplomacy, international relations, and self-government.

Following government service, Ambassador Keyes was President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) from 1989 to 1991, and founded CAGW&#x27;s National Taxpayers&#x27; Action Day. In 1991, he served as Interim President of Alabama A&amp;M University, in Huntsville, Alabama.

===Role in the Reagan administration===
Among the U.S. delegation to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman. In that capacity, Keyes negotiated the language of the Mexico City Policy to withhold federal funds from international organizations that support abortion. Additionally, Keyes fought against an Arab-backed UN resolution calling for investigation of Israeli settlements. The measure passed, 83–2, with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. voting against it. Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the U.S. at the 1985 Women&#x27;s Conference in Nairobi.

During his time at the United States Department of State, Keyes defended the Reagan policy of not imposing economic sanctions on South Africa as punishment for apartheid, claiming that comprehensive U.N. sanctions could result in the loss of 2 million jobs for Black South Africans.

==Political career==
===1988 Senate election===
In 1988, Keyes was drafted by the Maryland Republican Party to run for the United States Senate, and received 38 percent of the vote against victorious incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes.

===1992 Senate election===
Four years later, he ran again for the Senate from Maryland, coming in first in a field of 13 candidates in the Republican primary. Against Democrat Barbara Mikulski, he received 29 percent in the general election.

During the 1992 election, Keyes attracted controversy when he took an $8,463 (~$ in )/month salary from his campaign fund.

===1996 presidential election===
Keyes sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. In public debates, he asked other candidates about abortion. Many Republican leaders saw this as unnecessary and divisive. Keyes was particularly critical of Clinton during his campaign, saying, &quot;This guy lies, but he lies with passion.&quot; He questioned whether a Republican candidate who is truthful, yet cold and heartless, had a chance to win against the incumbent. Keyes was especially critical of Pat Buchanan, once saying during an interview on the &quot;Talk from the Heart&quot; program with Al Kresta that Buchanan had a &quot;black heart.&quot;

Keyes&#x27;s entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan was well known as ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and &quot;cultural war&quot; to the center of public policy debates. Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained by Atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited. He was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20 minutes later by Atlanta&#x27;s mayor at the time, Bill Campbell.

===2000 presidential election===


Keyes again campaigned for the Republican nomination in the 2000 primaries on an anti-abortion, family values, tax reform plank. In Iowa, he finished 3rd, drawing 14 percent in a crowded field. He stayed in the race after the early rounds and debated the two remaining candidates, John McCain and George W. Bush, in a number of nationally televised debates. He finished second in 8 primaries. His best showing in the presidential primaries was in Utah, where he received 20 percent of the vote. He was also noted for jumping into a mosh pit during a Rage Against the Machine song during the Iowa caucus as part of a segment on Michael Moore&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;.

===2004 Senate election===

On August 8, 2004—with 86 days to go before the general election—the Illinois Republican Party drafted Alan Keyes to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate, after the Republican nominee, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a sex scandal, and other potential draftees (most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka) declined to run. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot; called Keyes a &quot;carpetbagger&quot; since he &quot;had never lived in Illinois.&quot; When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton, he called her campaign &quot;pure and planned selfish ambition&quot;, but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party. &quot;You are doing what you believe to be required by your respect for God&#x27;s will, and I think that that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing in Illinois&quot;.

Keyes, who opposes abortion in all cases &quot;except as an inadvertent result of efforts to save the mother&#x27;s life&quot;, said in a September 7, 2004 news conference that Jesus Christ would not vote for Obama because of votes that Obama—then a member of the Illinois Senate Judiciary committee and a lecturer in constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School—cast in 2001 against a package of three anti-abortion bills that Obama argued were too broad and unconstitutional. The legislation, which provided &quot;that a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person,&quot; passed the Republican-controlled Illinois Senate, but failed to pass out of the Democratic-controlled Illinois House Judiciary committee. After the election, Keyes declined to congratulate Obama, explaining that his refusal to congratulate Obama was &quot;not anything personal&quot;, but was meant to make a statement against &quot;extend[ing] false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line&quot; of reasonable propriety. He said that Obama&#x27;s position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line. &quot;I&#x27;m supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which I believe ultimately stands for ... a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I cannot do this. And I will not make a false gesture,&quot; Keyes said.

Keyes was also criticized for his views on homosexuality. In an interview with Michelangelo Signorile, a gay radio host, Keyes defined homosexuality as centering in the pursuit of pleasure, literally &quot;selfish hedonism&quot;. When Signorile asked if Mary Cheney, Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s lesbian daughter, fit the description and was therefore a &quot;selfish hedonist&quot;, Keyes replied, &quot;Of course she is. That goes by definition.&quot; Media sources picked up on the exchange, reporting that Keyes had &quot;trashed&quot;, &quot;attacked,&quot; and &quot;lashed out at&quot; Mary Cheney, and had called her a &quot;sinner&quot;—provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders. Keyes noted that it was an interviewer, not he, who brought up Mary Cheney&#x27;s name in the above incident, and he told reporters, &quot;You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize. The people asking me the question did so, and if that&#x27;s inappropriate, blame the media. Do not blame me.&quot;

During the campaign, Keyes outlined an alternative to reparations for slavery. His specific suggestion was that, for a period of one or two generations, African-Americans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax (though not from the FICA tax that supports Social Security). Keyes said the experiment &quot;would become a demonstration project for what I believe needs to be done for the whole country, which is to get rid of the income tax.&quot; He also called for the repeal of the 17th Amendment in order to require that U.S. senators be appointed by state legislatures, rather than being directly elected.

Keyes finished with 27% of the vote and won a small number of southern Illinois counties.



===2008 presidential election===


On June 5, 2007, We Need Alan Keyes for President was formed as a political action committee to encourage Keyes to enter the 2008 presidential election. On September 14, 2007, Keyes officially announced his candidacy in an interview with radio show host Janet Parshall. On September 17, 2007, Keyes participated in the &quot;Values Voter Debate&quot; streamed live on Sky Angel, the Values Voter website, and radio. In a straw poll of the attending audience, Keyes placed third among the invited candidates, after Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul. Keyes was excluded from the Republican CNN/YouTube debate on November 28, 2007. Keyes&#x27;s campaign called the exclusion &quot;arbitrary, unfair, and presumptuous,&quot; arguing that CNN was playing the role of &quot;gatekeeper&quot; for the presidential election.
On December 12, 2007, Keyes participated in the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;″s Republican presidential debate, televised nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This was the first major presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s pro-abortion rights position, as well as Mitt Romney&#x27;s recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don&#x27;t deliver&quot;. He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor&#x27;s position on abortion.

In the Iowa caucuses, Keyes did not appear on any of the election totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes&#x27;s decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes&#x27;s candidacy, making it difficult to run an effective campaign.

Keyes supports an amendment to the Constitution barring same-sex marriage. He stated he would not have gone to war in Iraq, but also said that the war was justified and defended President George W. Bush&#x27;s decision in one of his 2004 debates. Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.

After the early states, Keyes exclusively campaigned in Texas, where he finished with 0.60 percent of all votes cast.

Following Texas, the Keyes campaign moved to seeking the Constitution Party presidential nomination, but he continued to appear on several Republican ballots. On May 6, Keyes scored his best showing of the campaign by winning 2.7% for fourth place in North Carolina, earning him two delegates to the Republican National Convention.

Keyes first stated that he was considering leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, even though he was no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes&#x27;s campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party&#x27;s logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo in the form of a dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes&#x27;s intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party&#x27;s presidential nomination.

On April 15, Keyes confirmed his split from the Republican Party and his intention to explore the candidacy of the Constitution Party. He lost his bid for the party&#x27;s nomination, however, coming in second to 2004 CP vice presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin at the party&#x27;s national convention in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 26, 2008. During the convention, the party&#x27;s founder, Howard Phillips, gave a controversial speech in which he referred to Keyes as &quot;the Neocon candidate&quot; who &quot;lingered in the Republican Party until a week ago.&quot; Following the defeat, Keyes held an interview with Mike Ferguson in which he compared his defeat to an abortion. Later, Keyes told a group of his supporters that he was &quot;prayerfully considering&quot; making a continued bid for the presidency as an independent candidate, and asserted his refusal to endorse Baldwin&#x27;s candidacy.

Keyes later split from the Constitution Party; he and his supporters then formed America&#x27;s Independent Party, a faction of the American Independent Party for his presidential candidacy. America&#x27;s Independent Party gained the affiliation of a faction of California&#x27;s American Independent Party. However, the AIP ticket, which had Brian Rohrbough, father of a victim of the Columbine High School massacre, of Colorado as its vice presidential candidate, was only on the general election ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida.

In the general election held on November 4, 2008, Keyes received 47,694 votes nationally to finish seventh. About 86% (40,673) of the votes he received were cast in California.

==Media and advocacy==

Keyes has worked as a media commentator and talk show personality. In 1994, he began hosting a syndicated radio show called &quot;The Alan Keyes Show: America&#x27;s Wake-Up Call&quot; for Radio America from Arlington, Virginia. The show became simulcast on cable&#x27;s National Empowerment Television in 1997. Keyes also helped launch various web-based organizations—notably Renew America and The Declaration Foundation.

Keyes has served on the board of advisors for the Catholic League, a non-profit, Catholic advocacy group headed by William A. Donohue. In 1997, he was quoted as calling in that capacity the ABC television show &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; &quot;propaganda dressed up as entertainment, the way the Nazis used to make movies. The entertainment elite&#x27;s belief that there are no moral absolutes deeply contradicts the religious view of Christianity.&quot;

In 2002, he hosted a live television commentary show, &quot;Alan Keyes Is Making Sense&quot;, on the MSNBC cable news channel. The network canceled the show in July, citing poor ratings. The cancellation triggered a boycott led by Jewish education website Mesora.org The show was unsympathetic to supporters of the al-Aqsa Intifadah—whom Keyes frequently debated on the program—and supported the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians. The show also featured critical discussion of homosexuality and of priests accused in the Catholic Church sex abuse scandals. The last episode was broadcast on June 27, 2002. As a result of Keyes&#x27;s strong advocacy of Israel on his MSNBC show, in July 2002 the state of Israel awarded him a special honor &quot;in appreciation of his journalistic endeavors and his integrity in reporting&quot; and flew him in to meet Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

In August 2003, Keyes came out in defense of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, citing both the U.S. Constitution and the Alabama constitution as sanctioning Moore&#x27;s (and Alabama&#x27;s) authority to publicly display the Ten Commandments in the state&#x27;s judicial building, in defiance of a court order from U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson. Although the monument was ultimately removed by state authorities, the issue impelled Keyes to spend the next year advocating his understanding of the Constitution&#x27;s protection of the right of states to display monuments that reflect the religious sentiments of the people in their states. As a result, he published an essay describing his rationale titled &quot;On the establishment of religion: What the Constitution really says.&quot;

In early 2005, Keyes sought to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, arguing that Schiavo&#x27;s life was protected by the Florida constitution, and that Governor Jeb Bush had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions. He attempted to meet with Bush to discuss the provisions of Florida law that authorized the governor to order Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tubes reinserted—something Bush claimed he wished to do, but for which he said he lacked authority—but the governor declined to meet with Keyes. Keyes subsequently wrote an essay directed openly at Governor Bush titled &quot;Judicial review and executive responsibility&quot;, days after Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube had been removed.

Keyes appeared in the 2006 mockumentary film &quot;Borat&quot; as an unwitting interviewee of Borat Sagdiyev (a character portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen).

In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for instituting same-sex marriage entirely on his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or authority to do so under Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney&#x27;s actions, which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and of the limitations of the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, in compliance with the court ruling. Commenting on the issue, Keyes asked rhetorically, &quot;Since the legislature has not acted on the subject, you might be wondering how it is that homosexuals are being married in Massachusetts. It&#x27;s because Mitt Romney, who is telling people he&#x27;s an opponent of same-sex marriage, forced the justices of the peace and others to perform same-sex marriage, all on his own, with no authorization or requirement from the court. Tells you how twisted our politicians have become.&quot;
On May 8, 2009, Keyes and 21 others were arrested while protesting President Barack Obama&#x27;s commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame. Keyes was charged with trespassing and released on $250 bond. He was arrested a second time on May 16.

In 2010, About.com, owned by The New York Times Company, named Keyes one of the top 20 conservatives to follow on Twitter.

During the time of the 2016 presidential election, Keyes emerged as a strong critic of Donald Trump. He criticized many conservative Christians for supporting &quot;a candidate whose life could be used to illustrate the deceitfully seductive quality of sin summarized in the phrase &#x27;the glamour of evil.&#x27;&quot; After Trump&#x27;s election, Keyes both criticized and praised Trump and various policies he pursued.

Keyes has actively promoted the use of Miracle Mineral Supplement (MMS) in both the United States and Uganda. One of the products featured by Keyes, made by a company called Genesis II, had its sales blocked in April 2020 by a federal court order.

== Personal life ==
Keyes is married to Jocelyn Marcel Keyes, who is of Indian descent and is from Calcutta. They have three children: Francis, Maya, and Andrew. Keyes is a traditional Catholic and a third-degree Knight of Columbus. He was also a close friend of Brazilian philosopher Olavo de Carvalho.

In 2005, at the age of nineteen, Keyes&#x27; daughter, Maya Marcel-Keyes, publicly announced she was a lesbian. At the time, Marcel-Keyes told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that her father had thrown her out of his apartment, stopped speaking to her, and stopped paying for her education. Marcel-Keyes also stated that her family had taken these steps after she attended a demonstration against President George W. Bush and asserted that her father &quot;cut her off&quot; because she is a &quot;&#x27;liberal queer&#x27;&quot;. In October 2007, Alan Keyes contradicted reports that he had disowned his daughter, stating that to do so would be &quot;wrong in the eyes of God.&quot; However, Keyes maintained that he would not give his approval to Marcel-Keyes&#x27;s homosexuality and contended that he must &quot;stand for the truth Jesus Christ represents&quot;.

==Obama citizenship lawsuit==
On November 14, 2008, Keyes filed a lawsuit—naming as defendants California Secretary of State Deborah Bowen, President-elect Barack Obama, Vice President-elect Joe Biden, and California&#x27;s 55 Democratic electors—challenging Obama&#x27;s eligibility for the U.S. presidency. The suit requested that Obama provide documentation that he is a native citizen of the United States.

Following the inauguration, Keyes alleged that Obama had not been constitutionally inaugurated, refused to call him president, and called him a &quot;usurper&quot; and a &quot;radical communist&quot;.
Keyes also claimed that Obama&#x27;s birth certificate had been forged and he was not qualified to be president.

<text>Lucas Watzenrode (also, in German, &quot;Lukas&quot;; in Polish, &quot;Łukasz&quot;)(1400, in Thorn, Ermland – 1462, in Thorn) was the maternal grandfather of Nicolaus Copernicus.

==Life==
Lucas Watzenrode the Elder was registered in the Thorn citizen registry book (&quot;Thorner Bürgerbuch&quot;) as landowner, businessmen, judge, councilman, etc., living at &quot;Seglergasse&quot; in Thorn. In 1436, he married Katharina von Rüdiger. In 1448, he and other Thorn burghers are registered as having been summoned to the court at Limburg.

Lucas and his wife Katharina had a daughter, Barbara, who married Nicolas Kopernik. Barbara&#x27;s sister Christina married Tideman von Allen. Both sisters married in Thorn.

Lucas Watzenrode the Elder&#x27;s grandson became known as Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus had an uncle, his mother&#x27;s brother, also named Lucas Watzenrode (known as Lucas Watzenrode the Younger), who as Bishop of Ermland strongly supported the independence of Ermland and helped raise Nicolaus and his brother Andreas after their father&#x27;s death.

Christina and Tideman&#x27;s daughter Cordula von Allen married Reinhold Feldstedt, who was born in 1468 in Danzig and died in 1529 in Danzig. Their daughter Katharina Feldstedt married Herman Giese, born in 1523 in Danzig. A descendant was Tiedemann Giese, a famous bishop of Ermland.
