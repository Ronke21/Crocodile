<text>A birthday cake is a cake eaten as part of a birthday celebration. While there is no standard for birthday cakes, they are typically highly decorated layer cakes covered in frosting, often featuring birthday wishes (&quot;Happy birthdays&quot;) and the celebrant&#x27;s name. In many cultures, it is also customary to serve the birthday cake with small lit candles on top, especially in the case of a child&#x27;s birthday. The cake often accompanies the singing of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;. Variations include cupcakes, cake pops, pastries, and tarts.

==History==

Birthday cakes have been a part of birthday celebrations in Western European countries since the middle of the 19th century. However, the link between cakes and birthday celebrations may date back to ancient Roman times; in classical Roman culture, cakes were occasionally served at special birthdays and at weddings. These were circles made from flour and nuts, leavened with yeast, and sweetened with honey.

In Germany by the 18th century, the tradition of celebrating birthdays with a birthday cake and candles began. One of the most notable occasions where using a birthday cake with candles took form was during Count Ludwig von Zinzendorf of Marienborn&#x27;s birthday party in 1746 in Germany. His cake was said to be as big as an oven could make it, with candles stuck in it, marking the years of his age. From the 18th century, elaborate cakes continued to take form, having many aspects of the contemporary birthday cake, like multiple layers, icing, and decorations. However, these cakes were only available to the very wealthy. Birthday cakes became accessible to the lower class as a result of the industrial revolution and the spread of more materials and goods.

==Birthday candles and contemporary rites==

The practice of serving cake on birthdays is commonplace in many cultures. In contemporary Western cultures, birthday cakes for children are often topped with candles, secured with special holders or simply pressed down into the outer frosting. In the Anglosphere, the number of candles often corresponds to the age of the individual being celebrated, occasionally with one extra for luck. An increasingly popular alternative is to use candles shaped as the numeral digits of the celebrant&#x27;s age. Sparklers may also be used alongside or instead of the traditional wax candles.

The cake is usually presented with all the candles lit, at which point it is customary for the guests to sing Happy Birthday to You in unison, or an equivalent birthday song appropriate to the country. Upon the conclusion of the song, the celebrant is traditionally prompted to blow out the candles and make a wish, which is thought to come true if all the candles are extinguished in a single breath. Another common superstition holds that the wish must be made in silence, not to be shared with anyone else, or else it will not come true.

===Theories of origin===

Though the exact origin of the birthday candle ritual is unknown, there are multiple theories which try to explain this tradition.

One theory explaining the tradition of placing candles on birthday cakes is attributed to the early Greeks, who used candles to honor the goddess Artemis&#x27; birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. The link between her oversight of fertility and the birthday tradition of candles on cakes, however, has not been established.
In 18th century Germany, the history of candles on cakes can be traced back to Kinderfest, a birthday celebration for children. This tradition also makes use of candles and cakes. German children were taken to an auditorium-like space. There, they were free to celebrate another year in a place where Germans believed that adults protected children from the evil spirits attempting to steal their souls. In those times there was no tradition of bringing gifts to a birthday; guests would merely bring good wishes for the birthday person. However, if a guest did bring gifts it was considered to be a good sign for the person whose birthday it was. Later, flowers became quite popular as a birthday gift.
* In 1746, a large birthday festival was held for Count Ludwig von Zinzendorf at Marienborn near Büdingen. Andrew Frey described the party in detail and mentions, &quot;there was a Cake as large as any Oven could be found to bake it, and Holes made in the Cake according to the Years of the Person&#x27;s Age, every one having a Candle stuck into it, and one in the Middle.&quot;
* Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, having spent 24–30 August 1801 in Gotha as a guest of Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, recounts of his 52nd birthday on 28 August: &quot;when it was time for dessert, the prince&#x27;s entire livery in full regalia entered, led by the majordomo. He carried a generous-size torte with colorful flaming candles – amounting to some fifty candles – that began to melt and threatened to burn down, instead of there being enough room for candles indicating upcoming years, as is the case with children&#x27;s festivities of this kind.&quot; As the excerpt indicates, the tradition at the time was to place one candle on the cake for each year of the individual&#x27;s life, so that the number of candles on top of the cake would represent the age which some one had reached; sometimes a birthday cake would have some added candles &#x27;indicating upcoming years.&#x27;

A reference to the tradition of blowing out the candles was documented in Switzerland in 1881. Researchers for the &quot;Folk-Lore Journal&quot; recorded various &quot;superstitions&quot; among the Swiss middle class. One statement depicted a birthday cake as having lighted candles which correspond to each year of life. These candles were required to be blown out, individually, by the person who is being celebrated.

=== Bacteriology ===
In June 2017 researchers at Clemson University reported that some individuals deposit a large number of bacteria onto the cake frosting when blowing out the candles. They found that on average, the act increased the amount of bacteria by 14 times, but one of the researchers described this as &quot;not a big health concern&quot;.

==By culture==

There are many variations of sweets which are eaten around the world on birthdays. Different cultures have different unique birthday cake traditions.

=== Chinese ===
The Chinese birthday pastry is the () or (), a lotus-paste-filled bun made of wheat flour and shaped and colored to resemble a peach. Rather than serving one large pastry, each guest is served their own small .

=== Russian and Lithuanian ===
In Western Russia, birthday children are served fruit pies with a birthday greeting carved into the crusts. As well in Russia and Lithuania, rather than a birthday cake, Russian adolescents receive a pie with a sweet birthday message that is illustrated with icing on top of the birthday pie.

=== Swedish ===
The Swedish birthday cake is made like a pound cake that is often topped with marzipan and decorated with the national flag. Dutch birthday pastries are fruit tarts topped with whipped cream.

=== English ===
Traditionally an English birthday cake is infused with artifacts that signify importance and good luck when baking the cake. To illustrate, adding a coin into the baking of the cake can represent financial success for the birthday individual. Different artifacts within cake can be used to symbolize a wish for the birthday girl or boy.

=== Egyptian ===
Birthday parties in Egypt consist of two different birthday cakes for the birthday girl or boy. Often only one birthday cake has a set of birthday candles while the other is left untouched. While two birthday cakes are significant in Egyptian culture, other sweet treats can be seen at birthday parties such as cakes known as “ghettos”.

=== Israeli ===
In Israel, individuals celebrate their birthdays with candles on their birthday cakes that align with the number of years the birthday individual was born. As well an additional candle is added to the birthday cake to represent a candle for the following year.

=== American ===
In the United States, lighting a birthday candle in correlation to the age of the birthday recipient is mirrored off of German customs. As well, singing happy birthday songs has become engraved in American birthday culture while the candles on the birthday are lit. In the 20th century a birthday trend became evident in American culture where a birthday want or desire would only be achieved if the birthday recipient blew the candle in one exhale.

<text>The National Building Museum is a museum of architecture, design, engineering, construction, and urban planning in Northwest Washington, D.C., U.S. It was created by an act of Congress in 1980, and is a private non-profit institution. Located at 401 F Street NW, it is adjacent to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and the Judiciary Square Metro station. The museum hosts various temporary exhibits in galleries around the spacious Great Hall.

The building, completed in 1887, served as the Pension Building, housing the United States Pension Bureau, and hosted several presidential inaugural balls. It is centered around a high-columned interior central courtyard hall often used for various events. It is an important early large-scale example of Renaissance Revival architecture, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985.

==Pension Building==


The National Building Museum is housed in the former Pension Bureau building, a brick structure completed in 1887 and designed by Montgomery C. Meigs, the U.S. Army quartermaster general. It is notable for several architectural features, including the spectacular interior columns and a frieze, sculpted by Caspar Buberl, stretching around the exterior of the building and depicting Civil War soldiers in scenes somewhat reminiscent of those on Trajan&#x27;s Column as well as the Horsemen Frieze of the Parthenon. The vast interior, measuring 316 × 116 feet (96 × 35 m), has been used to hold inauguration balls; a Presidential Seal is set into the floor near the south entrance.

After the Civil War, the United States Congress passed legislation that greatly extended the scope of pension coverage for veterans and their survivors and dependents, notably their widows and orphans. The number of staff needed to implement and administer the new benefits system ballooned to over 1,500, and quickly required a new building from which to run it all. Meigs was chosen to design and construct the new building. He departed from the established Greco-Roman models that had been the basis of government buildings in Washington, D.C., until then and which continued after the Pension Building&#x27;s completion. Meigs based his design on Italian Renaissance precedents, notably Rome&#x27;s Palazzo Farnese and the Palazzo della Cancelleria.

Included in his design was a frieze sculpted by Caspar Buberl. Because a sculpture of that size was well out of Meigs&#x27;s budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes, totaling 69 feet (21 m) in length, which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous 1,200-foot (365-m) parade of over 1,300 figures. Because of the 28 sections&#x27; modification and mixture, it is only in careful examination that the frieze is seen to be the same figures repeated several times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as a good deal of the supply and quartermaster functions, for it was in that capacity that Meigs had served during the Civil War.

Meigs&#x27;s correspondence with Buberl reveals that Meigs insisted that a black teamster, who &quot;must be a negro, a plantation slave, freed by war&quot;, be included in the quartermaster panel. This figure was ultimately to assume a central position, over the building&#x27;s west entrance.

Built before modern artificial ventilation, the building was designed to maximize air circulation: all offices not only had exterior windows, but also opened onto the court, which was designed to admit cool air at ground level and exhaust hot air at the roof. Made of brick and tile, the stairs were designed for the limitations of disabled and aging veterans, having a gradual ascent with low steps. In addition, each step slanted slightly from back to front to allow easy drainage: a flight could be washed easily by pouring water from the top.

When Philip Sheridan was asked to comment on the building, his biting reply echoed the negative sentiment of much of the Washington establishment of the day: &quot;Too bad the damn thing is fireproof.&quot; A similar quote is also attributed to William Tecumseh Sherman, perhaps casting doubt on the truth of the Sheridan tale. Longtime Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore called the building a &quot;hideous architectural monstrosity.&quot;

The completed building, sometimes called &quot;Meigs Old Red Barn&quot;, required more than 15 million bricks, which, according to the wit of the day, were each counted by the parsimonious Meigs.

==Becoming a museum==

The building was used for federal government offices until the 1960s when it had fallen into a state of disrepair and was considered for demolition. After pressure from conservationists, the government commissioned a report by architect Chloethiel Woodard Smith of possible other uses for the building. Her 1967 report suggested a museum dedicated to the building arts. The building was then listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. At that time, the building was still in use as the local draft bureau office. In 1980, Congress created the National Building Museum as a private, non-profit institution. The building itself was formally renamed the National Building Museum in 1997.

Every year, the annual &quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; program was filmed at the museum, with the president and first lady, until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2015.

===Museum shop===
The National Building Museum&#x27;s gift shop was honored in 2007 as the &quot;Best Museum Store&quot; in the country by &quot;Niche&quot; magazine, &quot;Best All-Around Museum Shop&quot; in the region by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, a &quot;Top Shop&quot; by the &quot;Washingtonian&quot;, and named best museum shop in D.C. by &quot;National Geographic Traveler&#x27;s&quot; blog, Intelligent Travel, in July 2009. In 2010, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; included the National Building Museum in its story &quot;Museums with Amazing Gift Shops.&quot; The museum shop sells books about the built environment and an array of housewares, educational toys, watches, and items for an office, all with an emphasis on design.

==American politics==
On June 7, 2008, Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with a farewell rally inside the museum. On that occasion, Clinton memorably declared that &quot;if we can blast fifty women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House.&quot;

==Awards==
The National Building Museum presents three annual awards: the Honor Award for individuals and organizations who have made important contributions to the U.S.&#x27;s building heritage; the Vincent Scully Prize, which honors exemplary practice, scholarship, or criticism in architecture, historic preservation, and urban design; and the Henry C. Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction Technology, which recognizes outstanding leadership and innovation in the field of construction methods and processes.

==Outreach programs==
===Investigating Where We Live===

Investigating Where We Live is a summer program for teens from the DC metropolitan area. Students spend four weeks in teams equipped with cameras, and sketchbooks to discover the local communities. Students are given an introduction to photography and then investigate neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. Documenting history, landmarks, and residential areas, students assemble the community&#x27;s identity. The original photographs and writings are incorporated into an exhibition at the Museum. Since 1996, more than 500 students have participated in learning about different communities within the District of Columbia.
Upon completion of the program, participants:
* Receive a digital camera
* Develop relationships with professional photographers, designers, museum staff, and fellow participants
* Keep photographs for use in future projects, portfolios, or high school and college applications
* Fulfill community service requirements for school

Previous exhibits include &quot;Investigating Where We Live: Recapturing Shaw&#x27;s Legacy&quot; which taught high school students about DC&#x27;s Shaw neighborhood.

<text>Kiwibank Limited is a New Zealand state-owned bank and financial services provider. As of 2023, Kiwibank is the fifth-largest bank in New Zealand by assets, and the largest New Zealand-owned bank, with a market share of approximately 9%. In December 2023, the bank&#x27;s assets totaled about $35 billion.

Kiwibank was established in 2001 by the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand, following a proposal by then Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, to set up a locally-owned bank capable of competing with the Big Four Australian banks which dominated the domestic market. Initially, it operated as a subsidiary of New Zealand Post, with branches originally co-located within &quot;PostShops&quot; (post offices) to ensure nationwide accessibility.

== History ==
===Earlier state-owned banks===
Kiwibank is similar in some respects to an earlier post office-based bank owned by the New Zealand Government. The New Zealand Post Office Bank was established in 1867. In 1987, the bank was corporatised and separated from New Zealand Post and Telecom New Zealand to form a stand-alone company – PostBank. Then in 1989 PostBank was sold by the government to ANZ.

===Establishment period (2002–2010)===

Jim Anderton revealed in his valedictory speech that after the issue had previously been discussed by cabinet for months, he had spent three hours trying to convince then Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Annette King told Cullen: &quot;Michael, Jim&#x27;s beaten back every argument against the bank we&#x27;ve ever put up. For God&#x27;s sake, give him the bloody bank.&quot; Cullen replied: &quot;Oh, all right then.&quot;

In 2008, one analysis suggested that Kiwibank had contributed to increased competition in the New Zealand banking sector through lower fees. Additionally, by 2007, Kiwibank had achieved higher customer satisfaction ratings compared to the four major Australian-owned banks operating in New Zealand.
In 2008 Kiwibank unveiled an advertising campaign, &quot;Join The Movement&quot;, which portrayed foreign-owned competitors as enemy occupiers. The &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; called the campaign &quot;jingoistic&quot;.

===Since 2010===

Kiwibank announced an after tax profit of $21.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2011.

In 2012, Kiwibank celebrated its ten-year birthday. The advertising campaign used 10-year-old Kiwis pledging what they&#x27;re standing up for with New Zealand musician Neil Finn agreeing to the use of his song &quot;Can you hear us?&quot; re-recorded by Jeremy Redmore of Midnight Youth. It was the first time the artist had allowed one of his tracks to be used by a commercial entity. The proceeds from the first 20,000 downloads of the soundtrack went to the NZ Music Foundation of which Finn is patron.

In 2012, the bank also released an iPhone mobile banking app, following the roll out of a redesigned Kiwibank website. Standard &amp; Poor lowered Kiwibank&#x27;s credit rating one level from AA− to A+ (outlook stable) and Kiwibank reported a record after tax profit of $79.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2012.

In 2014, Kiwibank launched its &quot;Independence&quot; advertising campaign where it &quot;compares itself to anyone who has ever immigrated to New Zealand&quot;.

In 2016, New Zealand Post announced the successful completion of the sales of 25 percent of Kiwibank to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and 22 percent to the Accident Compensation Corporation. 

On 22 August 2022, the New Zealand Government purchased Kiwibank&#x27;s holdings company Kiwi Group Holdings for an estimated NZ$2.1 billion. As a result, the Government acquired full control of the state-owned bank from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, ACC, and New Zealand Post. In response to the Government&#x27;s purchase of Kiwibank, KiwiSaver providers opined that the Government could have offered to partially sell shares to the public. The opposition ACT Party&#x27;s leader David Seymour called for a partial sale of Kiwibank&#x27;s shares to pension funds. Similarly, the opposition National Party questioned the Labour Government&#x27;s ability to run Kiwibank.

In June 2024 the Commerce Commission filed 21 criminal charges against Kiwibank alleging systemic breaches of the Fair Trading Act 1986. 
The alleged breaches related to issues causing more than $7 million in overcharges to over 36,000 customers for fees and interest rates in relation to home loans, credit cards and overdrafts, over several years dating back to 2002. In mid July 2024, Kiwibank pleaded guilty to charges of &quot;systemic breaches&quot; of the Fair Trading Act 1986.

New Zealand Home Loans continues to grow offering an alternative to the traditional banking model and have a nationwide network of over 75 franchises.

In 2012, Kiwi Group Holdings (the parent company of Kiwibank) purchased Gareth Morgan Investments (GMI) for an undisclosed sum. In August 2013 GMI reached a milestone of $2 billion funds under management.

In 2015, Gareth Morgan Investments (GMI) was re-branded to Kiwi Wealth, offering global investment management and private portfolio services to retail high-net-worth, pension funds and institutional clients.

<text>Sderot (, , ; , sometimes Romanized as &quot;Sederot&quot;) is a western Negev city and former development town in the Southern District of Israel. In , it had a population of .

Sderot is located less than a mile from Gaza (the closest point is ), and is notable for having been a major target of Qassam rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. Between 2001 and 2008, rocket attacks on the city killed 13 people, wounded dozens, caused millions of dollars in damage and profoundly disrupted daily life. Although rocket fire subsided after the Gaza War (2008–09), the city has come under rocket attack on occasion since that time.

==Geography==
Sderot lies from the Gaza Strip and the town of Beit Hanoun.

==History==
===20th century===

The Israeli Negev Brigade had depopulated the area on which Sderot would be built on between the 2nd and 13th of May 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, expelling the 422 Muslim farmers there who cultivated citrus, bananas and cereals from the Palestinian village of Najd. The latter were relocated in Gaza as refugees. 

Sderot was founded in 1951 as a transit camp for Jewish immigrants, primarily from Kurdistan and Iran. The settlement initially housed 80 families and was originally called Gabim Dorot, before later being renamed Sderot, a symbolic nod to the numerous avenues of trees planted in the Negev to combat desertification and beautify the arid landscape. Like many localities in the Negev, a green motif was chosen in keeping with the Zionist vision of &quot;making the desert bloom.&quot;

The development served as part of a chain of settlements designed to block infiltration from Gaza. Permanent housing was completed three years later, in 1954.

From the mid-1950s, the town attracted many Moroccan Jews. Romanian Jewish immigrants also began settling in Sderot. In 1956, Sderot was recognized as a local council. In the 1961 census, North African immigrants, mostly from Morocco, made up 87% of the population, with 11% from Kurdistan.

Sderot absorbed another large wave of immigrants, from the former Soviet Union, during the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah. Immigrants from Ethiopia also arrived during this time, doubling its population. In 1996, it was declared a city. A number of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip were resettled in Sderot beginning in 1997 after cooperating with the Shin Bet.

===21st century===



From 2001, in the beginning stage of the Second Intifada, the city was a target for rockets from the Gaza Strip. Rocket fire intensified after the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005, with the city sustaining constant rocket fire from Qassam rockets launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

In May 2007, a significant increase in shelling from Gaza prompted the temporary evacuation of thousands of residents. By November 23, 2007, 6,311 rockets had fallen on the city. &quot;Yediot Ahronoth&quot; reported that during the summer of 2007, 3,000 of the city&#x27;s 22,000 residents (consisting mostly of the city&#x27;s key upper and middle class residents) left for other areas, out of Qassam rocket range. Russian billionaire Arcadi Gaydamak organised a series of relief programs for residents unable to leave.
On December 12, 2007, after more than 20 rockets landed in the Sderot area in a single day, including a direct hit to one of the main avenues, Sderot mayor Eli Moyal announced his resignation, citing the government&#x27;s failure to halt the rocket attacks. Moyal was persuaded to retract his resignation.

In a gesture of solidarity, El Al (Israel&#x27;s national airline) named one of its Boeing 777 passenger planes &quot;Sderot&quot; (4X-ECE).

In January 2008, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York organized a display of 4,200 red balloons outside the headquarters of the United Nations. Each balloon represented a Qassam rocket that had been fired into Sderot, where for years the town and its surrounding area have been under near-constant bombardment by thousands of rockets and mortar shells fired from Gaza. Consul David Saranga, who conceptualized the display, said he used the balloons as an opportunity to call upon the international community to stop ignoring what&#x27;s happening in Israel. The balloon display made headlines in New York City papers as well as international publications.

In January 2008, British journalist Seth Freedman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Sderot as a city of near-deserted streets and empty malls and cafes. In March 2008, the mayor said that the population had dropped by 10–15%, while aid organizations said the figure was closer to 25%. Many of the families that remained were those who could not afford to move out or were unable to sell their homes. Studies found that air raid sirens and explosions have caused severe psychological trauma in some residents. According to a study carried out at Sapir Academic College in 2007, some 75% of residents aged 4–18 were suffering from PTSD, including sleeping disorders and severe anxiety, in the wake of rocket attacks on the city, and 1,000 residents were receiving psychiatric treatment at the community mental health center. From mid-June 2007 to mid-February 2008, 771 rockets and 857 mortar bombs were fired at Sderot and the western Negev, an average of three or four each a day.

During the Gaza War in December 2008 and January 2009, between 50 and 60 rockets were fired at Sderot per week, causing about half the city&#x27;s residents to temporarily evacuate. The war ended regular rocket fire from Gaza and the city experienced a revitalization. By 2009, demand for apartments was outweighing supply, a new sports complex largely funded by donor aid had opened, a new shopping mall was being built, and the assistance that the city had received due to concern over the years of rocket fire meant that Sderot now had better community, educational, and recreational services than many other Negev development towns. The city sustained rocket fire on occasion over the following years, including during Operation Protective Edge.

In 2010, after a decline in charitable donations, the municipality revealed that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

In 2011, a Sderot resident filed a million dollar lawsuit against two Canadian organizations raising funds for a Canadian ship to join the Gaza flotilla. According to the lawyers, &quot;The Canadian Boat&#x27;s raison d&#x27;être is to aid and abet the terrorist organization that rules Gaza.&quot; The suit alleges that these actions violate Canadian laws that prohibit aid to terror groups.

In May 2019, the Israeli Air Force held a special flypast (aerial display) over Sderot (in addition to Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut flypast), in order to salute the residents of Sderot who suffer continuously from Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.

On October 7, 2023, Hamas gunmen attacked Sderot, engaging in firefights with Israeli police and civilians in the streets and occupying the town&#x27;s police station. About eighteen members of the Israeli police were killed during the fighting. Fighting continued through the night until security forces retook the police station, which was demolished in case more terrorists remained inside. Early estimates stated that at least 20 civilians were killed as they were waiting at bus stops, walking down the street, and driving in their cars. Of the 36,000 residents of the city, 90% were evacuated during the days after the massacre.

==== Sderot cinema ====
&quot;Sderot cinema&quot; is a name given to gatherings at a hill in Sderot, where over 50 locals would come to watch the bombing of the Gaza strip during the last four wars. The name was coined by a Danish journalist who snapped a photo of it and posted it on Twitter. Similar events happened in Operation Cast Lead in 2009, after which some critics decided to refer to the hill as &quot;Hill of Shame&quot;. Sderot residents have complained about the media portrayal.
==Demographics==
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2010 the city had a population of 21,900. The national makeup of the city was 94% Jewish, 5.5% other non-Arabs, and Arabs less than 1%. There were 10,600 males and 10,500 females. The population growth rate in 2010 was 0.5%.

==Economy==
In 2008, the average wage for a salaried worker in Sderot was .

Hollandia International, founded in 1981, a company that manufactures and exports high-end mattresses, moved its sole manufacturing center to Sderot in the 1990s. After 11 years there, it decided in 2008 to relocate due to rocket attacks that hit the city and the factory.

The Osem plant in Sderot, opened in 1981, is the region&#x27;s major employer, with 480 workers. 170 products are manufactured there, including Bamba, Bisli, Mana Hama instant noodle and rice dishes, instant soup powders, shkedei marak, ketchup and sauces.

The Menorah Candle factory located in Sderot exports Hanukkah candles all over the world.

Nestlé maintains a research and development facility in Sderot, established in 2002. Its production facilities for breakfast cereals are also located in Sderot.

Amdocs has a plant in the Sderot and an industrial zone is under development.

In 2012, the government approved nearly $59 million worth of economic benefits for Sderot to strengthen the economy, boost employment and subsidize psycho-social programs for the city&#x27;s residents.

==Culture==
An unusually high ratio of singers, instrumentalists, composers and poets have come from Sderot.

Several popular bands have been formed by musicians who practiced in Sderot&#x27;s bomb shelters as teenagers. As an immigrant town with high unemployment experiencing a dramatic musical success, as bands blend international sounds with the music of their Moroccan immigrant parents, it has been compared to Liverpool in the 1960s. Among the notable bands are Teapacks Knesiyat Hasekhel and Sfatayim. Well-known musicians from Sderot include Shlomo Bar, Kobi Oz, Haïm Ulliel and Smadar Levi.
The winner of the Israeli version of &quot;American Idol&quot; 2011 was Hagit Yaso, a local Sderot singer of Ethiopian origin.

Israeli poet Shimon Adaf was born in Sderot, as well as the actor and entertainer Maor Cohen. Adaf dedicated a poem to the city in his 1997 book &quot;Icarus&#x27; Monologue&quot;.

In 2007, Jewish-American documentary filmmaker Laura Bialis immigrated to Israel, and decided to settle in Sderot &quot;to find out what it means to live in a never-ending war, and to document the lives and music of musicians under fire&quot;. Her film &quot;&quot; focuses on young musicians living under the daily threat of Qassams.

Politically, the town leans heavily to the right.

==Transportation==

Sderot is accessible by Highway 34 and Route 232.

The Ashkelon–Beersheba railway, a new railway line which connected Sderot with Tel Aviv and Beersheba, was inaugurated in December 2013. The Sderot railway station located on the outskirts of the city at the southern entrance, was opened on December 24, 2013. It is the first in Israel to be armored against rocket fire.

==Education==

<text>Rufus C. Thomas, Jr. (March 26, 1917 – December 15, 2001) was an American rhythm-and-blues, funk, soul and blues singer, songwriter, dancer, DJ and comic entertainer from Memphis, Tennessee. He recorded for several labels, including Chess Records and Sun Records in the 1950s, before becoming established in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records. His dance records, including &quot;Walking the Dog&quot; (1963), &quot;Do the Funky Chicken&quot; (1969), and &quot;(Do the) Push and Pull&quot; (1970), were some of his most successful songs. According to the Mississippi Blues Commission, &quot;Rufus Thomas embodied the spirit of Memphis music perhaps more than any other artist, and from the early 1940s until his death . . . occupied many important roles in the local scene.&quot;

He began his career as a tap dancer, vaudeville performer, and master of ceremonies in the 1930s. He later worked as a disc jockey on radio station WDIA in Memphis, both before and after his recordings became successful. He remained active into the 1990s and as a performer and recording artist was often billed as &quot;The World&#x27;s Oldest Teenager&quot;. He was the father of the singers Carla Thomas (with whom he recorded duets) and Vaneese Thomas and the keyboard player Marvell Thomas.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in the rural community of Cayce, Mississippi, on the outskirts of Memphis, Tennessee, the son of a sharecropper. He moved with his family to Memphis around 1920. His mother was a &quot;church woman&quot;. Thomas made his debut as a performer at the age of six, playing a frog in a school theatrical production. By the age of 10, he was a tap dancer, performing on the streets and in amateur productions at Booker T. Washington High School, in Memphis. From the age of 13, he worked with Nat D. Williams, his high-school history teacher, who was also a pioneer black DJ at radio station WDIA and columnist for black newspapers, as a master of ceremonies at talent shows in the Palace Theater on Beale Street. After graduating from high school, Thomas attended Tennessee A&amp;I University for one semester, but economic constraints led him to leave to pursue a career as a full-time entertainer.

==Early career==
Thomas began performing in traveling tent shows. In 1936 he joined the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, an all-black revue that toured the South, as a tap dancer and comedian, sometimes part of a duo, Rufus and Johnny. He married Cornelia Lorene Wilson in 1940, at a service officiated by Rev. C. L. Franklin, the father of Aretha Franklin, and the couple settled in Memphis. Thomas worked a day job in the American Finishing Company textile bleaching plant, which he continued to do for over 20 years. He also formed a comedy and dancing duo, Rufus and Bones, with Robert &quot;Bones&quot; Couch, and they took over as MCs at the Palace Theater, often presenting amateur hour shows. One early winner was B.B. King, and others discovered by Thomas later in the 1940s included Bobby Bland and Johnny Ace.

In the early 1940s, Thomas began writing and performing his own songs. He regarded Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Gatemouth Moore as musical influences. He made his professional singing debut at the Elks Club on Beale Street, filling in for another singer at the last minute, and during the 1940s became a regular performer in Memphis nightclubs, such as Currie&#x27;s Club Tropicana. As an established performer in Memphis, aged 33 in 1950, Thomas recorded his first 78 rpm single, for Jesse Erickson&#x27;s small Star Talent label in Dallas, Texas. Thomas said, &quot;I just wanted to make a record. I never thought of getting rich. I just wanted to be known, be a recording artist. . . . [But] the record sold five copies and I bought four of them.&quot; The record, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be a Good Boy&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;m So Worried&quot;, gained a &quot;Billboard&quot; review, which stated that &quot;Thomas shows first class style on a slow blues&quot;. He also recorded for the Bullet label in Nashville, Tennessee, when he recorded with Bobby Plater&#x27;s Orchestra and was credited as &quot;Mr. Swing&quot;; the recordings were not recognised by researchers as being by Thomas until 1996. In 1951 he made his first recordings at Sam Phillips&#x27;s Sun Studio, for the Chess label, but they were not commercially successful.

He began working as a DJ at radio station WDIA in 1951, and hosted an afternoon R&amp;B show called &quot;Hoot and Holler&quot;. WDIA, featuring an African-American format, was known as &quot;the mother station of the Negroes&quot; and became an important source of blues and R&amp;B music for a generation, its audience consisting of white as well as black listeners. Thomas used to introduce his shows saying, &quot;I&#x27;m young, I&#x27;m loose, I&#x27;m full of juice, I got the goose so what&#x27;s the use. We&#x27;re feeling gay though we ain&#x27;t got a dollar, Rufus is here, so hoot and holler.&quot; He also used to lead tours of white teenagers on &quot;midnight rambles&quot; around Beale Street. Thomas claimed to be the first black DJ to play Elvis Presley records, which he did until the station program director made him stop due to segregation. Shortly thereafter, Thomas performed on stage with Elvis to an all-black audience and the audience stormed through to get to him. After that, the program director allowed Elvis songs to be played on WDIA.

His celebrity in the South was such that in 1953, at Sam Phillips&#x27;s suggestion, he recorded &quot;Bear Cat&quot; for Sun Records, an &quot;answer record&quot; to Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s R&amp;B hit &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. The record became the label&#x27;s first national chart hit, reaching number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. However, a copyright-infringement suit brought by Don Robey, the original publisher of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, nearly bankrupted the record label. After only one recording there, Thomas was one of the African-American artists released by Phillips, as he oriented his label more toward white audiences and signed Elvis Presley, who later recorded Thomas&#x27;s song &quot;Tiger Man&quot;. Thomas did not record again until 1956, when he made a single, &quot;I&#x27;m Steady Holdin&#x27; On&quot;, for the Bihari brothers&#x27; Meteor label; musicians on the record included Lewie Steinberg, later a founding member of Booker T and the MGs.

==Stax Records==
In 1960 he made his first recordings with his 17-year-old daughter Carla, for the Satellite label in Memphis, which changed its name to Stax the following year. The song, &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;, featuring a rhythm borrowed from Jesse Hill&#x27;s &quot;Ooh Poo Pa Doo&quot;, was a regional hit; the musicians included Thomas&#x27; son Marvell on keyboards, Steinberg, and the 16-year-old Booker T. Jones. The record&#x27;s success led to Stax gaining production and distribution deal with the much larger Atlantic Records.

Rufus Thomas continued to record for the label after Carla&#x27;s record &quot;Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)&quot; reached the national R&amp;B chart in 1961. He had his own hit with &quot;The Dog&quot;, a song he had originally improvised in performance based on a Willie Mitchell bass line, complete with imitations of a barking dog. The 1963 follow-up, &quot;Walking the Dog&quot;, engineered by Tom Dowd of Atlantic, became one of his most successful records, reaching #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. He became the first, and still the only, father to debut in the Top 10 after his daughter had first appeared there. The song was recorded in early 1964 by the Rolling Stones on their debut album, and was a minor UK chart hit for Merseybeat group the Dennisons later that year.

As well as recording and appearing on radio and in clubs, Thomas continued to work as a boiler operator in the textile plant, where he claimed the noises sometimes suggested musical rhythms and lyrics to him, before he finally gave up the job in 1963, to focus on his role as a singer and entertainer. He recorded a series of novelty dance tracks, including &quot;Can Your Monkey Do the Dog&#x27;&quot; and &#x27;&quot;Somebody Stole My Dog&quot; for Stax, where he was often backed by Booker T. &amp; the MGs or the Bar-Kays. He also became a mentor to younger Stax stars, giving advice on stage moves to performers like Otis Redding, who partnered daughter Carla on record.

After &quot;Jump Back&quot; in 1964, the hits dried up for several years, as Stax gave more attention to younger artists and musicians. However, in 1970 he had another big hit with &quot;Do the Funky Chicken&quot;, which reached #5 on the R&amp;B chart, #28 on the pop chart, and #18 in Britain where it was his only chart hit. Thomas improvised the song while performing with Willie Mitchell&#x27;s band at a club in Covington, Tennessee, including a spoken word section that he regularly used as a &quot;shtick&quot; as a radio DJ: &quot;Oh I feel so unnecessary - this is the kind of stuff that makes you feel like you wanna do something nasty, like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt right down front.&quot; The recording was produced by Al Bell and Tom Nixon, and used the Bar-Kays, featuring guitarist Michael Toles. Thomas continued to work with Bell and Nixon as producers, and later in 1970 had his only number 1 R&amp;B hit [and his second-highest pop charting record] with another dance song, &quot;Do the Push and Pull&quot;. A further dance-oriented release in 1971, &quot;The Breakdown&quot;, climbed to number 2 R&amp;B and number 31 Pop. In 1972, he featured in the Wattstax concert, and he had several further, less successful, hits before Stax collapsed in 1976.

==Later career==
Thomas continued to record and toured internationally, billing himself as &quot;The World&#x27;s Oldest Teenager&quot; and describing himself as &quot;the funkiest man alive&quot;. He &quot;drew upon his vaudeville background to put [his songs] over on stage with fancy footwork that displayed remarkable agility for a man well into his fifties&quot;, and usually performed &quot;while clothed in a wardrobe of hot pants, boots and capes, all in wild colors.&quot;

He continued as a DJ at WDIA until 1974, and worked for a period at WLOK before returning to WDIA in the mid-1980s to co-host a blues show. He appeared regularly on television and recorded albums for various labels. Thomas performed regularly at the Porretta Soul Festival in Italy; the outdoor amphitheater in which he performed was later renamed Rufus Thomas Park.

He played an important part in the Stax reunion of 1988, and appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Mystery Train&quot;, Robert Altman&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, and D. A. Pennebaker’s documentary &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;. Thomas released an album of straight-ahead blues, &quot;That Woman Is Poison!&quot;, with Alligator Records in 1988, featuring saxophonist Noble &quot;Thin Man&quot; Watts. In 1996, he and William Bell headlined at the Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1997, he released an album, &quot;Rufus Live!&quot;, on Ecko Records. In 1998, he hosted two New Year&#x27;s Eve shows on Beale Street.

In 1997, to commemorate his 80th birthday, the City of Memphis renamed a road off Beale Street, close to the old Palace Theater, as Rufus Thomas Boulevard. He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1992, and a lifetime achievement award from ASCAP in 1997. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Death and legacy==

He died of heart failure in 2001, at the age of 84, at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis. He is buried next to his wife Lorene, who died in 2000, at the New Park Cemetery in Memphis.

Writer Peter Guralnick said of him:His music... brought a great deal of joy to the world, but his personality brought even more, conveying a message of grit, determination, indomitability, above all a bottomless appreciation for the human comedy that left little room for the drab or the dreary in his presence.

Thomas was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Byhalia.

<text>Marion Walter Jacobs (May 1, 1930 – February 15, 1968), known as Little Walter, was an American blues musician, singer, and songwriter, whose revolutionary approach to the harmonica had a strong impact on succeeding generations, earning him comparisons to such seminal artists as Django Reinhardt, Charlie Parker and Jimi Hendrix. His virtuosity and musical innovations fundamentally altered many listeners&#x27; expectations of what was possible on blues harmonica. He was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, the first and, to date, only artist to be inducted specifically as a harmonica player.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Jacobs&#x27; date of birth is usually given as May 1, 1930, in Marksville, Louisiana. He was born without a birth certificate and when he applied for a Social Security card in 1940, his birthdate was listed as May 1, 1923. Over the years he often gave different years, but May 1 was constant. In some other documents he filled out before reaching the age of the majority, he indicated birth years of 1925 and 1928, probably to appear to be of legal age to sign contracts for recordings and club work. After reaching the age of majority based on a birth year of 1930, he consistently gave his birth year as 1930. In the 1940 U.S. Census, his mother Beatrice reported his age at 14, making his birth year 1925.

He was raised in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, where he learned to play the harmonica. He quit school, and by the age of 12 had left rural Louisiana and travelled, working odd jobs and busking on the streets of New Orleans, Memphis, Helena and West Helena, Arkansas, and St. Louis. He honed his musical skills on harmonica and guitar, performing with older bluesmen including Sonny Boy Williamson II, Sunnyland Slim, Honeyboy Edwards, and others.

Arriving in Chicago in 1946, he occasionally found work as a guitarist but garnered more attention for his already highly developed harmonica playing. According to Chicago bluesman Floyd Jones, Little Walter&#x27;s first recording was an unreleased demo recorded soon after he arrived in Chicago, on which Walter played guitar backing Jones. Jacobs, reportedly frustrated with having his harmonica drowned out by electric guitars, adopted a simple but previously little-used method: He cupped a small microphone in his hands along with his harmonica and plugged the microphone into a public address system or guitar amplifier. He could thus compete with any guitarist&#x27;s volume. However, unlike other contemporary blues harp players, such as Sonny Boy Williamson I and Snooky Pryor, who had also started using the newly available amplifier technology around the same time solely for added volume, Walter purposely pushed his amplifiers beyond their intended technical limitations, using the amplification to explore and develop radical new timbres and sonic effects previously unheard from a harmonica or any other instrument.

===Success===
Jacobs made his first released recordings in 1947 for Bernard Abrams&#x27; tiny Ora-Nelle label, which operated out of the back room of Abrams&#x27; Maxwell Radio and Records store in the heart of the Maxwell Street district in Chicago. These and several other of his early recordings, like many blues harp recordings of the era, owed a strong stylistic debt to the pioneering blues harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson I (John Lee Williamson). Walter joined Muddy Waters&#x27; band in 1948, and by 1950 he was playing acoustic (unamplified) harmonica on Waters&#x27;s recordings for Chess Records. The first appearance on record of Little Walter&#x27;s amplified harmonica was on Waters&#x27; &quot;Country Boy&quot; (Chess 1952), recorded on July 11, 1951. For years after his departure from Waters&#x27; band in 1952, Chess continued to hire him to play on Waters&#x27; recording sessions, and as a result his harmonica is featured on most of Waters&#x27; classic recordings of the 1950s. As a guitarist, Little Walter recorded three songs for the small Parkway label with Waters and Baby Face Leroy Foster (reissued on CD by Delmark Records as &quot;The Blues World of Little Walter&quot; in 1993) and on a session for Chess backing pianist Eddie Ware. His guitar playing was also occasionally featured on early Chess sessions with Waters and Jimmy Rogers. In January 1952, talent scout Ike Turner tried to get Jacobs to record for Modern Records while in Helena, but Jacobs was on his way to Mississippi. They played together in Clarksdale.

Jacobs had put his career as a bandleader on hold when he joined Waters&#x27; band, but he stepped out front again when he recorded under his own name for Chess&#x27; subsidiary label Checker Records on May 12, 1952. The first completed take of the first song attempted at his debut session became his first number one hit, spending eight weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The song was &quot;Juke&quot;, and it is still the only harmonica instrumental ever to be a number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The original title of the track file was &quot;Your Cat Will Play&quot;, but was renamed at Leonard Chess&#x27; suggestion. (Three of his other harmonica instrumentals also made the Billboard R&amp;B top 10 while &quot;Juke&quot; was still on the charts.: &quot;Off the Wall&quot; reached number eight, &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; reached number six, and &quot;Sad Hours&quot; reached number two.) &quot;Juke&quot; was the biggest hit to date for any artist on Chess and its affiliated labels and one of the biggest national R&amp;B hits of 1952 securing Walter&#x27;s position on the Chess artist roster for the next decade.

Walter had fourteen top ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts between 1952 and 1958, including two number one hits (the second being &quot;My Babe&quot; in 1955), a level of commercial success never achieved by Waters or by his fellow Chess blues artists Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Sonny Boy Williamson II. Following the pattern of &quot;Juke&quot;, most of Little Walter&#x27;s singles released in the 1950s featured a vocal performance on one side and a harmonica instrumental on the other. Walter or Chess A&amp;R man Willie Dixon wrote many of his vocal numbers or they adapted them from earlier blues themes. In general, his sound was more modern and up tempo than the popular Chicago blues of the day. He based it on Louis Jordan&#x27;s saxophone playing which was jazzier and swinging and rhythmically less rigid than that of other, contemporary blues harmonica players. 

Jacobs left Waters&#x27; band in 1952 and recruited his own backing band, the Aces, a group that was already working steadily in Chicago backing Junior Wells. The Aces, the brothers David and Louis Myers on guitars and Fred Below on drums, were credited as the Jukes on most of the Little Walter records on which they played. By 1955, the members of the Aces had each separately left Walter to pursue other opportunities and were initially replaced by the guitarists Robert &quot;Junior&quot; Lockwood and Luther Tucker and drummer Odie Payne. Among others who worked in Little Walter&#x27;s recording and touring bands in the 1950s were the guitarists Jimmie Lee Robinson and Freddie Robinson, and drummer George Hunter. Little Walter also occasionally included saxophone players in his touring bands during this period, among them the young Albert Ayler, and Ray Charles on one early tour. By the late 1950s, Little Walter no longer employed a regular full-time band, instead hiring various players as needed from the large pool of blues musicians in Chicago.

Jacobs often played the harmonica on records by others in the Chess stable of artists, including Jimmy Rogers, John Brim, Rocky Fuller, Memphis Minnie, the Coronets, Johnny Shines, Floyd Jones, Bo Diddley, and Shel Silverstein. He also played on recordings for other labels, backing Otis Rush, Johnny &quot;Man&quot; Young, and Robert Nighthawk.

Jacobs suffered from alcoholism and had a notoriously short temper, which in the late 1950s led to violent altercations, minor scrapes with the law, and increasingly irresponsible behavior. This led to a decline in his fame and fortunes, beginning in the late 1950s. Nonetheless, he toured Europe twice, in 1964 and 1967, (the long-circulated story that he toured the United Kingdom with the Rolling Stones in 1964 has been refuted by Keith Richards). The 1967 European tour, as part of the American Folk Blues Festival, resulted in the only known film footage of Little Walter performing. Footage of him backing Hound Dog Taylor and Koko Taylor was shown on a television program in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 11, 1967, and was released on DVD in 2004. Further video of another recently discovered television appearance in Germany during this same tour, showing Jacobs performing his songs &quot;My Babe,&quot; &quot;Mean Old World,&quot; and others, was released on DVD in Europe in January 2009; it is the only known footage of him singing. Other television appearances in the UK (in 1964) and the Netherlands (in 1967) have been documented, but no footage of these has yet been uncovered. Jacobs recorded and toured infrequently in the 1960s, playing mainly in and around Chicago.

===Death===
A few months after returning from his second European tour, Little Walter was involved in a fight while taking a break from a performance at a nightclub on the South Side of Chicago. He apparently sustained only minor injuries in this altercation, but they aggravated the damage he had suffered in previous violent encounters, and he died in his sleep at the apartment of a girlfriend, at 209 East 54th Street in Chicago, early the following morning. The official cause of death on his death certificate was coronary thrombosis (a blood clot in the heart). Evidence of external injuries was so insignificant that the police reported that his death was due to &quot;unknown or natural causes&quot;, and no external injuries were noted on the death certificate. His body was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery, in Evergreen Park, Illinois, on February 22, 1968.

==Legacy==
The music journalist Bill Dahl described Little Walter as &quot;king of all post-war blues harpists&quot;, who &quot;took the humble mouth organ in dazzling amplified directions that were unimaginable prior to his ascendancy.&quot; His legacy has been enormous. He is widely credited by blues historians as the artist primarily responsible for establishing the standard vocabulary for modern blues and blues rock harmonica players. Biographer Tony Glover notes Little Walter directly influenced Junior Wells, James Cotton, George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith, and Carey Bell. He includes Jerry Portnoy, Mark Hummel, Rick Estrin of Little Charlie &amp; the Nightcats, Kim Wilson, Paul Butterfield, Brian Jones and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones, Rod Piazza, Lester Butler of Red Devils fame, and William Clarke among those who later studied his technique and helped popularize it with younger players.

Little Walter&#x27;s daughter, Marion Diaz Reacco, established the Little Walter Foundation in Chicago, to &quot;carry on the legacy and genius of her father&#x27;s music&quot;. The foundation aims to create programs for the creative arts, including music, animation and video.

<text>Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov (; 14 September 1891 – 20 March 1983) was a Soviet mathematician, who was one of the creators of modern analytic number theory, and also a dominant figure in mathematics in the USSR. He was born in the Velikiye Luki district, Pskov Oblast. He graduated from the University of St. Petersburg, where in 1920 he became a Professor. From 1934 he was a Director of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, a position he held for the rest of his life, except for the five-year period (1941–1946) when the institute was directed by Academician Sergei Sobolev. In 1941 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1951 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Kraków.

==Mathematical contributions==

In analytic number theory, &quot;Vinogradov&#x27;s method&quot; refers to his main problem-solving technique, applied to central questions involving the estimation of exponential sums. In its most basic form, it is used to estimate sums over prime numbers, or Weyl sums. It is a reduction from a complicated sum to a number of smaller sums which are then simplified. The canonical form for prime number sums is

:formula_1

With the help of this method, Vinogradov tackled questions such as the ternary Goldbach problem in 1937 (using Vinogradov&#x27;s theorem), and the zero-free region for the Riemann zeta function. His own use of it was inimitable; in terms of later techniques, it is recognised as a prototype of the large sieve method in its application of bilinear forms, and also as an exploitation of combinatorial structure. In some cases his results resisted improvement for decades.

He also used this technique on the Dirichlet divisor problem, allowing him to estimate the number of integer points under an arbitrary curve. This was an improvement on the work of Georgy Voronoy.

In 1918 Vinogradov proved the Pólya–Vinogradov inequality for character sums.

== Personality and career ==

Vinogradov served as director of the Mathematical Institute for 49 years. For his long service he was twice awarded the order of The Hero of the Socialist Labour. The house where he was born was converted into his memorial – a unique honour among Russian mathematicians. As the head of a leading mathematical institute, Vinogradov enjoyed significant influence in the Academy of Sciences and was regarded as an informal leader of Soviet mathematicians, not always in a positive way: his anti-Semitic feelings led him to hinder the careers of many prominent Soviet mathematicians.

Although he was always faithful to the official line, he was never a member of the Communist Party and his overall mindset was nationalistic rather than communist. This can at least partly be attributed to his origins: his father was a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church. Vinogradov was enormously strong: in some recollections it is stated that he could lift a chair with a person sitting on it by holding the leg of the chair in his hands. He was never married and was very attached to his dacha in Abramtsevo, where he spent all his weekends and vacations (together with his sister Nadezhda, also unmarried) enjoying flower gardening. He had friendly relations with the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh and Mikhail Lavrentyev, both mathematicians whose careers started in his institute.

<doc id="467113" wikidata="Q1059968" url="?curid=467113" title="Violet-green swallow">
<text>The violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina) is a small North American passerine bird in the swallow family. These aerial insectivores are distributed along the west coast from Alaska to Mexico, extending as far east as Montana and Texas. With an appearance very similar to the tree swallow, these individuals can be identified by the white rump side-patches that appear to separate their green back and purple tail. Violet-green swallows are secondary cavity nesters, found in a number of habitats including deciduous and coniferous forest. In addition to nesting in tree holes within these habitats, they are also widely observed nesting in the cracks of large cliffs.

==Description==

The distinct body form of swallows distinguishes them from other passerine birds. Their long pointed wings and slim, streamlined body evolved to catch insects while in flight. The body of the violet-green swallow is no exception. With an average body length of 5¼ in. (13 cm), the violet-green swallow is slightly shorter and appears more compact in flight compared to other members of the family Hirundinidae. The violet-green swallow most closely resembles the North American tree swallow, but can be distinguished by its shorter wings and colouration.

===Colouration===
The violet-green swallow gets its name from the colouration on its back and rump. The species is best identified by the glossy green on the top of the head and back as well as hints of purple on the nape, rump and upper tail. Below the green back, the remainder of the wing is a grayish-bronze. Similar to other swallows, &quot;T. thalassina&quot; is white below, but differs in that the white continues onto rump side-patches that almost meet at the base of the tail. These white rump side-patches sometimes look like one continuous stripe when in flight. White also extends onto the cheeks, partially surrounding the eye. The notch in the tail of the violet-green swallow is slightly shallower than that of the tree swallow, but deeper than the relatively flat tail of the cliff swallow.

Violet-green swallows exhibit very little sexual dimorphism, with adult males simply showing brighter colours than adult females. Additionally, the white cheeks are not as prominent and the head is more bronze than green on the female. Juveniles are not as easily identifiable compared to adults due to their dull colouration. Similar to other juvenile swallows, especially the tree swallow, the juvenile violet-green swallow is white below and grayish-brown above. However, the more gradual change in colour and visible (but slightly reduced) white cheek patches can help identify juvenile individuals of the species.

===Standard measurements===
==Taxonomy==
The swallows have been well studied ecologically, but only recently has their phylogeny been thoroughly researched. Swallows are passerine birds grouped within the family Hirundinidae. The family Hirundinidae is split into two subfamilies: Pseudochelidoninae, which contains two species of river martins, and Hirundininae, comprising all other martins and swallows. The 82 species within the subfamily &quot;Hirundininae&quot; are further classified into three groupings: the mud nesters, basal relicts and core martins, with the violet-green swallow falling into the last group. Violet-green swallows are one of 9 species of New World tree swallows within the genus &quot;Tachycineta&quot;. This genus is a monophyletic group and is considered the sister taxa of all other New World swallows.
Violet-green swallows are important members of the &quot;Tachycineta&quot; clade due to their large geographic range and because they are one of 2 species that breed within North America. It is generally agreed that &quot;Tachycineta&quot; is split into a North and a South American clade, but the phylogenetic placement within the genus depends on the type of analysis used. The violet-green swallow is a member of the North American grouping, along with &quot;T. bicolor&quot; (the North American tree swallow), &quot;T. euchrysea&quot; (the golden swallow of Hispaniola and Jamaica) and &quot;T. cyaneoviridis&quot; (the Bahama swallow). A mitochondrial genome analysis has placed &quot;T. thalassina&quot; as a sister taxon of the Caribbean swallows, &quot;T. euchrysea&quot; and &quot;T. cyaneoviridis&quot;, with all 3 species forming a sister clade to &quot;T. bicolor&quot;. Nuclear genome analyses and a consensus of both methods have reorganized this North American clade, alternating the closest sister taxon of &quot;T. thalassina&quot; between &quot;T. cyaneoviridis&quot; and &quot;T. euchrysea&quot;. Nonetheless, the taxonomy of the violet-green swallow is well understood up to the genus level, after which some uncertainty surrounds the placement of &quot;T. thalassina&quot; within the North American clade of the genus &quot;Tachycineta&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Violet-green swallows are divided into three subspecies, T. t. thalassina, T. t. brachyptera and T. t. lepida differing in breeding ranges and wing length. &quot;T. t. thalassina&quot; has slightly longer wings and has been known to breed as far north as Alaska, while the shorter winged &quot;T. t. brachyptera&quot; breeds further south in California and Mexico. Not all of the literature agrees upon &quot;T. t. lepida&quot; as a third subspecies, and little information is available to help distinguish it from other subspecies.

===Hybridization===
Hybridization has been known to occur among the swallows, with a few cases involving violet-green swallows being reported. Breeding between violet-green swallows and both tree and barn swallows has been recorded on separate occasions, but resulting offspring were not observed. In 2000, the strange plumage of a swallow seen in British Columbia, Canada, suggested the possible successful hybridization of a violet-green and a cliff swallow. Nonetheless, these observations are rare, which accounts for the minimal research into swallow hybridization.

==Habitat==
The type of habitat occupied by violet-green swallows varies depending on their geographical location and elevation. Across their range, these birds can be found in deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, as well as within canyons and in close proximity to large cliffs. Breeding and non-breeding habitats do not differ much except that breeding habitat is usually at lower elevations. Violet-green swallows have also been observed nesting around buildings in more settled areas.

==Distribution==
Violet-green swallows are a predominantly western species, with the rare sighting of individuals in eastern North America. The distribution of the species can be divided on the basis of the recognized subspecies, but the entire range spans from central Alaska down to Mexico. Longitudinally, the range borders the west coast of Alaska, British Columbia and the United States, and extends eastward into southwestern Alberta, Montana, the Dakotas and Texas. The breeding range spans almost the entire distribution, while the winter range is restricted to Mexico.

==Behaviour==

===Vocalizations===
There are many knowledge gaps surrounding the vocalization behaviour of violet-green swallows. These gaps include vocalizations made during early development, alarm calls and the daily pattern of calls. The little information available suggests two main classes of vocalizations, the &quot;chee-chee&quot; calls and &quot;twitter&quot; calls.

This call is most commonly heard when one violet-green swallow interacts with another swallow, either during foraging, in-flight chases or when approaching a nesting site. Flocks of swallows have been recorded making &quot;chee-chee&quot; calls, suggesting its use in social cohesion. Juveniles have also been observed making this vocalization when waiting to be fed by an adult, implying that it plays a role in parent-juvenile recognition.

==== &quot;Twitter&quot; calls ====
Observations of violet-green swallows making &quot;twitter&quot; calls typically associate the vocalization with courtship displays and the establishment of new territories. Twitter calls have only been heard in flight, either by a male escorting a female or during brief intraspecific territorial disputes. Mixing of the two calls occurs occasionally, but little ecological research can explain its use.

=== Diet ===
Similar to other swallows, violet-green swallows are specialized aerial insectivores, catching and eating their prey while in flight. However, they have been known to feed higher in the sky than most other swallows. The examination of the stomach contents of multiple individuals has presented a wide range of diet items, including insects like ants, beetles and flies as well as other arthropods such as spiders. On rare occurrences these birds have been observed foraging along the ground, but such events represent exceptions to their typical feeding habits.

===Reproduction===
Violet-green swallows will usually arrive at their breeding area weeks prior to the start of reproduction. Location dependent, copulation takes place mid-May with the eggs being laid by the start of June, followed by a couple weeks of incubation before hatching. The average clutch size is 5 eggs, with females laying approximately 1 per day. During the weeks post-hatching, the parents feed their young as they slowly begin to grow their feathers. After approximately 3 weeks the young are ready to leave the nest. It is more common for pairs to reproduce once per breeding season, but a second brooding has been observed on occasion.

====Nesting sites====
Violet-green swallows are secondary cavity nesters, meaning they typically nest in natural holes or previously occupied nests. Some breeding pairs will even go as far as usurping nests from other species. A majority of violet-green swallow nests are in tree holes excavated by other animals or within the cracks of large cliffs. Due to their dependence on large trees, violet-green swallows are highly impacted by forest management practices. In addition to nesting in natural cavities, violet-green swallows have also been observed occupying artificial nest boxes. Pairs typically breed in independent nests, except on cliffs where large colonies can be found nesting together.

====Interspecific egg-dumping====
Violet-green swallows have been observed cooperating and competing with various avian species, including western bluebirds. A similar field observation notes a violet-green swallow laying an egg in an active bluebird nest box. Initially, the male bluebird attempted to drive the swallow from the nest cavity, while the female bluebird did not seem concerned with the intruder. It appeared the bluebirds tolerated the act of egg-dumping by the violet-green swallow, but the observer returned the following day to find the newly laid egg smashed below the nest. This behaviour suggests that when unable to access her original nest after physiologically committing to laying her egg, a female violet-green swallow may participate in interspecific egg-dumping.

====Intraspecific paternity-defence====
Violet-green swallows are secondary cavity nesters and aerial insectivores, making males susceptible to nest and mate competition. To avoid being cuckolded, males spend more time guarding their mate than their nest, contrary to tree swallows. This paternity-defence behaviour emphasizes that non-territorial violet-green swallows exhibit greater mate competition than nesting site competition.

===Interspecific cooperation===
Multiple accounts of violet-green swallows forming cooperative relationships with other species have been recorded. From 1981 to 1982, three independent swallow pairs were observed co-occupying the nest boxes of western bluebirds. These violet-green swallows protected the nesting site, removed fecal sacs from the boxes and fed the bluebird fledglings with no resistance from the adult western bluebirds. Despite too small of a sample size to hold statistical significance, fledgling survival was greater when violet-green swallows provided active care. It is believed that the swallows benefit from the cooperative relationship by inheriting the nest box after the bluebird parents and fledglings have left.

===Interspecific competition===

Similar to the occasional observation of violet-green swallows building interspecific cooperative relationships, they have also been involved in interspecific competition for nesting sites. One example from 1974 noted the competitive behaviour between mountain chickadees and violet-green swallows. The physical altercation began when a pair of swallows attempted to overtake a nesting site occupied by a pair of chickadees and their fledglings. After multiple aerial battles, the chickadees regained control of their nest and successfully defended against future violet-green swallow attacks. The same field observer noted a similar altercation between violet-green swallows and hairy woodpeckers, which resulted in the same outcome. These species are permanent residents, allowing them first choice of nesting sites, while the violet-green swallows are summer residents with late breeding habits. Thus, a scarcity of viable nesting sites may lead to this interspecific competitive behaviour in violet-green swallows. A similar observation of competitive behaviour for potential nesting sites has been observed between acorn woodpeckers and violet-green swallows.

===Torpor===
It has been speculated that certain birds, including swallows, enter a state of torpidity during harsh winter conditions. Few observations of this decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate have been recorded in violet-green swallows, the first case occurring in 1965 near Death Valley National Monument in Saratoga Springs, California. Field observers noted 3 &quot;dead&quot; individuals on the east-facing slope of a dune the morning after a cold and windy night. Upon closer observation, the violet-green swallows made minor movements, such as opening their eyes, but did not struggle while being handled. The physical appearance of the swallows, including the position of their head in relation to the slope and the fluffing of their feathers was similar to that of other birds in torpor. Despite the lack of thermometers, it was apparent these 3 individuals were in a state of hypothermia for about 45 minutes after the sun began to rise. Eventually the 3 swallows awkwardly flew off, signifying the end of their torpor bout.

===Ectoparasite control===

====Sunbathing====
In addition to reaching borderline hypothermic temperatures during bouts of torpor, violet-green swallows have been observed behaving similar to hyperthermic individuals while sunbathing. Indications of this activity include the orientation of their wings and tail, their trance-like state and the occasional loss of balance. Research has shown that increasing feather temperatures during basking can control ectoparasites. The period of sunbathing in violet-green swallows is short and dependent on ambient temperature and wind velocity, but typically occurs after an increase in parasite loads near the end of nesting.

<text>Swag is a crime novel by Elmore Leonard, first published in 1976 and since also released as an audio recording. The first paperback edition was published under the alternative title of Ryan&#x27;s Rules.

Ernest Stickley, Jr. reappears in &quot;Stick&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Frank Ryan is an almost honest used car salesman, who after deliberately not testifying against car thief Ernest &quot;Stick&quot; Stickley, Jr., thinks of a foolproof plan for them to perform armed robberies.
The plan is about simple everyday armed robbery. Supermarkets, bars, liquor stores, gas stations, etc. Because the statistics prove that this armed robbery pays the most for the least amount of risk, they start their business and earn three to five thousand dollars a week.
To prevent getting caught Frank introduces 10 golden rules for successful armed robbery:

# Always be polite on the job and say please and thank you.
# Never say more than necessary. Less is more.
# Never call your partner by name-unless you use a made-up name.
# Never look suspicious or like a bum and dress well.
# Never use your own car.
# Never count the take in the car.
# Never flash money in a bar or with women.
# Never go back to an old bar or hangout once you have moved up.
# Never tell anyone your business and never tell a junkie even your name.
# Never associate with people known to be in crime.

For a while, Frank and Stick are able to follow the rules and the plan and they are extremely successful. They even rob the robber who just robbed the bar they were in. But, inevitably, the rules start falling by the wayside and when they see a chance for a big score, the rules go out the window, with predictably disastrous results.

<text>Robert Vaughn Young (April 23, 1938 – June 15, 2003) commonly known by his initials RVY, was an American whistleblower against the Church of Scientology after working high inside their organization for over twenty years.

== In Scientology ==

Young had been a national spokesman for the Church of Scientology. Of his years with the organization, Young said:
Young edited L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s ten-volume &quot;Mission Earth&quot; series. Young said that Hubbard had written the main text of the series, but that he had ghostwritten the introduction of each volume, as well as other writings in Hubbard&#x27;s name.

In 1989, Young was removed from his job as head of worldwide public relations for the Church of Scientology and sent to the RPF — Rehabilitation Project Force — Scientology&#x27;s manual labor re-education camp.

== After leaving ==

After leaving the Church of Scientology in 1989, Young became prominent as an expert in court cases regarding Scientology such as &quot;CSI v. Fishman and Geertz&quot;, &quot;BPI v. FACTNet&quot;, the Lisa McPherson civil trial, cited by the press, and as an Internet-based critic of the organization.

David Miscavige had sent Mike Rinder and Mike Sutter to Seattle to try to silence Vaughn Young and his then-wife Stacey by &quot;making peace&quot; with them. They had almost clinched a deal when Miscavige ordered them to change the terms. That derailed the negotiations and the couple continued to be a thorn in Scientology&#x27;s side for many years. Other harassments by the Church came to the attention of Bob Minton, a wealthy financier who was interested in free speech on the internet. He took up the couple&#x27;s cause and paid to relocate them to a house outside of Seattle. Through his contact with the Youngs, Minton learned more about Scientology and eventually founded the Lisa McPherson Trust with Stacey.

Young was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 23, 1999, and turned his energies to Phoenix5, a non-profit organization that runs a website on the disease. He died on June 15, 2003.

<doc id="467119" wikidata="Q347412" url="?curid=467119" title="Edogawa Ranpo">
<text>, better known by the pen name , was a Japanese author and critic who played a major role in the development of Japanese mystery and thriller fiction. Many of his novels involve the detective hero Kogoro Akechi, who in later books was the leader of a group of boy detectives known as the .

Ranpo was an admirer of Western mystery writers, and especially of Edgar Allan Poe. His pen name is a rendering of Poe&#x27;s name. Other authors who were special influences on him were Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whom he attempted to translate into Japanese during his days as a student at Waseda University, and the Japanese mystery writer Ruikō Kuroiwa.

==Biography==

===Before World War II===
Tarō Hirai was born in Nabari, Mie Prefecture in 1894, where his grandfather had been a samurai in the service of Tsu Domain. His father was a merchant, who had also practiced law. The family moved to what is now Kameyama, Mie, and from there to Nagoya when he was age two. At the age of 17, he studied economics at Waseda University in Tokyo starting in 1912. After graduating in 1916 with a degree in economics, he worked a series of odd jobs, including newspaper editing, drawing cartoons for magazine publications, selling soba noodles as a street vendor, and working in a used bookstore.

In 1923, he made his literary debut by publishing the mystery story under the pen name &quot;Edogawa Ranpo&quot; (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like the name of the American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine &quot;&quot;, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. &quot;Shin Seinen&quot; had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, but this was the first time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo&#x27;s first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer, but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruikō Kuroiwa, Kidō Okamoto, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Haruo Satō, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque. What struck critics as new about Ranpo&#x27;s debut story &quot;The Two-Sen Copper Coin&quot; was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within a story that is closely related to Japanese culture. The story involves an extensive description of an ingenious code based on a Buddhist chant known as the &quot;nenbutsu&quot; as well as Japanese-language Braille.

Over the course of the next several years, Edogawa went on to write a number of other stories that focus on crimes and the processes involved in solving them. Among these stories are a number of stories that are now considered classics of early 20th-century Japanese popular literature: , which is about a woman who is killed in the course of a sadomasochistic extramarital affair, , which is about a man who kills a neighbor in a Tokyo boarding house by dropping poison through a hole in the attic floor into his mouth, and , which is about a man who hides himself in a chair to feel the bodies on top of him. Mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices appear in many of Edogawa&#x27;s other early stories, such as &quot;The Hell of Mirrors&quot;.

Although many of his first stories were primarily about sleuthing and the processes used in solving seemingly insolvable crimes, during the 1930s, he began to turn increasingly to stories that involved a combination of sensibilities often called &quot;ero guro nansensu&quot;, from the three words &quot;eroticism, grotesquerie, and the nonsensical&quot;. The presence of these sensibilities helped him sell his stories to the public, which was increasingly eager to read his work. One finds in these stories a frequent tendency to incorporate elements of what the Japanese at that time called . For instance, a major portion of the plot of the novel , serialized from January 1929 to February 1930 in the journal , involves a homosexual doctor and his infatuation for another main character.

By the 1930s, Edogawa was writing regularly for a number of major public journals of popular literature, and he had emerged as the foremost voice of Japanese mystery fiction. The detective hero Kogorō Akechi, who had first appeared in the story &quot;The Case of the Murder on D. Hill&quot; became a regular feature in his stories, a number of which pitted him against a dastardly criminal known as the , who had an incredible ability to disguise himself and move throughout society. (A number of these novels were subsequently made into films.) The 1930 novel introduced the adolescent as Kogoro&#x27;s sidekick, and in the period after World War II, Edogawa wrote a number of novels for young readers that involved Kogoro and Kobayashi as the leaders of a group of young sleuths called the . These works were wildly popular and are still read by many young Japanese readers, much like the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries are popular mysteries for adolescents in the English-speaking world.

===During World War II===

In 1939, two years after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Edogawa was ordered by government censors to drop his story , which he had published without incident a few years before, from a collection of his short stories that the publisher &quot;Shun&#x27;yōdō&quot; was reprinting. &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; is about a veteran who was turned into a quadriplegic and so disfigured by war that he was little more than a human &quot;caterpillar&quot;, unable to talk, move, or live by himself. Censors banned the story, apparently believing that the story would detract from the current war effort. This came as a blow to Ranpo, who relied on royalties from reprints for income. (The short story inspired director Kōji Wakamatsu, who drew from it his movie &quot;Caterpillar&quot;, which competed for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.)

Over the course of World War II, especially during the full-fledged war between Japan and the US that began in 1941, Edogawa was active in his local neighborhood organization, and he wrote a number of stories about young detectives and sleuths that might be seen as in line with the war effort, but he wrote most of these under different pseudonyms as if to disassociate them with his legacy. In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, to Fukushima in northern Japan. Edogawa remained until June, when he was suffering from malnutrition. Much of Ikebukuro was destroyed in Allied air raids and the subsequent fires that broke out in the city, but the thick, earthen-walled warehouse which he used as his studio was spared, and still stands to this day beside the campus of Rikkyo University.

===Postwar===
In the postwar period, Edogawa dedicated a great deal of energy to promoting mystery fiction, both in terms of the understanding of its history and encouraging the production of new mystery fiction. In 1946, he put his support behind a new journal called dedicated to mystery fiction and, in 1947, he founded the which changed its name in 1963 to the . In addition, he wrote a large number of articles about the history of Japanese, European, and American mystery fiction. Many of these essays were published in book form. Other than essays, much of his postwar literary production consisted largely of novels for juvenile readers featuring Kogorō Akechi and the Boy Detectives Club.

In the 1950s, he and a bilingual translator collaborated for five years on a translation of Edogawa&#x27;s works into English, published as &quot;Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; by Tuttle. Since the translator could speak but not read Japanese and Edogawa could read but not write English, the translation was done aurally, with Edogawa reading each sentence aloud, then checking the written English.

Another of his interests, especially during the late 1940s and 1950s, was bringing attention to the work of his dear friend Jun&#x27;ichi Iwata (1900–1945), an anthropologist who had spent many years researching the history of homosexuality in Japan. During the 1930s, Edogawa and Iwata had engaged in a lighthearted competition to see who could find the most books about erotic desire between men. Edogawa dedicated himself to finding books published in the West and Iwata dedicated himself to finding books having to do with Japan. Iwata died in 1945 with only part of his work published, so Edogawa worked to have the remaining work on gay historiography published.

In the postwar period, a large number of Edogawa&#x27;s books were made into films. The interest in using Edogawa&#x27;s literature as a departure point for creating films has continued well after his death. Edogawa, who had a variety of health issues, including atherosclerosis and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, died from a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in 1965. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, near Tokyo.

The , named after him, is a Japanese literary award which has been presented every year by the Mystery Writers of Japan since 1955. The winner is given a prize of ¥10 million with publication rights by Kodansha.

==In popular culture==

*Director Teruo Ishii&#x27;s &quot;Horrors of Malformed Men&quot; from 1969 incorporates plot elements from a number of Ranpo stories. Noboru Tanaka filmed &quot;Watcher in the Attic&quot; as part of Nikkatsu&#x27;s &quot;Roman porno&quot; series in 1976.
*The manga group CLAMP used Edogawa as one of the inspirations for the series &quot;Man of Many Faces&quot; (1990–1991).
*Akio Jissoji&#x27;s films &quot;Watcher in the Attic&quot; (1992) and &quot;Murder on D Street&quot; (1998) are both adaptations of Ranpo&#x27;s works. In both these movies Kogorō Akechi is played by actor Kyūsaku Shimada.
*In 1994, a film entitled &quot;Rampo&quot; inspired by Ranpo&#x27;s works was released in Japan (The film was retitled &quot;The Mystery of Rampo&quot; for its American release). Ranpo himself is the lead character of the film and is portrayed by actor Naoto Takenaka.
*The 1999 film &quot;Gemini&quot; by Shinya Tsukamoto is based on an Edogawa Ranpo story.
*Some of Ranpo&#x27;s stories were later turned into short films in the 2005 compilation &quot;Rampo Noir,&quot; starring the well-known actor Tadanobu Asano.
*Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;&quot; is an adaptation of Ranpo&#x27;s 1928 short story.
*The horror manga artist Suehiro Maruo has adapted two of Ranpo&#x27;s stories: &quot;The Strange Tale of the Panorama Island&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; (2009).
*In 2009 the Japanese Google homepage displayed a logo commemorating his birthday on October 21.
*The manga and anime series &quot;Detective Conan&quot; (Meitantei Conan) has the main character&#x27;s alias as &#x27;Edogawa Conan&#x27;, created from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Ranpo&#x27;s names. The detective that he lives with is called Mouri Kogoro, and Conan is part of a children&#x27;s detective group called the Detective Boys (Shonen Tantei Dan); all apparent homages to the late Ranpo.
*The video game &quot;Persona 5&quot; has a detective character named Goro Akechi, which is a reference to Ranpo&#x27;s character Akechi Kogoro.
*The anime and manga &quot;Bungo Stray Dogs&quot; with characters inspired off popular Japanese authors, has a character named Edogawa Ranpo, who is incredibly talented detective who solve crimes the police have trouble with along with other mysteries. He has an ability called &quot;Ultra Deduction&quot;, which allows him to deduce correct answers based on given information. He is also shown to have a close connection with Edgar Allen Poe.
*The last two episodes (10 and 11) of the 2013 Fuji Television (フジテレビ) series, &quot;Biblia Koshodō no Jiken Techō&quot; (ビブリア古書堂の事件手帖 Antiquarian Bookseller Biblia&#x27;s Case Files), are constructed around two Edogawa Ranpo works, &quot;Boys Detective Club&quot; and &quot;The Man Traveling with the Brocade Portrait&quot; (translated as &quot;The Traveler with the Pasted Rag Picture&quot;).
*The online game &quot;Bungou to Alchemist&quot; featured Ranpo as one of the writers the player can get. In the game, he is portrayed as an eccentric man who hates mainstream things and enjoys creating new tricks, non-malicious pranks, and ways to defeat the enemy.
*The 2015 anime &quot;Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace&quot; was inspired by the works of Edogawa and commemorates the 50th anniversary of his death.
*The titles of the first 11 novels in Nisio Isin&#x27;s &quot;Bishōnen Series&quot; parodies the titles of Ranpo&#x27;s works. The 2021 anime adaptation incorporates this parody into its episode titles.
*The 2016 anime &quot;Trickster&quot; takes Ranpo&#x27;s characters and sets them in the 2030s. An unusual twist is that Kobayashi is not a boy detective, but instead a character with a supernatural power that keeps him from being killed or dying - but that also keeps him isolated and longing for death.
*The Japanese heavy metal band Ningen Isu is named after the short story of the same name.
*Several of his works have been adapted or expanded upon by manga artist Junji Ito, including &quot;The Human Chair&quot; and &quot;An Unearthly Love&quot;.
*The 2021 video game &quot;Lost Judgment&quot; features the character of Kyoko Amasawa, a teen girl detective and mystery enthusiast who names Edogawa as her favorite author. She also has a &#x27;detective dog&#x27; named Ranpo, after the author. In the game, Ranpo is an intelligent Shiba Inu who finds clues by smell.
*The Japanese Vocaloid producer teniwoha references Ranpo and attributes the line &quot;someday, even artificial flowers will bear fruit&quot;, otherwise translated as &quot;even artificial flowers can bear the sweetest of fruit&quot; to him in their song &quot;villain&quot;, which discusses transitioning and gender dysphoria.

<text>Beatboxing (also, and sometimes, called beat boxing) is a form of vocal percussion primarily involving the art of mimicking drum machines (usually a TR-808), using one&#x27;s mouth, lips, tongue, and voice. It may also involve vocal imitation of turntablism, and other musical instruments. Beatboxing today is connected with hip-hop culture, often referred to as &quot;the fifth element&quot; of hip-hop, although it is not limited to hip-hop music. The term &quot;beatboxing&quot; is sometimes used to refer to vocal percussion in general.

== Origins ==
Techniques similar to beatboxing have been employed in diverse American musical genres since the 19th century, such as early rural music, both black and white, religious songs, blues, ragtime, vaudeville, and hokum. Examples include the Appalachian technique of eefing and the blues song &quot;Bye bye bird&quot; by Sonny Boy Williamson II.

Additional influences may perhaps include forms of African traditional music, in which performers utilize their bodies (e.g., by clapping or stomping) as percussion instruments and produce sounds with their mouths by breathing loudly in and out, a technique used in beatboxing today.

Many well-known performers used vocal percussion occasionally, even though this was not directly connected to the cultural tradition that came to be known as beatboxing. Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;That Would Be Something&quot; (1970) includes vocal percussion. Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; (1967) also includes vocal percussion performed by the group&#x27;s original lead vocalist, Syd Barrett. Jazz singers Bobby McFerrin and Al Jarreau were very well known for their vocal styles and techniques, which have had great impact on techniques beatboxers use today. Michael Jackson was known to record himself beatboxing on a dictation tape recorder as a demo and scratch recording to compose several of his songs, including &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, and others. In contrast, the English progressive rock band Jethro Tull adopted beatboxing on at least one track on their 2003 Christmas album. Gert Fröbe, a German actor most widely known for playing Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;beatboxes&quot; as Colonel Manfred von Holstein (simultaneously vocalizing horned and percussive instruments) in &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;, a 1965 British comedy film.

== Contribution to hip-hop == 
Modern beatboxing first began as a way to assist or backup the MC. When drum machines were unavailable or unaffordable, communities in the inner city of New York began to mimic the sounds with their voices in ciphers. The term &quot;beatboxing&quot; is derived from the mimicry of early drum machines, then known as beatboxes, particularly, and specifically, the Roland TR-808. The term &quot;beatbox&quot; was used to refer to earlier Roland drum machines such as the TR-55 and CR-78 in the 1970s. They were followed by the TR-808, released in 1980, which became central to hip hop music and electronic dance music. It is the TR-808 that human beatboxing is largely modeled after. 

&quot;Human beatboxing&quot; in hip-hop originated in the 1980s. Its early pioneers include Doug E. Fresh, the self-proclaimed first &quot;human beatbox&quot; (and arguably its most famous practitioner); Swifty, the first to implement the inhale sound technique; Buffy, who helped perfect many beatboxing techniques; and Wise, who contributed significantly to beat boxing&#x27;s proliferation. Wise inspired an entire new fan base of human beatboxers with his human turntable technique. Other pioneers of beatboxing include Rahzel well known for his realistic robotic sounds and for his ability to sing and beatbox simultaneously, Scratch a beatboxer and musician well known for further revolutionizing the use of vocal scratching in beatboxing, Kenny Muhammad the Human Orchestra, a beatboxer known for his technicality and outstanding rhythmic precision, who pioneered the inward k snare, a beatbox technique that imitates a snare drum by breathing inward, and Emanon, an early protegee of Doug E. Fresh associated with Ice T and Afrika Islam. Many refer to beatboxing as the unofficial 5th element of hip-hop.

== Modern beatboxing ==
The Internet has played a large part in the popularity of modern beatboxing. Alex Tew (aka A-Plus) started the first online community of beatboxers in 2000 under the banner of HUMANBEATBOX.COM. An early example of modern beatboxing was seen in the 2001 South Korean romantic comedy film &quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;. In 2001, Gavin Tyte, a member of this community created the world&#x27;s first tutorials and video tutorials on beatboxing. In 2003, the community held the world&#x27;s first Human Beatbox Convention in London featuring beatbox artists from all over the world.

Beatboxing&#x27;s current popularity is due in part to releases from artists such as Rahzel, RoxorLoops, Reeps One and Alem. In the Pacific, American beatboxer of Hawaii Chinese descent Jason Tom co-founded the Human Beatbox Academy to perpetuate the art of beatboxing through outreach performances, speaking engagements and workshops in Honolulu, the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city of the 50th U.S. state of Hawaii.

Sometimes, modern beatboxers will use their hand or another part of their body to extend the spectrum of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which is commonly known as the &quot;crab scratch&quot;. Another hand technique includes the &quot;throat tap&quot;, which involves beatboxers tapping their fingers against their throats as they throat sing or hum. Beatboxers today can produce up to two different sounds at the same time.

Modern beatboxing has also evolved with the advent of technology such as live looping. Many beatboxers like Beardyman, KRNFX, and The Petebox use modern looping devices such as the Boss RC-505 to sample or layer their beatboxing sounds live on stage, in addition to traditional solo beatboxing. Such adaptation has allowed modern beatboxers to perform entire musical compositions much like DJs but with their mouths.

Today there is an increase in the variety in which we see beatboxing throughout musical culture. People have gone as far as adding beatboxing in with different instruments to create a completely different sound unlike any other. Artist Greg Patillo goes as far as adding in beatboxing while playing the flute to very iconic songs. Beatbox has become modernized and has even been seen in popular movies such as &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot; and &quot;Pitch Perfect 2&quot;. These movies showcase classical songs performed with a cappella covers in which all of the beats to the songs are done completely using the idea and technique of beatboxing to complete the sound capable to imitate the original song.

==Notation==

As with other musical disciplines, some form of musical notation or transcription may sometimes be useful in order to describe beatbox patterns or performances. Sometimes this takes the form of ad hoc phonetic approximations, but is occasionally more formal. is usually the bass drum, is usually the snare drum, and () is usually the hi-hat (in : 𝄆b-ts-k-ts-b-ts-k-ts𝄇).

Standard Beatbox Notation (SBN) was created by Mark Splinter and Gavin Tyte of Humanbeatbox.com in 2006 as an alternative to International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription, which had been used sparingly before then.

In a research study published in 2013 and based on real-time MRI imaging of a beatboxer, the authors propose a notation system which combines the International Phonetic Alphabet with musical staff notation, in part motivated by their observation that many beatboxing sounds can be adequately represented by the IPA.

== Phonology ==
Each beatboxer can produce a very large number of unique sounds, but there are three distinct linguistic categories of sound within beatboxing. Ejectives are the strong puffs of air from the voice box that give intensity to percussive sounds. The &quot;t&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; sounds can all be made into ejectives. &quot;Ch&quot;, typically represented as [t͡ʃ], and &quot;j&quot;, usually [d͡ʒ], are some examples of (ejective) affricates.

Nonstandard fricatives are the mechanical sounds such as snare drums, cymbals, and other buzzing noises in beatboxing that are made with fricatives. Certain sounds, such as velar lateral fricatives, bilabial lateral fricatives, and linguolabial fricatives, and velar trills are all judged impossible according to the IPA but are technically possible and are sounds that are commonly used in beatboxing.

Coarticulation is the act of controlling a sound in two places at once. A common example of this is the sound created by rolling an &quot;r&quot; sound while saying a &quot;v&quot; sound. This is called a voiced alveolar trill with labiodental articulation. Similarly, epenthesis is the sound created when beatboxers sing and do percussion at the same time. Contrary to what the sound suggests, their tongue is not in two places at once. This effect is created by placing percussive sounds in the middle of words. 

==Multi-vocalism==
Multi-vocalism is a form of vocal musicianship conceptualized by British beatboxer and vocalist Killa Kela. It describes beatboxers who incorporate other vocal disciplines and practices into their routines and performances such as singing, rapping, sound mimicry and other vocal arts. Beardyman is a well known multi-vocalist.

==World records==
According to the Guinness World Records, the current record for the largest human beatbox ensemble was set by The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, with 6,430 participants, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 26 June 2017.

Prior to this, the record was set by Booking.com employees with 4,659 participants. It was achieved by Booking.com employees together with beatboxers at the RAI Amsterdam in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on 10 December 2013 during their annual company meeting.

The previous largest human beatbox ensemble involved 2,081 participants and was achieved by Google (Ireland), Shlomo (UK) and Testament (UK) at The Convention Centre, Dublin, Ireland, on 14 November 2011.

==In popular culture==
When asked to beatbox, Siri will repeat the phrase &quot;Boots and Cats&quot; to mimic beatboxing. &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; called it &quot;perhaps the most entertaining mid-day pick-me-up ever created.&quot; Hamilton: An American Musical used some beatboxing in &quot;Aaron Burr, Sir&quot;.

Beatboxing can often be seen in national advertisements. A GEICO radio commercial, featuring a supermarket employee beatboxing various announcements over a store intercom (&quot;Cleanup on aisle 14&quot; with beats interspersed), won the Westwood One Sports Sounds Awards Media Choice Award for best commercial heard during the radio network&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl LII. A 2021 national M&amp;M&#x27;s commercial seen in Times Square features American beatbox looping champion SungBeats.

<doc id="467124" wikidata="Q1280664" url="?curid=467124" title="Mission Earth (novel series)">
<text>Mission Earth is a ten-volume science fiction novel series by L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard died three months after the publication of volume 1, and other volumes were published posthumously.

The series&#x27;s initial publisher, Bridge Publications, coined the word &quot;dekalogy&quot;, meaning &quot;a series of ten books&quot;, to describe and promote the novel. Made up of about 1.2 million words, the epic is a &quot;satirical science fiction adventure set in the far future&quot;. Each volume in the series topped numerous bestseller lists. The second volume, &quot;Black Genesis&quot;, was nominated for the 1987 Hugo Award in the Best Novel category. It lost to &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;.

==Plot==
The Voltarians want to conquer the planet Earth (Blito-P3, according to Voltarian astrocharts) to use as a gas station for their planned invasion of the galactic center. The Voltarians come to the conclusion that the indigenous inhabitants of Earth will destroy the planet through pollution and possibly war, which would disrupt the future of their invasion timetable. Royal Combat Engineer Jettero Heller, a character of perfection, incorruptibility, and astonishing ability, is assigned to save Earth from the Earthlings. Reaching New York City, he investigates the problem, unaware that he is being tracked and that factions on Voltar want his mission to fail.

Unknown to Heller, Earth is also the base of a secret operation conducted by the diabolically evil Lombar Hisst, head of the Voltarian Coordinated Information Apparatus (CIA), who seeks to usurp the Voltarian throne. To gain control, Hisst has been importing illegal narcotic drugs from Earth to enslave the heads of government on Voltar. Hisst works to make Heller fail in his mission.

Hisst assigns a stooge named Soltan Gris to supervise the mission to Earth, in order to sabotage it. Gris finds himself in possession of twelve tons of pure gold, which he tries to launder through a Swiss bank account and keep for himself. He then becomes a prisoner of two man-hating lesbians who end up marrying him, but not before various tortures are inflicted upon him. He has terrible money and girlfriend troubles, and he hires a hit man who eventually targets him.

Heller discovers a conspiracy headed by Delbert John Rockecenter, who keeps the population of Earth sedated with drugs and rock and roll music. Heller&#x27;s attempts to break the demonic control of Earth by Rockecenter make him a target, and the corporation uses its most dangerous weapons to destroy him: psychiatry and psychology, and a mad, idealistic public relations genius by the name of J. Walter Madison, aka J. Warbler Madman. Madison initiates a wide-reaching public relations campaign to make Heller known to the world as the &quot;Whiz Kid,&quot; but results in destroying Heller&#x27;s reputation so that all of Heller&#x27;s efforts to save the planet come to naught, as Madison&#x27;s employer, Rockecenter, wanted. Heller&#x27;s outstanding skills and abilities are reinforced by the arrival on Earth of his fiancée, the Countess Krak, and the alliance and friendship of the Mafia—specifically the Corleone family.

After a series of world-shattering events, which include the impact of an ice meteor on the Soviet Union, the world&#x27;s entire oil supply being turned radioactive, and a black hole orbiting the Earth, Heller returns to Voltar to find that not only have Hisst&#x27;s plans to enslave the government nearly succeeded, but Madison is starting a galactic civil war.

After the defeat of Hisst and Madison, a massive cover-up operation commences to wipe out the effects of PR, psychology, and psychiatry. All mention of these subjects is censored and the planet Earth is eradicated from all star charts and similar items. As far as the Voltarians are concerned, planet Earth no longer exists.

==Public reaction==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; describes the series &quot;whose farcical overemphases fail to disguise an overblown tale that would have been more at home in the dawn of pulp magazines&quot;.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the first volume, &quot;The Invaders Plan&quot;, describes it thus: &quot;... a paralyzingly slow-moving adventure enlivened by interludes of kinky sex, sendups of effeminate homosexuals and a disregard of conventional grammar so global as to suggest a satire on the possibility of communication through language&quot;.

In &quot;L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology&quot;, a survey of Hubbard&#x27;s literary career, Marco Frenschkowski of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz described the &quot;Mission Earth&quot; series:

:The satire is not humorous, but biting and harsh, which makes the novels not easy to read. Also Hubbard somehow had lost contact with developing narrative techniques: he writes exactly as he had done 40 years earlier. When read as entertainment &quot;Mission Earth&quot; is disappointing: it does not entertain. Many of the scenes (especially some sexual encounters) are incredibly grotesque, not in a pornographic sense, but they are violently aggressive about modern American ideals. The &quot;Mission Earth&quot; novels on the whole are a subversive, harsh, poignant attack on American society in the 1980s. As such they have so far received almost no attention, which perhaps they do deserve a bit more. They also have some quite interesting characters, especially when read with a deconstructionist approach. These 11 later novels by Hubbard are not Scientology literature, but have some topics in common, especially the very strong opposition against 20th-century psychology and psychiatry, which is seen as a major source of evil. All open allusions to Scientology are strictly avoided. They are not as successful in their use of suspense and humour as Hubbard&#x27;s early tales, but have to say perhaps more about the complex personality of their author.

===Censorship attempt===
In 1991, the town of Dalton, Georgia attempted to remove the &quot;Mission Earth&quot; books from its public library, citing what was described as &quot;repeated passages involving chronic masochism, child abuse, homosexuality, necromancy, bloody murder, and other things that are anti-social, perverted, and anti-everything&quot;. The attempt was unsuccessful, though this placed the &quot;Mission Earth&quot; series into the category of banned books that have been challenged in the United States.

==Bestseller designation==
The &quot;Mission Earth&quot; books were a major sales success, particularly the earlier volumes in the series, with all individual volumes reaching the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The extent to which this reflects actual popularity is questioned. A large number of booksellers, publishing executives, and former Scientologists state that, as with other Hubbard books, the Church of Scientology engaged in a massive book-buying campaign, similar to the campaign to promote &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, so as to deliberately inflate sales of the series in order to promote it as a best-selling work of literature.

In a two-year span, Hubbard logged 14 consecutive books on the &quot;New York Times&quot; list. Adam Clymer, a &quot;New York Times&quot; executive, said that while the books have been sold in sufficient numbers to justify their bestseller status, &quot;we don&#x27;t know to whom they were sold&quot;. He said the newspaper uncovered no instances in which vast quantities of books were being sold to single individuals.

<doc id="467133" wikidata="Q3510843" url="?curid=467133" title="Senate of Fiji">
<text>The Senate of Fiji was the upper chamber of Parliament. It was abolished by the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, after a series of military coups. It was the less powerful of the two chambers; it could not initiate legislation, but could amend or veto it. The Senate&#x27;s powers over financial bills were more restricted: it could veto them in their entirety, but could not amend them. The House of Representatives could override a senatorial veto by passing the bill a second time in the parliamentary session immediately following the one in which it was rejected by the Senate, after a minimum period of six months. Amendments to the Constitution were excepted: the veto of the Senate was absolute. Following the passage of a bill by the House of Representatives, the Senate had 21 days (7 days in the case of a bill classified as &quot;urgent&quot;) to approve, amend, or reject it; if at the expiry of that period the Senate had done nothing about it, it was deemed to have passed the bill.

== Composition ==

The Senate had 32 members. Formally, they were appointed by the president for five-year terms coinciding with the term of the House of Representatives. Constitutionally, however, the president was required to accept the nominees of specified institutions. Fourteen senators were chosen by the &quot;Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; (Great Council of Chiefs), though in practice it had chosen to delegate this prerogative to Fiji&#x27;s 14 &quot;provincial councils,&quot; each choosing one senator. A further nine senators were chosen by the prime minister and eight by the leader of the opposition. The one remaining senator was selected by the Council of Rotuma, a Fijian dependency.

From among their own members, the senators used to elect a president and vice-president, whose roles were similar to those of the speaker and deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively. As of September 2006, the president of the Senate was Ratu Kinijoji Maivalili; the vice-president was Hafiz Khan. They were chosen in June 2006 to replace Taito Waqavakatoga and Kenneth Low, both of whom had retired from the Senate.

The built-in near-majority of Fijian chiefs in the Senate gave them an effective veto over contentious social legislation, as well as constitutional amendments, provided they voted as a block, as they would almost certainly be joined by enough other senators to muster a majority. In addition, any changes to clauses of the constitution guaranteeing indigenous Fijian ownership and control of most of the land had to be approved by 9 of the 14 senators chosen by the Great Council of Chiefs, as well as by a majority in the Senate as a whole.

Senators, like their fellow-parliamentarians from the House of Representatives, could be appointed to the Cabinet – the executive arm of government.

== History ==
The Fijian Senate came into being in 1972, when the old unicameral Legislative Council was replaced by the bicameral Parliament. The Senate was restructured twice after the original constitutional structures went into effect.

From 1972 to 1987, the Senate consisted of 22 members. Appointed by the governor-general on the nomination of the Great Council of Chiefs (8), the prime minister (7), the leader of the opposition (6), and the council of Rotuma (1), senators served six-year terms, with half retiring every three years. The first term of office for half of the nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs and of the leader of the opposition, three of the seven nominees of the prime minister, and the lone Rotuman senator, was for three years only, ending in 1975. The Senate was a permanent body; it was never dissolved.

The Constitution was rewritten following two military coups in 1987. The Senate was expanded to 34 members appointed by the president for four-year terms, with half retiring every two years. The president appointed 24 senators on the nomination of the Great Council of Chiefs, 1 on the nomination of the Council of Rotuma, and a further 9 at his own discretion from the Indo-Fijian and minority communities. This arrangement was in effect from 1992 to 1999. The first term of 12 of the 24 senators nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs and 4 of the 9 appointed to represent other communities was for two years only, ending in 1994. As previously, the Senate was never dissolved.

Constitutional arrangements came into effect in 1997–1998, and the first Senate so appointed took office in 1999. For the first time, all senators served concurrent, five-year terms, coinciding with the term of the House of Representatives.

== Membership ==

As of 28 September 2006, the Fijian Senate comprised the following persons:

=== Nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs ===

=== Nominated by the prime minister ===

=== Nominated by the leader of the opposition ===
=== Nominated by the Council of Rotuma ===

<text>The Java Sea (, ) is an extensive shallow sea on the Sunda Shelf, between the Indonesian islands of Borneo to the north, Java to the south, Sumatra to the west, and Sulawesi to the east. Karimata Strait to its northwest links it to the South China Sea. Although generally considered to be a part of the western Pacific Ocean, the Java Sea is occasionally considered to be a part of the Indian Ocean.

==Geography==
The Java Sea covers the southern section of the Sunda Shelf.
A shallow sea, it has a mean depth of . It measures about east-west by north-south and occupies a total surface area of .

It formed as sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age. Its almost uniformly flat bottom, and the presence of drainage channels (traceable to the mouths of island rivers), indicate that the Sunda Shelf was once a stable, dry, low-relief land area (peneplain) above which were left standing a few monadnocks (granite hills that, due to their resistance to erosion, form the present islands).

===Extent===

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Java Sea as one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago, with the following criteria:

&quot;On the North.&quot; By the Southern limit of the South China Sea [Lucipara Point () thence to Tanjong Nanka, the Southwest extremity of Bangka Island, through this island to Tanjong Berikat the Eastern point (), on to Tanjong Djemang () in Billiton, along the North coast of this island to Tanjong Boeroeng Mandi () and thence a line to Tanjong Sambar () the Southwest extreme of Borneo], the South coast of Borneo and the Southern limit of Makassar Strait [By a line from the Southwestern extreme of Celebes (), through the Southern point of Tana Keke, to the Southern extreme of Laoet () thence up the West coast of that island to Tanjong Kiwi and thence across to Tanjong Petang, Borneo () at the Southern end of Laoet Strait].

&quot;On the East.&quot; By the Western limit of Flores Sea [A line from Tg Sarokaja () to the Western Paternoster island () thence to the Northeastern Postiljon Island () and to the West point of Laikang Bay, Celebes].

&quot;On the South.&quot; By the Northern and Northwestern limits of Bali Sea [A line from the Western Paternoster Island to the East point of Sepandjang and thence through this island to the West point of Gedeh Bay on the South coast of Kangean (). A line from the West point of Gedeh Bay, Kangean Island, to Tg Sedano, the Northeast extreme of Java and down the East coast to Tg Bantenan, the Southeast extreme of the island], the North and West coasts of Java to Java Hoofd () its Western point, and thence a line to Vlakke Hoek () the Southern extreme of Sumatra.

&quot;On the West.&quot; The East coast of Sumatra between Vlakke Hoek and Lucipara Point ().
==History==

The Battle of the Java Sea from February to March 1942, was one of the costliest naval battles of World War II. The naval forces of the Netherlands, Britain, Australia, and the United States were nearly destroyed trying to defend Java from Japanese attack.

===Incident===
On 28 December 2014, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the Java Sea while on route to Singapore from Surabaya, East Java. All 162 passengers and crew were killed.

On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta heading towards Depati Amir Airport in Pangkal Pinang. All 189 passengers and crew on board are dead.

On 9 January 2021, a Boeing 737-500 (PK-CLC) operating as Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, crashed, near Laki Island, shortly after taking off from Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, en route to Supadio International Airport, with 50 passengers and 12 crew members aboard.

==Economic activities==

The southern section of the seafloor has long been recognized as geologically similar to northern Java, where oil fields occur and extend under the sea. Prospects are also favorable for oil fields in the waters off southeast Kalimantan. As the site of successful exploration for petroleum and natural gas, the Java Sea has become the basis of Indonesia&#x27;s export program.

Fishing is an important economic activity in the Java Sea. Over 3,000 species of marine life are found in the area. A number of national parks exist in the area such as Karimunjawa. The Thousand Islands are located north of the national capital Jakarta, and are the city&#x27;s only regency.

The area around the Java Sea is also a popular tourist destination. Scuba diving offers a chance to explore and photograph underwater caverns, wrecks, coral, sponges, and other marine life.

<doc id="467145" wikidata="Q506290" url="?curid=467145" title="Glasgow Subway">
<text>The Glasgow Subway is an underground light metro system in Glasgow, Scotland. Opened on 14 December 1896, it is the third-oldest underground metro system in the world after the Metropolitan Railway in London, 1863, and the Budapest Metro, 1896. It is also one of the very few railways in the world with a track running gauge of . Originally a cable railway, the subway was later electrified, but the double-track circular line was never expanded. The line was originally known as the Glasgow District Subway, and was thus the first mass transit system to be known as a &quot;subway&quot;; it was later renamed Glasgow Subway Railway. In 1936 it was renamed the Glasgow Underground. Despite this rebranding, many Glaswegians continued to refer to the network as &quot;the Subway&quot;. In 2003, the name &quot;Subway&quot; was officially readopted by its operator, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT).

The system is not the oldest underground railway in Glasgow: that distinction belongs to a section of the Glasgow City and District Railway opened in 1886, now part of the North Clyde Line of the suburban railway network, which runs in a tunnel under the city centre between High Street and west of Charing Cross. Another major section of underground suburban railway line in Glasgow is the Argyle Line, which was formerly part of the Glasgow Central Railway.

==Route==
The subway system was constructed as a circular loop almost long and extends both north and south of the River Clyde. The tracks have the unusual narrow gauge of and a nominal tunnel diameter of , even smaller than that of the deep-level lines of the London Underground ( at their smallest); consequently, the rolling stock for the Glasgow Subway is considerably smaller.

The system is described as two lines, the Outer Circle and Inner Circle, which simply refers to the double track, having trains running clockwise and anticlockwise respectively around the same route in separate tunnels. Stations use a variety of platform layouts including single island platforms, opposing side platforms and in some stations such as Hillhead one side and one island platform.

The subway&#x27;s running lines are entirely underground, although the maintenance depot at Broomloan Road (located between the and stations) is above ground, as was the earlier depot, also at Govan. Prior to modernisation, trains used to be lifted by crane onto and off the tracks. Modernisation brought the installation of points and an access ramp between Govan and Ibrox where trains can exit the tunnel system for maintenance, cleaning or storage.

Power is supplied to the trains at 600 V DC, using a third rail, via sub-stations at five locations on the circle: Broomloan Depot, Byres Road (Hillhead), Dundasvale (Cowcaddens), Bridge Street and Cornwall Street (Kinning Park). In the event of maintenance or repair work, the system can operate a full service (six trains per circle) with one of the sub-stations inoperative.

The system is owned and operated by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), formerly Strathclyde Passenger Transport, and carried 12.7 million passengers in the period 2019–20. The Subway has been policed by British Transport Police since 2007.

==History==
===1896–1977===
The Glasgow District Subway Company began construction of the underground in 1891 and it opened on 14 December 1896. The subway was powered by a clutch-and-cable system, with one cable for each direction.

The cable was driven from a steam-powered plant between and stations. There was no additional cable to allow trains to reach the depot; instead, they were transferred to and from the running lines by crane operating over a pit at the Govan workshops. This also meant that the two tracks could be completely separate, with no points anywhere. The company&#x27;s headquarters were in the upper rooms at St Enoch subway station; this distinctive ornate building still stands in St Enoch Square and was subsequently used as a travel information office by SPT and is now a coffee shop.

When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four axle (twin truck) trains were operated. Late in the evening on the opening day, after 11 pm, one car laden with 60 passengers was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed the closure of the Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson &amp; Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to air-operated sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.

All 15 stations were built with island platforms. The trains were thus built with doors on one side only. Power for the electric lighting in the trains was supplied by two parallel wall-mounted rails (known as &quot;T-irons&quot;) at window level on the non-platform side of the trains; trains were originally equipped with wheels to pick up the electricity but changed to skids at electrification. The trains remained cable-hauled until 1935, though the anachronistic way of supplying power for the lighting continued until 1977. The lighting circuit was also part of the operation of the signalling system.

Opening times of the Glasgow Subway have varied through the years, now open 06:30 to 23:40 Monday to Saturday and 10:00 to 18:12 on Sunday following a trial period between April 2011 and 2012 when the subway was open from 09:00–18:30.

Glasgow Corporation took over the company in 1923 at a cost of £385,000 (). In 1935, the existing trains were converted to electric power delivered by a third rail at 600 volts, direct current. From March until December 1935, clockwise trains were cable-hauled, while anti-clockwise ones were electric. The conversion to electric traction cost £120,000 (). The last cable drawn car service was on 30 November 1935, and was driven by Robert Boyd.

The trains lost their original plum and cream-coloured liveries, being painted red and white instead. From the 1950s the trains became all red—in a shade similar to that of London buses. During the early 1970s, trailer carriage number 41 was repainted in the original 1896 livery.

According to Keith Anderson World War II brought an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level of use by passengers. Anderson attributes this, and an increase in patronage in the years leading up to the conflict, to the expansion of the local shipyard workforce due to the need for rearmament. Unlike its larger counterpart in London the system&#x27;s stations did not make good air-raid shelters as they were much less deep. On 18 September 1940, during World War II, a German bomb, which dropped during a night raid on Glasgow and may have been intended for nearby naval facilities, landed on a bowling green to the south of Merkland Street station. The resulting explosion caused damage to both tunnels, leading to closure of part of the system until repairs were completed in January 1941. The system suffered no other damage during the conflict. It did lose staff who were called up to participate in the war effort.

After the Beeching Axe of the 1960s, both and mainline stations were closed and demolished; there was no direct connection between the underground and mainline stations of Buchanan Street as they were over distant. The Subway had no direct passenger connection to the national railway network—a major weakness—although Buchanan Street and Merkland Street stations were a short walk from Queen Street and Partickhill British Rail stations respectively.

The trains (mostly dating back to 1896) were always formed with two carriages—the front (motor) carriage with red leather seats and the rear (trailer) carriage with brown leather seats. Smoking was permitted in the rear carriage only. The backs of the seats were attached to the sides of the carriages, which moved semi-independently from the floor (to which the seats themselves were attached); passengers were rocked forward and backward while the carriage &#x27;shoogled&#x27; them around. Passengers always entered at the middle of the train (&quot;Q Here&quot; signs were painted on the platforms), leaving by the front door of the front carriage or the rear door of the rear carriage.

By the 1970s, the stations were very dilapidated. Surface access to most stations had been largely built into existing buildings and their entrances often formed part of shop frontages ( being the only surviving example of this in the post-modernised era), and with many of these structures being destroyed during the slum clearances of the 1960s, often only the station access was left standing. Stations were marked with circular signs often attached to lampposts. This sign had a white background in the top three-quarters (containing a large red letter &quot;U&quot;) and black in the bottom quarter (containing the word &quot;Underground&quot; and an arrow to the station entrance). No station had an escalator; had a lift. Each station had a ticket office (often very small, little more than a booth with a window). The ticketing system was identical to that of most cinemas of the era, with tickets emerging from slots in the counters of the station ticket offices (the words &quot;Control Systems Ltd&quot; or &quot;Automaticket Ltd&quot; were printed on all tickets). Tickets were invariably collected on leaving the train. From the time of being taken over by the Corporation until 1977, the staff were issued with tramway uniforms; these were dark green and had a black braid on the cuffs which had been introduced at the time of the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901.

The Glasgow Museum of Transport had an area dedicated to the subway, with models showing the operation of the clutch-and-cable system, as well as a full-scale replica of part of a subway station, complete with different rolling stock of the pre-modernisation era.

===Modernisation (1977–1980)===
By the 1970s, use of the Subway had declined significantly. This was caused partly by the closure of some of the dockyards and by widescale demolition of tenements south of the River Clyde. The original carriages, mostly dating back to 1896, were still in use, though adapted for electric traction in 1935. Breakdowns were becoming increasingly frequent; because trains could only be removed from the tracks to the depot by crane, a single inoperable train could cause major delays. The future of the Subway became a major issue for the Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive (GGPTE), which took over responsibility for the line from Glasgow Corporation in the early 1970s. In January 1974 GGPTE announced a modernisation programme would be undertaken. The original plan would have seen trains continue to run on the system, with one of the two circles continuing to run while the other was upgraded. This idea was abandoned as expert advice suggested a safety risk.
On 24 March 1977, cracks were noticed in the roof of Govan Cross station, leading to suspension of services until 2 May. The service resumed with only four trains per circle. On 21 May 1977, the system was shut down eight days prematurely for a major refurbishment and modernisation; the date was brought forward because of the appearance of more cracks in the Govan Cross roof. Badly deteriorated tunnels were repaired; stations were rebuilt and enlarged, with additional platforms at Buchanan Street, Partick, Govan, Ibrox, Hillhead and St Enoch. The surface building of St George&#x27;s Cross had already been rebuilt in 1971 as part of the construction of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road, and therefore was merely re-clad in the new corporate style. The entrance to Kelvinbridge was reversed, with a new entrance and car park built at South Woodside Road, an escalator to Great Western Road and stairs down to the west end of the platform; the former entrance and stairway at the east end became an emergency exit, and the lift was withdrawn from service. Merkland Street station was closed (thus becoming a ghost station); a new station to the north was built at Partick to provide an interchange with the North Clyde Line of the suburban rail system. The site of Merkland Street can be noticed by the characteristic hump and the larger-diameter tunnel with both tracks. Many fittings from Merkland Street were used to build a replica pre-modernisation station at the Glasgow Museum of Transport which contained three preserved cars.

A further interchange via moving walkway was installed between Buchanan Street station and Queen Street mainline station as part of the modernisation.
In August 1977, all redundant fittings and equipment from the old system were sold at a public sale at Broomloan Works. During the 1977–1980 modernisation, two Clayton battery locomotives were used by the contractors Taylor Woodrow to haul construction trains.

Heavier track was installed although still at the unique gauge, the original Broomloan Depot was modernised and equipped with connecting tracks with points to replace the crane transfer, and a new electrical supply from Westinghouse Electric Corporation was installed. A new ticketing system, provided by Crouzet, with passenger-operated ticket vending machines and automatic turnstile barriers, replaced the old, perforated cinema-style tickets and conductors. The post-1980 yellow tickets have since been replaced by a newer system, issuing magnetic stripe card tickets.

The modernised system uses automatic train operation with the driver only responsible for closing the doors and pressing a &quot;start&quot; button in normal operation.

While the system was closed a replacement bus service was introduced by GGPTE in a bid to retain customers. Service 66 covered the inner circle route, while service 99 covered the route taken by the outer circle.

====Since modernisation====
The modernised Subway (alongside the rebuilt Argyle Line) was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 November 1979, who rode the train along with Prince Philip from Buchanan Street to St Enoch. Rebuilding work was however still incomplete, and the actual reopening to passengers did not occur until 16 April 1980. Thirty-three new carriages were built by Metro-Cammell at its Washwood Heath works in Birmingham, and equipped with GEC electric motors. The exterior design of the trains was carried out in partnership with Glasgow School of Art, which, according to SPT publicity films of the day, was largely responsible for the trains&#x27; &quot;cute&quot; appearance. Eight additional centre-trailer carriages were built in 1992 (the body shells by Hunslet Gyro Mining Transport in Leeds for completion by Hunslet-Barclay in Kilmarnock), making all trains three carriages long. Smoking has never been permitted on the modernised system.

A new corporate identity was introduced (following contemporary fashions of the 1970s), with trains painted bright orange, stations largely rebuilt with dark brown bricks, orange-yellow wall tiles and other surfaces in off-white, plus brown uniforms for the staff. Large, illuminated orange &quot;U&quot; signs were placed at station entrances (since removed, with the re-adoption of the name &quot;Subway&quot;). Since the 1990s, ongoing renovation work has resulted in most stations adopting individual colour schemes. The trains&#x27; initial orange livery of 1980 (with a white stripe) was soon replaced by a darker, more durable shade of orange, later being replaced by SPT&#x27;s carmine-red and cream livery.

The system was resignalled using Vital Processor Interlocking in 1996 and subsequently an upgraded Supervisory &amp; Control System was installed.

===Further modernisation (2000s)===

A £40,000 study examining the feasibility of an expansion into the city&#x27;s south side was conducted in 2005, and in 2007 Labour further committed to extend the line to the East End, but to no avail.

New electronic destination signs were installed in the stations in 2008.

The Partick station modernisation project was completed in 2009, and resulted in a complete redevelopment at the station, which hosts a railway station, a subway station and a bus terminal on the outside.

In April 2010, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport approved outline plans for a £290 million upgrade of the Subway—the first since the comprehensive modernisation of the late 1970s. Plans included additional safety measures, improved accessibility and smart technology such as electronic tickets. The proposals were approved by the Scottish Government in March 2011, and changes to be brought in included:
* integrated smartcard ticketing
* new driverless trains
* improved signalling with automation
* refurbishing all subway stations, including making stations more accessible, as well as safer with platform screen doors.

The first station to be modernised was . This began in 2011 and finished in 2012. The work included the retiling of all the walls and floors, the replacement of escalators, a new ticket office, better way finding and also a piece of public art.

Further plans were announced to modernise Ibrox and Kelvinhall stations before the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Furthermore, all other stations were planned to receive updated branding prior to modernisation work being carried out on them, so as to achieve unity in design.

In March 2016, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) awarded contracts to Stadler and Ansaldo STS for the supply of 17 new driverless trains for the Subway. The first was delivered in May 2019. Testing on the Subway started on 5 December 2021. The first new trains were previously expected to operate in 2022. The first passenger service with the new trains operated on 11 December 2023, with the third generation trains fully replacing the second generation after their withdrawal on 28 June 2024.

==Future development and Clyde Metro==

The Glasgow Subway system is the only metro system never to have been expanded from its original route in 125 years, although a report published in 2018 summarised various extension plans from 1937 onwards.

In early 2005, SPT announced that they would employ consultants to look into extending the system in the West End, East End, South Side and Glasgow Harbour areas of the city. The extension would take advantage of existing unused tunnels underneath the city, and there is a possibility that roads would be dug up to install tunnels before being replaced and resurfaced (cut-and-cover tunnelling).

On 14 March 2007, SPT announced the plans that the consultants had recommended. These included major refurbishment of the existing rolling stock and stations, at an overall cost of £270 million. The expansion of the existing network was also considered at a cost of £2.3 billion, including a new East End Circle, with seven new stations at St Mungo&#x27;s, Onslow, Duke Street, Celtic Park, Dalmarnock, Newhall and Gorbals. The aim was to improve transport links in an area of the city which is currently poorly served by rail, in the hope that this would aid regeneration, and the city&#x27;s 2014 Commonwealth Games bid. This circle would interchange at , and . Other proposals include extending the system southwards to Cathcart and further westwards to the SEC Centre and Maryhill using an older railway line.

In 2007, SPT produced a report that showed huge support for a Subway extension. Councillor Alistair Watson of the SPT stated:
The plans were expected to take twelve years, but never came to fruition.

Crossrail Glasgow proposals by Glasgow City Council featured a feasibility study conducted by SPT, which included a proposed new West Street railway station which would interface with the West Street station on the Subway network.
The Glasgow Connectivity Commission, established by Glasgow City Council in 2017, has also suggested a Glasgow Metro. This would involve repurposing or reopening existing heavy rail lines, the creation of additional light rail metro, and the construction of an airport rail link.

===Clyde Metro===

In 2022, Transport Scotland published its final version of the Strategic Transport Projects Review 2, which outlines proposals for the Clyde Metro. The Clyde Metro proposals retain the Subway, and also note the potential for a new station at West Street.

==Connections==
Before the 1970s modernisation, the Subway offered no formal connections to other transport at ground level, although in practice two stations, Merkland Street and Buchanan Street, were only a short walk from British Rail stations. These links were improved at this modernisation:
* At , the system connects with the North Clyde and Argyle lines of the Glasgow suburban railway network. This was achieved by physically relocating the original railway station at Partickhill, as well as moving and renaming the Merkland Street station.
* A connecting moving walkway, linking Buchanan Street station to Queen Street main-line station.
* and Argyle Street railway stations (for the Argyle Line) are both a short walk from St Enoch subway station, and most stations connect with bus routes.

==Stations==
== Rolling stock ==
=== First generation (1896–1977) ===

The first rolling stock was largely built in 1896, with additional trailer carriages added over the following 20 years. This rolling stock was converted from cable to electric traction in 1935 and finally withdrawn from service in 1977 upon the closure of the railway for modernisation.

=== Second generation (1980–2024) ===
The first 33 cars of the second generation fleet were built by Metro-Cammell, Washwood Heath between 1977 and 1979. Eight additional trailer cars were built in 1992. The rolling stock entered service when the subway re-opened after modernisation work on 16 April 1980. The original 33 were refurbished by ABB at Derby Litchurch Lane Works in 1995. The second generation fleet was entirely retired from service on 28 June 2024.

=== Third generation (2023–present) ===

Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) unveiled a £200M contract with Stadler and Ansaldo STS in 2016 for modernisation of the Subway, including new driverless rolling stock. These trains were expected to enter service after the modernisation completed in 2020; however the trains entered passenger service in December 2023. The trains were built by Stadler Rail at their factory in Altenrhein in eastern Switzerland.

==Fares and ticketing==

The Glasgow Subway uses a structure rather than a distance-based fare structure. A ticket allows passengers to stay on the Subway for as long as they like.

Tickets are sold as paper tickets, or electronically on a Subway Smartcard. Smartcard ticket prices are discounted slightly from paper ticket prices, and feature a daily cap lower than the paper return ticket and significantly cheaper than the paper all-day ticket. A smartcard is required for any form of season ticket (seven days, four weeks, six months or one year).

Smartcards are available online for free, or for £3 from stations.

All tickets are available at any station either through a machine or at the ticket office. Tickets must be &#x27;tapped&#x27; on the card reader to validate the ticket and must be retained for exit.

SPT&#x27;s Zonecard is also valid on the Subway as long as it is valid in zone 1.

The concession fare is for disabled or elderly individuals who are holders of a National Entitlement Card that has been issued by SPT.

==Services==
The Subway runs from 06:30 to 23:40 Monday to Saturday and 10:00 to 18:12 on Sunday. Trains run every 6–8 minutes during off-peak periods on both Inner (Anti-Clockwise) and Outer (Clockwise) services.

==iShoogle==
In September 2012 SPT launched an app for Apple iPhones and Android smartphones called iShoogle which allows users to &quot;Check in&quot; using Facebook at Subway stations. Shoogle guide does a search of local area amenities such as bars, shops, cafes, banks and entertainment that are near subway stations, there are local area maps using Apple Maps or Google Maps as well as the official SPT map and timetables of the first and last trains and photos from SPT&#x27;s archives. The app also has facts about the Subway.

==Cultural references ==
===Nicknames===

The origin of the Subway&#x27;s supposed, but seldom used outside the press, nickname, &quot;The Clockwork Orange&quot; (coined from the title of the book and film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) is subject to dispute. Some believe that it was originally coined by the media of the period, while others credit it to the then chairman of British Rail, Sir Peter Parker, who was quoted in a late 1970s publicity video of the new trains as saying &quot;so these are the original Clockwork Orange&quot;. Most of its carriages were painted orange (although called &quot;Strathclyde PTE red&quot; because &quot;Orange&quot; has sectarian connotations in Glasgow), the corporate colour of Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive at the time.

While the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; nickname is often used in tourist guidebooks and local literature, it is virtually unused by locals, who will refer to the system simply as &quot;the Subway&quot; or &quot;the Underground&quot;.

Prior to the introduction of new trains in the 1970s, the name &quot;Shoogly Train&quot; (&quot;shoogly&quot; meaning &quot;shaky&quot; in the Scots language) was used because the design of the cars allowed a degree of movement or &quot;shoogle&quot; between the backrest and squab of each seat.

===&quot;The Underground Song&quot;===
The celebrated Glaswegian writer and broadcaster Cliff Hanley composed a satirical song about the pre-modernisation era Subway entitled &quot;The Underground Song&quot;. It was popular as a stage piece performed by the comedians Rikki Fulton and Jack Milroy in their Francie and Josie act.

The chorus of the song is:
===The Subcrawl===
The Glasgow Subway and its adjacent public houses are the focal point of a pub crawl known as the Subcrawl. Participants buy an all day ticket, disembark at each of the 15 stations and have a drink in the nearest bar.

<text>Radiative forcing (or climate forcing) is a concept used to quantify a change to the balance of energy flowing through a planetary atmosphere. Various factors contribute to this change in energy balance, such as concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and changes in surface albedo and solar irradiance. In more technical terms, it is defined as &quot;the change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux (expressed in W/m2) due to a change in an external driver of climate change.&quot; These external drivers are distinguished from feedbacks and variability that are internal to the climate system, and that further influence the direction and magnitude of imbalance. Radiative forcing on Earth is meaningfully evaluated at the tropopause and at the top of the stratosphere. It is quantified in units of watts per square meter, and often summarized as an average over the total surface area of the globe.

A planet in radiative equilibrium with its parent star and the rest of space can be characterized by net zero radiative forcing and by a planetary equilibrium temperature.

Radiative forcing is not &quot;a thing&quot; in the sense that a single instrument can independently measure it. Rather it is a scientific concept and entity whose strength can be estimated from more fundamental physics principles. Scientists use measurements of changes in atmospheric parameters to calculate the radiative forcing.

The IPCC summarized the current scientific consensus about radiative forcing changes as follows: &quot;Human-caused radiative forcing of 2.72 W/m2 in 2019 relative to 1750 has warmed the climate system. This warming is mainly due to increased GHG concentrations, partly reduced by cooling due to increased aerosol concentrations&quot;.

The atmospheric burden of greenhouse gases due to human activity has grown especially rapidly during the last several decades (since about year 1950). For carbon dioxide, the 50% increase (&quot;C/C0&quot; = 1.5) realized as of year 2020 since 1750 corresponds to a cumulative radiative forcing change (ΔF) of +2.17 W/m2. Assuming no change in the emissions growth path, a doubling of concentrations (&quot;C/C0&quot; = 2) within the next several decades would correspond to a cumulative radiative forcing change (ΔF) of +3.71 W/m2.

Radiative forcing can be a useful way to compare the growing warming influence of different anthropogenic greenhouse gases over time. The radiative forcing of long-lived and well-mixed greenhouse gases have been increasing in earth&#x27;s atmosphere since the industrial revolution. Carbon dioxide has the biggest impact on total forcing, while methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) play smaller roles as time goes on. The five major greenhouse gases account for about 96% of the direct radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gas increases since 1750. The remaining 4% is contributed by the 15 minor halogenated gases.
== Definition and fundamentals ==
&quot;Radiative forcing&quot; is defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report as follows: &quot;The change in the net, downward minus upward, radiative flux (expressed in W/m2) due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), the concentration of volcanic aerosols or the output of the Sun.&quot;

There are some different types of radiative forcing as defined in the literature:

* &quot;Stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing: &quot;&quot;when all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium.&quot;
* &quot;Instantaneous radiative forcing:&quot; &quot;if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for&quot;. 
* &quot;Effective radiative forcing&quot;: &quot;once both stratospheric and tropospheric adjustments are accounted for&quot;.

The radiation balance of the Earth (i.e. the balance between absorbed and radiated energy) determines the average global temperature. This balance is also called Earth&#x27;s energy balance. Changes to this balance occur due to factors such as the intensity of solar energy, reflectivity of clouds or gases, absorption by various greenhouse gases or surfaces and heat emission by various materials. Any such alteration is a &quot;radiative forcing&quot;, which along with its climate feedbacks, ultimately changes the balance. This happens continuously as sunlight hits the surface of Earth, clouds and aerosols form, the concentrations of atmospheric gases vary and seasons alter the groundcover.

&quot;Positive radiative forcing&quot; means Earth receives more incoming energy from sunlight than it radiates to space. This net gain of energy will cause global warming. Conversely, &quot;negative radiative forcing&quot; means that Earth loses more energy to space than it receives from the Sun, which produces cooling (global dimming). 

=== History ===
Transport of energy and matter in the Earth-atmosphere system is governed by the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and more generally non-equilibrium thermodynamics. During the first half of the 20th century, physicists developed a comprehensive description of radiative transfer that they began to apply to stellar and planetary atmospheres in radiative equilibrium. Studies of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) followed and matured through the 1960s and 1970s. RCE models began to account for more complex material flows within the energy balance, such as those from a water cycle, and thereby described observations better.

Another application of equilibrium models is that a perturbation in the form of an externally imposed intervention can estimate a change in state. The RCE work distilled this into a &quot;forcing-feedback framework&quot; for change, and produced climate sensitivity results agreeing with those from GCMs. This conceptual framework asserts that a homogeneous disturbance (effectively imposed onto the top-of-atmosphere energy balance) will be met by slower responses (correlated more or less with changes in a planet&#x27;s surface temperature) to bring the system to a new equilibrium state. &quot;Radiative forcing&quot; was a term used to describe these disturbances and gained widespread traction in the literature by the 1980s.

=== Related metrics ===
The concept of radiative forcing has been evolving from the initial proposal, named nowadays &quot;instantaneous radiative forcing&quot; (IRF), to other proposals that aim to relate better the radiative imbalance with global warming (global surface mean temperature). For example, researchers explained in 2003 how the &quot;adjusted troposphere and stratosphere forcing&quot; can be used in general circulation models. 

The adjusted radiative forcing, in its different calculation methodologies, estimates the imbalance once the stratosphere temperatures has been modified to achieve a radiative equilibrium in the stratosphere (in the sense of zero radiative heating rates). This new methodology is not estimating any &quot;adjustment&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot; that could be produced on the troposphere (in addition to stratospheric temperature adjustments), for that goal another definition, named &quot;effective radiative forcing&quot; has been introduced. In general the ERF is the recommendation of the CMIP6 radiative forcing analysis although the stratospherically adjusted methodologies are still being applied in those cases where the adjustments and feedbacks on the troposphere are considered not critical, like in the well mixed greenhouse gases and ozone. A methodology named &quot;radiative kernel approach&quot; allows to estimate the climate feedbacks within an offline calculation based on a linear approximation 

== Uses ==
=== Climate change attribution ===
Radiative forcing is used to quantify the strengths of different natural and man-made drivers of Earth&#x27;s energy imbalance over time. The detailed physical mechanisms by which these drivers cause the planet to warm or cool are varied. Radiative forcing allows the contribution of any one driver to be compared against others.

Another metric called &quot;effective radiative forcing&quot; or ERF removes the effect of rapid adjustments (so-called &quot;fast feedbacks&quot;) within the atmosphere that are unrelated to longer term surface temperature responses. ERF means that climate change drivers can be placed onto a more level playing field to enable comparison of their effects and a more consistent view of how global surface temperature responds to various types of human forcing.

=== Climate sensitivity ===
Radiative forcing and climate feedbacks can be used together to estimate a subsequent change in steady-state (often denoted &quot;equilibrium&quot;) surface temperature (Δ&quot;T&quot;s) via the equation:

: formula_1

where formula_2 is commonly denoted the climate sensitivity parameter, usually with units K/(W/m2), and Δ&quot;F&quot; is the radiative forcing in W/m2. An estimate for formula_2 is obtained from the inverse of the climate feedback parameter formula_4 having units (W/m2)/K. An estimated value of formula_5 gives an increase in global temperature of about 1.6 K above the 1750 reference temperature due to the increase in over that time (278 to 405 ppm, for a forcing of 2.0 W/m2), and predicts a further warming of 1.4 K above present temperatures if the mixing ratio in the atmosphere were to become double its pre-industrial value. Both of these calculations assume no other forcings.

Historically, radiative forcing displays the best predictive capacity for specific types of forcing such as greenhouse gases. It is less effective for other anthropogenic influences like soot.

== Calculations and measurements ==

=== Atmospheric observation ===

Earth&#x27;s global radiation balance fluctuates as the planet rotates and orbits the Sun, and as global-scale thermal anomalies arise and dissipate within the terrestrial, oceanic and atmospheric systems (e.g. ENSO). Consequently, the planet&#x27;s &#x27;instantaneous radiative forcing&#x27; (IRF) is also dynamic and naturally fluctuates between states of overall warming and cooling. The combination of periodic and complex processes that give rise to these natural variations will typically revert over periods lasting as long as a few years to produce a net-zero average IRF. Such fluctuations also mask the longer-term (decade-long) forcing trends due to human activities, and thus make direct observation of such trends challenging.
Earth&#x27;s radiation balance has been continuously monitored by NASA&#x27;s Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments since year 1998. Each scan of the globe provides an estimate of the total (all-sky) instantaneous radiation balance. This data record captures both the natural fluctuations and human influences on IRF; including changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, land surface, etc. The record also includes the lagging radiative responses to the radiative imbalances; occurring mainly by way of Earth system feedbacks in temperature, surface albedo, atmospheric water vapor and clouds.

Researchers have used measurements from CERES, AIRS, CloudSat and other satellite-based instruments within NASA&#x27;s Earth Observing System to parse out contributions by the natural fluctuations and system feedbacks. Removing these contributions within the multi-year data record allows observation of the anthropogenic trend in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) IRF. The data analysis has also been done in a way that is computationally efficient and independent of most related modelling methods and results. Radiative forcing was thus directly observed to have risen by +0.53 W m−2 (±0.11 W m−2) from years 2003 to 2018. About 20% of the increase was associated with a reduction in the atmospheric aerosol burden, and most of the remaining 80% was attributed to the rising burden of greenhouse gases.

A rising trend in the radiative imbalance due to increasing global has been previously observed by ground-based instruments. For example, such measurements have been separately gathered under clear-sky conditions at two Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites in Oklahoma and Alaska. Each direct observation found that the associated radiative (infrared) heating experienced by surface dwellers rose by +0.2 W m−2 (±0.07 W m−2) during the decade ending 2010. In addition to its focus on longwave radiation and the most influential forcing gas () only, this result is proportionally less than the TOA forcing due to its buffering by atmospheric absorption.

=== Basic estimates ===

Radiative forcing can be evaluated for its dependence on different factors which are external to the climate system. Basic estimates summarized in the following sections have been derived (assembled) in accordance with first principles of the physics of matter and energy. Forcings (ΔF) are expressed as changes over the total surface of the planet and over a specified time interval. Estimates may be significant in the context of global climate forcing for times spanning decades or longer. Gas forcing estimates presented in the IPCC&#x27;s AR6 report have been adjusted to include so-called &quot;fast&quot; feedbacks (positive or negative) which occur via atmospheric responses (i.e. &quot;effective radiative forcing&quot;).

== Forcing due to changes in atmospheric gases ==
For a well-mixed greenhouse gas, radiative transfer codes that examine each spectral line for atmospheric conditions can be used to calculate the forcing ΔF as a function of a change in its concentration. These calculations may be simplified into an algebraic formulation that is specific to that gas.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
A simplified first-order approximation expression for carbon dioxide () is:

: formula_6,

where &quot;C&quot;0 is a reference concentration in parts per million (ppm) by volume and &quot;ΔC&quot; is the concentration change in ppm. For the purpose of some studies (e.g. climate sensitivity), &quot;C&quot;0 is taken as the concentration prior to substantial anthropogenic changes and has a value of 278 ppm as estimated for the year 1750.
The atmospheric burden of greenhouse gases due to human activity has grown especially rapidly during the last several decades (since about year 1950). For carbon dioxide, the 50% increase (&quot;C/C0&quot; = 1.5) realized as of year 2020 since 1750 corresponds to a cumulative radiative forcing change (delta F) of +2.17 W/m2. Assuming no change in the emissions growth path, a doubling of concentrations (&quot;C/C0&quot; = 2) within the next several decades would correspond to a cumulative radiative forcing change (delta F) of +3.71 W/m2.

The relationship between and radiative forcing is logarithmic at concentrations up to around eight times the current value. Constant concentration increases thus have a progressively smaller warming effect. However, the first-order approximation is inaccurate at higher concentrations and there is no saturation in the absorption of infrared radiation by . Various mechanism behind the logarithmic scaling has been proposed but the spectrum distribution of the carbon dioxide seems to be essential, particularly a broadening in the relevant 15-&quot;μ&quot;m band coming from a Fermi resonance present in the molecule.

=== Other trace gases ===
Somewhat different formulae apply for other trace greenhouse gases such as methane and (square-root dependence) or CFCs (linear), with coefficients that may be found for example in the IPCC reports. A year 2016 study suggests a significant revision to the methane IPCC formula. Forcings by the most influential trace gases in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are included in the section describing recent growth trends, and in the IPCC list of greenhouse gases.

=== Water vapor ===
Water vapor is Earth&#x27;s primary greenhouse gas currently responsible for about half of all atmospheric gas forcing. Its overall atmospheric concentration depends almost entirely on the average planetary temperature, and has the potential to increase by as much as 7% with every degree (°C) of temperature rise (see also: Clausius–Clapeyron relation). Thus over long time scales, water vapor behaves as a system feedback that amplifies the radiative forcing driven by the growth of carbon dioxide and other trace gases.

== Forcing due to changes in solar irradiance ==
=== Variations in total solar irradiance (TSI) ===
The intensity of solar irradiance including all wavelengths is the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and on average is the solar constant. It is equal to about 1361 W m−2 at the distance of Earth&#x27;s annual-mean orbital radius of one astronomical unit and as measured at the top of the atmosphere. Earth TSI varies with both solar activity and planetary orbital dynamics. Multiple satellite-based instruments including ERB, ACRIM 1-3, VIRGO, and TIM have continuously measured TSI with improving accuracy and precision since 1978.

Approximating Earth as a sphere, the cross-sectional area exposed to the Sun (formula_7) is equal to one quarter the area of the planet&#x27;s surface (formula_8). The globally and annually averaged amount of solar irradiance per square meter of Earth&#x27;s atmospheric surface (formula_9) is therefore equal to one quarter of TSI, and has a nearly constant value of formula_10.

Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, so that the TSI received at any instant fluctuates between about 1321 W m−2 (at aphelion in early July) and 1412 W m−2 (at perihelion in early January), and thus by about ±3.4% over each year. This change in irradiance has minor influences on Earth&#x27;s seasonal weather patterns and its climate zones, which primarily result from the annual cycling in Earth&#x27;s relative tilt direction. Such repeating cycles contribute a net-zero forcing (by definition) in the context of decades-long climate changes.

=== Sunspot activity ===
Average annual TSI varies between about 1360 W m−2 and 1362 W m−2 (±0.05%) over the course of a typical 11-year sunspot activity cycle. Sunspot observations have been recorded since about year 1600 and show evidence of lengthier oscillations (Gleissberg cycle, Devries/Seuss cycle, etc.) which modulate the 11-year cycle (Schwabe cycle). Despite such complex behavior, the amplitude of the 11-year cycle has been the most prominent variation throughout this long-term observation record.

TSI variations associated with sunspots contribute a small but non-zero net forcing in the context of decadal climate changes. Some research suggests they may have partly influenced climate shifts during the Little Ice Age, along with concurrent changes in volcanic activity and deforestation. Since the late 20th century, average TSI has trended slightly lower along with a downward trend in sunspot activity.

=== Milankovitch shifts ===

Climate forcing caused by variations in solar irradiance have occurred during Milankovitch cycles, which span periods of about 40,000 to 100,000 years. Milankovitch cycles consist of long-duration cycles in Earth&#x27;s orbital eccentricity (or ellipticity), cycles in its orbital obliquity (or axial tilt), and precession of its relative tilt direction. Among these, the 100,000 year cycle in eccentricity causes TSI to fluctuate by about ±0.2%. Currently, Earth&#x27;s eccentricity is nearing its least elliptic (most circular) causing average annual TSI to very slowly decrease. Simulations also indicate that Earth&#x27;s orbital dynamics will remain stable including these variations for least the next 10 million years.

=== Sun aging ===

The Sun has consumed about half its hydrogen fuel since forming approximately 4.5 billion years ago. TSI will continue to slowly increase during the aging process at a rate of about 1% each 100 million years. Such rate of change is far too small to be detectable within measurements and is insignificant on human timescales.

=== Total solar irradiance (TSI) forcing summary ===

The maximum fractional variations (Δτ) in Earth&#x27;s solar irradiance during the last decade are summarized in the accompanying table. Each variation previously discussed contributes a forcing of: 
: formula_11,
where R=0.30 is Earth&#x27;s reflectivity. The radiative and climate forcings arising from changes in the Sun&#x27;s insolation are expected to continue to be minor, notwithstanding some as-of-yet undiscovered solar physics.

== Forcing due to changes in albedo and aerosols ==

=== Variations in Earth&#x27;s albedo ===
A fraction of incident solar radiation is reflected by clouds and aerosols, oceans and landforms, snow and ice, vegetation, and other natural and man-made surface features. The reflected fraction is known as Earth&#x27;s bond albedo (R), is evaluated at the top of the atmosphere, and has an average annual global value of about 0.30 (30%). The overall fraction of solar power absorbed by Earth is then (1−R) or 0.70 (70%).

Atmospheric components contribute about three-quarters of Earth albedo, and clouds alone are responsible for half. The major roles of clouds and water vapor are linked with the majority presence of liquid water covering the planet&#x27;s crust. Global patterns in cloud formation and circulation are highly complex, with couplings to ocean heat flows, and with jet streams assisting their rapid transport. Moreover, the albedos of Earth&#x27;s northern and southern hemispheres have been observed to be essentially equal (within 0.2%). This is noteworthy since more than two-thirds of land and 85% of the human population are in the north.

Multiple satellite-based instruments including MODIS, VIIRs, and CERES have continuously monitored Earth&#x27;s albedo since 1998. Landsat imagery, available since 1972, has also been used in some studies. Measurement accuracy has improved and results have converged in recent years, enabling more confident assessment of the recent decadal forcing influence of planetary albedo. Nevertheless, the existing data record is still too short to support longer-term predictions or to address other related questions.

Seasonal variations in planetary albedo can be understood as a set of system feedbacks that occur largely in response to the yearly cycling of Earth&#x27;s relative tilt direction. Along with the atmospheric responses, most apparent to surface dwellers are the changes in vegetation, snow, and sea-ice coverage. Intra-annual variations of about ±0.02 (± 7%) around Earth&#x27;s mean albedo have been observed throughout the course of a year, with maxima occurring twice per year near the time of each solar equinox. This repeating cycle contributes net-zero forcing in the context of decades-long climate changes.

=== Interannual variability ===

Regional albedos change from year to year due to shifts arising from natural processes, human actions, and system feedbacks. For example, human acts of deforestion typically raise Earth&#x27;s reflectivity while introducing water storage and irrigation to arid lands may lower it. Likewise considering feedbacks, ice loss in arctic regions decreases albedo while expanding desertification at low to middle latitudes increases it.

During years 2000-2012, no overall trend in Earth&#x27;s albedo was discernible within the 0.1% standard deviation of values measured by CERES. Along with the hemispherical equivalence, some researchers interpret the remarkably small interannual differences as evidence that planetary albedo may currently be constrained by the action of complex system feedbacks. Nevertheless, historical evidence also suggests that infrequent events such as major volcanic eruptions can significantly perturb the planetary albedo for several years or longer.

=== Albedo forcing summary ===
The measured fractional variations (Δ&quot;α&quot;) in Earth&#x27;s albedo during the first decade of the 21st century are summarized in the accompanying table. Similar to TSI, the radiative forcing due to a fractional change in planetary albedo (Δ&quot;α&quot;) is: 
: formula_12.
Satellite observations show that various Earth system feedbacks have stabilized planetary albedo despite recent natural and human-caused shifts. On longer timescales, it is more uncertain whether the net forcing which results from such external changes will remain minor.

== Recent growth trends ==

The IPCC summarized the current scientific consensus about radiative forcing changes as follows: &quot;Human-caused radiative forcing of 2.72 [1.96 to 3.48] W/m2 in 2019 relative to 1750 has warmed the climate system. This warming is mainly due to increased GHG concentrations, partly reduced by cooling due to increased aerosol concentrations&quot;.

Radiative forcing can be a useful way to compare the growing warming influence of different anthropogenic greenhouse gases over time.

The radiative forcing of long-lived and well-mixed greenhouse gases have been increasing in earth&#x27;s atmosphere since the industrial revolution. The table includes the direct forcing contributions from carbon dioxide (), methane (), nitrous oxide (); chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 12 and 11; and fifteen other halogenated gases. These data do not include the significant forcing contributions from shorter-lived and less-well-mixed gases or aerosols; including those indirect forcings from the decay of methane and some halogens. They also do not account for changes in land use or solar activity.



These data show that dominates the total forcing, with methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) becoming relatively smaller contributors to the total forcing over time. The five major greenhouse gases account for about 96% of the direct radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gas increases since 1750. The remaining 4% is contributed by the 15 minor halogenated gases.

It might be observed that the total forcing for year 2016, 3.027 W m−2, together with the commonly accepted value of climate sensitivity parameter λ, 0.8 K /(W m−2), results in an increase in global temperature of 2.4 K, much greater than the observed increase, about 1.2 K. Part of this difference is due to lag in the global temperature achieving steady state with the forcing. The remainder of the difference is due to negative aerosol forcing (compare climate effects of particulates), climate sensitivity being less than the commonly accepted value, or some combination thereof.

The table also includes an &quot;Annual Greenhouse Gas Index&quot; (AGGI), which is defined as the ratio of the total direct radiative forcing due to long-lived greenhouse gases for any year for which adequate global measurements exist to that which was present in 1990. 1990 was chosen because it is the baseline year for the Kyoto Protocol. This index is a measure of the inter-annual changes in conditions that affect carbon dioxide emission and uptake, methane and nitrous oxide sources and sinks, the decline in the atmospheric abundance of ozone-depleting chemicals related to the Montreal Protocol. and the increase in their substitutes (hydrogenated CFCs (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). Most of this increase is related to . For 2013, the AGGI was 1.34 (representing an increase in total direct radiative forcing of 34% since 1990). The increase in forcing alone since 1990 was about 46%. The decline in CFCs considerably tempered the increase in net radiative forcing.

An alternative table prepared for use in climate model intercomparisons conducted under the auspices of IPCC and including all forcings, not just those of greenhouse gases.

<text>The year 1687 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* The constellation &quot;Triangulum Minus&quot; is named by Johannes Hevelius.
==Biology==
* Alida Withoos at the house of Agnes Block makes a painting of the first pineapple bred in Europe.

==Medicine==
* Dutch physician Willem ten Rhijne publishes &quot;Verhandelinge van de Asiatise Melaatsheid na een naaukeuriger ondersoek ten dienste van het gemeen&quot; in Amsterdam, explaining Asian leprosy to the West.

==Physics==
* July 5 – Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, known as the &quot;Principia&quot;, is published by the Royal Society of London. In it, Newton describes his theory of universal gravitation, explains the laws of mechanics (including Newton&#x27;s laws of motion), gives a formula for the speed of sound and demonstrates that Earth is an oblate spheroid. The concepts in the &quot;Principia&quot; become the foundations of modern physics.
==Births==
* October 14 – Robert Simson, Scottish mathematician (died 1768).

<text>The Tom Green Show is a television show, created by and starring Canadian comedian Tom Green, that first aired in September 1994. The series aired on Rogers Television 22, a community channel in Ottawa, Ontario until 1996, when a single pilot episode was made for CBC Television. The Comedy Network greenlit the show in 1997 and aired it for 2 seasons from 1998 to 1999.

In January 1999, the show moved to the United States and aired on MTV. The series stopped production in March 2000, due to Green&#x27;s diagnosis of testicular cancer, but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. In 2002, it was ranked #41 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time. In 2003, the show was briefly revived as &quot;The New Tom Green Show&quot; with a more conventional late night talk show format. In 2006, Green launched &quot;Tom Green Live&quot;, a live call-in show for his website, which was later renamed &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot;.

==Synopsis==

===Personalities===
The show was hosted by Tom Green, along with longtime friends Glenn Humplik and Phil Giroux. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be embarrassed and not impressed by their son&#x27;s antics.

===Stunts===
Much of the show&#x27;s humor was Tom Green&#x27;s signature brand of shock comedy; numerous sketches featured Green performing bizarre or shocking acts in public, such as sucking on a cow&#x27;s udder, and throwing plastic baby dolls at passing cars. This content was highly controversial, and the show quickly garnered many detractors. Perhaps most controversial was Green&#x27;s treatment of his parents, who were often the targets of his pranks. In an infamous sketch, Green woke his parents in the middle of the night by placing a severed cow&#x27;s head in their bed, a reference to a similar scene in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. During an interview with his parents for their 30th anniversary, he turned the discussion into asking questions about their sex life.

Despite the show&#x27;s reputation for scatological and transgressive humor, several sketches featured Green performing in a responsible and respectful way, making fun of his juvenile persona. One of these sketches was &quot;People Helpers&quot;, where Green and guest star Bruce McCulloch seriously assisted wheelchair users.

One segment saw Green crash a press conference for &quot;Grey Owl&quot; featuring Pierce Brosnan and Richard Attenborough. Green proceeded to serenade Brosnan with a song referencing both &quot;Remington Steele&quot; and &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;. Brosnan, assuming Green was a journalist, advised Green not to give up his day job.

===Recurring characters and sketches===
The show also had a few recurring characters and sketches, including Billy Bob (a redneck who loved caramels and shaking his leg), Hockey Guy (a hockey player who would skate up in front of people and clumsily fall down), and a police station sketch.

He also explored the quirks of his friends. Green drew attention to Giroux&#x27;s unusual laugh and discomfort with the smell of copper. One sketch aired when Glen had to urinate, but couldn&#x27;t because Tom and the camera crew were in proximity (but still reasonably far away). They aired clips from a lengthy argument of whether a bear or a cougar would win in a fight.

===Tiger-Zebra===

Tiger-Zebra is a conceptual sketch and art piece featured in the show. It consists of a painting, called &quot;Tiger-Zebra&quot;, introduced, simply without any of the guards taking notice, to a local art gallery in a segment on the show. As the piece so was hanged on a wall in the gallery the painting is then interventioned, by Tom Green himself, inoff requests from some bystanders (gallery visitors); with a graffitti marker - seemingly adding a crude tree to it - while it is still being positioned on a wall at the current gallery exhibition.

===Cow Brain Boat===
In this the avant-garde sketch from the show Green is experimenting with (toy) models of boats and is swiftly seen in a toy store validating the models but eventually decides to go create his own boat from his own head. In the other scene Green could be seen with a sort of lexicon - which he briefly legislate for giving him the brand idea of a &quot;Cow Brain Boat&quot;. Green is then seen outside, with a handful of decapitated cow heads, being given the task to extract the brains from the cows. Green rightly does so and later apply the cow brains on a styrofoam base, further applying a sail on top, before he then position the boat in a lake and let it sail away. 

===Burning Feet Man===

Burning Feet Man is a surreal sketch and superhero being first conceptualized in a segment of the show. Though it is not clear exactly what good comes from the superhero - his powers can be simplified to be able to turn his boots on fire - without his fiery boots the hero seems out of &quot;duty&quot;.

===&quot;The Bum Bum Song&quot;===

When the show moved to MTV, Green released a single called Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song), encouraging visitors to download the song off his website, burn it onto CDs and distribute it to friends. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. He quickly called for the video to be retired because &quot;it&#x27;s not fair to 98 Degrees.&quot; Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that Total Request Live was, in fact, a live request show (the next week&#x27;s episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of &quot;The Bum Bum Song&quot; at the time).

===Special episodes===
In one episode that aired in early 2000, Green visited his parents in Ottawa, Ontario with Monica Lewinsky, and used the occasion to fool local reporters into thinking that they would make an important &quot;announcement&quot; together, which turned out to be related to Monica&#x27;s new interest in designing fabric handbags.

In 2000, Green made a one-hour special out of his testicular cancer surgery. It focused on his reaction to the cancer diagnosis, as well as his family&#x27;s, and footage of the actual surgery was included in one scene. The episode received wide critical acclaim for revealing a vulnerable, human side of an otherwise juvenile television personality.

In March 2002, he also starred in and directed a one-hour special called &quot;The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour&quot;, where he harassed strangers in Japan.

==&quot;The New Tom Green Show&quot;==
The show was briefly revived by MTV in 2003 as &quot;The New Tom Green Show&quot;, which was retooled to have a more standard late-night talk show format, but was cancelled by MTV a few months after its premiere due to plummeting ratings. The show ran for 51 episodes from June 23, 2003, to September 5, 2003. Its debut episode generated 871,000 viewers but the average viewership fell to 355,000 in September.

==&quot;Tom Green Live!&quot; / &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot;==
On June 15, 2006, Tom Green launched &quot;Tom Green Live!&quot;, a live call-in talk show broadcast on his website TomGreen.com. It began as a partnership between Green and ManiaTV!. In 2008, the show was renamed &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot;. The show takes place in Green&#x27;s own living room in the Hollywood Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley.

<doc id="467156" wikidata="Q1686042" url="?curid=467156" title="Unionist Party (Canada)">
<text>The Unionist Party was a centre to centre-right political party in Canada, composed primarily of former members of the Conservative party with some individual Liberal members of Parliament. It was formed in 1917 by MPs who supported the &quot;Union government&quot; formed by Sir Robert Borden during the First World War, who formed the government through the final years of the war, and was a proponent of conscription. It was opposed by the remaining Liberal MPs, who sat as the official opposition.

The Unionist Party continued to exist until 1922, at which time the Conservative elements re-formed the Conservative party.

== Formation ==

In May 1917, Conservative Prime Minister Borden proposed the formation of a national unity government or coalition government to Liberal leader Sir Wilfrid Laurier in order to enact conscription and to govern for the remainder of the war. Laurier rejected this proposal because of the opposition of his Quebec MPs and fears that Quebec nationalist leader Henri Bourassa would be able to exploit the situation. Public opinion in Quebec was heavily against conscription, influencing the Liberal opposition to it due to the large number of Liberal MPs from Quebec.

As an alternative to a coalition with Laurier, on October 12, 1917, Borden formed the Union government with a Cabinet of twelve Conservatives, nine Liberals and Independents, and one &quot;Labour&quot; member. To represent &quot;labor&quot; and the working class, Borden was appointed to the Cabinet Conservative Senator Gideon Decker Robertson who had been appointed to the Senate in January and had links with the conservative wing of the labor movement through his profession as a telegrapher. Robertson, however, was a Tory and not a member of any Labour or socialist party.

Borden then called an election for December 1917 on the issue of conscription (see also Conscription Crisis of 1917), running as head of the &quot;Unionist Party&quot; composed of Borden&#x27;s Conservatives, independent MPs, and members of the Liberals who left Laurier&#x27;s caucus to support conscription.

Supporters of the Borden government ran for parliament as &quot;Unionists&quot;, while some of the Liberals running as government supporters preferred to call themselves &quot;Liberal-Unionist&quot;. Prime Minister Borden pledged himself during the 1917 campaign to equal suffrage for women. He introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women; it passed without division.

This tactic split the Liberal Party: those who did not join the Unionist Party ran as Laurier Liberals. The election resulted in a landslide election victory for Borden.

Borden attempted to continue the Unionist Party after the war and when Arthur Meighen succeeded him in 1920, he renamed it the &quot;National Liberal and Conservative Party&quot; in the hope of making the coalition permanent. The Unionists had never been officially a single party, and therefore lacked the structure of an official party and Meighen hoped to change this.

In the 1921 general election, most of the Liberal-Unionist MPs did not join this party and ran as Liberals under the leadership of its new leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Only a handful ran again as Liberal-Unionists or joined Meighen&#x27;s renamed party. Prominent Liberal-Unionists who stayed with the Conservatives include Hugh Guthrie and Robert Manion.

Following the defeat of Meighen&#x27;s government, the &quot;National Liberal and Conservative Party&quot; changed its name to the &quot;Liberal-Conservative Party of Canada&quot;, although it was commonly known as the &quot;Conservative Party&quot;.

During World War II, the Conservatives opposed the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in the 1940 election by campaigning for a &quot;national government&quot; along the lines of the previous war&#x27;s Unionist government. Accordingly, Conservatives ran as National Government candidates. However, King&#x27;s Liberals won a landslide victory and continued to rule as an ordinary majority government throughout the war.

<doc id="467163" wikidata="Q7177251" url="?curid=467163" title="Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir Peter Wilfred Tapsell (21 January 1930 – 5 April 2012) was Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1993 to 1996. He was notable for being the first Māori Speaker, and for being the first Speaker since Bill Barnard in 1943 to hold office while not a member of the governing party.

He was an orthopaedic surgeon before entering politics.

==Early life==
Peter Wilfred Tapsell was born in 1930. His father Pita was a grandson of the early Danish-born trader Phillip Tapsell and Hine-i-tūrama Ngātiki.

Tapsell was born and raised in Rotorua, and went to Rotorua Boys&#x27; High School. With the help of a scholarship, he studied medicine at the University of Otago, graduating in 1952. 

He worked at several hospitals throughout New Zealand before travelling to the United Kingdom to undertake further study. Upon his return to New Zealand, he took up a position in Rotorua. Highly active in Māori cultural organisations, Tapsell was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to medicine and the Māori people.

==Member of Parliament==



Tapsell stood as the Labour Party candidate for Rotorua in the 1975 election and the 1978 election, but was not successful in entering Parliament until the 1981 election, when he stood as a candidate in the Eastern Maori electorate. In 1983 he was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Youth Affairs and Sport and Recreation by Labour leader David Lange.

===Cabinet Minister===
He was a minister in the Fourth Labour Government. At various stages of his parliamentary career, Tapsell served as Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister for the Arts, Minister of Police, Minister of Civil Defence, Minister of Science, Minister of Forestry, and Minister of Defence.

===Speaker of the House of Representatives===
After the 1993 election, the National Party had a majority of only one seat. The appointment of the Speaker, therefore, presented a problem – if National selected a Speaker from among its own ranks, as was traditional, it would lose its majority, since the Speaker was not permitted to vote at that time. Therefore, Prime Minister Jim Bolger decided to offer the Speaker&#x27;s position to a member of the Labour Party, thereby retaining the crucial vote. Tapsell was the person chosen by Bolger for this role.

Despite many objections from his Labour Party colleagues, Tapsell opted to accept the position. His elevation was not unchallenged, however, with an objection being raised by Winston Peters and his New Zealand First party. Peters claimed that his objection was on behalf of the incumbent Speaker, long-serving National MP Robin Gray, who had expected to resume his duties but was now being &quot;cast aside&quot; for political reasons. Critics of Peters, however, claimed that New Zealand First merely wanted to leave National and Labour deadlocked, as it would be New Zealand First that held the balance of power in that situation. Robin Gray, however, refused the nomination, and Tapsell took the Speaker&#x27;s chair unopposed.

== Retirement ==

In the 1996 election, however, Tapsell lost the electorate, now called Te Tai Rawhiti, by 4215 votes to New Zealand First&#x27;s Tuariki Delamere, one of the &quot;Tight Five&quot;. Tapsell had not been put on the party list. This was part of a major shift away from the Labour Party by Māori voters, with New Zealand First capturing all of the Māori electorates. Whether Tapsell would have retained the Speaker&#x27;s role is uncertain, as a reform of Parliamentary procedure meant the Speaker no longer lost their vote. The loss of his electorate seat, however, prompted Tapsell&#x27;s retirement from politics.

In 1991, Tapsell&#x27;s family was struck with tragedy when his daughter killed his mother. In the subsequent trial, she was judged not guilty by reason of insanity.

In the 1997 New Year Honours, Tapsell was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services, lately as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

After his retirement, Tapsell was involved in a number of organisations, becoming the Patron of Monarchy New Zealand. He also assisted several medical charities, and the University of Waikato awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1997. In 2006, Tapsell spoke at an event with Hak Ja Han, wife of Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon, and praised their teaching of a &quot;concept of the ideal family as comprising a father, a mother, children and grandparents&quot; living together in a three generation extended family, as being &quot;very Māori.&quot;

<doc id="467164" wikidata="Q9810870" url="?curid=467164" title="Bacteroidota">
<text>The phylum Bacteroidota (synonym Bacteroidetes) is composed of three large classes of Gram-negative, nonsporeforming, anaerobic or aerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment, including in soil, sediments, and sea water, as well as in the guts and on the skin of animals.

Although some &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. can be opportunistic pathogens, many &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; are symbiotic species highly adjusted to the gastrointestinal tract. &quot;Bacteroides&quot; are highly abundant in intestines, reaching up to 1011 cells g−1 of intestinal material. They perform metabolic conversions that are essential for the host, such as degradation of proteins or complex sugar polymers. &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; colonize the gastrointestinal tract already in infants, as non-digestible oligosaccharides in mother milk support the growth of both &quot;Bacteroides&quot; and &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; spp. &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. are selectively recognized by the immune system of the host through specific interactions.

== History ==
&quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot; was the first &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species isolated in 1898 as a human pathogen linked to appendicitis among other clinical cases. By far, the species in the class &quot;Bacteroidia&quot; are the most well-studied, including the genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot; (an abundant organism in the feces of warm-blooded animals including humans), and &quot;Porphyromonas&quot;, a group of organisms inhabiting the human oral cavity. The class &quot;Bacteroidia&quot; was formerly called &quot;Bacteroidetes&quot;; as it was until recently the only class in the phylum, the name was changed in the of Bergey&#x27;s &quot;Manual of Systematic Bacteriology&quot;.

For a long time, it was thought that the majority of Gram-negative gastrointestinal tract bacteria belonged to the genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, but in recent years many species of &quot;Bacteroides&quot; have undergone reclassification. Based on current classification, the majority of the gastrointestinal &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species belong to the families &quot;Bacteroidaceae&quot;, &quot;Prevotellaceae&quot;, &quot;Rikenellaceae&quot;, and &quot;Porphyromonadaceae&quot;.  
This phylum is sometimes grouped with &quot;Chlorobiota&quot;, &quot;Fibrobacterota&quot;, &quot;Gemmatimonadota&quot;, &quot;Calditrichota&quot;, and marine group A to form the FCB group or superphylum. In the alternative classification system proposed by Cavalier-Smith, this taxon is instead a class in the phylum Sphingobacteria.

== Medical and ecological role ==
In the gastrointestinal microbiota &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; have a very broad metabolic potential and are regarded as one of the most stable part of gastrointestinal microflora. Reduced abundance of the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; in some cases is associated with obesity. This bacterial group as a whole has conflicting evidence for alteration of abundance in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, though its genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot; is likely enriched, but it may be involved in type 1 and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. in contrast to &quot;Prevotella&quot; spp. were recently found to be enriched in the metagenomes of subjects with low gene richness that were associated with adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia as well as an inflammatory phenotype. &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species that belong to classes &quot;Flavobacteriales&quot; and &quot;Sphingobacteriales&quot; are typical soil bacteria and are only occasionally detected in the gastrointestinal tract, except &quot;Capnocytophaga spp.&quot; and &quot;Sphingobacterium spp.&quot; that can be detected in the human oral cavity.

&quot;Bacteroidota&quot; are not limited to gut microbiota, they colonize a variety of habitats on Earth. For example, &quot;Bacteroidota&quot;, together with &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot;, &quot;Bacillota&quot;, and &quot;Actinomycetota&quot;, are also among the most abundant bacterial groups in rhizosphere. They have been detected in soil samples from various locations, including cultivated fields, greenhouse soils and unexploited areas. &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; also inhabit freshwater lakes, rivers, as well as oceans. They are increasingly recognized as an important compartment of the bacterioplankton in marine environments, especially in pelagic oceans. Halophilic &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; genus &quot;Salinibacter&quot; inhabit hypersaline environments such as salt-saturated brines in hypersaline lakes. &quot;Salinibacter&quot;  shares many properties with halophilic &quot;Archaea&quot; such as &quot;Halobacterium&quot; and &quot;Haloquadratum&quot; that inhabit the same environments. Phenotypically, &quot;Salinibacter&quot; is remarkably similar to &quot;Halobacterium&quot; and therefore for a long time remained unidentified.

== Metabolism ==
Gastrointestinal &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species produce succinic acid, acetic acid, and in some cases propionic acid, as the major end-products. Species belonging to the genera &quot;Alistipes&quot;, &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, &quot;Parabacteroides&quot;, &quot;Prevotella&quot;, &quot;Paraprevotella&quot;, &quot;Alloprevotella&quot;, &quot;Barnesiella&quot;, and &quot;Tannerella&quot; are saccharolytic, while species belonging to &quot;Odoribacter&quot; and &quot;Porphyromonas&quot; are predominantly asaccharolytic. Some &quot;Bacteroides spp.&quot; and &quot;Prevotella spp.&quot; can degrade complex plant polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, xylans, and pectins. The &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species also play an important role in protein metabolism by proteolytic activity assigned to the proteases linked to the cell. Some &quot;&quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. have a potential to utilize urea as a nitrogen source. Other important functions of &quot;Bacteroides&quot; spp. include the deconjugation of bile acids and growth on mucus. Many members of the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; genera (&quot;Flexibacter&quot;, &quot;Cytophaga&quot;, &quot;Sporocytophaga&quot; and relatives) are coloured yellow-orange to pink-red due to the presence of pigments of the flexirubin group. In some &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; strains, flexirubins may be present together with carotenoid pigments. Carotenoid pigments are usually found in marine and halophilic members of the group, whereas flexirubin pigments are more frequent in clinical, freshwater or soil-colonizing representatives.

==Genomics==
Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 27 proteins which are present in most species of the phylum &quot;Bacteroidota&quot;. Of these, one protein is found in all sequenced &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species, while two other proteins are found in all sequenced species with the exception of those from the genus &quot;Bacteroides&quot;. The absence of these two proteins in this genus is likely due to selective gene loss. Additionally, four proteins have been identified which are present in all &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; species except &quot;Cytophaga hutchinsonii&quot;; this is again likely due to selective gene loss. A further eight proteins have been identified which are present in all sequenced &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; genomes except &quot;Salinibacter ruber&quot;. The absence of these proteins may be due to selective gene loss, or because &quot;S. ruber&quot; branches very deeply, the genes for these proteins may have evolved after the divergence of &quot;S. ruber&quot;. A conserved signature indel has also been identified; this three-amino-acid deletion in ClpB chaperone is present in all species of the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; phylum except &quot;S. ruber&quot;. This deletion is also found in one &quot;Chlorobiota&quot; species and one &quot;Archaeum&quot; species, which is likely due to horizontal gene transfer. These 27 proteins and the three-amino-acid deletion serve as molecular markers for the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot;.

===Relatedness of &quot;Bacteroidota&quot;, &quot;Chlorobiota&quot;, and &quot;Fibrobacterota&quot; phyla===
Species from the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; and &quot;Chlorobiota&quot; phyla branch very closely together in phylogenetic trees, indicating a close relationship. Through the use of comparative genomic analysis, three proteins have been identified which are uniquely shared by virtually all members of the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; and &quot;Chlorobiota&quot; phyla. The sharing of these three proteins is significant because other than them, no proteins from either the &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; or &quot;Chlorobiota&quot; phyla are shared by any other groups of bacteria. Several conserved signature indels have also been identified which are uniquely shared by members of the phyla. The presence of these molecular signatures supports their close relationship. Additionally, the phylum &quot;Fibrobacterota&quot; is indicated to be specifically related to these two phyla. A clade consisting of these three phyla is strongly supported by phylogenetic analyses based upon a number of different proteins These phyla also branch in the same position based upon conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins. Lastly and most importantly, two conserved signature indels (in the RpoC protein and in serine hydroxymethyltransferase) and one signature protein PG00081 have been identified that are uniquely shared by all of the species from these three phyla. All of these results provide compelling evidence that the species from these three phyla shared a common ancestor exclusive of all other bacteria, and it has been proposed that they should all recognized as part of a single &quot;FCB&quot; superphylum.

<text>John Dyer (1699 – 15 December 1757) was a painter and Welsh poet who became a priest in the Church of England. He was most recognised for &quot;Grongar Hill&quot;, one of six early poems featured in a 1726 miscellany. Longer works published later include the less successful genre poems, &quot;The Ruins of Rome&quot; (1740) and &quot;The Fleece&quot; (1757). His work has always been more anthologised than published in separate editions, but his talent was later recognised by William Wordsworth among others.

==Life and career==

===Youth===
John Dyer was the fourth of six children born to Robert and Catherine Cocks Dyer in Llanfynydd, Carmarthenshire, five miles from Grongar Hill. His exact birth date is unknown, but the earliest existing record of John Dyer dates his baptism on 13 August 1699 – within fourteen days after his birth as was the tradition of the time – in Llanfynnydd parish. His grandfather was churchwarden there and his father was a highly successful solicitor in Llanfynnydd and owned several properties in the neighbourhood. Presumably for financial opportunity and greater living space for six children, the family moved in 1710 to the mansion of Aberglasney in the nearby parish of Llangathen.

Dyer was first educated in an unknown school in the countryside before attending Westminster School under Dr. Robert Freind. Dyer&#x27;s dislike for Westminster was chronicled in a 1714 entry in his &quot;Journal of Escapes&quot;: &quot;Ran from school and my father, on a box of the ear being given me strolled for three or four days – found at Windsor.&quot; He retained little of what he learned, as evidenced later by his unfamiliarity with the Latin authors that were a school staple.
After Westminster School, Dyer worked in his father&#x27;s office, learning the business. His talent in the field of law was evidenced by the lawsuits in which he was involved and he was the only one of four sons to have managed his property well. John&#x27;s father, who wanted his son to pursue a career as solicitor, subdued the poet&#x27;s longing to channel his creativity through painting and writing. Ralph M. Williams comments that it was upon his return to Aberglasney &quot;that we first begin to know something of his personality and see for the first time the conflict in him between the dreamy romantic and the practical man of business that runs through his life.&quot; Having grown up among the ancient stoneworks in the Aberglasney grounds, it was not surprising that Dyer had developed an interest in antiquities and the love of nature that characterises his work.

Robert Dyer&#x27;s death on 8 July 1720 ended John&#x27;s apprenticeship to the law and he was not named in his father&#x27;s will, releasing him from handling the lawsuit riddled estate bequeathed to his brother, also called Robert. John then left Aberglasney for London in 1720 or 1721 to pursue painting and poetry.

===Painting and poetry===
In London, Dyer apprenticed himself under the artist Jonathan Richardson. Richardson&#x27;s fundamental principle of painting was that all aspects of learning, from reading, observation of nature, studying works by masters in painting and writing poetry were necessary to provide artists with inspiration. As a result, Dyer retained such interests and translated his studies into verbal landscape art. His first attempt in writing Miltonic octosyllabic couplets was addressed to his mentor, &quot;An Epistle to a Famous Painter&quot;, the same measure as in his second version of &quot;Grongar Hill&quot;. It was under Richardson that Dyer met his coffee house group of friends, Thomas Edwards, Daniel Wray, George Knapton and Arthur Pond. Pond would later be referred to in &quot;The Fleece&quot; (IV. 265).

Dyer, with Richardson&#x27;s blessing, sailed to Italy in 1724 to continue his studies and made his way straight to Rome, where he admired its objects of antiquity. The Pantheon was a favourite building and preoccupied his time during the trip, while the Colosseum and the Baths of Caracalla were also held in high regard. Among sculptures and reliefs, he notes the Hercules, the Apollo, the &quot;Venus de Medici,&quot; the Laocoön group, Trajan&#x27;s column, the temple of Pallas, the arches of Titus and Constantine and the Borghese Dancers (now in the Louvre). Such were the inspirations or objects of interest in Dyer&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ruins of Rome&quot;, written in 1740. But though he appreciated the beauties about him, his staunch Protestantism was appalled by what he regarded as the superstitious practices of Catholicism: &quot;God of our Fathers, keep us from the ways of these foul hirelings,&quot; he exclaimed in a poetic fragment written at the time.
While there, Dyer fell ill with a malarial fever caught in the Campagna and began to contemplate his future. Resuming his journey northwards, he visited the ruins of Otricoli, where he found inspiration for his poem signifying this shift of mood, &quot;Written at Ocriculum in Italy, 1725&quot;. Continuing on his journey to Florence, his visits to museums and buildings there instigated a shift in his interests from the classical to the Renaissance period to create one of his few surviving paintings, a copy of Antonio da Correggio&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Madonna Adoring the Christ Child.&quot;

On Dyer&#x27;s return, a selection of six of his poems were published in Richard Savage&#x27;s &quot;Miscellaneous Poems and Translations&quot; (1726), which largely consisted of the work of the coterie that had gathered about Aaron Hill, one of those literary groupings typical of the 18th century whose work interconnected and was often cross-referential. This was evident in the many &#x27;collected&#x27; editions of Dyer&#x27;s poems published after his death that were prefaced by poems addressed to him by these friends, in answer to or answered by the shorter poems of Dyer&#x27;s placed at the end. Thus Dyer&#x27;s poem &quot;To Mr Savage, son of the late Earl Rivers&quot;, exhorting him to bear up under misfortune, is answered by Savage&#x27;s &quot;An epistle to My John Dyer in answer to his from the country&quot;. And Dyer&#x27;s paean to living in country obscurity, &quot;To a friend in town&quot;, becomes a Horatian exchange when complemented by Aaron Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Choice&quot;.
Another cluster of poems about Dyer&#x27;s portrait of Martha Fowke, who went under the name of Clio in the group, is particularly rich. Both Dyer&#x27;s &quot;A Country Walk&quot; and &quot;The Inquiry&quot; mention her with singular devotion. So also does &quot;To Clio from Rome&quot; (which remained uncollected in 18th century editions) with its reference to &quot;the wreathed urn among the vines, whose form my pencil now designs.&quot; This comes aptly, since Dyer had recently painted her. Martha&#x27;s reply apologises for her tardiness and compliments both his poetic and artistic tributes: &quot;Your claim demands the bays in double wreath, Your poems lighten and your pictures breathe&quot;. Savage too paid his tribute &quot;To Mr John Dyer, occasioned by seeing his picture of the celebrated Clio&quot; in which, going beyond outward likeness, &quot;You eye the Soul&quot;. The most that Dyer himself will admit in his epistle &quot;To a Famous Painter&quot; (his teacher Jonathan Richardson), also written from Rome, is the modest confession that &quot;As yet I but in verse can paint&quot;.

Several later poems that only exist in manuscript were addressed to different ladies. His epistle &quot;To Aurelia&quot;, another member of the coterie, is an appeal to &quot;leave the smoky Town&quot; with him for some rural retreat. Other poems cover pseudonymous flirtations with a Myra and a Celia.

===Later life===
Following his return to England after a year and half in Italy, and then the publication of his early poems in 1726, Dyer briefly returned to Aberglasney, where he became estranged from his brother Robert. The next several years were spent between London and Herefordshire or on painting trips. In 1734 he restored to profitability a rundown farm belonging to an aunt and spent several more years as a gentleman farmer in other counties. It was at this period too that Dyer began writing again. From then dates the anecdotal pastoral &quot;My Ox Duke&quot;. He was also on the lookout for a suitable subject for a longer poem and began work on the unfinished fragment &quot;The Cambro-Briton&quot;. Eventually, however, he fell back on the fruits of his Italian travels, published as &quot;The Ruins of Rome&quot; in 1740. It was only much later in his georgic &quot;The Fleece&quot; (1757) that he put to use the insight into the wool industry that he gained as a farmer.

The master theme of &quot;The Ruins of Rome&quot; had already suggested itself to Dyer in his earlier &quot;Written at Ocriculum in Italy, 1725&quot;. Written in a mannered imitation of Miltonic blank verse, it opens with Dyer painting among the ruins, &quot;studious to excel, of praise and fame ambitious&quot;. As night falls, a seer comes to remind him of his mortality by pointing to the downfallen architecture of the past. Instead he is exhorted to learn from the work of the eternal Creator spread in beauty across the skies and dedicate his life to goodness. The poem&#x27;s religious conclusions were also to find expression in two unpublished poems of the 1750s, &quot;A Night Prospect written on Lincoln Heath&quot; and &quot;On the Destruction of Lisbon&quot;.

Little is known about his paintings all this time, for most have been lost. Apart from family portraits attributed to him, two others on religious subjects are reported. One was a &quot;Last Supper&quot; at Newtown Church, the other a head of Christ owned by another family member. In 1741 Dyer travelled to Worcester to paint the portrait of Bishop John Hough and while there was persuaded to seek ordination in the Church of England. In September of that year he was created a deacon and by October was made priest of Catthorpe in Leicestershire, a position he held for the next nine years.

Now Dyer married a 26-year-old widow, Sarah Ensor Hawkins (said to be a descendant of Shakespeare), with whom he had several children. In 1751 patrons found him a more prosperous living in Belchford, Lincolnshire, and in the following year he ministered to Coningsby as well, later still moving to Kirkby on Bain, also in Lincolnshire. In 1752 he had been made a Bachelor of Laws of Cambridge and by now had begun writing &quot;The Fleece&quot;, on the title page of which the initials LL.B followed his name.

Living in the Lincolnshire fens, &quot;among reeds and mud, begirt with dead brown lakes&quot;, as he reported in verses sent to a friend, proved fatal to Dyer&#x27;s tubercular condition. Some months after the publication of his final poem, he died in December 1757. His major poems were published by Robert Dodsley in 1761, followed later by wider selections that included his earlier poems from Savage&#x27;s miscellany. The contents of these varied little, until the appearance of &quot;The Poems of Mark Akenside and John Dyer&quot;, This included manuscript poems in the possession of a family descendant, William Hilton Longstaffe, who had earlier written a commentary on some of these in &quot;The Patrician&quot;. Edward Thomas brought out a shorter selection in 1903 for the Welsh Library and there have been American studies of his poetry since then.

==Poems==
Among Dyer&#x27;s papers is a transcription that he describes as &quot;P&#x27;t of Gron&#x27;. Hill as &#x27;twas wrote first in ye year 1716&quot;. It is a discursive work in decasyllabic couplets with little relation to the &quot;Grongar Hill&quot; published a decade later and might just as well have served as the basis of &quot;The Country Walk&quot;. The first published version of his celebration of the hill was written in Pindarics and originally appeared in Richard Savage&#x27;s miscellany. In the same year, after having received some acclaim, Dyer rewrote &quot;Grongar Hill&quot; in four-stressed octosyllabic couplets roughly modelled on those of Milton&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot; and contrasting strongly with the version of pastoral in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Windsor Forest&quot;. Though the rhymes and grammar are uncertain, the poem was eventually to be accounted his best work and was recognised as a precursor of Romanticism. Dyer worked outside the trend of politically oriented work and kept his focus on the rural landscape, its colours and visual perspective, following his training as a painter.

&quot;The Ruins of Rome&quot; was a descriptive poem in 545 lines of Miltonic blank-verse. Though it was first published anonymously in 1740, its reference to the earlier &quot;Grongar&quot; in its opening lines establishes Dyer&#x27;s authorship.
&lt;poem&gt;::Enough of Grongar, and the shady dales
::Of winding Towy, Merlin&#x27;s fabled haunt,
::I sung inglorious. Now the love of arts,
::And what in metal or in stone remains
::Of proud Antiquity, thro&#x27; various realms ⁠
::And various languages and ages fam&#x27;d,
::Bears me remote o&#x27;er Gallia&#x27;s woody bounds.&lt;/poem&gt;
As in that earlier poem, Dyer&#x27;s approach to antiquity is personalised and a forerunner of the &quot;Age of Sensibility&quot; that led poetry in the direction of Romanticism. The poem has been described as &quot;largely responsible for the eighteenth-century revival of a unique subgenre of landscape poetry dealing with the ruins of the ancient world.&quot;

The ambitious four-book &quot;The Fleece&quot; (1757), was also written in blank-verse. It was a georgic in the line of Virgilian imitations written during the 18th century that included John Philips&#x27; &quot;Cyder&quot;, Christopher Smart&#x27;s &quot;The Hop-Garden&quot; (1752) and James Grainger&#x27;s &quot;The Sugar Cane&quot; (1764). Dyer&#x27;s poem deals with the tending of sheep, the shearing and preparation of the wool, weaving, and trade in wollen manufactures. Its lofty epic diction also addresses the reasons for England&#x27;s prosperity and on a personal level reflects on the benefits that trade will bring to him. Poetic recognition, however, was not among such benefits at the time, although the work had its supporters, including Grainger, one of the few who reviewed Dyer&#x27;s poem sympathetically. In the following century William Wordsworth was to address a sonnet to Dyer as the 
:Bard of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made
:That work a living landscape fair and bright.

* October 18 – Fermat states his &quot;little theorem&quot; in a letter to Frénicle de Bessy: if &quot;p&quot; is a prime number, then for any integer &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; &quot;p&quot; − &quot;a&quot; will be divisible by &quot;p&quot;.
* December 25 – Fermat claims a proof of the theorem on sums of two squares in a letter to Mersenne (&quot;Fermat&#x27;s Christmas Theorem&quot;): an odd prime &quot;p&quot; is expressible as the sum of two squares.

==Technology==
* The micrometer is developed.
* A form of bayonet is invented; in later years it will gradually replace the pike.
* The reticle telescope is developed and initiates the birth of sharpshooting.

==Births==
* April 1 – Georg Mohr, Danish mathematician (died 1697)
* December 13 (&quot;bapt.&quot;) – Robert Plot, English naturalist and chemist and illustrator of the first dinosaur fossil (died 1696)
* Elias Tillandz, Swedish physician and botanist in Finland (died 1693)

==Deaths==
* December 22 – Jean de Beaugrand, French mathematician (born c. 1584)

<doc id="467180" wikidata="Q7776980" url="?curid=467180" title="The dismal science">
<text>The dismal science is a derogatory term for the discipline of economics. Thomas Carlyle used the phrase in his 1849 essay &quot;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&quot; in contrast with the then-familiar phrase &quot;gay science&quot; used to refer to the art of troubadours.

==Origin==

The phrase &quot;the dismal science&quot; first occurs in Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s 1849 tract, &quot;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&quot;, in which he argued in favor of reintroducing slavery in order to restore productivity to the West Indies: &quot;Not a &#x27;gay science&#x27;, I should say, like some we have heard of; no, a dreary, desolate and, indeed, quite abject and distressing one; what we might call, by way of eminence, the &quot;dismal science&quot;.&quot;

Economics was &quot;dismal&quot; in &quot;find[ing] the secret of this Universe in &#x27;supply and demand&#x27;, and reducing the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone&quot; or personal freedom. Instead, the &quot;idle black man in the West Indies&quot; should be &quot;&quot;compelled&quot; to work as he was fit, and to &quot;do&quot; the Maker&#x27;s will who had constructed him&quot;. Carlyle also extended this imperative to other races.

Carlyle did not originally coin the phrase &quot;dismal science&quot; as a response to the economically influential theories of Thomas Malthus, who predicted that starvation would inevitably result as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, Carlyle used the word &quot;dismal&quot; in relation to Malthus&#x27; theory in &quot;Chartism&quot; (1839):

Carlyle&#x27;s view was criticised by John Stuart Mill as making a virtue of toil itself, stunting the development of the weak, and committing the &quot;vulgar error of imputing every difference which he finds among human beings to an original difference of nature&quot;.

Amongst those who were influenced by Carlyle&#x27;s assessment was John Ruskin, who wrote that Carlyle had &quot;led the way&quot; for his own critique of political economy in &quot;Unto This Last&quot; (1860).

==Beyond Carlyle==
Many at the time and afterward have understood the phrase in relation to the grim predictions drawn from the principles of 19th century political economy. According to Humphry House:

(Ricardo, however, did not believe that wages must always fall to the minimum. He believed that they were a function of the margin of production.)

In modern terms, the phrase is sometimes referenced by synonymous terms like &quot;the miserable science&quot;, as shown in this quote by E. W. Dijkstra: &quot;As economics is known as &#x27;The Miserable Science&#x27;, software engineering should be known as &#x27;The Doomed Discipline&#x27;&quot;.

In modern discourse, the term can refer to the fact that economics invariably involves the study of scarcity, conflict, and trade-offs, leading to conclusions and policy recommendations that may highlight limitations and negative aspects of human behavior and societal organization.

*Malthusianism – political (and economic) fallout from the theory

<text>Wide-bandgap semiconductors (also known as WBG semiconductors or WBGSs) are semiconductor materials which have a larger band gap than conventional semiconductors. Conventional semiconductors like silicon and selenium have a bandgap in the range of 0.7 – 1.5 electronvolt (eV), whereas wide-bandgap materials have bandgaps in the range above 2 eV. Generally, wide-bandgap semiconductors have electronic properties which fall in between those of conventional semiconductors and insulators.

Wide-bandgap semiconductors permit devices to operate at much higher voltages, frequencies, and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials like silicon and gallium arsenide. They are the key component used to make short-wavelength (green-UV) LEDs or lasers, and are also used in certain radio frequency applications, notably military radars. Their intrinsic qualities make them suitable for a wide range of other applications, and they are one of the leading contenders for next-generation devices for general semiconductor use.

The wider bandgap is particularly important for allowing devices that use them to operate at much higher temperatures, on the order of 300 °C. This makes them highly attractive for military applications, where they have seen a fair amount of use. The high temperature tolerance also means that these devices can be operated at much higher power levels under normal conditions. Additionally, most wide-bandgap materials also have a much higher critical electrical field density, on the order of ten times that of conventional semiconductors. Combined, these properties allow them to operate at much higher voltages and currents, which makes them highly valuable in military, radio, and power conversion applications. The US Department of Energy believes they will be a foundational technology in new electrical grid and alternative energy devices, as well as the robust and efficient power components used in high-power vehicles from plug-in electric vehicles to electric trains. Most wide-bandgap materials also have high free-electron velocities, which allows them to work at higher switching speeds, which adds to their value in radio applications. A single WBG device can be used to make a complete radio system, eliminating the need for separate signal and radio-frequency components, while operating at higher frequencies and power levels.

Research and development of wide-bandgap materials lags behind that of conventional semiconductors, which have received massive investment since the 1970s. However, their clear inherent advantages in many applications, combined with some unique properties not found in conventional semiconductors, has led to increasing interest in their use in everyday electronic devices instead of silicon. Their ability to handle higher power density is particularly attractive for attempts to sustain Moore&#x27;s law – the observed steady rate of increase in the density of transistors on an integrated circuit, which has, over decades, doubled roughly every two years. Conventional technologies, however, appear to be reaching a plateau of transistor density.

==Use in devices==
Wide-bandgap materials have several characteristics that make them useful compared to narrower bandgap materials. The higher energy gap gives devices the ability to operate at higher temperatures, as bandgaps typically shrink with increasing temperature, which can be problematic when using conventional semiconductors. For some applications, wide-bandgap materials allow devices to switch larger voltages. The wide bandgap also brings the electronic transition energy into the range of the energy of visible light, and hence light-emitting devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and semiconductor lasers can be made that emit in the visible spectrum, or even produce ultraviolet radiation.

Solid-state lighting using wide-bandgap semiconductors has the potential to reduce the amount of energy required to provide lighting compared with incandescent lights, which have a luminous efficacy of less than 20 lumens per watt. The efficacy of LEDs is on the order of 160 lumens per watt.

Wide-bandgap semiconductors can also be used in RF signal processing. Silicon-based power transistors are reaching limits of operating frequency, breakdown voltage, and power density. Wide-bandgap materials can be used in high-temperature and power switching applications.

==Materials==
- The only wide bandgap materials in group IV are diamond and silicon carbide (SiC).

- The only semiconducting material in group III is Boron, with a wider bandgap than Silicon, Selenium, and Germanium.

There are many III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors with wide bandgaps. In the III-V semiconductor family, aluminium nitride (AlN) is used to fabricate ultraviolet LEDs with wavelengths down to 200–250 nm, gallium nitride (GaN) is used to make blue LEDs and laser diodes, and boron nitride (BN) is proposed for blue LEDs.

==Materials properties==

===Bandgap===

Quantum mechanics gives rise to a series of distinct electron energy levels, or &quot;bands&quot;, that vary from material to material. Each band can hold a certain number of electrons; if the atom has more electrons then they are forced into higher energy bands. In the presence of external energy, some of the electrons will gain energy and move back up the energy bands, before releasing it and falling back down to a lower band. With the constant application of external energy, like the thermal energy present at room temperature, an equilibrium is reached where the population of electrons moving up and down the bands is equal.

Depending on the distribution of the energy bands, and the &quot;band gap&quot; between them, the materials will have very different electrical properties. For instance, at room temperature most metals have a series of partially filled bands that allow electrons to be added or removed with little applied energy. When tightly packed together, electrons can easily move from atom to atom, making them excellent conductors. In comparison, most plastic materials have widely spaced energy levels that require considerable energy to move electrons between their atoms, making them natural insulators. Semiconductors are those materials that have both types of bands, and at normal operational temperatures, some electrons are in both bands.

In semiconductors, adding a small amount of energy pushes more electrons into the &quot;conduction band&quot;, making them more conductive and allowing current to flow like a conductor. Reversing the polarity of this applied energy pushes the electrons into the more widely separated bands, making them insulators and stopping the flow. Since the amount of energy needed to push the electrons between these two levels is very small, semiconductors allow switching with very little energy input. However, this switching process depends on the electrons being naturally distributed between the two states, so small inputs cause the population statistics to change rapidly. As the external temperature changes, due to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, more and more electrons will normally find themselves in one state or the other, causing the switching action to occur on its own, or stop entirely.

The size of the atoms and the number of protons in the atom are the primary predictors of the strength and layout of the bandgaps. Materials with small atoms and strong atomic bonds are associated with wide bandgaps. With regard to III-V compounds, nitrides are associated with the largest bandgaps. Bandgaps can be engineered by alloying, and Vegard&#x27;s law states that there is a linear relation between lattice constant and composition of a solid solution at constant temperature. The position of the conduction band minima versus maxima in the band structure determine whether a bandgap is direct or indirect, where direct bandgap materials absorb light strongly, and indirect bandgaps absorb less strongly. Likewise, direct bandgap material emit light strongly, while indirect bandgap semiconductor are poor light emitters, unless dopants are added which couple strongly to light.

===Optical properties===

The connection between the wavelength and the bandgap is that the energy of the bandgap is the minimum energy that is needed to excite an electron into the conduction band. In order for an unassisted photon to cause this excitation, it must have at least that much energy. In the opposite process, when excited electron-hole pairs undergo recombination, photons are generated with energies that correspond to the magnitude of the bandgap.

The bandgap determines the wavelength at which LEDs emit light and the wavelength at which photovoltaics operate most efficiently. Wide-bandgap devices therefore are useful at shorter wavelengths than other semiconductor devices. The bandgap for GaAs of 1.4 eV, for example, corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 890 nm, which is infrared light (the equivalent wavelength for light energy can be determined by dividing the constant 1240 nm-eV by the energy in eV, so 1240 nm-eV/1.4 eV=886 nm). 
Since the highest efficiency would be produced from a photovoltaic cell with layers tuned to the different regions of the solar spectrum, modern multi-junction solar cells have multiple layers with different bandgaps, and wide-bandgap semiconductors are a key component for collecting the part of the spectrum beyond the infrared.

The use of LEDs in lighting applications depends particularly on the development of wide-bandgap nitride semiconductors.

===Breakdown field===
Impact ionization is often attributed to be the cause of breakdown. At the point of breakdown, electrons in a semiconductor are associated with sufficient kinetic energy to produce carriers when they collide with lattice atoms.

Wide-bandgap semiconductors are associated with a high breakdown voltage. This is due to a larger electric field required to generate carriers through impact.

At high electric fields, drift velocity saturates due to scattering from optical phonons. A higher optical phonon energy results in fewer optical phonons at a particular temperature, and there are therefore fewer scattering centers, and electrons in wide-bandgap semiconductors can achieve high peak velocities.

The drift velocity reaches a peak at an intermediate electric field and undergoes a small drop at higher fields. Intervalley scattering is an additional scattering mechanism at large electric fields, and it is due to a shift of carriers from the lowest valley of the conduction band to the upper valleys, where the lower band curvature raises the effective mass of the electrons and lowers electron mobility. The drop in drift velocity at high electric fields due to intervalley scattering is small in comparison to high saturation velocity that results from low optical phonon scattering. There is therefore an overall higher saturation velocity.

===Thermal properties===
Silicon and other common materials have a bandgap on the order of 1 to 1.5 electronvolt (eV), which implies that such semiconductor devices can be controlled by relatively low voltages. However, it also implies that they are more readily activated by thermal energy, which interferes with their proper operation. This limits silicon-based devices to operational temperatures below about 100 °C, beyond which the uncontrolled thermal activation of the devices makes it difficult for them to operate correctly. Wide-bandgap materials typically have bandgaps on the order of 2 to 4 eV, allowing them to operate at much higher temperatures on the order of 300 °C. This makes them highly attractive in military applications, where they have seen a fair amount of use.

Melting temperatures, thermal expansion coefficients, and thermal conductivity can be considered to be secondary properties that are essential in processing, and these properties are related to the bonding in wide-bandgap materials. Strong bonds result in higher melting temperatures and lower thermal expansion coefficients. A high Debye temperature results in a high thermal conductivity. With such thermal properties, heat is easily removed.

==Applications==

===High-power applications===
The high breakdown voltage of wide-bandgap semiconductors is a useful property in high-power applications that require large electric fields.

Devices for high power and high temperature applications have been developed. Both gallium nitride and silicon carbide are robust materials well suited for such applications. Due to its robustness and ease of manufacture, silicon carbide semiconductors are expected to be used widely, creating simpler and higher efficiency charging for hybrid and all-electric vehicles, reducing energy loss, constructing longer-lasting solar and wind energy power converters, and eliminating bulky grid substation transformers. Cubic boron nitride is used as well. Most of these are for specialist applications in space programmes and military systems. They have not begun to displace silicon from its leading place in the general power semiconductor market.

===Light-emitting diodes===
White LEDs have replaced incandescent bulbs in many situations because of their greater brightness and longer life. The next generation of DVD players (Blu-ray and HD DVD formats) use GaN-based violet lasers.

===Transducers===
Large piezoelectric effects allow wide-bandgap materials to be used as transducers.

===High-electron-mobility transistor===

Very high speed GaN uses the phenomenon of high interface-charge densities.

Due to its cost, aluminium nitride is so far used mostly in military applications.

== Challenges ==
Devices based on wide bandgap materials are capable of switching at much higher frequencies than silicon versions. They also tend to have much less leakage as well. As a result, higher voltages and more sensitive current measurements are required to properly characterize the WBG semiconductor during testing. 

Broadband semiconductor power devices require multiple measurements including on and off state, capacitive voltage and dynamic characteristics. In addition to dynamic performance, it is important to test key static parameters to avoid problems throughout the system. 

WBG testing may also require additional equipment to properly utilize some of the upgraded sensors. High-precision, high-capacity current sensors tend to be larger than less accurate options. As a result, they may require specialized testing structures that allow them to be used with minimal impact on circuit performance. 

While broadband semiconductors offer significant advantages, they pose manufacturing challenges. Producing high quality broadband materials on a large scale can be difficult and costly. Researchers and manufacturers are working to optimize manufacturing processes to make these materials more affordable.

<text>Peng Ming-min (; 15 August 19238 April 2022) was a Taiwanese democracy activist, advocate of Taiwan independence, legal scholar, and politician. Arrested for sedition in 1964 for printing a manifesto advocating democracy in his native Taiwan, he escaped to Sweden, before taking a post as a university teacher in the United States. After 22 years in exile he returned to become the Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s first presidential candidate in Taiwan&#x27;s first direct presidential election in 1996.

==Early life and education==
Born during Japanese rule to a prominent doctor&#x27;s family in rural Taiwan, Peng received his primary education in Taiwan before going to Tokyo for secondary education, graduating from Kwansei Gakuin Middle School in 1939 and the Third Higher School in 1942. During World War II, he studied law and political science at the Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo). At the end of the war, in order to avoid the American bombing of Japan&#x27;s capital, he decided to go to his brother near Nagasaki. En route to his brother, he lost his left arm in a bombing raid. While recuperating at his brother&#x27;s house, he witnessed the second atomic blast that destroyed the city of Nagasaki.

After the Japanese surrender, Peng returned to Taiwan and enrolled in the National Taiwan University. He was studying for his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the Law School when the February 28 Incident occurred. 

After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Peng went on to pursue a master&#x27;s degree (LL.M. 1953) at the Institute of Air and Space Law at the McGill University Faculty of Law, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, later a doctoral degree in law at the University of Paris in 1954. During his studies, Peng wrote some of the first essays on international air law published in France, Canada and Japan. His publications attracted considerable international attention and distinguished Peng as a pioneer in the new field of international air law.

==Academic career and exile==

Peng returned to Taiwan and in 1957, at age 34, he became the youngest full professor at the National Taiwan University. While Peng was a professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science from 1961 to 1962, he attracted the attention of Chiang Kai-shek and other Kuomintang (KMT) leaders. Chiang appointed Peng as the advisor to the Republic of China&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations, then the highest political position held by any Taiwanese, and hinted of future high-level governmental appointments. He quoted:

In 1964, Peng and two of his students, Hsieh Tsung-min and , created advocating the overthrow of the Chiang regime and the establishment of a democratic government in Taiwan. The three painstakingly printed 10,000 copies in secret, but before the manifesto could be distributed, Peng and his students were arrested on 20 September 1964. They languished in jail for several months before being tried for sedition by a military court. Peng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment but his case attracted worldwide attention. Bowing to the increasing international pressure, Chiang Kai-shek released Peng from military prison 14 months later, but placed him under house arrest for life with strict surveillance.

By 1968, his house arrest had become so suffocating that friends and , a member of the Taiwan independence movement in Japan helped plan for Peng&#x27;s escape from Taiwan. In 1970, Peng managed to travel by plane to Hong Kong and from there to Sweden with a forged passport. He was granted political asylum in Sweden, but despite the freedom he enjoyed in Europe, he decided to pursue an appointment at the University of Michigan. Both the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party strenuously objected, but the United States granted his request for a visa and Peng arrived in Michigan in August 1970. During his time at Michigan, he wrote his autobiography &quot;A Taste of Freedom&quot;.

While in exile, Peng continued to be a leading figure in Taiwan politics and American foreign policy issues. In 1981, he co-founded the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), a Taiwanese lobbying organization based in Washington D.C. Peng served as FAPA&#x27;s president from 1986 to 1988 and chaired the Asia-Pacific Democracy Association in 1989. He also testified on Taiwan issues before the United States Congress on several occasions.

==Return to Taiwan==
With the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988, Lee Teng-hui assumed the presidency and began to reform Taiwanese government. In 1992, he promulgated a revision of of the which not only allowed Taiwanese to advocate independence without being charged with sedition, but also granted amnesty to political prisoners and ended the overseas blacklist. No longer threatened with arrest, Peng returned to Taiwan on 2 November 1992 to a crowd of 1,000 people at Taoyuan International Airport. He had been in exile for 22 years. Peng joined the Democratic Progressive Party in February 1995.

On 28 September 1995, after an arduous two-tiered nomination process involving 49 public debates around Taiwan, the Democratic Progressive Party nominated Peng as their candidate for Taiwan&#x27;s first presidential elections. Outspokenly running on a platform of Taiwanese independence, he garnered 21% of the votes, a distant second to the incumbent Lee Teng-hui, who won the election.

In 2001, after Chen Shui-bian was elected president, Peng was appointed one of Chen&#x27;s senior advisors.

==Later life and death==
In 2009, Peng&#x27;s &quot;A Perfect Escape&quot; (逃亡), was published in Chinese, revealing the details of his dramatic escape in 1970. In July 2015, Peng and three others founded the Taiwan Independence Action Party. English translations of his articles were occasionally published in the &quot;Taipei Times&quot;.

Peng died on 8 April 2022 at age 98. His remains were interred in a cemetery at the Presbyterian Church in Yancheng District, Kaohsiung.

==Personal life==
Peng was an ardent baseball fan as a young boy, and when Babe Ruth visited Japan in the 1930s, he wrote a letter to Ruth and received an autograph in return.

<text>The City of Greater Dandenong is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne. It has an area of just under 130 square kilometres (50 sq mi) and 166,094 residents in 2018. 29% of its land area forms part of the South East Green Wedge. It was formed in 1994 by the merger of parts of the former City of Dandenong and City of Springvale.

The Bunurong/Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri peoples are the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which Greater Dandenong is now located.

==History==
In 1994, the state government restructured local government in Victoria. The reforms dissolved 210 councils and created 78 new councils through amalgamations. As part of the reforms City of Springvale and City of Dandenong were merged to create City of Greater Dandenong.

==Council==

Greater Dandenong City Council comprises 11 councillors, elected from single member wards. Prior to 2020, councillors were elected from four wards: Lightwood, Paperbark, Red Gum and Silverleaf. Councillors are elected to fixed-four year terms in a proportional manner using the STV voting system, with each ward electing Councillors based on their respective population.

Elections are held every four years, in accordance with the &quot;Local Government Act 1989&quot;, with voting being compulsory. Voter turnout figures by the Victorian Electoral Commission show that 81.7% of eligible voters voted at the council election in 2020.

===Current composition===
The composition of Greater Dandenong City Council is one of the most Labor-dominated in the state, demonstrated by its high percentage of councillors who are members of the party and its below-average number of independent councillors. This political membership is reflected through the local federal and state MPs, both of whom are ALP-affiliated. The most recent elections were held on 26 October 2024 and produced the following results:

===Mayor===

The mayor is the head of the municipality, leading and coordinating the council&#x27;s work. The position of mayor is a mostly ceremonial one, expected to represent the City and act as its public spokesperson. The mayor is not entirely a figurehead, however, instead being tasked with chairing council meetings and being involved with a greater number of community events such as citizenship ceremonies.

A mayor is elected among the councillors for a term of one year, meaning that each period between two local government elections usually sees four mayorships. Clare O&#x27;Neil became the youngest female mayor in Australian history when she served as mayor of Greater Dandenong from March to November 2004.

<text>Charles Wood (15 June 1866 – 12 July 1926) was an Irish composer and teacher; his students included Ralph Vaughan Williams at Cambridge and Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music. He is primarily remembered and performed as an Anglican church music composer, but he also wrote songs and chamber music, particularly for string quartet.

==Early life and education==
Born in Vicars&#x27; Hill in the Cathedral precincts of Armagh, Ireland, Charles was the fifth child and third son of Charles Wood Sr. and Jemima Wood. The boy was a treble chorister in the choir of the nearby St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (Church of Ireland). His father sang tenor as a stipendiary &#x27;Gentleman&#x27; or &#x27;Lay Vicar Choral&#x27; in the Cathedral choir and was also the Diocesan Registrar of the church. He was a cousin of Irish composer Ina Boyle. The organist and composer William G Wood (1859-1895), also associated with Cambridge, was his elder brother.

Wood received his early education at the Cathedral Choir School and also studied organ with two organists and masters of the Boys of Armagh Cathedral, Robert Turle and his successor Dr Thomas Marks. In 1883 he became one of fifty inaugural class members of the Royal College of Music, studying composition with Charles Villiers Stanford and Charles Hubert Hastings Parry primarily, and horn and piano secondarily. Following four years of training, he continued his studies at Selwyn College, Cambridge until 1889. 

==Teaching career==
He began teaching harmony and counterpoint at Selwyn College. In 1889 he attained a teaching position at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, first as organ scholar and then as fellow in 1894, becoming their first director of music and organist. He was instrumental in the reflowering of music at the college, though more as a teacher and organiser of musical events than as composer. After Stanford died in 1924, Wood assumed his mentor&#x27;s vacant role as Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge.

According to his successor at Cambridge, Edward J Dent, as a teacher of composition, Wood &quot;was surpassed only by Stanford himself [and] as a teacher of counterpoint and fugue he was unequalled&quot;. His pupils at Cambridge included Ralph Vaughan Williams, Nicholas Gatty, Arthur Bliss, Cecil Armstrong Gibbs and W Denis Browne. Dent says that, because Stanford did not reside in Cambridge, Wood took on the real burden of teaching for many years before his own election as Professor of Music, by which time his health was already undermined. He died in July 1926 after only two years in the post.

==Personal life==
He married Charlotte Georgina Wills-Sandford, daughter of William Robert Wills-Sandford, of Castlerea, County Roscommon, Ireland, on 17 March 1898. They had two sons and three daughters, including Lieutenant Patrick Bryan Sandford Wood R.A.F. (1899-1918), who was killed in an aircraft accident during the First World War and is buried at Taranto, Italy. The family&#x27;s address in Cambridge was 17, Cranmer Road. 

Wood is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, together with his wife. There is a memorial to him in the north aisle at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh.

==Music==
Like his better-known colleague Stanford, Wood is chiefly remembered for his Anglican church music: there are over 250 sacred works and many hymn tunes. As well as his Communion Service in the Phrygian Mode, his settings of the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis are still popular with cathedral and parish church choirs, particularly the services in F, D and G, and the two settings in E flat. During Passiontide his &quot;St Mark Passion&quot;, written in 1920 for Eric Milner-White, the then Dean of King’s College, Cambridge, is sometimes performed. It demonstrates Wood&#x27;s interest in modal composition, in contrast to the late romantic harmonic style he more usually employs.

Wood&#x27;s anthems with organ, &quot;Expectans expectavi&quot;, and &quot;O Thou, the Central Orb&quot; are both frequently performed and recorded; as are his unaccompanied anthems &quot;Tis the day of Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Glory and Honour&quot; and, most popular of all, &quot;Hail, gladdening light&quot; and its lesser-known equivalent for men&#x27;s voices, &quot;Great Lord of Lords&quot;. All Wood&#x27;s &quot;a cappella&quot; music demonstrates fastidious craftsmanship and a supreme mastery of the genre, and he is no less resourceful in his accompanied choral works which sometimes include unison sections and have stirring organ accompaniments, conveying a satisfying warmth and richness of emotional expression appropriate to his carefully chosen texts.

After the fashion of the time Wood composed a series of secular choral cantatas between 1885 and 1905, including &quot;On Time&quot; (1897-8, setting Milton), &quot;Dirge for Two Veterans&quot; (1901, setting Walt Whitman), and &quot;A Ballad of Dundee&quot; (1904, setting W.E. Aytoun). There were also madrigals (including &quot;If Love be Dead&quot;, setting Coleridge), part songs (such as &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot;) and solo songs, one of which, &quot;Ethiopia Saluting the Colours&quot; (setting Walt Whitman) attained high popularity.

Of the orchestral works, both the Piano Concerto (1886) and the &quot;Patrick Sarsfield Variations&quot; (1899) remained unpublished, although the &quot;Variations&quot; received a performance at the Queen&#x27;s Hall Beecham Concerts in 1907. Walter Starkie said the work &quot;shows his power of creating what may be called the Irish atmosphere in music&quot;. It has been revived in modern times by the Ulster Orchestra, conducted by Simon Joly. However, Wood appears to have lost confidence and abandoned the orchestral medium after 1905. Three symphonies and an opera remained uncompleted.

He also composed eight string quartets (six numbered, plus the &quot;Variations on an Irish Folk Tune&quot; and a first movement fragment in G minor), spanning 1885 to 1917. The early quartets show the influence of Brahms, but from No. 3 in A minor (1911) a more personal voice emerges, partly through the use of Irish folk melodies and dance tunes as thematic material. There is a modern recording of No. 3 by the Lindsay Quartet and the London Chamber Ensemble has published No. 6 (2024; see Discography below). The quartets were edited after the composer&#x27;s death by Edward Dent and published in a collected edition by Oxford University Press in 1929.

Wood collaborated with priest and poet George Ratcliffe Woodward in the revival and popularisation of Renaissance tunes to new English religious texts, notably co-editing three books of carols including The Cowley Carol Book. Their collaboration also produced Songs of Syon. He was co-founder (in 1904) of the Irish Folk Song Society. Wood&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;The Irish Famine Song (The Praties They Grow Small Over Here)&quot; was recorded in the early 1920s by the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, and released on Vocalion A-0168.

<doc id="467198" wikidata="Q411713" url="?curid=467198" title="Gallium nitride">
<text>Gallium nitride () is a binary III/V direct bandgap semiconductor commonly used in blue light-emitting diodes since the 1990s. The compound is a very hard material that has a Wurtzite crystal structure. Its wide band gap of 3.4 eV affords it special properties for applications in optoelectronics, high-power and high-frequency devices. For example, GaN is the substrate that makes violet (405 nm) laser diodes possible, without requiring nonlinear optical frequency doubling.

Its sensitivity to ionizing radiation is low (like other group III nitrides), making it a suitable material for solar cell arrays for satellites. Military and space applications could also benefit as devices have shown stability in high radiation environments.

Because GaN transistors can operate at much higher temperatures and work at much higher voltages than gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistors, they make ideal power amplifiers at microwave frequencies. In addition, GaN offers promising characteristics for THz devices. Due to high power density and voltage breakdown limits GaN is also emerging as a promising candidate for 5G cellular base station applications. Since the early 2020s, GaN power transistors have come into increasing use in power supplies in electronic equipment, converting AC mains electricity to low-voltage DC.

== Physical properties ==
GaN is a very hard (Knoop hardness 14.21 GPa), mechanically stable wide-bandgap semiconductor material with high heat capacity and thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1143/JJAP.36.5393&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In its pure form it resists cracking and can be deposited in thin film on sapphire or silicon carbide, despite the mismatch in their lattice constants. GaN can be doped with silicon (Si) or with oxygen to n-type and with magnesium (Mg) to p-type.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1143/JJAP.28.L2112&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Si and Mg atoms change the way the GaN crystals grow, introducing tensile stresses and making them brittle.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1143/JJAP.40.L195&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gallium nitride compounds also tend to have a high dislocation density, on the order of 108 to 1010 defects per square centimeter.

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) provided the first measurement of the high field electron velocity in GaN in 1999. Scientists at ARL experimentally obtained a peak steady-state velocity of , with a transit time of 2.5 picoseconds, attained at an electric field of 225 kV/cm. With this information, the electron mobility was calculated, thus providing data for the design of GaN devices.

== Developments ==
One of the earliest syntheses of gallium nitride was at the George Herbert Jones Laboratory in 1932.

An early synthesis of gallium nitride was by Robert Juza and Harry Hahn in 1938.

GaN with a high crystalline quality can be obtained by depositing a buffer layer at low temperatures. Such high-quality GaN led to the discovery of p-type GaN, p–n junction blue/UV-LEDs and room-temperature stimulated emission&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1143/JJAP.29.L205&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (essential for laser action).&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.7567/JJAP.34.L1517&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the commercialization of high-performance blue LEDs and long-lifetime violet laser diodes, and to the development of nitride-based devices such as UV detectors and high-speed field-effect transistors.

=== LEDs ===
High-brightness GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) completed the range of primary colors, and made possible applications such as daylight-visible full-color LED displays, white LEDs and blue laser devices. The first GaN-based high-brightness LEDs used a thin film of GaN deposited via metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on sapphire. Other substrates used are zinc oxide, with lattice constant mismatch of only 2% and silicon carbide (SiC). Group III nitride semiconductors are, in general, recognized as one of the most promising semiconductor families for fabricating optical devices in the visible short-wavelength and UV region.

=== GaN transistors and power ICs ===
The very high breakdown voltages, high electron mobility, and high saturation velocity of GaN has made it an ideal candidate for high-power and high-temperature microwave applications, as evidenced by its high Johnson&#x27;s figure of merit. Potential markets for high-power/high-frequency devices based on GaN include microwave radio-frequency power amplifiers (e.g., those used in high-speed wireless data transmission) and high-voltage switching devices for power grids. A potential mass-market application for GaN-based RF transistors is as the microwave source for microwave ovens, replacing the magnetrons currently used. The large band gap means that the performance of GaN transistors is maintained up to higher temperatures (~400 °C) than silicon transistors (~150 °C) because it lessens the effects of thermal generation of charge carriers that are inherent to any semiconductor. The first gallium nitride metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (GaN MESFET) were experimentally demonstrated in 1993 and they are being actively developed.

In 2010, the first enhancement-mode GaN transistors became generally available. Only n-channel transistors were available. These devices were designed to replace power MOSFETs in applications where switching speed or power conversion efficiency is critical. These transistors are built by growing a thin layer of GaN on top of a standard silicon wafer, often referred to as &quot;GaN-on-Si&quot; by manufacturers. This allows the FETs to maintain costs similar to silicon power MOSFETs but with the superior electrical performance of GaN. Another seemingly viable solution for realizing enhancement-mode GaN-channel HFETs is to employ a lattice-matched quaternary AlInGaN layer of acceptably low spontaneous polarization mismatch to GaN.

GaN power ICs monolithically integrate a GaN FET, GaN-based drive circuitry and circuit protection into a single surface-mount device. Integration means that the gate-drive loop has essentially zero impedance, which further improves efficiency by virtually eliminating FET turn-off losses. Academic studies into creating low-voltage GaN power ICs began at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and the first devices were demonstrated in 2015. Commercial GaN power IC production began in 2018.

==== CMOS logic ====
In 2016 the first GaN CMOS logic using PMOS and NMOS transistors was reported with gate lengths of 0.5 μm (gate widths of the PMOS and NMOS transistors were 500 μm and 50 μm, respectively).

== Applications ==
=== LEDs and lasers ===
GaN-based violet laser diodes are used to read Blu-ray Discs. The mixture of GaN with In (InGaN) or Al (AlGaN) with a band gap dependent on the ratio of In or Al to GaN allows the manufacture of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with colors that can go from red to ultra-violet.

=== Transistors and power ICs ===

GaN transistors are suitable for high frequency, high voltage, high temperature and high-efficiency applications. GaN is efficient at transferring current, and this ultimately means that less energy is lost to heat. 

GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMT) have been offered commercially since 2006, and have found immediate use in various wireless infrastructure applications due to their high efficiency and high voltage operation. A second generation of devices with shorter gate lengths will address higher-frequency telecom and aerospace applications.

GaN-based metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET) and metal–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFET) also offer advantages including lower loss in high power electronics, especially in automotive and electric car applications. Since 2008 these can be formed on a silicon substrate. High-voltage (800 V) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) have also been made.

The higher efficiency and high power density of integrated GaN power ICs allows them to reduce the size, weight and component count of applications including mobile and laptop chargers, consumer electronics, computing equipment and electric vehicles.

GaN-based electronics (not pure GaN) have the potential to drastically cut energy consumption, not only in consumer applications but even for power transmission utilities.

Unlike silicon transistors that switch off due to power surges, GaN transistors are typically depletion mode devices (i.e. on / resistive when the gate-source voltage is zero). Several methods have been proposed to reach normally-off (or E-mode) operation, which is necessary for use in power electronics:
* the implantation of fluorine ions under the gate (the negative charge of the F-ions favors the depletion of the channel)
* the use of a MIS-type gate stack, with recess of the AlGaN
* the integration of a cascaded pair constituted by a normally-on GaN transistor and a low voltage silicon MOSFET
* the use of a p-type layer on top of the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction

=== Radars ===
GaN technology is also utilized in military electronics such as active electronically scanned array radars.

Thales Group introduced the Ground Master 400 radar in 2010 utilizing GaN technology. In 2021 Thales put in operation more than 50,000 GaN Transmitters on radar systems.

The U.S. Army funded Lockheed Martin to incorporate GaN active-device technology into the AN/TPQ-53 radar system to replace two medium-range radar systems, the AN/TPQ-36 and the AN/TPQ-37. The AN/TPQ-53 radar system was designed to detect, classify, track, and locate enemy indirect fire systems, as well as unmanned aerial systems. The AN/TPQ-53 radar system provided enhanced performance, greater mobility, increased reliability and supportability, lower life-cycle cost, and reduced crew size compared to the AN/TPQ-36 and the AN/TPQ-37 systems.

Lockheed Martin fielded other tactical operational radars with GaN technology in 2018, including TPS-77 Multi Role Radar System deployed to Latvia and Romania. In 2019, Lockheed Martin&#x27;s partner ELTA Systems Limited, developed a GaN-based ELM-2084 Multi Mission Radar that was able to detect and track air craft and ballistic targets, while providing fire control guidance for missile interception or air defense artillery.

On April 8, 2020, Saab flight tested its new GaN designed AESA X-band radar in a JAS-39 Gripen fighter. Saab already offers products with GaN based radars, like the Giraffe radar, Erieye, GlobalEye, and Arexis EW. Saab also delivers major subsystems, assemblies and software for the AN/TPS-80 (G/ATOR)

India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation is developing Virupaakhsha radar for Sukhoi Su-30MKI based on GaN technology. The radar is a further development of Uttam AESA Radar for use on HAL Tejas which employs GaAs technology. 

=== Nanoscale ===
GaN nanotubes and nanowires are proposed for applications in nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics and biochemical-sensing applications.

=== Spintronics potential ===
When doped with a suitable transition metal such as manganese, GaN is a promising spintronics material (magnetic semiconductors).

== Synthesis ==
=== Bulk substrates ===
GaN crystals can be grown from a molten Na/Ga melt held under 100 atmospheres of pressure of N2 at 750 °C. As Ga will not react with N2 below 1000 °C, the powder must be made from something more reactive, usually in one of the following ways:
: 2 Ga + 2 NH3 → 2 GaN + 3 H2
: Ga2O3 + 2 NH3 → 2 GaN + 3 H2O

Gallium nitride can also be synthesized by injecting ammonia gas into molten gallium at at normal atmospheric pressure.

=== Metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy ===
Blue, white and ultraviolet LEDs are grown on industrial scale by metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The precursors are ammonia with either trimethylgallium or triethylgallium, the carrier gas being nitrogen or hydrogen. Growth temperature ranges between . Introduction of trimethylaluminium and/or trimethylindium is necessary for growing quantum wells and other kinds of heterostructures.

=== Molecular beam epitaxy ===
Commercially, GaN crystals can be grown using molecular beam epitaxy or MOVPE. This process can be further modified to reduce dislocation densities. First, an ion beam is applied to the growth surface in order to create nanoscale roughness. Then, the surface is polished. This process takes place in a vacuum. Polishing methods typically employ a liquid electrolyte and UV irradiation to enable mechanical removal of a thin oxide layer from the wafer. More recent methods have been developed that utilize solid-state polymer electrolytes that are solvent-free and require no radiation before polishing.

== Safety ==
GaN dust is an irritant to skin, eyes and lungs. The environment, health and safety aspects of gallium nitride sources (such as trimethylgallium and ammonia) and industrial hygiene monitoring studies of MOVPE sources have been reported in a 2004 review.

Bulk GaN is non-toxic and biocompatible. Therefore, it may be used in the electrodes and electronics of implants in living organisms.

<doc id="467199" wikidata="Q33973" url="?curid=467199" title="Sicilian language">
<text>Sicilian (, ; ) is a Romance language that is spoken on the island of Sicily and its satellite islands.
It belongs to the broader Extreme Southern Italian language group (in Italian ).

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; (see below for more detail) describes Sicilian as being &quot;distinct enough from Standard Italian to be considered a separate language&quot;, and it is recognized as a minority language by UNESCO. It has been referred to as a language by the Sicilian Region. It has the oldest literary tradition of the Italo-Romance languages. A version of the &quot;UNESCO Courier&quot; is also available in Sicilian.

== Status ==

Sicilian is spoken by most inhabitants of Sicily and by emigrant populations around the world. The latter are found in the countries that attracted large numbers of Sicilian immigrants during the course of the past century or so, especially the United States (specifically in the Gravesend and Bensonhurst neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York City, and in Buffalo and Western New York State), Canada (especially in Montreal, Toronto and Hamilton), Australia, Venezuela and Argentina. During the last four or five decades, large numbers of Sicilians were also attracted to the industrial zones of Northern Italy and areas of the European Union.

Although the Sicilian language does not have official status (including in Sicily), in addition to the standard Sicilian of the medieval Sicilian school, academics have developed a standardized form. Such efforts began in the mid-19th century when Vincenzo Mortillaro published a comprehensive Sicilian language dictionary intended to capture the language universally spoken across Sicily in a common orthography. Later in the century, Giuseppe Pitrè established a common grammar in his &quot;Grammatica Siciliana&quot; (1875). Although it presents a common grammar, it also provides detailed notes on how the sounds of Sicilian differ across dialects.

In the 20th century, researchers at the Centro di studi filologici e linguistici siciliani developed an extensive descriptivist orthography which aims to represent every sound in the natural range of Sicilian accurately. This system is also used extensively in the Vocabolario siciliano and by Gaetano Cipolla in his &quot;Learn Sicilian&quot; series of textbooks and by Arba Sicula in its journal.

In initially 2017, with an updated version in 2024 the nonprofit organisation Cademia Siciliana created an orthographic proposal to help to normalise the language&#x27;s written form. This orthography was used by the organisation in their collaboration with Google to bring the Sicilian Language to Google Translate.

The autonomous regional parliament of Sicily has legislated Regional Law No. 9/2011 to encourage the teaching of Sicilian at all schools, but inroads into the education system have been slow. The CSFLS created a textbook &quot;Dialektos&quot; to comply with the law but does not provide an orthography to write the language. In Sicily, it is taught only as part of dialectology courses, but outside Italy, Sicilian has been taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Brooklyn College and Manouba University. Since 2009, it has been taught at the Italian Charities of America, in New York City (home to the largest Sicilian speaking community outside of Sicily and Italy) and it is also preserved and taught by family association, church organisations and societies, social and ethnic historical clubs and even Internet social groups, mainly in Gravesend and Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. On 15 May 2018, the Sicilian Region once again mandated the teaching of Sicilian in schools and referred to it as a language, not a dialect, in official communication.
The language is officially recognized in the municipal statutes of some Sicilian towns, such as Caltagirone and Grammichele, in which the &quot;inalienable historical and cultural value of the Sicilian language&quot; is proclaimed. Furthermore, the Sicilian language would be protected and promoted under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML). Although Italy has signed the treaty, the Italian Parliament has not ratified it. It is not included in Italian Law No. 482/1999 although some other minority languages of Sicily are.

== Ethnologue report ==
=== Other names ===
Alternative names of Sicilian are , , and . The first term refers to the fact that a form of Sicilian is spoken in southern Calabria, particularly in the province of Reggio Calabria. The other two are names for the language in Sicily itself: specifically, the term originally describes one of the larger prehistoric groups living in Sicily (the Italic Sicels or ) before the arrival of Greeks in the 8th century BC (see below). It can also be used as a prefix to qualify or to elaborate further on the origins of a person, for example: Siculo-American () or Siculo-Australian.

=== Dialects ===
As a language, Sicilian has its own dialects in the following main groupings:
*Western Sicilian (Palermitano in Palermo, Trapanese in Trapani, Central-Western Agrigentino in Agrigento)
*Central Metafonetic (in the central part of Sicily that includes some areas of the provinces of Caltanissetta, Messina, Enna, Palermo and Agrigento)
*Southeast Metafonetic (in the Province of Ragusa and the adjoining area within the Province of Syracuse)
*Ennese (in the Province of Enna)
*Eastern Non-Metafonetic (in the area including the Metropolitan City of Catania, the second largest city in Sicily, as Catanese, and the adjoining area within the Province of Syracuse)
*Messinese (in the Metropolitan City of Messina, the third largest city in Sicily)
*Eoliano (in the Aeolian Islands)
*Pantesco (on the island of Pantelleria)
*Reggino (in the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria, especially on the Scilla–Bova line, and excluding the areas of Locri and Rosarno, which represent the first isogloss that divide Sicilian from the continental varieties).

== History ==

=== Early influences ===
Because Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and many peoples have passed through it (Phoenicians, Ancient Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Swabians, Spaniards, Austrians, Italians), Sicilian displays a rich and varied influence from several languages in its lexical stock and grammar. These languages include Latin (as Sicilian is a Romance language itself), Ancient Greek, Byzantine Greek, Spanish, Norman, Lombard, Hebrew, Catalan, Occitan, Arabic and Germanic languages, and the languages of the island&#x27;s aboriginal Indo-European and pre-Indo-European inhabitants, known as the Sicels, Sicanians and Elymians. The very earliest influences, visible in Sicilian to this day, exhibit both prehistoric Mediterranean elements and prehistoric Indo-European elements, and occasionally a blending of both.

Before the Roman conquest (3rd century BC), Sicily was occupied by various populations. The earliest of these populations were the Sicanians, considered to be autochthonous. The Sicels and the Elymians arrived between the second and first millennia BC. These aboriginal populations in turn were followed by the Phoenicians (between the 10th and 8th centuries BC) and the Greeks. The heavy Greek-language influence remains strongly visible, while the influences from the other groups are smaller and less obvious. What can be stated with certainty is that in Sicilian remain pre-Indo-European words of an ancient Mediterranean origin, but one cannot be more precise than that: of the three main prehistoric groups, only the Sicels were known to be Indo-European with a degree of certainty, and their speech is likely to have been closely related to that of the Romans.

=== Stratification ===
The following table, listing words for &quot;twins&quot;, illustrates the difficulty linguists face in tackling the various substrata of the Sicilian language.
A similar qualifier can be applied to many of the words that appear in this article. Sometimes it may be known that a particular word has a prehistoric derivation, but it is not known whether the Sicilians inherited it directly from the indigenous populations, or whether it came via another route. Similarly, it might be known that a particular word has a Greek origin but it is not known from which Greek period the Sicilians first used it (ancient Magna Grecia or the Byzantine period), or once again, whether the particular word may even have come to Sicily via another route. For instance, by the time the Romans had occupied Sicily, the Latin language had made its own borrowings from Greek.

=== Pre-classical period ===
The words with a prehistoric Mediterranean derivation often refer to plants native to the Mediterranean region or to other natural features. Bearing in mind the qualifiers mentioned above (alternative sources are provided where known), examples of such words include:
* – &quot;spiny broom&quot; (a thorny, prickly plant native to the Mediterranean region; but also Greek and may in fact have penetrated Sicilian via one of the Gaulish languages)
* – &quot;to dam or block a canal or running water&quot; (but also Spanish &quot;to muddy&quot;)
* – &quot;ripples caused by a fast running river&quot;
* – &quot;landslide of rocks&quot; (cf. Greek χαλάω (khaláō) &quot;loosen, drop&quot;, verb borrowed into Latin, widespread in Romance languages)
* – &quot;stalk or stem of a fruit etc.&quot; (ancient Mediterranean word &quot;rak&quot;)
* – &quot;crag, cliff&quot; (but also Greek , Latin and Catalan ).

There are also Sicilian words with an ancient Indo-European origin that do not appear to have come to the language via any of the major language groups normally associated with Sicilian, i.e. they have been independently derived from a very early Indo-European source. The Sicels are a possible source of such words, but there is also the possibility of a cross-over between ancient Mediterranean words and introduced Indo-European forms. Some examples of Sicilian words with an ancient Indo-European origin:
* – &quot;mulberry&quot; (similar to Indo-European &quot;*h₁rowdʰós&quot;, Romanian and Welsh &quot;red, crimson&quot;)
* – &quot;not well developed&quot; (similar to Lithuanian with a similar meaning and Old High German &quot;short&quot;)
* – &quot;multitude, vast number&quot; (from Indo-European &quot;*h₁we[n]d-&quot; &quot;water&quot;).

=== Greek influences ===
The following Sicilian words are of a Greek origin (including some examples where it is unclear whether the word is derived directly from Greek, or via Latin):
* – &quot;to fool around&quot; (from , which also gives the Sicilian words: and &quot;stupid&quot;; but also Latin and Spanish )
* – &quot;pitcher&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese &quot;buqar&quot;, Italian &quot;boccale&quot;)
* – &quot;water receptacle&quot; (from ; but also Latin ) (cognate of Maltese &quot;bomblu&quot;)
* – &quot;basket&quot; (from ; but also Latin )
* – &quot;boy&quot; (from ; but also Latin &quot;carus&quot; &quot;dear&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;amiable&quot;)
* – &quot;earthworm&quot; (from )
* – &quot;cherry&quot; (from ; but also Latin ) (cognate of Maltese &quot;ċirasa&quot;)
* – &quot;icon, image, metaphor&quot; (from ; but also Latin )
* – type of bread (from ; but Latin )
* – &quot;flower pot&quot; (from ; but also Latin )
* – &quot;cradle&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to stun, amaze&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to eat&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to knock&quot; (from )
* - &quot;small, young&quot; (from )

=== Germanic influences ===
From 476 to 535, the Ostrogoths ruled Sicily, although their presence apparently did not affect the Sicilian language. The few Germanic influences to be found in Sicilian do not appear to originate from this period. One exception might be or &quot;to hawk goods, proclaim publicly&quot;, from Gothic &quot;to give a signal&quot;. Also possible is &quot;diagonal&quot; from Gothic &quot;slanting&quot;. Other sources of Germanic influences include the Hohenstaufen rule of the 13th century, words of Germanic origin contained within the speech of 11th-century Normans and Lombard settlers, and the short period of Austrian rule in the 18th century.

Many Germanic influences date back to the time of the Swabian kings (amongst whom Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor enjoyed the longest reign). Some of the words below are &quot;reintroductions&quot; of Latin words (also found in modern Italian) that had been Germanicized at some point (e.g. in Latin to in modern Italian). Words that probably originate from this era include:
* – &quot;to work in the fields&quot; (from ; but other possible Latin derivations)
* – &quot;to watch over&quot; (from )
* – &quot;forest, woods&quot; (from ; note the resemblance to Anglo-Saxon )
* – &quot;to wag, as in a tail&quot; (from )
* (terracotta jug for holding water; from Old High German )
* – &quot;to save money&quot; (from Old High German )

=== Arabic influence ===
In 535, Justinian I made Sicily a Byzantine province, which returned the Greek language to a position of prestige, at least on an official level. At this time the island could be considered a border zone with moderate levels of bilingualism: Latinisation was mostly concentrated in western Sicily, largely among the upper class, whereas Eastern Sicily remained predominantly Greek. As the power of the Byzantine Empire waned, Sicily was progressively conquered by Saracens from Ifriqiya, from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries. The Emirate of Sicily persisted long enough to develop a distinctive local variety of Arabic, Siculo-Arabic (at present extinct in Sicily but surviving as the Maltese language). Its influence is noticeable in around 300 Sicilian words, most of which relate to agriculture and related activities. This is understandable because of the Arab Agricultural Revolution; the Saracens introduced to Sicily their advanced irrigation and farming techniques and a new range of crops, nearly all of which remain endemic to the island to this day.

Some words of Arabic origin:
* – &quot;to embellish&quot; ( &quot;precious, beautiful&quot;) (Cognate of Maltese &quot;għażiż&quot;, meaning &quot;dear&quot;)
* – &quot;snail&quot; (from , Tunisian ; but also Greek . Cognate of Maltese &quot;bebbuxu)&quot;
* – &quot;jar&quot; ( ; but also Latin )
* (measure for liquids; from Tunisian )
* (Sicilian ricotta cake; from , chiefly North African; but Latin &quot;something made from cheese&quot;. Cognate of Maltese &quot;qassata&quot;)
* – artificial pond to store water for irrigation (from Tunisian . Cognate of Maltese &quot;ġiebja&quot; and Spanish )
* – &quot;sesame seed&quot; (from Tunisian or . Cognate of Maltese &quot;ġunġlien&quot; or &quot;ġulġlien&quot; and Spanish ).
* – &quot;leader&quot; ( . Cognate of Maltese &quot;ras&quot; &quot;head&quot;)
* – &quot;canal&quot; (from . Cognate of Spanish &quot;acequia&quot; Maltese &quot;saqqajja&quot;)
* – &quot;saffron&quot; (type of plant whose flowers are used for medicinal purposes and in Sicilian cooking; from . Cognate of Maltese &quot;żagħfran&quot; and English &quot;Saffron&quot;)
* – &quot;blossom&quot; ( . Cognate of Maltese &quot;żahar&quot; and Spanish )
* – &quot;muscat of Alexandria&quot; (type of dried grape; . Cognate of Maltese &quot;żbib&quot;)
* – &quot;market&quot; (from ; but also Aragonese and Spanish . Cognate of Maltese &quot;suq&quot;)
* (the northern gate of Agrigento; &quot;Gate of the Winds&quot;).
* &quot;Gisira&quot; – &quot;island&quot; (جَزِيرَة‎ &quot;jazīra&quot;. Cognate of Maltese &quot;gżira&quot;) &quot;(archaic)&quot;

Throughout the Islamic epoch of Sicilian history, a significant Greek-speaking population remained on the island and continued to use the Greek language, or most certainly a variant of Greek influenced by Tunisian Arabic. What is less clear is the extent to which a Latin-speaking population survived on the island. While a form of Vulgar Latin clearly survived in isolated communities during the Islamic epoch, there is much debate as to the influence it had (if any) on the development of the Sicilian language, following the re-Latinisation of Sicily (discussed in the next section).

=== Linguistic developments in the Middle Ages ===

By AD 1000, the whole of what is today Southern Italy, including Sicily, was a complex mix of small states and principalities, languages and religions. The whole of Sicily was controlled by Saracens, at the elite level, but the general population remained a mix of Muslims and Christians who spoke Greek, Latin or Siculo-Arabic. The far south of the Italian peninsula was part of the Byzantine empire although many communities were reasonably independent from Constantinople. The Principality of Salerno was controlled by Lombards (or Langobards), who had also started to make some incursions into Byzantine territory and had managed to establish some isolated independent city-states. It was into this climate that the Normans thrust themselves with increasing numbers during the first half of the 11th century.

=== Norman and French influence ===
When the two most famous of Southern Italy&#x27;s Norman adventurers, Roger of Hauteville and his brother, Robert Guiscard, began their conquest of Sicily in 1061, they already controlled the far south of Italy (Apulia and Calabria). It took Roger 30 years to complete the conquest of Sicily (Robert died in 1085). In the aftermath of the Norman conquest of Sicily, the reintroduction of Latin in Sicily had begun, and some Norman words would be absorbed, that would be accompanied with an additional wave of Parisian French loanwords during the rule of Charles I from the Capetian House of Anjou in the 13th century.
* – &quot;to buy&quot; (from Norman French , French ; but there are different varieties of this Latin etymon in the &quot;Romania&quot;, cf. Old Occitan )
* – &quot;to hide&quot; (Old Norman French , Norman French /, Old French ; but also Greek )
* / &quot;butcher&quot; (from Old French )
* – &quot;tailor&quot; (Old French ; Modern French )
* – &quot;grey&quot; (from Old French )
* – &quot;mad&quot; (Old French , whence French )
* – &quot;July&quot; (Old French )
* / – &quot;ugly&quot; (Old French )
* – &quot;generosity&quot; (; but also Spanish )
* – &quot;thumb&quot; (Old French )
* – &quot;grape&quot; (Old French, French )
* – &quot;anger&quot; (Old French, French )
* – &quot;to hop, skip&quot; (Norman French )

=== Other Gallic influences ===
The Northern Italian influence is of particular interest. Even to the present day, Gallo-Italic of Sicily exists in the areas where the Northern Italian colonies were the strongest, namely Novara, Nicosia, Sperlinga, Aidone and Piazza Armerina. The Siculo-Gallic dialect did not survive in other major Italian colonies, such as Randazzo, Caltagirone, Bronte and Paternò (although they influenced the local Sicilian vernacular). The Gallo-Italic influence was also felt on the Sicilian language itself, as follows:
* – &quot;father-in-law&quot; (from )
* – &quot;brother-in-law&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese )
* – &quot;godson&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese )
* / – blind (from &quot;orb&quot;)
* – &quot;to rinse&quot; (from )
* – &quot;where&quot; (from &quot;ond&quot;)
* the names of the days of the week:
** – &quot;Monday&quot; (from )
** – &quot;Tuesday&quot; (from )
** – &quot;Wednesday&quot; (from )
** – &quot;Thursday&quot; (from )
** – &quot;Friday&quot; (from )

=== Occitan influence ===
The origins of another Romance influence, that of Occitan, had three reasons:
# The Normans made San Fratello a garrison town in the early years of the occupation of the northeastern corner of Sicily. To this day (in ever decreasing numbers) a Siculo-Gallic dialect is spoken in San Fratello that is clearly influenced by Occitan, which leads to the conclusion that a significant number in the garrison came from that part of France. This may well explain the dialect spoken only in San Fratello, but it does not wholly explain the diffusion of many Occitan words into the Sicilian language. On that point, there are two other possibilities:
# Some Occitan words have entered the language during the regency of Margaret of Navarre between 1166 and 1171, when her son, William II of Sicily, succeeded to the throne at the age of 12. Her closest advisers, entourage and administrators were from the south of France, and many Occitan words entered the language during this period.
# The Sicilian School of poetry was strongly influenced by the Occitan of the troubadour tradition. This element is deeply embedded in Sicilian culture: for example, the tradition of Sicilian puppetry () and the tradition of the (literally &quot;story-singers&quot;). Occitan troubadours were active during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and some Occitan words would have passed into the Sicilian language via this route.

Some examples of Sicilian words derived from Occitan:
* – &quot;to light, to turn something on&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to kidnap, abduct&quot; (from ; but also German )
* – &quot;side, place&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese &quot;banda&quot; &quot;side&quot;)
* – &quot;landowner, citizen&quot; (from )
* – &quot;sparse, thin, infrequent&quot; (from )(cognate of Maltese &quot;loose&quot;)

=== Sicilian School of Poetry ===

It was during the reign of Frederick II (or Frederick I of Sicily) between 1198 and 1250, with his patronage of the Sicilian School, that Sicilian became the first of the modern Italic languages to be used as a literary language. The influence of the school and the use of Sicilian itself as a poetic language was acknowledged by the two great Tuscan writers of the early Renaissance period, Dante and Petrarch. The influence of the Sicilian language should not be underestimated in the eventual formulation of a &quot;lingua franca&quot; that was to become modern Italian. The victory of the Angevin army over the Sicilians at Benevento in 1266 not only marked the end of the 136-year Norman-Swabian reign in Sicily but also effectively ensured that the centre of literary influence would eventually move from Sicily to Tuscany. While Sicilian, as both an official and a literary language, would continue to exist for another two centuries, the language would soon follow the fortunes of the kingdom itself in terms of prestige and influence.

=== Catalan influence ===
Following the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, the kingdom came under the influence of the Crown of Aragon, and the Catalan language (and the closely related Aragonese) added a new layer of vocabulary in the succeeding century. For the whole of the 14th century, both Catalan and Sicilian were the official languages of the royal court. Sicilian was also used to record the proceedings of the Parliament of Sicily (one of the oldest parliaments in Europe) and for other official purposes. While it is often difficult to determine whether a word came directly from Catalan (as opposed to Occitan), the following are likely to be such examples:
* – &quot;to notice, realise&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese )
* – &quot;to be embarrassed&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to moisten, soak&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese &quot;to shower&quot;)
* – &quot;growth, development&quot; (from )
* – &quot;handkerchief&quot; (from ; but also French ) (cognate of Maltese )
* – &quot;to be pleased&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to look at somebody/something&quot; (from ; but also Arabic ).
* &quot;fardali&quot; – &quot;apron&quot; (from &quot;faldar&quot;) (cognate of Maltese &quot;fardal&quot;)

=== Spanish period to the modern age ===
By the time the crowns of Castille and Aragon were united in the late 15th century, the Hispanicisation and Italianisation of written Sicilian in the parliamentary and court records had commenced. By 1543 this process was virtually complete, with the Tuscan dialect of Italian becoming the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Italian peninsula and supplanting written Sicilian.

Spanish rule had hastened this process in two important ways:
* Unlike the Aragonese, almost immediately the Spanish placed viceroys on the Sicilian throne. In a sense, the diminishing prestige of the Sicilian kingdom reflected the decline of Sicilian from an official, written language to eventually a spoken language amongst a predominantly illiterate population.
* The expulsion of all Jews from Spanish dominions that began in 1492 altered the population of Sicily. Not only did the population decline, many of whom were involved in important educated industries, but some of these Jewish families had been in Sicily for around 1,500 years, and Sicilian was their native language, which they used in their schools. Thus the seeds of a possible broad-based education system utilising books written in Sicilian were lost.

Spanish rule lasted over three centuries (not counting the Aragonese and Bourbon periods on either side) and had a significant influence on the Sicilian vocabulary. The following words are of Spanish derivation:
* – &quot;to return home&quot; (from ; but also Catalan )
* / – &quot;scales&quot; (from )
* – &quot;arrow&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese )
* – &quot;lament, annoyance&quot; (from )
* – &quot;brush&quot; (from ) (cognate of Maltese )
* – &quot;receipt&quot; (from )
* – &quot;to be frightened&quot; (crossover of local with Spanish )
* / – &quot;solitude&quot; (from )

Since the Italian Unification (the Risorgimento of 1860–1861), the Sicilian language has been significantly influenced by (Tuscan) Italian. During the Fascist period it became obligatory that Italian be taught and spoken in all schools, whereas up to that point, Sicilian had been used extensively in schools. This process has quickened since World War II due to improving educational standards and the impact of mass media, such that increasingly, even within the family home, Sicilian is not necessarily the language of choice. The Sicilian Regional Assembly voted to make the teaching of Sicilian a part of the school curriculum at primary school level, but as of 2007 only a fraction of schools teach Sicilian. There is also little in the way of mass media offered in Sicilian. The combination of these factors means that the Sicilian language continues to adopt Italian vocabulary and grammatical forms to such an extent that many Sicilians themselves cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect Sicilian language usage.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Sicilian has a number of consonant sounds that set it apart from the other major Romance languages, notably its retroflex consonants.

* &quot;ḌḌ&quot;/&quot;DD&quot; — The retroflex phoneme // (usually geminated or long [ɖː]) is normally the result of the evolution of Latin -&quot;ll&quot;-. This sound is rare but present among Romance languages, including Sardinian, Southern Corsican, and some dialects of Calabria. Similar but not identical sounds are also found in the rest of the Extreme Southern Italian dialect group. The older [lː] sequence is retained in some dialects, while the pronunciation of this phoneme as dental [dː] is increasingly common. Traditionally in Sicilian, the sound was written as &quot;-đđ-&quot;, and in more contemporary usage &quot;-dd-&quot; has been used. It is also often found written &quot;-ddh-&quot; or &quot;-ddr-&quot; (both of which are often considered confusing, as they may also represent and , respectively). In the Cademia Siciliana orthographical proposal as well as the Vocabolario siciliano descriptive orthography, the digraph &quot;-ḍḍ-&quot; is used. For example, the counterpart to Italian in Sicilian is .
* &quot;DR&quot; and &quot;TR&quot; — The Sicilian pronunciation of the digraphs &quot;-dr-&quot; and &quot;-tr-&quot; is and , or even , . If they are preceded by a nasal consonant, &quot;n&quot; is then a retroflex nasal sound .
*&quot;GHI&quot; and &quot;CHI&quot; — The two digraphs -&quot;gh&quot;- and -&quot;ch&quot;-, when occurring before front vowel sounds &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot; or a semivowel &quot;j&quot;, can be pronounced as palatal stops and . From Italian, in place of -&quot;gl&quot;-, a geminated trigraph -- is used and is pronounced as . When -- is geminated, -- it can be pronounced as .
* &quot;RR&quot; — The digraph &quot;-rr-&quot;, depending on the variety of Sicilian, can be a long trill (hereafter transcribed without the length mark) or a voiced retroflex sibilant . This innovation is also found under slightly different circumstances in Polish, where it is spelled &quot;-rz-&quot;, and in some Northern Norwegian dialects, where speakers vary between and . At the beginning of a word, the single letter &quot;r&quot; is similarly always pronounced double, though this is not indicated orthographically. This phenomenon, however, does not include words that start with a single &quot;r&quot; resulting from rhotacism or apheresis (see below), which should not be indicated orthographically to avoid confusion with regular double &quot;r&quot;.
* Voiced &quot;S&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; — The and sounds are voiced as and when after or other voiced sounds. In the Sicilian digraphs &quot;-sb-&quot; and &quot;-sv-&quot;, becomes voiced and palatalized as a voiced post-alveolar fricative along with the voiced sounds /, /.
* &quot;STR&quot; and &quot;SDR&quot; — The Sicilian trigraphs &quot;-str-&quot; and &quot;-sdr-&quot; are or , and or . The &quot;t&quot; is not pronounced at all and there is a faint whistle between the &quot;s&quot; and the &quot;r&quot;, producing a similar sound to the &quot;shr&quot; of English , or how some English speakers pronounce &quot;frustrated&quot;. The voiced equivalent is somewhat similar to how some English speakers might pronounce the phrase &quot;was driving&quot;.
* Latin &quot;FL&quot; — The other unique Sicilian sound is found in those words that have been derived from Latin words containing &quot;-fl-&quot;. In standard literary Sicilian, the sound is rendered as &quot;-ci-&quot; (representing the voiceless palatal fricative ), e.g. (&quot;river&quot;, from Latin ), but can also be found in written forms such as &quot;-hi-&quot;, , &quot;-çi-&quot;, or erroneously &quot;-sci-&quot;.
* Consonantal lenition — A further range of consonantal sound shifts occurred between the Vulgar Latin introduced to the island following Roman rule and the subsequent development of the Sicilian language. These sound shifts include: Latin &quot;-nd-&quot; to Sicilian &quot;-nn-&quot;; Latin &quot;-mb-&quot; to Sicilian &quot;-mm-&quot;; Latin &quot;-pl-&quot; to Sicilian &quot;-chi-&quot;; and Latin &quot;-li-&quot; to Sicilian &quot;-gghi-&quot;.
* Rhotacism and apheresis — This transformation is characterized by the substitution of single &quot;d&quot; by &quot;r&quot;. In Sicilian this is produced by a single flap of the tongue against the upper alveolar ridge . This phenomenon is known as rhotacism, that is, the substitution of &quot;r&quot; for another consonant; it is commonly found both in Eastern and Western Sicilian, and elsewhere in Southern Italy, especially in Neapolitan. It can occur internally, or it can affect initial &quot;d&quot;, in which case it should not be represented orthographically to avoid confusion with the regular &quot;r&quot; (see above). Examples : (&quot;foot&quot;) is pronounced ; (&quot;Virgin Mary&quot;) is pronounced ; (&quot;to say it&quot;) is pronounced . Similarly, apheresis of some clusters may occur in certain dialects, producing instances such as for &quot;big&quot;.
* &quot;NG&quot; — The digraph &quot;-ng-&quot;, depending on the variety of Sicilian, can be a or a . It is found in the word &quot;sangu&quot; (&quot;blood&quot;).
* &quot;Ï&quot; — The Sicilian letter ï indicates that the unstressed i is not a semivowel with the following vowel. It is found in the word &quot;pistïari&quot; (pejorative of eat).

=== Vowels ===
Sicilian has five phonemic vowels: , , , , . The mid-vowels and do not occur in unstressed position in native words but may do so in modern borrowings from Italian, English, or other languages. Historically, Sicilian and each represent the confluence of three Latin vowels (or four in unstressed position), hence their high frequency.

Unstressed and generally undergo reduction to and respectively, except in word-/phrase-final position, as in ‘possible’ and ‘rabbit’.

As in Italian, vowels are allophonically lengthened in stressed open syllables.

==== Omission of initial &quot;i&quot; ====
In the vast majority of instances in which the originating word had an initial , Sicilian has dropped it completely. That has also happened when there was once an initial and, to a lesser extent, and : &quot;important&quot;, &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;enemy&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;to illustrate&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;American&quot;.

=== Gemination and contractions ===
In Sicilian, gemination is distinctive for most consonant phonemes, but a few can be geminated only after a vowel: , , , , and . Rarely indicated in writing, spoken Sicilian also exhibits syntactic gemination (or ), which means that the first consonant of a word is lengthened when it is preceded by words like - meaning ‘it is, but, and, to, of, for, what’. For instance in the phrase ‘it&#x27;s good’, there is a doubled in pronunciation.

The letter at the start of a word can have two separate sounds depending on what precedes the word. For instance, in (&quot;day&quot;), it is pronounced . However, after a nasal consonant or if it is triggered by syntactic gemination, it is pronounced as in with or (&quot;three days&quot;) with .

Another difference between the written and the spoken languages is the extent to which contractions occur in everyday speech. Thus a common expression such as (&quot;we have to go and buy...&quot;) is generally reduced to in talking to family and friends.

The circumflex accent is commonly used in denoting a wide range of contractions in the written language, particularly the joining of simple prepositions and the definite article: = (&quot;of the&quot;), = (&quot;to the&quot;), = (&quot;for the&quot;), = (&quot;in the&quot;), etc.

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns and adjectives ===
Most feminine nouns and adjectives end in &quot;-a&quot; in the singular: (&#x27;house&#x27;), (&#x27;door&#x27;), (&#x27;paper&#x27;). Exceptions include (&#x27;sister&#x27;) and (&#x27;fig&#x27;). The usual masculine singular ending is &quot;-u&quot;: (&#x27;man&#x27;), (&#x27;book&#x27;), (&#x27;name&#x27;). The singular ending &quot;-i&quot; can be either masculine or feminine.

Unlike Standard Italian, Sicilian uses the same standard plural ending &quot;-i&quot; for both masculine and feminine nouns and adjectives: (&#x27;houses&#x27; or &#x27;cases&#x27;), (&#x27;doors&#x27; or &#x27;harbors&#x27;), (&#x27;tables&#x27;). Some masculine plural nouns end in &quot;-a&quot; instead, a feature that is derived from the Latin neuter endings &quot;-um, -a&quot;: (&#x27;books&#x27;), (&#x27;days&#x27;), (&#x27;arms&#x27;, compare Italian &quot;braccio&quot;, &quot;braccia&quot;), (&#x27;gardens&#x27;), (&#x27;writers&#x27;), (&#x27;signs&#x27;). Some nouns have irregular plurals: &quot;omu&quot; has (compare Italian &quot;uomo&quot;, &quot;uomini&quot;), (&#x27;game&#x27;) (Italian &quot;gioco&quot;, &quot;giochi&quot;) and (&quot;bed&quot;) (Italian &quot;letto&quot;, &quot;&#x27;letti&quot;). Three feminine nouns are invariable in the plural: (&#x27;hand[s]&#x27;), (&#x27;fig[s]&#x27;) and (&#x27;sister[s]&#x27;).

=== Verbs ===
==== Verb &quot;to have&quot; ====
Sicilian has only one auxiliary verb, , &#x27;to have&#x27;. It is also used to denote obligation (e.g. , &#x27;[he/she] has to go&#x27;), and to form the future tense, as Sicilian for the most part no longer has a synthetic future tense: , &#x27;[he/she] will sing&#x27;.

==== Verb &quot;to go&quot; and the periphrastic future ====
As in English and like most other Romance languages, Sicilian may use the verb , &#x27;to go&#x27;, to signify the act of being about to do something. , &#x27;I&#x27;m going to sing&#x27;. In this way, + + infinitive can also be a way to form the simple future construction.

==== Tenses and moods ====
The main conjugations in Sicilian are illustrated below with the verb , &#x27;to be&#x27;.

# The synthetic future is rarely used and, as Camilleri explains, continues its decline towards complete disuse. Instead, the following methods are used to express the future:
#: 1) the use of the present indicative, which is usually preceded by an adverb of time:
#:: — &#x27;This evening I go to the theatre&#x27;; or, using a similar English construction, &#x27;This evening I am going to the theatre&#x27;
#:: — &#x27;Tomorrow I [will] write to you&#x27;
#: 2) the use of a compound form consisting of the appropriate conjugation of (&#x27;have to&#x27;) in combination with the infinitive form of the verb in question:
#:: — &#x27;This evening I will [/must] go to the theatre&#x27;
#:: — &#x27;Tomorrow I will [/must] write to you&#x27;
#:: In speech, the contracted forms of &quot;aviri&quot; often come into play:
#::: — &#x27;Tomorrow I will [/must] write to you&#x27;.
# The synthetic conditional has also fallen into disuse (except for the dialect spoken in Messina, ). The conditional has two tenses:
#: 1) the present conditional, which is replaced by either:
#:: i) the present indicative:
#::: — &quot;I [would] call her if you [would] give me her number&#x27;, or
#:: ii) the imperfect subjunctive:
#::: — &#x27;I&#x27;d call her if you would give me her number&#x27;; and
#: 2) the past conditional, which is replaced by the pluperfect subjunctive:
#::: — &#x27;I&#x27;d have gone if you would have told me where it is&#x27;
#: In a hypothetical statement, both tenses are replaced by the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive:
#::: — &#x27;If I were rich I would buy a palace&#x27;
#::: — &#x27;If I had worked I would not have suffered misery&#x27;.
# The second-person singular (polite) uses the older form of the present subjunctive, such as , which has the effect of softening it somewhat into a request, rather than an instruction. The second-person singular and plural forms of the imperative are identical to the present indicative, exception for the second-person singular &quot;-ari&quot; verbs, whose ending is the same as for the third-person singular: .

== Literature ==
Extracts from three of Sicily&#x27;s more celebrated poets are offered below to illustrate the written form of Sicilian over the last few centuries: Antonio Veneziano, Giovanni Meli and Nino Martoglio.

A translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer can also be found in J. K. Bonner. This is written with three variations: a standard literary form from the island of Sicily and a southern Apulian literary form.

Luigi Scalia translated the biblical books of Ruth, Song of Solomon and the Gospel of Matthew into Sicilian. These were published in 1860 by Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte.

== Influence on Italian ==

As one of the most spoken languages of Italy, Sicilian has notably influenced the Italian lexicon. In fact, there are several Sicilian words that are now part of the Italian language and usually refer to things closely associated to Sicilian culture, with some notable exceptions:
* (from ): a Sicilian cuisine specialty;
* (from ): to joke;
* (from ): a cheese typical of Sicily;
* (from ): a Sicilian pastry;
* (from ): razor clam;
* (from ): butcher&#x27;s shop;
* (from ): boy, especially a Sicilian one;
* : a Sicilian pastry;
* (from ): a small breed of dogs common in Sicily;
* : a small group of criminals affiliated to the Sicilian mafia;
* (from ): watchman in a farm, with a yearly contract;
* (from ): stony habitation typical of the island of Pantelleria;
* (from ): illegal exchange of goods or favours, but in a wider sense also cheat, intrigue;
* (from ): Jew&#x27;s harp;
* (from ): quick variation of sea level produced by a store of water in the coasts as a consequence of either wind action or an atmospheric depression;
* : penis in its original meaning, but also stupid person; is also widely used as interjection to show either astonishment or rage;
* (from ): young man, but also the lowest grade in the Mafia hierarchy;
* (from ): small piece of paper, especially used for secret criminal communications;
* (from , literally meaning &quot;beak&quot;, from the saying &quot;to wet one&#x27;s beak&quot;): protection money paid to the Mafia;
* (onomatopoeia?; &quot;the duck wants a say&quot;): person devoid of value, nonentity;
* (from , literally &quot;to move home&quot;): to leave en masse;
* (equivalent to Italian ): lower Mafia organization.

== Use today ==
=== Sicily ===
Sicilian is estimated to have 5,000,000 speakers. However, it remains very much a home language that is spoken among peers and close associates. Regional Italian has encroached on Sicilian, most evidently in the speech of the younger generations.

In terms of the written language, it is mainly restricted to poetry and theatre in Sicily. The education system does not support the language, despite recent legislative changes, as mentioned previously. Local universities either carry courses in Sicilian or describe it as , the study of dialects.

=== Calabria ===
The dialect of Reggio Calabria is spoken by some 260,000 speakers in the Reggio Calabria metropolitan area. It is recognised, along with the other Calabrian dialects, by the regional government of Calabria by a law promulgated in 2012 that protects Calabria&#x27;s linguistic heritage.

=== Diaspora ===
Outside Sicily and Southern Calabria, there is an extensive Sicilian-speaking diaspora living in several major cities across South and North America and in other parts of Europe and Australia, where Sicilian has been preserved to varying degrees.

=== Media ===
The Sicilian-American organization Arba Sicula publishes stories, poems and essays, in Sicilian with English translations, in an effort to preserve the Sicilian language, in &quot;Arba Sicula&quot;, its bi-lingual annual journal (latest issue: 2017), and in a biennial newsletter entitled &quot;Sicilia Parra&quot;.

The movie &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; (1948) is entirely in Sicilian and uses many local amateur actors.

The nonprofit organisation Cademia Siciliana publishes a Sicilian version of a quarterly magazine, &quot;UNESCO Courier&quot;.

<text>The House of Representatives was the lower chamber of Fiji&#x27;s Parliament from 1970 to 2006. It was the more powerful of the two chambers; it alone had the power to initiate legislation (the Senate, by contrast, could amend or veto most legislation, but could not initiate it). The House of Representatives also had much greater jurisdiction over financial bills; the Senate could not amend them, although it might veto them. Except in the case of amendments to the Constitution, over which a veto of the Senate was absolute, the House of Representatives might override a Senatorial veto by passing the same bill a second time, in the parliamentary session immediately following the one in which it was rejected by the Senate, after a minimum period of six months.

Also, the Prime Minister and Cabinet were required to retain the confidence of a majority of the House of Representatives to remain in office.

The House of Representatives was suspended by the 2006 military coup. The 2013 Constitution abolished it and replaced it with a single chamber Parliament.

== History ==
The House of Representatives dated from 10 October 1970, when Fiji attained independence from the United Kingdom. Under a grandfather clause in the 1970 Constitution, the old Legislative Council, which had functioned in various forms since 1904, was renamed the House of Representatives and continued in office until 1972, when the first post-independence elections were held. Membership of the House of Representatives was increased from 36 to 52 in 1972, and to 70 in 1992. By the time of its suspension and abolition it had 71 members, all of whom were elected for five-year terms to represent single-member constituencies.

== Electoral system ==
* &quot;See main articles: Electoral system of Fiji, Voting system of Fiji&quot;

The electoral system was changed a number of times after independence in an effort to meet the competing demands of Fiji&#x27;s diverse ethnic communities. In elections from 1972 through 1987, Fiji was divided into &quot;communal&quot; and &quot;national&quot; constituencies. The former were elected by voters registered as members of specific ethnic groups (12 indigenous Fijians, 12 Indo-Fijians, and 3 General electors – Caucasians, Chinese, and other minorities); the latter were allocated to specific ethnic groups (10 indigenous Fijians, 10 Indo-Fijians, and 5 General Electors), but elected by universal suffrage. The system was a compromise between indigenous demands for a strictly communal franchise (based on fears of being swamped by an Indo-Fijian block-vote) and Indo-Fijian calls for universal suffrage, and was never widely popular. Ethnic Fijian nationalists blamed the national constituencies for the election of an Indo-Fijian dominated government in 1987, and following two military coups, they were abolished by the new republican Constitution of 1990.

The elections of 1992 and 1994 saw all 70 members elected from communal constituencies; this system was widely resented by many Indo-Fijians, who complained that only 27 seats were allocated to them as opposed to 37 to ethnic Fijians, despite the near equality of their numbers at that time. A further 5 seats were allocated to minority groups.

A constitutional review in 1997 introduced a new system, with 71 members. 25 were elected by universal suffrage from Open constituencies (&quot;open&quot; meaning that the franchise was open to all locally resident Fijian citizens, irrespective of their ethnic background), with the remaining 46 elected from communal constituencies, with 23 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians, 19 for Indo-Fijians, 1 for Rotuman Islanders, and 3 for &quot;General Electors&quot; – Europeans, Chinese, Banaban Islanders, and other minorities. Every Fijian citizen eligible to vote thus had two votes – one for an open electorate, and one for a communal electorate. The system remained controversial, however.

The &quot;open constituencies&quot; differed from the former &quot;national constituencies&quot; in that while both comprised all registered voters on a common voters&#x27; roll, regardless of race, the open constituencies might be contested by members of any ethnic group whereas the national constituencies were ethnically allocated.

== Organization ==
At its first session following a general election, the House of Representatives would elect a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker. With a view to ensuring impartiality, the Speaker was not allowed to be a member of the House, though he was required to qualify for membership. The Deputy Speaker, however, was elected from among members of the House.

<doc id="467208" wikidata="Q662322" url="?curid=467208" title="Third ventricle">
<text>The third ventricle is one of the four connected cerebral ventricles of the ventricular system within the mammalian brain. It is a slit-like cavity formed in the diencephalon between the two thalami, in the midline between the right and left lateral ventricles, and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Running through the third ventricle is the interthalamic adhesion, which contains thalamic neurons and fibers that may connect the two thalami.

==Structure==

The third ventricle is a narrow, laterally flattened, vaguely rectangular region, filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and lined by ependyma. It is connected at the superior anterior corner to the lateral ventricles, by the interventricular foramina, and becomes the cerebral aqueduct (&quot;aqueduct of Sylvius&quot;) at the posterior caudal corner. Since the interventricular foramina are on the lateral edge, the corner of the third ventricle itself forms a bulb, known as the &quot;anterior recess&quot; (it is also known as the &quot;bulb of the ventricle&quot;). The roof of the ventricle comprises choroid plexus, forming the inferior central portion of the tela choroidea; immediately above the superior central portion of the tela choroidea is the fornix.

The lateral side of the ventricle is marked by a sulcus – the hypothalamic sulcus – from the inferior side of the interventricular foramina to the anterior side of the cerebral aqueduct. The lateral border posterior/superior of the sulcus constitutes the thalamus, while anterior/inferior of the sulcus it constitutes the hypothalamus. The interthalamic adhesion usually tunnels through the thalamic portion of the ventricle, joining together the left and right halves of the thalamus, although it is sometimes absent, or split into more than one tunnel through the ventricle; it is currently unknown whether any nerve fibres pass between the left and right thalamus via the adhesion (it has more resemblance to a herniation than a commissure).

The posterior border of the ventricle primarily constitutes the epithalamus. The superior part of the posterior border constitutes the habenular commissure, while more centrally it the pineal gland, which regulates sleep and reacts to light levels. Caudal of the pineal gland is the posterior commissure; nerve fibres reach the posterior commissure from the adjacent midbrain, but their onward connection is currently uncertain. The commissures create concavity to the shape of the posterior ventricle border, causing the suprapineal recess above the habenular, and the deeper pineal recess between the habenular and posterior commissures; the recesses being so-named due to the pineal recess being bordered by the pineal gland.

The anterior wall of the ventricle forms the lamina terminalis, within which the vascular organ monitors and regulates the osmotic concentration of the blood; the cerebrum lies beyond the lamina, and causes it to have a slightly concave shape. The optic recess – marks the inferior end of the lamina terminalis, with the optic chiasm forming the immediately adjacent floor.

The portion of the floor immediately posterior of the optic chiasm distends inferiorly, and slightly anteriorly, to form a funnel (the infundibulum); the recess leading to the funnel is known as the infundibular recess. The border of the funnel is the tuber cinereum, which constitutes a bundle of nerve fibres from the hypothalamus. The funnel ends in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, which is thus neurally connected to the hypothalamus via the tuber cinereum. A venous sinus (the &quot;circular sinus&quot;) surrounds the superior portion of the tuber cinereum; the &quot;circular sinus&quot; is in fact simply a portion of the two lateral cavernous sinuses, joined together by a posterior and anterior &quot;intercavernous&quot; sinus.

The mammillary bodies form the floor posterior of the tuber cinereum, acting as the link between the fornix and the hypothalamus. Posterior of the mamillary bodies, the ventricle becomes the opening of the cerebral aqueduct, the inferior borders becoming the crus cerebri (sometimes historically called the &quot;cerebral peduncle&quot;) of the midbrain.

==Development==

The third ventricle, like other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develops from the &quot;neural canal&quot; of the neural tube. Specifically, it originates from the most rostral portion of the neural tube which initially expands to become the prosencephalon. The lamina terminalis is the rostral termination of the neural tube. After about five weeks, different portions of the prosencephalon begin to take distinct developmental paths from one another – the more rostral portion becomes the telencephalon, while the more caudal portion becomes the diencephalon. The telencephalon gradually expands laterally to a much greater extent than it does dorsally or ventrally, and its connection to the remainder of the neural tube reduces to the interventricula foramina. The diencephalon expands more evenly, but caudally of the diencephalon the canal remains narrow. The third ventricle is the space formed by the expanding canal of the diencephalon.

The hypothalamic region of the ventricle develops from the ventral portion of the neural tube, while the thalamic region develops from the dorsal portion; the wall of the tube thickens and becomes the hypothalamus and thalamus respectively. The hypothalamic area of the ventricle begins to distend ventrally during the 5th week of development, creating the infundibulum and posterior pituitary; an outgrowth from the stomodeum (the future mouth) gradually extends towards it, to form the anterior pituitary.

The optic recess is noticeable by the end of the 6th week, by which time a bend is distinguishable in the dorsal portion of the ventricle border. Rostral of the bend, the medial dorsal portion of the ventrical begins to flatten, and become secretory (i.e. choroid plexus), forming the roof of the ventricle. Caudal of the bend, the ventricle border forms the epithalamus, and begins to distend towards the parietal bone (in lower vertebrates, it distends more specifically to the parietal eye); the border of the distention forms the pineal gland.

==Clinical significance==
The floor of the third ventricle is formed by hypothalamic structures and this can be opened surgically between the mamillary bodies and the pituitary gland in a procedure called an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy can be performed in order to release extra fluid caused by hydrocephalus.

Several studies have found evidence of ventricular enlargement to be associated with major depression, particularly enlargement of the third ventricle. These observations are interpreted as indicating a loss of neural tissue in brain regions adjacent to the enlarged ventricle, leading to suggestions that cytokines and related mediators of neurodegeneration may play a role in giving rise to the disease.

A chordoid glioma is a rare tumour that can arise in the third ventricle.

<doc id="467209" wikidata="Q7016487" url="?curid=467209" title="New security concept">
<text>The new security concept (新安全观) is a security policy enunciated by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the late 1990s. The concept is that in the post-Cold War period, nations are able to increase their security through diplomatic and economic interaction, and that the Cold war mentality of competing and antagonistic blocs is outdated. Around 2002 and 2003, this security policy seemed to merge with the foreign policy doctrine known as China&#x27;s peaceful rise.

The overarching principle of the new security concept is that no single state, even the most powerful, is capable of coping with all security challenges alone.

The new security concept has influenced a number of Chinese foreign policies in the 1990s and early 21st century, including better relations with ASEAN, the formation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Russian Federation with Russia, as well as joint efforts with the United States to control nuclear proliferation in North Korea.

<text>Magnatune is an American independent record label based in Berkeley, California, founded in spring 2003. It only sold music for download through its website but added a print-CD-on-demand service in late 2004 and in September 2007 began selling complete albums and individual tracks through Amazon.com. In May 2008, Magnatune launched all-you-can-eat membership plans. From March 2010 Magnatune dropped the CD printing service and moved exclusively to all-you-can-eat membership plans. Magnatune was the first record label to license music online and as of May 2015 had sold over 7,000 licenses in its twelve years of existence.

In 2024, Magnatune announced that it was no longer offering new subscriptions or licenses, or trading of any kind. However, some music would still be available for free, via its site to listen to. 

==Overview==
Magnatune makes non-exclusive agreements with artists and gives them 50% of any proceeds from online sales or licensing. These kinds of policies were very unusual for a record label in 2003–2004. Users can stream or download music in MP3 format (no DRM) without charge before choosing whether to buy or not. (Some MP3s available for free download have Magnatune advertisements in them.) Buyers used to be able to purchase individual albums and choose their own price, from US$5 to $18 per album, but in March 2010 Magnatune moved to a subscriptions-only business model, where buyers have to purchase a monthly subscription (with a three-month minimum) under which they can download as much music as they like from Magnatune. Customers may download music they have purchased in WAV, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis and AAC encoding formats. Music files sold by Magnatune do not use any form of digital rights management to prevent customers from making copies of music files they have purchased; Magnatune encourages buyers to share up to three copies with friends.

All of the tracks downloaded free of charge are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License. Even though using liberal licensing is not a new idea in itself, Magnatune is one of the first companies to try to build a business in music around this idea.

===Founder===
John Buckman is founder of Magnatune. In 1994, Buckman and his ex-wife Jan Hanford founded Lyris Technologies. Buckman was CEO and primary programmer of Lyris&#x27; product line: Lyris ListServer, MailShield, and MailEngine. He sold the company in June 2005. In August 2006, he launched the for-profit corporation BookMooch, an online community for the exchange of used books, which—in combination with his work with Magnatune—has associated Buckman with the Free Culture movement. In September 2007, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and in February 2010 was appointed chairman of the board. In April 2015 Buckman launched Decent Espresso, a company that is designing a new home espresso machine.

Buckman is the co-author of an article in SysAdmin Magazine (later acquired by Dr. Dobbs) entitled &quot;Which OS is Fastest for High-Performance Network Applications?&quot; and the author of an article in Linux Journal entitled &quot;Magnatune, an Open Music Experiment.&quot;

==Integration with media players==
Magnatune has an XML API that has made integration within media players possible. Amarok (from version 1.4.4, released in October 2006) allows users to preview and buy music from all signed artists from within the application. Rhythmbox 0.9.7 added this functionality in December 2006. A Slim Devices plugin for Logitech Media Server is available. A plugin for Songbird is also available. Clementine added support for Magnatune in version 0.4.

<text>Hu Shuli (; born 1953) is the founder and publisher of Caixin Media. She is also the professor of the School of Journalism and Communication at Sun Yat-sen University and the adjunct professor of the School of Journalism and Communication at Renmin University of China.

The first issue of &quot;Century Weekly&quot; under the aegis of Caixin Media was published on January 4, 2010.

Hu serves as a member of the International Media Council of the World Economic Forum.

==Early life==
Hu Shuli was born in Beijing. Her grandfather, Hu Zhongchi, was a translator and editor at &quot;Shen Bao&quot; and his older brother Hu Yuzhi (1896–1986), &quot;an early proponent of language reform, the use of Esperanto, and realism in literature,&quot; was involved in editing and publishing. Her mother, Hu Lingsheng, was a senior editor at &quot;Workers&#x27; Daily&quot;. Her father, Cao Qifeng, had a midlevel post in a trade union. Hu also has an older sister named Cao Zuoya (曹佐雅), who studied in San Diego State University.

Hu Shuli attended Beijing&#x27;s prestigious 101 Middle School. When college classes resumed in 1978, she won entrance to the Renmin University of China (People&#x27;s University of China), from which she graduated in journalism in 1982. She studied development economics as a Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University in 1994. In 2002, she earned an EMBA through a joint program between Fordham University and the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University.

== Career ==
Before &quot;Caijing&quot;, she was working as assistant editor, reporter and international editor at the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Daily&quot;, China&#x27;s second largest newspaper. She joined &quot;China Business Times&quot; in 1992 as international editor and became chief reporter in 1995, resigning in 1998 to start &quot;Caijing&quot;. In addition, Hu served as financial news chief for Phoenix TV in 2001.

She is author of several books, including &quot;New Financial Time&quot;, &quot;Reform Bears No Romance&quot; and &quot;The Scenes Behind American Newspapers&quot;. 

She was a Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford in 1994. She was awarded the 2003 International Editor of the Year by the &quot;World Press Review&quot; and the 2007 Louis Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism by the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University. 

She was the founder of &quot;Caijing&quot; magazine in 1998. In November 2009, Hu Shuli resigned from &quot;Caijing&quot; along with 90 percent of &quot;Caijing&quot;&#x27;s journalists, barely a few weeks after the resignation of Daphne Wu Chuanhui and nearly 70 employees from the business department, and created the breakthrough new media group, Caixin Media and acted as editor-in-chief. Diane Vacca quoted Chinese blogger Hecaitou: &quot;She&#x27;s got blood on her blade, and her clothing smells of gunpowder.”

<text>Voronezh ( ; , ) is a city and the administrative centre of Voronezh Oblast in southwestern Russia straddling the Voronezh River, located from where it flows into the Don River. The city sits on the Southeastern Railway, which connects western Russia with the Urals and Siberia, the Caucasus and Ukraine, and the M4 highway (Moscow–Voronezh–Rostov-on-Don–Novorossiysk). In recent years the city has experienced rapid population growth, rising in 2021 to 1,057,681, up from 889,680 recorded in the 2010 Census, making it the 14th-most populous city in the country.

==History==
===Foundation and name===
The first chronicle references to the word &quot;Voronezh&quot; are dated 1177, when the Ryazan prince Yaropolk, having lost the battle, fled &quot;to Voronozh&quot; and there was moving &quot;from town to town&quot;. Modern data of archeology and history interpret Voronezh as a geographical region, which included the Voronezh river (tributary of the Don) and a number of settlements. In the lower reaches of the river, a unique Slavic town-planning complex of the 8th – early 11th century was discovered, which covered the territory of the present city of Voronezh and its environs (about 42 km long, about 13 forts and many unfortified villages). By the 12th – 13th centuries, most of the old towns were desolate, but new settlements appeared upstream, closer to Ryazan.

For many years, the hypothesis of the Soviet historian Vladimir Zagorovsky dominated: he produced the toponym &quot;Voronezh&quot; from the hypothetical Slavic personal name &quot;Voroneg&quot;. This man allegedly gave the name of a small town in the Chernigov Principality (now the village of Voronizh in Ukraine). Later, in the 11th or 12th century, the settlers were able to &quot;transfer&quot; this name to the Don region, where they named the second city Voronezh, and the river got its name from the city. However, now many researchers criticize the hypothesis, since in reality neither the name of &quot;Voroneg&quot; nor the second city was revealed, and usually the names of Russian cities repeated the names of the rivers, but not vice versa.

The linguistic comparative analysis of the name &quot;Voronezh&quot; was carried out by the Khovansky Foundation in 2009. There is an indication of the place names of many countries in Eurasia, which may partly be not only similar in sound, but also united by common Indo-European languages: Varanasi, Varna, Verona, Brno, etc.

A comprehensive scientific analysis was conducted in 2015–2016 by the historian Pavel Popov. His conclusion: &quot;Voronezh&quot; is a probable Slavic macrotoponym associated with outstanding signs of nature, has a root &quot;voron-&quot; (from the proto-Slavic &quot;vorn&quot;) in the meaning of &quot;black, dark&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ezh&quot; &quot;(-azh, -ozh&quot;). It was not “transferred” and in the 8th - 9th centuries it marked a vast territory covered with black forests (oak forests) - from the mouth of the Voronezh river to the Voronozhsky annalistic forests in the middle and upper reaches of the river, and in the west to the Don (many forests were cut down). The historian believes that the main &quot;city&quot; of the early town-planning complex could repeat the name of the region – Voronezh. Now the hillfort is located in the administrative part of the modern city, in the Voronezh upland oak forest. This is one of Europe&#x27;s largest ancient Slavic hillforts, the area of which – more than 9 hectares – 13 times the area of the main settlement in Kyiv before the baptism of Rus.

In it is assumed that the word &quot;Voronezh&quot; means bluing - a technique to increase the corrosion resistance of iron products. This explanation fits well with the proximity to the ancient city of Voronezh of a large iron deposit and the city of Stary Oskol. As well as the name of Voroneț Monastery known for its blue shade. 

Folk etymology claims the name comes from combining the Russian words for raven (&quot;ворон&quot;) and hedgehog (&quot;еж&quot;) into &quot;Воронеж&quot;. According to this explanation two Slavic tribes named after the animals used this combination to name the river which later in turn provided the name for a settlement. There is not believed to be any scientific support for this explanation.

In the 16th century, the Middle Don basin, including the Voronezh river, was gradually conquered by Muscovy from the Nogai Horde (a successor state of the Golden Horde), and the current city of Voronezh was established in 1585 by Feodor I as a fort protecting the Muravsky Trail trade route against the slave raids of the Nogai and Crimean Tatars. The city was named after the river.

===17th to 19th centuries===


In the 17th century, Voronezh gradually evolved into a sizable town.
&quot;Weronecz&quot; is shown on the &quot;Worona&quot; river in Resania in Joan Blaeu&#x27;s map of 1645.
Peter the Great built a dockyard in Voronezh where the Azov Flotilla was constructed for the Azov campaigns in 1695 and 1696. This fleet, the first ever built in Russia, included the first Russian ship of the line, &quot;Goto Predestinatsia&quot;. The Orthodox diocese of Voronezh was instituted in 1682 and its first bishop, Mitrofan of Voronezh, was later proclaimed the town&#x27;s patron saint.
Owing to the Voronezh Admiralty Wharf, for a short time, Voronezh became the largest city of South Russia and the economic center of a large and fertile region. In 1711, it was made the seat of the Azov Governorate, which eventually morphed into the Voronezh Governorate.

In the 19th century, Voronezh was the center of Voronezh Governorate. Manufacturing industry (mills, tallow-melting, butter-making, soap, leather, and other works) as well as bread, cattle, suet, and the hair trade developed in the town. A railway connected Voronezh with Moscow in 1868 and Rostov-on-Don in 1871.

===20th century===
====World War II====
During World War II, Voronezh was the scene of fierce fighting between Soviet and combined Axis troops. The Germans used it as a staging area for their attack on Stalingrad, and made it a key crossing point on the Don River. In June 1941, two BM-13 (Fighting machine #13 &quot;Katyusha&quot;) artillery installations were built at the Voronezh excavator factory. In July, the construction of &quot;Katyushas&quot; was rationalized so that their manufacture became easier and the time of volley repetition was shortened from five minutes to fifteen seconds. More than 300 BM-13 units manufactured in Voronezh were used in a counterattack near Moscow in December 1941. In October 22, 1941, the advance of the German troops prompted the establishment of a defense committee in the city. On November 7, 1941, there was a troop parade, devoted to the anniversary of the October Revolution. Only three such parades were organized that year: in Moscow, Kuybyshev, and Voronezh. In late June 1942, the city was attacked by German and Hungarian forces. In response, Soviet forces formed the Voronezh Front. By July 6, the German army occupied the western river-bank suburbs before being subjected to a fierce Soviet counter-attack. By July 24 the frontline had stabilised along the Voronezh River as the German forces continued southeast into the Great Bend of the Don. The attack on Voronezh represented the first phase of the German Army&#x27;s 1942 campaign in the Soviet Union, codenamed Case Blue.

Until January 25, 1943, parts of the Second German Army and the Second Hungarian Army occupied the western part of Voronezh. During Operation Little Saturn, the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, and the Voronezhsko-Kastornenskoy Offensive, the Voronezh Front exacted heavy casualties on Axis forces. On January 25, 1943, Voronezh was liberated after ten days of combat. During the war the city was almost completely ruined, with 92% of all buildings destroyed.

====Post-war====
By 1950, Voronezh had been rebuilt. Most buildings and historical monuments were repaired. It was also the location of a prestigious Suvorov Military School, a boarding school for young boys who were considered to be prospective military officers, many of whom had been orphaned by war.

In 1950–1960, new factories were established: a tire factory, a machine-tool factory, a factory of heavy mechanical pressing, and others.
In 1968, Serial production of the Tupolev Tu-144 supersonic plane was established at the Voronezh Aviation factory. In October 1977, the first Soviet domestic wide-body plane, Ilyushin Il-86, was built there.

In 1989, TASS published details of an alleged UFO landing in the city&#x27;s park and purported encounters with extraterrestrial beings reported by a number of children. A Russian scientist that was cited in initial TASS reports later told the Associated Press that he was misquoted, cautioning, &quot;Don&#x27;t believe all you hear from TASS,&quot; and &quot;We never gave them part of what they published&quot;, and a TASS correspondent admitted the possibility that some &quot;make-believe&quot; had been added to the TASS story, saying, &quot;I think there is a certain portion of truth, but it is not excluded that there is also fantasizing&quot;.

===21st century===

From 10 to 17 September 2011, Voronezh celebrated its 425th anniversary. The anniversary of the city was given the status of a federal scale celebration that helped attract large investments from the federal and regional budgets for development.

On December 17, 2012, Voronezh became the fifteenth city in Russia with a population of over one million people.

Today Voronezh is the economic, industrial, cultural, and scientific center of the Central Black Earth Region. As part of the annual tradition in the Russian city of Voronezh, every winter the main city square is thematically drawn around a classic literature. In 2020, the city was decorated using the motifs from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s The Nutcracker. In the year of 2021, the architects drew inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; as well as the animation classic &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; from the Soviet Union. The fairy tale replica city will feature the houses of Kai and Gerda, the palace of the snow queen, an ice rink, and illumination.

In June 2023, during the Wagner Group rebellion, forces of the Wagner Group claimed to have taken control of military facilities in the city. Later they were confirmed to have taken the city itself.

On the night of 27 October 2024, during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine launched a drone attack on two distilleries in Voronezh, distilleries that make rocket and aviation fuel and explosives.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
Information about the original urban layout of Voronezh is contained in the &quot;Patrol Book&quot; of 1615. At that time, the city fortress was logged and located on the banks of the Voronezh River. In plan, it was an irregular quadrangle with a perimeter of about 238 meter. inside it, due to lack of space, there was no housing or siege yards, and even the cathedral church was supposed to be taken out. However, at this small fortress there was a large garrison - 666 households of service people. These courtyards were reliably protected by the second line of fortifications by a standing prison on taras with 25 towers covered with earth; behind the prison was a moat, and beyond the moat there were stakes. Voronezh was a typical military settlement (ostrog). In the city prison there were only settlements of military men: Streletskaya, Kazachya, Belomestnaya atamanskaya, Zatinnaya and Pushkarskaya. The posad population received the territory between the ostrog and the river, where the Monastyrskaya settlements (at the Assumption Monastery) was formed. Subsequently, the Yamnaya Sloboda was added to them, and on the other side of the fort, on the Chizhovka Mountain, the Chizhovskaya Sloboda of archers and Cossacks appeared. As a result, the Voronezh settlements surrounded the fortress in a ring. The location of the parish churches emphasized this ring-like and even distribution of settlements: the Ilyinsky Church of the Streletskaya Sloboda, the Pyatnitskaya Cossack and Pokrovskaya Belomestnaya were brought out to the passage towers of the prison. The Nikolskaya Church of the Streletskaya Sloboda was located near the marketplace (and, accordingly, the front facade of the fortress), and the paired ensemble of the Rozhdestvenskaya and Georgievskaya churches of the Cossack Sloboda marked the main street of the city, going from the Cossack Gate to the fortress tower.
===Climate===
Voronezh experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with long, cold winters and warm to hot summers. Winters are slightly milder than in areas further north and east, and snow season last shorter than in these areas.

Voronezh also hosts the Voronezh Malshevo air force base in the southwest of the city, which, according to a Natural Resources Defense Council report, houses nuclear bombers.

===Rail===
Since 1868, there is a railway connection between Voronezh and Moscow. Rail services form a part of the South Eastern Railway of the Russian Railways. Destinations served direct from Voronezh include Moscow, Kyiv, Kursk, Novorossiysk, Sochi, and Tambov.

<text>The Dandenong Ranges (commonly just The Dandenongs) are a set of low mountain ranges in Victoria, Australia, approximately east of the state capital Melbourne. A minor branch of the Great Dividing Range, the Dandenongs consist mostly of rolling hills, rising to at Mount Dandenong, as well as steeply weathered valleys and gullies covered in thick temperate rainforest, predominantly of tall mountain ash trees and dense ferny undergrowth. The namesake Dandenong Creek and most of its left-bank tributaries (particularly the Eumemmerring Creek) originate from headwaters in these mountain ranges. Two of Melbourne&#x27;s most important storage reservoirs, the Cardinia and Silvan Reservoir, are also located within the Dandenongs.

After European settlement in the Port Phillip Bay region, the range was used as a major local source of timber for Melbourne. The ranges were popular with day-trippers from the 1870s onwards. Much of the Dandenongs were protected as parklands as early as 1882, and by 1987 these parklands were amalgamated to form the Dandenong Ranges National Park, which was subsequently expanded in 1997. The range receives light to moderate snowfalls a few times in most years, frequently between late winter and late spring.

Today, The Dandenongs are home to over 100,000 residents and are popular amongst visitors, many of whom stay for the weekend at the various bed &amp; breakfasts throughout the region. The popular Puffing Billy Railway, a heritage steam railway, runs through the hills villages of the eastern Dandenong Ranges.

== Geology and ecology ==
The range is the remains of an extinct volcano last active 373 million years ago. It consists predominantly of Devonian dacite and rhyodacite.

The topography consists of a series of ridges dissected by deeply cut streams. Sheltered gullies in the south of the range are home to temperate rain forest, fern gullies and Mountain Ash forest &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;, whereas the drier ridges and exposed northern slopes are covered by dry sclerophyll forest of stringybarks and box. The entire range is highly prone to bushfires, the most recent of which have been the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires, the 1997 Dandenong Ranges bushfires and small fires during the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009.

A number of watercourses originate in the Dandenongs, these include:
*Cardinia Creek
*Clematis Creek
*Dandenong Creek
*Eumemmerring Creek
*Emerald Creek
*Ferny Creek
*Mast Gully Creek
*Menzies Creek
*Monbulk Creek
*Muddy Creek
*Olinda Creek
*Sassafras Creek
*Sherbrooke Creek
*Stringy Bark Creek
*Wandin Yallock Creek
*Woori Yallock Creek

===Waterfalls===
*Olinda Falls
*Sherbrooke Falls
*Griffith Falls

===Summits===


==Wildlife==

The Dandenong Ranges are home to a variety of native Australian mammal, bird, reptile and invertebrate species. Well-represented bird species include the Sulfur-crested cockatoo, Superb lyrebird, Laughing kookaburra, and Crimson Rosella. Mammals include the Short-beaked echidna, Common wombat, Sugar glider, and Swamp wallaby. Invertebrates include two species of burrowing crayfish.

==Climate==

The Dandenong Ranges&#x27; climate is generally cool and wet, with daily temperature variation generally low, often as low as 1 degree in the winter months. 
Rainfall is fairly uniform through the year, tending to peak between April and October with lower rainfall during January and February. The mean annual rainfall is between 1000 and 1500 mm, increasing with elevation and from west to east. The elevation means that daytime temperatures are typically 4 to 6 °C cooler than the lower suburbs of Melbourne to the west , with temperatures typically lowering by 1 °C for every of elevation. Due to the elevation, upslope fog is common in the winter months. It is significantly cloudier than Melbourne, particularly in winter due to heavy orographic lifting brought about by cold fronts.

As a result of its elevation, snow typically falls one or two times a year at higher elevations, mostly between June and October. A rare summer snow occurred on Christmas Day 2006 . The local region has experienced substantial warming in recent decades and heavy snowfalls which were once common have become rare. The last significant snowfall to affect the Dandenong Ranges was on August 10, 2008, when as much fell at the highest elevations.

A Bureau of Meteorology weather station sits at an elevation of 513 m in the Ferny Creek Reserve in the southern part of the Dandenong Ranges. This weather station replaced one that was previously located on the summit of Dunns Hill.

==History==
The ranges are located near the boundary between the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people&#x27;s territories. The two nations were part of the Kulin alliance and were most often on friendly terms. The mountain range, however, was not often frequented by either nations people as mountainous areas were often considered one of many resting places for various spirits.

In 1938, the aircraft &quot;Kyeema&quot; crashed on the western face of Mount Corhanwarrabul due to heavy fog and poor navigation. Eighteen people died.

==Utilities==
===Transmission towers===
There are several large television transmission towers on various summits that were initially constructed to broadcast TV to Central Victoria
*Channel 10/Channel 0, 204m high—Mount Corhanwarrabul (628m), (highest frequency)
*Channel 9, 131m high—Mount Corhanwarrabul (628m)
*Channel 7, 131m high—Mount Corhanwarrabul (628m), this tower is from interesting design, as it is a partially guyed tower, consisting of a free-standing lattice tower as basement and a guyed mast as pinnacle.
*Channel 2—Ferny Creek Summit (561m) (lowest frequency)
Channel 7, 9 and 10 all transmit from the 204M high &#x27; Ornata Road &#x27; TXA owned tower just to the South of Burke&#x27;s Lookout. This tower also carries some of Melbourne, Victoria&#x27;s commercial FM broadcast services. It also carries DAB+ digital radio services.
Channel 2 services ( ABC, JJJ, emergency services, Govt owned ) transmit from the 130M high Broadcast Australia &#x27; Eyre Road &#x27; tower. This is an interesting tower in that the base is of four legged, freestanding design, while the upper portion is guyed by two sets of three guy cables. This tower is just to the North of Burke&#x27;s Lookout.
Adjacent to the Broadcast Australia tower, is the TXA &#x27; Eyre Road &#x27; standby tower, capable of transmitting 7, 9, and 10 signals in the event of an Ornata Road transmitter/antenna failure. This tower stands at 130M also and is a conventional four legged freestanding design. About 2 km to the North of this group of three towers, stands the original Channel 9 tower, built in 1956 to a height of 69M. This tower, on Observatory Road and adjacent to the Skyhigh lookout and restaurant now carries only some of Melbourne&#x27;s commercial FM broadcast channels.

==Tourism and attractions==
*Scenic drives—popular for many years on the abundance of winding roads throughout the ranges
*Picnics—dedicated picnic areas can be found in Fern Tree Gully Picnic Ground or at One Tree Hill or in Sherbrooke Forest. Emerald Lake Park has a variety of pretty picnic spots with electric barbecues, sheltered areas and water activities. This park with landscaped gardens adjoins the historic Nobelius Heritage Park 
*The various coffee shops and restaurants, bed and breakfasts, craft shops, antique shops and gardens
*Puffing Billy Railway—a narrow-gauge heritage steam railway, from Belgrave, through to Emerald, Cockatoo and ending at Gembrook
*Lookouts &amp; views—There are several locations throughout the ranges that offer excellent views on both sides of the range. On a clear day, features as far as Mount Macedon, the You Yangs and Port Phillip can be seen simultaneously
*Walking &amp; hiking—various tracks and trails are available at a variety of lengths and difficulties. For example; Four Brothers Rocks near Gembrook, Wright Forest near Cockatoo; The Eastern Dandenong Ranges Trail, which runs through Emerald, Cockatoo to Gembrook has a variety of open scenery and dappled woodland trails and at various stages follows the Puffing Billy railway line

Sherbrooke Falls, Sherbrooke
* Cycling—the Dandenong Ranges is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most popular cycling areas. Popular road cycling climbs include the &quot;1 in 20&quot; on the Mountain Highway, &quot;The Wall&quot;, a steeper route between Monbulk and Olinda, and the also-steep &quot;Devil&#x27;s Elbow&quot;, heading north from Upper Ferntree Gully along the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road to Ferny Creek . Also popular for picturesque and leisurely family bike rides is the Eastern Dandenong Ranges Trail, which runs through Emerald, Cockatoo to Gembrook

===Regulations===
Camping is not permitted within the National Park and fire restrictions may apply during the summer months.

<text>William Gillies (1865 – 1932) was a Scottish socialist and nationalist politician. He helped to form the Scots National League, which joined with other bodies to form the National Party of Scotland, which in turn evolved into the Scottish National Party (SNP).

==Biography==
Gillies was born in the Galloway region of Scotland in 1865, but grew up in London. He was interested in Scottish history from an early age and at the age of seventeen he became friend to John Murdoch who was then the editor of &quot;The Highlander&quot;. Gillies became as enthusiastic for the rights of crofters in the Scottish highlands and joined the Highland Land League. He was at this stage in favour of some form of home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom but grew to support Scottish independence instead.

Gillies also began to learn Gaelic and wrote a number of plays in the language, also serving as secretary of the Gaelic Society of London from 1904 to 1905. However he stood down as secretary when the society rejected his proposal that they should campaign to make Gaelic the national language of Scotland.

Gillies, encouraged by Murdoch, also became aware of the developments in the politics of Ireland becoming an ardent supporter of Sinn Féin, associating with prominent figures such as Art O&#x27;Brien who would become the head of the Irish Self Determination League. He supported the Easter Rising of 1916 and was deeply critical of those socialists who refused to support it, along with those in the Scottish Gaelic revival circles who refused to support it.

Gillies formed a friendship with Ruairidh Erskine of Mar contributing articles to his publications, &quot;Guth na Bliadhna&quot; (Voice of the Year) and &quot;Alba&quot;. In 1920 the Scots National League (SNL) was formed and these two men became its principal leaders. Gillies wanted the SNL to reflect the revolutionary aims of the Irish nationalists by then engaged in a war of independence with the British state. He hoped that it would be the organisation which would lead Scotland to independence and revive the Gaelic language. Gillies became a regular contributor to the SNL&#x27;s regular publication &quot;Liberty&quot; (which was in fact in part funded by Sinn Féin).

Gillies was involved in a little-known chapter of Scotland&#x27;s history when he was involved in the establishment of a volunteer force which was ready to use armed force to win Scottish independence. This body (styled &quot;Fianna na hAlba&quot;) abandoned their plans on the advice of the Irish nationalist leadership. Michael Collins, in a letter to Art O&#x27;Brien stated that they were weaker than the Irish nationalist forces at even their weakest point during their war of independence and stated, &quot;they do not appreciate the particular difficulties they are up against&quot;.

In 1926, Gillies became the first editor of the SNL&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Scots Independent&quot;.

Gillies and Erskine led the SNL into the formation of the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in 1928, which was far more moderate than the SNL. This resulted in many SNL members leaving the NPS dissatisfied with their methods. Gillies died in 1932, two years before the NPS evolved into the Scottish National Party (SNP), which at the time was even more moderate than the NPS had been.

==Legacy==
Angus Clark, one of Gillies&#x27; closest friends wrote on hearing of his death, &quot;he has left an example of noble effort, great faith and true devotion to his country.&quot;

Gillies&#x27; granddaughter, Anne Lorne Gillies, is active in politics, contesting the 1999 elections to the European Parliament as an SNP candidate.

<text>The City of Casey is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Casey is Victoria&#x27;s most populous municipality, with a 2021 population of 365,239. It has an area of .

The city is named after Lord Casey, the 16th Governor-General of Australia, and was formed in 1994 by the merger of most of the City of Berwick with parts of the Shire of Cranbourne (including Cranbourne itself), and the Churchill Park Drive estate within the City of Knox.

==Geography==
Casey spreads from the base of the Dandenong Ranges in the north to the shoreline of Western Port in the south. It features a wide variety of geographical features, due to its outer metropolitan location.

The north, in the foothills of the Dandenongs, is primarily made up of large blocks of land used for grazing, with some small vineyards in operation. An Urban Growth Boundary has been in place since 2005 to protect this area from future residential subdivision.

South of Cranbourne is mainly farmland, used for market gardening and grazing. A small number of flower farms exist around Junction Village, along with a large chicken processing plant in Clyde. This green area has now been opened up for housing development, in the areas of Cranbourne East, Clyde and Clyde North.

The southern boundary of the municipality is the Western Port shoreline including the fishing villages of Tooradin, Blind Bight, Warneet and Cannons Creek. Protected marine reserves exist along this coastline and extend into the Mornington Peninsula at Pearcedale.

The Cardinia border of the city is formed for some of the boundary by the Cardinia Creek, which is drained through channels into Western Port at its southern end. The popular Riding of the Bounds event takes place along this border, in recognition of Berwick&#x27;s sister city status with Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland, England.

==Council==
Until 2024, the City of Casey was divided into six wards – Balla Balla, Edrington, Four Oaks, Mayfield, River Gum and Springfield. Voters in Balla Balla Ward elected one councillor and all other wards electing two councillors per ward. The eleven councillors voted each year to elect a mayor.

In February 2020, the Victorian Minister for Local Government, Adem Somyurek, dismissed all Casey councillors following a report from municipal monitor Laurinda Gardner that found significant governance failures at the council. Somyurek then appointed Noelene Duff as interim administrator.

In May 2020 Somyurek appointed Noelene Duff PSM, Cameron Boardman and Miguel Belmar as Council administrator panel, to remain until October 2024.

===Current composition===

The most recent elections were held on 26 October 2024 and elected the following councillors:

<doc id="467230" wikidata="Q4567868" url="?curid=467230" title="Blue Team (U.S. politics)">
<text>The Blue Team is an informal term for a group of politicians and journalists in the United States loosely united by their belief that the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a significant security threat to the United States. Though allied on some issues with Democratic advocates of labor, most of those to whom the term has been applied are conservative or neoconservative.

==Origin and application of the term==
The name comes from the color representing US forces in war games, in contrast to the red that represents the American opponent. It was coined by William Triplett, former counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, and in the context of China&#x27;s economic and military expansion not only in Asia but around the world, &quot;blue&quot; concerns widened in scope.

Though now applied primarily to Republicans, the terms refers to concerns not tied to a single party or perspective. Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992 against George H. W. Bush&#x27;s supposed laxness toward China, but while in office uncoupled economic integration with democratic reform in China.

==Individuals associated with the interpretation==

The original core of the &quot;blue team&quot; was a group of congressional aides who met in an informal study group during the 1990s. Working largely behind the scenes, these aides influenced legislation in subtle and incremental ways. They were involved in attaching to bills riders that forced the State Department to report on human rights abuses and the Defense Department to reveal information it had collected about the Chinese military.

By and large, most high-profile American politicians have not spoken out stridently enough against China to be called members of the Blue Team. Some minor politicians have been closely associated with the group or its ideas. Among them are Christopher Cox, chairman of the commission that produced the Cox Report on Chinese espionage.

The Bush administration had for the most part followed the &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach that has been dominant in US foreign relations since the Shanghai Communiqué, which allows for &quot;engagement&quot; with China. However, more than the Clinton administration, it had been willing to see China as a strategic competitor, and it has been &quot;far more eager...to treat China with suspicion and adopt more hard-nosed policies.&quot;

Still, the dominant voices of the &quot;team&quot; since 2001 have come not from government but from private conservative think tanks and journalists. William Kristol, whose &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; once described the PRC as &quot;a regime of hair-curling, systematic barbarity,&quot; has called repeatedly for a harsher stance against China. Robert Kagan, co-founder of PNAC. Ross H. Munro, and David Blumenthal, and Peter Navarro have all written extensively about the perceived threat posed by China. Navarro&#x27;s 2011 book with Greg Autry, &quot;Death by China&quot;, inspired a 2012 documentary film of the same name directed by Navarro and narrated by Martin Sheen.

The beliefs associated with &quot;Blue Team&quot; opinions arise largely from dissatisfaction with the general drift of American foreign policy toward accommodation with the PRC. The massacre in Tiananmen Square and China&#x27;s later use of a missile test in an attempt to influence Taiwanese voters sharpened fears about China&#x27;s intentions; The more virulent critics of China accused Clinton of appeasement.

For some, China&#x27;s military is the focal point of concern, as it was for the original congressional study group. They point out that China is not only modernizing its army and navy, but it is also hiding its actual military expenditures. They claim that China aspires to dominate the region through, for example, the creation of a blue-water navy, and that such dominance would inevitably endanger US interests and threaten long-time allies Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

==Influence==
As the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia&#x27;s economy and military were still in turmoil, it seemed to some observers logical that China would seek to replace Russia as the main counterbalance to the United States. The &quot;blue&quot; perspective views with alarm China&#x27;s increased military spending and the passing of the Taiwan anti-secession law in 2005. This was of major concern to US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld since the Pentagon had frequently complained about the lack of transparency in China&#x27;s military capabilities and intentions. A recent threat report from the Pentagon reinforced the Blue Team&#x27;s fears, stating that China may be attempting a military buildup aimed at capturing Taiwan and deterring outside help from the US and/or Japan. Finally, though US policy towards North Korea has depended partly on China&#x27;s cooperation, some &quot;hawks&quot; in the US suspect China&#x27;s motives with regards to that country as well.

<text>The City of Port Phillip is a local government area of Victoria, Australia on the northern shores of Port Phillip, south of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district. It has an area of 20.7 km2 and had a population of 109,515 in 2023.

Port Phillip contains a number of varied and substantial retail, entertainment and leisure precincts. These include Bay Street (Port Melbourne), Victoria Avenue (Albert Park), Clarendon Street (South Melbourne), Armstrong Street (Middle Park), Fitzroy Street (St Kilda), Acland Street (St Kilda), Carlisle Street (Balaclava) and Ormond Road (Elwood). A number of significant employment areas lie within Port Phillip, including part of the St Kilda Road business district and industrial, warehousing and manufacturing districts in South Melbourne and Port Melbourne. The city has experienced a significant amount of residential development in the 1990s, particularly in areas close to the foreshore. Port Phillip is well served by public transport with a substantial tram network, the St Kilda and Port Melbourne tram lines and two stations on the Sandringham railway line, in addition to bus services.

Comprising nine single member wards, it is predominantly an amalgamation of three former cities – St Kilda, parts of South Melbourne, most of Port Melbourne, as well as a small portion of Windsor from the former City of Prahran

The city was created with its present borders in June 1994 under the municipal restructure by the state government. It is bounded by White Reserve and Todd Road to the west, the West Gate Freeway, Kings Way and Dorcas Street to the north, St Kilda Road, High Street, Punt Road, Queens Way, Dandenong Road, Orrong Road, Inkerman Street, Hotham Street, Glen Huntly Road, St Kilda Street and Head Street generally to the east and the foreshore of Port Phillip to the south. Adjacent councils include the City of Melbourne, City of Bayside, City of Glen Eira and the City of Stonnington. When first created, the city was administered by three appointed commissioners, headed by Des Clarke. The first council elections were held in March 1996.

Council offices are currently located in the St Kilda Town Hall, Port Melbourne Town Hall and the South Melbourne Town Hall (currently closed for restoration). The council operates several other facilities including local libraries, childcare centres, parks, playgrounds and community centres. In 2020 ANAM was given a long lease to South Melbourne Town Hall and council staff there and a few community groups vacated the building.

<doc id="467247" wikidata="Q1947531" url="?curid=467247" title="City of Merri-bek">
<text>The City of Merri-bek () is a local government area in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. It comprises the inner northern suburbs between 4 and 11 kilometres from the Melbourne CBD. The Merri-bek local government area covers , and in June 2018, it had a population of 181,725.

The local government area was created as the City of Moreland in 1994 during the amalgamations of local governments by the state government, being created from the former local government areas of the City of Brunswick, the City of Coburg and the southern part of the City of Broadmeadows. It was renamed to Merri-bek in September 2022.

In 2004 the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), an independent authority created under Victorian state legislation, conducted a representation review of the council&#x27;s electoral structure, resulting in a recommendation that the 10 single councillor wards be replaced by three multi-councillor wards. A consequence of the change from single-councillor to multi-councillor wards was a change in election method from Instant runoff voting to proportional representation via Single transferable vote. Elections are held every four years.

==Name==
In November 2021, it came to the council&#x27;s attention that Moreland&#x27;s namesake was indirectly associated with a Jamaican plantation site that had traded slaves up to the 1800s. This historical information was contained in the 2010 Moreland Council publication &quot;Thematic History&quot;, and published in books and articles as far back as 1944.

In October 1839, Scottish surgeon and settler Dr Farquhar McCrae was sold land between Moonee Ponds Creek and Sydney Road by the Crown in the area&#x27;s first colonial sale. McCrae gave the land the name Moreland. Some suggest he may have taken this name from a Jamaican sugar plantation that his paternal grandfather Alexander McCrae worked at from the late 1760s to the early 1790s, which was involved in slave trading, and kept up to 500 to 700 enslaved people in the operation in any one year. Greens Mayor Mark Riley said &quot;The history behind the naming of this area is painful, uncomfortable and very wrong. It needs to be addressed&quot;. In May 2022 a choice of three proposed names from the Woi-wurrung language was announced by Riley and Uncle Andrew Gardiner, deputy chair of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation: Wa-dam-buk, meaning “renew”; Merri-bek, meaning “rocky country”; and Jerrang, meaning “leaf of tree”. The names were scheduled to be decided by July 2022 following community consultation.

The community consultation for the renaming commenced in May 2022 and ended June 2022. Some residents expressed dissatisfaction with the process resulting in a petition to council.

On 3 July 2022 (coinciding with the start of NAIDOC Week) the Council voted at a Special Council Meeting to officially endorse Merri-bek as the preferred name. The name was submitted to the Minister for Local Government for consideration and the Minister&#x27;s decision to alter the name was gazetted on 13 September 2022 and came into operation on 26 September.

==Council services==
Merri-bek Council runs the Counihan Gallery at the Brunswick Town Hall, a free public art gallery named after the local artist, Noel Counihan. Other art events supported by Council include the MoreArt event, an art in public spaces show located along the Upfield transport corridor. The council also sponsors various street festivals around the municipality, the best known being the Sydney Road Street Party.

One of the highlights of Merri-bek is its public library. Merri-bek City Libraries has five branches.

Other Merri-bek local government services include maternal and child health service, waste and recycling collection, parks and open space, a youth space called Oxygen, services for children, and aged services.

== Climate action ==
Merri-bek/Moreland Council has been one of the leading municipal councils in Australia in adopting policies on climate action and sustainability. A January 2020 ClimateWorks Australia local government report identified City of Moreland as one of 3 out of 57 municipal jurisdictions in Australia to have a &quot;fully aligned net zero by 2050 target that addresses both operational and community emissions.&quot;

City of Merri-bek is a member of ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy, the Cities Power Partnership, Climate Emergency Australia (CEA),
Climate Active, The Northern Alliance for Greenhouse Action (NAGA), and has declared pledges in the TAKE2 scheme with Sustainability Victoria.

Council declared a climate emergency on 12 September 2018.

===Council operational emissions reduction===
For operational emissions, Moreland Council was certified as a ‘carbon neutral’ council in 2012. This required purchase of carbon offset credits. Moreland was the second council in Victoria, and the third in Australia, to receive this certification. A target of 30% less emissions than 2011, with a stretch goal of 40% by 2020, was over-achieved with an emissions cut of 69% by 2020, which will reduce the carbon offsets required to be purchased.

Moreland City Council installed Victoria&#x27;s first EV fast charge station in 2013. This has now grown to a network of 16 public EV charging stations around the municipality which are powered by 100% zero emissions renewable energy from the Crowlands Wind Farm, near Ararat.

In 2014, City of Moreland joined with the City of Melbourne and several other institutions and established the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project (MREP). This project developed and funded the construction of a purpose-built 39 turbine, 80 MW Crowlands windfarm, which started supplying 100% renewables power to Council facilities and buildings in 2019.

===Net zero by 2040 community emissions target===
Moreland&#x27;s community wide municipal emissions in 2019 were 1,609,000 tonnes CO2e, composed of sectoral emissions of: Waste (3%), Transport (17%), Gas (21%), Electricity (59%).

The City of Merri-bek has set a community emissions reduction target of net zero emissions by 2040 and established the Moreland Zero Carbon 2040 Framework Strategy and the first 5-year action plan to achieve that target.

===Climate related policies and strategies===
Other key climate and sustainability policies and strategies driving climate action include: Climate Emergency Action Plan (2020 to 2025), Moreland Integrated Transport Strategy, Waste and Litter Strategy, Achieving zero Carbon in the Planning Scheme, Sustainable Buildings Policy, Urban Heat Island Effect Action Plan, Urban Forest Strategy, Watermap, Procurement policy, Cooling the Upfield Corridor Action Plan, Food Systems Strategy, Fossil Fuel Divestment Strategy, Moreland Nature Plan.

===Climate action endorsements===
During 2021 City of Moreland supported a climate disaster levy on coal exports, and endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, the first government jurisdiction in Australia to do so.

==Council==
===Current composition===

Councillors are elected from eleven single-member wards. The council&#x27;s most recent election took place in October 2024.

Since October 2024, Merri-bek has consisted of the following councillors:

<doc id="467254" wikidata="Q213642" url="?curid=467254" title="Rudolf Arnheim">
<text>Rudolf Arnheim (; July 15, 1904 – June 9, 2007) was a German-born writer, art and film theorist, and perceptual psychologist. He learned Gestalt psychology from studying under Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Köhler at the University of Berlin and applied it to art. 

His magnum opus was his book &quot;Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye&quot; (1954). Other major books by Arnheim have included &quot;Visual Thinking&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts&quot; (1982). &quot;Art and Visual Perception&quot; was revised, enlarged and published as a new version in 1974, and it has been translated into fourteen languages. He lived in Germany, Italy, England, and the U.S., where he taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard University, and the University of Michigan. 

In &quot;Art and Visual Perception&quot;, he tried to use science to better understand art. In his later book &quot;Visual Thinking&quot; (1969), Arnheim critiqued the assumption that language goes before perception. For Arnheim, the only access to reality we have is through our senses. Arnheim argued that perception is strongly identified with thinking, and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning. In &quot;The Power of the Center&quot;, Arnheim addressed the interaction of art and architecture on concentric and grid spatial patterns. He argued that form and content are indivisible, and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience.

==Early years==
Rudolf Arnheim was born into a Jewish family in 1904 on Alexanderplatz, in Berlin. Not long after he was born, his family moved to Kaiserdamm in Charlottenburg, where they stayed until the early 1930s. He was interested in art from a young age, as he began drawing as a child. His father, Georg Arnheim, owned a small piano factory, and Georg Arnheim&#x27;s plan for his son was for him to take over the factory. However, Rudolf wanted to continue his education, so his father agreed that he could spend half his week at the university and the other half at the factory. Rudolf ended up spending more time at the university, and when he was at the factory he was distracting the employees with his inquisitions about the mechanics of the piano, so his father agreed to let him focus entirely on his education. Rudolf was interested in psychology as long as he could remember, with his specific memory of buying some of the first editions of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s books when he was fifteen or sixteen. These fueled his interest in psychoanalysis.

== Career ==
Arnheim attended the University of Berlin, where he wished to focus his studies on psychology. At that time, psychology was a branch of philosophy, so Arnheim ended up majoring in experimental psychology and philosophy, and minoring in art history and music. There were many prominent faculty members at the university at this time, among them were Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler. Because Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Köhler were in the psychology department, most of the psychology concerned Gestalt psychology. The Psychological Institute of Berlin University was located on two floors of the Imperial Palace, so Arnheim worked in makeshift laboratories decorated with paintings of angels and other artwork. This institute was more of a workshop because everyone was doing experiments and using each other rather than sitting in lectures. For Arnheim&#x27;s dissertation, Max Wertheimer asked him to study human facial expressions and handwriting and how they corresponded. He looked at the extent to which people perceive an expression when they look at a face and what they perceive from a person&#x27;s handwriting, as well as how the two corresponded. This was the beginning of Arnheim&#x27;s study of expression, which he moved to looking at with visual arts. In 1928, he received his doctorate.

In the mid-1920s, Arnheim started to write film criticism for the &quot;Stachelschwein&quot;. Meanwhile, he sent his works to Siegfried Jacobsohn, the chief editor at &quot;Die Weltbühne&quot;, who accepted them. When Jacobsohn died in 1928, Ossietzky took over and then Arnheim worked on the cultural section until 1933. In the fall of 1932, Arnheim had an essay published in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;, about three months before the Nazis came to power. The essay was about the nature of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s moustaches and what the moustache did to the nose in terms of human character. Considering the timing of this essay, and the fact that in 1933 the sale of his book &quot;Film as Art&quot; was no longer permitted due to the Nazis, some of Arnheim&#x27;s friends advised him that he should leave the country and so, in August 1933, he moved to Rome. Arnheim lived and wrote about film and radio in Rome for the next six years. When World War II broke out, he moved to London, and he worked as a wartime translator for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He moved to the United States in 1940 and was shocked by all the lights of New York City. For him it was &quot;the end of exile&quot; since he had been used to living with constant black outs in London.

In 1943, he became a psychology professor at Sarah Lawrence College and a visiting lecturer at the New School for Social Research. Around this time he received two major awards. First, he received a Fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation. With this he worked at Columbia University with their Office of Radio Research to analyze soap-operas and how they affected American audiences. He also received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942 in order to study perception in art. He ideally wanted to write about applying Gestalt theory to visual arts, but felt he did not have enough research. He postponed the book in order to do more studies on space, expression, and movement. In 1951, Arnheim was awarded another Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship so that he could take a leave from teaching and he wrote &quot;Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye&quot;.

Arnheim was invited to join Harvard University as professor of the psychology of art in 1968, and he stayed there for six years. The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard was an important building to him, as it was the only building designed in America by Le Corbusier and it was based on the modular theory. He retired in 1974 to Ann Arbor, Michigan with his wife Mary. He became a visiting professor at the University of Michigan and taught there for ten years. Arnheim was a part of the American Society for Aesthetics and was their president for two terms, and was also the president for the Division on Psychology and the Arts of the American Psychological Association for three terms. In 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Ann Arbor in 2007.

== Works ==
Although &quot;Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye&quot; took fifteen months to complete, he felt that he essentially wrote it in one long sitting. Revised in 1974, it has been translated into fourteen languages, and is one of the most influential art books of the century. In &quot;Art and Visual Perception&quot;, he attempts to use science to better understand art, still keeping in mind the important aspects of personal bias, intuition, and expression. &quot;Visual Thinking&quot; (1969) challenges the differences between thinking versus perceiving and intellect versus intuition. In it Arnheim critiques the assumption that language goes before perception and that words are the stepping stones of thinking. Sensory knowledge allows for the possibility of language, since the only access to reality we have is through our senses. Visual perception is what allows us to have a true understanding of experience. Arnheim also argues that perception is strongly identified with thinking, and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning. In &quot;The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts&quot; (1982), Arnheim addresses the interaction of art and architecture on concentric and grid spatial patterns. He argues that form and content are indivisible, and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience.

== Theories ==
Arnheim believed that most people have their most productive ideas in their early twenties. They get hooked on an idea and spend the rest of their lives expanding on it. Arnheim&#x27;s productive or generative idea was that the meaning of life and the world could be perceived in the patterns, shapes, and colors of the world. Therefore, he believed that we have to study those patterns and discover what they mean. He believed that artwork is visual thinking and a means of expression, not just putting shapes and colors together that look appealing. Art is a way to help people understand the world, and a way to see how the world changes through your mind. Its function is to show the essence of something, like our existence. Overall, he wrote fifteen books about perceptual psychology and art, architecture, and film.

<text>The City of Whittlesea is a local government area located in the outer northern suburbs of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia. The city covers an area of , and in June 2023, it had an estimated population of 245,029 and is one of Victoria&#x27;s fastest growing Municipalities.

==History==
What became the City of Whittlesea had its origins in two separate roads districts (an early, single-purpose form of local government). The first, Whittlesea Roads District, was incorporated on 12 December 1862. On 1 January 1875 it was amalgamated with the Merriang riding of the Shire of Darebin to create the Shire of Whittlesea. The second, Epping Roads District, was incorporated on 21 July 1870. It was then enlarged on 11 January 1859 and then again on 25 July 1864 to cover the Northcote area. On 26 September 1870 it was merged with Merriang Roads District, Upper Plenty Roads District and Woodstock Roads District to form the Shire of Darebin. Part of the Shire of Darebin was then excised to create the Shire of Jika in 1872, and, as stated above, Merriang riding was merged with the Whittlesea Roads District to form the Shire of Whittlesea in 1875. The Shire of Darebin was renamed the Shire of Epping on 22 March 1894. On 1 October 1915, the Shire of Epping was absorbed by the Shire of Whittlesea as part of a restructuring of local government outside the Melbourne metropolitan area in Victoria.

On 31 May 1955, parts of the City of Broadmeadows were annexed to Shire of Whittlesea and the neighbouring Shire of Bulla. The population grew rapidly as urbanisation reached the southern edge of the shire. In 1979 an internal redistribution took place creating the four ridings based on population and on 30 March 1988 it was proclaimed by the Governor of Victoria as a City, effective from 15 April of that year. Until the amalgamations of the mid-1990s, the City was in size.

On 15 December 1994, massive local government reform once again affected Whittlesea&#x27;s boundaries, although unlike most, the City survived largely intact. 18% of its land area was ceded to entities created in 1994 – the Doreen and Arthurs Creek districts were lost to the new Shire of Nillumbik, while Kinglake West went to Shire of Murrindindi and Somerton to the City of Hume.

Until April 1993, the council met at the Shire Office at High Street and Houston Street, Epping, next to the primary school. In that month, it moved to its present headquarters in Ferres Boulevard, South Morang. The original premises in Epping is now a council depot.

The City of Whittlesea is a culturally diverse community with the 2021 Census recording that 41.9% of residents were born overseas.

Whittlesea 2040 is a long term vision for the City and guides the Council&#x27;s work and future partnerships with the community and others.

==Council==
After a three-month investigation into administrative and governing issues, on 20 March 2020 the Victorian state government dismissed Whittlesea council and replaced them with three administrators who governed for four years.

===Current composition===

The current council, elected in 2024, is:
===Wards===
Historically, Shire of Whittlesea was divided into four ridings, each electing three Councillors. When it became a City in 1988, these were converted into wards:

* Centre Ward (formerly Yan Yean Riding, then Central Riding)
* East Ward (formerly Morang Riding, then South East Riding)
* West Ward (formerly Thomastown Riding, then South West Riding)
* North Ward (formerly Whittlesea Riding, then North Riding)

Over a number of elections there have been changes to the number of wards and Councillors. In 1994 Whittlesea was re-subdivided into nine wards, each with one Councillor. At the 2005 election the Victorian Electoral Commission reviewed the ward boundaries and composition. This resulted in three wards, each electing three Councillors.

At the 2012 General Election the three wards were retained, however changes were made to ward boundaries to reflect the municipality&#x27;s growing population. In total eleven Councillors were elected:
* North Ward (3 Councillors)
* South-East Ward (4 Councillors)
* South-West Ward (4 Councillors)

Ahead of the October 2024 local government elections, the City of Whittlesea changed to an 11 single-Councillor ward structure, comprising 11 electoral wards with one Councillor per ward:

* Bundoora Ward
* Epping Ward
* Ganbu Gulinj Ward
* Kirrip Ward
* Lalor Ward
* Mernda Ward
* Mill Park Ward
* North Ward
* Painted Hills Ward
* South Morang Ward
* Thomastown Ward.

==Main suburbs==
===Bundoora===

The traditional owners of the land now known as Bundoora were probably the Wurundjeri-willam clan. Bundoora was named after Keelbundoora, which was the name of the parish (land) where Bundoora exists today. Keelbundoora was also the name of the young boy present at the signing of the Batman treaty, a historic land agreement made by European settler, John Batman with the Aboriginal people of Melbourne in 1835. The treaty was later ruled invalid by the government of the day. Only a small part of Bundoora is within the City of Whittlesea boundary, the rest of the suburb is served by Darebin City Council and Banyule City Council.

===Lalor===

Lalor was established in 1947. Lalor was originally the home of a low-cost housing project that provided houses for ex-servicemen returning from World War II. The first primary school opened in 1954.

===Thomastown===

Legend has it that Thomastown was named after a local settler called Thomas who started a popular market garden in 1848. It was more than likely named after Thomastown in Ireland, a parish and market town in the County of Kilkenny, or a station on the Waterford to Kilkenny Junction railway. Thomastown East Primary school was opened in 1961.

===Epping===

Epping was named after the Epping Forest in Essex, England in 1853. The first hotel opened the same year. The first Catholic school was opened in 1844.

===South Morang===

South Morang is named after the Parish (or area) of Morang where the suburb exists today. The first primary school in South Morang was built in 1877 and the suburb has two major parks, Hawkstowe and Plenty Gorge Parklands. The Mernda railway line runs through the suburb, as in many other suburbs in the municipality.

===Whittlesea===

Whittlesea, as the township came to be called, was named after Whittlesey in England. Close to 1889 a railway from Whittlesea to Melbourne was established to transport goods produced in the region to Melbourne. Whittlesea station closed in 1959, with services ending at Lalor. The line has been progressively rebuilt and now ends at Mernda, opened in 2018.

===Mill Park===

Mill Park was named after Henry &quot;Money&quot; Miller who bred racehorses and conducted a range of dairy and grazing activities at his property named The Findon Hounds and the Findon Harriers Hunt Club until 1930. Residential development began in Mill Park in the 1970s.

===Mernda===

This area has grown from a population of 1316 in 2001 to 23,369 in 2021, and is anticipated to grow to around 40,000 people at full development. The name Mernda means &quot;young girl&quot; in the local Wurundjeri Aboriginal language. When Mernda was named in 1913 the township consisted of a school, a Methodist church, a store and a railway station. In the early 1900s there were many dairy farms in Mernda that supplied milk to Melbourne.

==Townships and localities==
The 2021 census, the city had a population of 229,396 up from 197,491 in the 2016 census

^ - &quot;Territory divided with another LGA&quot;

==Population==
==Previous mayors==

There have been 23 mayors of Whittlesea since 1997. The mayor is elected yearly from amongst the elected Councillors to serve as leader of the council.

<text>Frederick Morgan Taylor (April 17, 1903 – February 16, 1975) was an American hurdler and the first athlete to win three Olympic medals in the 400 m hurdles. He was the flag bearer for the United States at his last Olympics in 1932.

In 1924, Taylor won the 400 m Olympic trials with a world best time of 52.6 s, which was accepted as a national record, but not as a world record. While winning the gold medal at the 1924 Olympics he clocked the same time, but knocked one hurdle, and the record was again not ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). In 1925, he won his second AAU title in the 440 yd hurdles in a world best time of 53.8 s, but this record was discounted too. Finally the IAAF accepted his 400 m record of 52.0 s set at the 1928 Olympic trials.

While studying at Grinnell College, Taylor competed in both track and field and football. He won the NCAA 220 yd hurdle title in 1927 and finished second in the long jump in 1925. After graduating he worked as a salesman for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and then as a teacher and athletics coach. His son F. Morgan Taylor Jr. also competed in track and field as a long jumper.

<doc id="467261" wikidata="Q7874513" url="?curid=467261" title="USS Suwanee (1864)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Suwanee&quot; was a 3rd-rate gunboat commissioned by the Union Navy in its struggle against the Confederate States of America in the American Civil War.

Commissioned late in the war, &quot;Suwanee&quot; spent several weeks searching for the Confederate raider CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; without success. &quot;Suwanee&quot; was eventually wrecked off British Columbia in 1868.

==Construction and design==

&quot;Suwanee&quot;—a double-ended, iron-hulled, sidewheel-propelled gunboat—was built for the U.S. Navy by Reaney, Son &amp; Archbold of Chester, Pennsylvania. She was 255 feet in length, with a beam of 35 feet, draft of 9 feet, hold depth of 12 feet and displacement of 1,030 tons.

&quot;Suwanee&quot; was powered by a 58-inch bore, 8-foot 9-inch stroke, inclined, direct-acting steam engine, fitted with a surface condenser. Steam was supplied by four boilers: two main boilers of the horizontal, tubular type, and two superheated. The ship was also rigged as a two-masted schooner for auxiliary sail power. Total cost of the vessel was $171,000.

&quot;Suwanee&quot; was launched on 13 March 1864, delivered to the Navy at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 14 December, and commissioned on 23 January 1865, Comdr. Paul Shirley in command.

==Service history== 
Ordered to the Pacific Ocean, the new double-ender departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at dawn on 17 February 1865 and proceeded via New York City down the Atlantic coast of the Americas looking for Confederate commerce raiders, especially for CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, which had been plaguing Northern shipping.

She then steamed up the Pacific coast and arrived at Acapulco, Mexico, where she joined the Pacific Squadron on 30 July. The side-wheeler was promptly ordered to sea in quest of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. 
After the Southern cruiser &quot;Shenandoah&quot; surrendered at Liverpool, England, late in the year, &quot;Suwanee&quot; cruised along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Canada.

On 9 July 1868, &quot;Suwanee&quot; was wrecked in Shadwell Passage, Queen Charlotte Sound, British Columbia.

<text>The City of Stonnington is a local government area located within the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia. It comprises the inner south-eastern suburbs, between , from the Melbourne CBD. The city covers an area of .

Within twenty years of the settlement of Melbourne in 1835, the Prahran Municipality (later City of Prahran) was formed in 1855, followed by the Gardiner Road Board (later City of Malvern) in 1856.

The late 19th century saw substantial residential and commercial development such that by 1891 Prahran had a population of almost 40,000 and Malvern 11,000. Following the election of the Kennett government in the Spring of 1992, as part of a comprehensive reorganisation of local government in Victoria, the Cities of Malvern and Prahran were amalgamated to form the City of Stonnington.

The logo of the City of Stonnington features two interlocking celebratory ribbons representing the coming together of the two former cities of Malvern and Prahran.

Following the amalgamation of the cities the Malvern Town Hall was renamed the Stonnington City Centre and it became the corporate headquarters of the new Stonnington City Council. In 2015, the new Stonnington City Centre, opposite at 311 Glenferrie Road, was opened and the Malvern Town Hall reverted to its original name.

The name Stonnington comes from Stonington mansion, the Charles D&#x27;Ebro-designed mansion built in 1890 for a founding partner of Cobb &amp; Co, John Wagner, who named the house after his wife&#x27;s birthplace in Stonington, Connecticut, USA. The house is located in Glenferrie Road, Malvern.

The City of Stonnington had a population of 116,207 in June 2018.

The City of Stonnington is the richest local government area in Victoria.

==History==


Prior to European settlement, the land of the City of Stonnington was occupied by the Wurundjeri, an Indigenous Australian Woiwurrung speaking people of the Kulin nation.

The establishment of European settlers in what was then the Port Phillip District of New South Wales in 1835, was soon followed by pastoralist John Gardiner, together with Joseph Hawdon and John Hepburn, driving cattle south from Yass to Kooyong Koot (later named Gardiner&#x27;s) Creek, in the area now known as Malvern and establishing a homestead and grazing property.

The first sale of land by the Crown in the area took place on 10 June 1840 when land bounded by Kooyong Road, Gardiners Creek (Yarra River). Gardiners Creek Road (now Toorak Road) and Glenferrie Road was sold. The purchasers included Jane Hill (the widow of pastoralist David Hill), the Langhorne Bros. (the nephews of Captain William Lonsdale), Capt. John Browne and James Jackson.

The high ground between Gardiner&#x27;s Creek Road (now Toorak Road) and the river returned the best prices and it was here that most of the grand mansions of the period were built. Much of the land south of Toorak Road was swampy. This area was subdivided into much smaller blocks, for workman&#x27;s cottages and later to house gold-rush immigrants. The distinction between the two areas remains today in the suburbs of Toorak and South Yarra. Further auctions of land in the Prahran area took place in 1849 and 1850.

The early 1850s saw the return of many miners from the gold diggings to Prahran, resulting in increased development and the gazetting as a municipality in 1855. The population of Prahran at the time of the first council elections was about 8,000. Meanwhile, Government land sales within the area bounded by Kooyong Road, Gardiners Creek and Wattletree Road were held in 1854 and a small settlement grew around Malvern and Glenferrie Roads. The area known as Gardiner (later Malvern) was proclaimed a Roads Board District in 1856 and became a municipality in 1871, taking the name Malvern in 1878.

The 1880s and 1890s saw substantial residential and commercial development in the City of Prahran, such that by 1891 Prahran had a population of almost 40,000. The development of Malvern followed from 1900 onwards and by 1921 Malvern&#x27;s population was almost 33,000.

==Geography==

The western part of the city, around South Yarra, Prahran and Windsor, were originally part of the Yarra River flood plain and much of the area was covered by swamps, bogs, and creeks, formed from the run-off from the Malvern Hills to the east. The Albert Park Lake to the west is a remnant of the original flood plain.

The City of Stonnington is bounded by the Yarra River and Gardiners Creek to the north, Warrigal Road to the east, Dandenong Road and Queens Way to the south and Punt Road to the west. Stonnington has numerous tree-lined streets and 126 parks and gardens as well as 27 off-leash parks . Many public reserves occur along the Gardiners Creek valley. The city has some of Melbourne&#x27;s major shopping precincts in Chapel Street, Glenferrie Road, High Street, Malvern Road and Toorak Road, as well as the Chadstone Shopping Centre. Local sporting venues include Malvern Valley Golf Club, Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club and Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre.

<doc id="467264" wikidata="Q8021646" url="?curid=467264" title="Willie McRae">
<text>Willie McRae (18 May 1923 – 7 April 1985) was a Scottish lawyer, orator, naval officer, politician and anti-nuclear campaigner. In the Second World War he served in the British Army and then the Royal Indian Navy. He supported the Indian independence movement and for much of his life was active in the Scottish National Party (SNP).

McRae, who struggled with alcoholism and depression, died by suicide in 1985 after crashing his car in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands, shooting himself in the head with a revolver. Over the next thirty years, McRae&#x27;s death became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; among Scottish Nationalists, with many expressing the belief that he had been killed by the British security services. Two plays related to McRae&#x27;s life were staged in 2014, which prompted renewed interest in his death and the establishment of a privately-funded &quot;Justice For Willie&quot; campaign. The campaign reported in 2016 that it had been unable to find any evidence to undermine the official suicide verdict.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
McRae was born in Carron, Falkirk, where his father was an electrician. McRae edited a local newspaper in Grangemouth at the same time as reading history at the University of Glasgow, from which he gained a first-class degree. After the war McRae returned to the University of Glasgow and graduated again, this time in law. He authored the maritime law of Israel and was an emeritus professor of the University of Haifa. After his death a forest of 3,000 trees was planted in Israel in his memory.

=== War service ===
In the Second World War he was commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders but transferred to the Royal Indian Navy, in which he became a lieutenant commander and aide-de-camp to Admiral Lord Mountbatten. He supported the Indian independence movement.

=== Political activities ===
McRae became a solicitor and an SNP activist. In both of the 1974 General Elections and in the 1979 General Election he stood for Parliament as the SNP candidate for Ross and Cromarty. In October 1974 he only lost to the Conservative Hamish Gray by 633 votes, but in 1979 Gray&#x27;s majority increased to 4,735. In the latter year he also contested the SNP leadership, coming third in a three-way contest with 52 votes to Stephen Maxwell&#x27;s 117 votes and winner Gordon Wilson&#x27;s 530 votes.

McRae was a vocal critic of the British nuclear lobby. Early in the 1980s he was a key figure in a campaign against the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority plans to dispose of nuclear waste in the Mullwharchar area of the Galloway Hills. Representing the SNP in a public inquiry, McRae asked difficult questions of the UKAEA and famously declared at one meeting that &quot;nuclear waste should be stored where Guy Fawkes put his gunpowder.&quot; The authority&#x27;s plans were rejected, and McRae was credited with &quot;single-handedly&quot; preventing the area from becoming a nuclear waste dump.

==Death==

McRae struggled with both depression and alcoholism: following his death, McRae&#x27;s brother Fergus related to the police that he had &quot;not been himself&quot; and had been drinking heavily.

On 5 April 1985 McRae left his Glasgow flat at 18:30 to spend the weekend at his cottage at Ardelve near Dornie, Ross-shire. He was not seen again until the next morning around 10:00, when two Australian tourists, Alan Crowe, an Australian airline pilot, and his wife Barbara, saw his maroon Volvo saloon car on a moor a short distance from the junction of the A887 and A87 roads Bun Loyne, Glenmoriston, Inverness-shire. The car was straddling a burn about from the road. The tourists flagged down the next car to pass, whose driver turned out to be a doctor, Dorothy Messer, accompanied by her fiancé as well as David Coutts, an SNP Dundee councillor who knew McRae.

It was discovered that McRae was in the car. Dr Messer recalled that McRae still had his seatbelt on and that the car&#x27;s door was wedged against the uneven ground. McRae was unresponsive with a wound to his temple, with blood clotted in his hair. Messer recalled &quot;a strong smell of stale alcohol from him.&quot;

Another car was sent to call the emergency services. Dr Messer examined McRae and found that he was still alive and breathing. She noted that one of his pupils was dilated, indicating the possibility of brain damage, and estimated that he had been in that state for 10 hours.

McRae was removed by ambulance to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, accompanied by Dr Messer. After admission it was decided to transfer him to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. At Aberdeen it was realised that the incident was more than a road accident; six hours after he had been found, a nurse washing his head discovered what appeared to be the entry wound of a gunshot. An X-ray confirmed that McRae had been shot above his right ear and a bullet was detected in his head. His brain was severely damaged and his vital functions very weak. The next day, Sunday 7 April, after consultation with his next of kin, McRae&#x27;s life-support machine was switched off.

===Investigation===
The investigation was headed by Chief Superintendent Andrew Lister of Northern Constabulary CID. Despite no weapon having yet been found, McRae&#x27;s car was moved at 12:00 on 7 April. It later transpired that the police had kept no record of the precise location where the car had been found, and the position stated by them was later found to be in error, and was corrected by a witness who had been present at the scene.

A weapon was found on Sunday 7 April, in a pool of water directly beneath where the car had been discovered. It was a Smith &amp; Wesson .22 calibre revolver containing two spent cartridges and five remaining rounds.

McRae&#x27;s personal effects, comprising a bottle of whisky and a briefcase containing papers, were returned to his brother Fergus, who recalled that there was &quot;nothing untoward or sinister in the paperwork, it was nothing that seemed unusual or special.&quot;

==Controversy==
Although it was ruled at the time by authorities that McRae&#x27;s death was undetermined, aspects of the investigation remain disputed. Neither McRae&#x27;s medical reports nor the post-mortem data have been released to the public. There was no fatal accident inquiry. This and inconsistencies in police statements led to a conspiracy theory developing in Scottish Nationalist circles that McRae had been murdered by the British security services. A mythology developed around McRae&#x27;s death, including allegations that the distance from McRae&#x27;s car at which the gun was found and the lack of fingerprints on it rendered a suicide not credible; that McRae was shot twice and in the back of the neck rather than once in the temple; and that McRae was carrying incriminating papers that were not found with his body following his death. These papers supposedly related to the dumping of nuclear waste from the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment, or an alleged paedophile ring in Westminster.

McRae&#x27;s family never accepted the conspiracy theories that he had been murdered. McRae&#x27;s younger brother Fergus said in 2015; &quot;There is no question in my mind of what happened. There was no murder or anything like that. I am absolutely positive about that. He did not discover anything that would have put his life at risk. There is no reason not to accept the official turn of events.&quot;

Winnie Ewing – then President of the SNP and herself an accomplished lawyer – was directed by the SNP&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) to conduct an internal investigation for the party to come to a conclusion as to whether Ewing &quot;was satisfied or dissatisfied with the official version that he committed suicide&quot;. Having been refused access to police records of the investigation and rebuffed by both the Lord Advocate and the Procurator Fiscal in her attempts to conduct private, confidential meetings with them, Ewing, as she later wrote, came &quot;up against a brick wall&quot;. Ewing reported to the SNP NEC that she was not satisfied with the official account of suicide: &quot;I do not know what happened, but I think it is important that the truth emerges, despite the time that has passed. Why the State refuses to let the truth be known is a pertinent question.&quot;

In 1991, Channel 4 broadcast a &quot;Scottish Eye&quot; documentary investigating the mysterious circumstances of McRae&#x27;s death. It found evidence to suggest that McRae had been under surveillance by UK intelligence services and that his death had likely involved foul play.

In 2005, Winnie Ewing&#x27;s son Fergus, by then an MSP, requested a meeting with Elish Angiolini, Solicitor General for Scotland, to discuss allegations that have persisted that McRae was under surveillance at the time of his death. The request was rebuffed, with Angiolini claiming that he had not been under surveillance and that she was satisfied that a thorough investigation into the case had been carried out.

In July 2006, a retired police officer, Iain Fraser, who was working as a private investigator at the time of McRae&#x27;s death, claimed that he had been anonymously employed to keep McRae under surveillance only weeks before he died. In November 2006 an episode of the Scottish Television show &quot;Unsolved&quot; examined the circumstances of McRae&#x27;s death.

In November 2010, John Finnie, then SNP group leader on Highland Council and a former police officer, wrote to the Lord Advocate urging her to reinvestigate McRae&#x27;s death and release any details so far withheld. Finnie&#x27;s request was prompted by the release the previous month of further details concerning the death of David Kelly. In January 2011 the Crown Office requested the files on the case from Northern Constabulary.

Also in November 2010, Donald Morrison, a former Strathclyde Police officer, alleged that McRae had been &quot;under surveillance&quot; by both Special Branch and MI5. Morrison had collaborated with former colleague Iain Fraser to discover more about McRae&#x27;s death. Morrison called for an enquiry into McRae&#x27;s death and promised that he would give it a sworn affidavit that MI5 was involved.

In July 2014, two unconnected plays by George Gunn and Andy Paterson about McRae&#x27;s life and death, both coincidentally titled &quot;3,000 Trees&quot;, were staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. One of the plays explored his anti-nuclear campaigning, links with nationalist radicals and allegations that Special Branch and MI5 were surveilling him.

In April 2015, there was a campaign to have a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) on McRae&#x27;s death. It attracted 6,500 signatures in 5 days.

The petition eventually collected over 13,000 signatures and was handed in, in June 2015. The Crown Office rejected the proposal to hold a Fatal Accident Inquiry.

On the Easter weekend of April 2015, the 30th anniversary of McRae&#x27;s death, &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; ran a story claiming that McRae&#x27;s Volvo was moved back to the crash site by Northern Constabulary in an attempt to hide that the car had been moved before the bullet had been found – accounting for the discrepancies relating to the gun&#x27;s distance from the car.

On the same day, one of the journalists involved started crowdfunding for a book on the case titled &#x27;30 Years of Silence&#x27;.

Following the rejection of the petition for a Fatal Accident Inquiry by the Crown Office, a &quot;Justice For Willie&quot; Campaign group was set up by Mark MacNicol. The campaign decided to launch their own investigation since no official inquiry was forthcoming. They hired two private investigators to re-interview original witnesses from the time of Willie McRae&#x27;s death. The results were published in November 2016, and the campaign were unable to find any new evidence to undermine the official suicide verdict.

==Controversies==
===Australia Day===
In August 2017 the City of Darebin followed the City of Yarra Council in deciding not to celebrate Australia Day events. This was criticised by conservative commentators, with the Federal government subsequently removing the council&#x27;s powers to hold citizenship ceremonies.

===Same-sex marriage===
In the lead-up to the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey the council announced it will allow pro same-sex marriage campaigners to use its facilities and services (for free) and deny this access to those of an alternate view. This was criticised by conservative commentators but welcomed by community members.

The council subsequently reversed its plans to oppose those campaigning for the &#x27;no&#x27; vote.

===Men banned from applying for a council position===
In September 2021, it was widely reported in the Australian media that the Darebin City Council had banned men from applying for a new position despite being an &quot;equal opportunity employer&quot;.
===2022 state election===
During the 2022 Victorian state election Labor took what they described as a &#x27;Greens-dominated&#x27; Darebin council to court for removing Labor&#x27;s billboards in the state seat of Northcote. Labor was able to obtain a court order that the council not interfere with Labor&#x27;s campaign material.

<doc id="467269" wikidata="Q234472" url="?curid=467269" title="Estella Warren">
<text>Estella Dawn Warren (born December 23, 1978) is a Canadian actress, fashion model and former synchronized swimmer. During her swimming career she was a member of the Canada national team and won three national titles. Since 1994, she has been modelling through publications such as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as well as working for campaigns for such brands as Perry Ellis and Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

Warren later began a career as an actress, starring in such films as Tim Burton&#x27;s 2001 re-adapted film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; as well as television roles in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. After she moved back to Toronto, Warren was represented by M Models and Talent Management.

==Early life==
Estella Warren was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, to Esther, an elementary school headmistress, and Don Warren, a used-car dealer. She is the youngest of three daughters.

==Career==
===Synchronized swimming===
In 1990, Warren moved to Toronto to train with the national synchronized swimming team. In 1995, after becoming the senior national champion, Warren had the chance to move on to the 1996 Summer Olympics. She is a three-time Canada national team champion and the solo bronze medallist at the 1995 Junior World Championships.

===Fashion modeling===
Estella Warren was discovered by Rhonda Broadbelt Fonte, the owner of Broadbelt &amp; Fonte Models, in 1994 when she was a synchronized swimmer living in Ontario. Broadbelt Fonte then introduced Warren to George Gallier, the owner of American Models. She then went to New York City to shoot some photo tests. During that time, Gallier introduced her to fashion photographer Ellen Von Unwerth, who booked her for a photo shoot for &quot;Italian&quot; &quot;Vogue&quot;.

She began her international modelling career with the Cacharel fragrance campaign &quot;Eau d&#x27;Eden&quot; in 1996, with French photographer director Jean-Paul Goude. The &quot;Chanel No. 5&quot; campaign with director Luc Besson followed in 1998; both campaigns happened while she was managed by George Gallier.

Warren has appeared on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and in two television commercials for &quot;Chanel No. 5&quot; perfume. Warren was ranked Number 1 on &quot;Maxim&#x27;s Hot 100 List&quot; in 2000 when she was 21. She was ranked Number 52 in &quot;FHM&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World 2006&quot; special supplement and was the November 2007 entry in &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine&#x27;s pinup calendar.

Warren also has appeared in campaigns for &quot;UGG Australia, Andrew Marc, Perry Ellis, Nine West, Cartier, Volvo, De Beers&quot; and &quot;Cacharel&quot;, as well as in television advertisements for &quot;Samsung&quot;. Additionally, she has modelled for Victoria&#x27;s Secret and hosted the television special for the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue.

She posed nude for the cover of the third issue of the 3D magazine &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful&quot;, which came out in June 2013.

===Acting===

Warren&#x27;s films include &quot;Driven&quot; (2001), &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001), &quot;Kangaroo Jack&quot; (2003), &quot;The Cooler&quot; (2003), &quot;Stranger Within&quot; (2013) and &quot;Just Within Reach&quot; (2017).

Warren appeared in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in 2003, as well as a two-part crossover role in &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in September 2005. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; in 2005.

Warren has appeared in music videos for INXS&#x27;s &quot;Afterglow&quot;, Blank &amp; Jones&#x27; &quot;Beyond Time&quot; and Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;I Need a Doctor&quot;. She also appeared in the film &quot;Just Within Reach&quot; with Lenny Von Dohlen, Alex Cubis, Tami Romen and Thomas Duffy.

==Personal life==
===Legal issues===
On May 24, 2011, Warren was arrested in Los Angeles after she allegedly hit three parked cars with her Toyota Prius and then fled the scene. Police eventually found her and arrested her for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). During her arrest she allegedly kicked an officer and resisted being handcuffed. Later, at the police station where her arrest was being booked, she managed to slip her cuffs and run, but was quickly recaptured. Ultimately she was charged with DUI, hit-and-run, battery on a police officer and resisting a police officer. Her bail was set at $100,000. On August 19, 2011, Warren entered a no-contest plea to the drunken driving charge and the other charges were dropped; she was ordered to a residential rehab facility for four months.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department recorded Warren&#x27;s date of birth as December 23, 1970. Although Warren&#x27;s 1978 birth year is well established, some news sources then reported that she was born in 1970 or cited her age as if she were born that year.

In 2017, Warren was arrested for domestic violence after allegedly throwing cleaning fluid at her boyfriend.

Dirt tracks wound through the swamps and sandy heaths of the district. They were constantly damaged by farmers&#x27; cart wheels, creating dangerous holes and making access difficult.

In 1853 the Victorian Parliament passed an Act to give authority to locally elected people to extract rates from residents in order to finance road construction. Residents lobbied for a roads district to be proclaimed to ensure that roads were maintained and passable. Caulfield&#x27;s organised communal existence began as a District Roads Board in 1857 and the first Caulfield Roads Board was elected in November 1857. It had control over the roads in an area bounded by Warrigal Road, Hotham Street, Dandenong Road, North Road and Brighton Road. The proclamation of the Caulfield Roads Board tied the name &#x27;Caulfield&#x27; to a specific area.

Moorabbin became a Roads Board in 1862. The board&#x27;s boundaries extended from the outskirts of Brighton and south-east along both sides of the Nepean Road as far as Mordialloc Creek, taking in the coastal areas now known as Hampton, Sandringham, Beaumaris and Mentone.

Caulfield became a Shire in 1871 and a City in 1913; Moorabbin became a Shire in 1874 and a City in 1934.

The first railway link to the area was at Caulfield and Carnegie railway stations, which opened in 1879, to be followed in 1881 by Glen Huntly and Ormond railway stations.

For the first 25 years of Caulfield&#x27;s municipal life, board/shire members met in &quot;Mood Kee&quot;, the house of Cr Harold Pennington. He was paid 10 pounds a year to cover the cost of candles, fuel and the room. The annual general meeting was held in a tent in the backyard. The Caulfield Town Hall (now the Glen Eira Town Hall) was built in 1885. The building was modified several times to meet the growing demands of the municipality, as was Moorabbin Town Hall.

Moorabbin, part of the earliest development of Melbourne, began as an outpost of &quot;Dendy&#x27;s Brighton&quot; and took shape as a market garden area along what was Arthur&#x27;s Seat Road, now the Nepean Highway. For more than a century, the sandy soil of Moorabbin provided metropolitan Melbourne with much of its fruit and vegetables.

After World War II, Moorabbin became one of the first &#x27;boom suburbs&#x27;. By the 1950s, along with the Sydney suburb of Bankstown, it became the fastest growing municipality in Australia.

Road conditions were just one of the major challenges to face the elected bodies in a developing area. As the farms and market gardens gave way to housing and the district&#x27;s population grew, street lighting (originally gas), drainage, sewerage, rubbish collection, tips and other services were provided.

Today, the City of Glen Eira is an established area. Glen Eira City Council is responsible for maintaining an ageing infrastructure and strives to update with works on roads, drains and footpaths.

Public health issues have always been a key part of Council&#x27;s activities. A clean water supply and sanitary removal of sewage was critical last century because of outbreaks of disease, such as typhoid, diphtheria and scarlet fever. These functions have now been taken by Melbourne Water.

Council has for a long time had a role in controlling the impact of animals on health and well-being. Late last century, Caulfield Council was paying a reward for the heads of rats. Dog registration was instituted in 1865.

Social caring and support roles have continued to grow, from maternal and child health centres – the first opened around 1924 – to providing work for the unemployed during the Depression, digging trenches in Caulfield Park during World War II, setting up welfare funds and operating Meals on Wheels from 1957.

Immunisation services have been provided since the last century. Council libraries began in the district with the Bentleigh Library in July 1961; the Caulfield service followed in 1963.

Providing public open spaces has also been a long tradition. Paddy&#x27;s Swamp (now Caulfield Park) was set aside as a reserve in the 1880s. Many other sites once used as tips were turned into parks and gardens. Some parks were provided partly to cater for the large crowds at municipal band performances. As involvement in sport developed, so did the reserves&#x27; facilities.

===Names===

Caulfield

The origin of the name of Caulfield is uncertain, however the name seemed to be linked with Baron Caulfeild of Ireland, perhaps through John Caulfield, a pioneer of the colony.

The name &#x27;Caulfield&#x27; was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse. It was not in general use for the whole area until the proclamation of the Caulfield Road District in 1857.

Moorabbin

The name &quot;Moorabbin&quot; is derived from an Aboriginal word which principally means &#x27;a resting place&#x27;. The proper name is probably &#x27;moorooboon&#x27;, a term used by the tribal group of the area, the Bunurong. The first European settlers may have found &#x27;moorooboon&#x27; difficult to pronounce and accordingly corrupted the word for ease of use. The name Moorabbin applied from the earliest days of the Port Phillip settlement and remains today.

Glen Huntly

Glen Huntly is named after a ship, the &quot;Glen Huntly&quot;, that arrived in Port Phillip in 1840, after setting off from Greenock, Scotland. She was carrying 190 new immigrants, skilled manual labourers who were heading for the new colony settled in Melbourne. Fever, most likely typhoid, struck the ship mid journey and only 50 people survived to reach Port Phillip Bay. The &quot;Glen Huntly&quot; was forced to land at Little Red Bluff (now Point Ormond) and Victoria&#x27;s first quarantine station was formed to deal with the crisis. Supplies and provisions were brought down what is now Glen Huntly Road and the small town was formed.

Until recently Glen Huntly was spelt &#x27;Glenhuntly&#x27;. The Council voted to change the spelling of the name of the suburb and of the road that bears the name to bring it to the historical spelling. However, the vote did not affect the spelling of the train station which continues to be spelt &#x27;Glenhuntly&#x27;. The section of the Glen Huntly Road/Glenhuntly Road which comes within the boundaries of the City of Port Phillip continued for a time to be spelt &#x27;Glenhuntly Road&#x27;, but has now been changed to bring it into line with the rest of the road.

Bentleigh

One of Moorabbin&#x27;s early identities was Thomas Bent, who was simultaneously a Councillor on both Moorabbin and Brighton Councils for more than 40 years, as well becoming a State Member of Parliament and Premier. The suburb of Bentleigh is named after him.

Carnegie

Carnegie was originally called Rosstown, after William Murray Ross, a developer. The name was changed to Carnegie in 1909 in an unsuccessful attempt to secure funds for a library from the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The original name lives on in the name of the local hotel, and Rosstown Road. Leila Road is named after Mr Ross&#x27;s wife, and Grange Road is named after Ross&#x27; estate, &quot;The Grange&quot;, which has since been subdivided and is now suburban housing estates. Carnegie Primary School (No. 2897) was established in 1888 as Rosstown State School. The Carnegie theatre was, in the 1930s, a popular cinema, but has since been converted into offices.

===Train network===

Caulfield railway station originally opened on 7 May 1879.

Glen Huntly railway station opened on 19 December 1881 as Glen Huntly Road. It was later renamed to Glen Huntly in 1882 before being renamed Glenhuntly in 1937 and then back to Glen Huntly in 2023.

Ormond railway station opened on 19 December 1881 as North Road. It was later renamed to [Ormond in 1897.

Carnegie railway station opened on 14 May 1879 as Rosstown. It was later renamed to Carnegie in 1909.

===Monash University, Caulfield Campus===
Monash University, Caulfield campus was founded as the Caulfield Technical School in 1922. A Junior Technical High School was added in the 1950s, with the Technical School becoming a Senior Technical High School. They separated in 1958 with the junior school absorbed by other technical schools in the area and the senior school became Caulfield Technical College. In the 1970s it became the Caulfield Institute of Technology. In 1982 the Caulfield Institute of Technology amalgamated with the State College of Victoria at Frankston to form the Chisholm Institute of Technology. This Institution merged with Monash University in 1990 and became Monash University, Caulfield campus. 

===Merger===

In 1994 the local government structure was radically altered. The City of Glen Eira was formed from the City of Caulfield and the northern part of the City of Moorabbin. In March 1997 Glen Eira&#x27;s first Council was elected by residents and ratepayers.

===Sacking of Council - 2004===

In September 2004, the then Minister for Local Government, Candy Broad, was asked to appoint an inspector by the Glen Eira City Council to investigate and report on matters arising out of an internal audit of councillors&#x27; expenses. In July 2005, the Inspector of Municipal Administration, Merv Whelan, forwarded a report to the Minister. The key findings portrayed a complete breakdown of communication and behavioural standards within the elected council, although Whelan found the council was well-managed and in a sound financial position because of its CEO and administration. A report in &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper alleged that several councillors had used their phone entitlements for non-council purposes.

On 11 August 2005, the then Minister sacked the council, and appointed John Lester, the former Chief Commissioner of Darebin City Council and former chair of the Victorian Grants Commission, as Administrator. An election for a new council was held on 26 November 2005 with redrawn ward boundaries. Only one councillor from the previous council, Margaret Esakoff, was re-elected. Three other sacked councillors (Noel Erlich, Veronika Martens and Bob Bury) did run again but failed to get elected into council.

===Carbon neutral===
Controversially, in 2009 the City of Glen Eira was one of the few regions in the Melbourne metropolitan area to make the decision not to become carbon neutral, despite most LGA&#x27;s in Melbourne converting to a cleaner energy contract.

In 2020, Glen passed a motion to declare a climate emergency, and committed to net zero Council carbon emissions by 2025.

==Council==
Glen Eira City Council is the third tier of government and deals with services such as waste collection, building permits and approvals, roads, drainage, health services, food safety, parks and gardens, library services, pets, street parking permits and the collection of rates and charges. The Council meets at the Glen Eira Town Hall. Since 2024, the Council area is divided into nine wards, each electing a single councillor. The most recent election took place on 26 October 2024 and saw the following councillors elected:

<text>The A10 is a major road in England which runs between The City of London and King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk.

At its southern terminus, the route meets the A3 directly north of London Bridge, above Monument London Underground station. At its northern end, the A10 meets the A47 and A149 roads south-west of King&#x27;s Lynn town centre. The route passes through or around primary destinations in Greater London, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, including Dalston, Enfield, Hertford, Cambridge, Ely and Downham Market.

The route between Bishopsgate in the City of London and Royston, Hertfordshire, roughly follows the path of Ermine Street, a Roman road.

==Route==

=== City of London ===
At its southern end, the A10 begins at a junction with the A3, on the northern bank of the River Thames. The A3 runs southbound over London Bridge towards Elephant and Castle, before continuing to Clapham, Kingston upon Thames, Guildford and Portsmouth. At the junction the A10 also meets Cannon Street (towards St Pauls Cathedral and Blackfriars), King William Street (towards Bank) and Eastcheap (towards Tower Hill). Monument tube station on the Circle and District lines is directly below the junction. The Monument to the Great Fire of London is south-east of the junction.

Running north from the junction, the A10 is carried by Gracechurch Street, Bishopsgate and Norton Folgate. Liverpool Street station - the London terminus of the West Anglia Main Line (down to Enfield, Hertford, Stansted Airport and Cambridge) and the Great Eastern Main Line (down to Southend, Chelmsford, Ipswich and Norwich) - sits directly west of the A10 Bishopsgate. 22 Bishopsgate is the second-tallest building in London, and the tallest within The Square Mile.

=== Greater London ===
Leaving the City of London northbound, the A10 is carried by Shoreditch High Street. The route meets the A1202 Great Eastern Street/Commercial Street - the London Inner Ring Road - directly to the south-west of Shoreditch High Street London Overground station.

The London Inner Ring Road forms the boundary to the London Congestion Charge zone. The A10 falls within the charging zone between the A3 London Bridge and the ring road.

North from the ring road, the A10 is carried by Kingsland Road, Kingsland High Street and Stoke Newington Road, before meeting a gyratory in the Stoke Newington area (Stoke Newington High Street, Northwold Road, Rectory Road and Manse Road). The A10 continues along Stamford Hill, Tottenham High Road, Bruce Grove, Lordship Lane and The Roundway - a crescent around the original Tower Gardens Estate (Tottenham&#x27;s Garden Suburb), shared with the A1080.

The A10 passes Haggerston, Dalston Junction, Dalston Kingsland, Rectory Road, Stoke Newington, South Tottenham and Seven Sisters London Overground stations, and Seven Sisters tube station.

Northbound from The Roundway, the A10 is carried by Great Cambridge Road, a dual carriageway.

Along Great Cambridge Road, the A10 meets the A406 North Circular Road. Between A3 London Bridge and the North Circular Road, the A10 falls within the Ultra Low Emission Zone. The A10 then passes through Southbury, cutting between Edmonton and Enfield before meeting the M25 London Orbital motorway at junction 25 (the Greater London and London Low Emission Zone boundaries).

In Greater London and the City of London, the A10 is managed by Transport for London.

=== Hertfordshire ===
In Hertfordshire, leaving the M25 motorway junction, the A10 meets the A121 and B198 roads at a roundabout. Waltham Cross sits directly east of the route.

Continuing north, the A10 dual carriageway runs unbroken until Standon, passing Cheshunt, Broxbourne, Hoddesdon, Hertford, Ware and Wadesmill - through the Lea Valley. The route meets with the primary routes A414 (for Hertford town centre, Harlow and Chelmsford), A602 (for Stevenage) and the A120 (for Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Stansted Airport).

The dual carriageway then passes around the western perimeter of Puckeridge before becoming a single carriageway primary route near Westmill. The A10 becomes the Buntingford bypass, then continues north through Chipping, Buckland, Reed and Royston, to meet the A505 (for Baldock and Newmarket) at Hertfordshire&#x27;s border with Cambridgeshire. The A10 through Royston is a gyratory comprising Market Hill, Priory Lane and Barkway Street.

=== Cambridgeshire ===
The A10 has been split into two sections in Cambridgeshire.

The southern section runs between Royston and the M11 motorway at junction 11. The single-carriageway route passes between the villages of Meldreth and Melbourn, along the south-eastern edge of Shepreth and through Foxton, Harston and Hauxton. At the M11 junction 11, the A10 meets the A1309 which continues into Cambridge City Centre, past the Trumpington Park and Ride.

The northern section runs between the A14 at junction 33 (Milton Interchange) and the River Little Ouse. Access from the Milton Interchange into Cambridge is via the A1309 southbound, near Cambridge Science Park - which is directly south-west of the junction - and Cambridge North railway station.

Northbound from the A14, the A10 runs along the western edge of Milton, passing Milton Park and Ride. The route also passes Landbeach, Waterbeach, Stretham and Little Thetford, crossing the River Great Ouse between Waterbeach and Stretham.

South of Ely, the A10 meets the A142 (for Chatteris, Soham and Newmarket). The route forms the western bypass to the City of Ely and Littleport before crossing the River Great Ouse for a second time. The A10 runs along the eastern bank of the Ouse until Southery in Norfolk, entering the county near Black Horse Drove.

=== Norfolk ===
In Norfolk, the A10 passes Southery, Hilgay, Fordham, Denver, Downham Market, Tottenhill and West Winch before reaching the A47 (for Peterborough, Wisbech, Swaffham and Norwich). In Norfolk, the A10 meets the primary routes A1122 (for Wisbech and Swaffham) and A134 (for Thetford). The route also meets the A149 for Cromer and Hunstanton (known locally as The Coast Road), and King&#x27;s Lynn town centre.

==Major junctions==















== History ==

=== Ermine Street ===
Between The City of London and Royston, the A10 follows a similar course to the Ermine Street Roman road.

Ermine Street was one of the radial routes from &quot;Londinium&quot;, with its southern terminus at Bishopsgate - one of the gates in the ruined London Wall. The gate stood where the A10 intersects with the A1211 Wormwood Street/Camomile Street. It was demolished in 1760.

At Royston, where the A10 bears north-east towards Cambridge, Ermine Street crosses the Icknield Way (between Wiltshire and Norfolk).

North of Royston, Ermine Street runs north towards &quot;Durovigutum&quot; (Godmanchester), &quot;Lindum Colonia&quot; (Lincoln) and &quot;Eboracum&quot; (York).

Bishopsgate lends its name to the street carrying the A10 between Leadenhall Street and Spital Square.

The A10 carries the name Ermine Street between Buntingford and Buckland in Hertfordshire. Ermine Street also lends its name to a ward in the North Hertfordshire council area, which is crossed by the A10 London Road (south of Royston).

=== Road numbering ===
The A10 first featured in the Ministry of Transport List of Class I and Class II Roads and Numbers 1922-1923. According to The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts (SABRE) wiki, the A10 was designated the route London (Kingsland Road - Stamford Hill) - Tottenham - Ware - Royston - Cambridge - Ely - King&#x27;s Lynn.

The A10 is one of two routes designated to run between London and Cambridge - the other being the M11 &quot;London to Cambridge&quot; motorway. The southern terminus of the M11 links with the A406 North Circular Road and A12 in the Woodford area of the London Borough of Redbridge. The two routes meet at the M11 junction 11, west of Trumpington. The motorway opened between 1975 and 1980.

The 1922 A10 route has been bypassed several times, with new road numbers on the original route. These include:

* A1010 through Edmonton and Waltham Cross;
* A1170 through Wormley, Broxbourne, Hoddesdon, Great Amwell and Ware;
* A1309 through Trumpington, Cambridge and Chesterton.

<doc id="467276" wikidata="Q1445363" url="?curid=467276" title="City of Frankston">
<text>The City of Frankston (officially known as Frankston City Council&quot;)&quot; is a local government area (LGA) in Victoria, Australia in the southern suburbs of Melbourne. It has an area of 130 square kilometres, and in August 2021, the City of Frankston recorded a population of 139,281.

Despite its similar area and name, the City of Frankston is a different entity to the former City of Frankston which existed from 1966 until 1994, which was a continuation of the former Shire of Frankston and was abolished under state government reforms. This is similar to the situation for the Shire of South Gippsland and Shire of Glenelg, but is unlike the City of Melbourne, City of Knox, City of Whittlesea and City of Melton, whose administrations stayed intact through the amalgamations of the early 1990s.

==Geography==

The city is located on the eastern shores of Port Phillip, and is bounded on the north by the City of Kingston and the City of Greater Dandenong, on the east by the City of Casey, and on the south by the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. The boundaries of the city are defined largely on the north by Eel Race Road and Thompsons Road, on the east by the Dandenong-Hastings Road, and on the south by a complex boundary featuring Baxter-Tooradin Road, Golf Links Road and Humphries Road.

==History==

The Frankston City was created in 1994 out of the remains of three abolished councils – all but the suburbs of Mount Eliza, Baxter and Pearcedale from the former City of Frankston; the suburbs of Carrum Downs, Langwarrin and Skye from the City of Cranbourne; and part of Carrum Downs from the City of Springvale.

The major part of the city was first incorporated in 1860 as the Mornington Roads District, which became a shire in 1871 and was renamed Shire of Frankston and Hastings in 1893, losing its western riding to form the Shire of Mornington, which has since been amalgamated into the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. On 19 October 1960, the Shire of Frankston and Hastings split in two, with the western part remaining as the Shire of Frankston, and the eastern part being incorporated as the Shire of Hastings.

Frankston was officially proclaimed as a city on 24 August 1966, to be known as the City of Frankston in a ceremony attended by Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1993 the state government announced a major statewide program of local government amalgamations, most of which took effect on 15 December 1994. Most councils and their LGA&#x27;s were abolished with new ones being created to replace them.

Some changes occurred between the release of the Local Government Board report in July and the actual amalgamation – the original plan was to merge with the City of Chelsea and take Braeside and Carrum Downs from the City of Springvale. However, Frankston City Council submitted that it should expand eastwards instead, as well as taking Mount Eliza and Baxter. By October, the present boundaries had been agreed upon, but the new entity was to be known as the &quot;City of Nepean&quot;. This appeared in the Board&#x27;s final report in November 1994. Despite this recommendation, the State Government ultimately decided to retain a variation of the historical name, designating the new entity as Frankston City.

==Council==

The current council, as of November 2024, in order of wards, is:
