<text>Acornsoft was the software arm of Acorn Computers, and a major publisher of software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. As well as games, it also produced a large number of educational titles, extra computer languages and business and utility packages – these included word processor &quot;VIEW&quot; and the spreadsheet &quot;ViewSheet&quot; supplied on ROM and cartridge for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and included as standard in the BBC Master and Acorn Business Computer.

==History==
Acornsoft was formed in late 1980 by Acorn Computers directors Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry, and David Johnson-Davies, author of the first game for a UK personal computer and of the official Acorn Atom manual &quot;Atomic Theory and Practice&quot;. David Johnson-Davies was managing director and in early 1981 was joined by Tim Dobson, Programmer and Chris Jordan, Publications Editor.

While some of their games were clones or remakes of popular arcade games (e.g. &quot;Hopper&quot; is a clone of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot;, &quot;Snapper&quot; is Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Arcadians&quot; is Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaxian&quot;), they also published a number of original titles such as &quot;Aviator&quot;, &quot;Elite&quot;, and &quot;Revs&quot;. Acornsoft also published text adventures by authors such as Peter Killworth, including &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Quest&quot; (previously titled &quot;Brand X&quot;) and &quot;Countdown to Doom&quot;.

As a result of the publication of a method to circumvent copy protection measures employed by Acornsoft titles, a High Court injunction against Computing Publications - publisher of Personal Computer World - was granted to Acorn Computers &quot;requiring all copies of the January 1984 issue of PCW to be withdrawn from sale&quot;, with the article concerned being regarded as inciting readers to &quot;duplicate computer programs&quot;. This injunction was subsequently lifted as a consequence of an out-of-court settlement between the parties involving a damages payment of £65,000 plus costs to Acorn &quot;to meet Acorn&#x27;s expenses in developing a new locking device&quot;. The article&#x27;s author, Guy Kewney, and the magazine&#x27;s editor, Jane Bird, argued that printing a software routine showing how to save Acornsoft cassette software to disk was a service to the magazine&#x27;s readers. The cost of printing the magazine issue concerned was estimated at £100,000.

Acornsoft became a subsidiary within Acorn Computer Group, distinct from Acorn Computers who were responsible for the development of Acorn&#x27;s microcomputer systems, but Acornsoft ceased to operate as a separate company upon the departure of David Johnson-Davies in January 1986. Past this date, Acorn Computers used the Acornsoft name on office software it released in the &quot;VIEW&quot; family for the BBC Master series. In 1986 Superior Software was granted a licence to publish some Acornsoft games and re-released many, individually and as compilations such as the &quot;Play It Again Sam&quot; and &quot;Acornsoft Hits&quot; series. By agreement, the Acornsoft name was also used on the packaging of some of the subsequent Superior games. Superior chose not to take on Acornsoft&#x27;s text adventure games, most of which were released in updated versions by Topologika along with some sequels from the same authors.

In 1997, Acorn sought to revive the Acornsoft brand for new software releases, such as upgrades to RISC OS, programming tools, a new Web browser, multitasking movie playback (using Acorn Replay), and Java for RISC OS. A stated objective was to demonstrate that a &quot;wide range of innovative software at competitive prices&quot; was available for RISC OS, with support also being potentially offered to third-party software producers. Acornsoft products themselves would be supported by marketing, including advertising, and the provision of press review samples.

Acornsoft also published and distributed a range of educational software developed by ASK (Applied Systems Knowledge) that were widely used in schools running BBC Micros. These included &quot;Podd&quot; (find out which actions a red blobby character can perform (e.g. jump, smile, dance), &quot;Squeeze&quot; (a two player strategy game of squeezing shapes onto a board) and &quot;Cranky&quot; (solve maths problems to repair a living calculator). These titles were part of the Acornsoft catalogue but used a different code (XBE?? – all other Acornsoft titles began with S so the Education range on BBC Micro cassettes would be SBE??). They ran on both the BBC Micro Model B and Acorn Electron.

The &quot;Ivan Berg Software&quot; range was also mainly educational but had its own distinct code (XBX??). This included the 6 &quot;Grandmaster Quiz&quot;zes (Theatre, Crime &amp; Detection, Music, History, Science Fiction and Royal), relationship aids &quot;&quot;..I Do&quot; Your Guide to a Happy Marriage&quot; and &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and GCE/CSE revision guides (Mathematics, Biology and English).

Acornsoft also distributed other ranges of educational programs developed by companies such as ICL, Good Housekeeping and Bourne but they are not considered part of the official catalogue.

==Acornsoft Business range==
Acornsoft produced a range of office software for home and business use.

*B01 Desk Diary (&quot;BBC&quot; 198?, &quot;Electron&quot; 1984)

*B26 P-System (&quot;BBC with 6502 Second Processor&quot;)

The series continues but mainly with add-on products for the &quot;VIEW&quot; word processor such as &quot;ViewIndex&quot; (an automatic index generator) and &quot;ViewSpell&quot; (spell-checker) as well as newer versions.

View Professional (1987) was a combined wordprocessor, spreadsheet and database similar to PipeDream on the Z88.

Although primarily a programming language suite, Acornsoft released its P-System product featuring UCSD Pascal and Fortran 77 compilers as part of its business range. Developed by TDI for Acornsoft, the product required a 6502 second processor and disc system, preferably with two drives. Despite the £299 price, various tools including an assembler and linker were omitted from the product, these being made available in a separate Advanced Development Toolkit from TDI.

==Acornsoft Languages range==
Acorn systems came with a version of the BBC BASIC programming language as standard but Acornsoft also produced a wide range of other languages that could be loaded in by cassette or disc or in some cases, supplied in ROM form.

*L01 FORTH (&quot;BBC&quot; 1982, &quot;Electron&quot; 1983)
*L02 &quot;LISP&quot; (&quot;BBC&quot; 1982, &quot;Electron&quot; 1983, &quot;Electron&quot; ROM cartridge 1984)
*L03 BCPL (&quot;BBC&quot; 1983)
*L04 Microtext (&quot;BBC&quot; 1983)
*L05 6502 Development System (&quot;BBC&quot; 1985)

*L16
*L17 PROLOG Micro (&quot;BBC&quot; 1985)
*L18 ISO-Pascal (&quot;BBC&quot; 1984, &quot;Electron&quot; ROM cartridge 1985)
*L19 COMAL (&quot;BBC&quot; 1984).
*L20
*L21
*L22 BASIC Editor (&quot;BBC&quot; 1985)
*L23 Termulator (&quot;BBC&quot; 1987)
*L24 ISO-Pascal Stand Alone Generator (&quot;BBC&quot; 198?)

The relative performance of some of Acornsoft&#x27;s languages was evaluated using a benchmark based on the Takeuchi function, &quot;Tak&quot; by former Acornsoft managing director, David Johnson-Davies, noting that &quot;it is difficult to imagine a language that performs badly on &quot;Tak&quot; being much use for anything&quot;, illustrating a diversity amongst these language implementations in terms of readability, speed and generated code size. A follow-up article expanded the comparison to other language implementations such as Oxford Pascal, Z80 versions of BBC BASIC, Turbo Pascal and Small-C.

==Acornsoft Graphics range and more==
The graphics range was used to demonstrate the graphical power of the Acorn computers but only three titles were made available. The X?? code was then used for other types of software.

*X01 Creative Graphics (&quot;BBC&quot; 198?, &quot;Electron&quot; 1983)

<text>Charles L. Forgy (born December 12, 1949, in Texas) is an American computer scientist, known for developing the Rete algorithm used in his OPS5 and other production system languages used to build expert systems.

== Early life and education ==
Forgy attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas, and then advanced to Arlington State College (now University of Texas at Arlington, or UTA) graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1972. From there he went to Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, a renowned center for study of artificial intelligence. While studying at Carnegie he met his future wife, Diana, whom he married in 1977.

==Career==
=== Rete ===
As a student of Allen Newell, he received his Ph.D. in 1979 based on the Rete algorithm. Even though Forgy did not work directly on the DEC XCON AI problem of configuring computers for DEC in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Rete algorithm was later incorporated into the system for more speed. The XCON used the early versions of OPS (Official Production System) that migrated to OPS2 and later OPS5.

DEC reported that XCON saved at least $1M USD per year. XCON, a project headed up by John McDermott and later transferred to DEC programmers, was eventually composed of over 10K rules. The Rete (Latin for &quot;network&quot;) algorithm allowed systems to run as much as 3,000 times faster in those days. The original Rete algorithm was developed under a Department of Defence grant and, as such, is public domain.

===Rete II and III===
Forgy remained at Carnegie Mellon post-graduation and worked on further improvements to OPS5; in 1983 he formed a company called Production Systems Technologies to develop and sell rule-based software, where he developed &quot;Rete II&quot;, a more efficient successor to Rete. Rete II enabled rule-based programs to run between 50 and 100 times faster than the original Rete algorithm, depending on the complexity of the rules and objects. (The more complex, the faster the comparative results.) Rete II is incorporated in CLIPS/R2, OPSJ and FICO&#x27;s Blaze Advisor.

Forgy was a founder and chief scientist for Rules Power, a Work Flow Management company founded in 2002 and based in Boston. During that time, Forgy incorporated Rete II with Relational Logic Technology, which became named &quot;Rete III&quot;. The performance of Rete II and Rete III are virtually the same but Rete III has some extensions that allow it to work more efficiently with Relational Logic Technology but slows it down on benchmarks.

===Rete-NT===

Forgy developed a next-generation algorithm, called Rete-NT, that has improved the execution speed by another order of magnitude. To this date Sparkling Logic SMARTS is the only BRMS product that uses this algorithm.

===Present times===
In 2005, RulesPower was acquired by Fair Isaac Corporation, who obtained a license to integrate Rete III into Blaze Advisor, their own business rules product.

Forgy retained the intellectual property rights to Rete II and his personal company, Production Systems Technology, still sells OPSJ and other systems that incorporate the Rete II algorithm. KnowledgeBased Systems Corporation, an independent consulting company in Texas, maintains an extensive set of benchmarks for most BRMS and rule-based systems that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rete and Rete II algorithms. Forgy has often described PST as a research-oriented company rather than a vendor of BRMS tools, but he does sell various rule-based tools via PST.

Forgy terminated his relationship with FICO in 2010 and joined Sparkling Logic as investor and strategic advisor. He has contributed his latest algorithm, Rete-NT, to the Sparkling Logic SMARTS product.

<text>The NAACP Image Awards is an annual awards ceremony presented by the U.S.-based National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to honor outstanding performances in film, television, theatre, music, and literature. The over 40 categories of the Image Awards are voted on by the NAACP members. Honorary awards (similar to the Academy Honorary Award) have also been included, such as the President&#x27;s Award, the Chairman&#x27;s Award, the Entertainer of the Year, the Activist of the Year, and the Hall of Fame Award. Beyoncé is the All-Time leading winner with 25 wins as a solo artist.

==History==
The award ceremony was conceived by Toni Vaz during an April 1967 NAACP branch meeting in Beverly Hills. “I called it the Image Awards because I wanted a better image for the people who worked in the industry,” Vaz said. “I wanted to put this award show together to thank the producers for giving good roles to people of color.” The branch president liked the idea, Vaz said, but when she made follow-up calls to members and friends to enlist volunteers for an awards show committee, no one volunteered. Vaz reached out to Black A-listers such as Sammy Davis Jr., who hosted the first meeting of the NAACP Beverly Hills Hollywood Branch in his home; Sidney Poitier, whom she had worked with on the movie Porgy and Bess; and the late Ivan Dixon, an actor, director and producer of Hogan&#x27;s Heroes at the time. Vaz also wrote letters to secure sponsors for the event and booked the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the first NAACP Image Awards show was held on August 13, 1967.

The ceremony was presented by activists Maggie Hathaway, Sammy Davis Jr. and Willis Edwards, all three of whom were leaders of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP branch. While it was first taped for television by NBC (which broadcast the awards from 1987 to 1994 in January, on weeks when &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; wasn&#x27;t airing a new episode), it would only be broadcast in primetime beginning in 1996. Due to changes in timing of the awards, there was no awards ceremony held the following years: 1973, as the timing was changed to honor a full calendar year early in the following year (reverted to a &quot;late-in-year&quot; ceremony for 1981–1990); 1991, as the timing returned too late in a calendar year to honor that same year; 1995.

The first live broadcast of the awards, also on the Fox Network, occurred in 2007 for its 38th edition (up until 2007, the ceremony had been broadcast with tape delay) and the annual ceremonies usually take place in or around the Los Angeles area, in February or early March. The 44th edition aired on NBC. Sources have had trouble verifying the winners in the top categories from 1983 to 1995.

The New York firm Society Awards manufactures the trophy since its redesign in 2008.

=== Cultural impact ===
The NAACP Image awards has been widely accepted and dubbed as the &quot;&quot;Black&quot; &quot;Oscars/Emmy/Grammy&quot;&quot; award show from the African-American and Latino community, as it is an important prestigious award celebrating artists and entertainers of color that may have been overlooked from by the mainstream film, television, theater and music award counterparts (E.G.O.T.) due to racial seclusion or lack of interests from film and television studios. Whereas, it created more exposure for content on a wide spectrum of urban media versus other awards shows where they can be celebrated and appreciated. Actors such as Will Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Taraji P. Henson and many others expressed the differences of not being visually seen by the industry&#x27;s standard and how artists and entertainers should look to the NAACP Image Awards as the highest achievement. The campaign of #OscarSoWhite began as a protest after seeing the lack of people of color being nominated or win in major categories at the Academy Awards. Since then, minor adjustments have been made for inclusion as more people of color have become nominated and win at the mainstream prestigious award ceremonies. Today, the NAACP Image Awards is what many people of color look forward to as &quot;the one that matters&quot;.

==Controversies==
In 1987, the NAACP came under fire for dropping their Best Actress award for that year. They defended this position, citing a lack of meaningful roles for Black women. In 1990, they were criticized once again for not awarding Best Actress. This was the fourth time it could not find enough nominees for Best Actress. Sandra Evers-Manly, president of the organization&#x27;s Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch, said, &quot;The [film] industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for African-American women.&quot;

In several instances, nominees have been perceived as “undeserving” or “unworthy” of recognition by members of the media, fellow celebrities, as well as the general public; in their own defense, some NAACP representatives have stated that the overall quality of an artist&#x27;s work is the salient issue. This would render certain factors, such as criminal charges or the nominee&#x27;s past, being inconsequential in this regard. For example, in 1994, rapper Tupac Shakur was nominated for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture (for &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;), despite sexual assault charges being filed against him in December 1993. Furthermore, Shakur had been accused of felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in New York City; a woman alleged that he and two male accomplices held her captive, in a hotel room, and restricted her movements, holding her down as a fourth accomplice sodomized her. Shakur was also indicted for two counts of aggravated assault, in an unrelated incident, in which he supposedly shot and wounded two off-duty police officers. The same year, Martin Lawrence was criticized for winning Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series for &quot;Martin&quot;, after the show was maligned for its sexual content. In 2004, R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate Factory&quot; was nominated for Outstanding Album while he was under indictment for charges related to child pornography.

Other nominees have faced controversy due to their portrayals of major civil rights figures. In 2003, the comedy film &quot;Barbershop&quot; received five nominations, including Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Supporting Actor (for Cedric the Entertainer&#x27;s performance); during the film, Cedric&#x27;s character makes pejorative remarks about Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., Michael Jackson, and Jesse Jackson. This content elicited criticism, including Parks&#x27; refusal to attend the ceremony. Hip-hop group OutKast received six nominations in 2004, and criticism soon followed—for both them and the NAACP—due to the name of one of their songs being “Rosa Parks”. The song had resulted in Parks suing OutKast for defamation over use of her name.

<text>United States Objectives and Programs for National Security, better known as NSC68, was a 66-page top secret U.S. National Security Council (NSC) policy paper drafted by the Department of State and Department of Defense and presented to President Harry S. Truman on 7 April 1950. It was one of the most important American policy statements of the Cold War. In the words of scholar Ernest R. May, NSC68 &quot;provided the blueprint for the militarization of the Cold War from 1950 to the collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s.&quot; NSC68 and its subsequent amplifications advocated a large expansion in the military budget of the United States, the development of a hydrogen bomb, and increased military aid to allies of the United States. It made the rollback of global Communist expansion a high priority and rejected the alternative policies of détente and containment of the Soviet Union.

By 1950, U.S. national security policies required reexamination due to a series of events: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was operational, military assistance for European allies had begun, the Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb and the communists had solidified their control of China. In addition, a British sterling-dollar crisis in the summer of 1949 had brought home to U.S. officials that the Marshall Plan would not suffice to cure Western European economic ills by 1952, the Plan&#x27;s scheduled end year, with the prospect that Western Europe would have no choice but to pursue autarky, as it had in the 1930s, with all the attendant difficulties that would pose for the world economy generally and the U.S. economy particularly. Similar problems were also plaguing Japan. With these threats to the U.S. and its allies expanding, on 31 January 1950 President Truman directed the Department of State and Department of Defense &quot;to undertake a reexamination of our objectives in peace and war and of the effect of these objectives on our strategic plans.&quot; A State-Defense Policy Review Group was set up under the chairmanship of Paul Nitze of the State Department.

Nitze, an advocate of rollback, ensured that only the most severe claims about the Soviet Union were cited in the document. The analysis of top Kremlin experts like George Kennan, Llewellyn Thompson, and Charles Bohlen, were categorically omitted. The Kennan–Thompson–Bohlen group maintained that Stalin&#x27;s principal goal was to secure tight control of the USSR and its satellites, but that he had no plan to seek global domination (an assessment shared by most historians today). Nitze however, contended that the Soviets were determined to conquer the whole of Europe and most of Asia and Africa. Dean Acheson, another hawkish adviser to Truman, wrote that the purpose of NSC 68 was to &quot;bludgeon the mind of top government that not only could the president make a decision, but that the decision could be carried out.&quot;

The Defense Department representatives on the committee initially resisted proposals that would exceed the existing $12.5 billion ceiling on defense spending.

The report, designated NSC68, was presented to President Truman on 7 April 1950, who passed it on to the NSC for further consideration on 12 April 1950.

NSC Study Group:
* Paul Nitze, Chair
* John P. Davis
* Robert Tufts
* Robert Hooker
* Dean Acheson
* Charles E. Bohlen
* Major General Truman Landon, Joint Chiefs Representative
* Samuel S. Butano
* Robert Lovett, Deputy Secretary of Defense
Originally, President Truman did not support NSC68 when it was brought to him in 1950. He believed that it was not specific about which programs would be affected or changed and it also did not go well with his previous defense spending limits. Truman sent it back for further review until he finally approved it in 1951.

The document outlined the de facto national security strategy of the United States for that time (although it was not an official National Security Strategy in the form known today) and analyzed the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States of America from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints.

NSC 68 described the challenges facing the United States in cataclysmic terms. &quot;The issues that face us are momentous,&quot; the document stated, &quot;involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself.&quot;

The document was declassified in 1975.

==Content and meaning==
NSC68 saw the goals and aims of the United States as sound, yet poorly implemented, calling &quot;present programs and plans... dangerously inadequate&quot;. Although George F. Kennan&#x27;s theory of containment articulated a multifaceted approach for U.S. foreign policy in response to the perceived Soviet threat, the report recommended policies that emphasized military over diplomatic action. Kennan&#x27;s influential 1947 &quot;X&quot; article advocated a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union. It described containment as &quot;a policy of calculated and gradual coercion&quot; and called for significant peacetime military spending, in which the U.S. possessed &quot;superior overall power ... in dependable combination with other like-minded nations.&quot; In particular, it called for a military capable of
* Defending the Western Hemisphere and essential allied areas so that their war-making capabilities could be developed;
* Providing and protecting a mobilization base while the offensive forces required for victory were being built up;
* Conducting offensive operations to destroy vital elements of the Soviet war-making capacity, and to keep the enemy off balance until the full offensive strength of the United States and its allies could be brought to bear;
* Defending and maintaining the lines of communication and base areas necessary to the execution of the above tasks; and
* Providing such aid to allies as would be essential to the execution of their role in the above tasks.

NSC68 itself did not contain any specific cost estimates at a time when the United States was committing six to seven percent of its GNP to defense. It was evident that the limits the President had previously set on defense spending were too low. The report called for tripling defense spending to $40 or $50 billion per year from the original $13 billion set for 1950. It specified a reduction of taxes and a &quot;reduction of Federal expenditures for purposes other than defense and foreign assistance, if necessary by the deferment of certain desirable programs&quot;, as a means for paying for it. However, several officials involved in the preparation of the study, including the future chairman of the president&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers Leon Keyserling, suggested that the massive increase in military spending could be afforded by deliberate acceptance of government deficits, which would have the added benefit of energising and stimulating parts of the American economy, as it did after 1930. Indeed, the document did note that achieving a high gross national product &quot;might itself be aided by a build-up of the economic and military strength of the United States,&quot; and the Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett also suggested that the American economy &quot;might benefit from the kind of build-up we are suggesting&quot;. The memorandum saw that the United States would grow exponentially with the added funding towards the military. The added funding would strengthen the current military, causing the Soviet Union to strengthen its military as well. However, since both superpowers had different economies, outcomes from this would differ greatly. They understood that the Soviet Union&#x27;s output was nearly half of the United States&#x27; current output, so they assumed it was only a matter of time before the Soviet Union could not keep up. Understanding communism, they knew that the USSR was already producing at full capacity. There are four variables that determine output: consumption, investment, government expenditure, and exports. In order to increase military strength, the USSR would be forced to allocate resources from other avenues such as investment or consumption. Deprive investments and the country&#x27;s economic growth would become stagnant. Deprive consumption and that would cause further civil unrest and lower the quality of life of its citizens. On the other hand, the United States did not run into the problem the Soviets did. What came from NSC-68 was an economic ideology that dominated the United States economy for the majority of the Cold War, Military Keynesianism. Economists assumed that the United States normally operated below production capacity. This assumption proved essential to the United States victory of military strength since the increase of government expenditure would place the nation at capacity. However, unlike the USSR, the United States economy would grow since it would be increasing its production.

==Relation to U.S. foreign policy==
The argument is made that if the Soviet sphere of influence continues to grow, it may become such a powerful force, that no coalition of nations could band together and defeat it. The implication was that militarization is needed for American self-preservation. In other words, the aggressive nature of Soviet expansion required a strong response from the U.S. to prevent the destruction of America. This was phrased in a context of military exploits (referring to the military victory in World War I and World War II), and therefore emphasized military expansion.

Also crucial in understanding this document is the language. Primary sources must be read carefully to recognize themes or motifs. Adjectives provide valuable insight into the motives of this document&#x27;s authors, and the impression it had on its intended audience. An example is the description of the international situation, as provoked by the Soviet Union, as endemic. By using this language, it is clear that the authors wished to portray the Soviet Union as a sickness, and the U.S. as the cure. This message was received loud and clear, and dominated many foreign policy decisions throughout the Cold War.

==Internal debate==

NSC68 drew some criticism from senior government officials who believed the Cold War was being escalated unnecessarily. When the report was sent to top officials in the Truman administration for review before its official delivery to the President, many of them scoffed at its arguments. Willard Thorp questioned its contention that the &quot;USSR is steadily reducing the discrepancy between its overall economic strength and that of the United States.&quot; Thorp argued: &quot;I do not feel that this position is demonstrated, but rather the reverse... The actual gap is widening in our favor.&quot; He pointed out that in 1949 the US economy had increased twofold over that of the Soviet Union. Steel production in the US outpaced the Soviet Union by 2 million tons; stockpiling of goods and oil production both far exceeded Soviet amounts. As for Soviet military investment, Thorp was skeptical that the USSR was committing such large portion of its GDP: &quot;I suspect a larger portion of Soviet investment went into housing.&quot; William Schaub of the Bureau of the Budget was particularly harsh, believing that &quot;in every arena,&quot; the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, the stockpiling of atomic bombs, the economy, the US was far superior to the Soviet Union. Kennan, although &quot;father&quot; of the containment policy, also disagreed with the document, particularly its call for massive rearmament (FRUS, 1950, Vol. I).

===Truman&#x27;s position===
President Harry S. Truman, even after the Soviets became a nuclear power, sought to curb military spending. However, he did not reject the recommendations of NSC68 out of hand, but instead requested more information i.e. asking for an estimate of the costs involved. In the ensuing two months, little progress was made on the report. By June, Nitze had practically given up on it. But on 25 June 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel north. With the Korean War begun, NSC68 took on new importance. As Acheson later remarked: &quot;Korea... created the stimulus which made action.&quot;

===Public opinion===
The Truman Administration began a nationwide public relations campaign to convince Congress and opinion-setters of the need for strategic rearmament and containment of Soviet communism. It had to overcome isolationists, including Senator Robert A. Taft, who wanted less world involvement, as well as intense anti-Communists such as James Burnham who proposed an alternative strategy of rollback that would eliminate Communism or perhaps launch a preemptive war. The State Department and the White House used the North Korean attack of June 1950 and the see-saw battles during the first few months of the Korean War to steer congressional and public opinion toward a course of rearmament between the two poles of preventive war and isolationism.

==Historical debate==
NSC68 is a source of much historical debate as is the escalation of the Cold War. As Ken Young, a historian of the early Cold War period, has stated, &quot;The report has been subject to continuous analysis and commentary. ... Even though NSC 68 appeared in the midpoint of the twentieth century, it retains singular meaning in the 21st.&quot;

It was an important part of an overall shift in American foreign policy to a comprehensive containment strategy that was confirmed by successive administrations. In 1962 scholar Paul Y. Hammond presented the first detailed, contemporary, interviews-based account of the formation of NSC68. Subsequent analyses range from Michael Hogan&#x27;s belief that NSC68 portrayed the threat &quot;in the worst light possible&quot; to those believing NSC68 provided an accurate picture of a genuine and growing threat.

Cold War expert Melvyn Leffler describes the characterization of the Soviet threat in the document as &quot;hyperbolic&quot; and a precursor to contemporary rhetoric on the &quot;war on terror.&quot; He claims the language &quot;blurred important distinctions, distorted priorities and complicated threat perception.&quot;

==Conclusion==
This document is critical to understanding the Cold War with its effect on similar national security pronouncements such as President George W. Bush&#x27;s announcement of a &quot;War on Terror&quot; in September 2001 and the National Security Strategy document of 2002. It is not only related to documents such as the National Security Strategy March 2005, but also provides insight to current US foreign policy. Implementation of NSC68 shows the extent to which it marked a &#x27;shift&#x27; in US policy—not only toward the USSR, but toward all communist governments. By signing the document, Truman provided a clearly defined and coherent US policy that did not really exist previously. Furthermore, it can be argued that NSC68, as proposed by the council, addressed Truman&#x27;s problem of being attacked from the right following the &quot;red scare&quot; and Alger Hiss case. Although not made public, NSC68 was manifested in subsequent increases in America&#x27;s conventional and nuclear capabilities, thereby adding to the country&#x27;s financial burden. While NSC68 did not make any specific recommendations regarding the proposed increase in defense expenditures, the Truman Administration almost tripled defense spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product between 1950 and 1953 (from 5 to 14.2 percent).

<text>Dee Ward Hock (March 21, 1929 – July 16, 2022) was the founder and CEO of the Visa credit card association.

== Early life and education ==
Hock was born in North Ogden, Utah, in 1929 to a Mormon family. His father, Alma, was a utility lineman, and his mother, Cecil, was a homemaker. Hock attended Weber State University, where he graduated with a two-year degree in 1949.

== Career ==
After graduation, Hock began working various jobs in the financial services industry. He served as the manager of two Pacific Finance branches, an assistant manager of public relations and advertising for Pacific Finance, a general manager of Columbia Investment Company, and then as a supervisor at CIT Financial. In 1966, he was hired by National Bank of Commerce, a local bank in Seattle, Washington. In 1967, he began managing the bank&#x27;s credit card brand, BankAmericard, which was being licensed from Bank of America. Through a series of unlikely accidents, Hock helped invent and became chief executive of the credit system that became Visa Inc. Early on, he convinced Bank of America to give up ownership and control of their BankAmericard credit card licensing program, forming a new company, National BankAmerica, that was owned by its member banks. The name was changed to Visa in 1976.

In May 1984, Hock resigned his management role with Visa, retiring to spend almost ten years in relative isolation working a ranch on the Pacific coast to the west of Silicon Valley in Pescadero, California. He was inducted into Junior Achievement&#x27;s U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1991, and the &quot;Money&quot; magazine hall of fame in 1992.

In his 1991 Business Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Hock explained:
Hock had built Visa as a deliberately decentralized organization. In March 1993, Hock gave a dinner speech at the Santa Fe Institute where, based on his experiences founding and operating Visa International, he described systems that are both chaotic and ordered, using the term &quot;chaordic&quot; from the words &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;order&quot;.

In February 1994, Hock accepted a grant from the Joyce Foundation for his travel expenses to study the possibilities of implementing chaordic organizations. The non-profit Alliance for Community Liberty was formed in 1994 by Hock to develop, disseminate and implement these new concepts of organization, and was renamed The Chaordic Alliance in 1996.In spring 2001, The Chaordic Commons, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, was formed to supersede the Chaordic Alliance. 

==Impact on organization development==
In addition to his career in the financial industry, Hock has been active in developing new models of social and business organization. He has been particularly interested in forms of organization that are neither rigidly controlled nor anarchic, a hybrid form he terms &quot;chaordic&quot;.

Hock has authored a book on the subject, &quot;Birth of the Chaordic Age&quot; (1999) with an edition named &quot;One from Many: VISA and the Rise of Chaordic Organization&quot; (2005) which includes two new chapters.

== Personal life ==
Hock married his high school girlfriend, Ferol Delors Cragun, when he was 20. She died in 2018. Hock died on July 16, 2022, at the age of 93. At the time of his death, he was survived by two children, seven grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren.

<text>The News was an afternoon daily tabloid newspaper in the city of Adelaide, South Australia, that had its origins in 1869, and ceased circulation in 1992. Through much of the 20th century, &quot;The Advertiser&quot; was Adelaide&#x27;s morning broadsheet, &quot;The News&quot; the afternoon tabloid, with &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot; covering weekend sport, and &quot;Messenger Newspapers&quot; community news.

Its former names were The Evening Journal (1869–1912) and The Journal (1912–1923), with the Saturday edition called The Saturday Journal until 1929.

== History ==
=== &quot;The Evening Journal&quot; ===
&quot;The News&quot; began as &quot;The Evening Journal&quot;, with Vol. I No. I issued on 2 January 1869. From 11 September 1912 (Vol. XLVI No. 12,906), it was renamed &quot;The Journal.&quot;

News Limited was established in 1923 by James Edward Davidson, when he purchased the Broken Hill &quot;Barrier Miner&quot; and the Port Pirie &quot;Recorder&quot;. He then went on to purchase &quot;The Journal&quot; and Adelaide&#x27;s weekly sports-focussed &quot;Mail&quot; in May 1923.

===&quot;The News&quot;===
On 24 July 1923, &quot;The Journal&quot; was renamed &quot;The News&quot; (restarting at Volume 1, Issue 1), with the Saturday edition being retained as &quot;The Saturday Journal&quot; (which continued to be published until 1929). In 1923, the new newspaper had a circulation of 30,000, and by 1953, it had a daily readership of 106,000. In early 1948, the regular format was changed from broadsheet to tabloid.

In 1933, a controlling stake was taken by &quot;The Advertiser&quot; and managed by &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot;. &quot;HWT&quot; sold off its stake in 1949, allowing Sir Keith Murdoch to acquire a major interest in the company and to assume control of the paper in 1951. &quot;The News&quot; became the main asset passed upon his death in 1952 to his son Rupert Murdoch. It was the latter&#x27;s first media interest and commenced the foundation of what was to become the international media conglomerate, News Corporation. On 6 February 1954, &quot;The Mail&quot; was renamed &quot;SA Sunday Mail&quot; and then &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; in 1955. On 28 August 1976, the final Saturday issue of &quot;The News&quot; was published.

Murdoch later acquired the city&#x27;s other local newspaper, the morning daily broadsheet, &quot;The Advertiser,&quot; in 1987. Murdoch sold &quot;The News&quot; that year to Northern Star Holdings, and many of its journalists moved to &quot;The Advertiser&quot;. However, in the face of continuing losses brought about by the competition of television and the decline of use of public transport and given the more prominent existence of &quot;The Advertiser,&quot; &quot;The News&quot; (then Australia’s last evening newspaper) was stopped on 27 March 1992.

<doc id="476040" wikidata="Q8546656" url="?curid=476040" title="Hurley, Berkshire">
<text>Hurley is a village and rural civil parish in Berkshire, England. Its riverside is agricultural, except for Hurley Priory, as are the outskirts of the village. The Olde Bell Inn adjoining the priory is believed to date from 1135.

==Topography==
Hurley is a linear development perpendicular to and adjoining the Upper Thames NW of Maidenhead and ENE of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire on the A4130. The parish includes the hamlets of Cockpole Green, Warren Row, Knowl Hill, Burchett&#x27;s Green and part of Littlewick Green. Ashley Hill Forest, almost south of the village, is close to and almost equidistant between Warren Row, Knowl Hill and Burchett&#x27;s Green and is the largest woodland. Other than this, the parish is mainly agricultural; however, many farms have spinneys of woodland adjoining.

==Historic structures==
* By the river is Hurley Priory, a partially moated Benedictine priory founded in 1086 as a cell of Westminster Abbey. The priory was dissolved in 1536, but its priory church survives as the current parish church and is a Scheduled Monument. 
* &#x27;The Olde Bell&#x27; Inn is reputedly the oldest still-working inn in Britain; parts of the inn date to 1135, when it was the hostelry of the priory. 
* The old manor estate of Hall Place (1728) is now the home of Berkshire College of Agriculture. 
*The Manor House in the High Street was used as Station Victor, forming part of Operation Sussex, the running of agents in occupied Europe by the American OSS.
* The former main priory building became a mansion known as Ladye Place, which stood adjoining the present parish church. It was the home of the Barons Lovelace. It was demolished in 1837 as uninhabitable.
* The Grassland Research Institute (GRI) also had a facility at Hurley until 1992.

==Localities==
===Hurley Bottom===
Only one of the buildings at the foot of the hill in the south of the village street is listed. This southerly neighbourhood has the local name of Hurley Bottom but is higher than the riverside parts of the village.

===Frogmill Court and Frogmill Spinney===
The early 19th-century Frogmill Court is now a farmhouse adjoining the river, which in this parish consists of mainly grazing and pasture meadows. The farmhouse is Grade II listed. Frogmill Spinney forms a riverside park housing estate. Another group of riverside homes are accessed by a separate lane.

==Recreation==
Hurley is often used as a mooring for leisure craft and by campers. Cricket has been played in Hurley for over 100 years. The club currently plays in the Chiltern League on Saturdays and friendly fixtures against local rivals on Sundays. The ground has a London plane tree inside the boundary. The clubhouse was rebuilt in the 1970s after fire destroyed the previous wooden one. The Temple Golf Club was founded in 1909 and is recognised for its &quot;picturesque [..] Thames valley views&quot;.

==In popular culture==

* The composer William Crotch was also an artist, and completed the drawing &quot;View from Hurley Bottom&quot; on 30 August 1806.

* The village is mentioned in the 1889 comic novel &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome
* The village is the setting for &quot;The Invisible Millionaire&quot;, a short story in the Saint series by Leslie Charteris.

==Public transport==
The village is served by a bus route from Maidenhead. Closest railway stations are Marlow, and Henley approximately four miles north east, south east and west respectively.

<doc id="476043" wikidata="Q5026549" url="?curid=476043" title="Camile Velasco">
<text>Ciara-Camile &quot;Camile&quot; Roque Velasco (born September 1, 1985), known by her stage name Eli-Mac, is a Filipino American singer and came in ninth place on the third season of the reality/talent-search television series &quot;American Idol&quot;. She is one-quarter Irish, one-quarter Spanish, and half Filipino.

==Early life==
Born in Makati, Philippines, Camile Velasco&#x27;s family later moved to Haiku, Maui, Hawaii. Prior to American Idol, Velasco was a struggling songwriter/composer who worked at her parents&#x27; IHOP Restaurant in Kahului.

== Career ==
=== &quot;American Idol&quot; 3 contestant ===
In 2003, Velasco auditioned for &quot;American Idol&quot; in Honolulu, Oahu and was unanimously accepted by the judges for her rendition of the chorus and bridge of &quot;Ready or Not&quot;—a Delfonics-sampled classic by the Fugees.

In the Hollywood round, Velasco sang several songs solo and performed &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; in a group. She was eventually advanced to the Top 32, in the second group of semi-finalists. Before she left the stage, Randy Jackson requested that she infuse more of her hip-hop style into her next performance. Velasco was as the top vote-getter in her group and advanced to the finals.

On &quot;American Idol&quot;, Velasco&#x27;s trademark was a red, yellow and green Rasta wristband, which she continually wore on her left wrist. Velasco also wore the &quot;3rd Eye Vision&quot; logo of the Hieroglyphics, a San Francisco Bay Area hip-hop crew, on several occasions.

Vocally, Velasco was classified as being &quot;hip-hop&quot;—a culture and style she identified with (but was not limited to). In the competition, she was compared with Lauryn Hill. In the Top 12 finals she sang &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;.

=== Leaving &quot;American Idol&quot; ===
Velasco was eliminated from &quot;American Idol&quot; on April 7, 2004. She, Diana DeGarmo and Jasmine Trias, a fellow Filipino-American, had received the fewest votes during Elton John week. Velasco seemed to anticipate her departure. Velasco kept her composure as her name was announced, but began to cry during her dedication video. As the show ended, the remaining finalists encircled her in an embrace.

When Velasco&#x27;s friend, Fantasia Barrino, won the competition, the Top 10 of &quot;American Idol&quot; 3 began to prepare for a US tour, sponsored by Pop Tarts, which would consist of more than fifty shows across the country, and a few overseas. On the tour, Velasco sang &quot;Ex Factor&quot;. She also sang solo during group covers of &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, &quot;Heartburn&quot;, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;. Velasco later reflected that the tour was an amazing experience, and it had raised her confidence immensely.

After &quot;American Idol&quot;, Velasco went to the Philippines to perform at a Christmas concert with Martin Nievera. She performed with South Border, Billy Crawford, and several others. When she returned to the US, Velasco settled in Los Angeles, California, and began to work in the studio, and study music and writing at the Musician&#x27;s Institute in Hollywood.

=== Solo career ===
In 2005, Velasco headlined a variety of gigs after signing with Universal/Motown Records. In the first half of the year, she performed at the Pro Bowl Concert in Hawaii; the Yeah Baby! Expo in Anaheim; a two-day concert for the 50th State Fair in Oahu; and in Phoenix and San Diego, where she sang the national anthem. Velasco also made appearances on American Idol and at the Gen Ex LA Fashion Week. When her first single, &quot;Hangin’ On,&quot; was released, her demand increased, especially in the Filipino-American music scene. This led to several headlining concerts, including the two-day Fil-Am Unity Jam (A Night with Camile Velasco) 3-Style Attractions, Jam Sessions, and Lumpiapalooza 2 in California, as well as a concert with Gary Valenciano and IBU in Chicago. One of Velasco&#x27;s more notable television appearances was a live performance on the TFC series World Musikahan with host, Ryan Cayabyab, which aired in October. In 2005, she also got her first spot on a magazine cover for the Arizona Republic&#x27;s Yes magazine.

In 2006, Velasco parted with Motown Records, but continued to perform around the US. In January, she made a rare East Coast appearance in New York, and made an announcement at a press conference that she would be joining the Filipino band, Aegis, for a US tour. Throughout the year, Velasco made appearances on American Idol and the Idol Tonight segment. She also performed enthusiastically in Hawaii, almost once a month. On her MySpace page, Velasco chose to release a new song-in-the-making, entitled &quot;Da Da Da,&quot; that was met with a positive response from fans. In July, she took part in the filming of The Black Eyed Peas’ &quot;Bebot&quot; video. Also, in September alone, Velasco performed at a two-day concert and birthday celebration for her and her manager, she was a featured act at the Festival of Philippine Arts and Culture in San Pedro, California, she was interviewed on LA TV, and she performed with fellow Idol alumnus, Jasmine Trias, in Maui. Before the close of 2006, she performed with IBU in Las Vegas, and briefly returned to the Philippines for a concert with apl.de.ap.

In the first week of February 2007, Velasco had the honor of opening for her idol, Lauryn Hill, at the Bob Marley Fest in Kapolei, HI.

Velasco took an extended break from performing in June 2007 after the Fiesta Filipinas in Oxnard, California, to further concentrate on songwriting and finishing her debut album.

As of April 2008, Velasco premiered a weekly show on YouTube titled CamileTV, with a new episode every Friday. Shows are usually 2 to 3 minutes and include personal moments, performing live, playing instruments, and singing covers of pop, rock, jazz, and soul songs. Once CamileTV was launched, she began to perform once again. Her most notable appearance was at the APIA Vote seminar in May 2008 featuring Asian American Rapper KeyKool of the Visionaries.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, she appeared on American Idol Rewind, which re-runs episodes from the third season of the television series with recent interviews of past contestants.

Her single &quot;Guava Jelly&quot; was produced by Stephen Marley and released onto iTunes in October 14, 2008. It received the Hawaii Music Awards&#x27; Single of the Year in April 2009. It was to be her first single off her debut album titled &quot;Koy&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be released in 2009 but has yet to be released. Her next single &quot;Super Star&quot; was released in Japan in 2010.

In 2013, she appeared on the track &quot;All My Time&quot; on Cheesa&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Naked&quot;. In 2014, she officially announced that she will be performing professionally under the stage name, Eli-Mac. 
In October 2014, she released her Dubstop EP.

<text>Katherine Matilda Swinton (born 5 November 1960) is a British actress. She is known for playing eccentric and enigmatic characters, often working with auteurs. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and nominations for four Golden Globe Awards. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her as one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

Swinton began her career by appearing in Derek Jarman&#x27;s experimental films &quot;Caravaggio&quot; (1986), &quot;The Last of England&quot; (1988), &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Garden&quot; (1990). Swinton won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress for her portrayal of Isabella of France in &quot;Edward II&quot; (1991). She next starred in Sally Potter&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; (1992) and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance in &quot;The Deep End&quot; (2001), followed by appearances in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001), &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), and &quot;Young Adam&quot; (2003).

Swinton won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a general counsel in the legal thriller &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; (2007). Other credits include &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), &quot;Burn After Reading&quot; (2008), &quot;I Am Love&quot; (2009), &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot; (2011), &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; (2013), &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; (2014), &quot;Suspiria&quot; (2018), &quot;Memoria&quot; (2021), &quot;The Eternal Daughter&quot; (2022), and &quot;The Room Next Door&quot; (2024). Swinton has also gained popular recognition for playing the White Witch in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series (2005–2010) and the Ancient One in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. She is also known for her roles in the Wes Anderson films &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012), &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018), &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021), and &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023).

Throughout her career Swinton has received various honors including a special tribute by the Museum of Modern Art in 2013, the British Film Institute Fellowship and the Honorary Golden Lion in 2020 as well as the Honorary Golden Bear in 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Katherine Matilda Swinton was born on 5 November 1960 in London, the daughter of Judith Balfour (née Killen; 1929–2012) and Sir John Swinton (1925–2018), the Laird of Kimmerghame House. She has three brothers. Her father was a retired major-general in the British Army, and was Lord Lieutenant of Berwickshire from 1989 to 2000. Her mother was Australian. Her paternal great-grandfather was a Scottish politician and herald, George Swinton, and her maternal great-great-grandfather was the Scottish botanist John Hutton Balfour. The Swintons are an ancient Scots family whose members can trace their lineage to the 9th Century. Swinton considers herself &quot;first and foremost&quot; a Scot.

Swinton attended three independent schools: Queen&#x27;s Gate School in London, the West Heath Girls&#x27; School, and also Fettes College for a brief period. West Heath was a boarding school, where she was a classmate and friend of Lady Diana Spencer, the future Princess of Wales. As an adult, Swinton has spoken out against boarding schools, stating that West Heath was &quot;a very lonely and isolating environment&quot; and that she thinks boarding schools &quot;are a very cruel setting in which to grow up and I don&#x27;t feel children benefit from that type of education. Children need their parents and the love parents can provide.&quot; Swinton spent two years as a volunteer in South Africa and Kenya before university.

In 1983, Swinton graduated from New Hall at the University of Cambridge with a degree in social and political sciences. While at Cambridge, she joined the Communist Party; she later joined the Scottish Socialist Party. It was in college that Swinton began performing on stage.

==Career==
=== 1984–2004: Rise to prominence ===
Swinton joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984, appearing in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. She also worked with the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, starring in &quot;Mann ist Mann&quot; by Manfred Karge in 1987. On television, she appeared as Julia in the 1986 mini-series &quot;Zastrozzi: A Romance&quot; based on the Gothic novel by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her first film was &quot;Caravaggio&quot; in 1986, directed by Derek Jarman. In 1987, Swinton starred along Bill Paterson in Peter Wollen&#x27;s &quot;Friendship&#x27;s Death&quot;, she played a female extraterrestrial robot on a peace mission to Earth. In 1988, Swinton was a member of the jury at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival.

Swinton went on to star in several Jarman films, including &quot;The Last of England&quot; (1987), &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1989) opposite Laurence Olivier, and &quot;Edward II&quot; (1991), for which she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 1991 Venice Film Festival. She performed in the performance art piece &quot;Volcano Saga&quot; by Joan Jonas in 1989. The 28-minute video art piece is based on a 13th-century Icelandic Laxdæla Saga, and it tells a mythological story of a young woman whose dreams tell of the future.

Swinton played the title role in &quot;Orlando&quot; (1992), Sally Potter&#x27;s film version of the novel by Virginia Woolf. The part allowed Swinton to explore matters of gender presentation onscreen, which reflected her lifelong interest in androgynous style. Swinton later reflected on the role in an interview accompanied by a striking photo shoot. &quot;People talk about androgyny in all sorts of dull ways,&quot; said Swinton, noting that the recent rerelease of &quot;Orlando&quot; had her thinking again about its pliancy. She referred to 1920s playful, androgynous French artist Claude Cahun: &quot;Cahun looked at the limitlessness of an androgynous gesture, which I&#x27;ve always been interested in.&quot;

In 1993, she was a member of the jury at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1995, with producer Joanna Scanlan, Swinton developed a performance/installation live art piece in the Serpentine Gallery, London, where she was on display to the public for a week, asleep or apparently so, in a glass case, as a piece of performance art. The piece is sometimes incorrectly credited to Cornelia Parker, whom Swinton invited to collaborate for the installation in London. The performance, titled &quot;The Maybe&quot;, was repeated in 1996 at the Museo Barracco in Rome and in 2013 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1996, she appeared in the music video for Orbital&#x27;s &quot;The Box&quot;.

Recent years have seen Swinton move toward mainstream projects, including the leading role in the American film &quot;The Deep End&quot; (2001), in which she played the mother of a gay son she suspects of killing his boyfriend. For this performance, she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. She appeared as a supporting character in the films &quot;The Beach&quot; (2000), featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001), and as the archangel Gabriel in &quot;Constantine&quot;. Swinton appeared in the British films &quot;The Statement&quot; (2003) and &quot;Young Adam&quot; (2003). For her performance in the latter film, she received the British Academy Scotland Award for Best Actress.

=== 2005–2015: Career breakthrough ===
Swinton has collaborated with the fashion designers Viktor &amp; Rolf; she was the focus of their &quot;One Woman Show&quot; 2003, in which they made all the models look like copies of Swinton, and she read a poem (of her own) that included the line &quot;There is only one you. Only one&quot;. In 2005, Swinton performed as the White Witch Jadis, in the film version of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and as Audrey Cobb in the Mike Mills film adaptation of the novel &quot;Thumbsucker&quot;. Swinton later had cameos in &quot;Narnia&quot;″s sequels &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. In August 2006, she opened the new Screen Academy Scotland production centre in Edinburgh. In 2007, Swinton&#x27;s performance as Karen Crowder in &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; earned her both a British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as well as the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 2008 80th Academy Awards, the film&#x27;s sole win from the latter association.

In July 2008, Swinton founded the film festival Ballerina Ballroom Cinema of Dreams. The event took place in a ballroom in Nairn on Scotland&#x27;s Moray Firth in August. Swinton next appeared in the 2008 Coen Brothers film &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;. She was cast in the role of Elizabeth Abbott in &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot;, alongside Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt. She collaborated with artist Patrick Wolf on his 2009 album &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, contributing four spoken word pieces. Also in 2009, she and Mark Cousins embarked on a project where they mounted a 33.5-tonne portable cinema on a large truck, hauling it manually through the Scottish Highlands, creating a travelling independent film festival. The project was featured prominently in a documentary titled &quot;Cinema Is Everywhere&quot;. The festival was repeated in 2011.

She had a starring role as the eponymous character in Erick Zonca&#x27;s &quot;Julia&quot;, which premiered at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival and saw a U.S. release in May 2009. She starred in the film adaptation of the novel &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;, released in October 2011. She portrayed the mother of the title character, a teenage boy who commits a high school massacre. In 2012, she was cast in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2013, and was released in the U.S. in the first half of 2014. She played Mason in the 2014 sci-fi film &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;. Also in 2012, Swinton appeared in Doug Aitken&#x27;s &quot;SONG 1&quot;, an outdoor video installation created for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. In November of the same year, she and Sandro Kopp made cameo appearances in episode 6 of the BBC comedy &quot;Getting On&quot;.

She co-founded Drumduan Upper School in Findhorn, Scotland in 2013 with Ian Sutherland McCook. Swinton and McCook both had children who attended the Moray Steiner School, whose students graduate at age 14. They founded Drumduan partly to allow their children to continue their Steiner educations with neither grading nor tests. Swinton resigned as a director of Drumduan in April 2019.

In February 2013, she played the part of David Bowie&#x27;s wife in the promotional video for his song &quot;The Stars (Are Out Tonight)&quot;, directed by Floria Sigismondi. In 2013, she was named as one of the 50 best-dressed over 50 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 2015, she starred in Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s thriller &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot;, opposite Dakota Johnson, Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes. Also in 2015, she played Dianne, Amy Schumer&#x27;s character&#x27;s editor on S&#x27;Nuff Magazine, in &quot;Trainwreck&quot;.

=== 2016–present ===
Swinton portrayed the Ancient One in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in the 2016 film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and the 2019 film &quot;&quot;. Swinton starred in Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s 2018 remake of the horror film &quot;Suspiria&quot;. She played several roles, and was credited as Lutz Ebersdorf. She was ranked one of the best dressed women in 2018 by fashion website Net-a-Porter. In 2021, Swinton starred as newspaper writer J.K.L. Berensen in the Wes Anderson anthology film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;, and as Jessica Holland in Apichatpong Weerasethakul&#x27;s first English-language film, &quot;Memoria&quot;. In 2022 she starred in George Miller&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Three Thousand Years of Longing&quot; and voiced Wood Sprite and Death in the animated film &quot;Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s Pinocchio&quot;. Also that year she played dual roles of mother and daughter in Joanna Hogg&#x27;s gothic drama &quot;The Eternal Daughter&quot; (2022). Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised Swinton&#x27;s performance describing the acting feat as a &quot;tour de force&quot;. The following year she reunited with Wes Anderson for the film &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023). Swinton starred in Julio Torres&#x27;s surrealist A24 comedy &quot;Problemista&quot; and David Fincher&#x27;s action thriller &quot;The Killer&quot; both released in 2023. 

In 2024 Swinton had a cameo in the Amazon Prime series &quot;The Boys&quot;, in which she voiced Ambrosius, the Deep&#x27;s octopus lover.

Although born in London and having attended various schools in England, Swinton describes her nationality as Scottish, citing her childhood, growing up in Scotland and Scottish aristocratic family background. In 1997, Swinton gave birth to twins, Honor and Xavier Swinton Byrne, with John Byrne, a Scottish artist and playwright. She moved to Scotland in 1997, and as of 2023 she lives in Nairn, overlooking the Moray Firth in the Highland region of Scotland, with her children and partner Sandro Kopp, a German painter, with whom she has been in a relationship since 2004. In 2018, Swinton stated her support for Scottish independence. In October 2023, she criticized Israel&#x27;s military offensive in the Gaza Strip and called for a ceasefire. On February 2025, while giving a speech at the Berlin film festival, Swinton called out “the astonishing savagery of spite, state-perpetrated and internationally enabled mass murder” as a response to Trump&#x27;s plan to take over Gaza. 

Swinton signed a 2009 petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival because of sexual abuse charges filed against him in a 1977 incident. The petition argued that his detention undermined the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot; and that the arrest of filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects&quot;. 

In a 2021 interview with &quot;Vogue&quot;, Swinton mentioned that she identifies as queer. She was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m very clear that queer is actually, for me anyway, to do with sensibility. I always felt I was queer – I was just looking for my queer circus, and I found it. And having found it, it&#x27;s my world.&quot; She said that her collaborations with several creative visionaries helped her to find a sense of familiar belonging. In a 2022 profile by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she stated, &quot;It just so happened I&#x27;d also been a queer kid – not in terms of my sexual life, just odd.&quot;

In January 2022, Swinton revealed she is recovering from long COVID, with symptoms including having trouble getting out of bed, a bad cough, vertigo, and memory loss. She also stated that she was considering quitting acting to &quot;retrain as a palliative carer&quot;, informed both by the trauma of living through the AIDS epidemic in the UK (feeling a similarity between her experiences and those of the characters in Russell T Davies&#x27;s 2021 TV drama miniseries &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;) and &quot;witnessing the loving support her parents received from professional carers at the end of their lives, and the impact it had on her.&quot;

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Swinton has amassed a prolific list of credits, including over sixty film roles and a dozen television appearances. Swinton has also received several accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the British Academy Scotland Award for Best Actress, the British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, in addition to nominations for five Critics&#x27; Choice Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. 

In 2020, Swinton was awarded the British Film Institute Fellowship for her &quot;daringly eclectic and striking talents as a performer and filmmaker and recognises her great contribution to film culture, independent film exhibition and philanthropy.&quot; Also in 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked her thirteenth on its list of &quot;The Greatest Actors of the 21st Century&quot;. In November 2022, she was presented with the 2022 FIAF Award &quot;for her work on the preservation and promotion of archive film, film history and women&#x27;s role in it&quot;. She was awarded the Richard Harris Award by the British Independent Film Awards in recognition of her contributions to the British film industry. In 2006, Swinton was awarded an honorary degree by the Edinburgh Napier University for her services to performing arts.

<text>The Otago Peninsula () is a long, hilly indented finger of land that forms the easternmost part of Dunedin, New Zealand. Volcanic in origin, it forms one wall of the eroded valley that now forms Otago Harbour. The peninsula lies south-east of Otago Harbour and runs parallel to the mainland for 20 km, with a maximum width of 9 km. It is joined to the mainland at the south-west end by a narrow isthmus about 1.5 km wide.

The suburbs of Dunedin encroach onto the western end of the peninsula, and seven townships and communities lie along the harbourside shore. The majority of the land is sparsely populated and occupied by steep open pasture. The peninsula is home to many species of wildlife, notably seabirds, pinnipeds, and penguins; several ecotourism businesses operate in the area.

==Geography==
The peninsula was formed at the same time as the hills facing it across the harbour, as part of the large, long-extinct, Dunedin Volcano. Several of the peninsula&#x27;s peaks, notably the aptly named Harbour Cone, demonstrate these volcanic origins. These rocks were built up between 13 and 10 million years ago.

Much of the peninsula is steep hill country, with the highest points being Mount Charles (408m), Highcliff (381m), and Sandymount (320m). Two tidal inlets lie on the Pacific coast of the peninsula, Hoopers Inlet and Papanui Inlet. Between them is the headland of Cape Saunders. Nearby natural features include the 250m-high cliffs of Lovers&#x27; Leap and The Chasm.

At the entrance to the Otago Harbour the peninsula rises to Taiaroa Head, home to a breeding colony of northern royal albatross, the only colony of albatross to be found on an inhabited mainland. The viewing centre for the albatross colony is one of the peninsula&#x27;s main ecotourism attractions, along with other wildlife such as seals and yellow-eyed penguins. Most of the Otago Peninsula is freehold farming land, with increasing numbers of small holdings or lifestyle blocks. Some biodiversity sites such as Taiaroa Head are managed as sanctuaries for wildlife. Many species of seabirds and waders in particular may be found around the tidal inlets, including spoonbills, plovers, and herons.

The Pacific coast of the peninsula includes several beaches that are far away enough from Dunedin to be sparsely populated even in mid-summer. These include Allans Beach, Boulder Beach, Victory Beach, and Sandfly Bay.

Victory Beach, named after the 19th century shipwreck of the &quot;Victory&quot; close by, features a rock formation known locally as &quot;The Pyramids&quot; for its resemblance to the ancient Egyptian monuments. Sandfly Bay, named not for the insect but for the sand blown up by the wind, is reached via a path through some of New Zealand&#x27;s tallest sand dunes, which rise for some 100 metres above the beach.

Other tourist attractions on the peninsula include Larnach Castle, a restored Armstrong &#x27;disappearing&#x27; gun coastal defence post, and a war memorial cairn. There are views of the city and surrounding country from Highcliff Road, which runs along the spine of the peninsula.

The total population of the peninsula is under 10,000, with about half of these in the suburbs of Dunedin that encroach onto its western end, such as Vauxhall and Shiel Hill. Mostly, only the side adjacent to the Otago Harbour is populated, with several small communities dotting the length of the peninsula. Largest of these are Macandrew Bay (the peninsula&#x27;s largest settlement, population 1,100), Portobello, and Otakou. Otakou was the site of the first permanent European settlement on the harbour, and of an early whaling station, commemorated at nearby Weller&#x27;s Rock. There were several other whaling stations inside the harbour and outer peninsula, including the Middle Fishery Station at Harington Point.


==History==
===Pre-European settlement===
New Zealand was first settled by humans around 1300 AD, and in the South Island, people concentrated on the east coast. In the Archaic (moa-hunting) period, the Otago Peninsula was a relatively densely occupied area at the centre of the country&#x27;s most populous region.

A map of recorded Māori archaeological sites for the Otago Conservancy shows many more on the Otago Peninsula than elsewhere in the region. Another showing only those of the Archaic period shows sites clustered on the peninsula and along the coast across the harbour to the west and north. This was one of three clusters on the South Island&#x27;s south east coast: one from about Oamaru south to Pleasant River; another from Waikouaiti south, including the Otago Peninsula and tailing off near the Kaikorai estuary; another extending south from the Matau river mouth. The clusters contain a few larger sites. On the Otago Peninsula that at Little Papanui is of middle size while Harwood Township has one of the largest. These and numerous other smaller sites are clearly visible, though often not recognised by visitors for what they are.

Their occupants were Polynesians ancestral to modern Māori, who lived by hunting large birds, notably the now extinct flightless moa, but also seals and by fishing.

Whale ivory chevron pendants found at Little Papanui were made by the site&#x27;s early occupants and are now in the Otago Museum, Dunedin. The site&#x27;s lowest levels are estimated to have been occupied some time between 1150 and 1300 AD. Another peninsula site, at Papanui Inlet, is thought to have been occupied in the same period, as was the extensive one at Harwood Township. Little Papanui and Harwood are considered to have been permanent settlements, not temporary camps. A single radiocarbon date for Harwood suggests it was also occupied in 1450. Three magnificent pounamu adzes, said by H.D. Skinner to be the finest of their type, were found nearby and are dated to the same time. They represent a form already archaic when they were made. They are currently in the Otago Museum.

Southern Māori oral tradition tells of five successively arriving peoples and while the earliest, Kahui Tipua, appear to be fairy folk, modern anthropological opinion is that they represent historical people who have become encrusted with legend. Te Rapuwai were next and seemed to be succeeded by two Waitaha tribes, but it has been suggested this was really one with &#x27;Waitaha&#x27; also being used as a catchall name for all earlier peoples by some later arrivals. &quot;Te Rapuwai&quot; may perhaps also have been used like this. Nevertheless, some middens, such as those on the peninsula, have been identified traditionally with Te Rapuwai. Anderson&#x27;s later, or tribal Waitaha, arrived in the south in the 15th century.

Moa and moa hunters went into decline but a new Classic Māori culture evolved, characterised by the construction of pā, and new peoples arrived on the Otago Peninsula. People here at this time practised what has been called a foraging economy. Increasing reliance was placed on harvesting the root of the cabbage tree/tī kouka, and &#x27;umu ti&#x27;, cabbage tree ovens, proliferate over some parts of the Peninsula, showing intensive use of the land.

Kāti Mamoe (Ngāti Mamoe) arrived in the late 16th century. Kai Tahu came about a hundred years later. Pukekura, a fortress on Taiaroa Head, was built about 1650. Nearby villages on Te Rauone Beach perhaps date from the same time. Pukekura&#x27;s terraces are still visible, with some of them co-opted into later European defence works.

Many traditions survive from this period concerning figures such as Waitai and Moki II who at different times both lived at Pukekura pā. One of the best known concerns Tarewai, who is difficult to place chronologically, but was of Kai Tāhu descent. He gained possession of Pukekura, was in conflict with Kāti Māmoe at Papanui Inlet and made a famous escape back into Pukekura by a cliff still known as Tarewai&#x27;s Leap. There had been an argument about Kāti Māmoe fishing rights on Papanui Inlet. A particularly fine talismanic whale bone fishook of the 18th century was found there and is now in the Otago Museum.

===Arrival of the Europeans===
James Cook sailed past in February 1770 and named Cape Saunders after the Secretary of the Admiralty. 
His chart showed a bay at Hooper&#x27;s Inlet, which may have been explored and named by Charles Hooper (chief officer on Daniel Cooper&#x27;s English sealer, &quot;Unity&quot;) in the summer of 1808–1809. 
Sealers began to use the harbour around then, probably anchoring off Wellers&#x27; Rock, modern Otakou, where there was extensive Māori settlement. 
Otago Harbour is where the Sealers&#x27; War began, sparked by an incident on the &quot;Sydney Cove&quot; while her men were sealing at Cape Saunders. This led to James Kelly&#x27;s 1817 attack on &#x27;the City of Otago&#x27; (probably the Te Rauone settlement(s)), after William Tucker and others were killed at Whareakeake (Murdering Beach) further north. Peace was re-established by 1823. 
1826 saw the visit of the &quot;Rosanna&quot; and the &quot;Lambton&quot;, ships of the first New Zealand Company. They also brought the first recorded European women to NZ, and produced Thomas Shepherd&#x27;s pictures of the Peninsula. Shepherd&#x27;s paintings are the oldest known, and are held in the Sydney&#x27;s Mitchell Library. In November 1831 the Weller brothers, Joseph, George and Edward, established their whaling station at Wellers&#x27; Rock. Throughout the &#x27;30s, their Otago establishment grew to be the largest in the country and the harbour became an international whaling port. In 1841 Octavius Harwood and C.W. Schultze took over the Wellers&#x27; operation.
There was conflict with Māori, who suffered epidemics of measles and influenza in 1835 and 1836. Whaling collapsed in 1839 and in March 1840 Dumont D&#x27;Urville, a visiting French navigator, described the Peninsula&#x27;s European and Māori communities as both trafficking in alcohol and sex. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on the Peninsula in June, although the South Island had already been annexed by &#x27;right of discovery&#x27;. The first Christian service was preached on the Peninsula later that year at Otago by Bishop Pompallier.

Various European visitors in the 1840s made records.

In 1844 the Otago Association negotiated with local Kai Tahu to purchase the Otago Block for its Scottish Free Church settlement. However, at the initial meeting between iwi and agent (the New Zealand Company) the Kai Tahu leaders on 18 June stated their wish to retain the entire peninsula for themselves. But the company&#x27;s surveyor Frederick Tuckett was reluctant to allow the Kai Tahu to retain military strategic land so close to the proposed site of the new settlement, nor allow them to control land on which there were already European settlers, in case they developed a settlement that would compete with that of the Otago Association&#x27;s. The Kai Tahu negotiators convinced Turkett that while they would give up some of the peninsula they would not sell the northern portion, as this was where their villages and urupā were. Some chiefs with strong Mamoe connections wanted to retain all of the Peninsula from Puketai onwards (as Anderson&#x27;s Bay was then called). When William Wakefield of the New Zealand Company arrived on site on 16 July he was reluctant to accept this. Eventually, to purchase any of the land Wakefield had to accept the Kai Tahu position. The deed of sale was signed on 31 July 1844 with Kai Tahu retaining 6,665 acres (2,697 ha) of the northern part of the peninsula.

Charles Kettle, the association&#x27;s surveyor, laid out suburban and country blocks in 1846 and 1847. The arrival of the first migrant ships in early 1848 saw the focus of settlement move to Dunedin while Port Chalmers on the other side of the harbour succeeded Otago as the international port. In December William Cargill, secular leader of the Otago settlement, successfully petitioned the government to re-instate &#x27;Otago&#x27; as its original name. The old whaling village and adjacent Māori settlements had now become &#x27;Otakou&#x27;.

===Growth of modern settlement===

As Dunedin developed the Peninsula&#x27;s southern end became a city recreation ground and then a suburb.
As increasing numbers of immigrants began arriving settlements were formed on the harbourside and on the Highcliff Road on the spine of the land mass, but in the early phase of European settlement, also on the more exposed Pacific slopes.

The discovery of gold in 1861 resulted int a massive inrush of people and capital into Otago. Over the next decade millions of pounds worth of gold flowed from the diggings, the majority passing through Dunedin. The rapid growth of Dunedin into the most prosperous city in New Zealand stimulated development on the peninsula as farmers received higher prices for many of the goods that they supplied the city. By 1864 the population of the peninsula had grown to 1,269 and to 2,425 by 1881. The Maori population living on the peninsula however had decreased from a minimum of 500 to 600 in the early 1830s and to 22 in 1891. As a result of increased settlement native bush was cleared over most of the terrain in a massive transformation of the landscape.

The increased wealth also lead in the 1860s to pleasure gardens being established at Vauxhall; George Grey Russell built his house at Glenfalloch and William Larnach acquired the land for his big house at Pukehiki, &#x27;Larnach Castle&#x27;.

A lighthouse was built at Taiaroa Head in 1864 and work began using prison labour, to build the winding harbourside road, with its distinctive seawalls of the local stone. Across the cleared land settlers built dry stone walls, following the pattern of &#x27;Galloway Dykes&#x27;, another conspicuous and distinctive feature of the landscape whose only other examples in New Zealand are across the harbour on the opposite heights. Stone lime kilns were built near Sandymount in 1864.

By the end of the 1860s most farms were less than 100 acres (40 ha) in size, with a total of 6,000 acres (2,428 ha) fenced off and growing either crops or livestock. By 1880 about a third of the land area of the peninsula was being farmed (moistly in the form of dairying), with the rest still in bush, swamp or sand.
From the times of the earliest European settlements with the harbour surrounded by bush covered hills and no roads existing other than simple bridal tracks using the waters of the harbour offered the most efficient means of transporting passengers and goods between settlements.
As settlements developed jetties were constructed at Andersons Bay, Vauxhall, Waverly, Burns Point, Johnstons, Glenfallach, Macandrew Bay, Company Bay, Broad Bay, Ross Point, Portobello, Otakou and Harington Point.
In 1862 a jetty was constructed at Andersons Bay to service Vauxhall Gardens, a large entertainment venue with gardens, baths, hotel, sports grounds, swings and roundabouts and a band rotunda. The jetty was used by a number of ferries including the &quot;Nugget&quot;, &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; (in 1864 and 1865), &quot;Golden Age&quot; (over the summer) &quot;Minerva&quot; (briefly in 1864) and the &quot;Iron Age&quot; to being customers to the venue until following the end of the gold rush the venture became uneconomic and eventually closed. 
Roads boards were responsible for the construction of new roads and their maintenance. A road to Andersons Bay and Tomahawk was completed by the winter of 1860, and from there to Highcliff and Portobello was by bridle track which was not suitable for wheeled transport, which lead to most settlements being restricted to Andersons Bay, Tomahawk, Portobello and smaller settlements along the coast where they could be serviced by ferries. Ferry services first began in 1859.

A railway was completed to Andersons Bay in 1878 but it never proceeded any further. A causeway was completed across Andersons Bay to Vauxhall Corner in 1872. It featured a bridge which could be opened to allow passage for boats.

Following the abolishing of the provincial council in 1876, governance of the peninsula became the responsibility of the Peninsula County Council, whose administrative centre was in Portobello.

By 1878 the bay road had reached Portobello which allowed a mail coach and later horse-drawn buses to operate along it while many residents made their way independently by their own private horses and carts. The resulting drop in patronage lead to many ferry services being withdrawn. The improved land connection encouraged the development of settlements at East Harbour (subsequently renamed Macandrew Bay), Company Bay and Broad Bay.

In the 1880s, following fears of a Russian invasion, Taiaroa Head was extensively fortified. An Armstrong Disappearing gun was installed in 1886. Ferries linked the peninsula&#x27;s harbour coast with the city and Port Chalmers.

Despite the erosion-prone clay soils and steep slopes by 1900 90% of the approximately 200 farmers on the peninsula were engaged in dairying. This led to New Zealand&#x27;s first dairy co-operative, being established at Springfield on the Highcliff Road in 1871. Once the Taieri and Peninsula Milk Supply Company was established in 1884 most dairy farmers became members through for a brief period in the late 1880s milk was shipped across the harbour from Portobello for processing at Sawyers Bay at by Roseville Dairy Company. Between 1891 and 1896 farmers also had the option of supplying the New Zealand Dairy Supply Company which also operated in the area. The Taieri and Peninsula Milk Supply Company opened a creamery at Sandymount in 1893 and by 1897 there were additional ones at Granton, Papanui Inlet and Otakou. Another opened at Highcliff in 1903. The resulting product was shipped to Dunedin, where it was made into butter. By this time the peninsula was also supplying the majority of Dunedin&#x27;s potatoes with approximately 70 farmers around Highcliff and Sandymount engaged in their production. In addition there were a number of Chinese dominated market gardens at Andersons Bay and a smaller number at Portobello (from 1881 onwards) growing a wide range of produce.
The first telephone was installed in Andersons Bay in 1885.

Land clearance continued at pace and by 1915 only 938 acres (379 ha) of bush remained.
In 1888 a universally unpopular toll on the low road to Portobello was introduced by the Portobello Road Board to offset its maintenance and development costs. the toll gate was located near Macandrew Bay.
During the 1890s the Portobello Road became popular with cyclists who lobbied the Road Board to reduce the toll. Cyclists were being charged 5 shillings for the round trip, which had been reduced by 1896 to sixpence on Sundays and reduced further to 1903 to sixpence return and then to threepence in 1904. In 1908 the toll was removed. In 1907 the first automobile was sighted on the road but a bylaw was introduced to ban them until a local referendum was held in 1913 overturned it. These actions improved accessibility and reduced the cost of accessing the peninsula, which impacted on the ferries.

By 1900 of the peninsula&#x27;s 24,016 acres (9,718 ha) only approximately 4,000 acres (of which 3,000 was still in bush) had not been occupied by farming activities or urban construction. By that same year Andersons Bay was becoming a popular place to live, especially with businessman and professionals, a number of them constructing large homes.

In 1904 a marine fish hatchery was established at Aquarium Point, Portobello. Another sign of changing attitudes to wild life was the self-establishment of the royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in the 1920s which was now carefully nurtured for its scientific interest.

Radio masts appeared at Highcliff and rural depopulation was compensated by the growth of the harbourside settlements. Improving roads saw the demise of the ferries.

After World War 2 the Taiaroa Head garrison was withdrawn and the lighthouse automated. The University of Otago took over the hatchery as a research facility as its commercial purpose waned.

The 20th century saw land use change as the draining and development of the Taieri Plain eventually led to that area eclipsing the Peninsula&#x27;s dairying and mixed farms gave way to extensive grazing. The rural population, especially on the Pacific coast, dwindled, leaving abandoned steadings and roads decaying slowly behind macrocarpa and hawthorn plantings. The re-made, Europeanised landscape now took on an air of mellow decay, and started to look &#x27;natural&#x27;, unusual in a recently colonised country like New Zealand. This attracted the attention of visitors and artists. Colin McCahon, New Zealand&#x27;s most celebrated painter, first worked out his &#x27;vision&#x27; of the New Zealand landscape with studies of the peninsula, the most developed being that of 1946–49 now owned by the city and on display in the central Dunedin Public Library.

The City of Dunedin absorbed Peninsula County in 1967, promising to extend water and sewerage reticulation.

In recent decades there has been growing suburban occupation of the townships, some &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; developments on the harbour slopes and an increasing tourist traffic.

The Otago Peninsula is one of the few places in New Zealand where there is everywhere visible evidence of the long human occupation of the land. In a magnificent but compact setting the challenge is to maintain its balance of human and natural in the face of growing residential and tourist development.

==Demographics==
The statistical area of Otago Peninsula covers . It includes the southern part of the peninsula east of Ocean Grove, and also Harwood, Otakou and Harington Point, but does not include the northern coast of the peninsula, which is covered at Macandrew Bay and Broad Bay.

==Natural history==
Various species of endemic, rare, and endangered wildlife have been confirmed in the vicinity of Otago Peninsula both on land and at sea. Jewelled geckos are known from the area. Giant moa were historically seen on the peninsula. Endangered ocean megafauna such as basking sharks, great white sharks, and leatherback turtles have been confirmed along Otago coasts.

===Oceanic birds===
There is a diversity of flora and fauna on the Otago Peninsula. Birds observed include the endangered yellow-eyed penguin, &quot;Megadyptes antipodes&quot;, little penguin, shags, and the northern royal albatross. The albatross&#x27; breeding colony on Taiaroa Head is the only one in the world close to large-scale human cultivation and habitation. Various species of wading birds also inhabit the peninsula, notably royal spoonbills, which are a common sight around Hooper&#x27;s Inlet and Papanui Inlet on the peninsula&#x27;s Pacific coast.

===Marine mammals===
Otago Peninsula&#x27;s coasts are prominent habitats for marine mammals. Seal and sea lion colonies have regenerated during the 20th century after massive exploitation in the 19th century, which almost wiped out both them and whales. Many New Zealand fur seals and Hooker&#x27;s sea lions currently breed around Taiaroa Head. Otago Peninsula is considered a remarkable and pioneering habitat, especially for sea lions, as it is the only continual breeding ground on a main inhabited island. Southern elephant seals and leopard seals are also known to occur in the area.

Otago Peninsula is regarded as one of the most favoured of habitats for southern right whales on mainland coasts, both currently and historically. Pre-European times, they were frequently seen in the harbour to breed or calve. They were the primary target species for shore-whaling, itself the primary reason for Port Otago. Whales were hunted almost to extinction, and now are seen rarely. Occasionally they are seen in the harbour, but an increase of shipping lanes and accompanying underwater noises may be contributing to their absence. Future studies might be conducted to examine solutions to bring them back into the harbor. Sometimes they can be seen just off the coast in their winter-migration season, along with humpback whales, which were also hunted in the area. Today, quantities of occurrence between these species have become reversed due to drastic difference in biomasses. Taiaroa Head could be the spot with highest possibilities to catch glimpses of these giants. Other baleen whales that have been recently confirmed in the area include blue whales and minke whales. One of the earliest reported specimens of Antarctic minke whale was also taken in this area.

Several species of dolphins and small whales also frequent the peninsula; dusky dolphins and endangered endemic Hector&#x27;s dolphins form strong connections with the area while bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins appear less frequently. The outer peninsula just off Taiaroa Head is one of three main congregating areas for dusky dolphins in New Zealand while the harbour water and the peninsula provides breeding areas and nurseries, and Hector&#x27;s dolphins frequent the vicinity of the harbour. Orca are also occasionally seen.

Many other oceanic species such as sperm whales, long-finned pilot whales, and several species of beaked whales including Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whales, and dolphins such as southern right whale dolphins can be found further offshore around the rich, deep sea canyon about 20 km off the peninsula coast, and rarely strand. This sea canyon is the only known area in the world with multiple sightings of Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whales, and its cetacean diversity may be as significant as Kaikōura. In 2023, the sea canyon and the southern coast of the peninsula were designated as new marine reserves.

==Tourist attractions==

* Fletcher House, an Edwardian cottage museum, Broad Bay.
* Otago Peninsula Museum &amp; Historical Society Museum, Peninsula social and agricultural history, Portobello.
* Glenfalloch Woodland Gardens &amp; Cafe
* Larnach Castle
* Royal Albatross Colony - only mainland colony of albatross in the world
* In 2008 the Dunedin City Council purchased 328 hectares of land surrounding Harbour Cone, a distinctive geological feature on the Otago Peninsula that features early-settler archaeological sites and remnants of bush from pre-colonial times. There are a number of walks to enjoy in this spectacular area, and more information can be found on the Dunedin City Council&#x27;s website: Harbour Cone
* A popular walking and cycling track (part of the Otago Harbour Cycleway) runs from the central city along the Peninsula&#x27;s harbour shore to Portobello. Google Maps does not recognise this as a walking route, but directs pedestrians from the city over to Ocean Grove, and then up Centre Road to Highcliff Road, which runs along the top of the Peninsula. In fact all roads on the Peninsula that are accessible to motorists are also accessible to cyclists and pedestrians.

<text>Chaenomeles is a genus of four species of deciduous spiny shrubs, usually 1–3 m tall, in the family Rosaceae. They are native to Southeast Asia. These plants are related to the quince (&quot;Cydonia oblonga&quot;) and the Chinese quince (&quot;Pseudocydonia sinensis&quot;), differing in the serrated leaves that lack fuzz, and in the flowers, borne in clusters, having deciduous sepals and styles that are connate at the base.

The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, and have a serrated margin. The flowers are 3–4.5 cm diameter, with five petals, and are usually bright orange-red, but can be white or pink; flowering is in late winter or early spring. The fruit is a pome with five carpels; it ripens in late autumn.

&quot;Chaenomeles&quot; is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the brown-tail and the leaf-miner &quot;Bucculatrix pomifoliella&quot;.

==Common names==
Although all quince species have flowers, gardeners in the West often refer to these species as &quot;flowering quince&quot;, since &quot;Chaenomeles&quot; are grown ornamentally for their flowers, not for their fruits. These plants have also been called &quot;Japanese quince&quot;, and the name &quot;japonica&quot; (referring to &quot;C. japonica&quot;) was widely used for these plants in the 19th and 20th centuries, although this common name is not particularly distinctive, since &quot;japonica&quot; is a specific epithet shared by many other plants. The names &quot;japonica&quot; or &quot;Japanese quince&quot; were (and still are) often loosely applied to &quot;Chaenomeles&quot; in general, regardless of their species. The most commonly cultivated &quot;Chaenomeles&quot; referred to as &quot;japonica&quot; are actually the hybrid &quot;C. × superba&quot; and &quot;C. speciosa&quot;; &quot;C. japonica&quot; itself is not as commonly grown.

==Species and hybrids==
Species accepted by the Plants of the World Online as of :
Four named hybrids have been bred in gardens. The most common is &quot;C. × superba&quot; (hybrid &quot;C. speciosa&quot; × &quot;C. japonica&quot;), while &quot;C. × vilmoriniana&quot; is a hybrid &quot;C. speciosa&quot; × &quot;C. cathayensis&quot;, and &quot;C. × clarkiana&quot; is a hybrid &quot;C. japonica&quot; × &quot;C. cathayensis&quot;. The hybrid &quot;C. × californica&quot; is a tri-species hybrid (&quot;C. × superba&quot; × &quot;C. cathayensis&quot;). Numerous named cultivars of all of these hybrids are available in the horticultural trade.

===Uses===
The species have become popular ornamental shrubs in parts of Europe and North America, grown in gardens both for their bright flowers and as a spiny barrier. Some cultivars grow up to 2 m tall, but others are much smaller and creeping. The fruits are hard and – although less astringent than quinces – are unpleasant to eat raw, tasting like an unripe apple with the acidity of a lemon, though they do soften and become less astringent after frost (via the process of bletting). The fruits are suitable for making liqueurs, as well as marmalade and preserves, as they contain more pectin than apples and true quinces. The tree is suitable for cultivation as a bonsai.

<text>This article lists the winners and nominees for the [[NAACP Image Award]] for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture. The award has also been called Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture. Out of 12 films which featured African-Americans in leading roles in 1980, Cicely Tyson was the only female in that category. She played opposite Richard Pryor in &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot;. Because of this, she and officials at the annual NAACP Image Awards program decided that she should not accept the award.

<doc id="476052" wikidata="Q329667" url="?curid=476052" title="Beloniformes">
<text>Beloniformes is an order composed of six families (and about 264 species) of freshwater and marine ray-finned fish: 
* Adrianichthyidae (ricefish and medakas) 
* Belonidae (needlefish) 
* Exocoetidae (flyingfishes) 
* Hemiramphidae (halfbeaks) 
* Scomberesocidae (sauries) 
* Zenarchopteridae (viviparous halfbeaks)

With the exception of the Adrianichthyidae, these are streamlined, medium-sized fishes that live close to the surface of the water, feeding on algae, plankton, or smaller animals including other fishes. Most are marine, though a few needlefish and halfbeaks inhabit brackish and fresh waters.

The order is sometimes divided up into two suborders, the Adrianichthyoidei and the Belonoidei, although this clade is referred to as Exocoetoidei in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. The Adrianichthyoidei contain only a single family, the Adrianichthyidae. Originally, the Adrianichthyidae were included in the Cyprinodontiformes and assumed to be closely related to the killifish, but a closer relationship to the beloniforms is indicated by various characteristics including the absence of the interhyal, resulting in the upper jaw being fixed or not protrusible. The Belonoidei may also be further subdivided into two superfamilies, the Scomberesocoidea and the Exocoetoidea. The Scomberesocoidea contain the Belonidae and Scomberesocidae, while the Exocoetoidea comprise the Exocoetidae, Hemiramphidae and Zenarchopteridae. However, newer evidence shows the flyingfishes are nested within the halfbeaks, and the needlefish and sauries are nested within the subfamily Zenarchopterinae of the family Hemiramphidae, which has been recognized as its own family. The sauries are also nested within the family Belonidae.

The beloniforms display an interesting array of jaw morphologies. The basal condition in the order excluding the ricefishes is an elongated lower jaw in juveniles and adults as represented in halfbeaks. In the needlefish and sauries, both jaws are elongated in the adults; the juveniles of most species develop through a &quot;halfbeak stage&quot; before having both jaws elongated. The elongated lower jaw is lost in adults and is lost in most juveniles in the flyingfishes and some halfbeak genera.

They are known for many commercial uses, and have about 260 different species. Beloniformes lack a complete sequence of mitogenomes. This leads to many variations in mtDNA, about 35 different ones. To understand evolution for Beloniformes and to identify the larvae, scientists will use Beloniformes to help them study this.

<doc id="476064" wikidata="Q157511" url="?curid=476064" title="Leucojum">
<text>Leucojum is a small genus of bulbous plants native to Eurasia belonging to the amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae. As currently circumscribed, the genus includes only two known species, most former species having been moved into the genus &quot;Acis&quot;. Both genera are known as snowflakes.

&quot;Leucojum&quot; is a compound of Greek λευκος, &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot; and ἰόν, &quot;ion&quot; &quot;violet&quot;. The spelling Leucoium is also used. In addition to the common name &quot;snowflakes&quot;, the two &quot;Leucojum&quot; species are also known as St. Agnes&#x27; flower, for patron saint of virgins and gardeners, and snowbells.

== Description ==

Until 2004, the genus &quot;Leucojum&quot; was treated as including species now placed in &quot;Acis&quot;. &quot;Leucojum&quot; when narrowly circumscribed consists of only two species, &quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; and &quot;Leucojum vernum&quot;. Compared to &quot;Acis&quot;, &quot;Leucojum&quot; has hollow rather than solid flower stalks (scapes), white flowers with green or yellow marks on both the inner and outer three tepals, flower stems (pedicels) at least as long as the spathes enclosing the inflorescence, and larger seeds, across. The marks at the tips of the tepals are quick way of distinguishing the genera when in flower. Like the related snowdrops (&quot;Galanthus&quot;), &quot;Leucojum&quot; has wider strap-shaped leaves rather than the usually narrowly filiform ones of &quot;Acis&quot;, wide in &quot;L. aestivum&quot; and up to wide in &quot;L. vernum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Leucojum&quot; was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, initially for two species, &quot;Leucojum vernum&quot; and &quot;L. autumnale&quot;. In 1759, he added the species &quot;L. aestivum&quot;.

In 1807, Richard Anthony Salisbury illustrated two species in &quot;The Paradisus Londinensis&quot;. He initially used the name &quot;Leucojum autumnale&quot; for the plant illustrated in plate 21, but when discussing &quot;Leucojum pulchellum&quot; (now included in &quot;L. aestivum&quot;), illustrated in plate 74, Salisbury noted the differences between the two species, and considered them sufficient to move &quot;Leucojum autumnale&quot; into a new genus, &quot;Acis&quot;. Although some botanists accepted the split between &quot;Leucojum&quot; and &quot;Acis&quot;, including Robert Sweet in 1829, most did not; for example, Brian Mathew in 1987 placed all the species in &quot;Leucojum&quot;. &quot;Acis&quot; was reinstated in 2004, after it was determined on morphological and molecular grounds that the broadly defined genus &quot;Leucojum&quot; was paraphyletic, with &quot;Acis&quot; and a more narrowly defined &quot;Leucojum&quot; being related as shown the following cladogram.

Nine former members of the genus &quot;Leucojum&quot;, characterized by their narrow leaves, solid stems and unmarked flowers, are now placed in &quot;Acis&quot;, leaving only two species in &quot;Leucojum&quot;.

===Species===
*&quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; L. – summer snowflake or Loddon lily – Europe, Middle East, Caucasus; naturalized in Japan, Australia, North America and Uruguay
*&quot;Leucojum vernum&quot; L. – spring snowflake – southern and central Europe from Spain to Ukraine; naturalised in Japan and parts of the US

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Leucojum&quot; is native to Europe, except in the north-west, and then through Turkey to Iran. The two species, but particularly &quot;L. aestivum&quot;, are widely naturalized throughout the world, including in other parts of Europe, Japan, parts of Australia, North America and Uruguay. It prefers damp situations, such as wet meadows and ditches, and shady habitats, such as woods.

==Cultivation==
The two species of &quot;Leucojum&quot; have been described as &quot;tough garden plants for damp soils&quot;. Both grow well in gardens in western Europe, with sufficient rainfall so that the soil does not dry out completely in summer. &quot;L. aestivum&quot;, the summer snowflake, grows particularly well on clay soils. &quot;L. vernum&quot;, the spring snowflake, is easy to grow in moist sunny or semi-shady places and flowers along with snowdrops. Re-planting soon after lifting is recommended. Bulbs that have dried out either fail to grow or take a long time to establish. The plant can be propagated from seed as well as by division. Seeds require a period of cold in order to germinate and take 4–5 years to reach flowering size.

Bulbs may be attacked by the narcissus bulb fly (&quot;Merodon equestris&quot;). Flowers may be eaten by slugs and snails. Infection of the leaves by the fungus &quot;Peyronellaea curtisii&quot; (syn. &quot;Stagonospora curtisii&quot;) can also kill plants.

===Cultivars===
&quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; &#x27;Gravetye Giant&#x27; is a selected cultivar with larger flowers. It is named after Gravetye Manor, an Elizabethan manor house in West Sussex, England, the home of the influential garden writer William Robinson from 1884 until his death in 1935. The house is now a hotel.

&quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; &#x27;Gravetye Giant&#x27; and &quot;L. vernum&quot; have both gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Leucojum vernum&quot; &#x27;Podpolozje&#x27; is a robust cultivar which combines the properties of var. &quot;carpathicum&quot; with that of the variant &quot;vagneri&quot;, i.e., two flowers per stem and yellowish spots on its tepals.

==Cultural importance==
&quot;Leucojum aestivum&quot; was named the county flower of Berkshire following a 2002 survey by the wild flower and plant conservation charity Plantlife. It was once common in the Loddon Valley, hence its alternative name of the &#x27;Loddon lily&#x27;.

<text>The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago is the head of the executive branch of government in Trinidad and Tobago.

Following a general election, which takes place every five years, the president appoints as prime minister the person who has the support of a majority in the House of Representatives; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the election (except in the case of the 2001 general election).

The incumbent prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago is Keith Rowley who won the 2015 general election and was sworn in on 9 September 2015 by President Anthony Carmona as the seventh prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago.

This is a list of the prime ministers of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, from the establishment of the office of Chief Minister in 1950 to the present day:

<doc id="476068" wikidata="Q1026858" url="?curid=476068" title="California State Assembly">
<text>The California State Assembly is the lower house of the California State Legislature, the upper house being the California State Senate. The Assembly convenes, along with the State Senate, at the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

Neither house has been expanded since the ratification of the 1879 Constitution, and each of the 80 members represent at least 465,000 people, more than any other state lower house, and second largest of any lower house in the United States after the federal House of Representatives.

Members of the California State Assembly are generally referred to using the titles Assemblyman, Assemblywoman, or Assemblymember. In the current legislative session, Democrats have a three-fourths supermajority of 60 seats, while Republicans control a minority of 19 seats.

== Leadership ==
The speaker presides over the State Assembly in the chief leadership position, controlling the flow of legislation and committee assignments. The speaker is nominated by the caucus of the majority party and elected by the full Assembly. Other leaders, such as the majority and minority leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses according to each party&#x27;s strength in the chamber.

The current speaker is Democrat Robert Rivas (29th–Hollister). The majority leader is Democrat Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (4th–Winters), while the minority leader is Republican James Gallagher (3rd–Yuba City).

== Terms of office ==

Members are allowed, by current term limits, to serve 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four-year State Senate or two-year State Assembly terms. However, members elected to the Legislature prior to 2012 are restricted to three two-year terms (six years). Few, if any, legislators remain from this era, though the restriction could affect future candidates running after a hiatus from office. 

Every two years, all 80 seats in the Assembly are subject to election. This is in contrast to the State Senate, in which only half of its 40 seats are subject to election every two years.

== Meeting chamber ==
The chamber&#x27;s green tones are based on the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The dais rests along a wall shaped like an &quot;E&quot;, with its central projection housing the rostrum. Along the cornice appears a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and a Latin quotation: &quot;legislatorum est justas leges condere&quot; (&quot;It is the duty of legislators to pass just laws&quot;). Almost every decorating element is identical to the Senate Chamber.

== Candidate qualifications ==
To run for the Assembly, a candidate must be a United States citizen and a registered voter in the district at the time nomination papers are issued, and meet the criteria of the term limits described above. According to Article 4, Section 2(c) of the California Constitution, the candidate must have one year of residency in the legislative district and California residency for three years.

== Employees ==
The chief clerk of the Assembly, a position that has existed since the Assembly&#x27;s creation, is responsible for many administrative duties. The chief clerk is the custodian of all Assembly bills and records and publishes the &quot;Assembly Daily Journal&quot;, the minutes of floor sessions, as well as the &quot;Assembly Daily File&quot;, the Assembly agenda. The chief clerk is the Assembly&#x27;s parliamentarian, and in this capacity gives advice to the presiding officer on matters of parliamentary procedure. The chief clerk is also responsible for engrossing and enrolling of measures, and the transmission of legislation to the governor.

The Assembly also employs the position of chaplain, a position that has existed in both houses since the first legislative session back in 1850. Currently, the chaplain of the Assembly is Imam Mohammad Yasir Khan, the first chaplain historically that practices Islam.

The position of sergeant-at-arms of the Assembly has existed since 1849; Samuel N. Houston was the first to hold this post, overseeing one deputy. The sergeant-at-arms is mostly tasked with law enforcement duties, but customarily also has a ceremonial and protocol role. Today, some fifty employees are part of the Assembly Sergeant-at-Arms Office.

<text>The California State Senate is the upper house of the California State Legislature, the lower house being the California State Assembly. The state senate convenes, along with the state assembly, at the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

Neither house has expanded from the sizes set in the 1879 constitution, and each of the 40 state senators represents approximately 931,349 people. This is a higher number than that of any other state legislative house, than that of California&#x27;s representatives in Congress, and each state senator represents more than the population of five U.S. states (not combined).

In the current legislative session, the Democratic Party holds 30 out of the 40 seats, which constitutes a 75% majority, well over the two-thirds supermajority threshold of 27.

== History ==

The 1849 constitution of California provided that the &quot;number of Senators shall not be less than one third, nor more than one half of that of the members of the Assembly...&quot; The 1849 constitution also provided that senators served two-year terms and were to be elected bienally, with the total number of senators being divided into two classes so that one half of the senators would be elected annually.

Following the ratification of the 1879 constitution of California, the constitution prescribed that the senate is composed of 40 senators and that all senators must have resided within California for three years and their district for one year. Such districts were to be &quot;as nearly equal in population as may be, and composed of contiguous territory&quot;. There was to be one senate district for each senator. Such districts were also required to preserve political boundaries: &quot;In the formation of such districts, no county, or city and county, shall be divided, unless it contain a sufficient population within itself to form two or more districts; nor shall a part of any county, or of any city and county, be united with any other county, or city and county, in forming any district.&quot;

Between 1933 and 1967, state legislative districts were drawn according to the &quot;Little Federal Model&quot; by which Assembly seats were drawn according to population and senate seats were drawn according to county lines. The guidelines were that no senate district would include more than three counties and none would include less than one complete county. This led to the situation of a populous county such as Los Angeles County (1960 population of 6 million) being accorded the same number of state senators (one) as less populous counties such as Alpine County (1960 pop. 397). The senate districts remained unaltered from 1933 to 1967, regardless of the changes in the population distribution. In &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, the United States Supreme Court compelled all states to draw up districts with equal population. As such, boundaries were changed to comply with the ruling.

The California State Senate has never been expanded since the enactment of the 1879 constitution. In 1962, voters were asked via initiative California Proposition 23 whether to expand the state senate by 10 seats, thereby increasing the size of the body to 50 seats, and to abandon the little federal model. This proposition was rejected by the voters 46.65% - 53.35% (2,181,758 - 2,495,440).

== Leadership ==
The lieutenant governor is the &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the senate, and may only cast a vote to break a tie. The president pro tempore is elected by the majority party caucus, followed by confirmation of the full senate. Other leaders, such as the majority and minority leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses according to each party&#x27;s strength in the chamber.

As of 2024, the president pro tempore is Democrat Mike McGuire of Geyserville. The majority leader is Democrat Lena Gonzalez of Long Beach, and the minority leader is Republican Brian Jones of Santee.

== Terms of office ==

Each state senator represents a population roughly equivalent to the State of Delaware. As a result of Proposition 140 in 1990 and Proposition 28 in 2012, members elected to the legislature prior to 2012 are restricted by term limits to two four-year terms (eight years), while those elected in or after 2012 are allowed to serve 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four-year state senate or two-year state assembly terms.

Members of the state senate serve four-year terms. Every two years, half of the senate&#x27;s 40 seats are subject to election. This is in contrast to the state assembly, in which all 80 seats in the assembly are subject to election every two years.

== Meeting chamber ==
The red tones of the California State Senate chamber are based on the British House of Lords, which is outfitted in a similar color. The dais rests along a wall shaped like an &quot;E&quot;, with its central projection housing the rostrum. The lower tier dais runs across the entire chamber, there are several chairs and computers used by the senate officers, the most prominent seat is reserved for the secretary who calls the roll. The higher tier is smaller, with three chairs, the two largest and most ornate chairs are used by the president pro tempore (right chair) and the lieutenant governor (left chair). The third and smallest chair, placed in the center, is used by the presiding officer (acting in place of the pro tem) and is rarely sat in as the president is expected to stand. There are four other chairs flanking the dais used by the highest non-member officials attending the senate, a foreign dignitary or state officer for example. Each of the 40 senators is provided a desk, microphone and two chairs, one for the senator, another for guests or legislative aides. Almost every decorating element is identical to the assembly chamber. Along the cornice appears a portrait of George Washington and the Latin quotation &quot;senatoris est civitatis libertatem tueri&quot; (&quot;It is the duty of the senator to guard the civil liberties of the Commonwealth&quot;).

<doc id="476072" wikidata="Q38677" url="?curid=476072" title="Dog breeding">
<text>Dog breeding is the practice of mating selected dogs with the intention of maintaining or producing specific qualities and characteristics. When dogs reproduce without such human intervention, their offspring&#x27;s characteristics are determined by natural selection, while &quot;dog breeding&quot; refers specifically to the artificial selection of dogs, in which dogs are intentionally bred by their owners. Breeding relies on the science of genetics, hence a breeder who is knowledgeable on canine genetics, health, and the intended purpose of the dogs attempts to breed suitable dogs.

== Terminology ==
The female parent of puppies is referred to as the &quot;dam&quot; and the male parent is referred to as the &quot;sire&quot;. A litter consists of the puppies born from the same pregnancy. A &quot;whelp&quot; is a newborn puppy and giving birth to dogs is called &quot;whelping&quot;. Dogs commonly give birth in a &quot;whelping box&quot;, a simple box or pen provided to the dam to help shelter and contain the puppies.

A person who intentionally mates dogs to produce puppies is referred to as a dog breeder. &quot;Line breeding&quot; is the planned breeding of dogs with their relatives. This is done to strengthen the appearance of specific desired traits in offspring. Line breeding is differentiated from inbreeding by excluding pairings between parents and offspring, and between full siblings. &quot;Outcrossing&quot; is the planned breeding between two unrelated dogs, used to increase genetic diversity in a breed and decrease genetic issues or abnormalities inherited from line breeding or inbreeding.

== Estrous cycle ==

Dogs reach puberty between 6 and 24 months old, at which age female dogs will start having an estrous cycle. There are four stages of estrous: proestrus, estrus, diestrus, and anestrus. A dog in estrus, also known as being &quot;in heat&quot;, can become pregnant during this 3- to 21-day period.

== Breeding and gestation ==
Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation. Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period. Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days in the fallopian tubes so if a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (ovum) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days. If she is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long.

==History==
Humans have maintained populations of useful animals around their places of habitat since pre-historic times. Over these millennia, domesticated dogs have developed into distinct types, or &quot;groups&quot;, such as livestock guardian dogs, hunting dogs, and sighthounds. To maintain these distinctions, humans have intentionally mated dogs with certain characteristics to encourage those characteristics in the offspring. Through this process, hundreds of dog breeds have been developed. Artificial selection in dog breeding has influenced behavior, shape, and size of dogs.

It is believed that when human civilization moved towards agrarian societies, dogs were selectively bred for smaller size and more docile behavior. These traits made it more comfortable for humans and dogs to live together. It has been seen that these traits can even prompt an adult female wolf to act more defensively of dog puppies than of wolf puppies. The example of canine neoteny goes even further, in that the various dog breeds are differently neotenized according to the type of behavior that was selected. Other researchers believe that because this comparison is based on the grey wolf, which might not be the ancestor of the dog, that this comparison is invalid. Further research indicates that the concept of neoteny as a means of distinguishing dogs from wolves is baseless.

With the development of breed clubs and kennel clubs during the mid-19th century, dog breeding became more rigorous and many breeds were developed during this time. Dog breeding became more systematic to preserve unique mutations such as shortened legs, a shortened face, new fur colors and textures. The increased popularity of dog shows that judged a dog&#x27;s look more than its working ability led to different goals when breeding. Dogs bred for show rather than performance tended to develop more exaggerated and extreme features to meet breed standards. One example of this change in breeding goals is the pronounced sloped back in the modern German Shepherd breed, compared to the straight back of working pedigrees. The Shar Pei is an example of how differing breed standards can influence the direction breeders take a dog and which traits are exaggerated. The Western Shar Pei has been bred to have a meatier mouth and more wrinkly skin than the traditional Chinese Shar Pei it originated from.

Initially, the ownership of working and purebred dogs, was a privilege of the wealthy. Today many people can afford to buy a dog. There are various reasons for people to breed dogs. Some people may have personal reasons, such as wanting to own or give away puppies, and are not interested in pedigree. Breeders may also breed dogs for profit, for show, because of an interest in a particular breed, or to correct some issue and improve the soundness of a breed. Responsible breeders take into consideration the temperament, as well as the health and appearance of the mating pair before breeding.

Breeders of purebred dogs can register the birth of a litter of puppies to a dog registry associated with a kennel club to record the parentage of the litter in stud books. Such registries maintain records of dogs’ lineage and are usually affiliated with kennel clubs, such as the AKC (American Kennel Club). Maintaining correct data is important for purebred dog breeding. Access to records allows a breeder to analyze the pedigrees and anticipate traits and behaviors that may be passed onto offspring. Requirements for the breeding of registered purebreds vary between breeds, countries, kennel clubs and registries. Breeders have to abide by the rules of the specific organization to participate in its breed maintenance and development programs. The rules may apply to the health of the dogs, such as joint x-rays, hip certifications, and eye examinations; to working qualities, such as passing a special test or achieving at a trial; to general conformation, such as evaluation of a dog by a breed expert. However, many registries, particularly those in North America, are not policing agencies that exclude dogs of poor quality or health. Their main function is simply to register puppies born of parents which are themselves registered.

==Criticism==
The genetic diversity of modern dog breeds is lower than both modern village dogs and a 5,000-year-old genome from a dog fossil found in Newgrange, Ireland, suggesting that modern breeding practices are partly responsible for the decline. During the early formative years of many breeds, breeders often crossed closely related dogs to create specific phenotypes, resulting in increased incidence of breed-specific genetic diseases.

Some dogs have certain inheritable characteristics that can develop into a disability or disease. Canine hip dysplasia is one such condition. Eye abnormalities, heart conditions, and some cases of deafness have been proven to be inherited. There have been extensive studies of these conditions, commonly sponsored by breed clubs and dog registries, while specialized breed clubs provide information of common genetic defects for their breeds. Also, special organizations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals collect data and provide it to breeders, as well as to the general public. Conditions such as hip dysplasia can impact some breeds more than others.

Some registries, such as American Kennel Club, may include a record of the absence of certain genetic defects, known as a certification, in an individual dog&#x27;s record. For example, the German Shepherd Dog national breed club in Germany recognizes that hip dysplasia is a genetic defect for dogs of this breed. Accordingly, it requires all dogs to pass evaluation for absence of hip dysplasia to register their progeny, and records the results in individual dog&#x27;s pedigrees. Many reputable breeders health test according to the breed club guidelines, or OFA guidelines.

There are BBC documentaries titled &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; and &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed – Three Years On&quot; that claim health problems in dogs from inbreeding. Some examples are problems with breathing in the Pug breed and Pekingese breed, spinal problems in the Dachshund breed, and Syringomyelia in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed.

Some scientific researchers argue that advances in artificial reproduction technology for the purposes of dog breeding can be helpful, but also have &quot;detrimental impacts&quot; when overused, overriding natural selection principles. These scientists call for a deeper understanding of natural selection, leading to a more naturalistic approach in dog breeding. It was concluded that &quot;findings imply that when selective breeding was done by humans, it squashed the snouts of certain dog breeds, it also morphed their brains.&quot;

Animal rights groups such as the International Society for Animal Rights and PETA believe that dog breeding, even by licensed responsible breeders, contributes to the pet overpopulation problem.

== Genetic diversity ==
Domestic dogs are phenotypically diverse mammals shown by differences in morphology and behavior across different breeds. Factors that contribute to this diversity are reproductive isolation, bottlenecks, and genetic drift. Data collected through owner reports suggests that genetic diversity has an effect on dogs&#x27; lifespan.

==Inbreeding depression==
Inbreeding depression is the reduced survival and fertility of offspring of related individuals. A study of 42,855 dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.

<text>Serial passage is the process of growing bacteria or a virus in iterations. For instance, a virus may be grown in one environment, and then a portion of that virus population can be removed and put into a new environment. This process is repeated with as many stages as desired, and then the final product is studied, often in comparison with the original virus.

This sort of facilitated transmission is often conducted in a laboratory setting, because it is of scientific interest to observe how the virus or bacterium that is being passed evolves over the course of the experiment. In particular, serial passage can be quite useful in studies that seek to alter the virulence of a virus or other pathogen. One consequence of this is that serial passage can be useful in creating vaccines, since scientists can apply serial passage and create a strain of a pathogen that has low virulence, yet has comparable immunogenicity to the original strain. This can also create strains that are more transmissible in addition to lower virulence, as demonstrated by A/H5N1 passage in ferrets.

==Mechanism==
Serial passage can either be performed in vitro or in vivo. In the in vitro method, a virus or a strain of bacteria will be isolated and allowed to grow for a certain time. After the sample has grown for that time, part of it will be transferred to a new environment and allowed to grow for the same period. This process will be repeated as many times as desired.

Alternatively, an in vivo experiment can be performed where an animal is infected with a pathogen, and this pathogen allowed time to grow in that host before a sample of it is removed from the host and passed to another host. This process is repeated for a certain number of hosts; the individual experiment determines this number.

When serial passage is performed either in vitro or in vivo, the virus or bacterium may evolve by mutating repeatedly. Identifying and studying mutations that occur often reveals information about the virus or bacterium being studied. Accordingly, after serial passage has been performed it can be valuable to compare the resulting virus or sample of bacteria to the original, noting any mutations that have occurred and their collective effects. Various significant outcomes may occur. The virulence of the virus may be changed, or a virus could evolve to become adapted to a different host environment than that in which it is typically found. Relatively few passages are necessary to produce a noticeable change in a virus; for instance, a virus can typically adapt to a new host within ten or so passages.

Because serial passage allows for rapid evolution of a virus to its host, it can be used to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance; specifically, for determining what mutations could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.

==History==
The technique of serial passage has been around since the 1800s. In particular, Louis Pasteur&#x27;s work with the rabies vaccine in the late 1800s exemplifies this method.

Pasteur created several vaccines over the course of his lifetime. His work prior to rabies involved attenuation of pathogens, but not through serial passage. In particular, Pasteur worked with cholera and found that if he cultured bacteria for long periods of time, he could create an effective vaccine. Pasteur thought that there was something special about oxygen and this was why he was able to attenuate (create a less virulent version of) the bacteria. Pasteur also tried to apply this method to create a vaccine for anthrax, although with less success.

Next, Pasteur wanted to apply this method to create a vaccine for rabies. However, rabies was, unbeknownst to him, caused by a virus, not a bacterial pathogen like cholera and anthrax, and for that reason rabies could not be cultured in the same way that cholera and anthrax could be. Methods for serial passage for viruses in vitro were not developed until the 1940s, when John Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Robbins developed a technique for this. These three scientists subsequently won the Nobel Prize for their major advancement.

To solve this problem, Pasteur worked with the rabies virus in vivo. In particular, he took brain tissue from an infected dog and transplanted it into another dog, repeating this process multiple times, and thus performing serial passage in dogs. These attempts increased the virulence of the virus. Then, he realized that he could put dog tissue into a monkey to infect it and then perform serial passage in monkeys. After completing this process and infecting a dog with the resulting virus, Pasteur realized that the virus was less virulent. Mostly, Pasteur worked with the rabies virus in rabbits. Ultimately, to create his vaccine for rabies, Pasteur used a simple method that involved drying out tissue. As is described in his notebook:

In a series of flasks in which air is maintained in a dry state…each day one suspends a thickness of fresh rabbit spinal tissue taken from a rabbit dead of rabies. Each day as well, one inoculates under the skin of a dog 1 mL of sterilized bouillion, in which has dispersed a small fragment of one of these desiccated spinal pieces, beginning with a piece most distant in time from when it was worked upon, in order to be sure that it is not at all virulent.

Pasteur mostly used other techniques besides serial passage to create his vaccines. However, the idea of attenuating a virus through serial passage still holds.

==Use in vaccines==
One way to attenuate a virus to a host is by passing the virus in a different species. The idea is that, as a strain of a virus becomes more adapted to a different species, that strain will become less adapted to the original host, thus decreasing in virulence with respect to the original host. This is the implicit principle that Louis Pasteur was unknowingly making use of when he passed the rabies virus in monkeys and ended up with a virus that was less dangerous to dogs, for example.

The process of serial passage yields a live vaccine. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this. Most notably, live vaccines are sometimes more effective and more long-lasting than inactivated or other types of vaccines. However, just as the virus evolved to become attenuated, it may reverse-evolve in the host, leading to infection.

==Experiments==
Researchers have conducted many experiments using serial passage. Some of the experimental uses for serial passage include changing the virulence of a virus, to study the adaptive evolution or potential evolution of zoonotic diseases to new hosts, and studying antibiotic resistance.

===Increasing virulence for use in animal modeling===
When developing vaccines for viruses, the emphasis is on attenuating the virus, or decreasing its virulence, in a given host. Sometimes it is useful to employ serial passage to increase the virulence of a virus. Usually, when serial passage is performed in a species, the result is a virus that is more virulent to that species.

For example, one study used serial passage in baboons to create a strain of HIV-2 that is particularly virulent to baboons. Typical strains of HIV-2 only infect baboons slowly. This specificity makes it challenging for scientists to use HIV-2 in animal models of HIV-1, because the animals in the model will only show symptoms slowly. The more virulent strain of HIV-2 could be practical for use in animal models, however.

Another study by Kanta Subbaro involved a serial passage experiment in which mice were infected with SARS. SARS usually does not make mice particularly sick, however, after the virus had undergone serial passage in the mice, it had become lethal.

Changing the virulence of SARS in this way was important, because without a virulent form of SARS to infect laboratory animals, scientists would have been unable to test the effects of SARS in an animal model.

More generally, this experiment also reflects a general medical principle: The virulence of a virus is mediated by the difficulty of its transmission.

Generally, if a virus kills its host too quickly, the host will not have a chance to come in contact with other hosts and transmit the virus before dying. In serial passage, when a virus was being transmitted from host to host regardless of its virulence, such as Subbaro&#x27;s experiment, the viruses that grow the fastest (and are therefore the most virulent) are selected for.

This principle has public health implications, because it suggests that, in very densely populated or overcrowded areas, such as slums or group quarantine facilities, natural selection may favour more virulent viruses.

This also helps explain why good hygiene is so important. Good hygiene selects against highly virulent viruses by lowering the ability of pathogens to transmit.

Serial passaging has been used to produce mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2.

===Influenza===
The H5N1 virus is a particularly lethal strain of influenza. Currently, it can infect humans, but it is not contagious between humans. Still, over 600 people worldwide are known to have died from animal-transmitted H5N1 virus, so the transmissibility of the virus is of major concern to scientists.

Several serial passage experiments have been conducted to determine the feasibility of the virus becoming transmissible in humans. In particular, Ron Fouchier and his colleagues did a 10-step serial passage experiment in ferrets. In doing so, they created a strain of influenza that not only infected ferrets, but was transmissible between ferrets. Notably, this strain was very similar to the original strain with which they had infected the first ferret—in other words, only a few mutations were necessary for the virus to become transmissible between ferrets. Similarly, researcher Yoshihiro Kawaoka found that a single mutation is necessary to make the virus transmissible in ferrets.

Both Fouchier&#x27;s research and Kawaoka&#x27;s research were initially censored, per implications for bioterrorism. The research was later published, but remained controversial.

Serial passage is an artificial technique that is used in a laboratory setting, rather than a natural process. Accordingly, the likelihood that the H5N1 virus would actually mutate to become transmissible in humans is unknown; however, researcher Derek Smith created an evolutionary model to show that this is possible.

===Understanding how viruses jump between species===
Another use of serial passage is in understanding how pathogens adapt to new species. By introducing a pathogen into a new host species and performing serial passage, scientists can observe as the pathogen adapts to its new host and pinpoint the mutations that allow for this adaptation.

<doc id="476088" wikidata="Q48971" url="?curid=476088" title="Susan Kare">
<text>Susan Kare ( &quot;care&quot;; born February 5, 1954) is an American artist and graphic designer, who contributed interface elements and typefaces for the first Apple Macintosh personal computer from 1983 to 1986. She was employee #10 and creative director at NeXT, the company formed by Steve Jobs after he left Apple in 1985. She has worked as a design consultant to Microsoft, IBM, Sony Pictures, Facebook, and Pinterest. , Kare is employed at Niantic Labs. As a pioneer of pixel art and of the graphical computer interface, she has been celebrated as one of the most significant designers of modern technology.

==Early life and education==
Kare was born in Ithaca, New York. Her father was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a research facility for the senses of taste and smell. Her mother taught her counted-thread embroidery as she immersed herself in drawings, paintings, and crafts. Her brother was aerospace engineer Jordin Kare. She graduated from Harriton High School in 1971. She graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a B.A. in art from Mount Holyoke College in 1975, with an undergraduate honors thesis on mathematics. She received an M.A. and a Ph.D. in fine arts from New York University in 1978 with a doctoral dissertation on &quot;the use of caricature in selected sculptures of Honoré Daumier and Claes Oldenburg&quot;. Her goal was &quot;to be either a fine artist or teacher&quot;.

==Career==
===Early===
Susan Kare&#x27;s career has always focused on fine art. For several summers during high school she interned at the Franklin Institute for designer Harry Loucks, who introduced her to typography and graphic design while she did phototypesetting with &quot;strips of type for labels in a dark room on a PhotoTypositor&quot;. Because she did not attend an artist training school, she built her experience and portfolio by taking many pro-bono graphics jobs such as posters and brochure design in college, holiday cards, and invitations. After her Ph.D., she moved to San Francisco to work at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF), as sculptor and occasional curator. She later reflected that her &quot;ideal life would be to make art full-time but that sculpture was too solitary&quot;.

===Apple===

In 1982, Kare was welding a life-sized razorback hog sculpture commissioned by an Arkansas museum when she received a phone call from high school friend Andy Hertzfeld. In exchange for an Apple II computer, he solicited her to hand-draw a few icons and font elements to inspire the upcoming Macintosh computer. However, she had no experience in computer graphics and &quot;didn&#x27;t know the first thing about designing a typeface&quot; or pixel art so she drew heavily upon her fine art experience in mosaics, needlepoint, and pointillism. He suggested that she get a grid notebook of the smallest graph paper she could find at the University Art store in Palo Alto and mock up several representations of his software commands and applications. This includes an icon of scissors for the &quot;cut&quot; command, a finger for &quot;paste&quot;, and a paintbrush for MacPaint. Compelled to actually join the team for a fixed-length part-time job, she interviewed &quot;totally green&quot; but undaunted, bringing a variety of typography books from the Palo Alto public library to show her interest alongside her well-prepared notebook. She &quot;aced&quot; the interview and was hired in January 1983 with Badge #3978. Her business cards read &quot;Macintosh Artist&quot;.

As a computer novice in the target market of the Macintosh, she easily grasped the Twiggy-based Macintosh prototype which &quot;felt like a magical leap forward&quot; for art design. She preferred it over the Apple II and was amazed and excited by the computer screen&#x27;s design capability to undo, redo, and iterate an icon or letterform while seeing it simultaneously at enlarged and 100% target sizes. She immediately embraced Bill Atkinson&#x27;s existing rudimentary graphics software tools and applications, to toggle pixels on and off and convert the resulting images to hexadecimal code for keyboard input. More advanced graphical tools were written for her by Hertzfeld, and she embellished the flagship application MacPaint&#x27;s user interface while the programmers matured it to become her primary tool. She contributed to the Macintosh identity and devised ways to make the machine humanized, intuitively usable, relatable, and inviting.

Her whimsical personality was essential to the infectiously budding culture and lore of the early Macintosh team, and infused into the product. She stunned the staff of accomplished pixel artists and engineers with her unexpectedly personable renditions of their portraits in the Mac&#x27;s standard pixel monochrome resolution for icons. She and Steve Capps sewed a Jolly Roger pirate flag with a rainbow colored Apple logo eyepatch, as the christening brand of the new Macintosh headquarters at Brandley 3, embracing Steve Jobs&#x27; ethos &quot;it&#x27;s better to be a pirate than to join the Navy&quot;. Working as the only graphic designer in a diverse and articulate team of programmers and with Hertzfeld as the primary requester, she spent hours or days at a time developing a rich selection of graphics for the consensus-driven feedback loop for each GUI element. Jobs personally approved each of her main desktop icons. Kare participated heavily in the prerelease marketing campaign for the Macintosh in 1983 by posing for magazine photo shoots, appearing in television advertisements, and demonstrating the Mac on television talk shows.

In only one year, she designed the core visual design language of the original Macintosh which launched in January 1984. This includes original marketing material and many typefaces and icons, some of which became patented. As a whole platform of their own, these designs comprise the first visual language for the identity of the Macintosh and for Apple&#x27;s pioneering of graphical user interface (GUI) computing.

She refined Apple&#x27;s existing iconography and desktop metaphors imported from the Macintosh&#x27;s predecessor, the Lisa, such as the trash can, dog-eared paper icon, and I-beam cursor. She devised the practice of associating unique document icons with their creator applications. The team&#x27;s GUI elements such as the Lasso, the Grabber, and the Paint Bucket became universal staples of computing. Her original cult classic icons include Clarus the Dogcow seen in the print dialog box, the Happy Mac icon of the smiling computer that welcomes users at system startup, and the Command key symbol on Apple keyboards. Aligned with Steve Jobs&#x27;s passion for calligraphy, she designed the world&#x27;s first proportionally spaced digital font family including Chicago and Geneva, and the monospaced Monaco. Chicago is her first font, made especially for systemwide use in menus and dialog; it has a bold vertical look initially named Elefont, in which Kare implemented Jobs&#x27;s idea of variable spacing, where each character can have the unique pixel width that it needs, to differentiate the computer from a monospaced typewriter. Cairo is a set of icons in font form, for combining graphics directly into text, akin to &quot;proto-emojis&quot;.

She became a Creative Director in Apple Creative Services working for the department director, Tom Suiter, &quot;at a time when it seemed as if the main Mac development was over&quot;.

&quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; summarizes her groundbreaking Macintosh work: &quot;It was an intense time with untold pressure to perform on a new product launch that demanded countless hours of work, rework and work again to get everything right.&quot; Kare recalled the privilege of being directly taught by engineers how early software is assembled: &quot;I loved working on that project—always felt so lucky for the opportunity to be a nontechnical person in a software group. I was awed by being able to collaborate with such creative, capable and dedicated engineers. My ‘work/life balance’ has improved since &quot;

===After Apple===
In 1986, Kare followed Steve Jobs in leaving Apple to launch NeXT, Inc. as its Creative Director and 10th employee. She introduced Jobs to her design hero Paul Rand and hired him to design NeXT&#x27;s logo and brand identity, admiring his table-pounding exactitude and confidence. She created and re-created slideshows to Jobs&#x27;s exacting last-minute requirements.

She realized that she wanted &quot;to be back doing bitmaps&quot; so she left NeXT to become an independent designer with a client base including graphical computing giants Microsoft, IBM, Sony Pictures, Motorola, General Magic, and Intel. Her projects for Microsoft include the card deck for Windows 3.0&#x27;s solitaire game, which taught early computer users to use a mouse to drag and drop objects on a screen. In 1987, she designed a &quot;baroque&quot; wallpaper, numerous other icons, and design elements for Windows 3.0, using isometric 3D and 16 dithered colors. Many of her icons, such as those for Notepad and various Control Panels, remained essentially unchanged by Microsoft until Windows XP. For IBM, she produced pinstriped isometric bitmap icons and design elements for OS/2. For General Magic, she made Magic Cap&#x27;s &quot;impish&quot; cartoon of dad&#x27;s office desktop. She was a founding partner of Susan Kare LLP in 1989. For Eazel, she rejoined many from the former Macintosh team and contributed iconography to the Nautilus file manager which the company permanently donated to the public for free use.

In 2003, she became a member of the advisory board of Glam Media, now called Mode Media. In 2003, she was recommended by Nancy Pelosi as one of four appointments to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for designing coins for the United States Mint.

Between 2006 and 2010, she produced hundreds of icons for the virtual gifts feature of Facebook. Initially, profits from gift sales were donated to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation until Valentine&#x27;s Day 2007. One of the gift icons, titled &quot;Big Kiss&quot; is featured in some versions of Mac OS X as a user account picture.

In 2007, she designed the identity, icons, and website for Chumby Industries, Inc., as well as the interface for its Internet-enabled alarm clock.

Since 2008, The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) store in New York City has carried stationery and notebooks featuring her designs.

In 2015, MoMA acquired her notebooks of sketches for the original Macintosh user interface.

In August 2012, she was called as an expert witness by Apple in the patent-infringement trial &quot;Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co.&quot;.

In 2015, Kare was hired by Pinterest as a product design lead as her first corporate employment in three decades. Working with design manager Bob Baxley, the former design manager of the original Apple Online Store, she compared the diverse and design-driven corporate cultures of Pinterest and early 1980s Apple. In February 2021, Kare became Design Architect at Niantic Labs. , she concurrently heads a digital design practice in San Francisco and sells limited-edition, signed fine-art prints.

===Design philosophy===
Kare&#x27;s design principles are meaning, memorability, and clarity. She echoes the advice of Paul Rand, &quot;Don&#x27;t try to be original, just try to be good&quot;. She focuses on simplicity in creating visual metaphors for computer commands. Designing for the fullest range of users from novice to expert, she believes that the most meaningful icons are instantly easy to both understand and remember. She said &quot;an icon is successful if you could tell someone what it is once and they don&#x27;t forget it.&quot; She said &quot;good icons should function somewhat like traffic signssimple symbols with few extraneous details, which makes them more universal&quot; and notes that there is no impetus to continuously modernize a stop sign. Using the same philosophy through the pixel art era and beyond, she has placed a &quot;premium on context and metaphor&quot;, hunting the streets of San Francisco for inspiration from &quot;catchy symbols and shapes&quot;. When stuck on a design, she resourced inspiration from the books &quot;Kanji Pictograms&quot; for its table of the real-world origins of Japanese characters, and &quot;Symbol Sourcebook&quot;, especially its reference for hobo graffiti.

Her primary objective with the Macintosh was to humanize it, make it seem less like a machine, and give it &quot;a smile&quot;. She intended to bring &quot;an artist&#x27;s sensibility to a world that had been the exclusive domain of engineers and programmers&quot; and &quot;hoped to help counter the stereotypical image of computers as cold and intimidating&quot;. Her Macintosh icons were inspired by many sources such as art history, wacky gadgets, pirate lore, Japanese logograms, and forgotten hieroglyphics. On the Mac keyboard, her concept for the command symbol was taken from the Saint Hannes cross, which is a symbol for a place of cultural interest used by Scandinavians of the 1960s such as at Swedish campgrounds.

She thrived in the problem-solving approach to severe technological constraints of the 1980s, drawing heavily upon her fine art experience in mosaics, needlepoint, and pointillism. Considering to be generous for icons, this improvised mastery of &quot;a peculiar sort of minimal pointillism&quot; made her an early pioneer of pixel art. For example, her original fonts are constrained to per character, yet she solved the problem of the typical jagged look of existing monospaced computer typefaces by using only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree lines. Veteran designers at Apple had previously thought it impossible to convey personality and accuracy in a human portrait of only until Kare did it.

Since the late 1980s, she uses Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator using a grid-like template to simulate the constraints of the target device and user experience. She has said that she would still prefer monochrome pixel art.

===Reception===
The Smithsonian Institution called her design language &quot;simple, elegant, and whimsical&quot;. In 2015, the Museum of Modern Art exhibited the first physical representation of her iconography, including her original Grid sketchbook, saying &quot;If the Mac turned out to be such a revolutionary object––a pet instead of a home appliance, a spark for the imagination instead of a mere work tool––it is thanks to Susan&#x27;s fonts and icons, which gave it voice, personality, style, and even a sense of humor. Cherry bomb, anyone?&quot; They called her &quot;a pioneering and influential computer iconographer [whose icon designs] communicate their function immediately and memorably, with wit and style.&quot; The American Institute of Graphic Arts characterized her style as a &quot;whimsical charm and an independent streak&quot; with an &quot;artistic sleight of hand&quot; and awarded her with its medal in April 2018. In October 2019, Kare was awarded the National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement by Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. On International Women&#x27;s Day of 2018, &quot;Medium&quot; acknowledged Kare as a technologist who helped shape the modern world alongside programmer Ada Lovelace, computer scientist Grace Hopper, and astronaut Mae Jemison.

In 1997, &quot;I.D.&quot; magazine launched its I.D. Forty list of influential designers including Kare and Steve Jobs. In October 2001, she received the Chrysler Design Award.

===Legacy===
Susan Kare is considered a pioneer of pixel art and of the graphical user interface, having spent three decades of her career &quot;at the apex of human-machine interaction&quot;.

In co-creating the original Macintosh computer and documentation, she drove the visual language for Apple&#x27;s pioneering graphical computing. Her most recognizable and enduring works at Apple include the world&#x27;s first proportionally spaced digital font family of the Chicago, Geneva, and Monaco typefaces, and countless icons and interface components such as the Lasso, the Grabber, and the Paint Bucket. Chicago is the most prominent user-interface typeface seen in classic Mac OS interfaces from System 1 in 1984 to Mac OS 9 in 1999, and in the first four generations of the iPod interface. This cumulative work was key in making the Macintosh one of the most successful and foundational computing platforms of all time. Descendants of her groundbreaking 1980s work at Apple are universally seen throughout computing and in print.

For decades, she seeded this visual language practice throughout the industry via industry giants such as Microsoft Windows, IBM OS/2, Facebook, and Pinterest.

Her icon portfolio has been featured as physical prints in the National Museum of American History, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. Her work has a cult following, and large print versions of her digital portfolio are sold privately and at MoMA.

==Personal life==
She was married to Jay Tannenbaum. Their marriage was dissolved in 2011. She has three sons with him. Her brother was aerospace engineer Jordin Kare.

<text>Windsor is a community located in Hants County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a service centre for the western part of the county and is situated on Highway 101.

The community has a history dating back to its use by the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation for several millennia prior to European colonization. When the Acadians lived in the area, the town was raided by New England forces in 1704. The area was central to both Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War and the Expulsion of the Acadians during the Bay of Fundy Campaign in 1755. The town promotes itself as the birthplace of ice hockey and was the home of Canada&#x27;s first internationally best-selling author, Thomas Chandler Haliburton.

On April 1, 2020, the Town of Windsor amalgamated with the District of West Hants to become the West Hants Regional Municipality.

== History ==
Having migrated from Port Royal, Nova Scotia, the Acadians were the first Europeans to settle in Pisiguit by the early 1680s. French census records dated 1686 list well established farms utilizing dyked marshlands.

=== Queen Anne&#x27;s War ===

==== Raid on Pisiquid (1704) ====
During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in response to the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia military campaign against the New England frontier and the Canadian Raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts, Benjamin Church led the Raid on Pisiquid (1704) and burned the village to the ground. In the Raid on Pisiquid, Church burned 40 houses along with out-buildings, crops and cattle. There was resistance and two Mi&#x27;kmaq were wounded.

===Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War===
Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq. Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749. By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi&#x27;kmaq (1726), which were signed after Dummer&#x27;s War. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi&#x27;kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1751), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754).

Within 18 months of establishing Halifax, the British also took firm control of peninsula Nova Scotia by building fortifications in all the major Acadian communities: present-day Windsor (Fort Edward); Grand Pre (Fort Vieux Logis) and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence). (A British fort already existed at the other major Acadian centre of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Cobequid remained without a fort.) Many Acadians left this region in the Acadian Exodus, which preceded the Expulsion of the Acadians.

=== French and Indian War ===

During the French and Indian War, Fort Edward and Windsor played a significant role in the deportation, particularly the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). Acadians were imprisoned in the fort as they were notified about the expulsion. Acadians numbering in the thousands were deported from mainland Nova Scotia. The deportees frequently were held on board ships for several weeks before being moved to their destinations, thus exacerbating unhealthy conditions below decks and leading to the deaths of hundreds. Many hundreds more were lost through ship sinkings and disease on board ships while en route to ports in Britain&#x27;s American colonies, Britain, and France. The British also broke apart families and sent them to different places. Their justification for this was to more efficiently put people on the boats. This resulted in more loss of life as families could not survive without essential members.

=== New England Planters ===
The Township of Windsor was founded in 1764 by New England Planters. The next year, its first Agricultural Fair was held. This fair is still continued today, and is the oldest and longest-running such fair in North America.

=== American Revolution ===
In the American Revolution, Windsor was an important British stronghold. Fort Edward was the headquarters in Atlantic Canada for 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants). A relief force was mustered at Windsor to crush the American-led siege at the Battle of Fort Cumberland in 1776.

=== Loyalists ===
Following the American Revolution, Windsor was settled by United Empire Loyalists.

=== Plaster War ===
Windsor developed its gypsum deposits, usually selling it to American markets at Passamaquoddy Bay. Often this trade was illegal; in 1820, an effort to stop this smuggling trade resulted in the &quot;Plaster War,&quot; in which local smugglers resoundingly defeated the efforts of New Brunswick officials to bring the trade under their control.

=== Kings ===
The University of King&#x27;s College and its secondary school, King&#x27;s Collegiate School, were founded in 1788-1789 by United Empire Loyalists as Anglican academic institutions. The college remained in the community until a disastrous fire on February 3, 1920. In 1922 it moved to Halifax, with the assistance of the Carnegie Foundation and continues to this day.

The King&#x27;s Collegiate School continued operation on the campus and was joined by a sister girls school, &#x27;Edgehill School&#x27;, in 1890. In 1976 both institutions merged to form King&#x27;s-Edgehill School, and remains the oldest independent (i.e. private) school in the Commonwealth outside of the United Kingdom.

=== Haliburton ===
Thomas Chandler Haliburton brought fame to Windsor during the 19th century with his writings about a clockmaker named Sam Slick.

=== Ships, rail and roads ===
In 1878, Windsor was officially incorporated as a town. Its harbour made the town a centre for shipping and shipbuilding during the age of sail. Notable shipbuilders such as Bennett Smith built a large fleet of merchant vessels, one of the last being the ship &quot;Black Watch&quot;. As the port of registry for the massive wooden shipbuilding industry of the Minas Basin, Windsor was the homeport of one of the largest fleet of sailing ships in Canada. Notable vessels registered at Windsor included Hamburg, the largest three masted barque built in Canada, and Kings County, the largest four masted barque. 

Following the completion of the Nova Scotia Railway&#x27;s line from Halifax in 1857, the town became an important steamship connection giving Halifax access to the Bay of Fundy shipping routes. The railway continued westward as the Windsor and Annapolis Railway in 1870, eventually connecting to Yarmouth as the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1893. 

Windsor was victim to a disastrous fire on October 17, 1897 which destroyed about eighty percent of the downtown and displaced about 2,500 people. Rebuilding took several years. 

In 1901 the Midland Railway was built across Hants County, connecting Windsor with Truro. The central location of Windsor on the railway fostered the growth of numerous factories such as textile mills, fertilizer plants and furniture factories. The home of one of the industrialist families of this era, the Shands, is preserved today in Windsor as the Shand House Museum. 

Windsor was affected by another major fire on 6 January 1924, which destroyed part of the town.

The Windsor and Hantsport Railway took over operations from the Dominion Atlantic in 1993, making Windsor its headquarters. Rail service continued until 2011 when a crash in the gypsum market ended gypsum shipments and the railway was mothballed.

In 1970, the construction of a flood-control causeway carrying Highway 101 and the Dominion Atlantic Railway across the Avon River closed Windsor off from shipping and has affected navigation in the Avon River downstream from the causeway due to excessive siltation. Highway 101 is scheduled to be upgraded to a 4-lane expressway in the future and there have been discussions about replacing the causeway with railroad and highway bridges to improve water flow. Today, the Avon River on the upstream side of the causeway which is obstructed from freely flowing into the Bay of Fundy is called &#x27;Lake Pisiquid&#x27;.

==Geography==
Situated at the junction of the Avon and St. Croix Rivers, it is the largest community in the District of the Municipality of West Hants and had a 2001 population of = 3,779 residents. Prior to the county being divided into separate municipal districts, Windsor had served as the shire town of the county. The region encompassing present day Windsor was originally part of Pisiguit, a Mi&#x27;kmaq term meaning &quot;Junction of Waters&quot;. This name referred to the confluence of the Avon and St. Croix rivers, which flow into the Minas Basin.

=== Climate ===

The highest temperature ever recorded in Windsor was on 19 August 1935. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 7 February 1993.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Former Town of Windsor recorded a population of 3,425 living in 1,556 of its 1,679 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 3,648. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016 

==Arts and culture==
The world&#x27;s very first pumpkin regatta was held in Windsor in 1999 where people carve out The Giant Pumpkins and race across lake Pisiquid. This weird regatta now includes a motorized class where a motor is attached to the pumpkin with a flotation device.

Windsor is the location of the Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia. The theatre supports a touring troupe, which performs locally and internationally, as well as many children&#x27;s theatre programs.

== Attractions ==
Windsor, NS is home to numerous attractions beginning with the claim to being the birthplace of hockey. Windsor is home to both the Cradle of Hockey which is home to Long Pond where hockey began beside Howard Dill&#x27;s Farm.

===Parks===
*Falls Lake Provincial Park
*Victoria Park
*Windsor Playland Park
*Windsor Waterfront Skatepark

=== Ice hockey ===
Windsor maintains a claim as the birthplace of hockey, based upon a reference (in a novel by Thomas Haliburton) of boys from King&#x27;s Collegiate School playing &quot;hurley&quot;, on the frozen waters of Long Pond adjacent to the school&#x27;s campus during the early 19th century. Students from King&#x27;s-Edgehill School still play hockey on Long Pond, a pond proclaimed by some as the &quot;Cradle of Hockey&quot;, located at the farm of Howard Dill. Windsor also boasts the oldest hockey arena in Canada, the Stannus Street Rink, which no longer hosts hockey games. The town&#x27;s current arena is Hants Exhibition Arena. The town was also recently involved in the shooting of a television series called Road Hockey Rumble. The town of Windsor was also home to the historic Windsor Royals Jr. B Hockey Club, as well as the Avon River Rats Jr. C Hockey Club. The Windsor Royals Jr. B club ceased playing in the spring of 2012, but was ultimately replaced by the Valley Maple Leafs. Facing issues regarding their copyright, in June 2018 the River Rats revived the Royals brand. However, the newly named team lasted just one season before relocating to Chester, Nova Scotia as the Castaways.

==Government==
The town operates under a Council/Manager system of local government consisting of current elected Mayor Anna Allen, current Deputy Mayor Laurie Murley, three elected Councillors, Dave Sealey, Liz Galbraith, and John Bergante and a Chief Administrative Officer, Louis Coutinho.

<doc id="476094" wikidata="Q107152" url="?curid=476094" title="Coat of arms of Cameroon">
<text>The coat of arms of Cameroon consists of a shield with a banner above and below it. Behind the shield are two crossed fasces. The shield has the same color pattern as the flag of Cameroon, and in the center is a map of the nation. The scales of justice are superimposed on top of the map of the nation since 1984.

==Description==
The constitution of Cameroon describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The coat of arms of the Republic of Cameroon shall be an escutcheon surmounted chief by the legend &quot;Republic of Cameroon&quot; and supported by two crossed fasces with the motto &quot;Peace-Work-Fatherland&quot; base.&quot;

&quot;The escutcheon shall be composed of a star on a field [vert] and triangle gules, charged with the geographical outline of Cameroon azure, and surcharged with the sword and scales of justice sable.&quot;

The previous version of the state arms had text in French only, with &quot;République du Cameroun – 1er Janvier 1960&quot; on a scroll above the shield, and &quot;&quot; below the shield. The shield differed in that the green and yellow areas to left and right each had one large blue five-pointed star, while the central red area did not have a star on top (so that the blue map outline of Cameroon extended higher).

== Historic coats of arms ==
===Colonial era===
In 1914, the German government decided to assign coats of arms to its overseas colonies, including Cameroon. Arms were designed, but World War I broke out before the project was finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion. The arms proposed for the Imperial Colony of Cameroon depicted an elephant&#x27;s head and the German imperial eagle on a chief. The eagle and the imperial crown on the shield was the same for all the proposed colonial arms.

<doc id="476095" wikidata="Q287621" url="?curid=476095" title="List of presidents of Honduras">
<text>This article lists the [[President of Honduras|president]]s of [[Honduras]], since the country declared its independence from the Spanish Empire on 15 September 1821.

== Heads of state of Honduras within the Federal Republic of Central America (1821–1839) ==

On 1 July 1823 Honduras, along with Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, declared its independence from the First Mexican Empire to form the short lived Federal Republic of Central America, also known as United Provinces of Central America. Honduras remained as a member state until it decided to separate in 1838. The entire union dissolved in civil war between 5 November 1838, when Nicaragua separated from the federation, and about 1840.

== Presidents of independent Honduras (1839–present) ==
Honduras declared itself independent on 15 November 1838, and a constitution was formally adopted in January 1839. After a period of instability, conservative General Francisco Ferrera became the first elected president of the country for a two-year term, but then extended his &quot;de facto&quot; control of the nation for the next five years.

Most presidents after 1900 represent one of the two dominant political parties, the Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH) and the National Party of Honduras (PNH).

The most recent general election was held on 28 November 2021, with Xiomara Castro of Libre elected president, taking office on 27 January 2022.

<doc id="476099" wikidata="Q234679" url="?curid=476099" title="Charlotte Rampling">
<text>Tessa Charlotte Rampling (born 5 February 1946) is an English actress. An icon of the Swinging Sixties, she began her career as a model. She was cast in the role of Meredith in the 1966 film &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, which starred Lynn Redgrave. She soon began making French and Italian arthouse films, notably Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Damned&quot; (1969) and Liliana Cavani&#x27;s &quot;The Night Porter&quot; (1974). She went on to star in many European and English-language films, including &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), &quot;Long Live Life&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1997). In the 2000s, she became the muse of French director François Ozon, appearing in several of his films, notably &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2003) and &quot;Young &amp; Beautiful&quot; (2013). On television, she is known for her role as Dr. Evelyn Vogel in &quot;Dexter&quot; (2013).

In 2002 she released an album of recordings in the style of cabaret, titled &quot;Like a Woman&quot;.

In 2012 she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, both for her performance in the miniseries &quot;Restless&quot;. For her performance in the 2015 film &quot;45 Years&quot;, she won the Berlin Film Festival Award for Best Actress, the European Film Award for Best Actress, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

In 2017, she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 74th Venice International Film Festival for &quot;Hannah&quot;. She received an Honorary César in 2001 and France&#x27;s Legion of Honour in 2002. She was made an OBE in 2000 for her services to the arts, and received the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award from the European Film Awards.

In 2015, she released her autobiography, which she wrote in French, titled &quot;Qui Je Suis&quot;. She later worked on an English translation, titled &quot;Who I Am&quot;, which was published in March 2017.

==Early life==
Rampling was born in 1946 in Sturmer, Essex, the daughter of Isabel Anne (née Gurteen; 1918–2001), a painter, and Godfrey Rampling (1909–2009), an Olympic gold medallist runner and British Army officer. She spent most of her early life in Gibraltar, France and Spain, before she returned to the UK in 1964.

She attended Académie Jeanne d&#x27;Arc in Versailles and St Hilda&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Bushey, Hertfordshire, England. She had one sister, Sarah, who died by suicide in 1966, aged 23. She and Sarah had a close relationship and they had performed in a cabaret act together during their young years.

==Career==

=== 1960s: Modelling career, starting as actress ===
Rampling made her stage debut at the age of 14, singing French chansons with her sister at Bernays Institute in Stanmore. She began her career as a model and first appeared in a Cadbury advertisement. She was working as a secretary when she was noticed by a casting agent in the same building. She made uncredited appearances in two films directed by Richard Lester including his first film with the Beatles, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), and as a water skier in &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965). In 1965, she was cast in the role of Meredith in the film &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; and was given a role by John Boulting in the comedy &quot;Rotten to the Core&quot;. In 1967, she starred opposite Yul Brynner in the adventure film &quot;The Long Duel&quot;. She also appeared alongside Franco Nero in the Italian film &quot;Sardinia Kidnapped&quot; (&quot;Sequestro di persona&quot;) (1968), directed by Gianfranco Mingozzi.

On television, Rampling played the gunfighter Hana Wilde in &quot;The Superlative Seven&quot;, a 1967 episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot; in which she knocked out John Steed. In 1969, she starred opposite Sam Waterston in the romance-drama &quot;Three&quot;, and in 1972, she starred opposite Robert Blake in the drama &quot;Corky&quot; and portrayed Anne Boleyn in the costume drama &quot;Henry VIII and His Six Wives&quot;. After this, her acting career blossomed in both English and French cinema.

Despite an early flurry of success, she told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;We weren&#x27;t happy. It was a nightmare, breaking the rules and all that. Everyone seemed to be having fun, but they were taking so many drugs they wouldn&#x27;t know it anyway.&quot;

Rampling has performed controversial roles. In 1969, in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Damned&quot; (&quot;La Caduta degli dei&quot;), she played a young wife sent to a Nazi concentration camp. Critics praised her performance, and it cast her in a whole new image: mysterious, sensitive, and ultimately tragic. &quot;The Look&quot;, as her co-star Dirk Bogarde called it, became her trademark.

=== 1970–early 1980s: mature roles, Hollywood, and Italian cinema ===
She appeared in the cult classic &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, in a scene deleted from the U.S. theatrical release (included in the U.K. release). Lead actor Barry Newman remarked that the scene was of aid in the allegorical lilt of the film.

In 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Night Porter&quot;, in which she again appears alongside Dirk Bogarde, she plays a former concentration camp inmate who, after World War II, reunites with a former camp guard (Bogarde) with whom she had had an ambiguous, sadomasochistic relationship. Their relationship resumes, and she becomes his mistress and victim once again. In 1974, she posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; photographs by Helmut Newton. In 1976 she co-presented for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration Award with Anthony Hopkins at the 48th Academy Awards.

In 1974, Rampling starred in John Boorman&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Zardoz&quot; opposite Sean Connery. She also starred with Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1976) and with Richard Harris in &quot;Orca&quot; (1977). She gained recognition from American audiences as the leading lady in a well-received remake of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s detective story &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1975) starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe, and later with Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), and in &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), an acclaimed drama directed by Sidney Lumet that starred Paul Newman.

===Middle 1980s and 1990s===
Rampling starred in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Viva la vie (Long Live Life)&quot;, before going on to star in the cult-film &quot;Max, Mon Amour&quot; (1986), and appear in the thriller &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987). For a decade she withdrew from the public eye due to depression. In the late 1990s, she appeared in &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot; (1997), played Miss Havisham in a BBC television adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1998), and starred in the film adaptation of Anton Chekov’s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (1999), directed by Michael Cacoyannis.. In 1997, she was a jury member at the 54th Venice International Film Festival.

=== 2000s ===
Rampling credits François Ozon with drawing her back to film in the 2000s, a period when she came to terms with the death of her elder sister Sarah who, after giving birth prematurely in 1966, died by suicide at 23. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I thought that after such a long time of not letting her be with me. I would like to bring her back into my life.&quot; The character she played in Ozon&#x27;s &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2003), Sarah Morton, was named in her sister&#x27;s honour.

For most of Rampling&#x27;s life, she said that her sister had died of a brain haemorrhage; when she and her father learned of Sarah’s death, they agreed they never would let her mother know the truth. They kept their secret until Rampling&#x27;s mother died in 2001.

Rampling appeared in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001), and she earned César Award nominations for &quot;Under the Sand&quot; (2000), &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2003), and &quot;Lemming&quot; (2005). At 59, she appeared in Laurent Cantet&#x27;s &quot;Heading South&quot; (&quot;Vers le Sud&quot;), a 2005 film about sexual tourism. She appeared as Ellen, a professor of French literature, who holidays in 1970s Haiti to get the sexual attention she does not get at home.

Hideo Kojima used Rampling&#x27;s likeness for The Boss, the main antagonist of his game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, released in 2004.

On her choice of roles, Rampling said &quot;I generally don&#x27;t make films to entertain people. I choose the parts that challenge me to break through my own barriers. A need to devour, punish, humiliate or surrender seems to be a primal part of human nature, and it&#x27;s certainly a big part of sex. To discover what normal means, you have to surf a tide of weirdness.&quot;

The actress has continued to work in sexually provocative films, such as &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot; (2006). In 2008, she portrayed Countess Spencer, the mother of Keira Knightley&#x27;s title character, in &quot;The Duchess&quot; and played the High Priestess in post-apocalyptic thriller &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot; In 2002, she recorded an album titled &quot;Comme Une Femme&quot;, or &quot;As A Woman&quot;. It is in both French and English, and includes passages that are spoken word as well as selections which Rampling sang.. In February 2006, Rampling was named as the jury president at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival.

She has been seen on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot; magazines and &quot;CRUSHfanzine&quot;. In 2009, she posed nude in front of the Mona Lisa for Juergen Teller. In 2009, Rampling appeared in Todd Solondz&#x27;s &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010, she completed filming &quot;Cleanskin&quot;, a terrorist thriller, and played Miss Emily in the dystopian romantic fantasy &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;. She also appeared as Helena in the dance drama &quot;StreetDance 3D&quot; and the nun Mary in &quot;The Mill and the Cross&quot; with Michael York and Rutger Hauer. 2011 saw Rampling play Elizabeth Hunter in the Fred Schepisi directed adaptation of Australian Nobel laureate Patrick White&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot; (with Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush). In 2011 she also appeared in Lars Von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Melancholia&quot;. For her role in the 2012 miniseries &quot;Restless&quot;, Rampling was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2013, she appeared as Dr. Evelyn Vogel in the eighth season of &quot;Dexter&quot;.

Other television roles include the ITV drama &quot;Broadchurch&quot; (2015) and the BBC drama &quot;London Spy&quot; (2015). In 2014, she was named the new face of NARS Cosmetics to launch their new lipstick campaign.

In 2015, Rampling starred with Tom Courtenay in Andrew Haigh&#x27;s &quot;45 Years&quot;. The film is about a couple preparing to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary when new information regarding the husband&#x27;s missing previous lover arises. &quot;45 Years&quot; was screened in the main competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival. She won the Silver Bear for Best Actress and Tom Courtenay won the Silver Bear for Best Actor. For this role, she also won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the European Film Award for Best Actress, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and also received nominations for the BIFA for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.

In 2016, Rampling said that efforts to boycott that year&#x27;s Oscars ceremony over a lack of racial diversity among nominees were &quot;racist to whites&quot;. Her comments were called &quot;offensive, outrageous and ignorant&quot; by Chelsea Clinton, and the comments were defended by Clint Eastwood. Rampling later apologised for her comments and expressed regret that her statements were misinterpreted.

That same year, Rampling backed children&#x27;s fairytales app, GivingTales, in aid of UNICEF together with Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, Michael Caine, David Walliams, Paul McKenna and Michael Ball.

In 2017, Rampling co-starred as Veronica Ford with Jim Broadbent and Emily Mortimer in &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot;, based on the novel by Julian Barnes.

Rampling was originally cast as Lady Jessica in Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s failed adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot; in the 1970s, but left the project in disgust after reading a scene in the script where 2,000 extras defecated at once.

Rampling plays a grouchy grandmother in New Zealand writer-director Matthew J. Saville&#x27;s 2021 black comedy &quot;Juniper&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1972, Rampling married New Zealand actor and publicist Bryan Southcombe and had a son, Barnaby Southcombe (who became a television director), before divorcing in 1976. The couple was reported to have been living in a ménage à trois with Randall Laurence, a male model, and in 1974, Rampling was quoted by the syndicated columnist Earl Wilson as saying: &quot;There are so many misunderstandings in life. I once caused a scandal by saying I lived with two men...I didn&#x27;t mean it in a sexual sense...I was just too dirty to clean my act up. We were just like any people sharing an apartment.&quot; In 2021, Rampling acknowledged the relationship in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, saying:Well, I did have two boyfriends, which was racy at the time...We were all very young. It was all chop and change. Quite a lot of things were experimental, I suppose. How to live a life! I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;ve got it &quot;now&quot;, but never mind – I had it!In 1978, Rampling married French composer Jean-Michel Jarre and had a second son, David Jarre, who became a musician and singer. and then a talented magician. She also raised her stepdaughter, Émilie Jarre, who became a fashion designer. The marriage was publicly dissolved in 1997, when Rampling learned from tabloid stories about Jarre&#x27;s affairs with other women. Their divorce was finalised in 2002. Rampling later remarked:It is not uncommon for a man to have an affair, or even for a woman to have an affair. But the way I found out! In the tabloids. It was demeaning. And then for it to have continued. No, I could not forgive that at the time.Rampling was engaged to Jean-Noël Tassez, a French journalist and businessman, from 1998 until his death in 2015.

Rampling has lived in Paris since the late 1970s.

<doc id="476101" wikidata="Q235854" url="?curid=476101" title="Coat of arms of the Central African Republic">
<text>The coat of arms of the [[Central African Republic]] consists of a shield in the center, with two flags on its edges, and with a sun rising over the shield. Below and above the shield are banners, and there is the badge of the Order of Central African Merit located below the shield as well.

==Symbolism==
&quot;ZO KWE ZO&quot;, the motto in Sango, means &quot;A man is a man&quot; or &quot;All people are people&quot;.

The elephant and the baobab tree represent nature and the backbone of the country. The gold star on a map of Africa symbolizes the position of the Central African Republic. The hand (bottom right quarter) was the symbol of the dominant MESAN party in 1963 when the arms were adopted.
The bottom left quarter holds three diamonds, which symbolize the mineral resources of the country.

The medal under the shield is the honorific decoration of the Order of Central African Merit.

An earlier version of the coat of arms had the words &quot;1er DECEMBRE 1958&quot; written within the sun.

<doc id="476104" wikidata="Q6488195" url="?curid=476104" title="Lapine language">
<text>Lapine is a fictional language created by author Richard Adams for his 1972 novel &quot;Watership Down&quot;, where it is spoken by rabbit characters. The language was again used in Adams&#x27;s 1996 sequel, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot;, and has appeared in both the film and television adaptations. The fragments of language presented by Adams consist of a few dozen distinct words, and are chiefly used for the naming of rabbits, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name &quot;Lapine&quot; comes from the French word for rabbit, &quot;lapin&quot;, and can also be used to describe rabbit society.

==History==
The words of the Lapine language were developed by Adams piecemeal and organically as required by the circumstances of the plot. In a Reddit &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; interview, Adams noted that &quot;I just constructed Lapine as I went—when the rabbits needed a word for something so did I.&quot; Reflecting on his inspirations for the words, Adams stated that &quot;some of them are onomatopoeic like &quot;hrududu&quot; (motor vehicle), but overall they simply came from my subconscious&quot;. Adams commented that the motivation for the sound of Lapine was that it should sound &quot;wuffy, fluffy&quot; as in the word &quot;Efrafa&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Keren Levy described the Lapine language as &quot;somehow easy to accept as [a language] we have always known. It is the language of the countryside, of its copses and beeches and of the weather.&quot;

The sound of Lapine has been ascribed to influence from Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Arabic languages. Author Stephen Cain bolsters the Arabic connection by noting in particular that &quot;Adams had occasion to study [Arabic] during his military service in the Middle East.&quot; The Lapine language has also been frequently compared to Sindarin (the language of the Elves in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Middle-earth&quot; series) in terms of its effect on setting in the novels. Following the success of &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Richard Adams would go on to invent another constructed language for his Beklan novels, &quot;Shardik&quot; (1974) and &quot;Maia&quot; (1984).

==Linguistic analyses==
Some fans of the book, including authors and academics, have written about the words and phrases extant in the corpus of &quot;Watership Down&quot; and have analyzed the language and its variations on a linguistic level.

Within the books, the rabbits&#x27; use of Lapine is presented to readers as Standard English with the inclusion of a number of specialized Lapine lexical terms. Albert Valdman notes that inter-rabbit Lapine is alternately formal and colloquial &quot;marked by hesitations, interruptions, interjections, incomplete sentences, and false starts&quot;. Pit Corder breaks this down further, finding that the Lapine spoken by the rabbits consists of 64% simple sentences, 14% compound sentences (with 30% paratactic and 70% marked coordination), and 22% complex sentences. The mean Lapine sentence length is 6.3 words.

Adams includes a glossary of all Lapine words in the book at the end. Notable traits include the plural marker &quot;-il&quot; (which replaces a final vowel if it is present in the singular: &quot;hrududu&quot;, &quot;automobile&quot;, pl. &quot;hrududil&quot;), and the fact that cardinal numbers only go up to four, with any number above that being called &quot;hrair,&quot; &quot;many&quot;, although the runt Hrairoo&#x27;s name is translated into English as &quot;Fiver&quot; instead. The use of Lapine words is often (although not exclusively) used to indicate concepts unique to rabbits, such as &quot;silflay&quot; (aboveground grazing) or &quot;tharn&quot; (tonic immobility).

When speaking to other animals, the rabbits adopt a lingua franca known as &quot;Hedgerow.&quot; However, in both examples given in the book (i.e. the mouse and Kehaar the gull) the conversation reverts to Lapine once initial contact has been established. More specifically, the rabbits adopt formal Lapine; the other animals employ a Lapine Foreigner Talk that Corder describes as &quot;a reduced code or incipient pidgin&quot;. He further notes that the general rules of &quot;Foreigner Talk&quot; are well-established in societies, even among natives who have never communicated with a foreigner. Corder attributes the learning of the rules of &quot;Foreigner Talk&quot; to its use within native-speaker-oriented literature and other media as a proxy for interlanguage.

Because Lapine is presented in the novels as Standard English, Lapine Foreigner Talk is essentially English Foreigner Talk with a Lapine gloss; thus, it provides an example of linguistic enculturation for children who read the books. Breaking down the syntax of Lapine Foreigner Talk to compare with that of standard Lapine, Corder finds that they are roughly the same with the only notable difference being an inversion of the proportion of paratactic to marked coordination in compound sentences. Specifically, Corder reports Lapine Foreigner Talk to consist of 73% simple sentences, 15% compound sentences (70% paratactic and 30% marked coordination), and 12% complex sentences (with 60% complemented by the four verbs &quot;think&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, and &quot;tell&quot;). Valdman further notes differences between the Lapine Foreigner Talk used to facilitate discussion as with Kehaar the gull, and that used to signal the depreciated status of the unnamed mouse (a less powerful animal in the rabbit world).

==Usage outside the novel==
The use of Lapine outside of the fictional world of the novels has been explored by Thomas E. Murray, who notes that the Lapine word &quot;silflay&quot; (meaning &quot;To go above ground to feed. Literally, to feed outside.&quot;) has entered the English lexicon as more than a mere nonce word. In a survey Murray found that the term was in use (meaning &quot;the act of rabbits eating above-ground&quot;) primarily in the Midwest and North Central United States. He also noted differing levels of use according to socioeconomic status with usage highest among middle and lower middle class speakers. Murray suggests that the geographical spread of the term may in part be limited by interactions with rabbits, highlighting the comment of a New York City-based survey participant who knew the word but never used it due to the lack of rabbits in the city. Murray also claims that the Lapine word &quot;Crixa&quot; (meaning &quot;The center of Efrafa, at the crossing point of two bridle paths&quot;) has also gained usage outside the novel: it is used by students to refer to the residential dormitories within Ohio State University.

Lapine has been described as easy to learn due to its emphasis on nouns, and it has been praised as a didactic tool for budding linguists and learners of English as a second language.

==Linguistic development==
Linguists, academics, and fans of the original novel have further developed and refined the Lapine language since its 1972 creation. Authors, such as Patrick Jemmer (who corresponded briefly with Adams regarding Lapine), have made large-scale &quot;recreations&quot; of various possible historical stages of the language. Jemmer&#x27;s work documents the evolution of numerous inter-related languages (the process of development and analysis is called &quot;aleolinguistics&quot;). It contains comprehensive syntax for each linguistic stage (or &quot;aleostate&quot;), and vocabularies involving approximately 2000 lexemes. Sample scripts and comparative texts are available.

<doc id="476116" wikidata="Q1757673" url="?curid=476116" title="Sobel operator">
<text>The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobel–Feldman operator or Sobel filter, is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges. It is named after Irwin Sobel and Gary M. Feldman, colleagues at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). Sobel and Feldman presented the idea of an &quot;Isotropic 3 × 3 Image Gradient Operator&quot; at a talk at SAIL in 1968. Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Sobel–Feldman operator is either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Sobel–Feldman operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer-valued filter in the horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. On the other hand, the gradient approximation that it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high-frequency variations in the image.

==Formulation==
The operator uses two 3×3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations of the derivatives – one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. If we define A as the source image, and G&quot;x&quot; and G&quot;y&quot; are two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations respectively, the computations are as follows:

:formula_1

where formula_2 here denotes the 2-dimensional signal processing convolution operation.

In his text describing the origin of the operator, Sobel shows different signs for these kernels. He defined the operators as neighborhood masks (i.e. correlation kernels), and therefore are mirrored from what described here as convolution kernels. He also assumed the vertical axis increasing upwards instead of downwards as is common in image processing nowadays, and hence the vertical kernel is flipped.

Since the Sobel kernels can be decomposed as the products of an averaging and a differentiation
kernel, they compute the gradient with smoothing. For example, formula_3 and formula_4 can be written as
:formula_5
The &quot;x&quot;-coordinate is defined here as increasing in the &quot;right&quot;-direction, and the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate is defined as increasing in the &quot;down&quot;-direction. At each point in the image, the resulting gradient approximations can be combined to give the gradient magnitude, using Pythagorean addition:
:formula_6

Using this information, we can also calculate the gradient&#x27;s direction:

:formula_7

where, for example, formula_8 is 0 for a vertical edge which is lighter on the right side (for formula_9 see atan2).

== More formally ==

Since the intensity function of a digital image is only known at discrete points, derivatives of this function cannot be defined unless we assume that there is an underlying differentiable intensity function that has been sampled at the image points. With some additional assumptions, the derivative of the continuous intensity function can be computed as a function on the sampled intensity function, i.e. the digital image. It turns out that the derivatives at any particular point are functions of the intensity values at virtually all image points. However, approximations of these derivative functions can be defined at lesser or larger degrees of accuracy.

The Sobel–Feldman operator represents a rather inaccurate approximation of the image gradient, but is still of sufficient quality to be of practical use in many applications. More precisely, it uses intensity values only in a 3×3 region around each image point to approximate the corresponding image gradient, and it uses only integer values for the coefficients which weight the image intensities to produce the gradient approximation.

== Extension to other dimensions ==
The Sobel–Feldman operator consists of two separable operations:
* Smoothing perpendicular to the derivative direction with a triangle filter: formula_10
* Simple central difference in the derivative direction: formula_11

Sobel–Feldman filters for image derivatives in different dimensions with formula_12 :

1D: formula_13

2D: formula_14

2D: formula_15
3D: formula_16

3D: formula_17

4D: formula_18

Thus as an example the 3D Sobel–Feldman kernel in &quot;z&quot;-direction:

:formula_19

== Technical details ==
As a consequence of its definition, the Sobel operator can be implemented by simple means in both hardware and software: only eight image points around a point are needed to compute the corresponding result and only integer arithmetic is needed to compute the gradient vector approximation. Furthermore, the two discrete filters described above are both separable:

:formula_20
:formula_21

and the two derivatives G&quot;x&quot; and G&quot;y&quot; can therefore be computed as

:formula_22

In certain implementations, this separable computation may be advantageous since it implies fewer arithmetic computations for each image point.

Applying convolution &quot;K&quot; to pixel group &quot;P&quot; can be represented in pseudocode as:

:formula_23

where formula_24 represents the new pixel matrix resulted after applying the convolution &quot;K&quot; to &quot;P&quot;; &quot;P&quot; being the original pixel matrix.

== Example ==

The result of the Sobel–Feldman operator is a 2-dimensional map of the gradient at each point. It can be processed and viewed as though it is itself an image, with the areas of high gradient (the likely edges) visible as white lines. The following images illustrate this, by showing the computation of the Sobel–Feldman operator on a simple image.

The images below illustrate the change in the direction of the gradient on a grayscale circle. When the sign of formula_25 and formula_26 are the same the gradient&#x27;s angle is positive, and negative when different. In the example below the red and yellow colors on the edge of the circle indicate positive angles, and the blue and cyan colors indicate negative angles. The vertical edges on the left and right sides of the circle have an angle of 0 because there is no local change in formula_26. The horizontal edges at the top and bottom sides of the circle have angles of − and respectively because there is no local change in formula_25. The negative angle for top edge signifies the transition is from a bright to dark region, and the positive angle for the bottom edge signifies a transition from a dark to bright region. All other pixels are marked as black due to no local change in either formula_25 or formula_26, and thus the angle is not defined. Since the angle is a function of the ratio of formula_26 to formula_25 pixels with small rates of change can still have a large angle response. As a result noise can have a large angle response which is typically undesired. When using gradient angle information for image processing applications effort should be made to remove image noise to reduce this false response. 

== Alternative operators ==

The Sobel–Feldman operator, while reducing artifacts associated with a pure central differences operator, does not exhibit a good rotational symmetry (about 1° of error). Scharr looked into optimizing this property by producing kernels optimized for specific given numeric precision (integer, float…) and dimensionalities (1D, 2D, 3D). Optimized 3D filter kernels up to a size of 5 x 5 x 5 have been presented there, but the most frequently used, with an error of about 0.2° is:

: formula_33

This factors similarly:

* formula_34

Scharr operators result from an optimization minimizing weighted mean squared angular error in the Fourier domain. This optimization is done under the condition that resulting filters are numerically consistent. Therefore they really are derivative kernels rather than merely keeping symmetry constraints. The optimal 8 bit integer valued 3x3 filter stemming from Scharr&#x27;s theory is
:formula_35

A similar optimization strategy and resulting filters were also presented by Farid and Simoncelli. They also investigate higher-order derivative schemes. In contrast to the work of Scharr, these filters are not enforced to be numerically consistent.

The problem of derivative filter design has been revisited e.g. by Kroon.

Derivative filters based on arbitrary cubic splines were presented by Hast. He showed how first and second order derivatives can be computed correctly using cubic or trigonometric splines by a double filtering approach giving filters of length 7.

Another similar operator that was originally generated from the Sobel operator is the Kayyali operator, a perfect rotational symmetry based convolution filter 3x3.

Orientation-optimal derivative kernels drastically reduce systematic estimation errors in optical flow estimation. Larger schemes with even higher accuracy and optimized filter families for extended optical flow estimation have been presented in subsequent work by Scharr. Second order derivative filter sets have been investigated for transparent motion estimation. It has been observed that the larger the resulting kernels are, the better they approximate derivative-of-Gaussian filters.

== Example comparisons ==
Here, four different gradient operators are used to estimate the magnitude of the gradient of the test image.

<text>The coat of arms of [[Chad]] was adopted in 1970. The center has a shield with jagged blue and yellow lines (&quot;barry dancetty&quot;), with a sun rising over it. The shield is supported by a goat and a lion. Below the shield is a medal and a scroll with the national motto in French, Unité, Travail, Progrès (&quot;Unity, Work, Progress&quot; in English). The shield supporters as well as the scroll feature a red arrow pointing upwards.

==Overview==
The wavy lines on the shield symbolize Lake Chad; the crest, a rising sun, a new beginning for the country. The supporter on the left is a goat, representing the northern half of the state; the southern half is represented by the lion supporting the shield on the right. The insigne of the National Order of Chad (a red Maltese cross centered by a blue disc with golden six-pointed star) depends from the shield.

==Seal==
A separate state emblem of Chad is a black-and-white seal consisting of the words &quot;République du Tchad – Unité, Travail, Progrès&quot; encircling a depiction of the head and upper body of a tribal girl with her hair in cornrows.

NASA&#x27;s Centennial Challenge Program (CCP) directly engages the public at large in the process of advanced technology development that is of value to NASA&#x27;s missions and to the aerospace community. CCP offers challenges set up as competitions that award prize money to the individuals or teams to achieve the specified technology challenge. The prize contests are named &quot;Centennial&quot; in honor of the 100 years since the Wright brothers&#x27; first flight in 1903. The Wright Brothers&#x27; pioneering inventions embody the spirit of the challenges.

The Centennial Challenges are based on a long history of technology prize contests, including the Longitude prize (won by John Harrison), the Orteig Prize (won by Charles Lindbergh), the Ansari X PRIZE (won by Scaled Composites), and the DARPA Grand Challenge (won by Stanford University in 2005 and Carnegie Mellon University in 2007). A key advantage of prizes over traditional grants is that money is only paid when the goal is achieved. A 1999 National Academy of Engineering committee report recommended that &quot;Congress encourage federal agencies to experiment more extensively with inducement prize contests in science and technology&quot;. A 2003 NASA Space Architect study, assisted by the X PRIZE Foundation, led to the establishment of the Centennial Challenges.

As a federal agency, NASA has one of the federal government&#x27;s three largest procurement budgets. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Defense Department (DOD) round out the trio. With the subsequent proposal in Congress of &quot;H Prize&quot; funding for breakthroughs in hydrogen fuel-related technology, the Department of Energy is poised to join NASA and DARPA&#x27;s Defense Department in fortifying this paradigm shift favoring a growing quantity of technology experimenters who might otherwise be neglected by traditional government contractors and federal procurement officials.

==Current challenges==

=== Sample return robot challenge ===

The Sample Return Robot Challenge is to build an autonomous rough-terrain robot which can find and retrieve geologic samples. The intent is to advance autonomic robotics and remote manipulator technology. The prize is US$1.5 million. The Allied Organization selected to partner with NASA to conduct this challenge is Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. Team registration began Summer 2011, and the first competition was held June 16, 2012.

Eleven teams registered for the event, with six showing up to the competition. All but one team were unable to compete after failing the weigh-in and/or inspection. Team SpacePride competed in level one, but did not succeed.

The second running of the challenge took place June 6–8, 2013, at WPI. Ten teams competed for a Level 1 prize. Team Survey of Los Angeles was awarded $5,000 for successfully completing Level 1: their robot left the platform, retrieved a sample and returned to the platform within the 15-minute limit. No teams advanced to Level 2.

The third running of the challenge took place June 9–14, 2014, at WPI. 17 teams competed for Level 1 and Level 2 prizes. Team Mountaineers from West Virginia University (WVU), led by Dr. Yu Gu, successfully completed Level 1 challenge. No teams completed Level 2 challenge in 2014.

The fourth competition took place June 8–12, 2015, at WPI. 16 teams competed for Level 1 and Level 2 prizes. Team Mountaineers from West Virginia University successfully completed Level 2 challenge (with two collected samples or 3 points) and brought home a $100,000 prize. No other team completed Level 1 or Level 2 challenge in 2015.

The fifth year challenge was divided into two events. The Level 1 challenge happened between June 6–11, 2016. Five new teams completed Level 1. The final Level 2 challenge was performed on Sep. 4 &amp; 5. Team Mountaineers from West Virginia University collected 5 samples with a total score of 11 points, and won the challenge with a $750,000 prize.

Efforts were coordinated by NASA and the WPI Robotics Center.

===Mars Ascent Vehicle Prize===

The MAV Prize is a challenge to demonstrate technologies that may be relevant to future NASA Science Mission Directorate Mars missions. The competition will mimic a MAV mission. When NASA eventually returns samples from Mars, there will be a requirement for a special rocket system — the MAV — to launch the samples from Mars’ surface into orbit for rendezvous with a spacecraft that will return them to Earth.
The MAV Challenge requires highly reliable and autonomous sample insertion into the rocket, launch from the surface, and deployment of the sample container. Innovative technology from this competition may be considered in future planning for a Mars exploration mission.
The first-place award is $25,000; second-place is $15,000; and third-place is $10,000. Competing teams will be eligible for prize money only after the successful completion of all the required tasks.

The inaugural competition was held in April 2015. North Carolina State University of Raleigh won $25,000 for first place; Tarleton State University of Stephenville, Texas, won second, winning $15,000. There was no third-place winner.

===Cube Quest Challenge===

The Cube Quest Challenge offers a prize purse of $5 million to teams that meet the challenge objectives of designing, building and delivering flight-qualified, small satellites capable of advanced operations near and beyond the moon. Cube Quest teams will have the opportunity to compete for a secondary payload spot on the first mission of NASA&#x27;s Orion spacecraft, which will launch atop the agency&#x27;s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.
The competition includes three stages: Ground Tournaments, Deep Space Derby, and Lunar Derby. The Ground Tournaments will be held every four to six months, leading to an opportunity to earn a spot on the first integrated flight of Orion and SLS. The Deep Space Derby will focus on finding innovative solutions to deep space communications using small spacecraft, and the Lunar Derby will focus primarily on propulsion for small spacecraft and near-Earth communications.

==Completed challenges==

===Green Flight Challenge===
The Green Flight Challenge sponsored by Google is to build an aircraft which can fly 200 miles in under two hours using the energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline per passenger. The US$1,650,000 prize was competed for Sept 25 - Oct 1, 2011 at the Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport, Santa Rosa, California. The CAFE Foundation was the Allied Organization which partnered with NASA&#x27;s Centennial Challenges Program to conduct the challenge. On October 1, 2011, CAFE had a competition open house for the public to see the aircraft and meet the competing teams. The Google Green Flight Challenge Exposition was at NASA Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California on October 3, 2011. Free admission tickets were available at the Expo website. The Expo had the competition aircraft on display, presented winner checks and additional displays of green energy technology.

===Strong tether challenge===
This competition presented the challenge of constructing super-strong tethers, a crucial component of a space elevator. The 2005 contest was to award US$50,000 to the team which constructed the strongest tether, with contests in future years requiring that each winner outperform that of the previous year by 50%. No competing tether surpassed the commercial off-the-shelf baseline and the prize was increased to US$200,000 in 2006.

In 2007 the prize money was raised to US$500,000 USD for this competition.

The 2011 Strong Tether Centennial Challenge was held at the Space Elevator Conference in Redmond, Washington on August 12, 2011. The Space Elevator Conference, sponsored by Microsoft, The Leeward Space Foundation and The International Space Elevator Consortium has hosted the Tether competition for five years and there has yet to be a winner.

===Power beam challenge===
Power Beam competitions were held in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. They were directed at space elevator applications. Teams built mechanical devices (climbers) that could propel themselves up a vertical cable. The power supply for the device was not self-contained but remained on the ground. The technical challenge was to transmit the power to the climber and transform it into mechanical motion, efficiently and reliably.

This was a competition to build a wirelessly-powered ribbon-climbing robot. The contest involves having the robot lift a large payload within a limited timeframe. The first competition in 2005 would have awarded US$50,000, US$20,000, and US$10,000 to the three best-performing teams, meeting the minimum benchmark of 1 m/s. However, no team met this standard, with only two teams climbing under beam power. This prize also increased to US$200,000 in 2006, but no team was able to accomplish the full set of requirements. See for more information on Power Beam Challenge as well as other challenges related to space elevator technologies.

In 2007 the prize money was raised to US$500,000 USD for this competition.

In the 2009 competition, the competitors drove their laser-powered devices up a cable one kilometer high, suspended from a helicopter. LaserMotive LLC was awarded US$900,000 in the 2009 Power Beaming Challenge.

=== Moon regolith Oxygen (MoonROx) challenge ===
This head-to-head competition was for a system capable of extracting 2.5 kilograms of oxygen from 100 kilograms of artificial lunar regolith in 4 hours or less using at most 10 kW of power. This US$1 million prize expired in June 2009 without a winner.

The initial MoonROx challenge was announced in 2005 with the intent to award a US$250,000 prize to the first team to develop the capability to extract 5 kilograms of breathable oxygen from simulated lunar soil in an eight-hour period. The prize expired in June 2008.

For the initial announcement of the challenge, the competition was to be administered by the Florida Space Research Institute (FSRI) in collaboration with NASA.
The next year the California Space Education and Workforce Institute (CSEWI) was selected to administer the challenge when FSRI was dissolved and Space Florida was created to take its place.

Since extracting oxygen from silicates is difficult, and the oxygen electrochemically bound into the silicates at high temperature, it is likely that a solar-furnace may be part of the solution.

=== Astronaut glove challenge ===

In the 2007 competition, only the pressure-restraining layer part of the glove was required. But for the 2009 challenge, teams had to provide a complete glove, including the outer, thermal-micrometeoroid-protection layer. This competition rewarded US$200,000 in May 2007 to the team which constructed the best-performing astronaut glove.

The first competition took place May 2 and May 3, 2007, at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. NASA offered a total of US$200,000 for the team that could design and manufacture the best astronaut glove that exceeded minimum requirements. An additional US$50,000 was offered to the team that best demonstrated Mechanical Counter Pressure gloves
. The US$200,000 prize was awarded to Peter K. Homer, an engineer from Southwest Harbor, Maine; the US$50,000 prize went unclaimed and rolled to the next competition.

The 2009 competition was held on November 18 and 19 at the Astronaut Hall of Fame in Titusville, Florida. In the 2009 competition Peter K. Homer of Maine won US$250,000 and Ted Southern of New York won US$100,000, both had competed previously. Another challenge is planned and the date is yet to be announced.

=== Vertical and lunar lander challenges ===
Also announced at the XPrize Cup Expo and run by the XPrize Foundation, this prize is for a VTVL (vertical take-off, vertical landing) suborbital rocket that can achieve the altitudes and launch energies that are equivalent to what would be needed for a lunar lander. The Vertical Lander Challenge requires 50 meter minimum altitude, horizontal distance of 100 meters, flight time of 90 seconds, and landing on a smooth surface and after refueling, return to its original location. The more aggressive Lunar Lander Challenge increases that to 180s of flight time and landing on a rocky surface. The VLC has a first prize of $350,000, while the LLC has a first prize in excess of this. For 2006 at the Wirefly X PRIZE Cup, Armadillo Aerospace was the only team able to compete. Their vehicle &quot;Pixel&quot; completed one leg of the trip on its third try but crashed shortly after takeoff on the return, leaving all prizes unclaimed.

In 2008, Armadillo Aerospace successfully completed the easier level one VLC prize.

In 2009, the level two first prize was won by Masten Space Systems, while Armadillo Aerospace took the level two second prize.

===Regolith excavation challenge===
In this Challenge, teams designed and built robotic machines to excavate simulated lunar soil (regolith). The Challenge was managed by the California Space Authority and was competed in 2007, 2008, and 2009, at which time the Challenge was won by a team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, which won the US$500,000 prize purse.

===Night rover challenge===
The Night Rover Challenge is to build a solar-powered robot which can operate on stored energy for a significant portion of time. The intent is to spur development of extreme environment battery technology for use in space missions. The prize is US$1.5 million. NASA is partnered with nonprofit organization Clean Tech Open for this challenge . Requirements for proposal submission are here.

As of October 2013, the Night Rover Challenge was closed as no competitors registered.

===Unmanned aircraft systems airspace operations challenge===
In October 2012 NASA announced a challenge with the goal of developing some of the key technologies that will make it possible to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into the National Airspace System. The challenge&#x27;s focus was on demonstrating a high level of operational robustness and the ability to &quot;sense and avoid&quot; other air traffic.

The challenge was to have been divided into two parts: Phase 1 was scheduled to be held in Spring 2014, and Phase 2 would have taken place one year after Phase 1 was successfully completed. The total prize money available in Phase 1 was US$500,000. Phase 2 was planned to have US$1 million in prize money.

In May 2013, NASA announced that it had selected Development Projects Inc. of Dayton, Ohio to manage the challenge.

As of November 2014, NASA has cancelled the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Airspace Operations Challenge (AOC) due to unanticipated technical and operational issues as well as additional costs. NASA Centennial Challenges have historically been high-risk and leveraged activities conducted with minimal government funding. NASA reviewed the intended outcomes of the AOC and determined that the competition was no longer timely or cost-effective to execute as planned. NASA&#x27;s cancellation of the AOC was not based in any way on technical progress or performance of the registered teams.

===CO2 conversion challenge===
The CO2 conversion challenge is a competition to convert carbon dioxide into sugars to be used as feedstock for biomanufacturing in space and on Mars. The competition began in 2018 to incentivize the public to recreate the process plants do regularly, except with a non-biological system. Five teams were each awarded a $50,000 milestone prize in 2019 for Phase 1 of the competition to design a system that could accomplish the chemical transformation, including teams from University of California, Princeton University, Rutgers University, Air Company, and Dioxide Materials. Phase 2 of the competition ended in 2021, and three teams split a $750,000 prize purse.

<doc id="476124" wikidata="Q233996" url="?curid=476124" title="Coat of arms of Chile">
<text>The coat of arms of Chile dates from 1834 and was designed by the English artist Charles Wood Taylor (1792–1856). It is made up by a figurative background divided in two equal parts: the top one is blue and the bottom, red. A five pointed white star is in the centre of the shield. This background is supported in one side by an Andean condor, the most significant bird of prey from the Andes, and in the other, by a huemul, a mammal endemic to Chile. Both animals wear golden naval crowns symbolising the heroic deeds of the Chilean Navy in the Pacific Ocean.

The coat of arms is crowned by a three-feathered crest, each feather bearing one colour: blue, white and red. This crest was a symbol of distinction that former presidents of the Republic used to wear on their hats.

Underneath the coat of arms and on the elaborated pedestal, there is a white band with the motto: &quot;Por la Razón o la Fuerza&quot; (&quot;By reason or force&quot;).

This emblem is the last of a series of variations due to diverse circumstances and understandings.

==Official description==
Under Decreto Supremo Nº 1534 del Ministerio del Interior de Chile, sobre el uso de los Emblemas Nacionales, Chilean law describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The Coat of Arms presents a five-pointed silver star in the center of a cut field, turquoise blue the top and red the bottom and its shape is that fixed by the official model approved by War Decree No. 2,271 of September 4, 1920, in accordance with the law, and which, in addition, has a timbre a tricolor plumage of turquoise blue, white and red; for supports a rampant huemulum on its right and a condor on its left in the position that fixes that model, crowned each of these animals with a gold naval crown; and on the base an arcocola crossed by a ribbon with the slogan &quot;For reason or strength&quot;, all in accordance with the aforementioned model.&quot;

== History ==
=== The first coat of arms ===

The first coat of arms was created during the office of President José Miguel Carrera, in 1812. It was designed over an oval in which center was depicted a column representing the Tree of Freedom. On top of this column was a terrestrial globe; over the globe, a lance and a palm leaf crossed and over these two, a star.

Standing, on both sides of the fixture, was the figure of an indigenous woman and a man. On top of everything was written, in Latin, &quot;Post Tenebras Lux&quot; (&quot;After the Darkness, Light&quot;) and at the bottom, &quot;Aut Consilio Aut Ense&quot; (&quot;By Council or by Sword&quot;).

This emblem, like the first Chilean flag, was initially exclusively for army use. In Chile, the Spanish emblems were still used at the time of the Chilean War of Independence. When the Spanish army arrived in Chile in 1813, with the goal of reconquering the country, the first independent emblems were adopted as national symbols.

There are no original representations of this first coat of arms, so its design is open to interpretation. One of the few sources is a description made in the &quot;Memoria histórica sobre la Revolución de Chile&quot; by Melchor Martínez. Although the version with supporters is the most accepted representation of the coat, other historians have suggested that the coat of arms was oval-shaped, and had also a reverse depicting a sun rising behind mountain with the mottoes &quot;Aurora libertatis chilensis&quot; (&quot;The beginning of Chilean liberty&quot;) and &quot;Umbra et nocti, lux et libertas succedunt&quot; (&quot;Shadow and night are succeeded by light and liberty&quot;).

In 1817, two new coats of arms emerged. The first one, created in June, showed a similar pillar and globe, and the motto &quot;Libertad&quot; (&quot;Liberty&quot;) over them, together with the words &quot;Unión y fuerza&quot; (&quot;Union and strength&quot;) on a black blue field.

=== Transitory coat of arms ===

Two years later, on 23 September 1819, a new project for a coat of arms was approved in the Senate. It was a dark blue field, with a column standing on a white marble pedestal in the middle. On top of this column, the new American world with the word &quot;Libertad&quot; (&quot;Liberty&quot;) over it. Above this sign, a five-pointed star, representing the province of Santiago. Two similar stars, representing Concepción and Coquimbo, were at each side of the column.

This combination of elements was surrounded by two small branches of laurel with their buds tied with a tricolor ribbon. Around this ribbon, the whole armory of the country was depicted in strict order: cavalry, infantry, dragoons, artillery and bombardiers.

To complete the coat of arms, an indigenous man held it with his hands over his head, while sitting on an American cayman with one foot resting on the Horn of Plenty. The cayman had, in its jaws, the Lion of Castile, whose crown laid fallen on one side and was holding the ripped Spanish flag with its front paws.

This coat of arms was used until 1834, when it was replaced with another one very similar to the current one.

=== The current coat of arms ===

In 1832, Joaquín Prieto commissioned the creation of a permanent coat of arms for the Republic. Charles Chatworthy Wood Taylor, an English artist, was designer of the coat that included a field party per fess, blue and red, with a condor and a huemul for supporters and three feathers with the national colors of Chile, that symbolized the feathers that the President and Supreme Director used on their hats as a symbol of power.

In 1920, the motto &quot;Por la razón o la fuerza&quot; was added to the coat of arms.

<text>The Roberts cross operator is used in image processing and computer vision for edge detection. It was one of the first edge detectors and was initially proposed by Lawrence Roberts in 1963. As a differential operator, the idea behind the Roberts cross operator is to approximate the gradient of an image through discrete differentiation which is achieved by computing the sum of the squares of the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. 

==Motivation==
According to Roberts, an edge detector should have the following properties: the produced edges should be well-defined, the background should contribute as little noise as possible, and the intensity of edges should correspond as close as possible to what a human would perceive. With these criteria in mind and based on then prevailing psychophysical theory Roberts proposed the following equations:

:formula_1

:formula_2

where x is the initial intensity value in the image, z is the computed derivative and i,j represent the location in the image.

The results of this operation will highlight changes in intensity in a diagonal direction. One of the most appealing aspects of this operation is its simplicity; the kernel is small and contains only integers. However with the speed of computers today this advantage is negligible and the Roberts cross suffers greatly from sensitivity to noise.

==Formulation==
In order to perform edge detection with the Roberts operator we first convolve the original image, with the following two kernels: 

:formula_3

Let formula_4 be a point in the original image and formula_5 be a point in an image formed by convolving with the first kernel and formula_6 be a point in an image formed by convolving with the second kernel. The gradient can then be defined as:

:formula_7

The direction of the gradient can also be defined as follows:

:formula_8
Note that angle of 0° corresponds to a vertical orientation such that the direction of maximum contrast from black to white runs from left to right on the image.

== Example comparisons == 
Here, four different gradient operators are used to estimate the magnitude of the gradient of the test image.

<text>The National Emblem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a national symbol of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and contains in a red circle a representation of Tiananmen Gate, the entrance gate to the Forbidden City imperial palace complex, where Mao Zedong declared the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. Above this representation are the five stars found on the national flag. The largest star represents the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), while the four smaller stars represent the four revolutionary social classes as defined in Maoism. The emblem is described as being &quot;composed of patterns of the national flag&quot;: 

...The red color of the flag symbolizes revolution and the yellow color of the stars the golden brilliant rays radiating from the vast red land. The design of four smaller stars surrounding a bigger one signifies the unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).

—China Yearbook 2004
The outer border of the red circle shows sheaves of wheat and the inner sheaves of rice, which together represent agricultural workers. At the center of the bottom portion of the border is a cog-wheel that represents industrial workers.

According to &quot;The Description of the National Emblem of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; (), these elements taken together symbolise the revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people since the May Fourth Movement and the coalition of the proletariat which succeeded in founding the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== History ==
===Beiyang period===

The Empire of China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty did not have an official state emblem, but the flag featured the azure dragon on a plain yellow field with a red sun of the three-legged crow in the upper left corner. It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the Yellow Dragon Flag.

Following the end of Manchu rule, new national symbols were deemed necessary by the leaders to represent the changed circumstances. The renowned writers Lu Xun, Qian Daosun, and Xu Shoushang from the Ministry of Education were tasked with designing a new national emblem. It was presented on August 28, 1912, and was adopted as national emblem in February 1913. President-Emperor Yuan Shikai continued its use during his short imperial reign from 1915 to 1916. The emblem is based on the ancient symbols of the Twelve Ornaments. These are first mentioned as already ancient in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; by Emperor Shun, who was one of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Oral tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 and 2184 BC. According to the book, the emperor wished for the symbols to be used on official robes of the state.

===Nationalist period===
The Northern Expedition led by Generallissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang party led to the overthrow of the fractious yet internationally recognized Beiyang government in 1928. This ushered in a one-party state under the Kuomintang known as the Nanjing decade. The state emblem was therefore replaced with the Kuomintang Blue Sky with a White Sun party symbol. The &quot;Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth&quot; flag has remained the flag of the Republic of China to this day. During this period, under the KMT&#x27;s political tutelage, the Blue Sky with a White Sun Flag shared the same prominence as the ROC flag. A common wall display consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of National Father Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. After the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the party flag was removed from such a display and the national flag was moved to the center.

Since the ROC government moved to Taiwan and especially in the years since the end of martial law the Kuomintang flag has lost some of its prominence. However, it is still frequently seen on KMT party buildings in political rallies and other meetings of KMT and the pan-blue coalition.

===Communist period===

The first communist government in China known as the Chinese Soviet Republic had the emblem adopted in 1934. It consisted of a hammer and sickle on a globe, and the grain ears are placed under and on both sides of the earth. Above the earth and the five-pointed star is written the &quot;Chinese Soviet Republic&quot; on the top, and the &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot; written on the bottom.

On July 10, 1949, the government held a public competition for the design of the national emblem, however no satisfactory designs were selected. Therefore, on September 27, 1949, the First Plenary Session of Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference decided to invite designers for the proposals of the national emblem and two groups from two universities were selected in September 1949. Three proposals were selected for the first round discussion:

*The designers from China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Zhang Ding, Zhang Guangyu, Zhou Lingzhao and Zhong Ling, handed out their proposals with 5 variations on September 25, 1949. The symbolism of their first design was: The red star symbolizes Communism and the CCP. The cog and wheat/rice symbolizes unification of industrial workers and peasants. The rising earth with China in red symbolizes the socialist revolution in China and the world revolution ideal on Asian counties. 31 rays behind the earth symbolizes the 31 provincial administrative divisions at that time. The name of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is written on the red ribbon below. The design was based on their design of the emblem of Charter of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, and was influenced by Socialist heraldry of the Eastern Bloc.
*The designers from the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, Mo Zongjiang, Zhu Changzhong, Li Zongjin and Gao Zhuang, handed their proposal on October 30, 1949. According to their proposal, the design was a mixture of traditional Chinese culture and Maoist New Democratic Revolution ideals. The design imitated the style of mirrors in Han dynasty, symbolizing brightness. The disc was made of jade, a symbol of peace and unity. Decorative carvings on the disc was in Tang dynasty style. The stars from national flag and a cog were placed in the center of the disc, surrounded by wheats, symbolizing unity of working class and socialism. The red ribbon tied a smaller jade ring, symbolising the unification of Chinese people.
*The other proposal by Zhang Ding, Zhang Guangyu, Zhou Lingzhao, was a perspective depiction of Tian&#x27;anmen gate.

Members of the first Charter of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference committee discussed these three proposals on June 10, 1950. The result of the discussion was, the China Central Academy of Fine Arts proposal was too colourful to be regarded as trademarks, and proposal from Tsinghua University was regarded as bourgeois due to its use of traditional symbols. The committee suggested the groups include the Tian&#x27;anmen Gate, a symbol of Chinese revolution that served as the location of the May Fourth Movement and foundation ceremony of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.

The two groups then worked on a second round of proposals. The second round proposals from Tsinghua University were based on standardized design of the Tian&#x27;anmen Gate on the emblem and red and yellow were chosen as the main colours.

At the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference committee meeting on June 15, proposals from Tsinghua University were chosen and the committee suggested &quot;Combine the design of No.1 and No.3. with outer ring of No.1 and content of No.3&quot;.

Tsinghua University presented their new design and their proposal was selected and officially made the national emblem on 20 September 1950 by the Central People&#x27;s Government. The selected design was further standardized and simplified by Gao Zhuang and was confirmed on August 18, 1950.

==Construction==

National standard of China: GB 15093-2008 specifies the construction, material and color of the national emblem.

== Emblems of subdivisions ==
Before the Communist takeover of Mainland China, the ROC had provinces design their own emblems. Only two emblems were used so far.

On April 15, 1985, Taiyuan City officially announced its emblem, becoming the first city in the People&#x27;s Republic of China to have a city emblem.

Hong Kong and Macao each have their own emblem. The National People&#x27;s Congress have passed the standardized use of the two special administrative regions&#x27; emblems.

Under Chinese law since November 1997, only Hong Kong and Macau are allowed to have their own emblems and other localities that had them had to stop using theirs. This rule was ignored in 2011 when the city of Chengdu chose the Golden Sun Bird found under the city&#x27;s Jinsha site as its emblem.

==After politics==
Lewis was the former executive director of the Centre for Women in Business at Mount Saint Vincent University. She was principal of both the Institute of Technology and Akerley Campuses of the Nova Scotia Community College. In 2001 she became the first African Canadian senior administrator in the history of the college.

She was on the executive of the Vanier Institute of the Family and the Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts. She was a member of the International Women&#x27;s Foundation.

She died in a Halifax hospital in 2013.

<doc id="476142" wikidata="Q235826" url="?curid=476142" title="Coat of arms of Colombia">
<text>The coat of arms of Colombia contains a shield with numerous symbols. Perched on top of the shield is an Andean condor holding an olive crown and the condor symbolizing freedom. The national motto, &quot;Libertad y Orden&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Liberty and Order&quot;), is on a scroll in between the bird and the shield in black font over golden background. The condor is depicted as displayed (with his wings extended) and looking to the right.

==Description==
The national flag is draped on each side of the shield. The shield is broken into three portions. In the lowermost portion is a depiction of ships, pointing to the maritime history of Colombia, mainly to the Isthmus of Panama, which was part of Colombia until 1903. Nowadays represents the two oceans that border the country (Atlantic and Pacific). The sails mean the Colombian commerce with the rest of the world and the rising economy. In the middle section, over a field of silver (argent), the Phrygian cap is presented; this being a traditional symbol of liberty and freedom. The topmost section contains a pomegranate over a blue (azure) field, as a symbol of the Vice royalty of New Granada (early colonial name of Colombia back in the 18th century), in the middle flanked by two &quot;cornucopias&quot; or horns of plenty: the one at the right with golden and silver coins and the one at the left with tropical fruits. This portion represents the agricultural and mineral wealth of Colombian soil.

The coat of arms of the Republic was designed by Francisco de Paula Santander, and was adopted via Act 3 of 9 May 1834, with later non-essential modifications according to Ordinance 861 of 1924.

<text>Ohrdruf was a German forced labor and concentration camp located near Ohrdruf, south of Gotha, in Thuringia, Germany. It was part of the Buchenwald concentration camp network.

==Operation==
Created in November 1944 near the town of Ohrdruf, south of Gotha, in Thuringia, Germany, Ohrdruf was initially a separate forced labour camp directly controlled by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WVHA) but then became a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar. It made use of huts originally built in 1940 for Wehrmacht troops using the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz&quot; nearby as well as other facilities. The camp, code-named &quot;Außenlager S III&quot;, consisted of a northern and a southern camp; later, a tent camp at Espenfeld and a camp at Crawinkel were added. The camp supplied forced labor in the form of concentration camp prisoners for a planned railway construction project for an immense communications center inside the basement of the Mühlberg castle in Ohrdruf. Inmates had to work to connect the castle to the main railroad line and to dig tunnels in the nearby mountains, which would be used as emergency shelter for the train that contained the &quot;Führerhauptquartier&quot;. The proposed communication centre was never completed due to the rapid American advance.

By late 1944, around 10,000 prisoners were housed here; through March 1945, the total number sent here was around 20,000, mainly Russians, Poles, Hungarian Jews, some French, Czechs, Italians, Belgians, Greeks, Yugoslavians and Germans. Conditions were atrocious: in the huts there were no beds, &quot;only blood-covered straw and lice&quot;. Despite the season, not all prisoners were housed in huts—some were accommodated in stables, tents and old bunkers. Work days were initially 10 to 11 hours long, then later 14 hours, involving strenuous physical labor building roads, railways and tunnels. In addition, inmates had to cope with long marches and musterings, total lack of sanitary equipment and medical facilities, and insufficient food and clothing.

In January 1945, the SS guards were reinforced by units from Auschwitz. Towards the end of the war, the prisoners were used to construct a subterranean headquarters for the government (&quot;Führerhauptquartier&quot;) to be used following a possible evacuation of Berlin. It was never completed.

It is still not clear exactly what projects the prisoners of Ohrdruf were working on. Besides the temporary quarters for the &quot;Reich&quot; leadership, the extensive tunneling and other works at Jonastal point to an armament factory of some kind. There is a theory, advanced by Rainer Karlsch that the facility was intended as (and used as) a testing site for a German nuclear bomb. Other possibilities are an improved V-2 rocket or long-range jet-powered bombers, but all of this is speculative.

Those unable to work were moved by the SS to &quot;Sterbelager&quot;: 4,300 sick inmates were moved to Bergen-Belsen, or the &quot;Kleines Lager&quot; at Buchenwald. In late March 1945, the camp had a prisoner population of some 11,700 to 13,000. As the American troops advanced towards Ohrdruf, the SS began evacuating almost all prisoners on death marches to Buchenwald on April 1. During these marches, SS, Volkssturm, and members of the Hitler Youth killed an estimated 1,000 prisoners. Mass graves were re-opened and SS men tried to burn the corpses. The SS guards killed many of the remaining prisoners in the &quot;Nordlager&quot; that were deemed too ill to walk to the railcars. After luring them to the parade ground, claiming that they were to be fed, the SS shot them and left their corpses lying in the open.

In addition to those killed on the death marches, an estimated 3,000 inmates died from exhaustion or were murdered inside the camp. Together with those worked to death here but moved elsewhere to die, estimates of the total number of victims are around 7,000.

==Liberation==
Ohrdruf was liberated on April 4, 1945, by the 4th Armored Division, led by Brigadier General Joseph F. H. Cutrona, and the 89th Infantry Division. It was the first Nazi concentration camp liberated by the U.S. Army.

When the soldiers of the 4th Armored Division entered the camp, they discovered piles of bodies, some covered with lime, and others partially incinerated on pyres. The ghastly nature of their discovery led General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, to visit the camp on April 12, with Generals George S. Patton and Omar Bradley. After his visit, Eisenhower cabled General George C. Marshall, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, describing his trip to Ohrdruf:

... the most interesting—although horrible—sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to &#x27;propaganda.&#x27;

At Ohrdruf concentration camp, 4th Armored Division soldier David Cohen said: &quot;We walked into a shed and the bodies were piled up like wood. There are no words to describe it.&quot; He said the smell was overpowering and unforgettable.

Seeing the Nazi crimes committed at Ohrdruf made a powerful impact on Eisenhower, and he wanted the world to know what happened in the concentration camps. On April 19, 1945, he again cabled Marshall with a request to bring members of Congress and journalists to the newly liberated camps so that they could bring the horrible truth about German Nazi atrocities to the American public. That same day, Marshall received permission from the Secretary of War, Henry Lewis Stimson, and President Harry S. Truman for these delegations to visit the liberated camps.

Ohrdruf had also made a powerful impression on Patton, who described it as &quot;one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen.&quot; He recounted in his diary that:

In a shed ... was a pile of about 40 completely naked human bodies in the last stages of emaciation. These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench.

When the shed was full—I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January.

When we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them. They were not very successful in their operations because there was a pile of human bones, skulls, charred torsos on or under the griddle which must have accounted for many hundreds.

==Later use==
The military training area of &quot;Truppenübungsplatz Ohrdruf&quot; was then taken over in July 1945 by the Red Army, since Thuringia became part of the Soviet occupation zone. The &quot;Nordlager&quot; was razed. Two memorials to the dead were erected at around this time. Since 1993, the Bundeswehr has been in charge of the area.

Today, the only structures remaining from the camp period are some of the munition bunkers that were also used to house prisoners.

==Media coverage==
*&quot;Frontline&quot;: &quot;Memory of the Camps&quot; (May 7, 1985, Season 3, Episode 18), is a 56-minute television documentary that addresses Ohrdruf and other Nazi concentration camps
*In 2015 the first reports of the systematic genocide was the subject of the short documentary &quot;Ralph Rush: Concentration Camp Liberator&quot; directed by Daniel L. Bernardi with the collaboration of El Dorado Films and the Veteran Documentary Corps.

<doc id="476147" wikidata="Q209213" url="?curid=476147" title="Emblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">
<text>The [[national emblem]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] has changed several times since 1997. The current one was introduced in 2006 and depicts a leopard head, surrounded by an elephant tusk to the left and a spear to the right. Below are the three words which make up the national motto: &quot;Justice, Paix, Travail&quot; (&quot;Justice, Peace, Work&quot; in French). It was adopted on 18 February 2006 by President Joseph Kabila.

The arms are described in detail in Section 1, Article 1 of the 2005 constitution.

The old emblem, which was introduced in 2003, depicted three interlocked hands surrounded by two laurel branches. At the top is a lion head and at the bottom the motto &quot;Démocratie, Justice, Unité&quot; (&quot;Democracy, Justice, Unity&quot; in French).

The coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1999 consists of a light blue shield. In the middle is a yellow star, above which there are six smaller stars. This coat of arms was introduced along with the flag.

An even older arms from 1971 to 1997, when the nation was known as Zaire, depicted a leopard head, below it a pair of crossed spears, around it a branch and an elephant tusk. The words &quot;Paix, Justice, Travail&quot; are written on a white band under the spears. This device was officially introduced on 1 August 1964.

<text>Apple Developer (formerly Apple Developer Connection) is Apple Inc.&#x27;s website for software development tools, application programming interfaces (APIs), and technical resources. It contains resources to help software developers write software for the macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS platforms. 

The applications are created in Xcode, or sometimes using other supported 3rd party programs. The apps can then be submitted to App Store Connect (formerly iTunes Connect), another one of Apple&#x27;s website for approval the internal review team. Once approved, they can be distributed publicly via the respective app stores, i.e. App Store (iOS) for iOS and iPadOS apps, iMessage app store for Messages apps and Sticker pack apps, App Store (tvOS) for Apple TV apps, watchOS app store for Apple Watch apps with watchOS 6 and later, and via App Store (iOS) for earlier versions of watchOS. macOS apps are a notable exception to this, as they can be distributed similarly via Apple&#x27;s Mac App Store or independently on the World Wide Web.

== Programs ==

=== Mac ===
The Mac developer program is a way for developers of Apple&#x27;s macOS operating system to distribute their apps through the Mac App Store. It costs US$99/year. Unlike iOS, developers are not required to sign up for the program in order to distribute their applications. Mac applications can freely be distributed via the developer&#x27;s website and/or any other method of distribution excluding the Mac App Store. The Mac Developer Program also provides developers with resources to help them distribute their Mac applications.

==Software leaks==
There have been several leaks of secret Apple software through the prerelease program, most notably the Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger leaks, in which Apple sued three men who allegedly obtained advance copies of Mac OS X 10.4 prerelease builds from the site and leaked it to BitTorrent.

==Attempted hacks==
On July 18, 2013, an intruder attempted to access sensitive personal information on Apple&#x27;s developer servers. The information was encrypted, but Apple could not guarantee that some information about developers may have been accessed. The Developer website was taken down for &quot;maintenance&quot; that Thursday, and was said to be undergoing maintenance through Sunday, when Apple posted a notice on the site notifying users of the attempted hack. They have stated that they will be rebuilding their servers and the developer system to prevent this from happening in the future.

==Developer tutorials and tools==
Apple provides free tutorials and guide support for their developer program.

In the beginning of July 2023, Apple finished construction on their Developer Center in Cupertino, California. During special events, developers are able to visit the center for one-on-one’s with Apple employees, demos of upcoming software, and more.

== Apple Security Research Device Program ==
The Security Research Device (SRD) is a specially fused iPhone that allows users to perform iOS security research without having to bypass its security features. Even though shell access is available, users can run any tools, choose their own entitlements, and customize the kernel. With the SRD, users can confidently report all their findings to Apple without the risk of losing access to the inner layers of iOS security. Any vulnerabilities users discover with the SRD are automatically considered for Apple Security Bounty.
The SRD program is available in many countries, such as Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

<doc id="476150" wikidata="Q3033745" url="?curid=476150" title="Dogcow">
<text>The dogcow, named Clarus, is a bitmapped image designed by Apple for the demonstration of page layout in the classic Mac OS. The sound it makes is &quot;Moof!&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;moo&quot; and &quot;woof&quot;. Clarus became the archetype of surrealistic humor in the corporate culture of the original Macintosh group, particularly as the mascot of Apple’s Developer Technical Support as officially documented in Technote #31.

==History==
In 1983, the dog icon had been created by Susan Kare as the glyph for &quot;z&quot;, as part of the &quot;Cairo&quot; font. Later, when redesigning the classic Mac OS &quot;Page Setup&quot; print dialog box for the LaserWriter, an example image was required. According to HCI engineer Annette Wagner,

The new dog graphic had a more bovine look.

On October 15, 1987, the term &quot;dogcow&quot; was coined by Scott Zimmerman. She was later named Clarus by Mark &quot;The Red&quot; Harlan, as a joking reference to Claris, Apple&#x27;s business unit for office software at the time.

The Clarus icon became one of the giant pieces of pixel art in the Icon Garden in the front yard of the Apple Campus at 1 Infinite Loop; the Icon Garden has since been removed.

Apple&#x27;s &quot;Developer CD Series&quot; of the 1980s features a dogcow logo on the discs.

The latest references to the dogcow came in the documentation for the Swift programming language, which uses the word &quot;dogcow&quot; as an example of the use of Unicode characters to name constants and variables; and in a sticker pack in Messages.
In the first beta of macOS Ventura, the dogcow returned to the page setup window, and in iOS 16 entering &#x27;Clarus&#x27; or &#x27;Moof&#x27; results in the keyboard suggesting the &#x27;dog&#x27; and &#x27;cow&#x27; Emoji.

==Overview==

The sound she makes is &quot;Moof!&quot;, and in early versions of Apple Developer CDs one section was known as &quot;Moof!&quot;.

The dogcow symbol and &quot;Moof!&quot; were proprietary trademarks of Apple until the registration was cancelled in 1999.

==Reception==
The disappearance of the Icon Garden and of Clarus from Apple&#x27;s products is seen by &quot;MacWorld&quot; as a symbol of the draining of culture and character from, and an increase in blankness and austerity in, Apple&#x27;s products over the years. In a 2015 retrospective, the magazine said Clarus &quot;came into being through quirkiness and serendipity, and you could say it has no business in a grown-up, commercial operating system. It makes no real sense, and wasn’t really there on merit or through strategic planning&quot; and represented a company that was &quot;kooky&quot;, &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;, and not dominated by rules.

<doc id="476159" wikidata="Q3097958" url="?curid=476159" title="Janet Lee Bouvier">
<text>Janet Norton Lee Auchincloss (formerly Bouvier), (December 3, 1907 – July 22, 1989) was an American socialite. She was the mother of the former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Lee Radziwill.

==Early life and education==
Janet Norton Lee was born on December 3, 1907, in Manhattan, New York City. She was the middle daughter of James T. Lee (1877–1968), a lawyer and real estate developer, and Margaret A. Merritt (1880–1943). Although she made differing claims about her genealogy, including that she was “from the Maryland Lees,” both her parents were of Irish Catholic descent. She had two sisters: Marion Merritt Lee (1904–1947), who married John J. Ryan Jr. and was subsequently the mother of Mary Cecil, wife of William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil, and Margaret Winifred Lee (1910–1991), who married Franklin D&#x27;Olier.

Janet graduated from Miss Spence&#x27;s School and attended Sweet Briar and Barnard Colleges. She was a member of the Barnard College class of 1929 but records show that she did not graduate. She was a three-time winner of the hunter championship at the National Horse Show.

== Career ==
Bouvier served as a board member of the Newport Historical Society and the Redwood Library. She was also the honorary director of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association in Stratford, Virginia.

==Personal life==
Bouvier was married three times. In 1928, she married her first husband, John Vernou Bouvier III (1891–1957). He was the son of Major John Vernou Bouvier Jr. (1866–1948), a successful attorney, and Maude Frances Sergeant (1870–1940). He was also the brother of Edith Bouvier Beale (1895–1977), later known as the subject of the documentary film, &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;. Together, they were the parents of two daughters:

*Jacqueline Lee Bouvier (1929–1994), who married John F. Kennedy in 1953. After his assassination in 1963, she later married Aristotle Onassis in 1968 and remained married to Onassis until his death in 1975.
*Caroline Lee Bouvier (1933–2019), who married Michael Temple Canfield in 1953. Their marriage was annulled in 1962, and later that same year she married Prince Stanisław Albrecht Radziwiłł. They divorced in 1974. In 1988 she married the director Herbert Ross. They also divorced in 2001.

Mr. Bouvier&#x27;s womanizing and drinking led to a separation in 1936, a brief reconciliation for a few months in 1937, and then a divorce in 1940.

In 1942, she married her second husband, Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Jr., an attorney and Standard Oil heir; becoming his third wife. Together, they had two children:

*Janet Jennings Auchincloss (1945–1985), who was married to Lewis Polk Rutherfurd in 1966.
*James Lee Auchincloss (born 1947)

Hugh Auchincloss died in 1976. In 1979, she married for a third time, to her childhood friend Bingham Willing &quot;Booch&quot; Morris (1906–1996). Jacqueline served as her witness. Morris, a widower, was a retired investment banker who lived in Southampton, New York, a graduate of St. George&#x27;s School and Harvard, where he was a member of the Iroquois and Hasty Pudding Clubs, and was the son of Violet Lee (née Willing) Morris and John Boucher Morris of Baltimore. His late wife, Mary (née Rawlins) Morris, was a bridesmaid at Janet&#x27;s first wedding. They separated in 1981, but remained married until her death from complications arising from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1989.

<doc id="476165" wikidata="Q922241" url="?curid=476165" title="Nobutake Kondō">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. As commander of IJN 2nd Fleet, the Navy&#x27;s principal detached force for independent operations, Kondō was regarded as second in importance only to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kondō was a native of Osaka. He graduated at the head of his class of 172 cadets from the 35th session of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1907. As a midshipman he served on the cruiser and battleship . After his commissioning as ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser , destroyer and battleship . From 1912 to 1913 he was a naval attaché to the United Kingdom. After his return to Japan, he served briefly on the , then in a number of staff positions throughout World War I. From 1916 to 1917 he was chief Gunnery Officer on .

After the end of the war, Kondō attended the Naval Staff College, and was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 December 1919.

From 1920 to 1923, Kondō was stationed in Germany, as part of the Japanese delegation to confirm Germany&#x27;s adherence to the provision of the Treaty of Versailles. On his return to Japan, he was stationed for six months on the battleship , and promoted to commander on 1 December 1923. From 1924 to 1925, he was an aide-de-camp to Crown Prince Hirohito. On completion of this task, he became an instructor at the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy and was promoted to captain. He subsequently served in a number of positions on the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. He was captain of the from 1929 to 1930 and of the battleship &quot;Kongō&quot; from 1932 to 1933.

Kondō was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1933, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet in 1935, and vice admiral on 15 November 1937.

===World War II===
After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Kondō commanded the IJN 5th Fleet in the Hainan Island Operation and Swatow Operation off of southern China.

At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kondō commanded the IJN 2nd Fleet, participating in the invasions of Malaya, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. He was overall commander for the Indian Ocean Raid. During the Battle of Midway, he commanded the Midway Occupation Force and Covering Group. Subsequently, his forces played a leading role during the Guadalcanal campaign, seeing combat in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons (23–25 August 1942) and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands (26–27 October).

In the second night action of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 14/15 November 1942, Kondō personally led the battleship along with cruisers , , , and , in what was to have been a decisive attack to eliminate the threat from Henderson Field through a massive nocturnal shelling. Instead, Kondō was confronted by an American task force with battleships and , and was defeated, losing &quot;Kirishima&quot;. This defeat marked a turning point of the entire Guadalcanal campaign.

Kondō was apparently tainted by the Guadalcanal failures, and was soon removed from seagoing commands, or indeed any positions of real authority. Yamamoto&#x27;s demotion of Kondō was nonetheless less harsh than that of his predecessor, Hiroaki Abe, due to Imperial Navy culture and politics. Kondō, who also held the position of second in command of the Combined Fleet, was a member of the upper staff and &quot;battleship clique&quot; of the Imperial Navy while Abe was a career destroyer specialist. Kondō was not reprimanded or reassigned but instead was left in command of one of the large ship fleets based at Truk.

Kondō was appointed Deputy Commander of the Combined Fleet in October 1942 and was promoted to full admiral on 29 April 1943. He became Commander in Chief of the China Area Fleet from December 1943 until May 1945, when he was appointed to the Supreme War Council.

<text>Seed trees are trees left after reproduction cutting to provide seeds for natural regeneration in the seed-tree method. These trees serve as both the gene source for the new crop of regeneration and as a source of timber during future cuttings. Because of its importance, a seed tree should be carefully chosen based upon both economic and biological factors. Selected seed trees should be the desired species, phenotypically superior, prolific in seeding and flowering, sturdy and healthy, free of damage, and of good growth form.

After the site has been successfully regenerated, seed trees may be commercially harvested or the trees may be retained for visual enhancement and as backup against catastrophic losses of regeneration due to agents such as fire or drought. The presence of seed trees distinguishes the seed-tree method from clearcutting. Many people consider the seed-tree method more aesthetically pleasing than clearcutting because some mature trees are retained on the site for at least until regeneration becomes well established.

The seed-tree method is usually applied to plants with a wind-blown seed (Scots pine), rather not to those with hard seeds, such as oak and beech which do not travel far from the originating tree.

<text>The Singapore dollar (sign: S$; code: SGD) is the official currency of the Republic of Singapore. It is divided into 100 cents (, , ). It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or S$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issues the banknotes and coins of the Singapore dollar.

As of 2024, the Singapore dollar is the 13th most traded currency in the world. Apart from its use in Singapore, the Singapore dollar is also accepted as customary tender in Brunei according to the Currency Interchangeability Agreement between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam). Likewise, the Brunei dollar is also customarily accepted in Singapore.

==History==

The Spanish-American silver dollar brought over by the Manila galleons was in wide circulation in Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries. From 1845 to 1945 the Straits Settlements (of which Singapore used to be part) issued its local equivalent, the Straits dollar. This was replaced by the Malayan dollar, and, from 1953, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar, which were issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. 

Singapore continued to use the common currency upon joining Malaysia in 1963 and after Singapore&#x27;s independence from Malaysia in 1965, but the formal monetary union between Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei stopped in 1967, and Singapore established the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore (BCCS), on 7 April 1967 and issued its first coins and notes. Nevertheless, the Singapore dollar was exchangeable at par with the Malaysian ringgit until 8 May 1973 under the Interchangeability Agreement, and interchangeability with the Brunei dollar is still maintained. 

Initially, the Singapore dollar was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate of two shillings and four pence to the dollar, or £1 = S$60/7 or S$8.57; in turn, £1 = US$2.80 from 1949 to 1967 so that US$1 = S$3.06. This peg to sterling was broken in 1967 when the pound was devalued to US$2.40 but the peg to the U.S. dollar of US$1 = S$3.06 was retained. This peg remained for a short time after the Nixon Shock of the early 1970s. As Singapore&#x27;s economy grew and its trade links diversified to many other countries and regions, Singapore moved towards pegging its currency against a fixed and undisclosed trade-weighted basket of currencies from 1973 to 1985.

Before 1970, the various monetary functions associated with a central bank were performed by several government departments and agencies. As Singapore progressed, the demands of an increasingly complex banking and monetary environment necessitated streamlining the functions to facilitate the development of a more dynamic and coherent policy on monetary matters. Therefore, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act in 1970, leading to the formation of MAS on 1 January 1971. The MAS Act gave the MAS the authority to regulate all elements of monetary, banking, and financial aspects of Singapore. 

From 1985 onwards, Singapore adopted a more market-oriented exchange regime, classified as a Monitoring Band, in which the Singapore dollar is allowed to float (within an undisclosed bandwidth of a central parity) but closely monitored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) against a concealed basket of currencies of Singapore&#x27;s major trading partners and competitors. This, in theory, allows the Singaporean government to have more control over imported inflation and to ensure that Singapore&#x27;s exports remain competitive.

On 1 October 2002, the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore (BCCS) merged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which took over the responsibility of banknote issuance.

==Currency in circulation==
As of 2012, the total currency in circulation was S$57.278 billion. All issued Singapore currency in circulation (notes and coins) are fully backed by external assets in its Currency Fund to maintain public confidence. Such external assets consists of all or any of the following: (a) gold and silver in any form; (b) foreign exchange in the form of demand or time deposits; bank balances and money at call; Treasury Bills; notes or coins; (c) securities of or guaranteed by foreign governments or international financial institutions; (d) equities; (e) corporate bonds; (f) currency and financial futures; (g) any other asset which the Authority, with the approval of the President of Singapore, considers suitable for inclusion.

In 2017, the government, in the second reading of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill 2017, announced that the Currency Fund will be merged with other funds of the MAS, because the currency in circulation is effectively backed by the full financial strength and assets of MAS, which is much larger than the Currency Fund. As at 31 March 2017, MAS&#x27;s assets (S$395 billion) were more than seven times larger than the assets of the Currency Fund (S$55 billion). The proposed amendment will merge the Currency Fund with the other funds of MAS and streamline MAS&#x27;s operations. The Government has said that its support for the currency in circulation, as set out in the Currency Act, remains unchanged.

Singapore&#x27;s foreign reserves officially stood at over US$288.2 billion, as of July 2022 according to the MAS.

==Coins==
===Marine series 1967===
In 1967, the first series of coins was introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 dollar. These coins depicted wildlife and other images relating to the island nation and were designed by Stuart Devlin, the same artist credited for the 1966 designs on Australia&#x27;s decimal coin series. The sizes were the same as those used for the Malaysian ringgit and based directly on the old coinage of the former Malaya and British Borneo dollar. The 1-cent coin was bronze while the other denominations were copper-nickel. Later, in 1976, the 1-cent coin was changed to copper-clad steel. The production of the first series was phased out by 1985.
===Floral series 1985===
In 1985, the second series of coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 dollar. The reverse of these coins were designed by Christopher Ironside. The new series offered smaller coins depicting a floral theme. One-dollar banknotes were discontinued and gradually replaced with an aluminium-bronze coin. The 5-cent coin was also changed to aluminum-bronze while the 10, 20, and 50 cents remained copper-nickel. Limited numbers of commemorative bimetallic 5-dollar coins with scalloped edges were also periodically issued later during this series. This series is still in circulation. The 1 cent coin was taken out of circulation in 2002.
===Iconic series 2013===
On 21 February 2013, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced a new series of coins in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and 1 dollar, which went into circulation on 25 June 2013, featuring Singapore&#x27;s national icons and landmarks.
The coins are struck on a multi-ply plated-steel planchet used by the Royal Canadian Mint and comes with enhanced features to differentiate from fakes. The coins also feature new designs, the one-dollar, now a bi-metallic coin featuring the Merlion, the fifty cents coin featuring the Port of Singapore, the twenty-cent coin depicts Changi International Airport, the ten-cent coin featuring public housing and the five-cent coin featuring the Esplanade. The second and third series of Singaporean coins have medallic orientation.

==Banknotes==

===Orchid series 1967===

The Orchid Series of currency notes is the earliest to be in for circulation in Singapore. Issued in the years 1967 to 1976, it has nine denominations: $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $500, $1,000, and $10,000.

Each note has an orchid design in the centre of the note&#x27;s front, the orchid being the national flower of Singapore. A scene of Singapore is depicted on the back, which varies across denominations. Standard on each note, is the Coat of Arms, a lion head watermark, and the signature of the Minister for Finance and chairman of the BCCS, on the front of the note. As an added security feature, all notes have at least one vertically embedded security thread, while the $10,000 note has two.

===Bird series 1976===

The Bird Series of currency notes is the second set of notes to be issued for circulation in Singapore. Issued in the years 1976 to 1984, it has nine denominations, the same number as in the Orchid Series, albeit the $25 note was replaced by the $20 note.

Each note features a bird on the left side of the note&#x27;s front, a theme selected to represent a young Singapore &quot;ever ready to take flight to greater heights&quot;. Standard on each note, is the Coat of Arms, a lion head watermark, and the signature of the Minister for Finance and chairman of the BCCS, on the front of the note. As an added security feature, all notes have a vertically embedded security thread, while the $1,000 and $10,000 notes have two.

===Ship series 1984===

The Ship Series of currency notes is the third set of notes to be issued for circulation in Singapore. Issued in the years 1984 to 1999, it retains the number of denominations as was in the previous two series of notes, but switches the $20 note for the $2 one.

A maritime theme to reflect Singapore&#x27;s maritime heritage was adopted, and progressively shows across the various denominations, the different kinds of ships which have plied Singapore&#x27;s waters as the country developed. These vignettes are located on the front of the note. On the back, various scenes depicting Singapore&#x27;s achievements are shown, as well as an orchid, to symbolise the country&#x27;s national flower.

Standard on each note, is the Coat of Arms, a lion head watermark, and the signature of the Minister for Finance and chairman of the BCCS, on the front of the note. As an added security feature, all notes have a vertically embedded security thread.

===Portrait series 1999===
The current Portrait series was introduced in 1999, with the one- and 500-dollar denominations omitted. These notes feature the face of Yusof bin Ishak, the first president of the Republic of Singapore, on the obverse, and the reverse depicts a feature of civic virtue. There are both paper and polymer notes in circulation. The designs of the polymer notes are very similar to the corresponding paper note except for the slightly slippery feel and a small transparent window design in the corner of the banknote. Polymer notes are progressively replacing the paper banknotes in circulation. The notes also have Braille patterns at the top right-hand corner of the front design.

The S$10,000 and B$10,000 note are the world&#x27;s most valuable banknotes (that are officially in circulation). As of August 2011, it is worth over seven times as much as the next most valuable, the 1,000-Swiss franc note. On 2 July 2014, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that it would stop printing $10,000 notes starting from 1 October 2014 to reduce the risk of money laundering, with all banks instructed to exchange the notes with MAS and not recirculate them. This is a trend in many countries like European Central Bank&#x27;s discontinuation of the 500-euro banknote in 2016 and AMBD&#x27;s announcement to stop the production and issuance of the B$10,000 (the largest banknote) in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. MAS would also stop producing the S$1,000 banknote as well from 1 January 2021 onwards, but banks would be allowed to recirculate existing notes with customers. The MAS said that the higher denomination notes (beyond $100) will continue to remain legal tender.

===Commemorative banknotes===

Commemorative banknotes are also released, usually in limited quantities. The first commemorative banknote was released on 24 July 1990 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Singapore&#x27;s independence. Of the 5.1 million $50 polymer banknotes issued, 300,000 came with an overprint of the anniversary date &quot;9 August 1990&quot;. This $50 note was the first commemorative note issued by the BCCS and was also the first polymer banknote in the history of Singapore&#x27;s currency. In addition, the $50 note was the first note designed in Singapore by a Singapore artist.

On 8 December 1999, to celebrate the coming 2000 millennium, three million $2 millennium notes were circulated. The note is similar to the $2 portrait series, except that the prefix of the serial number is replaced with a Millennium 2000 logo. These millennium notes are printed on paper as polymer notes had not yet been introduced at the time.

On 27 June 2007, to commemorate 40 years of currency agreement with Brunei, a commemorative S$20 note was launched; the back is identical to the Bruneian $20 note launched simultaneously. A circulation version of the $20 note can be exchanged at banks in Singapore beginning 16 July 2007, limited to two pieces per transaction.

On 18 August 2015, to commemorate Singapore&#x27;s 50 years of nation-building, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a set of six commemorative notes. These commemorative notes comprise five S$10 polymer notes and a S$50 note. The note design&#x27;s draw inspiration from significant milestones and achievements in Singapore&#x27;s history, the multiracialism that defines the nation and the values and aspirations that underpin Singapore&#x27;s progress. The front of both the $50 and $10 notes feature a portrait of Yusof Ishak, Singapore&#x27;s first president, as in the current Portrait series notes. The $50 note highlights Singapore&#x27;s history, transformation and future. It shows the late Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, shouting &quot;Merdeka!&quot;—the rallying cry of Singapore&#x27;s independence struggle. The note makes distinctive use of the colour gold, reflecting Singapore&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. The five $10 notes have a common front design and varying back designs depicting the theme &#x27;Vibrant Nation, Endearing Home&#x27;. Each note reflects a value or aspiration that defines the theme: &#x27;Caring Community, Active Citizenry&#x27;, &#x27;Opportunities for All&#x27;, &#x27;Safe and Secure&#x27;, &#x27;Strong Families&#x27; and &#x27;...regardless of race, language or religion...&#x27;.

In 2017, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its Currency Interchangeability Agreement between Brunei and Singapore, both the Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam and the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued $50 polymer banknotes to commemorate that event.

On 5 June 2019, a $20 note commemorating the Singapore Bicentennial was issued.

<text>Luísa Dias Diogo (born 11 April 1958) is a Mozambican politician who served as Prime Minister of Mozambique from February 2004 to January 2010. She replaced Pascoal Mocumbi, who had been prime minister for the previous nine years. Before becoming prime minister, she was Minister of Planning and Finance, and she continued to hold that post until February 2005. 

She was the first female prime minister of Mozambique. Diogo represents the party FRELIMO, which has ruled the country since independence in 1975.

==Early life and education==
Diogo studied economics at Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo. She graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1983. She went on to obtain a master&#x27;s degree in financial economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 1992.

==Career==
Diogo began working in the Mozambique Finance Ministry in 1980 while she was still a college student. She became head of department in 1986 and national budget director in 1989. She then went to work for the World Bank, as the programme officer in Mozambique. In 1994 she joined the FRELIMO government as Deputy Minister of Finance under Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.

In 2003, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Diogo to the United Nations Commission on the Private Sector and Development, which was co-chaired by Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada and President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.

===Prime Minister, 2004–2010===
Diogo was appointed prime minister in February 2004, succeeding Pascoal Mocumbi. She continued to hold her post as finance minister until 2005.

In September 2005, Diogo was the international guest speaker at the British Labour Party Conference.

In 2006, Annan appointed Diogo to co-chair – alongside Shaukat Aziz and Jens Stoltenberg – a High-level Panel on United Nations Systemwide Coherence, which was set up to explore how the United Nations system could work more coherently and effectively across the world in the areas of development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. She was also a member of the Commission on Effective Development Cooperation with Africa which was set up by the Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark and held meetings between April and October 2008.

After reports that some farmers were refusing to leave their livestock in areas threatened by the 2007 Mozambican flood, Diogo ordered forcible evacuations of citizens in low-lying areas of the Zambezi valley.

During her time in office, Diogo urged the African health ministers to offer reproductive and sexual health services free of charge throughout the continent. These services could reduce infant mortality by two thirds, reduce maternal mortality by three quarters, reverse the spread of AIDS, and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. The target set by the UN was to achieve these goals by 2015.

Diogo also focused on gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment through a recently launched &quot;Network of Women Ministers and Parliamentarians&quot; (MUNIPA). The MUNIPA network aims to strengthen advocacy and lobbying activities so that policies and legislation are adopted favourable to gender equity and women&#x27;s empowerment. Promoting equality between men and women is a central concern of the Mozambican government, which has been adopting instruments to promote women&#x27;s empowerment at all levels [of government].

==Life after politics==
In August 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Diogo to the High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability, which was co-chaired by presidents Tarja Halonen of Finland and Jacob Zuma of South Africa.

In 2014, Diogo came second to Filipe Nyusi in FRELIMO’s elections for candidate in that year’s general elections. At the time, she was backed by a party faction led by Chissano.

In 2016, Diogo was appointed by Erik Solheim, the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee, to serve on the High Level Panel on the Future of the Development Assistance Committee under the leadership of Mary Robinson.

==Trivia==
In a 2010 op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Irish musician and activist Bono described Diogo as having &quot;the lioness energy of an Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala or a Graça Machel.&quot;

<doc id="476184" wikidata="Q1072150" url="?curid=476184" title="Chickahominy River">
<text>The Chickahominy is an river in eastern Virginia. The river, which serves as the eastern border of Charles City County, rises about northwest of Richmond and flows southeast and south to the James River. The river was named after the Chickahominy Indian tribe who lived near the river when the English colonists arrived in 1607. Chickahominy descendants live in Charles City County today.

During the American Civil War (1861–65), the upper reaches of the river became a major obstacle to Union General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign, a failed attempt in 1862 to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. Docile, narrow, and relatively easily crossed during dry weather, after periods of rain, the river expands across a flood plain with swamps as much as a mile across. The Chickahominy was in flood stage and divided the Union Army during crucial periods, despite continuous efforts by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to build and maintain bridges. Other battles were fought nearby in 1864.

Part of a popular recreational area for boating, waterskiing, and sport fishing, featuring Walkers Dam and Chickahominy Lake, the lower Chickahominy River has become a major source of drinking water for the lower portion of the Virginia Peninsula in modern times. It also serves as a border for the Chickahominy Wildlife Management Area.

==Geologic definition==
The Chickahominy River is a Coastal Plain tributary to the James River with headwaters northwest of Richmond. For its first , the Chickahominy flows over igneous and metamorphic bedrock of the Piedmont, but soon becomes a Coastal Plain stream near Mechanicsville. The low-gradient Chickahominy sluggishly flows through broad swampy lowlands for from Henrico County to eastern New Kent County. southeast of Providence Forge, the Chickahominy River becomes an estuary and makes a turn towards to the south.

When the sea level was higher during warmer (non-glacial) periods in the Pleistocene, the Chickahominy was a much broader river. The ancient riverbanks and meander loops are still recognizable. As sea level rose after the last glacial interval (during the last 20,000 years), the Chickahominy has also risen, causing old flood plains and valleys to be backfilled as marshes.

==History==
In 1607, Captain John Smith, one of the Jamestown settlers, traveled with others up the Chickahominy in the hope that it would prove to be a passage to the Pacific Ocean. Smith was captured by warriors of the Chickahominy tribe and taken to meet Chief Powhatan. According to legend, he was rescued by Powhatan&#x27;s daughter, Matoaka (Pocahontas).

In the 19th century, the Chickahominy River was bordered in many places by swampy forests, which during heavy rains and spring thaw were so covered with water as to be almost impassable. At such times, the river&#x27;s normally narrow path could expand to be as much as a mile wide. This small river became a major obstacle and natural force to be dealt with during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

===1862: Peninsula Campaign===
In the spring and summer of 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign, General George B. McClellan pushed a Union force up the Virginia Peninsula from Fort Monroe at the mouth of Hampton Roads in an attempt to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. After McClellan&#x27;s troops had taken Yorktown on the York River, his army followed the retreating Confederates, and gained another victory over them on May 5, 1862, at Williamsburg, the old colonial capital, which was located on high ground between the York and James Rivers about below the mouth of the Chickahominy. The Confederates retreated northwest and crossed the Chickahominy near the point where New Kent, Henrico, and Hanover counties border each other, in modern times known as Bottoms Bridge. A portion of the Union army followed them, while other portions remained east of the river. 
Not long after the Union forces were aligned on either side of the apparently docile Chickahominy River, a period of heavy rains came on and the river and swamps were so flooded that they became almost completely impassable. The Union army was thus cut in two; for though the two halves were only a short distance apart, their only means of reaching each other was by a bridge many miles away.

General Joseph E. Johnston, who commanded the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, resolved to attack the two (of five) corps that were south of the river and destroy them before the rest of the army could come to their aid. The attack was made in two places, at the railroad station of Fair Oaks and (about a mile away) at the crossroads of Seven Pines. (The battle is often referred to in the North as the Battle of Seven Pines; the South calls it the Battle of Fair Oaks.) At first the Union troops were driven back and almost beaten, but meanwhile the soldiers on the other side of the Chickahominy had succeeded in building a bridge. Several thousand Union men hurried across to help, driving the Confederates back. General Johnston was severely wounded (May 31). The next day the attack was renewed at Fair Oaks, but the Confederates were again defeated and they retreated in disorder to Richmond.

It is surmised that if General McClellan had followed them into Richmond, he would have probably taken the city. Instead, he advanced slowly and cautiously, thinking the Confederate forces there were much larger. The slow advance gave the Confederates time to build forts and to receive reinforcements. In a few weeks, the Confederates had nearly as many men as the Federals, and their army was now commanded by General Robert E. Lee.

General McClellan up to this time had received his provisions and supplies by the way of the York River, and his base (that is, the place where his provisions were landed) was at White House on the Pamunkey River. He also heavily depended upon the recently completed Richmond and York River Railroad to supply his forces. 

General Lee&#x27;s army recrossed the Chickahominy southwest of Mechanicsville, trying to get between the Union army and White House and prevent the Union army from gaining provisions. Instead of trying to prevent this, General McClellan resolved to change his base to Harrison&#x27;s Landing or City Point on the James River, about east of Richmond. To do this, he had to unite his army on the west side of the Chickahominy and march toward City Point.

The Confederates had already attacked the Union Army at Mechanicsville on the east side of the river, but after the bloody battle they were driven back (June 26). A still more bloody battle was fought on the next day at the Battle of Gaines&#x27; Mill, from Mechanicsville near a crossroads called Cold Harbor. There General McClellan had left a rear-guard under General Fitz John Porter, while the rest of the army crossed the river. But the rear-guard was attacked so fiercely that many thousands recrossed the river to help it, and even then it was hardly saved from a terrible defeat. At night the rear-guard crossed the river, and the whole army was united on the west side (the side nearest to Richmond).

They might easily have taken most of the city, for General Lee and most of his army were still on the east side of the Chickahominy, and farther away from Richmond than McClellan was. But McClellan still supposed that a large army was defending the city, and they began to retreat towards City Point, fighting as they went. At Savage&#x27;s Station, east of Fair Oaks, they had a large hospital and many military stores. The stores were burned and a train of cars loaded with bombshells was set on fire; at the same time the engine was started, and as the train rushed off the shells exploded, until the cars reached a broken bridge, where they plunged into the river. Soon after the Confederates attacked the Federals at the station and drove them away, capturing the hospital with 2,500 wounded soldiers (June 29).

On the next day they made another fierce attack at Frayser&#x27;s Farm, where a bloody battle was fought without much advantage being gained on either side. Finally (July 1) almost the whole Confederate army attacked the Union army at Malvern Hill, but they were beaten back with terrible slaughter and the Union army reached Harrison&#x27;s Landing in safety.

The battles fought by Lee against McClellan from June 25 to July 1, 1862, are often called the Seven Days Battles. The Union loss during this time was 15,200; the Confederate loss, 19,400.

===1864: Overland Campaign===
On June 3, 1864, a second battle was fought at Cold Harbor, between Union army under General Ulysses S. Grant and the Confederates under General Lee. The Confederates had much the smaller army, but they were in strong entrenchments, where the Union army attacked them. After one of the bloodiest battles of the war, the Unionists were driven back, leaving the ground covered with dead and wounded.

==Walkers Dam==
About upstream from the confluence with the James River is Walkers Dam. Its construction resulted in the creation of the Chickahominy Lake.

Walkers Dam was built in 1943 during World War II by the U.S. War Department to ensure an adequate water supply for the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company and other military operations on the lower peninsula.

It is now owned by Newport News Waterworks, a regional water utility that serves more than 400,000 customers in Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, and parts of York and James City counties. The Chickahominy River is the utility&#x27;s primary water source.

==Crossing of Rt. 5 near mouth==
Near the mouth of the river and its confluence with the James River, State Route 5 crosses the river on the Judith Stewart Dresser Bridge, a fixed-span bridge between Charles City County and James City County built in 2009. It replaced a swing-span movable bridge that was built in 1939. The new $33.6 million fixed-span began construction in 2007 and opened on January 24, 2009. Located just west of the previous structure, it rises to a height of and includes a separate pathway for the Virginia Capital Trail.

The clearance for recreational boats used to be when the bridge was in the closed position. Vehicles on the highway were also limited by a 13&#x27;11&quot; clearance restriction. The bridge was built on wood pilings and became increasingly troublesome mechanically and expensive to maintain as it aged.

==Fishing==
Fishing is a popular activity along the Chickahominy, both above and below Walkers Dam. Among the most popular are blue catfish, largemouth bass, river herring, striped bass, shad, bowfin and yellow perch.

==Rowing==
The Rowing Clubs of the College of William and Mary and the Williamsburg Boat Club in nearby Williamsburg and James City County practices on the river.

<doc id="476196" wikidata="Q8000741" url="?curid=476196" title="Wild On!">
<text>Wild On! was a travel show that was produced from 1997 until 2003 by E!. Each episode followed a celebrity host as they experienced the food, culture, and nightlife of a certain region.

==Overview==
Sometimes referred to as Wild on E! The series featured exciting travel destinations including Rio de Janeiro, Cancun, Las Vegas, Australia, Miami and Milan.

&quot;Wild on!&quot; had three primary hosts over the years: Jules Asner (1997–1999), Brooke Burke (1999–2002), and Cindy Taylor (2002–2003). The show also had a variety of guest hosts during its run, including models such as Victoria Silvstedt, Jenna Jameson, Tim Cheveldae, Karen McDougal and Ashley Massaro, &quot;Baywatch&quot; actress Brooke Burns and actress Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale). In the last few years, Art Mann provided comic relief as a co-host.

The E! American broadcasts usually censored nudity. However, broadcasts on the Canadian network Star!, mainland Europe, United Kingdom/Ireland, late night showings on E! Latino, and the Australian re-edit &quot;Naked Wild On!&quot; are uncensored.

==Cancellation==
The show&#x27;s ratings peaked during &#x27;The Brooke Burke Years&#x27;, but took a major dive when Brooke Burke left the show at the end of 2002.

The show originally was supposed to have a new season in 2005 with Tara Reid as the new host. However, a week before the start of the new season, E! changed the focus of the show based on the footage from Tara&#x27;s travels, and decided to reconfigure it as a reality program based around Tara traveling the world with her friends. The show&#x27;s title was then changed to &quot;Taradise&quot;, with the travelogue format of the show dropped and the focus exclusively on Tara. The E! International network, broadcast out of the UK, shows &quot;Taradise&quot; under the name &quot;Wild On Tara!&quot;

The program was eventually dropped, even in repeat form as E! began to add original studio late night programming to their schedules, along with the aging of those repeats.

==Naked Wild On!==
&quot;Naked Wild On!&quot; is an Australian re-edit of &quot;Wild On!&quot; in the style of &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;. It brings together various scenes of nudity and lesbianism within the show into a series of themed episodes (see below). All episodes are uncensored and narrated for comical effect. They are all 30 minutes long including commercials.

===Episode list===
Some episode titles use alliteration.
* &quot;Decadent Destinations&quot;
* &quot;Sinful Cities&quot;

<doc id="476197" wikidata="Q199024" url="?curid=476197" title="Texas sharpshooter fallacy">
<text>The Texas sharpshooter fallacy is an informal fallacy which is committed when differences in data are ignored, but similarities are overemphasized. From this reasoning, a false conclusion is inferred. This fallacy is the philosophical or rhetorical application of the multiple comparisons problem (in statistics) and apophenia (in cognitive psychology). It is related to the clustering illusion, which is the tendency in human cognition to interpret patterns where none actually exist.

The name comes from a metaphor about a person from Texas who fires a gun at the side of a barn, then paints a shooting target centered on the tightest cluster of shots and claims to be a sharpshooter.

== Structure ==

The Texas sharpshooter fallacy often arises when a person has a large amount of data at their disposal but only focuses on a small subset of that data. Some factor other than the one attributed may give all the elements in that subset some kind of common property (or pair of common properties, when arguing for correlation). If the person attempts to account for the likelihood of finding &quot;some&quot; subset in the large data with &quot;some&quot; common property by a factor other than its actual cause, then that person is likely committing a Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

The fallacy is characterized by a lack of a specific hypothesis prior to the gathering of data, or the formulation of a hypothesis only after data have already been gathered and examined. Thus, it typically does not apply if one had an &quot;ex ante&quot;, or prior, expectation of the particular relationship in question before examining the data. For example, one might, prior to examining the information, have in mind a specific physical mechanism implying the particular relationship. One could then use the information to give support or cast doubt on the presence of that mechanism. Alternatively, if a second set of additional information can be generated using the same process as the original information, one can use the first (original) set of information to construct a hypothesis, and then test the hypothesis on the second (new) set of information. (See hypothesis testing.) However, after constructing a hypothesis on a set of data, one would be committing the Texas sharpshooter fallacy if they then tested that hypothesis on the same data (see hypotheses suggested by the data).

== Examples ==
A Swedish study in 1992 tried to determine whether power lines caused some kind of poor health effects. The researchers surveyed people living within 300 metres of high-voltage power lines over 25 years and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those who lived closest to the power lines, which spurred calls to action by the Swedish government. The problem with the conclusion, however, was that the number of potential ailments, i.e., over 800, was so large that it created a high probability that at least one ailment would have a statistically significant correlation with living distance from power lines by chance alone, a situation known as the multiple comparisons problem. Subsequent studies failed to show any association between power lines and childhood leukemia.

The fallacy is often found in modern-day interpretations of the quatrains of Nostradamus. Nostradamus&#x27;s quatrains are often liberally translated from their original (archaic) French versions, in which their historical context is often lost, and then applied to support the erroneous conclusion that Nostradamus predicted a given modern-day event after the event actually occurred.

<doc id="476200" wikidata="Q1889422" url="?curid=476200" title="The Odd Couple (play)">
<text>The Odd Couple is a play by Neil Simon. Following its premiere on Broadway in 1965, the characters were revived in a successful 1968 film and 1970s television series, as well as several other derivative works and spin-offs. The plot concerns two mismatched roommates: the neat, uptight Felix Ungar and the slovenly, easygoing Oscar Madison. Simon adapted the play in 1985 to feature a pair of female roommates (Florence Ungar and Olive Madison) in The Female Odd Couple. An updated version of the 1965 show appeared in 2002 with the title Oscar and Felix: A New Look at the Odd Couple.

==History==
Sources vary as to the origins of the play. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s obituary of Simon&#x27;s brother Danny, a television writer, Adam Bernstein wrote that the idea for the play came from his divorce. &quot;Mr. Simon had moved in with a newly single theatrical agent named Roy Gerber in Hollywood, and they invited friends over one night. Mr. Simon botched the pot roast. The next day, Gerber told him: &#x27;Sweetheart, that was a lovely dinner last night. What are we going to have tonight?&#x27; Mr. Simon replied: &#x27;What do you mean, cook you dinner? You never take me out to dinner. You never bring me flowers.&#x27;&quot; Danny Simon wrote a partial first draft of the play, but then handed over the idea to Neil.

However, in the Mel Brooks biography &quot;It&#x27;s Good to Be the King&quot;, author James Robert Parish claims that the play came about after Simon observed Brooks, in a separation from his first wife, living with writer Speed Vogel for three months. Vogel later wrote that Brooks had insomnia, &quot;a brushstroke of paranoia&quot;, and &quot;a blood-sugar problem that kept us a scintilla away from insanity&quot;.

===Boston tryout===
Simon credited Boston critic Elliot Norton with helping him develop the final act of the play. Norton practiced drama criticism when the relationship between the regional critic and playwrights whose shows were undergoing tryouts in their towns were not as adversarial as they were to become.

Appearing on the public television show &quot;Elliot Norton Reviews&quot;, during Simon&#x27;s conversation with the critic, Norton said that the play went &quot;flat&quot; in its final act. As it appeared originally at Boston&#x27;s Colonial Theatre, the characters the Pigeon Sisters did not appear in the final act.

Simon told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;: He invited one of the stars and the writer. He loved the play and gave it a wonderful review but he said the third act was lacking something. On the show he said, &#x27;You know who I missed in the third act was the Pigeon Sisters,&#x27; and it was like a light bulb went off in my head. It made an enormous difference in the play. I rewrote it and it worked very well. I was so grateful to Elliot ... Elliot had such a keen eye. I don&#x27;t know if he saved the play or not, but he made it a bigger success.

==Plot overview==
Felix Ungar, a neurotic, neat freak news writer (a photographer in the television series), is thrown out by his wife, and moves in with his friend Oscar Madison, a slovenly sportswriter. Despite Oscar&#x27;s problems – careless spending, excessive gambling, a poorly kept house filled with spoiled food – he seems to enjoy life. Felix, however, seems utterly incapable of enjoying anything and only finds purpose in pointing out his own and other people&#x27;s mistakes and foibles. Even when he tries to do so in a gentle and constructive way, his corrections and suggestions prove extremely annoying to those around him, eventually breaking up the ritual weekly poker game with friends. Oscar, his closest friend, feels compelled to throw him out after only a brief time together, though he quickly realizes that Felix has had a positive effect on him.

==Characters==
*Felix Ungar: A fastidious, hypochondriac news writer whose marriage is ending. The play and the film both spell Felix&#x27;s name &quot;Ungar&quot;, while the television series spells it &quot;Unger&quot;. 
*Oscar Madison: A slovenly, recently divorced sportswriter and Felix&#x27;s best friend.
*Murray: A NYPD policeman, one of Felix&#x27;s and Oscar&#x27;s poker buddies.
*Speed: One of the poker buddies. Gruff and sarcastic, often picking on Vinnie and Murray. 
*Vinnie: One of the poker buddies. Vinnie is mild-mannered and henpecked, making him an easy target for Speed&#x27;s verbal barbs.
*Roy: One of the poker buddies. Oscar&#x27;s accountant. Roy has a dry wit but is less acerbic than Speed.
*Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon: Felix and Oscar&#x27;s giggly upstairs neighbors, a pair of English sisters. Cecily is a divorcée, and Gwendolyn a widow.

==Productions==

&quot;The Odd Couple&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on March 10, 1965, and transferred to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre where it closed on July 2, 1967, after 964 performances and two previews. Directed by Mike Nichols, the cast starred Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison and Art Carney as Felix Ungar. The production gained Tony Awards for Walter Matthau, Best Actor (Play), Best Author (Play), Best Direction of a Play, and Best Scenic Design (Oliver Smith), and was nominated for Best Play.

Matthau was replaced with Jack Klugman in November 1965, and then Pat Hingle in February 1966. Carney was replaced with Eddie Bracken in October 1965 and later Paul Dooley.

===Stage revivals===
In 1968, James Wheaton directed an all black version of the show at the Ebony Showcase Theatre in Los Angeles. The production starred Nick Stewart and Morris Erby. The cast also included Larry McCormick in his acting debut.

In 1970, the McMaster Shakespearean Players performed &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; with Martin Short as Felix, Eugene Levy as Oscar, and Dave Thomas as Murray; all three actors would later find fame as cast members of &quot;SCTV&quot;.

In 1989, Ronald Harwood directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, with Derek Griffiths as Oscar and Sam Kelly as Felix.

In 1994, a version of the play moved to The Kings Theatre, Glasgow and toured Scotland, starring Gerard Kelly as Felix, Craig Ferguson as Oscar and Kate Anthony as Gwendolyn Pigeon. Kelly reprised the role of Felix at the 2002 Edinburgh Fringe, opposite Andy Gray.

In 1996, Klugman and Tony Randall reprised their roles from the TV series for a three-month run at the Theatre Royal in Haymarket, London. The production was an effort to raise money to support Randall&#x27;s National Actors Theatre. (Klugman had previously played Oscar in London opposite Victor Spinetti as Felix.)

In a 1997 issue of &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams announced a possible stage revival, in anticipation of success of their film &quot;Fathers&#x27; Day&quot; (1997). When that film failed at the box office, the Crystal–Williams revival was abandoned.

Also in 1997, a tour of the US and Canada was mounted by Troupe America and Lake Pepin Players featuring former costars of the TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Jamie Farr as Oscar, William Christopher as Felix, along with William Richard Rogers as Murray. The production was directed by Curt Wollan.

In 2001, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; host Pat Sajak and Hawaii TV news anchor Joe Moore (Sajak&#x27;s Vietnam roommate and close friend) played Felix and Oscar at the Hawaii Theatre Center as a benefit for Hawaii&#x27;s Manoa Valley Theater.

In 2002, Simon wrote an updated version of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, titled &quot;Oscar and Felix: A New Look at the Odd Couple&quot;. This version incorporated updated references and elements into the original storyline. This production ran at the Geffen Playhouse (Los Angeles) from June 2002 to July 21, 2002 with a cast that starred Gregory Jbara (Vinnie), John Larroquette (Oscar), Joe Regalbuto (Felix) and María Conchita Alonso (Ynes) and was directed by Peter Bonerz. 

A revival of the original version opened on Broadway at The Brooks Atkinson Theatre on October 27, 2005, and closed on June 4, 2006, after 249 performances. Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane played Felix and Oscar, respectively. Due to illness, Lane was replaced for three performances in January 2006 by Brad Garrett, who played Murray earlier in the same production.

In August 2005, British comedians Bill Bailey and Alan Davies played Oscar and Felix at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival directed by Guy Masterson which was the hit of the festival.

A reading featuring Ethan Hawke and Billy Crudup was staged at the Cherry Lane Theatre on January 9, 2011.

A Venezuelan production appeared at the Trasnocho Cultural Theater in 2009. It was Directed by Armando Alvarez and featured Armando Cabrera (Oscar), Luigi Sciamanna (Felix), Juan Carlos Ogando (Richard), Alezander Slorzano (Murray), Alexandra Malave (Clementina), and Stephanie Cardone (Cecilia).

The all-female Takarazuka Revue Company performed the show under the title in September 2011 in Takarazuka, Japan. It starred Yu Todoroki as Oscar and Misa Noeru as Felix.

In 2011, Cezary Żak and Artur Barciś (popular actors from the Polish hit TV series &quot;Ranczo&quot;) performed as Oscar and Felix in &quot;Dziwna Para&quot;, a Polish rendition of &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; The play was performed in the U.S and in Toronto, Canada, and received good reviews.

In 2016, Australian comedians Shaun Micallef and Francis Greenslade starred as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison in a version of the play directed by Peter Houghton. The play was performed at Southbank Theatre, Melbourne from November 5 to December 22, 2016, and received positive reviews.

==Female version==
In 1985, Neil Simon revised &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; for a female cast. &quot;The Female Odd Couple&quot; was based on the same story line and same lead characters, now called Florence Ungar and Olive Madison. The poker game became &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; with their friends becoming the girlfriends: Mikey, Sylvie, Vera, and Renee. The English-born Pigeon sisters became the Spanish-born Costazuela brothers, Manolo and Jesus.

&quot;The Female Odd Couple&quot; opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on June 11, 1985, and closed on February 23, 1986, after 295 performances and nine previews. Directed by Gene Saks, responsible for the 1968 film version, the leads were Sally Struthers as Florence (Felix) and Rita Moreno as Olive (Oscar), respectively, with Lewis J. Stadlen and Tony Shalhoub (in his Broadway debut) as the Costazuela brothers. Moreno was later replaced by Brenda Vaccaro. Struthers indicated on Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot; that Moreno was very difficult to work with. 
A London production of this version ran at the Apollo Theatre in 2001 and starred Paula Wilcox (Florence) and Jenny Seagrove (Olive).

Translated into Spanish as &quot;La extraña pareja&quot;, the female version opened in Madrid in 2017. It was directed by Andrés Rus and the lead roles were played by Susana Hernáiz (Olga/Olive) and Elda García (Flora/Florence).

== Film and TV adaptations ==
Neil Simon sold film and TV rights to Paramount Pictures in 1967. Paramount produced two theatrical films, three live-action TV series and an animated series based upon the play.

=== 1968 film ===
In 1968, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; was made into a highly successful film starring Jack Lemmon as Felix and Walter Matthau reprising his role from the play. Much of the script from the play is the same, although the setting is expanded: instead of taking place entirely in Oscar&#x27;s apartment, some scenes take place at various locations in New York. The film was also written by Simon (who was nominated for an Academy Award) and was directed by Gene Saks.

In 1998, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau reprised their roles for the film sequel &quot;The Odd Couple II&quot;, produced by Neil Simon.

=== 1970–1975 ABC sitcom ===
The success of the film was the basis for the 1970–75 ABC television sitcom, starring Tony Randall as Felix and Jack Klugman as Oscar. Klugman was familiar with the role as he had replaced Walter Matthau in the original Broadway run. Neil Simon originally disapproved of this adaptation, but by the series&#x27; final season, he reassessed the show positively to the point of appearing in a cameo role.

Randall and Klugman also reunited in 1993 for a made-for-TV reunion film based upon the series, &quot;The Odd Couple Together Again&quot;. The movie was initially broadcast on CBS on September 24, 1993. Robert Klane was the writer and director, with a cast that included Barbara Barrie as Felix&#x27;s wife, Penny Marshall as Myrna and Dick Van Patten. Jack Klugman&#x27;s real-life throat-cancer surgery was written into the script, when Felix (Tony Randall) stays with Oscar and helps with his rehabilitation.

=== 1975 ABC cartoon ===
In the fall of 1975, ABC aired a cartoon version of the play entitled &quot;The Oddball Couple&quot;, produced by Paramount and DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The roles were played by a neat cat named Spiffy and a sloppy dog named Fleabag. Unlike every live-action incarnation of Neil Simon&#x27;s work, the pair&#x27;s jobs were reversed. The neat cat was a writer, while the sloppy dog was a photographer.

=== 1982–1983 ABC sitcom ===
In 1982, ABC aired a new version of the series, entitled &quot;The New Odd Couple&quot;. Produced by Garry Marshall, the premise of the new version has two black actors, Ron Glass as Felix and Demond Wilson as Oscar. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer noted: &quot;What may be surprising is how little the &quot;spine&quot; of the show has changed. The dialogue has been updated a little, but the plots are essentially the same. &quot;The New Odd Couple&quot; bounces along nicely. It adds nothing new to the craft of situation comedy, but it does provide employment and a good showcase for talented black actors, who generally don&#x27;t have an easy time of it on television these days&quot;. This new version was not successful and was canceled after just 13 episodes.

=== 2015 CBS sitcom ===

Another adaptation, again called &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, was a multi-camera comedy that ran for three seasons on CBS from 2015 to 2017. The series starred Matthew Perry as Oscar and Thomas Lennon as Felix; it was a pet project for Perry, who also served as the show&#x27;s co-developer, co-executive producer and co-writer. The show also featured Wendell Pierce as Teddy, Oscar&#x27;s agent, Yvette Nicole Brown as Dani, Oscar&#x27;s assistant, Dave Foley as Roy (a holdover from the original play), and Leslie Bibb and Lindsay Sloane as Casey and Emily (taking over for the Pigeon sisters).

<text>Nirad Chandra Chaudhuri CBE (23 November 1897 – 1 August 1999) was an Indian writer.

In 1990, Oxford University awarded Chaudhuri, by then a long-time resident of the city of Oxford, an Honorary Degree in Letters. In 1992, he was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

==Biography==

Chaudhuri was born in Kishoregunj, Mymensingh, East Bengal, British India (now Bangladesh), the second of eight children of Upendra Narayan Chaudhuri, a lawyer, and of Sushila Sundarani Chaudhurani. His parents were liberal middle-class Hindus who belonged to the Brahmo Samaj movement.

After passing the FA examination, he was admitted to Ripon College (now Surendranath College) in Calcutta along with eminent Bengali writer, Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. After that, Neerad got admission in history department in Scottish Church College in Calcutta. As a student of Scottish Church College under Calcutta University in 1918, he graduated with honors in history and earned his place in the merit list. He participated in the Scottish Church College seminar with renowned Indian personality and historian Professor Kalidas Nager. After obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree, he was admitted to Calcutta University for his master&#x27;s degree. But he could not get the postgraduate degree because he did not appear in the examination. This is where his formal education ended. Meanwhile, in 1917, he wrote a theoretical article titled Objective Methods in History.

Chaudhuri moved to England in the 1959s, and settled in Oxford in the 1979s. 

Chaudhuri was a prolific writer even in the last years of his life, publishing his last work at the age of 99. His wife Amiya Chaudhuri died in 1994 in Oxford, England. He too died in Oxford, three months short of his 102nd birthday, in 1999. He lived at 20 Lathbury Road from 1982 until his death and a blue plaque was installed by the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board in 2008.

Dr. Sumantra Maitra named him the forgotten visionary of British India, in a review essay for &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

==Major works==
His masterpiece, &quot;The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian&quot;, published in 1951, put him on the long list of great Indian writers. Chaudhari had said that &quot;The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian&quot; is &#x27;more of an exercise in descriptive ethnology than autobiography&#x27;. He is concerned with describing the conditions in which an Indian grew to manhood in the early decades of the century, and as he feels that the basic principle of book is that environment shall have precedence over its product; he describes in affectionate and sensuous detail the three places that had the greatest influence on him: Kishoreganj, the country town in which he lived till he was twelve; Bangram; his ancestral village; and Kalikutch, his mother&#x27;s village. A fourth chapter is devoted to England, which occupied a large place in his imagination. Later in the book he talks about Calcutta, the Bengali Renaissance, the beginnings of the nationalist movement, and his experience of the Englishmen in India as opposed to the idyllic pictures of a civilization he considered perhaps the greatest in the world. These themes remains preoccupations in most of Chaudhari&#x27;s work, as does his deterministic view of culture and politics. He courted controversy in the newly independent India due to the dedication of the book, which ran thus:

&lt;poem&gt;
To the memory of the British Empire in India,
Which conferred subjecthood upon us,
But withheld citizenship.
To which yet every one of us threw out the challenge:
&quot;Civis Britannicus sum&quot;
Because all that was good and living within us
Was made, shaped and quickened
By the same British rule.
&lt;/poem&gt;

It is sometimes stated that &#x27;Chaudhuri was hounded out of government service, deprived of his pension, blacklisted as a writer in India and forced to live a life of penury&#x27;. However, as sociologist Edward Shils, who helped Chaudhuri immigrate to the UK, stated in his article &#x27;Citizen of the World&#x27; (American Scholar, 1988), Chaudhuri retired at the compulsory age of 55 but was not eligible for a pension because he had not completed sufficient years of service. It is also stated that - &#x27;Furthermore, he had to give up his job as a political commentator on All India Radio as the Government of India promulgated a law that prohibited employees from publishing memoirs.&#x27; This is not the case. There was a pre-existing rule that employees must get clearance before publishing anything. Chadhuri was refused an extension of service. He was not asked to prepare any more talks on a free-lance basis because of severe criticism directed at him by senior figures - like Krishna Menon. However, he did publish in non-Government magazines. 
Chaudhuri argued that his critics were not careful-enough readers; &quot;the dedication was really a condemnation of the British rulers for not treating us as equals&quot;, he wrote in a 1997 special edition of &quot;Granta&quot;. Typically, to demonstrate his perceptions he drew on a parallel with Ancient Rome. The book&#x27;s dedication, Chaudhuri observed, &quot;was an imitation of what Cicero said about the conduct of Verres, a Roman proconsul of Sicily who oppressed Sicilian Roman citizens, who in their desperation cried out: &quot;Civis romanus sum&quot;.

At the age of 57, in 1955 for the first time Chaudhuri went abroad. After coming back he wrote &quot;A Passage to England&quot; (1959). In this book he talked about his visit of five weeks to England, and more briefly about his two weeks in Paris and one week in Rome. During this time away from his home in Delhi, he visited museums, galleries, cathedrals, country houses, and attended plays and concerts. Chaudhuri reflects on his experiences from the perspective of a man who had grown up in the British Empire and was now the citizen of an independent India.

His later works include personal essays, biographies and historical studies.

<doc id="476210" wikidata="Q17065542" url="?curid=476210" title="CalTrain (Los Angeles)">
<text>CalTrain was a short-lived commuter rail system in the Los Angeles area which operated between 1982–1983. It connected downtown Los Angeles&#x27;s Union Station with Oxnard in Ventura County, using the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was the first local rail service in Los Angeles since 1961 and was a forerunner of the modern Metrolink Ventura County Line. Service ended in the face of high costs, lower-than-expected ridership, a changing political climate, and staunch opposition from the Southern Pacific.

== History ==
CalTrain had its gestation in a 1973 study by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), which recommended two daily roundtrips between Union Station and Oxnard. The train would use the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Coast Line. Amtrak already operated a single long-distance train, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, over the route. SP objected to the proposal, alleging that the service would disrupt freight service on the single-track line, leading to a protracted dispute before the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The PUC ruled against the SP several times, with a final order in June 1982, ordering that SP operate the service beginning on October 18.

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provided funding of $6 million for the service. Some of the money was to be spent on capital improvements, such as new station platforms. These would be located on Southern Pacific (SP) territory, prompting additional litigation between SP, Caltrans, and the PUC. The SP challenged the authority of the transportation agencies to construct these platforms on its property without its consent. After a ruling by the Supreme Court of California in favor of Caltrans the service proceeded, with the start date unchanged. It was the first local rail service in Los Angeles since Pacific Electric discontinued operations on April 8, 1961.

CalTrain faced serious problems almost immediately. George Deukmejian replaced Jerry Brown as Governor of California on January 3, 1983. Deukmejian favored highway projects over public transit, and showed no enthusiasm for what many called a &quot;pet project&quot; of the former governor. Daily ridership stood at 300–350 passengers, disappointing Caltrans officials who hoped for 2,600 daily riders. Additional issues remained in the disagreement between the state and the SP over the tariff that the state should pay to the SP for the use of its infrastructure. The state, together with local governments, was prepared to pay between $70,000-100,000 per month, while the SP insisted on a higher figure of $588,000. By February $200,000 remained of the original $6 million allocation, which did not include the $2–3 million potentially owed the SP should its figure be upheld.

Service ended on March 2, 1983, after storms damaged a trestle. On March 11, the PUC indefinitely suspended the service - which was to be restored on March 14 - due to the dispute between Caltrans and the SP. The SP was ordered not to &quot;remove or modify&quot; the platforms and parking areas at the former stations.

The tariff dispute was further litigated, with the Interstate Commerce Commission eventually ruling in 1985 in favor of the SP. This ruling ended attempts to resurrect commuter rail service in southern California until Metrolink began operation with the opening of the Ventura County Line on October 26, 1992, in which they assumed ownership of the corridor.

Three years later, service was gradually restored to the former CalTrain route which would continue over the next eight years. The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; (which still served Glendale and Oxnard) added a Simi Valley stop on October 26, 1986. On June 26, 1988, Amtrak extended one daily &quot;San Diegan&quot; round trip to Santa Barbara, restoring service to Van Nuys (Panorama City) and Chatsworth; a Burbank Airport stop was added in 1990. Metrolink Ventura County Line service began on October 26, 1992, stopping at all former CalTrain stations (except Oxnard, which Metrolink began serving after the 1994 Northridge earthquake).

== Equipment ==
Los Angeles County refused to allow the use of its &quot;El Camino&quot; equipment, then stored at Bell, so Caltrans looked elsewhere. Throughout its short history CalTrain&#x27;s equipment situation remained in flux. Initially CalTrain used GE P30CH diesel locomotives and single-level Amfleet coaches leased from Amtrak. Caltrans then leased four bilevel coaches from Chicago&#x27;s Regional Transportation Authority to replace the Amfleet coaches. These had barely entered service before the SP ordered all P30CHs in the country sidelined because of a derailment in Texas. CalTrain had to use EMD GP9s and bilevel coaches from the SP&#x27;s Peninsula Commute equipment pool. The Chicago cars could now not be used because they required head end power (HEP) for heating and the SP&#x27;s locomotives used steam heat, which was not compatible.

== Station stops ==
When service began in 1982 intermediate stops included Simi Valley, Panorama City, and Glendale. Planned additional stops included Camarillo, Moorpark, Chatsworth, Northridge, Burbank Airport, and Burbank. Chatsworth opened on December 29, 1982. Service to Moorpark began in early 1983; service to Burbank Airport began in February 1983, just prior to the service&#x27;s discontinuance.

<text>Carson McCullers (February 19, 1917 – September 29, 1967) was an American novelist, short-story writer, playwright, essayist, and poet. Her first novel, &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; (1940), explores the spiritual isolation of misfits and outcasts in a small town of the Southern United States. Her other novels have similar themes. Most are set in the Deep South.

McCullers&#x27;s work is often described as Southern Gothic and indicative of her Southern roots. Critics also describe her writing and eccentric characters as universal in scope. Her stories have been adapted to stage and film. A stage adaptation of her novel &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; (1946), which captures a young girl&#x27;s feelings at her brother&#x27;s wedding, made a successful Broadway run in 1950–51.

==Early life==
McCullers was born Lula Carson Smith in Columbus, Georgia, in 1917 to Lamar Smith, a jeweler, and Marguerite Waters. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Lula Carson Waters. She had a younger brother, Lamar Jr. and a younger sister, Marguerite. Her great grandfather on her mother&#x27;s side was a planter and Confederate soldier. Her father was a watchmaker and jeweler of French Huguenot descent. From the age of ten, she took piano lessons; when she was fifteen, her father gave her a typewriter to encourage her story writing.

Smith graduated from Columbus High School. In September 1934, at age 17, she left home on a steamship bound for New York City, planning to study piano at the Juilliard School of Music. After losing the money she was going to use to study at Juilliard on the subway, she decided instead to work, take night classes, and write. She worked several odd jobs, including as a waitress and a dog walker. After falling ill with rheumatic fever, she returned to Columbus to recuperate, and she changed her mind about studying music. Returning to New York, she worked in menial jobs while pursuing a writing career; she attended night classes at Columbia University and studied creative writing under Texas writer Dorothy Scarborough and with Sylvia Chatfield Bates at Washington Square College of New York University. In 1936, she published her first work, &quot;Wunderkind&quot;, an autobiographical piece that Bates admired, depicting a music prodigy&#x27;s adolescent insecurity and losses. It first appeared in &quot;Story&quot; magazine and is collected in &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot;.

From 1935 to 1937, as her studies and health dictated, she divided her time between Columbus and New York. In September 1937, aged 20, she married an ex-soldier and aspiring writer, Reeves McCullers. A &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile described her husband as &quot;a dreamer attracted to big, capable women&quot;. They began their married life in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Reeves had found work as a credit salesman. The couple made a pact to take alternating turns as writer then breadwinner, starting with Reeves&#x27;s taking a salaried position while McCullers wrote. Her eventual success as a writer precluded his literary ambitions.

==Career==
Maxim Lieber was McCullers&#x27;s literary agent in 1938 and intermittently thereafter. In 1940, at the age of 23, writing in the Southern (US) Gothic or perhaps Southern (US) realist traditions, McCullers completed her first novel, &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;. The title was suggested by her editor and was taken from the poem &quot;The Lonely Hunter&quot; by the Scottish poet Fiona MacLeod. At the time the novel was thought to suggest an anti-Fascist message.

After completing &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; in 1939 (then titled &quot;The Mute&quot;), McCullers and her husband moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where she completed &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (then titled &quot;Army Post&quot;) in the span of two months. She sold the book to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; for five hundred dollars in August 1940. It was published in two parts in the magazine in October and November.

With influences such as Isak Dinesen, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Tolstoy, she published eight books; the best known are &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; (1940), &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; (1946). The novella &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Café&quot; (1951) depicts loneliness and the pain of unrequited love; at the time of its writing, McCullers was a resident at Yaddo, the artists&#x27; colony in Saratoga Springs, New York.

In &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;, McCullers describes the feelings of a young girl at her brother&#x27;s wedding. The Broadway stage adaptation of the novel had a successful run in 1950–51 and was produced by the Young Vic in London in September 2007. The original production won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for the best play of the season.

Many know her works largely by their film adaptations, neither of which she lived to see. &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; was adapted as a film with the same title in 1968, with Alan Arkin in the lead role. &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; was directed by John Huston (1967) and starred Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. McCullers died a fortnight before that film&#x27;s premiere in October 1967. Huston, in his autobiography, &quot;An Open Book&quot; (1980), wrote of her: 
I first met Carson McCullers during the war when I was visiting Paulette Goddard and Burgess Meredith in upstate New York. Carson lived nearby, and one day when Buzz and I were out for a walk she hailed us from her doorway. She was then in her early 20s, and had already suffered the first of a series of strokes. I remember her as a fragile thing with great shining eyes, and a tremor in her hand as she placed it in mine. It wasn&#x27;t palsy, rather a quiver of animal timidity. But there was nothing timid or frail about the manner in which Carson McCullers faced life. And as her afflictions multiplied, she only grew stronger.

Richard Wright, the author of &quot;Black Boy&quot;, reviewed her first novel, published in 1940 when she was 23, and said she was the first white writer to create fully human black characters. In his review &#x27;Hugo: Secrets of the Inner Landscape&#x27;, he stated:
==Later life==
Carson and Reeves McCullers divorced in 1941. After separating from Reeves she moved to New York to live with George Davis, the editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. She became a member of February House, an art commune in Brooklyn. Among her friends were W. H. Auden, Benjamin Britten, Gypsy Rose Lee and the writer couple Paul Bowles and Jane Bowles. After World War II McCullers lived mostly in Paris. Her close friends during these years included Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams. During this period of separation, Reeves had a relationship with the composer David Diamond, and the two lived together in Rochester, New York.

McCullers fell in love with a number of women and pursued them sexually with great determination. Love letters written to McCullers from Annemarie Clarac-Schwarzenbach are at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Her most documented and extended love obsession was with Annemarie Schwarzenbach, of whom she once wrote &quot;She had a face that I knew would haunt me for the rest of my life.&quot; In her autobiography, McCullers reports that the two shared one kiss. McCullers&#x27;s passion, however, was not reciprocated, and the two remained friends with McCullers dedicating her next novel, &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;, to her. Sarah Schulman writes:
There is the infamous obsession with Katherine Anne Porter and a much-implied ongoing &quot;friendship&quot; with Gypsy Rose Lee. But if Carson ever actually had sex with a woman, even Tennessee [Williams] didn&#x27;t hear of it. According to McCullers&#x27;s brilliant biographer, Virginia Spencer Carr, Carson did brag to her male cousin that she&#x27;d had sex with Gypsy once. But if that was the case, she never mentioned it to any of her gay friends. In the absence of reciprocated lesbian love and the inability to consummate lesbian sex, McCullers still wore a lesbian persona in literature and in life. She clearly wrote against the grain of heterosexual convention, wore men&#x27;s clothes, was outrageously aggressive in her consistently failed search for sex and love with another woman, and formed primary friendships with other gay people.

In 1945, Carson and Reeves McCullers remarried. Three years later, while severely depressed, she attempted suicide. In 1953, Reeves tried to persuade her to commit suicide with him, but she fled and Reeves killed himself in their Paris hotel with an overdose of sleeping pills. Her bittersweet play &quot;The Square Root of Wonderful&quot; (1957) drew upon these traumatic experiences. In the 1950s, McCullers was in therapy for a variety of reasons, and discussed with her therapist, Dr. Mary A. Mercer, the possibility of being a lesbian.

McCullers dictated her unfinished autobiography, &quot;Illumination and Night Glare&quot; (1999), during the final months of her life. Her home from 1945 to 1967 in South Nyack, New York, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

==Death==
McCullers suffered throughout her life from several illnesses and from alcoholism. At the age of 15, she contracted rheumatic fever, which resulted in rheumatic heart disease. As a result of the heart damage sustained, McCullers suffered from strokes that began in her youth. In 1962, she had a breast cancer surgery and mastectomy. She lived the last twenty years of her life in Nyack, New York, where she died on September 29, 1967, at the age of 50, after a brain hemorrhage. She is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Criticism==
McCullers&#x27;s style is often described as Southern Gothic, as the majority of her works take place in the Southern United States and feature eccentric characters suffering from loneliness interspersed by moments of deep empathy. In a discussion with the Irish critic and writer Terence de Vere White, McCullers said, &quot;Writing, for me, is a search for God&quot;. Other critics have variously detected tragicomic or political elements in her writing.

The most recent scholarly collection of commentaries on her work is &quot;Carson McCullers in the Twenty-First Century&quot; (2016), edited by Graham-Bertolini and Kayser.

==Legacy==
McCullers&#x27;s childhood home in Columbus, Georgia, is now owned by Columbus State University and is the central location of the university&#x27;s Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians. The center is dedicated to preserving the legacy of McCullers; to nurturing American writers and musicians; to educating young people; and to fostering the literary and musical life of Columbus, the state of Georgia, and the American South. To that end, the center operates a museum in the Smith–McCullers&#x27; home, presents extensive educational and cultural programs for the community, maintains an ever-growing archive of materials related to the life and work of McCullers, and offers fellowships for writers and composers who live for periods of time in the Smith-McCullers home in Columbus.

While the center operates out of the Smith–McCullers house, the writer&#x27;s childhood home and museum is open to the public.

In 1944, when McCullers&#x27;s father died, her mother left Columbus and moved to Nyack, New York, where she bought her daughter&#x27;s famed Nyack home. McCullers lived with her mother and sister off and on in this house for a number of years, eventually buying the house from her mother. McCullers was living in this house when she died in 1967. In December 2006 the house in Nyack was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

McCullers&#x27;s therapist and longtime friend, Dr. Mary E. Mercer, bequeathed the house in Nyack to Columbus State University&#x27;s Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians, the same center that owns and operates out of McCullers&#x27;s childhood home in Columbus, Georgia. At Dr. Mercer&#x27;s death in late April 2013, the McCullers Center inherited not only the house but also many artifacts and documents that shed light on the last ten years of McCullers&#x27;s life.

The two former McCullers houses now owned by Columbus State University together contain the world&#x27;s most extensive research collection on the author.

The Rainey-McCullers School of the Arts in Columbus, Georgia, is named in honor of McCullers and fellow Columbus native Ma Rainey.

Charles Bukowski wrote a poem about Carson McCullers.

She influenced Edward Albee, who adapted her novella &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; into a play.

In 2020, American writer Jenn Shapland published &quot;My Autobiography of Carson McCullers&quot;, which recounts Shapland&#x27;s discovery of McCullers&#x27; letters to Swiss writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach. Shapland&#x27;s book contends McCullers was queer, or closeted. Other critics have noted that &quot;McCullers camouflaged her love for women in her fiction, [and] gay and lesbian themes are inarguably present in her work.&quot; Mary Dearborn published her book, &quot;Carson McCullers: A Life&quot;, in 2024.

<text>HMS &quot;Cossack&quot; was a destroyer named after the Cossack people of the Eurasian steppe. She became famous for the boarding of the German supply ship &quot;Altmark&quot; in Norwegian waters, and the associated rescue of sailors originally captured by the . She was torpedoed by the on 23 October 1941, and sank four days later.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Cossack&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

===Wartime modifications===
Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals&#x27; anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace &#x27;X&#x27; mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.

== Construction and career ==

Authorized as one of nine Tribal-class destroyers under the 1936 Naval Estimates, &quot;Cossack&quot; was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 19 June 1936 from Vickers-Armstrongs and was laid down on 9 June at the company&#x27;s High Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, shipyard. Launched on 8 June 1937, &quot;Cossack&quot; was completed on 10 June 1938 and commissioned four days later at a cost of £341,082 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty.

On 7 November 1939 &quot;Cossack&quot; collided with SS &quot;Borthwick&quot; in the Firth of Forth en route from Scapa Flow to Leith Docks. Several people were injured and at least five were killed, being buried in Seafield Cemetery in north Edinburgh.

===&quot;Altmark&quot; incident===

&quot;Cossack&quot;″s first action was on 16 February 1940, under the command of Philip Vian. This was the Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjord, Norway which resulted in the freeing of the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s prisoners, who were being held aboard the supply ship , and the death of eight crew members of the German ship.

In the incident the German tanker rammed her with the stern at an angle of about 30° at the level of her bridge and drove the destroyer towards the fjord wall. The Norwegian officers present later reported that only the mass of ice piled up prevented the destroyer being crushed onto the rocky shore. The powerful engines of the destroyer made her escape from the squeeze possible. &quot;Cossack&quot; arrived at Leith on 17 February with the 299 freed prisoners. She had to be docked for her propeller and A-brackets to be checked in case they had been damaged by the fjord&#x27;s thick ice. They were unharmed, but her stern plating had to be repaired where it had been bumping against &quot;Altmark&quot;.

The Norwegian government subsequently protested at &quot;Cossack&quot;″s breach of Norway&#x27;s neutrality and demanded the return of the British prisoners of war; the German government also protested that the incident had been a violation of international law.

===Second Battle of Narvik===
&quot;Cossack&quot; participated in the Second Battle of Narvik in April 1940. Entering Narvik harbour at 14.15 hrs, she engaged a stationary German destroyer Z17. Broadside on, she was hit 7 times in 2 minutes, causing serious damage &amp; breaking her steering gear. Out of control, Cossack ran aground on the shore. When her adversary, Diether von Roeder, ran out of ammunition, she was scuttled. With temporary repairs, Cossack refloated during the night at high tide and crawled her way stern-first to Skelfjord, Lofotens, where she was patched up sufficiently to limp home. In the brief but violent harbour engagement, Cossack lost 9 killed and 21 wounded. Later that year, she was part of the force which was assigned to hunt for a German surface raider that had been reported breaking out into the North Atlantic. The force consisted of the battlecruiser , the light cruiser , and the destroyers , , , and &quot;Cossack&quot;. The report turned out to be false, so after spending a week at sea, including Christmas Day, she returned to port on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

===Chasing &quot;Bismarck&quot;===
In May 1941, she participated in the pursuit and destruction of the . While escorting Convoy WS-8B to the Middle East, &quot;Cossack&quot; and four other destroyers broke off on 26 May, and headed towards the area where &quot;Bismarck&quot; had been reported. They found &quot;Bismarck&quot; that evening and made several torpedo attacks in the evening and into the next morning. No hits were scored, but they kept the &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s&quot; gunners from getting any sleep, making it easier for the battleships to attack the &quot;Bismarck&quot; the next morning. During the battle one of Bismarck&#x27;s shells sheared off Cossack&#x27;s antenna.

==Loss==
On 23 October 1941 &quot;Cossack&quot; was escorting a convoy from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom when she was struck by a single torpedo fired by the German submarine commanded by Klaus Bargsten. She was taken in tow by a tug from Gibraltar on 25 October but the weather worsened and the tow was slipped on 26 October. &quot;Cossack&quot; sank in the Atlantic west of Gibraltar on 27 October 1941. 159 of her crew were lost. However, purportedly, the Ship&#x27;s cat, Oskar, survived. Oskar also supposedly survived the sinking of Bismarck and would go on to survive the sinking of HMS Ark Royal after she was torpedoed in November 1941, but it is almost certainly a sailor&#x27;s Tall Tale.

<doc id="476217" wikidata="Q515658" url="?curid=476217" title="Guerrilla Girls">
<text>Guerrilla Girls is an anonymous group of feminist, female artists devoted to fighting sexism and racism within the art world. The group formed in New York City in 1985, born out of a picket against the Museum of Modern Art the previous year. The core of the group&#x27;s work is bringing gender and racial inequality into focus within the greater arts community and society at large. The Guerrilla Girls employ culture jamming in the form of posters, books, billboards, lectures, interviews, public appearances and internet interventions to expose disparities, discrimination, and corruption (the latter includes conflicts of interest within museums). They also often use humor in their work to make their serious messages engaging. The Guerrilla Girls are known for their &quot;guerrilla&quot; tactics, hence their name, such as hanging up posters or staging surprise exhibitions. To remain anonymous, members don gorilla masks. To permit individual identities in interviews, they use pseudonyms that refer to deceased female artists such as Frida Kahlo, Käthe Kollwitz, and Alice Neel, as well as writers and activists, such as Gertrude Stein and Harriet Tubman. According to GG1, identities are concealed because issues matter more than individual identities, &quot;Mainly, we wanted the focus to be on the issues, not on our personalities or our own work.&quot;

==History==
During the height of the contemporary art movement in the late 20th century, many distinguished galleries lacked appropriate representation of female artists and curators. Museums were often privately funded by elites, predominately white males, meaning that museums were documenting power structures rather than art. Historically, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, like other major museums, had an entirely male or a predominantly male board of directors. It had a paucity of female artists on display, while, at the same time, art featuring female nudes were plentiful. The Guerrilla Girls were formed in 1985 with the purpose of exposing gender disparities in the contemporary art world. Initially, it did not plan to be a permanent organization. Its first press release, dated May 6, addressed its &quot;&quot;&quot;campaign throughout the next weeks and next season.&quot; Membership in the group has fluctuated over the years from a high of about 30 women to a handful of active members in 2015 According to Frida Kahlo, there have been a total of 65 members.

In the spring of 1985, seven women launched the Guerrilla Girls in response to the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s exhibition &quot;An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture&quot; (1984), whose roster of 165 artists included only 13 women. Inaugurating MoMA&#x27;s newly renovated and expanded building, this exhibition claimed to survey that era&#x27;s most important painters and sculptors from 17 countries. The proportion of artists of color was even smaller (one account puts the number at eight), and none of them were women.
Comments attributed to the show&#x27;s curator, Kynaston McShine highlight that era&#x27;s explicit art world gender bias: &quot;Kynaston McShine gave interviews saying that any artist who wasn&#x27;t in the show should rethink career.&quot; However, it has been suggested that these putative quotes stem from comments in an interview McShine gave to the &quot;New York Times&quot; before the exhibition opened: “I think that some people can benefit from not being in the show.” He continued: “They will have to think about their work.” In reaction to the low proportion of women in the exhibition and McShine&#x27;s bias, the Women&#x27;s Caucus for the Arts led a protest with pickets across the street from MoMA. Seven future members of the Guerrilla Girls participated in this protest, but when their pickets were ignored, some of the women began to seek what Frida Kahlo calls &quot;a more media-savvy&quot; method of reaching the public.

The MoMA protest&#x27;s lack of success in 1984 led to strategy meetings, which resulted in the formation of the Guerrilla Girls. The initial founding members were all white. The Guerrilla Girls conveyed their messages by wheat-pasted posters in downtown Manhattan, particularly in the SoHo and East Village neighborhoods, which were home to both artists and the commercial galleries that served as their initial targets.

When asked about the masks, the girls answer &quot;We were Guerrillas before we were Gorillas. From the beginning, the press wanted publicity photos. We needed a disguise. No one remembers, for sure, how we got our fur, but one story is that at an early meeting, an original girl, a bad speller, wrote &#x27;Gorilla&#x27; instead of &#x27;Guerrilla&#x27;. It was an enlightened mistake. It gave us our &#x27;mask-ulinity&#x27;.&quot; In an interview with the magazine &quot;Interview&quot; the Guerrilla Girls were quoted, &quot;Anonymous free speech is protected by the Constitution. You&#x27;d be surprised what comes out of your mouth when you wear a mask.&quot;

A year after its founding, the group expanded its focus to include racism in the art world, attracting artists of color. They also took on projects outside of New York, enabling them to address sexism and racism nationally and internationally. Though the art world has remained the group&#x27;s main focus, the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; agenda has included sexism and racism in films, mass and popular culture, and politics. Tokenism also represents a major group concern.

Periodically, the Guerrilla Girls conducted &quot;weenie&quot; and &quot;banana&quot; counts, wherein members visited institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and counted nudes, noting the ration of male-to-female subjects, as well as the ratio of male-to-female artists represented in the various collections. Data gathered from their survey in the Met in 1989 showed that women artists had produced less than 5% of the works in the Modern Art galleries, while 85% of the nudes were female.

Early organizing was based around meetings, during which members evaluated statistical data gathered regarding gender inequality within the New York City&#x27;s art scene. The Guerrilla Girls also worked closely with artists, encouraging them to speak to those within the community to bridge the gender gap where they perceived it.

Since 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have worked for an increased awareness of sexism and greater accountability on the part of curators, art dealers, collectors, and critics. The group is credited, above all, with sparking dialogue, and bringing national and international attention to issues of sexism and racism within the arts.

== Influences ==
Many feminist artists in the 1970s dared to imagine that female artists could produce authentically and radically different art, undoing the prevailing visual paradigm. The pioneering feminist critic, Lucy Lippard curated an all-women exhibition in 1974, effectively protesting what most deemed a deeply flawed approach, that of merely assimilating women into the prevailing art system. Shaped by the 1970s women&#x27;s movement, the Guerrilla Girls resolved to devise new strategies. Most noticeably, they realized that 1970s-era tools such as pickets and marches proved ineffective, as evidenced by how easily MoMA could ignore 200 protestors from the Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art. &quot;We had to have a new image and a new kind of language to appeal to a younger generation of women&quot;, recalls one of the founding Guerrilla Girls, who goes by &quot;Liubov Popova.&quot; The Guerrilla Girls sought an alternative approach, one that would defeat views of the 1970s Feminist movements as man-hating, anti-maternal, strident, and humorless: Versed in poststructuralist theories, they adopted 1970s initiatives, but with a different language and style. Earlier feminists tackled grim and unfunny issues such as sexual violence, inspiring the Guerrilla Girls to keep their spirits intact by approaching their work with wit and laughter, thus preventing a backlash.

==Work: actions, posters and billboards==
===Art world===

Throughout their existence, the Guerrilla Girls have gained the most attention for their bold protest art.
The Guerrilla Girls&#x27; projects (mostly posters at first) express observations, concerns, and ideals regarding numerous social topics. Their art has always been fact-driven, and informed by the group&#x27;s unique approach to data collection, such as &quot;weenie counts.&quot; To be more inclusive and to make their posters more eye-catching, the Guerrilla Girls tend to pair facts with humorous images – a form of word art. Although the Guerrilla Girls gained fame for wheat-pasting provocative campaign posters around New York City, the group has also enjoyed public commissions and indoor exhibitions.

In addition to posting posters around downtown Manhattan, they passed out thousands of small handbills based on their designs at various events. The first posters were mainly black and white fact sheets, highlighting inequalities between male and female artists with regard to a number of exhibitions, gallery representation, and pay. Their posters revealed how sexist the art world was in comparison to other industries and to national averages. For example, in 1985 they printed a poster showing that the salary gap in the art world between men and women was starker than the United States average, proclaiming &quot;Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men do.&quot; These early posters often targeted specific galleries and artists. Another 1985 poster listed the names of some of the most famous working artists, such as Bruce Nauman and Richard Serra. The poster asked &quot;What do these artists have in common?&quot; with the answer &quot;They allow their work to be shown in galleries that show no more than 10% of women or none at all.&quot;

The group was also activists for equal representation of women in institutional art, and highlighted artist Louise Bourgeois in their &quot;Advantages to Being a Women artist&quot;, poster in 1988 as one line read, &quot;Knowing your career might not pick up till after you&#x27;re 80.&quot; Their pieces are also notable for their use of combative statements such as &quot;When racism and sexism are no longer fashionable, what will your art collection be worth?&quot;

&quot;Dearest Art Collector&quot; (1986) is a 560x430 mm screen-print on paper. This is one of thirty posters published in a portfolio entitled &quot;Guerrilla Girls Talk Back&quot;. This print is unusual in the portfolio in that it takes the form of an enlarged handwritten letter on baby pink paper. The extremely rounded cursive script crowned with a frowning flower exudes femininity, symbolizing the biting sarcasm for which the Guerrilla Girls were known. The Guerrilla Girls sent this poster to well-known art collectors across the United States, pointing out how few works they owned by women artists. This send-up of femininity is aimed at the expectation that, even when presenting a serious complaint, women should do so in a socially acceptable &#x27;nice&#x27; way. &quot;We know that you feel terrible about this&quot; appeals to the feelings of the recipient. This piece was a commentary on how hard it is for female artists, and what lengths they must go through in order to be recognized and taken seriously. Women are constantly expected to perform a certain way and this print is the embodiment of how tumultuous it is for women all around the world to be recognized in the eyes of men with power. The group later transcribed it into other languages and sent it to collectors outside the U.S. A practical joke with serious implications, this poster is now (somewhat ironically) a collector&#x27;s item.

The posters were rude; they named names and they printed statistics (and almost always cited the source of those statistics at the bottom, making them difficult to dismiss). They embarrassed people. In other words, they worked.
The Guerrilla Girls&#x27; first color poster, which remains the group&#x27;s most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group&#x27;s first &quot;weenie count&quot;. In response to the overwhelming number of female nudes counted in the modern art sections, the poster asks, sarcastically, &quot;Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?&quot;. Next to the text is an image of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres&#x27;s painting &quot;Grande Odalisque&quot; (1814, Louvre Museum). The Guerrilla Girls placed a gorilla mask over the head of Ingres&#x27; nude, which is one of the most famous female nudes in Western art. The New York Public Art Fund had rejected the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; Metropolitan Museum poster for a billboard they had commissioned from the group. Rather than change the image, the group bought advertising space from the MTA, and the poster traversed lower Manhattan on New York City buses, until the MTA declined to renew their contract (evidently because they thought the fan handle looked phallic). In 2021, the Metropolitan Museum poster was donated to the Met, and in 2021–22, it was featured in the exhibition &quot;Prints: Revolution, Resistance, and Activism&quot;.

A 2005 Guerrilla Girl recount at the Met found that only 3% of the exhibited artists in the modern section were women, whereas the nude females constituted 83% of the nudes in those galleries. The 2012 Guerrilla Girl poster reported 4% women artists, and a figure of 76% female nudes, reflecting a lower percentage of women artists and female nudes from 1985. A survey of other sections of the Metropolitan Museum gives different results. Art critic Christopher Allen states that proportionately more female artists and fewer nudes are in the 18th century section, and Mary Beard writes in her 2018 book, &quot;Civilisations: How Do We Look&quot;, that it took centuries in Greek antiquity until Praxiteles created the first female nude, &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot;.

In 1990, the group designed a billboard featuring the Mona Lisa that was placed along the West Side Highway supported by the New York City Public Art Fund. Stickers also became a popular calling cards representative of the group.

The Guerrilla Girls infiltrated the bathrooms of the newly opened Guggenheim Museum SoHo, placing stickers regarding female inequality on the walls. In 1998, Guerrilla Girls West protested at the San José Museum of Art, over low representation of women artists.

In addition to researching and exposing sexism in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have received commissions from numerous organizations and institutions, such as The Nation (2001), Fundación Bilbao Arte (2002), Istanbul Modern (2006) and Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (2007). They have also partnered with Amnesty International, contributing pieces to a show under the organization&#x27;s &quot;Protect the Human&quot; initiative.

They were interviewed for the film &quot;!Women Art Revolution&quot;.

In 1987, the Guerrilla Girls published thirty posters in a portfolio entitled Guerrilla Girls Talk Back. One specifically, &quot;We Sell White Bread&quot;, was a poster made to gradually widen their focus, tackling issues of racial discrimination in the art world and also making more direct, politicized interventions. In 1987, the image on this poster was first seen as peel-off stickers on gallery windows and doors in New York. Its medium, screen print on paper, has the words &quot;We Sell White Bread&quot; and are stamped on a slice of white bread alongside a list of ingredients that includes the white male artists whose work is on display at the galleries. According to the poster, the galleries favored white, male artists, noting that the gallery &quot;contains less than the minimum daily requirement of white women and non-whites&quot;.

===Public commissions===

In 2005, the group exhibited large-format posters &quot;Welcome to the Feminist Biennale&quot; at the Venice Biennale (the first in 110 years to be overseen by women), scrutinizing 101 years of Biennale history in terms of diversity. &quot;Where Are the Women Artists of Venice?&quot; explored the fact that most works owned by Venice&#x27;s historical museums are kept in storage.

Since 2005, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to produce special projects for international institutions, sometimes for the very institutions, they have criticized. Offers that pose a dilemma are carefully considered, so as to avoid censure since one way to improve institutions is to criticize them from inside.

Their 2006 poster &quot;The Future for Turkish Women Artists as Revealed by the Guerrilla Girls&quot;, commissioned by İstanbul Modern, demonstrated that the status of women artists in Turkey was better than in the rest of Europe. In 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published their &quot;Horror on the National Mall!&quot;, a one-page newspaper spread attacking the absence of diversity among tax-payer supported museums on the Mall in Washington, DC. During the 2007 ART-ATHINA, the Guerrilla Girls projected &quot;Dear Art Collector&quot; in Greek onto the entrance&#x27;s façade. In 2015, they projected their &quot;Dear Art Collector&quot; animation onto a museum façade, taking on collectors who fail to pay employees a living wage. To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre, the University of Quebec commissioned their &quot;Troubler Le Repos&quot; (Disturbing The Peace) poster, whose texts addressed anti-women hate speech since Ancient Greece to Rush Limbaugh.

In 2009, they launched &quot;I&#x27;m not a feminist, but If I were this is what I&#x27;d complain about ... &quot;, an interactive graffiti wall that enables women who don&#x27;t see themselves as feminists the means to target gender issues with the hope that active participation will broaden their perspectives. In 2012, this traveled to Krakòw&#x27;s Art Boom Festival.

In 2011, Columbia College Chicago&#x27;s Glass Curtain Gallery and Institute for Women and Gender in the Arts and Media commissioned the first Guerrilla Girls survey of Chicago museums. The resulting banner entitled &quot;Chicago Museums [Guerrilla Girls to Museums: Time for Gender Reassignment!]&quot; critiqued gender disparity in the contemporary art collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

In 2012, an advertising truck towed &quot;Do women Have To Be Naked To Get into Boston Museums?&quot; around Boston. Invited by Yoko Ono to participate in the 2013 Meltdown Festival, the Guerrilla Girls updated their 2003 &quot;Estrogen Bomb&quot; poster, which had premiered in The Village Voice in 2003.

During Winter 2016, they participated in &quot;Twin City Takeover&quot;, art exhibitions and art projects organized by a consortium of local art organizations sited around Minneapolis and St. Paul.
In 1996 Guerrilla Girls came out with Planet Pussy in Monkey Business issue #4 in November 1996. This was a work about feminism and was published by Sike Burmeister and Sabine Schmidt.

===Film world===
To protest the dearth of female directors, the Guerrilla Girls distributed stickers during the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. The Nation invited them to present &quot;Birth of Feminism&quot;, which they updated and presented in 2007 as a banner outside Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts. Since 2002, Guerrilla Girls Inc. have designed and installed billboards during the Oscars that address white male dominance in the film industry, such as: &quot;Anatomically Correct Oscars&quot;, &quot;Even the Senate is More Progressive than Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Birth of Feminism&quot;, &quot;Unchain the Women Directors&quot;.

During the 2015 Reykjavík Arts Festival, the Guerrilla Girls displayed &quot;National Film Quiz&quot;, a billboard criticizing the fact that 87% of national funding for films goes to men, despite women playing an important part of Iceland&#x27;s public and private sectors. In light of 2016&#x27;s #Oscarssowhite campaign, the Guerrilla Girls updated the above billboards, presenting them on downtown Minneapolis streets for &quot;Twin City Takeover&quot;.

In 2023, the Guerrilla Girls were featured in the episode &quot;Bodies of Knowledge of the American streaming series , season 11., in which they presented a new body of work.

===Politics and social issues===
Although the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; protest art directed at the art world remains their most well-known work, throughout their existence the group has periodically targeted politicians, specifically conservative Republicans. Those criticized have included George Bush, Newt Gingrich, and most recently Michele Bachmann. In 1991, the Artist and Homeless Collaborative invited them to work with homeless women to create posters in response to homelessness and the first Gulf War. Between 1992 and 1994, Guerrilla Girl posters addressed the 1992 presidential election, reproductive rights (done for the march on Washington in 1992), gay and lesbian rights, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. During the 2012 election, they displayed their &quot;Even Michele Bachman believes. ... &quot; on a billboard adjacent to a football stadium to advertise her plan to: ban same-sex marriages, require voter ID checks, and spend money implementing statewide voter IDs. Their 2013 posters discussed the Homeland Terror Alert system and Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign.

In 2016, the Guerrilla Girls launched the &quot;President Trump Announces New Commemorative Months&quot; campaign in the form of stickers and posters, which they distributed during the Women&#x27;s March on Washington in Los Angeles and New York City, as well as the J20 event at the Whitney Museum of Art and the Fire Fink protest at MoMA.

==Work: publications and merchandise==

To shed light on inequality in the art world, the Guerrilla Girls have published numerous books. In 1995, they published their first book, &quot;Confessions of the Guerrilla Girls&quot;, a compilation of 50 works plus a self-interview. In 1998, they published &quot;The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art&quot;, a consciousness-raising comic book that sold 82,000 copies, as it explores how art history&#x27;s male domination constrained several female artists&#x27; careers. In 2003, they published &quot;Bitches, Bimbos and Ballbreakers&quot;, a down and dirty catalogue of &quot;The Top Stereotypes from Cradle to Grave&quot;. Offering thumbnail histories for cultural clichés ranging from &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girl&quot;, &quot;the Girl Next Door&quot;, &quot;the Bimbo/Dumb Blonde&quot; to &quot;the Bitch/Ballbreaker&quot;, each is given &quot;trademark Guerrilla Girl treatment: pointed factoids and cool graphics&quot;.

Their 2004 book &quot;The Guerrilla Girl&#x27;s Museum Activity Book&quot; (reissued in 2012) parodies children&#x27;s museum activity books. Meant to teach children how to both appreciate and critique museums, this book provides activities that reveal the problematic aspects of museum culture and major museum collections. In 2009, they produced a history of hysteria, &quot;The Hysterical Herstory Of Hysteria And How It Was Cured From Ancient Times Until Now&quot;. MFC-Michèle Didier published it in 2016.

==Presentations==
An important part of Guerrilla Girls&#x27; outreach since 1985 has been presentations and workshops at colleges, universities, art organizations, and sometimes at museums. The presentations, known as &quot;gigs&quot;, attract hundreds and sometimes thousands of attendees. In the gig, they play music, videos, show slides and talk about the history of their work, how it has evolved. In the end, the GGs interact with audience members. New work is always included and gig material changes all the time. They have done hundreds of these events and have traveled to nearly every state as well as Europe, South America, and Australia.

In recognition of their work, the Guerrilla Girls have been invited to give talks at world-renowned museums, including a presentation at the MoMA&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Feminist Futures&quot; Symposium. They have also been invited to speak at art schools and universities across the globe and gave a 2010 commencement speech at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
To mark the 30th anniversary of the Guerrilla Girls, Matadero Madrid hosted &quot;Guerrilla Girls: 1985-2015&quot;, an exhibition featuring most of the collective&#x27;s production accompanied by a series of events including a talk/performance by Guerrilla Girl members Frida Kahlo and Käthe Kollwitz. The exhibition also showed the 1992 documentary &quot;Guerrilla in Our Midst&quot; by Amy Harrison.

Three Guerrilla Girls appeared on the Stephen Colbert show on January 14, 2016.

==Controversies==
===Diversity===
Despite having routinely challenged art institutions to display more artists of color, both members and critics want the Guerrilla Girls to be more diverse. Their art was believed to be exclusive to white feminism and they addressed by creating a series of activist artworks addressing a range of issues that women faced. &quot;Zora Neale Hurston&quot; recalls Guerrilla Girl membership as &quot;mostly white&quot; and largely mirroring the art world demographics that they critiqued. Despite sporting gorilla masks to downplay personal identity, some members attribute Guerrilla Girl interests to the fact that de facto leaders &quot;Frida Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Käthe Kollwitz&quot; are both white. (&quot;Frida Kahlo&quot; has also been criticized for her appropriation of a Latina artist&#x27;s name.) The artist believed in the overt artistic expression by correlating beauty and pain, along with the rise of modernism. An art movement without generalization.

However, any precise information on the demographics of the Guerrilla Girls is impossible, for they have &quot;staunchly, and problematically, resisted being surveyed as to the makeup of their own membership&quot;.

Several Guerrilla Girls who are people of color have faced numerous challenges. Despite the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; stance against tokenism, some artists of color abandoned Guerrilla Girl membership due to tokenism, silencing, disrespect, and whitewashing. As a woman of color, &quot;Alma Thomas&quot; describes having felt uncomfortable wearing the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; signature gorilla mask. &quot;Thomas&quot; recalls little effort being devoted to understanding the challenges of artists of color. &quot;Their whiteness was such that they ... didn&#x27;t understand that blacks were being put in a completely separate world in the art world, that black male artists and black female artists are completely separated, completely segregated to this day.&quot; Ultimately, this widespread antagonism led to many &quot;artists of color [leaving] after a few meetings because they could sense the unspoken hierarchy in the group&quot;.

=== Second-wave feminism and essentialism ===
Emerging at the tail end of the second-wave feminist movement, the Guerrilla Girls navigated the differences between established and emerging feminist theory during the 1980s. &quot;Alma Thomas&quot; describes this grey-area that the Guerrilla Girls occupied as &quot;universalist feminism&quot;, bordering on essentialism. Art historian Anna Chave considers the Guerrilla Girls&#x27; essentialism much more profound, leading the group to be &quot;assailed by ... a rising generation of women wise in the ways of poststructuralist theory, for [their] putative naiveté and susceptibility to essentialism&quot;. Essentialist views are most clearly exhibited in two Guerrilla Girl books:&quot;The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art&quot; (1998) and the controversial &quot;Estrogen Bomb&quot; (2003–13) campaign. Regarding the former, &quot;Alma Thomas&quot; worried that &quot;The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art&quot; &quot;was so embedded in that second-wave feminist and even pre-second-wave essentialism&quot; that it fulfilled some assumption that all women artists are feminist artists.

Students at Minneapolis College of Art and Design criticized their &quot;Estrogen Bomb&quot; poster campaign, describing it as insensitive towards transgender people since it ties the female gender to estrogen, the same sort of essentialist link the Guerrilla Girls aim to critique. Aside from essentialism, the Guerrilla Girls have also been critiqued for failing to integrate intersectionality into their work.

=== Internal disputes ===
Leading up to a highly publicized 2003 lawsuit, there was increasing animosity toward &quot;Frida Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Käthe Kollwitz&quot;. Despite founding members&#x27; initial intention to create a non-hierarchal, equitable power structure, there was an increasing sense that two people were making &quot;the final decisions no matter what you said&quot;. Several Guerrilla Girls felt that their second book, &quot;The Guerrilla Girls Bedside Companion to the History of Western Art&quot;, primarily represented the views of &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot;. Some even felt that &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; completely controlled the book, despite their having selected material created collectively by all Guerrilla Girls. There was even suspicion that these two not only claimed all the credit but took all of the profits. Some members condemned the book as &quot;undemocratic and ... against the spirit of the [Guerrilla] Girls&quot;.
As the Guerilla Girls gained in popularity, tensions led to what the Girls later called the &quot;banana split&quot;, as five members actually split from the collective. Soon after several members stepped aside to form Guerrilla Girls Broadband, &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; moved to trademark the name &quot;Guerrilla Girls, Inc.&quot; to distinguish their realm from those of Guerrilla Girls BroadBand and Guerrilla Girls On Tour! whose focus is discrimination in the theater world. Even though their former colleague &quot;Gertrude Stein&quot; was in the on-tour group, &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; charged them with copyright and trademark infringement and unjust enrichment. Many members of the group felt especially betrayed that &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; had launched their lawsuit under their real names, Jerilea Zempel and Erika Rothenberg.

This prompted negative reactions from both current and former Guerrilla Girls, who objected to &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; claiming responsibility for having created the collective effort, as well as the flippancy with which they exchanged their anonymity for legal standing.

Judge Louis L. Stanton, who handled the case, rejected the &quot;bizarre&quot; suggestion that defendants sporting gorilla masks be allowed to testify in his courtroom. He also stated that &quot;Mundane court procedures for adjudicating legal rights and the ownership of property require direct and cross-examination of real persons with real addresses and attributes.&quot;

In their 45-page complaint, &quot;Kahlo&quot; and &quot;Kollwitz&quot; described themselves as the group&#x27;s &quot;guiding forces&quot;, even though the Guerrilla Girls were &quot;informally organized, [and] had no official hierarchy&quot;. Initially, they asked the court to stop Guerrilla Girls Broadband from calling themselves Guerrilla Girls and sought millions of dollars in damages. In 2006, they settled with the theatre group who agreed to go by Guerrilla Girls on Tour. As of 2013, three separate groups remained active, the GuerrillaGirlsBroadBand, Inc., Guerrilla Girls On Tour, Inc. (the Theatre Girls), and Guerrilla Girls, Inc. The Guerrilla Girls BroadBand focuses on the internet as its &quot;natural habitat&quot;.
=== Selling out ===
Upon their 1985 debut, the Guerrilla Girls were &quot;lauded by the very establishment they sought to undermine&quot;. They have since exhibited at Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Centre Pompidou, and MoMA, which additionally grants them a broader audience for their concerns. Since then, this relationship has only intensified, as the Guerrilla Girls presented their exhibitions in museums and even allowed their works to be collected by hegemonic institutions. Although some have questioned the efficacy, if not hypocrisy, of the group&#x27;s working within the system that they originally denigrated, few would challenge their decision to let the Getty Research Institute house their archives.

==Members and names==

Membership in the New York City group is exclusive, by invitation only, based on relationships with current and past members, and one&#x27;s involvement in the contemporary art world. A mentoring program was formed within the group, pairing a new member with an experienced Guerrilla Girl to bring them into the fold. Due to the lack of formality, the group is comfortable with individuals outside of their base claiming to be Guerrilla Girls; Guerrilla Girl 1 stated in a 2007 interview: &quot;It can only enhance us by having people of power who have been given credit for being a Girl, even if they were never a Girl.&quot; Men are not allowed to become Guerrilla Girls but may support the group by assisting in promotional activities.

Guerrilla Girls&#x27; names are generally based on dead female artists. Members go by names such as Käthe Kollwitz, Alma Thomas, Rosalba Carriera, Frida Kahlo, Alice Neel, Julia de Burgos, and Hannah Höch. Guerrilla Girls&#x27; &quot;Carriera&quot; is credited with the idea of using pseudonyms as a way to not forget female artists. Having read about Rosalba Carriera in a footnote of &quot;Letters on Cézanne&quot; by Rainer Maria Rilke, she decided to pay tribute to the little-known female artist with her name. This also helped to solve the problem of media interviews; the group was often interviewed by phone and would not give names, causing problems and confusion amongst the group and the media. Guerrilla Girl 1 joined in the late 1980s, taking on her name as a way to memorialize women in the art community who have fallen under the radar and did not make as notable as an impact as the names takes on by other members. For some members like &quot;Zora Neale Hurston&quot;, or Emma Amos, identities have only been made public posthumously.

==Gorilla symbolism==

The idea to adopt the gorilla as the group&#x27;s symbol stemmed from a spelling error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group&#x27;s name at a meeting as &quot;gorilla&quot;. Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as a group symbol might have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group&#x27;s overall message in several key ways.

To begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with King Kong, or other images of trapped and tamed apes. In the 2010 SAIC Commencement, the comparison between institutionalized artists and tamed apes was explicitly made:

 And last, but not least, be a great ape. In 1917, Franz Kafka wrote a short story titled &quot;A Report to an Academy&quot;, in which an ape spoke about what it was like to be taken into captivity by a bunch of educated, intellectual types. The published story ends with the ape tamed and broken by the stultified academics. But in an earlier draft, Kafka tells a different story. The ape ends his report by instructing other apes NOT to allow themselves to be tamed. He says instead: break the bars of your cages, bite a hole through them, squeeze through an opening ... and ask yourself where do YOU want to go

The gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female odalisque body, and the large, snarling gorilla head. The addition of the head detracts from the male gaze and changes the way in which viewers are able to look at or understand the highly sexualized image. Further, the addition of the gorilla questions and modifies stereotypical notions of female beauty within Western art and popular culture, another stated goal of the Guerrilla Girls.

Guerrilla Girls, who wear the masks of big, hairy, powerful jungle creatures whose beauty is hardly conventional ... believe all animals, large and small, are beautiful in their own way.

Though this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of &quot;ars simia naturae&quot; (&quot;art the ape of nature&quot;) maintains that the job of art is to &quot;ape&quot;, or faithfully copy and represent nature. This was an idea first popularized by Renaissance thinker Giovanni Boccaccio who alleged that &quot;the artist in imitating nature only follows Nature&#x27;s own command&quot;.

==Legacy==

The group Ridykeulous overwrote the 1988 Gorilla Girls&#x27; poster &quot;The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist&quot; with their own messages in 2007.

<text>Thirteen vessels of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot;, after the Mohawk, an indigenous tribe of North America:

* was a 6-gun sloop launched at Oswego on the Great Lakes in 1756; the French seized her and seven other vessels of the Canadian Great Lakes Squadron when Fort Oswego surrendered to General Montcalm that same year.

* HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; was a Massachusetts privateer launched in 1781 that captured in 1782 and that the Royal Navy briefly took into service, before selling her in 1783. She then became a slaver and merchant vessel, before becoming a British privateer in 1797. The French captured her in the Mediterranean in 1801 and she served the French Navy until she was sold at Toulon in 1814.
* was a schooner listed in 1795 and operating on the Great Lakes out of Kingston, Ontario. She was condemned in 1803.
* HMS &quot;Mowhawk&quot; was a sloop listed in 1798. Nothing more is known of her.
* HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; was the American navy&#x27;s 12-gun brig &quot;Viper&quot;, formerly the USS &quot;Ferret&quot;, that was captured on 17 January 1813. She was sold in 1814. 
* HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; was to have been an 18-gun but she was renamed before being launched in 1813. She was sold in 1832.
* was a paddle-vessel launched in 1843 and sold in 1852.
* was a wooden screw gunvessel launched in 1856. She was sold in 1862 to the Emperor of China and renamed &quot;Pekin&quot;.

<doc id="476228" wikidata="Q2916974" url="?curid=476228" title="Regression fallacy">
<text>The regression (or regressive) fallacy is an informal fallacy. It assumes that something has returned to normal because of corrective actions taken while it was abnormal. This fails to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of the post hoc fallacy.

==Explanation==
Things like golf scores, the earth&#x27;s temperature, and chronic back pain fluctuate naturally and usually regress toward the mean. The logical flaw is to make predictions that expect exceptional results to continue as if they were average (see Representativeness heuristic). People are most likely to take action when variance is at its peak. Then after results become more normal they believe that their action was the cause of the change when in fact it was not causal.

This use of the word &quot;regression&quot; was coined by Sir Francis Galton in a study from 1885 called &quot;Regression Toward Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature&quot;. He showed that the height of children from very short or very tall parents would move toward the average. In fact, in any situation where two variables are less than perfectly correlated, an exceptional score on one variable may not be matched by an equally exceptional score on the other variable. The imperfect correlation between parents and children (height is not entirely heritable) means that the distribution of heights of their children will be centered somewhere between the average of the parents and the average of the population as whole. Thus, any single child can be more extreme than the parents, but the odds are against it.

==Examples==
When his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little. Therefore, he benefited from the doctor&#x27;s treatment.

The pain subsiding a little after it has gotten worse is more easily explained by regression toward the mean. Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.

The student did exceptionally poorly last semester, so I punished him. He did much better this semester. Clearly, punishment is effective in improving students&#x27; grades.

Often exceptional performances are followed by more normal performances, so the change in performance might better be explained by regression toward the mean. Incidentally, some experiments have shown that people may develop a systematic bias for punishment and against reward because of reasoning analogous to this example of the regression fallacy.

The frequency of accidents on a road fell after a speed camera was installed. Therefore, the speed camera has improved road safety.

Speed cameras are often installed after a road incurs an exceptionally high number of accidents, and this value usually falls (regression to mean) immediately afterward. Many speed camera proponents attribute this fall in accidents to the speed camera, without observing the overall trend.

Some authors use the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover jinx as an example of a regression effect: extremely good performances are likely to be followed by less extreme ones, and athletes are chosen to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; only after extreme performances. Attributing this to a &quot;jinx&quot; rather than regression, as some athletes reportedly believe, is an example of committing the regression fallacy.

==Misapplication==
On the other hand, dismissing valid explanations can lead to a worse situation. For example:
After the Western Allies invaded Normandy, creating a second major front, German control of Europe waned. Clearly, the combination of the Western Allies and the USSR drove the Germans back.

&quot;Fallacious evaluation:&quot; &quot;Given that the counterattacks against Germany occurred only after they had conquered the greatest amount of territory under their control, regression toward the mean can explain the retreat of German forces from occupied territories as a purely random fluctuation that would have happened without any intervention on the part of the USSR or the Western Allies.&quot; However, this was not the case. The reason is that political power and occupation of territories is not primarily determined by random events, making the concept of regression toward the mean inapplicable (on the large scale).

In essence, misapplication of regression toward the mean can reduce all events to a just-so story, without cause or effect. (Such misapplication takes as a premise that all events are random, as they must be for the concept of regression toward the mean to be validly applied.)

Schwartz was a lifelong Democrat. According to NBC News, he was the largest single contributor to the Democratic Party from 1992 to 1996. In 1996, he celebrated his 71st birthday with Bill and Hillary Clinton at the White House. In 1998 Schwartz became embroiled in a campaign donations scandal and an alleged transfer of missile technology to China that occurred in 1996. He was exonerated of any wrongdoing in the campaign finance matter after a Justice Department investigation. Loral settled the missile transfer matter with the Justice Department in 2002, paying a $14 million fine and admitting no wrongdoing.

In 2016, Schwartz donated US$1 million to Priorities USA Action, a Super PAC supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Schwartz is also in the $5 million – $10 million bracket of donors to the Clinton Foundation.

<text>Steven Hillel Paikin (born June 9, 1960) is a Canadian journalist, author, and documentary producer. Paikin has primarily worked for TVOntario (TVO), Ontario&#x27;s public broadcaster, and is anchor of TVO&#x27;s flagship current affairs program &quot;The Agenda with Steve Paikin&quot;.

==Early life and education==
A native of Hamilton, Ontario, Paikin was born to Lawrence Sidney (Larry) Paikin, a manufacturer and owner of Ennis-Paikin Steel Ltd., and Marina Suzanne (Marnie) Sibulash. Marnie Paikin was invested a Member of the Order of Canada in 1999 for her work in education and health policy. She was also chair of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and of the Ontario Council on University Affairs. Paikin is Jewish.

Paikin graduated from Hillfield Strathallan College in 1978 and continued to university where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto (Victoria University, Toronto 1981). Later, Paikin received his master&#x27;s degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University. He served as sports editor for the University of Toronto&#x27;s independent weekly, &quot;The Newspaper&quot;, while pursuing his BA, and was the play-by-play voice of the Varsity Blues hockey and football teams on U of T Radio.

==Career==
Paikin was an anchor and Queen&#x27;s Park correspondent for CBC Television&#x27;s Toronto station CBLT-TV, and host of a daily news and current affairs program on CBC Newsworld. He also held reporting jobs in private radio and print media, including the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; and Toronto radio station CHFI, where he was Toronto City Hall reporter from 1982–85.

In 1992, Paikin began work at TVO, hosting the political series &quot;Between the Lines&quot; until 1994. He also co-created the Queen&#x27;s Park magazine &quot;Fourth Reading&quot;, which he hosted for 14 years. In 1994, Paikin began co-hosting duties (with Mary Hynes for two years, and then Paula Todd) on &quot;Studio 2&quot; until 2006. In 1998, he co-created and began hosting &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;, a weekly foreign affairs commentary show.
In 2006, TVO cancelled &quot;Studio 2&quot; and replaced it with a new program, &quot;The Agenda with Steve Paikin&quot;. 

Paikin frequently is selected to be the moderator of election debates. He acted as a moderator for federal leaders debates in 2006, 2008, and 2011; and for Ontario provincial leaders debates in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2022. Leaders&#x27; Debates Commission chose Paikin to serve as the moderator for the English-language federal leaders&#x27; debate for the 45th Canadian federal election.

Aside from his hosting and journalistic endeavors, Paikin has produced a number of feature-length documentaries: &quot;Return to the Warsaw Ghetto&quot;; &quot;A Main Street Man&quot;; &quot;Balkan Madness&quot;; &quot;Teachers, Tories and Turmoil&quot;; and &quot;Chairman of the Board: The Life and Death of John Robarts&quot;. For 1993&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Warsaw Ghetto&quot;, Paikin won the &quot;Silver Screen Award&quot; at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival, and received awards at the Yorkton Film Festival in Saskatchewan and at China&#x27;s Shanghai Film Festival.

In February 2012, Paikin was named the Queen&#x27;s Park journalist with the most Twitter influence in a study conducted by PR agency Hill+Knowlton Strategies.

He holds honorary doctorates from McMaster University, Victoria University, Laurentian University, York University, and honorary diplomas from Humber College, Centennial College, Mohawk College and Fanshawe College. He was later appointed chancellor of Laurentian University in Sudbury in October 2013, a position which was terminated following the university&#x27;s restructuring amidst financial difficulties in 2021. In December 2013, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and invested into the Order of Ontario.

==Personal life==

Paikin is married to Canadian health care lobbyist Francesca Grosso, author of &quot;Navigating Canada&#x27;s Health Care System&quot; and a former director of policy for then-Ontario health minister Tony Clement. Grosso was subsequently health policy advisor to Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader Patrick Brown and was the ghostwriter of his memoirs.
One of his sons, Zach Paikin, is a former Liberal Party activist. Another son, Henry Paikin, once worked for Senator Frances Lankin.

He is a cousin to the late Dr. Harry Paikin, a Hamilton school trustee for 30 years who was a Labor-Progressive Party candidate for the Ontario legislature in the 1945 Ontario election. Another cousin, Harold Paikin, was mayor of Waterloo from 1958-59. Another cousin, Carol Paikin Miller, was a Hamilton school trustee and married to former NDP MPP Paul Miller.

Steve Paikin is a supporter of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Red Sox, and Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

<text>Lanthionine is a nonproteinogenic amino acid with the chemical formula (HOOC-CH(NH2)-CH2-S-CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH). It is typically formed by a cysteine residue and a dehydrated serine residue. Despite its name, lanthionine does not contain the element lanthanum.

==Background==

In 1941, lanthionine was first isolated by treating wool with sodium carbonate. It was found to be a sulfur-containing amino acid; accordingly it was given the name lanthionine [wool (Latin: &quot;Lana&quot;), sulfur (Greek: &quot;theîon&quot;)]. Lanthionine was first synthesized by alkylation of cysteine with β-chloroalanine. Lanthionines are found widely in nature. They have been isolated from human hair, lactalbumin, and feathers. Lanthionines have also been found in bacterial cell walls and are the components of a group of gene-encoded peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes nisin (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (effective against &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor).

==Preparation==

A variety of syntheses of lanthionine have been published including sulfur extrusion from cystine, ring opening of serine β-lactone, and hetero-conjugate addition of cysteine to dehydroalanine. The sulfur extrusion method is, however, the only pathway for lanthionine that has been employed in the total synthesis of a lantibiotic.

Biosynthesis of the lanthionine bridge in peptidic natural products can be accomplished through a number of different pathways. For example, the lanthionine bridges in the antibiotic nisin are the result of a dedicated dehydratase (NisB) and a dedicated cyclase (NisC).

<text>David Frank Paich (born June 25, 1954) is an American keyboardist, singer, and songwriter, best known as the co-founder, principal songwriter, keyboardist, and secondary vocalist of the rock band Toto since 1977. He wrote or co-wrote much of Toto&#x27;s original material, including the band&#x27;s three most popular songs: &quot;Hold the Line&quot;, &quot;Rosanna&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot;. With Toto, Paich has contributed to 17 albums and sold over 40 million records. He and guitarist and singer Steve Lukather are the only members to appear on every studio album.

In addition, Paich has worked as a songwriter, session musician, and producer with a host of artists including Helen Reddy, Boz Scaggs, and Michael Jackson.

Paich is the son of jazz composer, musician, and arranger Marty Paich.

== Career ==
=== Toto ===
A prolific writer of chart-performing songs (13 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100), Paich wrote or co-wrote such tracks as &quot;Miss Sun&quot;, &quot;Got To Be Real&quot;, &quot;Georgy Porgy&quot;, &quot;99&quot;, &quot;Lowdown&quot;, &quot;Lido Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Lady Love Me (One More Time)&quot;(George Benson), &quot;Hold the Line&quot;, &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Hydra&quot;, &quot;Holyanna&quot;, and &quot;Pamela&quot;. He also performed lead vocals on the Toto hits &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Lovers in the Night&quot;, and &quot;Stranger in Town&quot;.

Paich remained with Toto from the beginning of the band in 1977 until 2004, then performed on only a few shows until their disbandment in 2008. Session keyboardist Greg Phillinganes joined Toto in 2003 as an additional keyboardist for both studio projects and tour dates. In 2010, Paich resumed performing with Toto, and until mid-2018 was one of the band&#x27;s keyboard players, alongside fellow original member Steve Porcaro.

With Toto in between legs of its 2018 40 Trips Around the Sun (40th anniversary) tour, the band announced via its official website on July 20, 2018, that Paich &quot;will not be performing on the band&#x27;s planned North American tour [lasting from July 30-November 17]. The recent European appearances [February 11-April 8] took a toll on his personal well-being... He plans on focusing on his health, and looks forward to returning to the road when ready to do so.&quot; 
Guitarist Steve Lukather later stated that Paich&#x27;s absence stemmed partially from an apparent seizure he suffered on the bus during the band&#x27;s early 2018 European tour.

Paich returned to the stage with Toto for the opening and closing shows of their 2019 US tour, reportedly their last, on September 20 in Los Angeles and October 20 in Philadelphia. In both instances, Paich joined the band at the end of the show to play keyboards and sing on &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. The band dissolved at the end of the tour, however, before he could make a full return. Toto reformed in 2020 with Lukather and singer Joseph Williams fronting a new band. Paich is no longer able to tour full-time, but remains a member of the band as its musical director and a guest performer whenever his health allows. David made a guest appearance in Amsterdam, the 15th of July 2022 for 5 songs only.

=== Session and side projects ===
He has co-writing credits with Boz Scaggs on the songs &quot;What Can I Say&quot;, &quot;Lowdown&quot;, and &quot;Lido Shuffle&quot; from the multi-platinum album &quot;Silk Degrees&quot;, and occasionally still sits in on keyboards with Boz Scaggs&#x27; band. As songwriter he wrote or co-wrote songs for Cher, The Jacksons, Andy Williams, George Benson, Glen Campbell, Boz Scaggs, Jon Anderson (Yes), Cherie &amp; Marie Currie, and Chicago. As arranger he worked for Michael Jackson, Rod Stewart, Patti Austin, Donna Summer, the Doobie Brothers, Sheryl Crow and many more.

In 1977, Paich produced the No. 1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Break It to Me Gently&quot; by Aretha Franklin.In the early and mid-1980s, Paich often worked with well-known producers Quincy Jones and David Foster. Paich was a part of the session group on the Michael Jackson album &quot;Thriller&quot;. He played piano, synthesizer, and did some synth and rhythm arrangements.

In 1982, Paich produced and arranged the song &quot;It&#x27;s A Long Road&quot; for the film &quot;First Blood&quot;.

In 1989, Paich produced and arranged the Oscar-nominated song &quot;The Girl Who Used to Be Me&quot;, written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman, for the film &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; and produced the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Holding On&quot;, written by Hans Zimmer and Will Jennings, for the film &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

In 1994, Paich was a producer on the Tramaine Hawkins album &quot;To a Higher Place&quot; which was nominated for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album in the 37th Annual Grammy Awards.

In October 2009, David Paich was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame along with the other members of Toto.

Paich was the Co-Music Director for President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Foundation Concert in 2011. That year Paich also performed on the all-star benefit album entitled Jazz For Japan (Avatar Records).

David was the music coordinator for 2012 Music Cares Person of the Year, Paul McCartney.

For his extraordinary contributions to the world of music, David Paich was honored with the 2013 South-South Award for Lifetime Cultural Achievement.

As a session musician, Paich has played on numerous soundtracks and on albums by many artists, including Elkie Brooks&#x27; album &quot;Rich Man&#x27;s Woman&quot;; Bryan Adams&#x27; song &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;; the Michael Jackson songs &quot;Earth Song&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, &quot;Heal the World&quot;, &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;, and &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;; and the USA for Africa song &quot;We Are the World&quot;, as well as work with Aretha Franklin, Boz Scaggs, Quincy Jones, Melanie Safka, Don Henley, Diana Ross, the Doobie Brothers, Neil Diamond, Seals and Crofts, Steely Dan, Elton John, Joe Cocker, Rod Stewart, Cher, Sarah Vaughan, Randy Newman, Tina Turner, the Brothers Johnson and Pink.

Paich traveled to China, where he worked composing the theme music for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2009, he sang the hit song &quot;Africa&quot; at the Millennium Development Goals awards in New York and co-produced a new tune for George Benson. Paich was involved with the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards as a music producer and keyboardist for the on-stage band.

=== Solo career ===

In 2022, Paich announced his debut solo album titled &quot;Forgotten Toys&quot;. It was released by The Players Club (Mascot Label Group) on August 19, 2022. On June 9, 2022, he released the first single titled &quot;Spirit of the Moonrise,&quot; followed by July 14&#x27;s &quot;Queen Charade.&quot;

Paich has said he plans to release more solo music in the future and he has &quot;some stuff lying around here&quot;, and is often &quot;slow&quot; because he is &quot;methodical and a perfectionist, sometimes too much...&quot;.

== Personal life ==

David Paich was born in Los Angeles, California to Hilda Lorraine Paich and Martin Louis Paich. He had one sister, Lorraine Louise Paich Cohen, who died on December 20, 2010, at age 58. She was a survivor of a double lung transplant that took place in November 2006, and Paich took a leave of absence from Toto in 2003–2008 to help care for her. She has three credits on albums her brother David was involved in. These include two production credits, one from the 1978 Cheryl Lynn self-titled debut album David produced, and one from the 1981 Sarah Vaughan album titled &quot;Songs Of The Beatles&quot;. She was also credited as providing vocals on the Toto song &quot;Struck By Lightning&quot; from their 2018 studio album &quot;Old Is New&quot;. His mother, Hilda, died in 1979, and his father, Marty, died on August 12, 1995. He married his wife, Lorraine, in 1984 and they have one daughter together named Elizabeth, who was born on November 4, 1989.
