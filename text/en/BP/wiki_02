<text>The Sallen–Key topology is an electronic filter topology used to implement second-order active filters that is particularly valued for its simplicity. It is a degenerate form of a voltage-controlled voltage-source (VCVS) filter topology. It was introduced by R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key of MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1955.

==Explanation of operation==
A VCVS filter uses a voltage amplifier with practically infinite input impedance and zero output impedance to implement a 2-pole low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, bandstop, or allpass response. The VCVS filter allows high Q factor and passband gain without the use of inductors. A VCVS filter also has the advantage of independence: VCVS filters can be cascaded without the stages affecting each others tuning. A Sallen–Key filter is a variation on a VCVS filter that uses a unity gain amplifier (i.e., a buffer amplifier).

==History and implementation==
In 1955, Sallen and Key used vacuum tube cathode follower amplifiers; the cathode follower is a reasonable approximation to an amplifier with unity voltage gain. Modern analog filter implementations may use operational amplifiers (also called &quot;op amps&quot;). Because of its high input impedance and easily selectable gain, an operational amplifier in a conventional non-inverting configuration is often used in VCVS implementations. Implementations of Sallen–Key filters often use an op amp configured as a voltage follower; however, emitter or source followers are other common choices for the buffer amplifier.

== Sensitivity to component tolerances==
VCVS filters are relatively resilient to component tolerance, but obtaining high Q factor may require extreme component value spread or high amplifier gain. Higher-order filters can be obtained by cascading two or more stages.

==Generic Sallen–Key topology==

The generic unity-gain Sallen–Key filter topology implemented with a unity-gain operational amplifier is shown in Figure 1. The following analysis is based on the assumption that the operational amplifier is ideal.

Because the op amp is in a negative-feedback configuration, its formula_1 and formula_2 inputs must match (i.e., formula_3). However, the inverting input formula_2 is connected directly to the output formula_5, and so

By Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law (KCL) applied at the formula_6 node,

{Z_3} + \frac{v_x - v_-}{Z_2}.&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

By combining equations (1) and (2),

:formula_7

Applying equation (1) and KCL at the op amp&#x27;s non-inverting input formula_1 gives

:formula_9

which means that

Combining equations (2) and (3) gives

{Z_3} + \frac{v_\text{out} \left( \frac{Z_2}{Z_4} + 1 \right) - v_\text{out}}{Z_2}.&lt;/math&gt;|4}}

Rearranging equation (4) gives the transfer function

{v_\text{in}} = \frac{Z_3 Z_4}{Z_1 Z_2 + Z_3(Z_1 + Z_2) + Z_3 Z_4},&lt;/math&gt;|5}}

which typically describes a second-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system.

If the formula_10 component were connected to ground instead of to formula_5, the filter would be a voltage divider composed of the formula_12 and formula_10 components cascaded with another voltage divider composed of the formula_14 and formula_15 components. The buffer amplifier bootstraps the &quot;bottom&quot; of the formula_10 component to the output of the filter, which will improve upon the simple two-divider case. This interpretation is the reason why Sallen–Key filters are often drawn with the op amp&#x27;s non-inverting input below the inverting input, thus emphasizing the similarity between the output and ground.

===Branch impedances===

By choosing different passive components (e.g., resistors and capacitors) for formula_12, formula_14, formula_15, and formula_10, the filter can be made with low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass characteristics. In the examples below, recall that a resistor with resistance formula_21 has impedance formula_22 of
:formula_23
and a capacitor with capacitance formula_24 has impedance formula_25 of
:formula_26
where formula_27 (here formula_28 denotes the imaginary unit) is the complex angular frequency, and formula_29 is the frequency of a pure sine-wave input. That is, a capacitor&#x27;s impedance is frequency-dependent and a resistor&#x27;s impedance is not.

==Application: low-pass filter==

An example of a unity-gain low-pass configuration is shown in Figure 2.
An operational amplifier is used as the buffer here, although an emitter follower is also effective. This circuit is equivalent to the generic case above with

:formula_30

The transfer function for this second-order unity-gain low-pass filter is

:formula_31

where the undamped natural frequency formula_32, attenuation formula_33, Q factor formula_34, and damping ratio formula_35, are given by

:formula_36

and

:formula_37

So,

:formula_38

The formula_34 factor determines the height and width of the peak of the frequency response of the filter. As this parameter increases, the filter will tend to &quot;ring&quot; at a single resonant frequency near formula_32 (see &quot;LC filter&quot; for a related discussion).

===Poles and zeros===

This transfer function has no (finite) zeros and two poles located in the complex &quot;s&quot;-plane:

:formula_41

There are two zeros at infinity (the transfer function goes to zero for each of the formula_42 terms in the denominator).

=== Design choices===
A designer must choose the formula_34 and formula_32 appropriate for their application.
The formula_34 value is critical in determining the eventual shape.
For example, a second-order Butterworth filter, which has maximally flat passband frequency response, has a formula_34 of formula_47.
By comparison, a value of formula_48 corresponds to the series cascade of two identical simple low-pass filters.

Because there are 2 parameters and 4 unknowns, the design procedure typically fixes the ratio between both resistors as well as that between the capacitors. One possibility is to set the ratio between formula_49 and formula_50 as formula_51 versus formula_52 and the ratio between formula_53 and formula_54 as formula_55 versus formula_56. So,

:formula_57

As a result, the formula_32 and formula_34 expressions are reduced to

:formula_60

and

:formula_61

Starting with a more or less arbitrary choice for e.g. formula_24 and formula_51, the appropriate values for formula_21 and formula_55 can be calculated in favor of the desired formula_32 and formula_34. In practice, certain choices of component values will perform better than others due to the non-idealities of real operational amplifiers. As an example, high resistor values will increase the circuit&#x27;s noise production, whilst contributing to the DC offset voltage on the output of op amps equipped with bipolar input transistors.

===Example===
For example, the circuit in Figure 3 has formula_68 and formula_69. The transfer function is given by

:formula_70

and, after the substitution, this expression is equal to

:formula_71

which shows how every formula_72 combination comes with some formula_73 combination to provide the same formula_32 and formula_34 for the low-pass filter. A similar design approach is used for the other filters below.

=== Input impedance ===
The input impedance of the second-order unity-gain Sallen–Key low-pass filter is also of interest to designers. It is given by Eq. (3) in Cartwright and Kaminsky as

:formula_76

where formula_77 and formula_78.

Furthermore, for formula_79, there is a minimal value of the magnitude of the impedance, given by Eq. (16) of Cartwright and Kaminsky, which states that

:formula_80

Fortunately, this equation is well-approximated by

:formula_81

for formula_82. For formula_83 values outside of this range, the 0.34 constant has to be modified for minimal error.

Also, the frequency at which the minimal impedance magnitude occurs is given by Eq. (15) of Cartwright and Kaminsky, i.e.,

:formula_84

This equation can also be well approximated using Eq. (20) of Cartwright and Kaminsky, which states that

:formula_85

==Application: high-pass filter==

A second-order unity-gain high-pass filter with formula_86 and formula_69 is shown in Figure 4.

A second-order unity-gain high-pass filter has the transfer function

:formula_88

where undamped natural frequency formula_32 and formula_34 factor are discussed above in the low-pass filter discussion. The circuit above implements this transfer function by the equations

:formula_91

(as before) and

:formula_92

So

:formula_93

Follow an approach similar to the one used to design the low-pass filter above.

== Application: bandpass filter== 

An example of a non-unity-gain bandpass filter implemented with a VCVS filter is shown in Figure 5. Although it uses a different topology and an operational amplifier configured to provide non-unity-gain, it can be analyzed using similar methods as with the generic Sallen–Key topology. Its transfer function is given by

:formula_94

The center frequency formula_32 (i.e., the frequency where the magnitude response has its &quot;peak&quot;) is given by

:formula_96

The Q factor formula_34 is given by

:formula_98

The voltage divider in the negative feedback loop controls the &quot;inner gain&quot; formula_99 of the op amp:

:formula_100

If the inner gain formula_99 is too high, the filter will oscillate.

<doc id="466115" wikidata="Q3748695" url="?curid=466115" title="Fortean Society">
<text>The Fortean Society was a New York City-based society started in the United States in 1931 during a meeting held in the flat of American writer Charles Hoy Fort, in order to promote his ideas of Forteana.

Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort, who had helped to get his work published. Founding members of the Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott, and many of New York&#x27;s literati such as Dorothy Parker. Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Buckminster Fuller. But &quot;Fort had his share of detractors; his friend H. L. Mencken said his head was filled with &#x27;Bohemian mush.

The first six issues of the Fortean Society&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Doubt&quot;, were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser. Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues. Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society&#x27;s direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean. During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of &quot;Doubt&quot; to espouse his politics. He particularly opposed civil defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens. In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.

The &quot;Fortean Society Magazine&quot; (also called &quot;Doubt&quot;) was published regularly until Thayer&#x27;s death in Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1959, when the society went on hiatus and the magazine came to an end. Writers Paul and Ron Willis, publishers of &quot;Anubis&quot;, acquired most of the original Fortean Society material and revived the Fortean Society as the International Fortean Organization (INFO) in 1961. INFO continues to this day and went on to incorporate in 1965, publish &quot;The INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown&quot; for over 35 years and created the first conference dedicated to the work and spirit of Charles Fort, the annual FortFest.

The original magazine &quot;Doubt&quot; and society were not connected to the present-day magazine &quot;Fortean Times&quot;, created by a British Fortean and long-time correspondent to Paul Willis, Bob Rickard, who encouraged Willis to publish. Much of the Fortean Society material including material from Fort, Dreiser and Hecht, excepting many of the notes of Charles Fort which were donated to the New York Public Library as a collection, was incorporated into the International Fortean Organization (INFO).

<text>Edward Tsang &quot;Ed&quot; Lu (; born July 1, 1963) is an American physicist and former NASA astronaut. He flew on three Space Shuttle flights, and made an extended stay aboard the International Space Station.

In 2007, Lu retired from NASA to become the program manager of Google&#x27;s Advanced Projects Team. In 2002, while still at NASA, Lu co-founded the B612 Foundation, dedicated to protecting the Earth from asteroid strikes, later serving as its chairman. As of 2020, he is its executive director.

==Early life and education==
Lu was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, to a Taiwanese American family. His parents were immigrants from Taiwan. He was raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, and Webster, New York.

Lu attended R. L. Thomas High School, where he was a member of the wrestling team and graduated in 1980. After high school, Lu graduated from Cornell University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in electrical engineering and was a member of Pi Kappa Phi. He then earned a Master of Science (M.S.) and a Ph.D. in applied physics from Stanford University in 1989 as a fellow of the National Science Foundation. 

Lu became a specialist in solar physics and did postdoctoral work at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii before being selected for the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1994.

==NASA career==
Lu flew on Space Shuttle missions STS-84 in 1997 and STS-106 in 2000, in which he carried out a six-hour spacewalk to perform construction work on the International Space Station. Having been flight engineer on Soyuz TMA-2, Lu spent six months in space in 2003 as part of ISS Expedition 7, with cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko.

In July 2003, Lu and Malenchenko answered questions from students participating in Japan&#x27;s NASDA special educational event, where Ed Lu performed &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on an electronic piano for a student&#x27;s birthday in the live broadcast from space. He had demonstrated the difficulty of playing the piano instrument in space during a live in-orbit interview with CBS News and NASA TV video feed. Also on this ISS mission on 15 October 2003, Lu communicated with the crewman of China&#x27;s first crewed mission into space, Yang Liwei, flying aboard Shenzhou 5. Lu congratulated the Chinese for the achievement and said in &quot;Putonghua&quot;: &quot;Welcome to space. Have a safe journey&quot;. Malenchenko added: &quot;I love to have somebody else in space instead of (just) me and Ed&quot;.

While still employed at NASA, Lu co-founded the B612 Foundation along with former astronaut Rusty Schweickart and scientists Clark Chapman and Piet Hut. It has conducted two lines of related research to help detect asteroids that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means for asteroid deflection. The foundation&#x27;s current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, to be launched in 2017–2018. The Sentinel&#x27;s infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, will help identify asteroids and other near-Earth objects (NEOs) that pose a risk of collision with Earth.

== Magic trick in space==

While on the ISS, Lu teamed up with magician James Randi (founder of JREF) to perform a card trick in outer space. Randi asked Lu to (without looking) select a card from the middle of a brand new freshly shuffled deck of cards, turn it around and reinsert the card into the deck the opposite direction. Then place the deck of cards back into its box then take them out again and fan the cards to the camera. This same procedure was being done by Randi back on Earth at the JREF headquarters in front of witnesses from the Miami Herald. Both Randi and Lu successfully selected the same card, the seven of diamonds. The remaining cards were jettisoned for weight reasons before returning to Earth, but Lu smuggled the card home. The two cards complete with autographs are framed for public view at the JREF offices in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Randi asks Lu &quot;What are the odds that we would both choose the same card?&quot; Lu answers &quot;Knowing you and your tricky ways, the odds were one in one, because it&#x27;s a trick!&quot;

== Post-NASA career ==
On August 10, 2007, Lu announced he was retiring from NASA to work at Google.

In June 2010, Lu left Google and worked out of the Sunfire Offices. In September 2011, Lu joined Liquid Robotics as Chief of Innovative Applications, where his work includes outreach to promote new applications for ocean science, and in 2012, he joined Hover Inc. as its Chief Technology Officer.

On June 28, 2012, Lu, with Apollo 9 Astronaut Rusty Schweickart and G. Scott Hubbard, Astronautics professor at Stanford University announced plans to build and operate the first privately-funded deep space mission called Sentinel. Their non-profit B612 Foundation will launch an infrared space telescope in orbit around the Sun, where from a distance as great as from Earth, where it would detect and track asteroids and other near-Earth objects posing threats to the planet. On October 25, 2016 B612 and Lu endorsed NASA&#x27;s NEOcam proposed mission and ended the Sentinel project.

As of 2022, Lu is working on a new project to find &quot;killer asteroids&quot; by analyzing terabytes of archived data. So far, the B612 Foundation, cofounded by Lu, has found over 100 new potentially-threatening asteroids. This immense number-crunching effort is supported in part by Google&#x27;s applied artificial intelligence project.

==Personal life==
Lu is married and has two children.

<text>Alberto de Angelis (1885–1965) was an Italian historian and musicologist, mostly remembered for writing a biography of composer and choir master Domenico Mustafà. The book, entitled &quot;Domenico Mustafa – La Cappella Sistina e la Società Musicale Romana&quot;, was published in 1926, and is considered of significant importance for its valuable account of Mustafa&#x27;s life, the musical society in Rome, and castrati singers at the Capella Sistina.

<text>The Social Register is a semi-annual publication in the United States that indexes the members of American high society. First published in the 1880s by newspaper columnist Louis Keller, it was later acquired by Malcolm Forbes. Since 2014, it has been owned by Christopher Wolf. 

It was historically a directory of &quot;old money&quot;, well-connected families from the Northeastern United States. In recent years, membership has diversified both in the geography and ethnicity of those it lists.

==History==

In antebellum New York City, the social elite was still a small enough group that no formal method of tracking individuals was necessary. With the advent of the Gilded Age, fashionable ladies began the practice of leaving calling cards at the homes of other notable women whom they visited. These cards would be cataloged into &quot;visiting lists&quot;. 

In 1887, Louis Keller, a newspaper society columnist and golf promoter, compiled the names of those on the visiting lists of the most prominent New York women into a published volume titled the &quot;Social Register&quot;. Inclusion in the registry was done under the supervision of an anonymous advisory committee, composed of some of those listed. This first edition of the &quot;Social Register&quot; listed more than 5,000 people, most of whom were descended from early American settler families. Joseph Pulitzer was the only Jew to be listed, and people from new money were generally not included. The register, it has been noted, was very much a product of Gilded Age excess.

By World War I, the &quot;Social Register&quot; had expanded into a multi-volume annual which included listings of Society members in 26 U.S. cities. Following Keller&#x27;s death in 1924, the &quot;Social Register&quot; passed to several of his heirs. In 1926, a single city edition cost $6.00 and the full set of American editions cost $50.00 .

A 1973 column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about that year&#x27;s &quot;Social Register&quot; observed that – unlike males listed – the volume did not list the universities attended by females, unless they were students: &quot;The fact that Mazie Cox is a 1967 graduate of Smith is not mentioned, although pains are taken to indicate that she is a member of the Colony Club, the Daughters of the Cincinnati and the Colonial Dames of America.&quot; It also noted that married women who chose to retain their maiden names would be listed under the surname of their husband regardless.

In 1976, the &quot;Social Register&quot; was acquired by Malcolm Forbes. In 1977, he re-consolidated the various city books back into a single volume for the whole of the United States. A study of the 1988 &quot;Social Register&quot; found that approximately 10 percent of those listed resided in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan, with the Upper East Side zip code of 10021 hosting the greatest concentration of listed persons.

The Forbes family retained ownership of the &quot;Social Register&quot; until 2014, when it was sold to Christopher R. Wolf, a &quot;longtime, listed member&quot;.

===Significance===
Inclusion in the &quot;Social Register&quot; has historically been limited to members of &quot;&quot;, members of the American upper class and The Establishment, and/or those of &quot;old money&quot; or White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) families, within the &quot;Social Register&quot; cities. According to McNamee and Miller: &quot;the acronym WASP... is exemplified by the &quot;Social Register&quot;, a list of prominent upper-class families first compiled in 1887... There is great continuity across generations among the names included in these volumes.&quot; 

The cities included are Newport, Rhode Island; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Los Angeles; New York; New Jersey; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Portland, Oregon; Providence; San Francisco; Seattle; St. Louis; and Washington, D.C.; as well as ones for &quot;Southern Cities&quot;. In European countries, similar directories for the perceived upper class, such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; and &quot;Landed Gentry&quot; in the United Kingdom, or the &quot;Carnet Mondain&quot; and &quot;High Life&quot; in Belgium, have been published for centuries.

According to the &quot;Robb Report&quot;, inclusion in the &quot;Social Register&quot; &quot;bespeaks old money, Ivy League, trust funds, privileges of birth, fox hunting, debutante balls, yachting, polo, distinguished forebears, family compounds in the Adirondacks, and a pedigree studded with 19th-century robber barons&quot;.

However, while inclusion in the &quot;Social Register&quot; was once so important for members of Society that, according to Brooke Astor, &quot;if someone wasn&#x27;t listed, you just didn&#x27;t know them&quot;, by the late 1990s its influence had seriously waned. In 2002, journalist Tom Wolfe said that he no longer heard regular reference to the &quot;Social Register&quot; and opined that the &quot;world of social luster has been so overshadowed by celebrities that it doesn’t have any kick anymore&quot;.

==Format==

Printed editions of &quot;The Social Register&quot; have long been bound in black with pumpkin-colored lettering. 

A person&#x27;s listing in the &quot;Register&quot; generally includes contact information, schools attended, and the social and country clubs to which he or she belongs. Many institutions and organizations are cited repeatedly using an extensive system of abbreviations (&quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;P&quot; for Princeton University, &quot;BtP&quot; for the Bath and Tennis Club of Palm Beach, Florida).

=== Cities with Social Register editions ===
As of 1917:
* New York City 
* Washington, D.C.
* Philadelphia (inc. Wilmington)

==Inclusion and exclusion==

=== Inclusion ===
Traditionally, wealth or fame have been insufficient for inclusion in the &quot;Social Register&quot;. Kim Kardashian and Gloria Vanderbilt were never listed and Donald Trump, prior to his election as President of the United States, was not included. A 1985 article reported that &quot;enrollees need plenty of green (money), blue (blood), and lily white (reputation)&quot;. 

Listing in the &quot;Social Register&quot; has typically been through birth: Children born to a person listed in the &quot;Social Register&quot; are added. Persons are permitted to apply for inclusion in the &quot;Social Register&quot;. Such applications require letters of sponsorship from five persons already listed, followed by vetting from the advisory committee. In 1997, a spokesman for the &quot;Social Register&quot;″s then 25-member advisory committee described the criteria by which a person might be added to the directory. The committee, he said, asked themselves, &quot;Would one want to have dinner with this person on a regular basis&quot;?

The President of the United States and Vice President of the United States are, by custom, always added.

===Exclusion===
Reasons for removal from the &quot;Social Register&quot; have traditionally been opaque. In the early 20th century, historian Dixon Wecter observed that those excluded tended to be persons unfavorably reported upon in the press and that, as long as one&#x27;s private life &quot;keeps out of the [newspaper&#x27;s] columns&quot; the risk of exclusion was low. 

A &quot;Social Register&quot; spokesman reported, in 1985, that elderly persons who failed to remit the questionnaire sent to listed persons by the register for eleven consecutive years were removed. In addition, someone who married a person who was not, themselves, listed in the &quot;Social Register&quot; might have been dropped. On the other hand, a 2018 article indicated that marriage to a listed person would &quot;automatically [bestow] membership on the lesser-pedigreed spouse&quot;.

As of 1988, about 35,000 individuals were included in the &quot;Social Register&quot;. By 2014, this number was reported to be approximately 25,000.

<text>Colin Michael Foale (; born 6 January 1957) is a British-American astrophysicist and a former NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of six space missions, and is the only NASA astronaut to have flown extended missions aboard both Mir and the International Space Station. He was the second Briton in space and the first to perform a space walk. Until 17 April 2008, he held the record for most time spent in space by a US citizen: 374 days, 11 hours, 19 minutes, and he held the cumulative-time-in-space record for a British citizen.

==Life and career==
Foale was born in Louth, Lincolnshire, to a British father, Colin, and an American mother, Mary. His father was an RAF officer who retired with the rank of Air Commodore. Foale was raised in Cambridge and educated at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. A member of the Air Training Corps, he studied at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge receiving a first-class honours BA degree in natural sciences in 1978 (later promoted to a Cambridge MA), and subsequenltly a PhD in laboratory astrophysics in 1982, where his supervisor was Alan Cook. When he left university, he &quot;owned two pairs of jeans, a donkey jacket, a bicycle and a pilot&#x27;s licence; which shows I had my priorities absolutely right&quot;.

While a postgraduate student at Cambridge University, Foale participated in the organisation and execution of scientific scuba diving projects. Pursuing a career in the US Space Program, Foale moved to Houston, Texas, to work on Space Shuttle navigation problems for McDonnell Douglas. In June 1983, Foale joined NASA Johnson Space Center in the payload operations area of the Mission Operations Directorate. In his capacity as payload officer in the Mission Control Center, he was responsible for payload operations on Space Shuttle missions STS-51G, 51-I, 61-B and 61-C.

Born in the United Kingdom, Foale applied and was turned down twice as an astronaut candidate. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in January 1986, Foale changed his application essay from writing about his dreams to focusing on the realities of leadership faced by NASA, and was selected in 1987.
He flew on Space Shuttle missions STS-45 (1992), STS-56 (1993) and STS-63 (1995). In the last mission, he undertook a four-hour EVA. He was then selected for an extended mission aboard the Russian Mir space station.

Launched by STS-84 and returned by STS-86, Foale spent four months on Mir in 1997 during the Mir 23 and Mir 24 missions. During Mir 23, the station&#x27;s Spektr module was struck by a Progress resupply vessel. Using knowledge from his physics degree Foale made calculations of how the stars were moving past his fixed-point thumb reference on a window, and was thus able to advise Russian ground control of how to stop the resulting roll. The two Russian cosmonauts of Mir 23, Vasily Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin were planned to conduct an intravehicular activity (IVA) to inspect the collision damage from the interior of the space station, but this IVA was actually carried out by Mir EO-24 crew. After the Mir EO-24 crew exchange, Soyuz TM-26 with all three crew aboard was undocked, repositioned and re-docked. Foale acted as photographer during the operation. Foale and Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev also conducted a six-hour EVA in Russian Orlan spacesuits to inspect exterior damage to the Spektr module. Station damage produced significant risk to EVA suit integrity. For his efforts, he was awarded the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. Subsequently, Mir&#x27;s primary and backup oxygen generation systems failed, but these were successfully repaired by the crew. The station also experienced computer failures and problems orientating the solar arrays at the correct angle to the Sun. All these difficulties combined to produce what, looking back 20 years later, was arguably, the most dangerous long-duration mission for a NASA astronaut. The problems encountered by Foale and his predecessor aboard Mir, Jerry Linenger, resulted in intense political pressure on NASA. The final decision between the termination of NASA crewing of Mir with Foale&#x27;s departure, or his scheduled replacement by David Wolf was only made by NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin the night before the launch of STS-86.

In 1999, Foale was a member of Space Shuttle mission STS-103, during which he conducted an eight-hour spacewalk to replace components of the Hubble Space Telescope. In 2003, Foale was named commander of International Space Station Expedition 8 with cosmonaut Aleksandr Kaleri. During their six-month tour of duty on the station, Foale and Kaleri carried out a 4-hour Russian EVA in Orlan-M space suits to install experiments outside the Service Module. The EVA was cut short when significant amounts of water in Kaleri&#x27;s helmet prevented further work. Expedition 8 ended on 29 April 2004. For about a year, Foale was Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Operations at NASA HQ, Washington D.C. He then supported Soyuz and ISS operations and spacesuit development for NASA in Houston.

In August 2013, it was announced that Foale was leaving the agency after a 26-year career to work on developing an electric aircraft to advance green aviation technology. Since leaving NASA, Foale has become actively involved in the running of the International Space Schools Education Trust, especially their Mission Discovery and trips to Star City, Russia, giving unique experiences to students around the world. Mission Discovery is held each year at the Guy&#x27;s Campus at King&#x27;s College London.

==Honours==
Foale was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in July 2000 and an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Kent in September 2000. He was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the diplomatic list of the New Year Honours in December 2004.

It is possible he has been patron to a pastoral house at the Folkestone Academy in Kent, which is also named after him. A street in Foale&#x27;s birth town was named Michael Foale Lane.

Foale and Ellen Ochoa were announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Married with two children, Foale and his family live in Seabrook, Texas. He is fluent in Russian. Foale is qualified to fly fixed-wing aeroplanes, gliders, as well as helicopters. He has never owned a brand-new car, though he has always wanted one, and his hobbies include windsurfing, gliding, and cross-country skiing.

Foale was the driver of a car in 1980 in Yugoslavia, when a truck accidentally veered across the road and smashed into his car, killing his girlfriend and his brother.
His father, Colin Foale, wrote a book in 1999 titled &quot;Waystation to the Stars&quot; about the astronaut&#x27;s experiences on Mir.

In his spare time, he has also worked with the International Space School Educational Trust (ISSET). This involvement is through him taking up the role of the resident astronaut during many of the Mission Discovery programmes operated by ISSET, when Foale shares his experiences of being in space with teenagers, while at the same time helping them to learn new skills. He does this throughout the period of the time the programme runs.

<text>Twycross is a small village and civil parish in the Hinckley and Bosworth district, in Leicestershire, England, on the A444 road. Situated in the far west of the county and close to the North Warwickshire border, the population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 850. The civil parish includes the villages of Norton Juxta Twycross and Orton on the Hill and the hamlets of Little Orton and Little Twycross, as well as Twycross Zoo, and the selective, private Twycross House School.

The Twycross Cricket Club is a village club with a 1st and 2nd XI who play in the Leicestershire Senior League. It also has a Sunday XI which plays many friendly games throughout the season.

The 1st team XI play regularly in the Premier division, whilst the 2nd team XI play in division 3, which hosts a 1st team and 2nd teams while also holding a Sunday friendly team. It has a youth set-up with under-15, under-13, and under-11 teams.

The church of St. James contains the oldest stained glass in England, originally from Sainte-Chapelle, Saint-Denis, and Le Mans Cathedral. The earliest glass is from Saint-Denis, the panels having been presented to William IV who gave them to Earl Howe, who got the glazier Thomas Willement to arrange and install them in the church during its restoration in the 1840s.

Twycross is the home of Rare, a video game developer owned by Xbox Game Studios.

== History ==
It is named &#x27;Twycross&#x27; because its centre lies at the intersection of three roads. The A444 connects it to Burton-on-Trent and Coventry and the B4116/B4114 to Birmingham.

On 1 April 1935 the parishes of Gopsall, Norton juxta Twycross and Orton on the Hill were merged with Twycross.

<text>Aleksandr &quot;Sasha&quot; Yuriyevich Kaleri (; born in Jūrmala, Latvia on 13 May 1956) is a former Russian cosmonaut and veteran of extended stays on the Mir Space Station and the International Space Station (ISS). Kaleri has most recently been in space in 2010 and 2011 aboard the ISS serving as a flight engineer for the long duration Expedition 25/26 missions. He has spent the fifth-longest time in space of any person, and the longest time in space of any person not born in what is now Russia.

== Personal ==
Kaleri is married to Svetlana L. Nosova. They have a son, Oleg Aleksandrovich Kaleri, born in 1996. Kaleri&#x27;s mother, Antonina Petrovna Kaleri, resides in Sevastopol, Crimea, and his father, Yuri Borisovich Kaleri, is deceased. Kaleri enjoys running, reading and gardening.

== Education ==
In 1979, Kaleri graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Moscow region, as a specialist in Aircraft Flight Dynamics and Control. In 1983, he completed post-graduate studies at the same institute as a specialist in the field of Mechanics of Fluids and Plasma.

== Experience ==
In 1979, he was hired by the Energia Corporation and worked on the Mir space station. He participated in development of design and engineering documentation, full-scale tests of the Mir. Kaleri is a skilled programmer.

== Cosmonaut career ==
Kaleri was selected as the Energia RSC cosmonaut candidate in April 1984. Between 1985 and 1986, he completed basic training and evaluation at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. In 1987 he was qualified for flight assignment as a test cosmonaut.

Kaleri took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir orbital station as a backup crew flight engineer of the Mir-3 mission from 1 April to 9 December 1987. He took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir as a backup crew flight engineer of the Mir-9 mission from January to April 1991. From 8 October 1991 to 25 February 1992, Kaleri was training as a primary crew flight engineer for the Mir-11 mission.

Kaleri has participated in three extended missions aboard the Mir Space Station. In 1992, he participated in a 145-day flight aboard the Soyuz-TM-14 spacecraft and the Mir. Between 17 August 1996 to 2 March 1997, Kaleri spent 197-days in space aboard the Soyuz-TM-24 spacecraft and the Mir as the Mir-22 mission flight engineer. In 2000, Kaleri performed his third spaceflight aboard the Soyuz-TM-30 spacecraft and the Mir as the Mir-28 mission flight engineer.

===Expedition 8===
In 2003, he first flew to the International Space Station (ISS) with NASA astronaut Michael Foale on his fourth spaceflight. Kaleri served as a Flight Engineer on Expedition 8 and spent 194 days in space from 18 October 2003 to 30 April 2004. The Soyuz TMA-3 spacecraft carrying Kaleri, Foale and ESA astronaut André Kuipers successfully landed in Kazakhstan at 00:11 GMT on 30 April 2004. The landing site was located some 60 kilometers northeast of the town of Arkalyk.

===Expedition 25/26===
Kaleri was a member (Flight Engineer) of the ISS Expedition 25/26, that was launched on 7 October 2010 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, aboard Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft, together with cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. He served as the Soyuz commander. The mission marked Kaleri&#x27;s fifth flight into space. He arrived at the ISS after the Soyuz spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 UTC on 10 October 2010. He remained in the ISS till March 2011. During their mission, Kaleri and the rest of the Expedition 25/26 crew participated in a wide array of research, including fundamental physics, biometric experiments and investigations of crystal growth in space, as well as education outreach.

=== Spacewalks ===

Kaleri has participated in five spacewalks and has accumulated 23 EVA hours.

On 8 July 1992, at 12:38 UTC Kaleri started his first career spacewalk. During the spacewalk, he and cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko inspected some of Mir&#x27;s gyrodynes. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes.

On 2 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk. The main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the Mir station. The spacewalk was Kaleri&#x27;s second career spacewalk.

On 9 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk. The spacewalk began at 13:50 UTC and ended at 20:28 UTC. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new Kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide Progress vehicles docking with Mir. They also repaired the transceiver system that the Mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the world.

On 12 May 2000, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of Mir. The two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to seal tiny cracks, and applied the new airtight sealant to a special panel imitating a damaged section in Mir&#x27;s skin. The two cosmonauts also examined the exterior of the Progress M1-2 cargo spacecraft.

On 26 February 2004, Kaleri and NASA astronaut Michael Foale floated outside the ISS from the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment airlock. The spacewalk began at 4:17 EST, and Foale and Kaleri were able to complete all but two of their planned tasks, swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the station&#x27;s hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts. Although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes, it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in Kaleri&#x27;s spacesuit. Kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit&#x27;s visor. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes. The excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for Kaleri.

<doc id="466160" wikidata="Q424388" url="?curid=466160" title="Akwa Ibom State">
<text>Akwa Ibom is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It borders Cross River State to the east, Rivers State and Abia State to the west and north-west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. The state takes its name from the Qua Iboe River which bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. Akwa Ibom was split from Cross River State in 1987. The state has 31 local government areas, and its capital is Uyo.

Of the 36 states, Akwa Ibom is the 30th largest in area and fifteenth most populous, with an estimated population of nearly 5.5 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is divided between the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and the Cross–Niger transition forests in the rest of the state. Other important geographical features are the Imo and Cross rivers which flow along Akwa Ibom&#x27;s eastern and western borders respectively while the Kwa Ibo River bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. In the southeast corner of the state is the &quot;Stubb Creek Forest Reserve&quot;, a heavily threatened wildlife reserve that contains declining crocodile, putty-nosed monkey, red-capped mangabey, and Sclater&#x27;s guenon populations along with potentially extirpated populations of African leopard and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are large fish populations alongside various cetacean species, including bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, humpback whales, and killer whales.

Modern-day Akwa Ibom State has been inhabited by various ethnic groups for hundreds of years, primarily the closely related Ibibio, Annang, and Oron peoples in the North-East, North-West, and Southern zones of the state, respectively.

Economically, Akwa Ibom State is based around the production of crude oil and natural gas as highest oil-producing state in the country. Key minor industries involve agriculture as the state has substantial cocoyam, yam, and plantain crops along with fishing and heliciculture. Despite its vast oil revenues, Akwa Ibom has the seventeenth highest Human Development Index in the country in large part due to years of systemic corruption.

==Economy==
Akwa Ibom State&#x27;s economy is based on the production of crude oil and natural gas. It produces the most oil of any state in the country. It includes the following oil- producing Local Government Areas: Ibeno, Mbo, and Eastern Obolo.

Key minor industries are based on agriculture; the state has substantial cocoyam, yam, and plantain crops, along with fishing and heliciculture. 

Despite its vast oil revenues, Akwa Ibom ranks as seventeenth among the states List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019 in the Human Development Index. Years of systemic corruption have resulted in such revenues being diverted from improving infrastructure, education and welfare of the people.

== Languages ==
&quot;There are 20 languages spoken as first languages in Akwa Ibom State.&quot; However, comparing different sources show there are slightly over 20 languages. They are as follows (in alphabetical order) with the LGAs in which they are spoken:

* Anaang - Abak, Essien Udim, Ikot Ekpene, Oruk-Anam, and Ukanafun LGAs
* Ebughu - Mbo and Oron LGAs
* Efai - Mbo LGA
* Efik - Itu, Oron, Uruan LGAs
* Ekit- Eket and Esit Eket LGAs
* Enwang - Mbo LGA
* Etebi - Esit Eket LGA
* Ibibio - Etinan, Ikono, Ikot Abasi, Itu, Mkpat Enin, Nsit Atai, Nsit-Ubium, Onna, Uruan and Uyo LGAs.
* Ibino (Ibọnọ) - Ibeno LGA
* Ibuoro - Ikono and Itu LGAs
* Idere - Itu LGA
* Igbo - Ika LGA
* Ika - Ika LGA
* Iko - Eastern Obolo LGA
* Ilue - Oron LGA
* Itu Mbon Uso - Ikono and Itu LGAs
* Iwerre - Ini LGA
* Nkari - Ini and Ikono LGA
* Obolo (Andoni) - Eastern Obolo and Ibeno LGAs
* Okobo - Okobo LGA
* Oro - Oron LGA
* Uda - Mbo LGA

One research however claims to &quot;have identified just about 10 languages&quot;, claiming that some languages are dialects of others, though the criteria for classification as dialects is not clearly stated.

== History ==
In the pre-colonial period, what is now Akwa Ibom State was divided into various city-states like the Ibom Kingdom and Akwa Akpa before they later became a British protectorate in 1884 as a part of the Oil Rivers Protectorate. Prior to the British colonization, no central government had existed among the people of what is now Akwa Ibom State. The various ethnic peoples were largely organized into clan communities, based on kinship and relations.

Several Scottish missionaries went to Calabar in 1848, and Ibono in 1887. The British government did not attempt to establish more control over the area until 1904. In that year, they organized the Enyong Division, encompassing the area of the current state of Akwa Ibom, with headquarters at Ikot Ekpene, a predominately Annang city. Noted Africanist Kaanan Nair, noted this city as the cultural and political capital of the Annang and Ibibio peoples. The greater Southeast was largely dominated by the majority Igbo people. The creation of Enyong Division encouraged collaboration among the numerous minority ethnic groups in the area. They created the Ibibio Welfare Union, later renamed Ibibio State Union. This social organization was first established as a local development and improvement forum for educated African persons and groups who in 1929 were still excluded from the colonial administration. It was dominated by British colonists and their appointees.

In the early 1900s, the British actually gained formal control of the area before incorporating the protectorate (now renamed the Niger Coast Protectorate) into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria; after the merger, much of modern-day Akwa Ibom became a centre of anti-colonial resistance during the Women&#x27;s War and political activism through the Ibibio State Union.

After independence in 1960, the area of now-Akwa Ibom was a part of the post-independence Eastern Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the South-Eastern State. Less than two months afterwards, the Igbo-majority former Eastern Region attempted to secede as the state of Biafra; in the three-year long Nigerian Civil War, now-Akwa Ibom was hard-fought over in the prelude to the Invasion of Port Harcourt while people from Akwa Ibom were persecuted by the Biafran forces as they were mainly non-Igbos. At the war&#x27;s end and the reunification of Nigeria, the South-Eastern State was reformed until 1976 when it was renamed Cross River State.

Eleven years later, Cross River State was divided on 23 September 1987, by the Military Administration of General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida. 

This division resulted in the creation of the state of Akwa Ibom, Uyo was chosen as the state capital in order to encourage development in all regions of the state.

<text>Joey DeMaio (born March 6, 1954) is an American musician who is the bass player and main songwriter for the heavy metal band Manowar which he founded in 1980. He is also the founder and CEO of Magic Circle Music.

== Biography ==
He is a childhood friend of Manowar singer Eric Adams. DeMaio played bass in several school bands. In the 1970s, he toured with the musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (premiere in 1971 in New York City), taking musical lessons with the conductor.
He worked as a pyro-tech for Black Sabbath during their &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; tour.

In 2006, shortly after creating the record label Magic Circle Music, DeMaio became a manager of the Italian metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He is also a producer for the band HolyHell.

<text>In thermodynamics, the Onsager reciprocal relations express the equality of certain ratios between flows and forces in thermodynamic systems out of equilibrium, but where a notion of local equilibrium exists.

&quot;Reciprocal relations&quot; occur between different pairs of forces and flows in a variety of physical systems. For example, consider fluid systems described in terms of temperature, matter density, and pressure. In this class of systems, it is known that temperature differences lead to heat flows from the warmer to the colder parts of the system; similarly, pressure differences will lead to matter flow from high-pressure to low-pressure regions. What is remarkable is the observation that, when both pressure and temperature vary, temperature differences at constant pressure can cause matter flow (as in convection) and pressure differences at constant temperature can cause heat flow. Perhaps surprisingly, the heat flow per unit of pressure difference and the density (matter) flow per unit of temperature difference are equal. This equality was shown to be necessary by Lars Onsager using statistical mechanics as a consequence of the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility). The theory developed by Onsager is much more general than this example and capable of treating more than two thermodynamic forces at once, with the limitation that &quot;the principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present&quot;, in which case &quot;the reciprocal relations break down&quot;.

Though the fluid system is perhaps described most intuitively, the high precision of electrical measurements makes experimental realisations of Onsager&#x27;s reciprocity easier in systems involving electrical phenomena. In fact, Onsager&#x27;s 1931 paper refers to thermoelectricity and transport phenomena in electrolytes as well known from the 19th century, including &quot;quasi-thermodynamic&quot; theories by Thomson and Helmholtz respectively. Onsager&#x27;s reciprocity in the thermoelectric effect manifests itself in the equality of the Peltier (heat flow caused by a voltage difference) and Seebeck (electric current caused by a temperature difference) coefficients of a thermoelectric material. Similarly, the so-called &quot;direct piezoelectric&quot; (electric current produced by mechanical stress) and &quot;reverse piezoelectric&quot; (deformation produced by a voltage difference) coefficients are equal. For many kinetic systems, like the Boltzmann equation or chemical kinetics, the Onsager relations are closely connected to the principle of detailed balance and follow from them in the linear approximation near equilibrium.

Experimental verifications of the Onsager reciprocal relations were collected and analyzed by D. G. Miller for many classes of irreversible processes, namely for thermoelectricity, electrokinetics, transference in electrolytic solutions, diffusion, conduction of heat and electricity in anisotropic solids, thermomagnetism and galvanomagnetism. In this classical review, chemical reactions are considered as &quot;cases with meager&quot; and inconclusive evidence. Further theoretical analysis and experiments support the reciprocal relations for chemical kinetics with transport. Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation is another special case of the Onsager reciprocal relations applied to the wavelength-specific radiative emission and absorption by a material body in thermodynamic equilibrium.

For his discovery of these reciprocal relations, Lars Onsager was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The presentation speech referred to the three laws of thermodynamics and then added &quot;It can be said that Onsager&#x27;s reciprocal relations represent a further law making a thermodynamic study of irreversible processes possible.&quot; Some authors have even described Onsager&#x27;s relations as the &quot;Fourth law of thermodynamics&quot;.

== Example: Fluid system ==

=== The fundamental equation ===
The basic thermodynamic potential is internal energy. In a simple fluid system, neglecting the effects of viscosity, the fundamental thermodynamic equation is written:
formula_1
where &quot;U&quot; is the internal energy, &quot;T&quot; is temperature, &quot;S&quot; is entropy, &quot;P&quot; is the hydrostatic pressure, &quot;V&quot; is the volume, formula_2 is the chemical potential, and &quot;M&quot; mass. In terms of the internal energy density, &quot;u&quot;, entropy density &quot;s&quot;, and mass density formula_3, the fundamental equation at fixed volume is written:
formula_4

For non-fluid or more complex systems there will be a different collection of variables describing the work term, but the principle is the same. The above equation may be solved for the entropy density:
formula_5

The above expression of the first law in terms of entropy change defines the entropic conjugate variables of formula_6 and formula_3, which are formula_8 and formula_9 and are intensive quantities analogous to potential energies; their gradients are called thermodynamic forces as they cause flows of the corresponding extensive variables as expressed in the following equations.

=== The continuity equations ===

The conservation of mass is expressed locally by the fact that the flow of mass density formula_3 satisfies the continuity equation:
formula_11
where formula_12 is the mass flux vector. The formulation of energy conservation is generally not in the form of a continuity equation because it includes contributions both from the macroscopic mechanical energy of the fluid flow and of the microscopic internal energy. However, if we assume that the macroscopic velocity of the fluid is negligible, we obtain energy conservation in the following form:
formula_13
where formula_6 is the internal energy density and formula_15 is the internal energy flux.

Since we are interested in a general imperfect fluid, entropy is locally not conserved and its local evolution can be given in the form of entropy density formula_16 as
formula_17
where formula_18 is the rate of increase in entropy density due to the irreversible processes of equilibration occurring in the fluid and formula_19 is the entropy flux.

=== The phenomenological equations ===

In the absence of matter flows, Fourier&#x27;s law is usually written:
formula_20
where formula_21 is the thermal conductivity. However, this law is just a linear approximation, and holds only for the case where formula_22, with the thermal conductivity possibly being a function of the thermodynamic state variables, but not their gradients or time rate of change. Assuming that this is the case, Fourier&#x27;s law may just as well be written:
formula_23

In the absence of heat flows, Fick&#x27;s law of diffusion is usually written:
formula_24
where &quot;D&quot; is the coefficient of diffusion. Since this is also a linear approximation and since the chemical potential is monotonically increasing with density at a fixed temperature, Fick&#x27;s law may just as well be written:
formula_25
where, again, formula_26 is a function of thermodynamic state parameters, but not their gradients or time rate of change. For the general case in which there are both mass and energy fluxes, the phenomenological equations may be written as:
formula_27
formula_28
or, more concisely,
formula_29

where the entropic &quot;thermodynamic forces&quot; conjugate to the &quot;displacements&quot; formula_6 and formula_3 are formula_32 and formula_33 and formula_34 is the Onsager matrix of transport coefficients.

=== The rate of entropy production ===

From the fundamental equation, it follows that:
formula_35
and
formula_36

Using the continuity equations, the rate of entropy production may now be written:
formula_37
and, incorporating the phenomenological equations:
formula_38

It can be seen that, since the entropy production must be non-negative, the Onsager matrix of phenomenological coefficients formula_34 is a positive semi-definite matrix.

=== The Onsager reciprocal relations ===

Onsager&#x27;s contribution was to demonstrate that not only is formula_34 positive semi-definite, it is also symmetric, except in cases where time-reversal symmetry is broken. In other words, the cross-coefficients formula_41 and formula_42 are equal. The fact that they are at least proportional is suggested by simple dimensional analysis (i.e., both coefficients are measured in the same units of temperature times mass density). 

The rate of entropy production for the above simple example uses only two entropic forces, and a 2×2 Onsager phenomenological matrix. The expression for the linear approximation to the fluxes and the rate of entropy production can very often be expressed in an analogous way for many more general and complicated systems.

== Abstract formulation ==
Let formula_43 denote fluctuations from equilibrium values in several thermodynamic quantities, and let formula_44 be the entropy. Then, Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy formula gives for the probability distribution function formula_45, where &quot;A&quot; is a constant, since the probability of a given set of fluctuations formula_46 is proportional to the number of microstates with that fluctuation. Assuming the fluctuations are small, the probability distribution function can be expressed through the second differential of the entropy
formula_47
where we are using Einstein summation convention and formula_48 is a positive definite symmetric matrix.

Using the quasi-stationary equilibrium approximation, that is, assuming that the system is only slightly non-equilibrium, we have formula_49

Suppose we define &quot;thermodynamic conjugate&quot; quantities as formula_50, which can also be expressed as linear functions (for small fluctuations): formula_51

Thus, we can write formula_52 where formula_53 are called &quot;kinetic coefficients&quot;

The &quot;principle of symmetry of kinetic coefficients&quot; or the &quot;Onsager&#x27;s principle&quot; states that formula_54 is a symmetric matrix, that is formula_55

===Proof===

Define mean values formula_56 and formula_57 of fluctuating quantities formula_58 and formula_59 respectively such that they take given values formula_60 at formula_61. Note that formula_62

Symmetry of fluctuations under time reversal implies that formula_63

or, with formula_56, we have formula_65

Differentiating with respect to formula_66 and substituting, we get formula_67

Putting formula_68 in the above equation, formula_69

It can be easily shown from the definition that formula_70, and hence, we have the required result.

<text>The National Police Gazette, commonly referred to as simply the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;, is an American magazine founded in 1845. Under publisher Richard K. Fox, it became the forerunner of the men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine, the illustrated sports weekly, the girlie/pin-up magazine, the celebrity gossip column, Guinness World Records-style competitions, and modern tabloid/sensational journalism.

==Publication history==
The magazine was founded by two journalists, Enoch E. Camp, an attorney, and George Wilkes, a transcontinental railroad booster. It began as a chronicler of crime and criminals, intended for consumption by the general public. In 1866, Wilkes and Camp sold the &quot;Gazette&quot; to George W. Matsell. The editor and proprietor from 1877 until his death in 1922 was Richard Kyle Fox, an immigrant from Ireland.
Ostensibly devoted to matters of interest to the police, it was a tabloid-like publication, with lurid coverage of murders, Wild West outlaws, and sport. It was well known for its engravings and photographs of scantily clad strippers, burlesque dancers, and prostitutes, often skirting on the edge of what was legally considered obscenity. For decades it was a staple furnishing of barber shops, where men would peruse it awaiting their turn. The publication&#x27;s association with barber shops was noted in a Vaudeville routine in which the straight man asked &quot;Seen the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;?,&quot; and his partner replied &quot;No, I shave myself.&quot;

The &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; enjoyed considerable popularity in the late 19th century and early decades of the 20th century. Its popularity decreased during the Great Depression. In 1932 the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; ceased publication, and was sold at auction for a nominal sum. Publication was suspended from Feb. 11, 1932 until Sept. 5, 1933, when it was revived under the ownership of the Donenfelds, who placed it in the editorial hands of Mrs. Merle W. Hersey, the ex-wife of Harold Hersey. During this period the paper appeared twice a month and took on more of the flavor of a girlie magazine. The Donenfeld/Hersey regime did not last long. The magazine changed hands again within a year, coming into the possession of Harold H. Roswell and becoming a monthly publication in 1935. The &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; continued as a monthly publication in Roswell&#x27;s hands for many years. The Canadian newspaper publisher Joseph Azaria took it over in 1968, and it finally ceased print publication in 1977.

In September 1942, the United States Post Office barred delivery of the publication through the mail because of its &quot;obscene and lewd pictures.&quot;

In its heyday it was immensely influential. In the first part of the 20th century, the US became the center for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the &quot;world champions&quot; were those listed by the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;. Fox handed diamond-studded belts to champion prizefighters. After 1920, the National Boxing Association began to sanction &quot;title fights&quot;.

==Annual publication==

From 1896 to 1918, a Sporting Annual was published as a yearly summary of statistics in the sporting world. The guide touted themselves as &quot;Statistics and Best Performances in Pugilism, Athletics, Bicycling, Rowing, Baseball, Trotting, and Racing.&quot; The 200+ page publication was compiled by Sam C. Austin, editor of the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Although primarily focused on boxing, there are dozens of unique illustrations and summaries on other sports that are of particular interest to those studying the history of sports.

== Frank Samuelsen and George Harbo ==
In 1896, the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; allegedly offered a prize of $10,000 (about $300,000 in 2018 money) to the first to row across the Atlantic Ocean, though no contemporary source exists confirming a &quot;Police Gazette&quot; offer of any significant monetary prize. In the same year, George Harbo and Frank Samuelsen invested their savings in an 18-foot rowboat, which they named &#x27;Fox&#x27; after the editor of the &quot;Gazette&quot;, Richard K. Fox. Despite crossing the Atlantic in 55 days (a record not broken until 2010, albeit by a team of four rowers) the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; never paid the men the promised prize money, though no contemporary sources exist showing the money was ever offered by the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; or that the men were expecting a substantial sum from the &quot;Gazette&quot;. Numerous sources report the men were expecting either no money or only whatever money could be raised from exhibitions following successful completion of the voyage. Sources also show Richard K. Fox and the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; offered and provided towing of the &#x27;Fox&#x27; to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn—the last outside propulsion used by Harbo and Samuelsen until reaching Europe; payment of expenses incurred by the American consulate in Le Havre for their food, clothing, and temporary shelter upon reaching the continent; two gold medals commemorating the achievement; and publicity within the pages of the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was also the only newspaper willing to attach its name to the endeavor as others considered it too risky.

==Entertainment coverage of the vaudeville stage==
On July 27, 1901 appeared as one of &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; headlines for reviews of popular entertainers, &quot;Paragraphs of Interest Concerning the Stage Lives and Doings of Vaudeville People, Here can be Found Many Items Which Will Interest Performers as Well as Theater Goers, Professionals Requested to Send in Photos.&quot; On the list of favorably reviewed entertainers that included ventriloquists, minstrels, songsters, aerialists, and comedians was listed Pat H. Chappelle and his The Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Company among other vaudeville shows.

==Hitler conspiracy theories==
The &quot;Gazette&quot; claimed in 1939 that Adolf Hitler was homosexual and questioned in 1946 and 1947 whether he had really died in his Berlin bunker in 1945. Between 1951 and 1972, the &quot;Gazette&quot; published scores of stories asserting that Hitler could have somehow survived (often featuring him on the cover), contradicting the widely accepted account of his death. Writing for the &quot;Gazette&quot;, US intelligence officer William F. Heimlich asserted that Hitler&#x27;s body would not have burned to ashes in the open air of the Reich Chancellery garden and that according to US tests the blood found on Hitler&#x27;s sofa did not match his blood type. Other narratives range from the details of Hitler&#x27;s alleged escape (with destinations including Antarctica and South America) to his supposed prime physical health and conceiving two children with Eva Braun around the late 1930s. In 2017, the &quot;Gazette&quot; published a new article reviving the narrative and calling on the Russian government to allow Hitler&#x27;s dental remains to be DNA-tested to settle the matter.

==Current incarnation==
Since 2007, the &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; has been managed by National Police Gazette Enterprises, LLC, which houses the official &quot;Police Gazette&quot; magazine archive, publishes new content online, puts out compilations of classic content from the past, provides a research service, and manages &quot;Police Gazette&quot; trademarks and copyrights.

===Bare Knuckle Boxing===
The &quot;Police Gazette&quot; was the first organized boxing sanctioning body in the US, declaring its intention in 1881 and issuing championships beginning in 1882. Integral to the Police Gazette Rules was the requirement that championships be contested bare knuckle. Though all professional championship boxing was technically illegal, the &quot;Gazette&quot; continued as the bare-knuckle sanctioning organization until 1894 when it was clear gloved boxing would be the only acceptable mainstream version of the sport.

In March 2018, Wyoming became the first jurisdiction to legalize bare-knuckle fighting at the state level, and formal bare knuckle events have been happening since June 2018. In response, National Police Gazette Enterprises, LLC, in partnership with the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame of Belfast, NY, created the Police Gazette Boxing Corporation as the successor to the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;&#x27;s original bare knuckle boxing sanctioning activities. Current &quot;Police Gazette&quot; Champions are the lineal bare knuckle champions going back to those in the 19th century, such as John L. Sullivan.

Tippmann Industrial Products, a related company manufactures manual and pneumatic heavy-duty sewing machines primarily used for leather, other leather-related equipment, and some industrial products. Originally a family-owned business run from Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2004 Dennis Tippmann Sr. sold a majority ownership stake to Summit Partners, a private equity firm. Tippmann designed one of the first automatic markers, the use of refillable air systems in place of 12 gram cartridges, the &quot;Cyclone Feed&quot; system, the &quot;Flatline&quot; barrel, and the Tippmann C-3, the first propane-powered marker.

== History ==
The Tippmann family, headed by Dennis Tippmann Senior, originally manufactured collectible, half-scale replica machine guns. However, a change in gun laws led to entry into the paintball market in 1986; forming the Tippmann Pneumatics Incorporated company. The company attempted to make high-performance, durable and affordable products - with the company claiming to have built the first semi-automatic and full-automatic paintball markers in the world.

In June 2004, Tippmann announced that the company had completed a financial recapitalization with private equity and venture capital firm Summit Partners. Howard Kosick joined Tippmann as its president and CEO, with both Dennis Tippman Senior and Dennis Tippmann Junior remaining on the company’s Board of directors as consultants; the latter continuing with the management team in product development. Shortly afterward in 2005, the company announced a record year for increased sales of paint marker units.

The company has been credited with the development of several technologies, including the introduction of &quot;C3 with PEP Technology&quot; propane markers in 2005, and improved &quot;Anti-Chop&quot; technology in 2006 to combat paintball breakages inside the marker.

In 2010, Tippmann Sports acquired NXe, a manufacturer of soft goods for the paintball industry. The acquisition combined the industry’s leading paintball marker brand with the leading soft goods brand. A full line of paintball harnesses, protective gear, tank covers, apparel, bags, pods and other miscellaneous accessories were immediately integrated into Tippmann’s existing product offering.

On December 20, 2013, the acquisition of Tippmann was announced by G.I. Sportz Chairman and CEO Richmond Italia.

== Current paintball markers ==
=== Tippmann M4 Carbine (TMC) ===

The &quot;TMC&quot; is Tippmann&#x27;s &quot;MagFed&quot; Paintball Marker. It was first sold to the public in 2016 it can be magazine or hopper fed. It comes in an all black or a black and tan finish. The TMC is approximately in weight.

=== Tippmann Tactical Compact Rifle (TCR) ===
The &quot;TCR&quot; is Tippmann&#x27;s &quot;MagFed&quot; only close-quarters battle military simulation magazine fed paintball marker. The manual was published in February 2015. The TCR is first strike round ready out of the box. It can be powered by 12 gram cartridges or by using a remote line to a larger tank. This paintball marker cannot use a hopper without being disassembled to install an adapter and must be reloaded via magazine. The TCR is about in weight.

=== Cronus ===
The &quot;Cronus&quot; was released by Tippmann in December 2013. It comes in a &quot;Basic&quot; version, which includes just the marker and simple barrel. It also comes in a &quot;Tactical&quot; version, with a more M16-like appearance. The Tactical version features a 6-position adjustable stock, barrel shroud, forward grip, and a removable carry handle, similar to that seen on the Alpha Black Elite. It comes in a desert tan or olive green finish.

=== Crossover ===
Debuting in 2012, the Crossover is aimed at both Speedball and Recreational play. The Crossover utilizes the latest version of the FlexValve, allowing it to fire in both Electronic and Mechanical modes. Other advancements and features include integrated break beam anti-chop eyes, low pressure operation under 300 PSI allowing users to use LPA tanks and a magnetic hall effect trigger. The upper body is a solid-machined piece of aluminum and has a centered adjusting feedback to allow the use of any hopper.

Being a &quot;hybrid&quot; marker, the Crossover board comes with pre-installed tournament modes for semi-pro and professional speedball play. The board features multiple adjustable firing modes, including standard semi-auto, auto-response, 3-shot burst, PSP, NPPL and Millennium modes. It also has a bottom regulator with the ability to convert to a front regulator so players can easily run their own regulator. As an added bonus of having a bottom regulator, the Crossover has the ability to utilize an internal gas line to keep the marker cleaner looking on the outside.

=== FT-12 ===
The &quot;FT-12&quot; is one of Tippmann&#x27;s newest paintball markers. Debuting in 2012, the FT-12 is aimed at rental and beginner use. The FT-12 uses a new body design never seen before in a Tippmann, using die-cast receivers. Splitting along the sides to open at the top, the FT-12 gives users a top-down view of the internals. The new body design can allow field owners to easily and quickly maintain their markers, with a savings of 75% in work time. The entire marker can be disassembled and reassembled in seconds, with everything coming right out the top. The FT-12 also utilizes an internal gas line, which prevents damage and leaks. The FT-12 also uses an enclosed bolt, similar to the A5, keeping dirt and debris from entering the marker through the cocking arm opening.

The FT-12 comes stock with a vertical foregrip that can be removed. The Ft-12 shares a thread similar to the 98 Custom &quot;quick-thread&quot; design, allowing the use of 98 Custom barrels. No other upgrades are available or compatible.

The FT-12 comes in 2 versions, a bright yellow framed rental version with rental labels riveted to the sides, and a black public version. Both generally sell for the same amount.

=== 98 Custom Platinum ===
The Tippmann 98 Custom has undergone many body and internal changes, but has remained almost the same over the years since being released in 1998. Tippmann&#x27;s most recent 98 model, the &quot;98 Custom Platinum&quot;, has many of Tippmann&#x27;s most recent technology changes while keeping the 98 Custom a very reliable, basic and upgradeable marker. The 98 Custom utilizes the &quot;clamshell&quot; body design with a split receiver for even easier access to the internals. The powertube and valve were also redesigned with a self-sealing / locking gas line to allow easier removal. The marker is flat-topped, and unlike earlier 98 Customs, comes pre-grooved to allow the use of all picatinny accessories like sights, scopes and handles right out of the box. The marker features a new finish and a textured vertical foregrip with internal locking pins to provide extra stability. Other advancements include an integrated front sight spring and a solid rear sight, to make service easier. They also started making the stock endcap with a sling mount.

ACT (Anti-Chop Technology) is featured in current versions of the 98 Custom.

Tippmann also produces upgrades for the 98 Custom including the Response Trigger, eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The 98 Custom utilizes a &quot;quick-thread&quot; design that allows for quick and painless installation/ removal, and can take all 98 Custom threaded barrels and Flatline systems.

=== Gryphon ===
The &quot;Gryphon&quot; is essentially the same in-line blowback internals as the 98 custom, in a low cost speedball-esque style body. It has an internal gas line, fixed center-feed neck, a top cocking knob, and a 2 finger blade trigger. Sharing the same threads as the A5 and X7 Phenom, any A5/X7 barrel can be used. It was designed to give entry-level players on a budget an easy to maintain, effective and reliable marker for the lowest price possible. Its price is comparable to many of the &quot;no-name&quot; guns found in department stores, however the common parts and proven design make it far more reliable and repairable, allowing for years of use. The primary drawback of the marker is its limited upgrade options, although some internal upgrades MAY be interchangeable with the 98 Custom &amp; US Army lineups.

=== A-5 ===
In appearance, the &quot;A-5&quot; was modeled after the H&amp;K MP5K but can be modified to look like a number of different real-world firearms. It is one of the most customizable markers on the market, with many different cosmetic and performance parts. The Tippmann A5 could easily accept standard ASA expansion chambers and regulators allowing easier performance upgrades, unlike the later X-7. Departing from previous Tippmann bodies, the A-5s hammer is completely enclosed within the clam-shell, using a separate overhead cocking mechanism. The body also incorporates a removable barrel thread adapter, allowing the marker to change its barrel threads to any major type (Spyder and Autococker being the most common).

The A-5 is a semi-automatic paintball marker. It utilizes an atypical pneumatic loader called the &quot;Cyclone Feed&quot; similar to the Tippmann F/As force feed. This enables the marker to have a higher rate of fire than a gravity feed without the addition of a battery-operated loader (at the cost of air efficiency). It uses a larger surface area and a series of rotating arms in a star-shaped pattern. Five balls are held between the paddles as they rotate paintballs into the firing chamber (moving 1/5 of a revolution per trigger pull). Theoretically, this system eliminates chops by positively feeding a paintball into the chamber before each shot.

The stock Cyclone is rated for a maximum of 15 balls per second. While higher rates of fire are possible, the stock mechanics are not designed to deal with the stresses this will place on them. This limitation was addressed during the creation of the X-7.

In addition to the stock semi-automatic function, the A-5 can be easily upgraded with either the Response Trigger or an Electronic Trigger by swapping out the lower grip frame, a feature introduced on the A-5.

=== X7 Phenom ===
The X7 Phenom is almost identical to the X7, with a few superficial differences, and an important internal difference. The X7 Phenom is 3 inches shorter than its X7 counterpart but still utilizes the same &quot;clamshell&quot; design. It also comes stock with a top Picatinny rail allowing the use of sights, scopes, and handles, and a hand-guard with top and bottom Picatinny rails. The X7 Phenom can use almost all X7 accessories and still uses the Cyclone feed system. X7 grips, however, cannot work on the X7 Phenom. The X7 supports full-auto firing with compatible E-grips.

Internally, the X7 Phenom is pioneered with Tippmann&#x27;s new &quot;Flex Valve&quot; technology, allowing the marker to fire with under 300 PSI, making it more air/ efficient. It also allows electro versions of the X7 Phenom to fire in mechanical semi-automatic mode when the battery for the electro-pneumatic operation has been depleted. The X7 Phenom also fires noticeably quieter and with less recoil than the X7.
=== TPX / TiPX ===
The &quot;Tippmann TPX&quot; is a low-cost, high-performance paintball pistol. Eight- or seven-round magazines are inserted into the bottom of the grip like a normal pistol. The pistol features an A5/X7 threaded barrel, making it compatible with all A5/X7 barrels that are 7/8 inch in outer diameter. The TPX can also be powered on both HPA or by an external source using an adapter or can utilize a 12 gram cartridge that is inserted into a chamber under the barrel. Similar to Tippman&#x27;s other markers, the TPX utilizes the &quot;clamshell&quot; design and in place of metal uses a high-impact polymer to help keep down the weight.

The &quot;Tippmann TiPX&quot; is the second generation of the pistol. The second generation mostly included fixes to the valve and regulator, and also combined them both into one solid piece. The &quot;Tru-Feed&quot; magazine was also introduced to correct misfeeding that the 8-round magazines would occasionally have. Tippmann has been known to send owners of the TPX new TiPX internals in trade for the old ones, and also trade in the old 8-round magazines for the 7-round Tru-Feed magazines.

Accessories for the pistol include the Remote Line Adapter kit, which allows users to use an external continuous air source like HPA or . Tippmann&#x27;s &quot;Hammerhead&quot; barrels will also fit, and they sell leg holsters and spare magazines compatible with the pistol.

==== U.S. ARMY Line ====
The U.S. ARMY line of paintball markers is produced by Tippmann in partnership and licensed under the U.S. ARMY name.

=== Alpha Black Elite ===
The &quot;Alpha Black Elite&quot; (Bravo One outside the US) is a blowback design modeled after the 98 Custom, using &quot;clamshell&quot; body halves. In 2013, the Alpha Black was re-designed to use body halves similar to that of the &quot;Project Salvo&quot;, but retaining its M16 look. With the redesign, Tippmann added on their removable M16 carry handle, and re-designed the handguard to feature a Picatinny rail to allow the use of foregrips.

The Alpha Black Elite still has 3 variants similar to that of the Alpha Black. The &quot;Alpha Black Elite&quot;, consisting of just the marker and its accessories. The &quot;Alpha Black Elite Powerpack&quot;, consisting of the marker, and a beginners kit made of a mask, tank and hopper. And the &quot;Alpha Black Elite with E-Grip&quot; which is the same as the &quot;Alpha Black Elite&quot; but with added E-Grip internals.

=== Project Salvo ===
The &quot;Project Salvo&quot; (Sierra One outside the US) is a blowback design similar to the 98 Custom using &quot;clamshell&quot; body halves molded to resemble the AR-15. To date, there is only 1 version of the Project Salvo being sold by Tippmann. The Project Salvo comes with an AR-15 styled handguard with 4 picatinny rails. It also comes with a 6-position collapsible stock that also folds to the right of the marker. The entire top of the marker is flat-topped and is also grooved to work as a picatinny rail, allowing the use of sights and scopes and also handles.

Tippmann also produces upgrades for the Project Salvo including the Response Trigger, eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The Project Salvo utilizes the same &quot;quick-thread&quot; design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom Flatline and barrel upgrades can be used.

=== Carver One ===
The &quot;Carver One&quot; (Tango One outside the US) is a blowback design similar to the 98 Custom using &quot;clamshell&quot; body halves molded to resemble the M4. It also has three small picatinny rails toward the front to allow the use of flashlights, foregrips and bipods, as well as a picatinny rail along the top to allow the use of sights, scopes and handles. To date, there are 3 versions of the Carver One being sold by Tippmann. The &quot;basic&quot; version comes with only the Carver One. The &quot;Carver One PowerPack&quot; version comes with the Carver One, and like the Alpha Black PowerPack, the Carver One also comes with a tank, a 200-round gravity hopper and the TP420 goggle system. The &quot;Carver One + eGrip&quot; version comes with the basic Carver One with the eGrip internals installed.

As of 2012, Tippmann has started including a vertical foregrip with the Carver One on all of its versions.

The Carver One utilizes the same &quot;quick-thread&quot; design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom barrel upgrades can be used. Because of the body design, the Cyclone feed system and Flatline systems cannot be used on the Carver One.

== Additional Equipment and Technologies ==
=== A.C.T. ===
Tippmann recently introduced a feature known as A.C.T. (Anti-Chop Technology), which is a mechanical system integrated into the bolt system to reduce the chance of jams due to misfed paintballs. In the 98 Custom and Custom Pro markers, the hammer has a deep groove that the linkage arm sits in, along with the ACT spring to keep it in position (there is also a small hole to insert the linkage arm into if the user chooses not to use the ACT function). If a paintball is incorrectly fed into the breech when the bolt is closing, the bolt stops on the paintball with little pressure from the ACT spring, while the hammer continues on its stroke unlinked to the bolt. It hits the valve and is blown back open, where it re-engages the linkage arm and retracts the bolt, letting the paintball fall into the breech correctly. The marker is now ready to fire again. The Tippmann A.C.T feature is very similar to Spyder&#x27;s ACS bolt.

=== Cyclone Feed System ===
Much like the Response Trigger System, the Cyclone Feed System uses the excess gas from firing the marker to cycle a feeding mechanism providing up to 15 balls per second. (Some have tested the unit at 20+ Balls Per Second with some commercially available modifications.) In comparison with conventional hoppers, the Cyclone has a much wider mouth, holding multiple paintballs in the feeding mechanism even without a hopper.

As a shot is fired, excess (normally waste) gas from the shot is scavenged through the side of the marker via a banjo fitting (a T-type fitting is required for use with the response trigger system). The gas is utilized to rotate the cyclone as the marker re-cocks, force-feeding a paintball into the chamber. The Cyclone Feed System comes standard on the Tippmann A-5 and an enhanced version comes on the X-7. Tippmann offers Cyclone upgrades for 98 Custom and Custom Pro users. The advent of the Cyclone Feed System marks the first widely used, non-electronic, agitated hopper. The lack of electronics means the user can expose the system to moisture (rain, snow, etc.) which would interfere with or destroy other mechanical systems.

The Cyclone feed concept first appeared on the Tippmann F/A as a spring-operated system that required manual rewinding.

=== Response Trigger System ===
The Response Trigger System is a firing system available for current production Tippmann paintball guns. The system uses a series of parts that are added to the gun to greatly increase the firing rate for the marker. The system uses excess carbon dioxide or compressed air from the firing process to reset the trigger and sear with a pneumatic cylinder. The cylinder can reset the trigger with only moderate pressure. When this happens, the pressure of the finger immediately pulls the trigger back again, firing another shot. If the operator utilizes the correct amount of pressure on the trigger, a &quot;bouncing&quot; effect occurs, resulting in fully automatic-like fire for the duration of the time that the operator can maintain that amount of pressure (commonly known as the &quot;sweet spot&quot;). As such, its use has been restricted to single-shot operation at some commercial paintball fields while banned completely at others.

The Response Trigger System is available on the 98 Custom, Custom Pro, A-5, and X-7 markers. It can also be installed in the Model 98 with modification (tapping the powertube and allowing space in the grip for the cylinder).

=== E-Grip ===
The E-Grip is an electronic means of firing the marker. Utilizing battery-operated components, the E-Grip replaces the trigger function, to where the trigger simply closes a micro switch. The switch sends a signal to a small circuit board, activating a solenoid. The solenoid uses a push rod to actuate the sear in this system. The board has multiple firing modes, allowing semi-automatic, burst, automatic and other modes. A few models of boards are available from different manufacturers, with different features, but the same dimensions to fit into the guides in the grip.

The term E-Grip is usually applied to the system in the A-5 and X-7 markers because they use a removable grip frame that contains all the electronics. The term E-Trigger is applied to the US Army and 98 Custom lines.

=== Flatline Barrel System ===
The Flatline barrel is a curved paintball barrel using a slight arch in combination with a rough inner surface texture to create backspin on the ball which flattens the trajectory. The range can increase to upwards of ( over a standard barrel). With a regular paintball barrel, a player will often have to raise the angle at which he/she is shooting in order to reach the opposing player. The accuracy of this barrel system is dependent on more factors than a standard barrel. With backspin being put on the paintball, inconsistency in the shape of a paintball will create unusual trajectories. Another disadvantage is its tendency to break thin shelled paintballs more easily due to the increased friction. However, this can be remedied by avoiding the use of low-grade paintballs.

The 98 Custom Flatline barrel must be re-adjusted for accuracy whenever it is removed and reinstalled. Therefore, it&#x27;s a good idea to &quot;mark&quot; where the barrel is aligned for reinstallment. The barrel is surrounded by a plastic shroud that hides the curved barrel and integrates a sight system replacing the marker sight, this is required as the barrel curves above the marker&#x27;s normal sight system. The shroud also has a picatinny rail for mounting accessories that attach onto a rail system.

The A-5 Flatline barrel doesn&#x27;t change the normal sight rail system. It resembles a large suppressor though it does not operate as one - in fact the barrel system does not have any porting and is therefore louder than a typical paintball barrel. The A-5 Flatline system can be removed and installed to the same position, making it unnecessary to adjust, unlike its predecessor.

It is also important to keep the marker adjusted to no more than , being the most effective velocity, for higher velocities cause paintballs to curve upwards before reaching their maximum distance, which in turn decreases the barrel&#x27;s normally high effective range. Tilting the barrel to the left or right will also cause the trajectory to be altered in that direction.

=== Paint Grenades ===
Tippmann offers a small line of paintball grenades, all using the same basic design but coming in a variety of sizes. Due to the safety hazards and field regulations of using explosives, they use an expanded bladder filled with a paint mix similar to that in a paintball. To activate them, the user releases a clasp and throws the grenade, to which releases its contact and spins upon impact. In 2013, Tippmann re-designed their larger grenade, the &quot;Big Boy&quot; to have a pull-pin type clasp to simulate a real grenade pin.

== Previous and Discontinued products ==
=== Alpha Black ===
The &quot;Alpha Black&quot; (Bravo One outside the US) is a blowback design using the 98 Custom internals but instead using &quot;clamshell&quot; body halves molded to resemble the M16. To date, there are 4 different versions of the Alpha Black currently being sold by Tippmann. The &quot;Basic&quot; version is simply the Alpha Black with nothing else but the barrel. The &quot;Tactical&quot; version comes with a molded plastic M16 styled handguard, barrel and a 6-position collapsible stock. The &quot;Tactical PowerPack&quot; comes with all of the Tactical aesthetic upgrades plus a tank, a 200-round gravity hopper and the TP420 goggle system. The &quot;Tactical + eGrip&quot; comes with everything the Tactical version does but with the added eGrip internals to allow for burst fire and full-auto shooting.

The Alpha Black can also be found sold with a Digital Camo finish but only in the Tactical version. The handguard, grip panels and stock are also molded out of a different color plastic to match.

Tippmann also produces upgrades for the Alpha Black including the eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The Alpha Black utilizes the same &quot;quick-thread&quot; design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom Flatline and barrel upgrades can be used.

It is still commonly found.

=== Custom Pro ===
The Tippmann &quot;Custom Pro&quot; was an upgraded version of the 98 Custom. It featured a double trigger, drop-forward, longer barrel, and later models had Anti-chop technology. The marker also featured a scratch-resistant powdercoat on later models, and also had models that utilized the E-Trigger system.

=== X-7 ===
On November 20, 2006, Tippmann launched their X-7 marker product line in cooperation with Special Ops Paintball. Tippmann marketed the X-7 as the most customizable marker on the market. The marker was sold as either a basic model, a response trigger edition or an E-grip edition (the latter using a Hall effect sensor for select fire modes).

It had a mechanical design similar to the A-5, while featuring an upgraded cyclone feed that can achieve up to 20 balls per second. Accessories built specifically for the A-5 receiver could not be used with the X-7 (and vice versa). It featured a MilSim body design, including an array of picatinny rails, a strong lightweight magnesium receiver, a low profile cyclone hopper, and an M16 magazine shaped tool kit.

=== C-3 ===
The C-3, with PEP technology, was a paintball marker produced by Tippmann - and is the first paintball marker to run on propane. The C-3 was discontinued in 2006, and no plans have been announced to release another propane-powered marker.

=== SMG ===
The SMG-60 was the first fully automatic paintball marker on the market. It is modeled on the appearance of the British STEN of World War II. The marker is .62 caliber, has a fixed steel barrel, and uses three stripper clips of five balls each (or four clips if using the extended 20-round magazine); the fire rate is 10 paintballs per second, therefore an entire standard magazine can be emptied in about 1.5 seconds. The rate of fire was deliberately limited by the use of a heavy hammer and maintained by a valve designed to use liquid . Some versions offered a 2-stage trigger (similar to those on firearms such as the Steyr AUG) in which a short pull produces semi-automatic fire and a long pull produces full-auto.

The SMG-68 is a .68 caliber version of the SMG-60, configured for semi-automatic operation, and featuring a removable barrel. Tippmann offered a trade-in for SMG-68&#x27;s to be converted into &quot;68 Specials&quot;, by adding a front bolt and external linkage arm.

=== SL-68 ===
The SL-68 was a pump gun designed for improved durability over prior product designs. The body was constructed from a cast and machined magnesium aluminum alloy, and the hopper adapter was integrated into the body casting, reducing the overall number of parts. The pump handle was originally manufactured with a cast metal, but was later replaced with a fiber-reinforced plastic. A squeegee could be stored in the pump handle, and a breech port could be used to quickly clean the barrel.

=== 68 Special ===
The 68 Special was an inline poppet valve design. It was a retrofit of the SMG-60/68, designed to fire from a hopper instead of clips. The rear half of the body is identical to the SMG (early conversions even retained the &quot;SMG 68&quot; sticker), while the front half was cut off and replaced with a hopper fed breach. A bolt and external linkage arm was also added. One interesting feature about this gun is that the hammer can be moved out of position into a safety position preventing the gun from being able to fire, like the PMI-3/VM-68 and firearms such as the Sten and MP40. It had a built-in back bottle setup that ran on liquid and was very inefficient, due to the small valve and heavy hammer (nearly 1 pound). It was one of the first semi-auto markers on the market, and cycled at 6 balls per second - very fast considering the loader technology at the time.

=== SL-68 II ===

A pump marker, the Tippmann SL-68 II superseded the original SL-68, adding anti-double feed and modified breech features. Most importantly, the constant-air adapter was relocated to an ergonomic position in the base of the cast grip frame meaning that players could easily aim with a full mask on. It was discontinued in 2003, reintroduced to the market in 2009, and then discontinued again in 2012.

=== Pro-AM ===
The Pro-Am is an open bolt semi-automatic marker. Early models had cast metal foregrips and pistol grips (the Pro-Am), while later models had composite foregrips and grip frames (the Pro-Lite). The loader connection was built into the foregrip, and by clicking the foregrip forward with a sear at the front of the gun the paint was kept from feeding, and the breech became open to clean the gun with a pull through squeegee. This allowed a player to clean the gun really fast with a pull through squeegee, without removing the barrel or removing the loader. Like all Tippmann markers, the Pro-Am was nearly indestructible and an extremely reliable gun. While the Pro-Am was like the 68 Special in layout, being an inline poppet valve design, it was a major change in design, with a different body, valve, breech, hammer, hammer to bolt linkage, and sear arrangements. Additionally, the tank was moved to below the grip frame for better balance and to allow different bottom line arrangements and stocks, instead of the Lone Star (M-16 style) grip that had been on the previous Tippmann Semi/Full Auto lines. It was also the first Tippmann Semi-Auto that didn&#x27;t require a siphon tank to run liquid , even though it could in colder weather without any problems.

=== Pro-Lite\Mini-Lite ===
The Pro-Lite is a semi-automatic open bolt marker. It is nearly identical to the Pro-Am differing only in the materials used to make the foregrip and pistol grip. The Pro-Lite used composite plastic while early Pro-Ams used cast metal foregrips and pistol grips (later Pro-Am models used composite foregrips). The difference in materials made the Pro-Lite considerably lighter than its predecessor. Like the Pro-Am, the Pro-Lite was designed for durability and is extremely reliable. Paintball Fields commonly used Pro-Lites as rentals because of their ease of maintenance and ability to take extreme abuse. The Mini-Lite is essentially a Pro-Lite with an extra CA adapter mounted just behind the foregrip.

=== Factory F/A ===
The F/A was a select fire, force fed, blowback paintball gun based on the Pro-Am/Pro-Lite body, with the Star feed apparatus on the side. It can be said that the F/A&#x27;s Star feed, which is close in function to the modern Cyclone feed, is the predecessor to the A-5. The F/A could be switched between safe, semi, and fully automatic firing via a fire selector lever. The full-auto setting changed the sear from a disconnecting version (used in semi-auto) to a full open sear. It used a hydraulic key/linkage/shock style system to slow the rate of fire by dragging 2 sets of keys on the top of the hammer. Although the rate of fire was adjustable from a few shots a second to around 20, the adjustments were seen as &quot;tricky&quot; by some users (although that was a small price to pay for such awesome firepower). Also, the Star feed required manual winding, and no other loaders on the market could feed a marker at that rate of fire. This feed system was prone to breaking paint, partially due to the spring tension, and partially due to the heavy action of older Tippmanns. The F/A, like the Pro-Lite and Carbine series, shares barrel threading and basic valve design with the A-5.

=== Pro-Carbine and .68 Carbine ===
The .68 Carbine was developed as a lighter and more customizable version of the Pro-Lite, featuring a .45 grip frame, a simplified feed neck that was not part of the forearm grip, and now-standard bottom line ASA adapter. Like the Pro-Lite, it was durable, accurate, and required minimal maintenance. The feed neck turned out to be the only weak spot, which led to the development of a new model, a combination of the Pro-Lite forearm breech and the Carbine receiver. This new model was named the Pro-Carbine. Pro-Carbine Barrels will fit Pro-Lite, .68 Carbine, and A-5 Models. They will NOT fit the Model 98.

The Pro-Carbine is a popular rental gun at paintball fields. It is semi-automatic and is known for its durability and reliable function. The Pro-Carbine is also known for its &quot;rifle-like&quot; forearm grip and Thompson SMG Style Action (even though it&#x27;s only a Mechanical Semi Automatic). This gives the gun an appearance that is similar to that of a real-life rifle. It is a popular woodsball/scenario marker due to its focused upgradability toward MilSim, but is less popular in speedball or Tourney games due to its handling, weight characteristics and slower rate of fire.

=== Model 98 ===
The Tippmann model 98 is the original version of the 98 custom.
One of the workhorses of the Tippmann line, it has been superseded by the 98 Custom and the Custom Pro.

The shells were redesigned for the model 98 custom key changes included:
* a removable trigger guard (previously part of the shell)
* elimination of the gills on the front of the marker
* internal changes to the shells to allow the addition of other aftermarket parts namely the reactive trigger system.

Special Note: New style thread flatline barrels will fit both the old thread and new thread guns.

=== Triumph ===
The .68 caliber &quot;Triumph&quot; series was launched in 2006 by Tippman Pneumatics; the marker is an entry-level model, which departs from the Tippman standard MilSim design. The three basic models include the &quot;XL&quot; semi-automatic (with basic barrel), &quot;XT&quot; semi-automatic (adding an expansion chamber, front grip assembly and 11-inch barrel), and &quot;eXT Electronic&quot; - which operates at fully automatic twelve or fifteen BPS, single-shot, or three round burst. The markers all feature a high-impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed neck, in-line bolt system and a 200-round gravity feed hopper.

<text>Baschurch is a village and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It lies in the north of Shropshire. The village had a population of 2,503 as of the 2011 census. Shrewsbury is to the south-east, Oswestry is to the north-west, and Wem is to the north-east of Baschurch. The village is also close to Ruyton-XI-Towns.

==History==
The earliest references to Baschurch are under its Welsh name &quot;Eglwyssau Bassa&quot; (Churches of Bassa), in a seven-stanza &quot;englyn&quot;-poem of the same name found in the Welsh cycle of poems called &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;, generally thought to date to the ninth century:

The English name &quot;Baschurch&quot; first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bascherche&quot;, and both names may derive from an Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Bass(a)&quot;. Thus the name in &quot;Canu Heledd&quot; is a Brittonic version of an English name.

Local tradition holds that the Berth Pool and its ancient earthworks outside the village are the resting place of the legendary King Arthur.

In medieval times, several properties in the parish, including Adcote Mill, were owned by Haughmond Abbey near Shrewsbury.

Baschurch had a township called Boreatton, or Bratton, standing on the banks of the River Perry, with a country house called Bratton House.

The world&#x27;s first orthopaedic hospital was established at Florence House in Baschurch by Sir Robert Jones and Dame Agnes Hunt in 1900 as a convalescent home for crippled children and later to treat wounded from the First World War. The hospital moved to Oswestry in 1921.

In 2000 a large stone made of local sandstone was erected in the modern centre of the village to commemorate the Millennium. Similar smaller stones were erected in neighbouring communities.

==Churches==
A major feature of the village is All Saints&#x27; Church (Church of England) which is one of the oldest standing structures in the village (perhaps &quot;the&quot; oldest). A timber church which burnt down is believed to have stood on the same site previously. Leading engineer and builder Thomas Telford made numerous major alterations to the modern sandstone church.

The village also had a Methodist chapel which was built in 1873 and closed in 2014 after the congregation had &quot;dwindled to less than a dozen&quot;. It was sold for conversion into a house in April 2015.

== Twin town ==
Baschurch is twinned with the town of Giat in the French &quot;département&quot; of Puy-de-Dôme, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes &quot;région&quot;.
==Education==
The village has two schools including Baschurch Church of England Primary School, and the Corbet School formerly known as Baschurch Secondary Modern School. Just outside the village is Walford College, an agricultural and sports college which in 2002 merged with Oswestry-based North Shropshire College to form Walford and North Shropshire College.

==Amenities==
Baschurch has a number of amenities including a post office, a retained Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service fire station and a village hall located on Eyton Lane next to the Corbet School.

==Railways==
The Shrewsbury to Chester Line passes through the village, though the Victorian railway station was closed to passengers in 1960 and goods trains in 1965.

On 13 February 1961 a passenger train travelling from Shrewsbury to Chester collided with a goods train which was partially shunted into a siding in Baschurch. Three people died in the accident. Television footage of the wreckage is available from the BBC.

There have been repeated efforts to bring the railway station back into use, most recently in autumn 2008, with the support of Baschurch Parish Council and the Shrewsbury-Chester Rail Users&#x27; Association. In September 2009, a public meeting organised by the Baschurch Station Group, was attended by 250 local people and received extensive media coverage.

==Broadband internet==
Baschurch was one of just six places in the United Kingdom to succeed in a competition held by BT to get super-fast broadband. The winners of the &quot;Race to Infinity&quot; competition were announced on 6 January 2011 and Baschurch came sixth. BT originally promised that only the top 5 places would go through with the upgrade (involving optic fibre-based infrastructure), but were impressed enough by the response in Baschurch. As of March 2018 much of the village has yet to be connected to super-fast broadband.

<doc id="466191" wikidata="Q1390901" url="?curid=466191" title="Leander Starr Jameson">
<text>Sir Leander Starr Jameson, 1st Baronet, (9 February 1853 – 26 November 1917), also known as Starr Jameson, was a British colonial politician, who was best known for his involvement in the ill-fated Jameson Raid.

==Early life and family==

He was born on 9 February 1853, the youngest of 12 children of Robert William Jameson (1805–1868), a Writer to the Signet, and Christian Pringle, daughter of Major-General Pringle of Symington House. 

Leander Starr Jameson was born at Stranraer, Wigtownshire (now part of Dumfries and Galloway), a great-nephew of Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. Fort&#x27;s biography of Jameson notes that Starr&#x27;s &quot;chief Gamaliel, however, was a Professor Grant, a man of advanced age, who had been a pupil of his great-uncle, the Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh.&quot;

Robert William Jameson started his career as an advocate in Edinburgh, and was Writer to the Signet, before becoming a playwright, published poet and editor of &quot;The Wigtownshire Free Press&quot;. A radical and reformist, he was the author of the dramatic poem &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1848) and &quot;Timoleon&quot;, a tragedy in five acts informed by the anti-slavery movement. &quot;Timoleon&quot; was performed at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh in 1852, and ran to a second edition. In due course, the Jameson family moved to London, living in Chelsea and Kensington. Leander Starr Jameson went to the Godolphin School in Hammersmith, where he did well in both lessons and games prior to his university education.

Leander was educated for the medical profession at University College Hospital, London, for which he passed his entrance examinations in January 1870. He distinguished himself as a medical student, becoming a Gold Medallist in &quot;materia medica&quot;. After qualifying as a doctor, he was made Resident Medical Officer at University College Hospital (M.R.C.S. 1875; M.D. 1877). After acting as house physician, house surgeon and demonstrator of anatomy, and showing promise of a successful professional career in London, his health broke down from overwork in 1878, and he went out to South Africa and settled down in practice at Kimberley. There he rapidly acquired a great reputation as a medical man, and, besides numbering President Kruger and the Matabele chief Lobengula among his patients, came much into contact with Cecil Rhodes.

Jameson was for some time the inDuna of the Matabele king&#x27;s favourite regiment, the Imbeza. Lobengula expressed his delight with Jameson&#x27;s successful medical treatment of his gout by honouring him with the rare status of inDuna. Although white, he underwent the initiation ceremonies linked with this honour. His status as an inDuna gave him certain advantages. In 1888, he successfully exerted his influence with Lobengula to induce the chieftain to grant the concessions to the agents of Rhodes which led to the formation of the British South Africa Company; and when the company proceeded to open up Mashonaland, Jameson abandoned his medical practice and joined the pioneer expedition of 1890. From this time his fortunes were bound up with Rhodes&#x27; schemes in the north. Immediately after the pioneer column had occupied Mashonaland, Jameson, with F.C. Selous and A.R. Colquhoun, went east to Manicaland and was instrumental in securing the greater part of the country, to which Portugal was laying claim, for the Chartered Company. In 1891, Jameson succeeded Colquhoun as Administrator of Mashonaland. In 1893, Jameson was a key figure in the First Matabele War and involved in incidents that led to the massacre of the Shangani Patrol.

==Character==
Elizabeth Longford wrote of him, &quot;Whatever one felt about him or his projects when he was not there, one could not help falling for the man in his presence... People attached themselves to Jameson with extraordinary fervour, the more extraordinary because he made no effort to feed it. He affected an attitude of tough cynicism towards life, literature and any articulate form of idealism, particularly towards the hero-worship which he himself excited ... [After Starr&#x27;s death,] &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that his astonishing personal hold over his followers had been equalled only by that of Parnell, the Irish patriot.&quot;

Longford wrote that Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem &quot;If—&quot; with Leander Starr Jameson in mind as an inspiration for the characteristics he recommended young people to live by (notably Kipling&#x27;s son, to whom the poem is addressed in the last lines). Longford writes, &quot;Jameson was later to be the inspiration and hero of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem, &quot;If&quot;...&quot;. Direct evidence that the poem &quot;If—&quot; was written about Jameson is available also in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s autobiography in which Kipling writes that &quot;If—&quot; was &quot;drawn from Jameson&#x27;s character.&quot;
In 1895, Jameson led about 500 of his countrymen in what became known as the Jameson Raid against the Boers in southern Africa. The Jameson Raid was later cited by Winston Churchill as a major factor in bringing about the Boer War of 1899 to 1902. But the story as recounted in Britain was quite different. The British defeat was interpreted as a victory and Jameson was portrayed as a daring hero.

 wrote of L.S. Jameson in this way:&lt;poem&gt;... It was not his wont to talk at length, nor was he, unless exceptionally interested, a good listener. He was so logical and so quick to grasp a situation, that he would often cut short exposition by some forcible remark or personal raillery that would all too often quite disconcert the speaker.

Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences obviously bored him; he was always for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was a master of the art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...

... He wrapped himself in cynicism as with a cloak, not only to protect himself against his own quick human sympathy, but to conceal the austere standard of duty and honour that he always set to himself. He was ever trying to hide from his friends his real attitude towards life, and the high estimate he placed upon accepted ethical values... He was essentially a patriot who sought for himself neither wealth, nor power, nor fame, nor leisure, nor even an easy anchorage for reflection. The wide sphere of his work and achievements, and the accepted dominion of his personality and his influence were both based upon his adherence to the principle of always subordinating personal considerations to the work in hand, upon the loyalty of his service to big ideals. His whole life seems to illustrate the truth of the saying that in self-regard and self-centredness there is no profit, and that only in sacrificing himself for impersonal aims can a man save his soul and benefit his fellow men.&lt;/poem&gt;

A less flattering view is given in Antony Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Rhodes&quot; (1996), in which Jameson is portrayed as unscrupulous.

==The Jameson Raid==


In 1895, Jameson assembled a private army outside the Transvaal in preparation for the violent overthrow of the Boer government. The idea was to foment unrest among foreign workers (&quot;Uitlanders&quot;) in the territory, and use the outbreak of open revolt as an excuse to invade and annex the territory.

In November 1895, a piece of territory of strategic importance, the Pitsani Strip, part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and bordering the Transvaal, was ceded to the British South Africa Company by the Colonial Office, overtly for the protection of a railway running through the territory. Cecil Rhodes, the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and managing director of the company was eager to bring South Africa under British dominion, and encouraged the disenfranchised Uitlanders of the Boer republics to resist Afrikaner domination.

Rhodes hoped that the intervention of the company&#x27;s private army could spark an Uitlander uprising, leading to the overthrow of the Transvaal government. Rhodes&#x27; forces were assembled in the Pitsani Strip for this purpose. Joseph Chamberlain informed Salisbury on Boxing Day that an uprising was expected, and was aware that an invasion would be launched, but was not sure when. The subsequent Jameson Raid was a debacle, leading to the invading force&#x27;s surrender. Chamberlain, at Highbury Hall, his home in Birmingham, received a secret telegram from the Colonial Office on 31 December informing him of the beginning of the Raid.

Though sympathetic to the ultimate goals of the Raid, Chamberlain was uncomfortable with the timing of the invasion and remarked &quot;if this succeeds it will ruin me. I&#x27;m going up to London to crush it&quot;. He swiftly travelled by train to the Colonial Office, ordering Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of the Cape Colony, to repudiate the actions of Jameson and warned Rhodes that the company&#x27;s Charter would be in danger if it were discovered that the Cape Prime Minister were involved in the Raid. The prisoners were returned to London for trial, and the Transvaal government received considerable compensation from the company. Jameson was tried in England for leading the raid; during that time he was lionised by the press and London society.

==The Jameson Raid trial==
The Jameson Raiders arrived in England at the end of February 1896, to face prosecution under the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 styled &quot;R. v Jameson, Willoughby and others&quot;. There were some months of investigations initially held at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court, following which the trial at bar (a trial in front of multiple judges instead of a jury) began on 20 June 1896, at the High Court. The trial lasted seven days, following which Dr Jameson was &quot;found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant for fifteen months. He was, however, released from Holloway in the following December on account of illness.&quot;

During the trial of Jameson, Rhodes&#x27; solicitor, Bourchier Hawksley, refused to produce cablegrams that had passed between Rhodes and his agents in London during November and December 1895. According to Hawksley, these demonstrated that the Colonial Office &#x27;influenced the actions of those in South Africa&#x27; who embarked on the Raid, and even that Chamberlain had transferred control of the Pitsani Strip to facilitate an invasion. Nine days before the Raid, Chamberlain had asked his Assistant Under-Secretary to encourage Rhodes to &quot;hurry up&quot; because of the developing Venezuela Crisis of 1895.

The conduct of Dr Jameson during the trial was graphically described by , an eyewitness account of her observations during the Jameson Raid trial. She wrote:

Jameson was sentenced to fifteen months in gaol, but was soon pardoned. In June 1896, Chamberlain, British Colonial Secretary of the day, offered his resignation to Lord Salisbury, having shown the Prime Minister one or more of the cablegrams implicating him in the Raid&#x27;s planning. Salisbury refused to accept the offer, possibly reluctant to lose the government&#x27;s most popular figure. Salisbury reacted aggressively in support of Chamberlain, supporting the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s threat to withdraw the company&#x27;s charter if the cablegrams were revealed. Accordingly, Rhodes refused to reveal the cablegrams, and as no evidence was produced showing that Chamberlain was complicit in the Raid&#x27;s planning, the Select Committee appointed to investigate the events surrounding the Raid had no choice but to absolve Chamberlain of all responsibility.

Jameson had been Administrator General for Matabeleland at the time of the Raid and his intrusion into Transvaal depleted Matabeleland of many of its troops and left the whole territory vulnerable. Seizing on this weakness, and a discontent with the British South Africa Company, the Matabele revolted in March 1896 in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First War of Independence – the Second Matabele War. Hundreds of white settlers were killed within the first few weeks and many more would die over the next year and a half at the hands of both the Matabele and the Shona. With few troops to support them, the settlers had to quickly build a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own. Against over 50,000 Matabele held up in their stronghold of the Matobo Hills as the settlers mounted patrols under Burnham, Baden-Powell, and Selous. After the Matabele laid down their arms, the war continued until October 1897 in Mashonaland.

==Later political career==
Despite the Raid, Jameson had a successful political life following the invasion, receiving many honours in later life. In 1903, Jameson was put forward as the leader of the Progressive (British) Party in the Cape Colony. When the party was successful he served as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1904 to 1908. His government was unique in Cape history, as being the only Ministry to be composed exclusively of British politicians. 

During the Conference of Colonial Premiers held in London in March 1907, he was made a Privy Counsellor. He served as the leader of the Unionist Party (South Africa) from its founding in 1910 until 1912, when Starr returned to England. (Jameson was defeated in the election of September 1910 by the nationalist South African Party and never held political power.)

Jameson served as chairman of the Central Prisoners of War Committee from its establishment in 1916 until his death.

==Honours==

Leander Starr Jameson was awarded the:
* KCMG
* CB
* Freedom of the City of London for services to the British Empire 
* Freedom of the City of Manchester for services to the British Empire 
* Freedom of the City of Edinburgh for services to the British Empire 

Jameson was created a baronet in 1911.

==Death==
Sir Leander Starr Jameson, 1st Bt., died on the afternoon of Monday, 26 November 1917, at his home, 2 Great Cumberland Place, Hyde Park, in London. His body was laid in a vault at Kensal Green Cemetery on 29 November 1917, where it remained until 1920 when it was exhumed and reburied alongside Cecil Rhodes at Malindidzimu Hill, a granite hill in the Matobo National Park, south of Bulawayo. It was designated by Cecil Rhodes as the resting place for those who served Great Britain well in Africa.

==Biographies, portraits and honours==
Jameson&#x27;s life is the subject of a number of biographies, including &quot;The Life of Jameson&quot; by Ian Colvin (1922, Vol. 1 and 1923, Vol. 2), &quot;Dr. Jameson&quot; by G. Seymour Fort (1918), and &quot;The If Man&quot; by Chris Ash (2012). The Jameson Raid has been the subject of numerous articles and books, and remains a fascinating historical riddle more than one hundred years after the events of the Raid took place.

There are three portraits of Jameson in the National Portrait Gallery in London. One of these was by one of his elder brothers, Middleton Jameson, R.A. (1851–1919).

During the colonial period, the Zambian town of Chipata was named &quot;Fort Jameson&quot; in Jameson&#x27;s honour.

==Later historical documents==
In 2002, The Van Riebeck Society published &quot;Sir Graham Bower’s Secret History of the Jameson Raid and the South African Crisis, 1895–1902&quot;, adding to growing historical evidence that the imprisonment and judgment upon the Raiders at the time of their trial was an underhand move by the British government, a result of political manoeuvres by Joseph Chamberlain and his staff to hide his own involvement and knowledge of the Raid. In his review of &quot;Sir Graham Bower’s Secret History...&quot; Alan Cousins, notes that, &quot;A number of major themes and concerns emerge&quot; from Bower&#x27;s history, &quot;... perhaps the most poignant being Sir Graham Bower&#x27;s accounts of his being made a scapegoat in the aftermath of the raid: &#x27;since a scapegoat was wanted I was willing to serve my country in that capacity&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Two physical systems are in thermal equilibrium if there is no net flow of thermal energy between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat. Thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics. A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially uniform and temporally constant.

Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are always in thermal equilibrium, but the converse is not always true. If the connection between the systems allows transfer of energy as &#x27;change in internal energy&#x27; but does not allow transfer of matter or transfer of energy as work, the two systems may reach thermal equilibrium without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Two varieties of thermal equilibrium ==

===Relation of thermal equilibrium between two thermally connected bodies===
The relation of thermal equilibrium is an instance of equilibrium between two bodies, which means that it refers to transfer through a selectively permeable partition of matter or work; it is called a diathermal connection. According to Lieb and Yngvason, the essential meaning of the relation of thermal equilibrium includes that it is reflexive and symmetric. It is not included in the essential meaning whether it is or is not transitive. After discussing the semantics of the definition, they postulate a substantial physical axiom, that they call the &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot;, that thermal equilibrium is a transitive relation. They comment that the equivalence classes of systems so established are called isotherms.

===Internal thermal equilibrium of an isolated body===
Thermal equilibrium of a body in itself refers to the body when it is isolated. The background is that no heat enters or leaves it, and that it is allowed unlimited time to settle under its own intrinsic characteristics. When it is completely settled, so that macroscopic change is no longer detectable, it is in its own thermal equilibrium. It is not implied that it is necessarily in other kinds of internal equilibrium. For example, it is possible that a body might reach internal thermal equilibrium but not be in internal chemical equilibrium; glass is an example.

One may imagine an isolated system, initially not in its own state of internal thermal equilibrium. It could be subjected to a fictive thermodynamic operation of partition into two subsystems separated by nothing, no wall. One could then consider the possibility of transfers of energy as heat between the two subsystems. A long time after the fictive partition operation, the two subsystems will reach a practically stationary state, and so be in the relation of thermal equilibrium with each other. Such an adventure could be conducted in indefinitely many ways, with different fictive partitions. All of them will result in subsystems that could be shown to be in thermal equilibrium with each other, testing subsystems from different partitions. For this reason, an isolated system, initially not its own state of internal thermal equilibrium, but left for a long time, practically always will reach a final state which may be regarded as one of internal thermal equilibrium. Such a final state is one of spatial uniformity or homogeneity of temperature. The existence of such states is a basic postulate of classical thermodynamics. This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the minus first law of thermodynamics. A notable exception exists for isolated quantum systems which are many-body localized and which &quot;never&quot; reach internal thermal equilibrium.

==Thermal contact==

Heat can flow into or out of a closed system by way of thermal conduction or of thermal radiation to or from a thermal reservoir, and when this process is effecting net transfer of heat, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. While the transfer of energy as heat continues, the system&#x27;s temperature can be changing.

==Bodies prepared with separately uniform temperatures, then put into purely thermal communication with each other==

If bodies are prepared with separately microscopically stationary states, and are then put into purely thermal connection with each other, by conductive or radiative pathways, they will be in thermal equilibrium with each other just when the connection is followed by no change in either body. But if initially they are not in a relation of thermal equilibrium, heat will flow from the hotter to the colder, by whatever pathway, conductive or radiative, is available, and this flow will continue until thermal equilibrium is reached and then they will have the same temperature.

One form of thermal equilibrium is radiative exchange equilibrium. Two bodies, each with its own uniform temperature, in solely radiative connection, no matter how far apart, or what partially obstructive, reflective, or refractive, obstacles lie in their path of radiative exchange, not moving relative to one another, will exchange thermal radiation, in net the hotter transferring energy to the cooler, and will exchange equal and opposite amounts just when they are at the same temperature. In this situation, Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity and the Helmholtz reciprocity principle are in play.

==Change of internal state of an isolated system==

If an initially isolated physical system, without internal walls that establish adiabatically isolated subsystems, is left long enough, it will usually reach a state of thermal equilibrium in itself, in which its temperature will be uniform throughout, but not necessarily a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, if there is some structural barrier that can prevent some possible processes in the system from reaching equilibrium; glass is an example. Classical thermodynamics in general considers idealized systems that have reached internal equilibrium, and idealized transfers of matter and energy between them.

An isolated physical system may be inhomogeneous, or may be composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls. If an initially inhomogeneous physical system, without internal walls, is isolated by a thermodynamic operation, it will in general over time change its internal state. Or if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls, it may change its state after a thermodynamic operation that changes its walls. Such changes may include change of temperature or spatial distribution of temperature, by changing the state of constituent materials. A rod of iron, initially prepared to be hot at one end and cold at the other, when isolated, will change so that its temperature becomes uniform all along its length; during the process, the rod is not in thermal equilibrium until its temperature is uniform. In a system prepared as a block of ice floating in a bath of hot water, and then isolated, the ice can melt; during the melting, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually, its temperature will become uniform; the block of ice will not re-form. A system prepared as a mixture of petrol vapour and air can be ignited by a spark and produce carbon dioxide and water; if this happens in an isolated system, it will increase the temperature of the system, and during the increase, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually, the system will settle to a uniform temperature.

Such changes in isolated systems are irreversible in the sense that while such a change will occur spontaneously whenever the system is prepared in the same way, the reverse change will practically never occur spontaneously within the isolated system; this is a large part of the content of the second law of thermodynamics. Truly perfectly isolated systems do not occur in nature, and always are artificially prepared.

===In a gravitational field===

One may consider a system contained in a very tall adiabatically isolating vessel with rigid walls initially containing a thermally heterogeneous distribution of material, left for a long time under the influence of a steady gravitational field, along its tall dimension, due to an outside body such as the earth. It will settle to a state of uniform temperature throughout, though not of uniform pressure or density, and perhaps containing several phases. It is then in internal thermal equilibrium and even in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform. This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Considerations of kinetic theory or statistical mechanics also support this statement.

==Distinctions between thermal and thermodynamic equilibria==

There is an important distinction between thermal and thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Münster (1970), in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, the state variables of a system do not change at a measurable rate. Moreover, &quot;The proviso &#x27;at a measurable rate&#x27; implies that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.&quot; Also, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium can be described by fewer macroscopic variables than any other state of a given body of matter. A single isolated body can start in a state which is not one of thermodynamic equilibrium, and can change till thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium is a relation between two bodies or closed systems, in which transfers are allowed only of energy and take place through a partition permeable to heat, and in which the transfers have proceeded till the states of the bodies cease to change.

An explicit distinction between &#x27;thermal equilibrium&#x27; and &#x27;thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; is made by C.J. Adkins. He allows that two systems might be allowed to exchange heat but be constrained from exchanging work; they will naturally exchange heat till they have equal temperatures, and reach thermal equilibrium, but in general, will not be in thermodynamic equilibrium. They can reach thermodynamic equilibrium when they are allowed also to exchange work.

Another explicit distinction between &#x27;thermal equilibrium&#x27; and &#x27;thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which several irreversible processes are occurring. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then &quot;it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.&quot;

==Thermal equilibrium of planets==

A planet is in thermal equilibrium when the incident energy reaching it (typically the solar irradiance from its parent star) is equal to the infrared energy radiated away to space.

<doc id="466196" wikidata="Q935354" url="?curid=466196" title="T Tauri">
<text>T Tauri is a trinary variable star in the constellation Taurus, the prototype of the T Tauri stars. It was discovered in October 1852 by John Russell Hind. T Tauri appears from Earth amongst the Hyades cluster, not far from ε Tauri, but it is actually 420 light-years behind it and not a member of the cluster. The cloud to the west of the system is NGC 1555, known more commonly as Hind&#x27;s Variable Nebula.

Although this system is considered to be the prototype of T Tauri stars, a later phase in a protostar&#x27;s formation, it is a very atypical T Tauri star.

== Orbital characteristics and mass ==
The system has three stars: T Tauri North (T Tau N), T Tauri South A (T Tau Sa), and T Tauri South B (T Tau Sb). T Tau N is estimated to be approximately 300 AU away from the southern binary, with the separation of the binary believed to be approximately 7 AU with an orbital period of 27.2±0.7 years. The orbit of T Tau N about the southern binary is poorly constrained, with the period ranging from 400 years to 14,000 years as of 2020. T Tau N has a mass of ~, T Tau Sa is estimated to be , and T Tau Sb is estimated to be approximately .
== Variability and optical extinction ==

The southern binary is visible mainly in infrared, which is likely due to a circumbinary ring that is blocking the optical light (if there is any optical light leaking through, it must be at a magnitude of less than 19.6), while the accretion disk of T Tau N is believed to be nearly perpendicular to our line of sight, thus allowing us to see T Tau N in the optical.

The southern binary&#x27;s brightness varies dramatically over seemingly short timescales in the infrared. It is believed this variability is due to both the matter in the circumbinary ring not being uniform, thus varying the light let through as it orbits the binary, and due to the individual components of the binary flaring up as they accrete matter. It is unknown which mechanism contributes the most to the variability.

The T Tau S system is seen moving towards the north-west and two works predicted that the circumbinary ring around T Tau S will move in front of T Tau N within 100 years. Based on AAVSO observations it was found that between 2015 and 2024 the star did fade by around 2 magnitudes. This is interpreted as the beginning of the great dimming of T Tau N. The dimming will last 60 to 70 years or more and T Tau N might disappear in the optical when the dense mid-plane of the ring moves in front of T Tau N.
== Outflow system ==
All three stars are believed to be in the T Tauri phase. During this phase, a star does not undergo nuclear fusion within its core; it shines due to the residual heat given off by its collapse. This causes a T Tauri star to vary in brightness over the course of weeks or months as they accrete matter. An important mechanic in star formation are the jets that are formed by the accretion, which function similarly to the jets of a quasar or an active galactic nucleus (AGN). These jets form due to the magnetic fields formed in the accretion disk, and as a side effect, they carry away excess angular momentum from the star. Without this mechanism, a star would not be able to accrete to more than .

As of 2020, T Tau Sb is passing through the plane of the T Tau S circumbinary ring, and is currently dimming as the ring blocks its light.

The T Tauri system has been of particular interest to astronomers because it is by no means a typical T Tauri star. Specifically, it appears that T Tau N is actually supposed to still be an embedded protostar, but it was likely ejected from the dense cloud it was born in sometime in the past few thousand years. It is almost certainly still gravitationally bound to the other two stars. Its spectra is exactly that of a Classic T Tauri Star (CTTS), but evolutionary speaking it is not a T Tauri star. 

The complex outflow system created by the stars is poorly understood, particularly in how it evolves over time. It is believed there are two bipolar outflows, with one coming from T Tau N, and the other coming from T Tau S. Since the two stars of T Tau S are so close, their individual outflows appear to either merge or T Tau Sb does not produce much of an outflow. The two outflows seem to be interacting somewhat, and it is believed this interaction will only become more intense in the future. 

== Surrounding nebulosity ==
Surrounding the system are three distinct Herbig-Haro objects. These are patches of nebulosity caused by the outflows interacting with the interstellar medium. They can be thought of as shock fronts for the jets as the fast moving material slams into the cold gas and dust surrounding the system.

The most noticeable nebulosity is the NGC 1555 cloud, known as Hind&#x27;s Variable Nebula, only an arcminute west of T Tauri. This was the nebulosity first discovered by Hind in 1852, which is now known to be a reflection nebula due to the spectra being very similar to that of T Tauri itself. It is thought that the nebula&#x27;s brightness varies due to material interposing occasionally between T Tauri and the reflection nebula. 

The darker nebulosity is not technically part Hind&#x27;s Variable Nebula, but it is part of the same cloud, and most catalogues consider them the same object. Various designations of this cloud are GC 839, HH 155, vdB 28, Ced 32b, SH 2-238, GN 04.18.9, and BDN176.28-20.89.

HH155 appears to be part of the NGC 1555 cloud, and is in fact a patch of emission nebulosity emanating from the blue-shifted east-west outflow from T Tau N. It stretches all the way to NGC 1555, and causes the reflection nebulosity to have some faint, in-situ forbidden line emission, which is produced by the fast-moving outflow interacting with the material at rest within NGC 1555.

HH255 is nebulosity much closer to the star system itself, otherwise known as Burnham&#x27;s Nebula (also known as Ced 32c). It is another patch of emission nebulosity, likely caused by the outflows of the individual stars interacting and the outflows escaping the dense inner regions of the star system. 

When Sherburne Wesley Burnham used the new 36&quot; Great Lick Refractor in 1890 to find Hind&#x27;s Nebula, which had been intermittently missing since the 1860s, he mistakenly inspected T Tauri itself rather than the area immediately west, and was successful in finding a nebula. When he noticed the description of Hind&#x27;s Nebula did not match what he was seeing, he asked his colleague Edward Emerson Barnard to take a look since he had more experience with nebulosity and finer eyes. Barnard discovered another nebula, approximately an arcminute south-west of T Tauri and about an arcminute in diameter. This nebula Barnard found was temporarily called Barnard&#x27;s Nebula until it was realized to be Hind later in the decade, and the nebulosity found around T Tauri was named Burnham&#x27;s Nebula. This would be the first ever discovered Herbig-Haro object, although the object class would not be coined until 1953.

HH355 is a so-called &quot;giant outflow&quot; that reaches nearly 1.5pc away from the star system, discovered in 1997. This outflow is unusually large, possibly explained by the ejection of T Tau N from a closer, chaotic orbit with T Tau Sa and Sb many thousands of years ago. The patches are easily observed using the H-Alpha emission line, and by measuring the Doppler Shift of the two lobes, it appears they originated from the T Tau system. The lobes, referred to as HH355 North and HH355 South, each have three major patches (totaling six overall). The northern lobe has patches A, B, and C; the southern lobe has patches D, E, and F. The patches were seemingly created in pairs, with patches A and F being created 5000 years ago, B and E 900 years later, and C and D 900 years after that (assuming a tangential velocity of 150 km/s, which is a fairly common outflow velocity). After the last pair was created, a period of relative quiescence followed.

==Planetary system==
As typical for the young stars, all three stars of T Tauri system are surrounded by a compact disks trimmed by star-star interaction. The disk around T Tauri N has a gap around 12 AU radius, indicating a presence of orbiting Saturn-mass planet within a gap.



== Struve&#x27;s Lost Nebula ==
The nebula NGC 1554 (Ced 32a) is believed to be associated with T Tauri. In the 1860s, Hind&#x27;s nebula had faded from view for nearly all astronomers on Earth, including Hind himself, but Otto Wilhelm von Struve, having the third most powerful telescope in the world at the time, could still see it. In 1868, Struve lost the nebula, but found a new patch of nebulosity approximately four arcminutes west that he believed to be distinct from Hind&#x27;s Nebula. He did not bother properly reporting this due to his lack of interest in nebulae, and instead wrote privately to d&#x27;Arrest, who would publish the finding. Over the course of the next 10-20 years, Struve&#x27;s Nebula faded from view, and Hind&#x27;s Nebula came back into view of most astronomers at the same time. It is likely Struve truly did observe something, especially considering that d&#x27;Arrest confirmed it, but as of 2022 there is no agreed explanation for the cause of this phenomenon. 

The exact dynamics of the outflow system of T Tauri, particularly its evolution, is poorly understood. It is possible some sort of interaction between the outflows in the past may have caused the phenomena that Struve observed, but more data on at least the orbital constraints of T Tau N and how the outflows interact currently will be needed before any concrete theory can be reached. More likely than not, T Tau N underwent an ejection from the southern binary T Tau S into an eccentric and large orbit a few thousand years ago (based on the age of the HH 355 lobes), and Struve&#x27;s Nebula may have been related somehow, but this is purely speculative.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2014 video game &quot;Elite: Dangerous&quot;, the star system and surrounding nebula are featured as a location that players can visit. It is slightly further from Earth in the game than real life, and incorrectly simulates the star system itself, with T Tau N being represented by a main-sequence G-type star, and T Tau S being represented by a similar main-sequence G-type star (instead of a binary with two T Tauri stars). Notably, there is a small starport in the system called Hind&#x27;s Mine that is in the ring system of a fictional gas giant in orbit of T Tau N, notable for its large distance from most other settled systems.

<text>Books on [[cryptography]] have been published sporadically and with variable quality for a long time. This is despite the paradox that secrecy is of the essence in sending confidential messages – see Kerckhoffs&#x27; principle.

In contrast, the revolutions in cryptography and secure communications since the 1970s are covered in the available literature.

==Early history==
An early example of a book about cryptography was a Roman work, now lost and known only by references. Many early cryptographic works were esoteric, mystical, and/or reputation-promoting; cryptography being mysterious, there was much opportunity for such things. At least one work by Trithemius was banned by the Catholic Church and put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum as being about black magic or witchcraft. Many writers claimed to have invented unbreakable ciphers. None were, though it sometimes took a long while to establish this.

In the 19th century, the general standard improved somewhat (e.g., works by Auguste Kerckhoffs, Friedrich Kasiski, and Étienne Bazeries). Colonel Parker Hitt and William Friedman in the early 20th century also wrote books on cryptography. These authors, and others, mostly abandoned any mystical or magical tone.

==Open literature versus classified literature==
With the invention of radio, much of military communications went wireless, allowing the possibility of enemy interception much more readily than tapping into a landline. This increased the need to protect communications. By the end of World War I, cryptography and its literature began to be officially limited. One exception was the 1931 book &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; by Herbert Yardley, which gave some insight into American cryptologic success stories, including the Zimmermann telegram and the breaking of Japanese codes during the Washington Naval Conference.

====&quot;The Codebreakers&quot;====
From the end of World War II until the early 1980s most aspects of modern cryptography were regarded as the special concern of governments and the military and were protected by custom and, in some cases, by statute. The most significant work to be published on cryptography in this period is undoubtedly David Kahn&#x27;s &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, which was published at a time (mid-1960s) when virtually no information on the modern practice of cryptography was available. Kahn has said that over ninety percent of its content was previously unpublished.

The book caused serious concern at the NSA despite its lack of coverage of specific modern cryptographic practice, so much so that after failing to prevent the book being published, NSA staff were informed to not even acknowledge the existence of the book if asked. In the US military, mere possession of a copy by cryptographic personnel was grounds for some considerable suspicion. Perhaps the single greatest importance of the book was the impact it had on the next generation of cryptographers. Whitfield Diffie has made comments in interviews about the effect it had on him.

===Cryptographic environment/context or security===
* Schneier, Bruce – &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, Wiley, , a discussion of the context within which cryptography and cryptosystems work. &quot;Practical Cryptography&quot; also includes some contextual material in the discussion of crypto system design.
* Schneier, Bruce – &quot;Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World&quot;, Wiley, 
* Anderson, Ross – &quot;Security Engineering&quot;, Wiley, (online version), advanced coverage of computer security issues, including cryptography. Covers much more than merely cryptography. Brief on most topics due to the breadth of coverage. Well written, especially compared to the usual standard.
* Edney, Jon and Arbaugh, William A – &quot;Real 802.11 Security: Wi-Fi Protected Access and 802.11i&quot;, Addison-Wesley, , covers the use of cryptography in Wi-Fi networks. Includes details on Wi-Fi Protected Access (which is based on the IEEE 802.11i specification). The book is slightly out of date as it was written before IEEE 802.11i was finalized but much of the content is still useful for those who want to find out how encryption and authentication is done in a Wi-Fi network.

===Declassified works===
*Boak, David G. &quot;A History of U.S. Communications Security (Volumes I and II); the David G. Boak Lectures,&quot; National Security Agency (NSA), 1973, A frank, detailed, and often humorous series of lectures delivered to new NSA hires by a long time insider, largely declassified as of 2015. 
*Callimahos, Lambros D. and Friedman, William F. Military Cryptanalytics. A (partly) declassified text intended as a training manual for NSA cryptanalysts.
* Friedman, William F., Six Lectures on Cryptology, National Cryptology School, U.S. National Security Agency, 1965, declassified 1977, 1984
* (How the Japanese Purple cipher was broken, declassified 2001)

===History of cryptography===
* Bamford, James, &quot;The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America&#x27;s Most Secret Agency&quot; (1982)(), and the more recent &quot;Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency&quot; (2001). The first is one of a very few books about the US Government&#x27;s NSA. The second is also about NSA but concentrates more on its history. There is some very interesting material in &quot;Body of Secrets&quot; about US attempts (the TICOM mission) to investigate German cryptographic efforts immediately as WW II wound down.
* Gustave Bertrand, &quot;Enigma ou la plus grande énigme de la guerre 1939–1945&quot; (Enigma: the Greatest Enigma of the War of 1939–1945), Paris, 1973. The first public disclosure in the West of the breaking of Enigma, by the chief of French military cryptography prior to WW II. The first public disclosure anywhere was made in the first edition of &quot;Bitwa o tajemnice&quot; by the late Władysław Kozaczuk.
* James Gannon, &quot;Stealing Secrets, Telling Lies: How Spies and Codebreakers Helped Shape the Twentieth Century&quot;, Washington, D.C., Brassey&#x27;s, 2001: an overview of major 20th-century episodes in cryptology and espionage, particularly strong regarding the misappropriation of credit for conspicuous achievements.
* Kahn, David – &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; (1967) () A single-volume source for cryptographic history, at least for events up to the mid-&#x27;60s (i.e., to just before DES and the public release of asymmetric key cryptography). The added chapter on more recent developments (in the most recent edition) is quite thin. Kahn has written other books and articles on cryptography, and on cryptographic history. They are very highly regarded.
* Kozaczuk, Władysław, &quot;Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War II&quot;, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, MD, 1984: a history of cryptological efforts against Enigma, concentrating on the contributions of Polish mathematicians Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski; of particular interest to specialists will be several technical appendices by Rejewski.
* Levy, Steven – &quot;&quot; (2001) (): a journalistic overview of the development of public cryptographic techniques and the US regulatory context for cryptography. This is an account of a major policy conflict.
* Singh, Simon, &quot;The Code Book&quot; (): an anecdotal introduction to the history of cryptography. Covers more recent material than does even the revised edition of Kahn&#x27;s &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;. Clearly written and quite readable. The included cryptanalytic contest has been won and the prize awarded, but the cyphertexts are still worth attempting.
* Bauer, F L, &quot;Decrypted Secrets&quot;, This book is unusual. It is both a history of cryptography, and a discussion of mathematical topics related to cryptography. In his review, David Kahn said he thought it the best book he&#x27;d read on the subject. It is essentially two books, in more or less alternating chapters. Originally in German, and the translation shows it in places. Some surprising content, e.g., in the discussion of President Edgar Hoover&#x27;s Secretary of State, Henry Stimson.
* Budiansky, Stephen, &quot;Battle of Wits&quot;: a one-volume history of cryptography in WW II. It is well written, well researched, and responsible. Technical material (e.g., a description of the cryptanalysis of Enigma) is limited, but clearly presented.
* Budiansky, Stephen, &quot;Code Warriors: NSA&#x27;s Codebreakers and the Secret Intelligence War Against the Soviet Union&quot; (Knopf, 2016). (): A sweeping, in-depth history of NSA, whose famous “cult of silence” has left the agency shrouded in mystery for decades.
* Prados, John – &quot;Combined Fleet Decoded&quot;, An account of cryptography in the Pacific Theatre of World War II with special emphasis on the Japanese side. Reflects extensive research in Japanese sources and recently available US material. Contains material not previously accessible or unavailable.
* Marks, Leo, &quot;Between Silk and Cyanide: a Codemaker&#x27;s Story, 1941–1945,&quot; (HarperCollins, 1998). (). A humorous but informative account of code-making and -breaking in Britain&#x27;s WWII Special Operations Executive.
* Mundy, Liza, &quot;Code Girls,&quot; (Hachette Books, 2017) () An account of some of the thousands of women recruited for U.S. cryptologic work before and during World War II, including top analysts such as Elizebeth Smith Friedman and Agnes Meyer Driscoll, lesser known but outstanding contributors like Genevieve Grotjan Feinstein and Ann Zeilinger Caracristi, and many others, and how the women made a strategic difference in the war.
*Yardley, Herbert, &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; (), a classic 1931 account of American code-breaking during and after World War I; and &quot;Chinese Black Chamber: An Adventure in Espionage&quot; (), about Yardley&#x27;s work with the Chinese government in the years just before World War II. Yardley has an enduring reputation for embellishment, and some of the material in these books is less than reliable. &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; was written after the New York operation Yardley ran was shut down by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson and the US Army, on the grounds that &quot;gentlemen don&#x27;t read each other&#x27;s mail&quot;.

<doc id="466207" wikidata="Q140619" url="?curid=466207" title="Nadia Boulanger">
<text>Juliette Nadia Boulanger (; 16 September 188722 October 1979) was a French music teacher, conductor and composer. She taught many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century, and also performed occasionally as a pianist and organist.

From a musical family, she achieved early honours as a student at the Conservatoire de Paris but, believing that she had no particular talent as a composer, she gave up writing music and became a teacher. In that capacity, she influenced generations of young composers, especially those from the United States and other English-speaking countries. Among her students were many important composers, soloists, arrangers, and conductors, including Grażyna Bacewicz, Daniel Barenboim, Lennox Berkeley, İdil Biret, Elliott Carter, Aaron Copland, David Diamond, John Eliot Gardiner, Philip Glass, Roy Harris, Quincy Jones, Gilbert Levine, Dinu Lipatti, Igor Markevitch, Julia Perry, Astor Piazzolla, Laurence Rosenthal, and .

Boulanger taught in the U.S. and England, working with music academies including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Longy School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, but her principal base for most of her life was her family&#x27;s flat in Paris, where she taught for most of the seven decades from the start of her career until her death at the age of 92.

Boulanger was the first woman to conduct many major orchestras in America and Europe, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Hallé, and Philadelphia orchestras. She conducted several world premieres, including works by Copland and Stravinsky.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Nadia Boulanger was born in Paris on 16 September 1887, to French composer and pianist Ernest Boulanger (1815–1900) and his wife Raissa Myshetskaya (1856–1935), a Russian princess, who descended from St. Mikhail Tchernigovsky.

Ernest Boulanger had studied at the Paris Conservatoire and, in 1835 at the age of 20, won the coveted Prix de Rome for composition. He wrote comic operas and incidental music for plays, but was most widely known for his choral music. He achieved distinction as a director of choral groups, teacher of voice, and a member of choral competition juries. After years of rejection, in 1872 he was appointed to the Paris Conservatoire as professor of singing.

Raissa qualified as a home tutor (or governess) in 1873. According to Ernest, he and Raissa met in Russia in 1873, and she followed him back to Paris. She joined his voice class at the Conservatoire in 1876, and they were married in Russia in 1877.
Ernest and Raissa had a daughter, Ernestine Mina Juliette, who died as an infant before Nadia was born on her father&#x27;s 72nd birthday.

Through her early years, although both parents were very active musically, Nadia would get upset by hearing music and hide until it stopped. In 1892, when Nadia was five, Raissa became pregnant again. During the pregnancy, Nadia&#x27;s response to music changed drastically. &quot;One day I heard a fire bell. Instead of crying out and hiding, I rushed to the piano and tried to reproduce the sounds. My parents were amazed.&quot; After this, Boulanger paid great attention to the singing lessons her father gave, and began to study the rudiments of music.

Her sister, named Marie-Juliette Olga but known as Lili Boulanger, was born in 1893, when Nadia was six. When Ernest brought Nadia home from their friends&#x27; house, before she was allowed to see her mother or Lili, he made her promise solemnly to be responsible for the new baby&#x27;s welfare. He urged her to take part in her sister&#x27;s care.

From the age of seven, Nadia studied in preparation for her Conservatoire entrance exams, sitting in on their classes and having private lessons with its teachers. Lili often stayed in the room for these lessons, sitting quietly and listening.

In 1896, the nine-year-old Nadia entered the Conservatoire. She studied there with Fauré and others. She came in third in the 1897 solfège competition, and subsequently worked to win first prize in 1898. She took private lessons from Louis Vierne and Alexandre Guilmant. During this period, she also received religious instruction to become an observant Catholic, taking her First Communion on 4 May 1899. The Catholic religion remained important to her for the rest of her life.

In 1900 her father Ernest died, and money became a problem for the family. Raissa had an extravagant lifestyle, and the royalties she received from performances of Ernest&#x27;s music were insufficient to live on permanently. Nadia continued to work hard at the Conservatoire to become a teacher and be able to contribute to her family&#x27;s support.

In 1903, Nadia won the Conservatoire&#x27;s first prize in harmony; she continued to study for years, although she had begun to earn money through organ and piano performances. She studied composition with Gabriel Fauré and, in the 1904 competitions, she came first in three categories: organ, &quot;accompagnement au piano&quot; and fugue (composition). At her &quot;accompagnement&quot; exam, Boulanger met Raoul Pugno, a renowned French pianist, organist and composer, who subsequently took an interest in her career.

In the autumn of 1904, Nadia began to teach from the family apartment, at 36 rue Ballu. In addition to the private lessons she held there, Boulanger started holding a Wednesday afternoon group class in analysis and sightsinging. She continued these almost to her death. This class was followed by her famous &quot;at homes&quot;, salons at which students could mingle with professional musicians and Boulanger&#x27;s other friends from the arts, such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Valéry, Fauré, and others.

===Professional life===

After leaving the Conservatoire in 1904 and before her sister&#x27;s untimely death in 1918, Boulanger was a keen composer, encouraged by both Pugno and Fauré. Caroline Potter, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, says of Boulanger&#x27;s music: &quot;Her musical language is often highly chromatic (though always tonally based), and Debussy&#x27;s influence is apparent.&quot; Her goal was to win the First Grand Prix de Rome as her father had done, and she worked tirelessly towards it in addition to her increasing teaching and performing commitments. She first submitted work for judging in 1906, but failed to make it past the first round. In 1907 she progressed to the final round but again did not win.

In late 1907 she was appointed to teach elementary piano and &quot;accompagnement au piano&quot; at the newly created Conservatoire Femina-Musica. She was also appointed as assistant to Henri Dallier, the professor of harmony at the Conservatoire.

In the 1908 Prix de Rome competition, Boulanger caused a stir by submitting an instrumental fugue rather than the required vocal fugue. The subject was taken up by the national and international newspapers, and was resolved only when the French Minister of Public Information decreed that Boulanger&#x27;s work be judged on its musical merit alone. She won the Second Grand Prix for her cantata, &quot;La Sirène&quot;.

In 1908, as well as performing piano duets in public concerts, Boulanger and Pugno collaborated on composing a song cycle, &quot;Les Heures claires&quot;, which was well-received enough to encourage them to continue working together. Still hoping for a Grand Prix de Rome, Boulanger entered the 1909 competition but failed to win a place in the final round. Later that year, her sister Lili, then sixteen, announced to the family her intention to become a composer and win the Prix de Rome herself.

In 1910, Annette Dieudonné became a student of Boulanger&#x27;s, continuing with her for the next fourteen years. When her studies ended, she began teaching Boulanger&#x27;s students the rudiments of music and solfège. She was Boulanger&#x27;s close friend and assistant for the rest of her life.

Boulanger attended the premiere of Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot; in Paris, with music by Stravinsky. She immediately recognised the young composer&#x27;s genius and began a lifelong friendship with him.

In April 1912, Nadia Boulanger made her debut as a conductor, leading the &quot;Société des Matinées Musicales&quot; orchestra. They performed her 1908 cantata &quot;La Sirène&quot;, two of her songs, and Pugno&#x27;s &quot;Concertstück&quot; for piano and orchestra. The composer played as soloist.

Lili Boulanger won the Prix de Rome composition prize in 1913, the first woman to do so.

With the advent of war in Europe in 1914, public programs were reduced, and Boulanger had to put her performing and conducting on hold. She continued to teach privately and to assist Dallier at the Conservatoire. Nadia was drawn into Lili&#x27;s expanding war work, and by the end of the year, the sisters had organised a sizable charity, the &quot;Comité Franco-Américain du Conservatoire National de Musique et de Déclamation.&quot; It supplied items such as food, clothing, money, and letters from home to soldiers who had been musicians before the war.

Weakened by her work during the war, Lili began to suffer ill health. She died in March 1918.

===Life after Lili&#x27;s death, 1918–21===

Nadia struggled with the death of her sister and according to Jeanice Brooks, &quot;[t]he dichotomy between private grief and public strength was strongly characteristic of Boulanger&#x27;s frame of mind in the immediate aftermath of World War I. Privately, Nadia kept a shrine of her sister in her home. This was likely influenced by the resurgence of spiritism, the interest in a person’s spiritual existence after death and communication with lost loved ones. It may have also been influenced by her involvement in Catholicism, which utilizes objects, figures, and rituals as mediators between the living and the dead. Guilt at surviving her talented sibling seems to have led to determination to deserve Lili&#x27;s death, which Nadia framed as redemptive sacrifice, by throwing herself into work and domestic responsibility: as Nadia wrote in her datebook in January 1919, &#x27;I place this new year before you, my little beloved Lili–may it see me fulfill my duty towards you–so that it is less terrible for Mother and that I try to resemble you.

In 1919, Boulanger performed in more than twenty concerts, often programming her own music and that of her sister. Since the Conservatoire Femina-Musica had closed during the war, Alfred Cortot and Auguste Mangeot founded a new music school in Paris, which opened later that year as the École normale de musique de Paris. Boulanger was invited by Cortot to join the school, where she taught classes in harmony, counterpoint, musical analysis, organ and composition.

Mangeot also asked Boulanger to contribute articles of music criticism to his paper &quot;Le Monde Musical&quot;, and she occasionally provided articles for this and other newspapers for the rest of her life, though she never felt at ease setting her opinions down for posterity in this way.

In 1920, Boulanger began to compose again, writing a series of songs to words by Camille Mauclair. In 1921, she performed at two concerts in support of women&#x27;s rights, both of which featured music by Lili. However later in life she claimed never to have been involved with feminism, and that women should not have the right to vote as they &quot;lacked the necessary political sophistication.&quot;

===American School at Fontainebleau, 1921–1935===
In the summer of 1921 the French Music School for Americans opened in Fontainebleau, with Boulanger listed on the programme as a professor of harmony. Her close friend Isidor Philipp headed the piano departments of both the Paris Conservatory and the new Fontainebleau School and was an important draw for American students. She inaugurated the custom, which would continue for the rest of her life, of inviting the best students to her summer residence at Gargenville one weekend for lunch and dinner. Among the students attending the first year at Fontainebleau was Aaron Copland.

Boulanger&#x27;s unrelenting schedule of teaching, performing, composing, and writing letters started to take its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches. She stopped writing as a critic for &quot;Le Monde musical&quot; as she could not attend the requisite concerts. To maintain her and her mother&#x27;s living standards, she concentrated on teaching which was her most lucrative source of income. Fauré believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told him, &quot;If there is one thing of which I am certain, it is that I wrote useless music.&quot;

In 1924, Walter Damrosch, Arthur Judson and the New York Symphony Society arranged for Boulanger to tour the USA. She set sail on the Cunard flagship on Christmas Eve. The ship arrived on New Year&#x27;s Eve in New York after an extremely rough crossing. During this tour, she performed solo organ works, pieces by Lili, and premiered Copland&#x27;s new &quot;Symphony for Organ and Orchestra&quot;, which he had written for her. She returned to France on 28 February 1925.

Later that year, Boulanger approached the publisher Schirmer to enquire if they would be interested in publishing her methods of teaching music to children. When nothing came of it, she abandoned trying to write about her ideas.

Gershwin visited Boulanger in 1927, asking for lessons in composition. They spoke for half an hour after which Boulanger announced, &quot;I can teach you nothing.&quot; Taking this as a compliment, Gershwin repeated the story many times.

The Great Depression increased social tensions in France. Days after the Stavisky riots in February 1934, and in the midst of a general strike, Boulanger resumed conducting. She made her Paris debut with the orchestra of the École normale in a programme of Mozart, Bach, and Jean Françaix. Boulanger&#x27;s private classes continued; Elliott Carter recalled that students who did not dare to cross Paris through the riots showed only that they did not &quot;take music seriously enough&quot;. By the end of the year, she was conducting the Orchestre Philharmonique de Paris in the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées with a programme of Bach, Monteverdi and Schütz.

Her mother Raissa died in March 1935, after a long decline. This freed Boulanger from some of her ties to Paris, which had prevented her from taking up teaching opportunities in the United States.

===Touring and recording===

In 1936, Boulanger substituted for Alfred Cortot in some of his piano masterclasses, coaching the students in Mozart&#x27;s keyboard works. Later in the year, she traveled to London to broadcast her lecture-recitals for the BBC, as well as to conduct works including Schütz, Fauré and Lennox Berkeley. Noted as the first woman to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she received acclaim for her performances.

Boulanger&#x27;s long-held passion for Monteverdi culminated in her recording six discs of madrigals for His Master&#x27;s Voice in 1937, which brought his music to a new, wider audience. Not all reviewers approved her use of modern instruments.

When Hindemith published his &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition&quot;, Boulanger asked him for permission to translate the text into French, and to add her own comments. Hindemith never responded to her offer. After he fled from Nazi Germany to the United States, they did not discuss the matter further.

Late in 1937, Boulanger returned to Britain to broadcast for the BBC and hold her popular lecture-recitals. In November, she became the first woman to conduct a complete concert of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London, which included Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; and Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Amor (Lamento della ninfa)&quot;. Describing her concerts, Mangeot wrote,
She never uses a dynamic level louder than mezzo-forte and she takes pleasure in veiled, murmuring sonorities, from which she nevertheless obtains great power of expression. She arranges her dynamic levels so as never to have need of fortissimo ...

In 1938, Boulanger returned to the US for a longer tour. She had arranged to give a series of lectures at Radcliffe, Harvard, Wellesley and the Longy School of Music, and to broadcast for NBC. During this tour, she became the first woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In her three months there, she gave over a hundred lecture-recitals, recitals and concerts These included the world premiere of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Dumbarton Oaks Concerto&quot;. At that time she was seen by American sculptor Katharine Lane Weems who recorded in her diary, &quot;Her voice is surprisingly deep. She is quite slim with an excellent figure and fine features, Her skin is delicate, her hair graying slightly, she wears pince-nez and gesticulates as she becomes excited talking about music.&quot;

His Master&#x27;s Voice issued two additional Boulanger records in 1938: the Piano Concerto in D by Jean Françaix, which she conducted; and the Brahms &quot;Liebeslieder Waltzes&quot;, in which she and Dinu Lipatti were the duo pianists with a vocal ensemble, and (again with Lipatti) a selection of the Brahms Waltzes, Op. 39 for piano four hands.

During Boulanger&#x27;s tour of America the following year, she became the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Washington National Symphony Orchestra. She gave 102 lectures in 118 days across the US.

===Second World War and emigration, 1940–45===
As the Second World War loomed, Boulanger helped her students leave France. She made plans to do so herself. Stravinsky joined her at Gargenville, where they awaited news of the German attack against France. Waiting to leave France till the last moment before the invasion and occupation, Boulanger arrived in New York via Madrid and Lisbon on 6 November 1940.
After her arrival, Boulanger traveled to the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to give classes in harmony, fugue, counterpoint and advanced composition. In 1942, she also began teaching at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Her classes included music history, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, orchestration and composition.

===Later life in Paris, 1946–79===
Leaving America at the end of 1945, she returned to France in January 1946. There she accepted a position of professor of &quot;accompagnement au piano&quot; at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1953, she was appointed overall director of the Fontainebleau School. She also continued her touring to other countries.

As a long-standing friend of the family, and as official chapel-master to the Prince of Monaco, Boulanger was asked to organise the music for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and the American actress Grace Kelly in 1956. In 1958, she returned to the US for a six-week tour. She combined broadcasting, lecturing, and making four television films.

Also in 1958, she was inducted as an Honorary Member into Sigma Alpha Iota, the international women&#x27;s music fraternity, by the Gamma Delta chapter at the Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York.

In 1962, she toured Turkey, where she conducted concerts with her young protégée İdil Biret. Later that year, she was invited to the White House of the United States by President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, and in 1966, she was invited to Moscow to jury for the International Tchaikovsky Competition, chaired by Emil Gilels. While in England, she taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School. She also gave lectures at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, all of which were broadcast by the BBC.

Her eyesight and hearing began to fade toward the end of her life. On 13 August 1977, in advance of her 90th birthday, she was given a surprise birthday celebration at Fontainebleau&#x27;s English Garden. The school&#x27;s chef had prepared a large cake, on which was inscribed: &quot;1887–Happy Birthday to you, Nadia Boulanger–Fontainebleau, 1977&quot;. When the cake was served, 90 small white candles floating on the pond illuminated the area. Boulanger&#x27;s then-protégé, Emile Naoumoff, performed a piece he had composed for the occasion. Boulanger worked almost until her death in 1979 in Paris. She is buried at the Montmartre Cemetery with her sister Lili and their parents.

==Pedagogy==

Asked about the difference between a well-made work and a masterpiece, Boulanger replied,
I can tell whether a piece is well-made or not, and I believe that there are conditions without which masterpieces cannot be achieved, but I also believe that what defines a masterpiece cannot be pinned down. I won&#x27;t say that the criterion for a masterpiece does not exist, but I don&#x27;t know what it is. She claimed to enjoy all &quot;good music&quot;. According to Lennox Berkeley, &quot;A good waltz has just as much value to her as a good fugue, and this is because she judges a work solely on its aesthetic content.&quot; &quot;She was an admirer of Debussy, and a disciple of Ravel. Although she bore little sympathy for Schoenberg and the Viennese dodecaphonicians, she was an ardent champion of Stravinsky.&quot;

She insisted on complete attention at all times: &quot;Anyone who acts without paying attention to what he is doing is wasting his life. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece.&quot;

In 1920, two of her favourite female students left her to marry. She thought they had betrayed their work with her and their obligation to music. Her attitude to women in music was contradictory: despite Lili&#x27;s success and her own eminence as a teacher, she held throughout her life that a woman&#x27;s duty was to be a wife and mother. According to Ned Rorem, she would &quot;always give the benefit of the doubt to her male students while overtaxing the females&quot;. She saw teaching as a pleasure, a privilege and a duty: &quot;No-one is obliged to give lessons. It poisons your life if you give lessons and it bores you.&quot;

Boulanger accepted pupils from any background; her only criterion was that they had to want to learn. She treated students differently depending on their ability: her talented students were expected to answer the most rigorous questions and perform well under stress. The less able students, who did not intend to follow a career in music, were treated more leniently, and Michel Legrand claimed that the ones she disliked were graduated with a first prize in one year: &quot;The good pupils never got a reward so they stayed. I was [there] for seven years. And I never obtained a first prize&quot;. Each student had to be approached differently: &quot;When you accept a new pupil, the first thing is to try to understand what natural gift, what intuitive talent he has. Each individual poses a particular problem.&quot; &quot;It does not matter what style you use, as long as you use it consistently.&quot; Boulanger used a variety of teaching methods, including traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight-singing (using fixed-Do solfège).

When she first looked at a student&#x27;s score, she often commented on its relation to the work of a variety of composers: for example, &quot;[T]hese measures have the same harmonic progressions as Bach&#x27;s F major prelude and Chopin&#x27;s F major Ballade. Can you not come up with something more interesting?&quot; Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: &quot;Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory.&quot; Copland recalled that &quot;she had but one all-embracing principle ... the creation of what she called &quot;la grande ligne&quot; – the long line in music.&quot; She disapproved of innovation for innovation&#x27;s sake: &quot;When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious.&quot; She said, &quot;You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself. It&#x27;s always necessary to be yourself – that is a mark of genius in itself.&quot; Quincy Jones says Boulanger told him &quot;Your music can never be more or less than you are as a human being&quot;.

She always claimed that she could not bestow creativity onto her students and that she could only help them to become intelligent musicians who understood the craft of composition. &quot;I can&#x27;t provide anyone with inventiveness, nor can I take it away; I can simply provide the liberty to read, to listen, to see, to understand.&quot; Only inspiration could make the difference between a well-made piece and an artistic one. She believed that the desire to learn, to become better, was all that was required to achieve – always provided the right amount of work was put in. She would quote the examples of Rameau (who wrote his first opera at fifty), Wojtowicz (who became a concert pianist at thirty-one), and Roussel (who had no professional access to music till he was twenty-five), as counter-arguments to the idea that great artists always develop out of gifted children.

Her memory was prodigious: by the time she was twelve, she knew the whole of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; by heart. Students have described her as knowing every significant piece, by every significant composer. Copland recalls,
Nadia Boulanger knew everything there was to know about music; she knew the oldest and the latest music, pre-Bach and post-Stravinsky. All technical know-how was at her fingertips: harmonic transposition, the figured bass, score reading, organ registration, instrumental techniques, structural analyses, the school fugue and the free fugue, the Greek modes and Gregorian chant.

Murray Perahia recalled being &quot;awed by the rhythm and character&quot; with which she played a line of a Bach fugue. Janet Craxton recalled listening to Boulanger&#x27;s playing Bach chorales on the piano as &quot;the single greatest musical experience of my life&quot;.

<doc id="466217" wikidata="Q7652932" url="?curid=466217" title="Swag (bedroll)">
<text>In Australia, a swag is a portable sleeping unit. It is normally a bundle of belongings rolled in a traditional fashion to be carried by a foot traveller in the bush. Before motor transport was common, foot travel over long distances was essential to agriculture in the Australian bush. It is sometimes referred to as a &quot;backpack bed&quot;.
Swags have been carried by shearers, miners, the unemployed, and many others, some of whom would have been happy to have been called swagmen and some not.

==History==
In the early 1800s, the term &quot;swag&quot; was used by British thieves to describe any amount of stolen goods. One definition given in Francis Grose&#x27;s 1811 &quot;Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; is &quot;any you have lately obtained... To carry the swag is to be the bearer of the stolen goods to a place of safety.&quot; James Hardy Vaux, a convict in Australia, used the term for similar purposes in his memoirs written in 1812 and published in 1819. By the 1830s, the term in Australia had transferred from meaning goods acquired by a thief to the possessions and daily necessaries carried by a bushman. The compound &quot;swagman&quot; and colloquial variation &quot;swaggie&quot; first appeared in the 1850s during the Australian gold rushes, alongside less common terms such as &quot;bundleman&quot;. New Zealanders adopted the term in the 1880s, where swagmen were also known as &quot;swaggers&quot;. &quot;Swagger&quot; also originated in Australia, but became obsolete there by the 1890s.

==Modern use==
In Australia, the term swag is widely used to refer to a portable shelter used for camping or outdoor sleeping that acts as tent, sleeping bag and mattress combined in a single item. Originally designed to be carried by bush travellers on foot, the modern swag has grown in both size and weight and is intended for campers travelling with a vehicle.

The modern swag is a waterproof canvas sleeping compartment that is sometimes insect-proof. Swags include a mattress (usually high density foam, 50 or 75mm thick). When rolled up the swag is relatively lightweight and compact, making it ideal for storage and transport. It is typically easy to erect, and roll up can be done quickly. Swags are still heavily used in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags. The modern swag is designed for robustness and is marketed towards those travelling by vehicle – they are too heavy (10-20kg) and bulky to be transported long distances on foot. Bushwalkers and hikers would use conventional lightweight tents and sleeping bags. More recently, several camping supply firms have produced readymade bedrolls along the pattern of the original swag.

2. a pack of personal belongings.
3. The Australian Swag, as defined in the past, is a portable sleeping unit. It is normally a bundle of belongings rolled in a traditional fashion to be carried by a foot traveler in the bush. Before motor transport was common, foot travel over long distances was essential to agriculture in the Australian bush.

<text>George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle (17 September 17737 October 1848), styled Viscount Morpeth until 1825, was a British statesman. He served as Lord Privy Seal between 1827 and 1828 and in 1834 and was a member of Lord Grey&#x27;s Whig government as Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834.

==Early life==
Carlisle was the eldest son of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle of Castle Howard, and his wife Lady Margaret Caroline Leveson-Gower, Among his siblings were brothers: Hon. William Howard, Maj. Hon. Frederick Howard, and the Very Rev. Hon. Henry Howard, Dean of Lichfield; and sisters: Lady Isabella Howard (wife of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor), Lady Elizabeth Howard (wife of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland), and Lady Gertrude Howard (wife of William Sloane-Stanley).

His paternal grandparents were Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle and, his second wife, Hon Isabella Byron (daughter of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and relative of Lord Byron). His mother was daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and his wife Lady Louisa, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater.

He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.

==Political career==
Carlisle was returned to parliament for Morpeth as a Whig in 1795, a seat he held until 1806; he then represented Cumberland until 1820. In 1806 he was sworn on to the Privy Council and appointed to the Indian board in the unity &quot;Ministry of All the Talents&quot;, but resigned in 1807. In 1825 he succeeded his father in the earldom and he entered the House of Lords.

He served in the moderate Tory governments of George Canning and Lord Goderich as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between May and July 1827 and as Lord Privy Seal (with a seat in the cabinet) between July 1827 and January 1828. However, he split with the Tories over electoral reform and later served as a member of the cabinet in the Whig administrations of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne as Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834 and once again as Lord Privy Seal between July and November 1834.

As his eldest son died unmarried and without legitimate issue, his third son became the 8th Earl of Carlisle in 1864. He also died unmarried and without legitimate issue, so the 9th Earl of Carlisle was his grandson, George James Howard, the only son of his fifth son Charles, whose descendants hold the titles to this day.

<text>The Autumn of the Patriarch (original Spanish title: &quot;El otoño del patriarca&quot;) is a 1975 novel by Gabriel García Márquez.

A &quot;poem on the solitude of power&quot; according to the author, the novel is a flowing tract on the life of an eternal dictator. The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypical Caribbean tyrant.

García Márquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life leaders, including Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of his Colombian homeland, Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain (the novel was written in Barcelona), François Duvalier of Haiti, and Venezuela&#x27;s Juan Vicente Gómez. The product is a universal story of the disastrous effects created by the concentration of power into a single man.

==Plot introduction==
The book is written in long paragraphs with extended sentences. The general&#x27;s thoughts are relayed to the reader through winding sentences which convey his desperation and loneliness alongside the atrocities and ruthless behavior that keep him in power. The first three chapters begin with an omniscient and anonymous narrator finding the corpse of the General; the beginning of the third chapter reveals that the body belonged to Patricio Aragonés, whom, due to their uncanny resemblance, the general uses to fake his own death. 

One of the book&#x27;s most striking aspects is its focus on the God-like status held by the protagonist and the unfathomable awe and respect with which his people regard him. Dictators and strongmen such as Khamenei, Franco, Somoza, and Trujillo managed to hold sway over the populations of their nations despite internal political division. García Márquez symbolizes this with the discovery of the dictator&#x27;s corpse in the presidential palace.

==Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science==

García Márquez mocks the practice of conferring high military rank on the young heirs of autocrats and the overspending of their families and cronies. A frighteningly accurate portrait is drawn of the intelligence director who soon directs the general&#x27;s every move and constructs an apparatus of terror and political repression.

This last portrait is one of the most compelling: &quot;advisors&quot; have often marked the corruption and descent into oppression of some of Latin America&#x27;s most outstanding dictatorships. Trujillo&#x27;s Dominican Republic carried out dozens of assassinations and terror campaigns against Dominican exiles under the direction of intelligence chief Johnny Abbes García.

==Popularity==
According to a research from the Spanish Book Institute, &quot;The Autumn of the Patriarch&quot; was the most popular book sold in Spain in 1975.

<doc id="466229" wikidata="Q7866456" url="?curid=466229" title="UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.">
<text>USL v. BSDi was a lawsuit brought in New Jersey federal court in 1992 by Unix System Laboratories against Berkeley Software Design, Inc and the Regents of the University of California over intellectual property related to the Unix operating system; a culmination of the Unix wars. The case was settled out of court in 1994 after the judge expressed doubt in the validity of USL&#x27;s intellectual property, with Novell (who by that time had bought USL) and the University agreeing not to litigate further over the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).

== Background ==
The suit has its roots at the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, which had a license for the source code of UNIX from AT&amp;T&#x27;s Bell Labs. Students doing operating systems research at the CSRG modified and extended UNIX, and the CSRG made several releases of the modified operating system beginning in 1978, with AT&amp;T&#x27;s blessing. Because this Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) contained copyrighted AT&amp;T Unix source code, it was only available to organizations with a source code license for Unix from AT&amp;T.

Students and faculty at the CSRG audited the software code for the TCP/IP stack, removing all the AT&amp;T intellectual property, and released it to the general public in 1988 as &quot;Net/1&quot;, under the BSD license. When it became apparent that the Berkeley CSRG would soon close, students and faculty at the CSRG began an effort to remove all the remaining AT&amp;T code from the BSD and replace it with their own. This effort resulted in the public release of Net/2 in 1991, again under the BSD license. Net/2 contained enough code for a nearly complete UNIX-like system, which the CSRG believed contained no AT&amp;T intellectual property.

Berkeley Software Design (BSDi) obtained the source for Net/2, filled in the missing pieces, and ported it to the Intel i386 computer architecture. BSDi then sold the resulting BSD/386 operating system, which could be ordered through 1-800-ITS-UNIX. This drew the ire of AT&amp;T, which did not agree with BSDi&#x27;s claim that BSD/386 was free of AT&amp;T intellectual property. AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System Laboratories subsidiary filed suit against BSDi in New Jersey in April 1992, a suit that was later amended to include The Regents of the University of California.

== USL&#x27;s complaint ==
In the lawsuit, USL alleged that:

* The Regents of the University of California, by releasing Net/2 &quot;based upon, substantially copied from, or derived from proprietary UNIX&quot;, had
** breached USL&#x27;s software license contract;
** infringed on USL&#x27;s copyright on UNIX;
** diluted USL&#x27;s trademark on UNIX;
** misappropriated USL&#x27;s trade secret on UNIX.

On these grounds, USL asked the court for a preliminary injunction that would bar BSDi from distributing the Net/2 software until the case was decided.

== Pretrial ==
At a hearing, BSDi contended that they were using the sources freely distributed by the University of California plus six additional files. BSDi accepted liability for their own six files, but refused to account for the other files distributed by the University of California. The judge agreed with BSDI&#x27;s argument and told USL to restate their complaint based solely on the six files or he would dismiss it. Rather than narrow down their claim, USL chose to sue BSDi and the University of California, and requested a preliminary injunction on the distribution of Net/2 from both.

In 1993, judge Dickinson R. Debevoise denied a preliminary injunction, on the grounds that USL had no valid copyright over 32V and could not show any obvious trade secret. Works published in the U.S. between January 1, 1978 and March 1, 1989, were subject to the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 405(a), which required the copyright owner to properly affix a copyright notice to the work in order to claim copyright protection. AT&amp;T released V32 in 1978, but omitted a notice from thousands of copies and failed to copyright 32V until 1992.

== University&#x27;s countersuit ==
In 1993, a few days after the dismissal of the preliminary injunction, the University filed a countersuit against USL in California, claiming that USL had failed to credit the University for the use of BSD code in System V, as required by the software license contract. The University demanded that USL be forced to reprint all their documentation with the appropriate due credit added, to notify all their licensees of their oversight, and to run full-page advertisements in major publications such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; informing the public of their omission.

== Settlement ==
In July 1993, soon after UC filed its countersuit, USL was purchased by Novell. Novell CEO Ray Noorda favored a settlement that was reached in February 1994. The salient points were:

* 4.4BSD-lite to be released containing no disputed files. University to encourage licensees to switch from Net/2.
* University to cease distribution of certain files.
* USL to grant three months&#x27; grace period to users of disputed files.
* Certain files distributed by University to carry USL copyright notice.
* Certain files distributed by USL to carry University copyright notices.
* USL to permit free distribution of certain files.
* University not to actively assist in legal attempts to challenge USL&#x27;s rights to certain files.

Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices. A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the upcoming 4.4BSD-Lite release.

<text>The Rhine–Main–Danube Canal (German: &quot;Rhein-Main-Donau-Kanal&quot;; also called Main-Danube Canal, RMD Canal or Europa Canal), is a canal in Bavaria, Germany. Connecting the Main and the Danube rivers across the European Watershed, it runs from Bamberg via Nuremberg to Kelheim. The canal connects the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, providing a navigable artery between the Rhine delta (at Rotterdam in the Netherlands), and the Danube Delta in south-eastern Romania and south-western Ukraine (or Constanța, through the Danube–Black Sea Canal). The present canal was completed in 1992 and is long.

== Early history ==
Projects for connecting the Danube and Rhine basins by canal have a long history. In 793, the Emperor Charlemagne ordered the construction of a canal—the &quot;Fossa Carolina&quot; (German: &quot;Karlsgraben&quot;)—connecting the Swabian Rezat, a tributary of the Rednitz, to the Altmühl near Treuchtlingen. Between 1836 and 1846 the Ludwig Canal (German: Ludwigskanal), named for King Ludwig I of Bavaria, was built between Bamberg and Kelheim. This canal had a narrow channel, with many locks, and a shortage of water in the peak section, so the operation of the waterway soon became uneconomic—especially given the rapidly advancing construction of the railway network in the southern German countryside. The canal finally was abandoned in 1950, after a decision was made to not repair damage it had suffered from Allied bombing during World War II.

In 1917, the Landtag of Bavaria passed a law calling for the development of a major shipping route &quot;between Aschaffenburg and Passau&quot;, with the capacity to carry the 1,200-ton ships used on the Rhine. On 13 June 1921, Bavaria and the German Reich concluded an agreement to build the &quot;Main-Donau-Wasserstraße&quot;.
Under this plan, in addition to the expansion of the Main and Danube, a completely new channel linking the rivers was to be created. The Rhein-Main-Donau AG (RMD-AG) was founded on 30 December 1921 to undertake the project. To finance the waterway, the RMD was given control of the water resources of the Main, Danube, Lech, Altmühl, and Regnitz.

== Construction ==
The first concrete plans for the new waterway emerged in 1938, for the so-called Mindorfer Linie south of Nuremberg. As early as 1939 the first preparatory work began at Thalmässing in Landkreis Roth. However, after the war this route was dropped. By 1962, the Main&#x27;s channel had been expanded as far upstream as Bamberg. In 1966, the Duisburger Vertrag, an agreement between Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany, was reached for financing the completion of the project. The contract was signed on 16 September of that year in Duisburg by Federal Transport Minister Hans-Christoph Seebohm, Federal Finance Minister Rolf Dahlgrün, Bavarian Prime Minister Alfons Goppel and the Bavarian Finance Minister Konrad Pöhner.
The last section to be built, between Nuremberg and Kelheim, became politically controversial in the 1970s and 1980s, mainly because of the long section through the Altmühl valley. On 25 September 1992, the canal was completed. The equivalent of some 2.3 billion euros were invested in the construction from 1960 to 1992. Almost 20 percent of that went for environmental protection projects.

== Route ==
From Bamberg to Fürth the canal follows the valley of the Regnitz, a tributary of the Main. From Fürth to beyond Roth it follows the valley of the Rednitz, a tributary of the Regnitz. It crosses the Franconian Jura mountains and joins the river Altmühl near Dietfurt. From Dietfurt to Kelheim on the Danube the canal follows the Altmühl valley.

===The remnants of the Ludwig Canal===
Today, some 60 kilometers of the Ludwig Canal still exists in good condition between Nuremberg and Berching. Some of the locks still function, and part of the towpath has been converted to a cycle track. The old canal comes close to the new canal at Pollanten, and from there the two canals flow downstream in parallel, eventually meeting 5km south of Berching.

==Dimensions ==

The cross-section of the waterway is normally trapezoidal, with width at the bottom, width at the water surface, of water depth, and a side grade of 1:3. The channel is a Waterway Class Vb; the largest authorised vessel is long and wide. The channel in the Kelheim-bound Bamberg lock has a depth of . In the few sections with a rectangular profile, the width is usually (i.e., the mean between top and bottom widths).

The length of the canal is ; the summit elevation (between the Hilpoltstein and Bachhausen locks) is above sea level. This is the highest point on Earth that is currently reached by commercial watercraft from the sea.

The height difference along the north ramp of the canal—from the Main at Bamberg to the crest elevation—is , with 11 locks. From the crest elevation down to the Altmühl at Dietfurt is a drop of through three locks. The further difference in elevation of along the Altmühl, with two more locks, makes a total of for the south ramp. This means that the Danube end of the canal is above the level of the Main end.

==Locks==
Along the course of the canal there are 16 locks with lifting heights of up to 25 meters (). The 16 locks are managed from four remote control centres (Neuses since 2007, Kriegenbrunn, Hilpoltstein, and Dietfurt from the beginning of 2007). These centres are staffed with one worker on the night shift, and two on the day shift. The locks were modernized from 2001 to 2007, replacing the outdated relay technology with programmable logic controllers (PLC). The cost was approximately $1.3 million per lock.

The summit pound is maintained by pumping water from the canal stretches below; and some water is drained into the summit pound from local natural sources. Finally a pumped storage artificial lake &quot;Dürrlohsee&quot; that sits even higher in elevation than the summit pound makes up the difference if the aforementioned sources of water are not sufficient.
Thirteen locks are designed to conserve water, which they do by piping first the top third, and then the middle third of the lock water into side tanks during the down cycle. On the up cycle, these tanks replenish first the bottom third and then the middle third of the lock volume. The remaining top third is supplied by water from the upper level of the canal.
== Commercial operation ==
There were different forecasts of freight transport volumes, from which benefit–cost ratio could be derived. In 1981, a Federal Minister for Transport cost–benefit account assumed an estimated traffic volume of only 2.7 million tonnes per year for the Main-Danube Canal, and a benefit–cost ratio of 0.52:1. This might have justified the termination of the project. One of the proponents commissioned a study by the Ifo-Institut München, predicting an estimated 5.5 million tonnes per year for the traffic volume on the Main-Danube Canal. In 2004, the freight volume in exchange traffic totalled 5.9 million tonnes and the total transport 6.9 million tonnes.

The course of the planned extension of the Danube waterway between Passau and Kelheim is still controversial. Proponents argue that the cost structure of inland navigation will require larger ship sizes, so that larger lock dimensions, deeper channels and secure minimum water depth will be required. Opponents argue the environmental degradation is too great and that inland navigation is falling.

== Transport volumes==

=== Transport volumes for 2006 ===
The transport volume through the RMD Canal in 2006 was down almost 20% compared to the previous year.
* Total 6.24 million tonnes (2005: 7.598 million tonnes)
* Number of vessels 5,280 (6,467), of which 2,823 travelled in the direction of the Danube and 2,457 toward the Rhine
* The channel was closed due to ice at Nuremberg for 25 days for traffic in the direction of the Main, and for 37 days in the direction of the Danube.

The most important goods, which were transported on the canal toward the Danube:
* Food and feed: 836,186 tonnes
* Ores and scrap: 795,259 tonnes
* Iron, steel, non-ferrous metals: 103,547 tonnes
* Stones, soil, building rubble: 510,187 tonnes
* Fertilizers: 296,340 tonnes

Goods transported toward the Rhine
* Food and feed: 476,422 tonnes
* Iron, steel, non-ferrous metals: 419,459 tonnes
* Fertilizers: 295,701 tonnes.

The container traffic declined from 3,986 to 2,539 TEUs. Of these 85% were in the direction of Danube.

Meanwhile, tourism along the canal is economically important. This has contributed to the extensive creation of habitats to compensate for the canal.

=== Transport volumes 2010 ===
The transport volume in traffic between Main-Danube Canal and Danube (Kelheim lock) in 2010 consisted of the following items (in tons):
Freight volume by country between Main-Donau-Kanal and Donau (Kelheim Lock) in 2010:

== Impact on ecology ==

The construction of canals involves ecological dangers. The Main-Danube Canal makes it possible for aquatic animals to spread from Western to Eastern Europe and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Invasive species often cause adverse impacts in the ecosystem of new habitats: competition with native species, lack of natural predators, introduction of diseases and parasites, etc. However, there is also the possibility that they will naturalize into the new ecosystem and their introduction lead to an enrichment of the resident wildlife.

In order to maintain navigable water levels for the waterway in the Main, Regnitz and Rednitz valleys, water must be diverted via the Altmühlüberleiter canal &amp; tunnel from the upper Altmühl to the Brombachsee reservoirs, across the European Watershed between the drainage basins of the Danube and Rhine.

On the other hand, the canal carries cargo traffic that would otherwise require 250,000 truck trips annually, or as an alternative, 3,000 freight trains on the Deutsche Bahn rail network.

=== Invasive animal species, east to west ===
So far about 20 species of invertebrates and a number of fish have spread from the Danube to the Main, and on to the Rhine and Lake Constance. The following list shows some examples:
* Fish
** Topmouth gudgeon (&quot;Pseudorasbora parva&quot;)
** Zarte (&quot;Vimba vimba&quot;)
** White-eye bream (&quot;Abramis sapa&quot;)
** Western tubenose goby (&quot;Proterorhinus semilunaris&quot;)
** Asp (&quot;Aspius aspius&quot;)
* Amphipods
** &quot;Dikerogammarus villosus&quot;
** &quot;Corophium curvispinum&quot;

=== Invasive animal species, west to east ===
This exchange also works in the opposite direction. Examples include:
* Asian clam (&quot;Corbicula fluminea&quot;)
* the freshwater shrimp (&quot;Atyaephyra desmaresti&quot;).
* the Chinese mitten crab (&quot;Eriocheir sinensis&quot;) (was found in the Austrian Danube in November 2002 for the first time).

== 1979 damburst at Katzwang ==

The construction work was interrupted on 26 March 1979 by a serious accident in the Nuremberg district of Katzwang. A dam broke on the Eibach–Schwanstetten section, which was still under construction but already flooded. About of water poured through the wide hole and flooded large parts of old Katzwang.

The force of the water was so great that it dug a wide crater and swept away cars, people and houses. During the rescue operations, a 12-year-old girl died. The damage was around DM 24 million (converted c. 12 million euros).

After the disaster, the entire canal line was checked for weaknesses and retrofitted at critical points.
== Triathlon ==
The long-distance Challenge Roth triathlon, which is held annually in July, includes a swim in the Main-Danube Canal at Hilpoltstein. The canal is closed to vessel traffic during the race. An approximately -long section of the marathon route runs along the canal from the Hilpoltstein lock to the Leerstetten lock.

<text>Barentsburg () is the second-largest settlement in Svalbard, Norway, with about 455 inhabitants (). A coal mining town, the settlement was almost entirely made up of Russian and Ukrainian nationals. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, most of the Ukrainian citizens were reported to have left.

==History==
Rijpsburg, a now abandoned Dutch settlement on Spitsbergen on Cape Boheman (Bohemanflya), at the north site of Nordfjorden in the Isfjord, stood roughly diagonally opposite Longyearbyen. The Rotterdam-based Van der Eb and Dresselhuys Scheepvaartmaatschappij (navigation company) built it in 1920, using prefabricated huts, for the mining of coal. Twelve Dutch staff and 52 German miners started mining coal here that year.

The Dutch Spitsbergen Company, founded in 1920, bought a mine in Green Harbour from the Russians and mined coal from 1921 to 1926. The company renamed its settlement Barentsburg after the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz. In 1932 the company sold the mine, including its settlement Barentsburg, to the Soviet trust Arktikugol.

===2006 fire===
On October 17, 2006, Norwegian inspectors detected a smouldering underground fire in Barentsburg, prompting fears that an open fire might break out, which would have forced the total evacuation of Barentsburg for an indefinite period of time, and would also have caused environmental problems of unknown magnitude for the entire archipelago. The fire was later contained. Coal mining resumed at the end of 2010.

==Status==

Under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty of 1920, citizens of signatory countries have equal rights to exploit natural resources, and as a result Russia, along with Norway (via the Sveagruva mine and Mine 7), maintains mining operations on Svalbard. However, as Svalbard is under Norwegian sovereignty, the Russian government is represented in Barentsburg by a consulate.

Consequently, the town has a Norwegian postcode, 9178. Similarly, it uses Norwegian telephone numbering.

In 2022, Russia announced new investment plans to support its presence in Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Then, in 2023, amid continuing tensions around Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, the Russian Consulate General and Arktikugol staged a May 9 Day &quot;victory parade&quot; through Barentsburg consisting of 50 cars, snowmobiles, trucks and buses and also including a low-flying Mi-8 helicopter. While the Governor of Svalbard, Lars Fause, was reportedly invited to attend, he declined.

==Economy==
Barentsburg started as a Dutch mining town in the 1920s. In 1932 the Dutch sold their concession to the Soviet Union. Since 1932 the Russian state-owned Arktikugol (Russian for &quot;arctic coal&quot;) trust has been operating on Svalbard and the main economic activity in Barentsburg is coal mining by Arktikugol. The coal is usually exported to Northern European buyers. The town relies entirely on mainland Russia for food and coinage. There have been instances in which not enough food was sent, and aid packages were sent from Longyearbyen. Tourism is now being developed, but does not yet generate enough income to revive the town.

Prior to 2022, the majority of workers and inhabitants were Russians and Ukrainians. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the economy of Barentsburg has been in steady decline, and population, which once numbered around a thousand, has decreased drastically.

Amid the warming waters, Russia has said it intends to build a facility in Barentsburg to process fish for export.

==Transportation==
The distance from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg is about but there are no roads connecting the two settlements. Most contact between the two is by boat, snowmobile, or helicopter. There is a heliport (ICAO code ENBA) with a road connection at Heerodden (), north of Barentsburg. The port is located in the middle of Barentsburg. Tourists usually arrive via a 2-3-hour boat trip from Longyearbyen. The coal is freighted by ship.

==Climate==
Barentsburg features a tundra climate (&quot;ETs&quot; under the Köppen climate classification), with short, dry, chilly summers and long, very cold, snowy winters, though winters there are noticeably warmer than winters in a number of locations with tundra climates. Because the town is located at a latitude approaching 80 degrees, only four months of the year have average temperatures above freezing, and in no month does the average monthly temperature exceed , meaning it is north of the tree line. Average low temperatures during the winter routinely drop below . Barentsburg averages roughly of precipitation, much of which falls as snow. The town typically experiences snowfall in every month of the year. 
==Science and culture==

The Barentsburg Pomor Museum presents Pomor culture, Arctic flora and fauna, and archaeological objects preserved in the permafrost. It is open when the daily, summer-only boat from Longyearbyen arrives, and by special arrangement. There is an athletic complex, including a swimming pool with heated seawater.

Every summer, several dozen geophysicists, geologists, archaeologists, biologists, glaciologists, geographers, etc., from Russia and elsewhere work in the scientific research centre. There is also a year-round meteorological observatory and the northernmost cosmic rays station.

==Education==

Barentsburg has its own school serving the Russian community; in 2014 it had three teachers, with one for most subjects, one for music, and one for the English language. By 2014, its welfare funds had declined.

<text>Stephen Lawrence Schwartz (born March 6, 1948) is an American musical theatre composer and lyricist. In a career spanning over five decades, Schwartz has written hit musicals such as &quot;Godspell&quot; (1971), &quot;Pippin&quot; (1972), and &quot;Wicked&quot; (2003). He has contributed lyrics to a number of successful films, including &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998, music and lyrics), &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), and &quot;Disenchanted&quot; (2022).

Schwartz has earned numerous accolades including three Grammy Awards, three Academy Awards, and a Golden Globe Award. He has received nominations for six Tony Awards, and a Laurence Olivier Award. He received the Tony Award&#x27;s Isabelle Stevenson Award in 2015.

==Early life and education==
Schwartz is Jewish, and was born in New York City, the son of Sheila Lorna (née Siegel), a teacher, and Stanley Leonard Schwartz, a businessman. He grew up in the Williston Park area of Nassau County, New York, where he graduated from Mineola High School in 1964. While attending Carnegie Mellon University, Schwartz composed and directed an early version of &quot;Pippin&quot; (entitled &quot;Pippin, Pippin&quot;) with the student-run theatre group, Scotch&#x27;n&#x27;Soda. Schwartz graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1968 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in drama.

==Career==
===Early career===
Upon returning to New York City, Schwartz went to work as a producer for RCA Records, but shortly thereafter began to work in Broadway theatre. He was asked to be the musical director of the first American rock opera, &quot;The Survival of St. Joan&quot;. He was credited as the producer of the double album of the soundtrack with the progressive rock group Smoke Rise on Paramount Records. His first major credit was the title song for the play &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot;; the song was eventually used in the movie version as well.

In 1971, he wrote music and lyrics for &quot;Godspell&quot;, for which he won several awards, including two Grammys. For this musical&#x27;s Toronto production in 1972, he asked Paul Shaffer to be the musical director, thus starting Shaffer&#x27;s career. &quot;Godspell&quot; was followed by the English-language texts, in collaboration with Leonard Bernstein, for Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot;, which opened the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. In 1972, the long-running &quot;Pippin&quot; premiered on Broadway. Schwartz had begun writing songs for &quot;Pippin&quot; while in college, although none of the songs from the college version ended up in the Broadway production. Both &quot;Pippin&quot; and &quot;Godspell&quot; continue to be frequently produced.

Two years after &quot;Pippin&quot; debuted, Schwartz wrote music and lyrics of &quot;The Magic Show&quot;, which ran for just under 2,000 performances. By mid-1974, at age 26, Schwartz had three smash hit musicals playing in New York simultaneously. Next were the music and lyrics of &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which closed before reaching Broadway after an out-of-town tryout tour in 1976. However, the cast album went on to attain cult status, which led to several subsequent productions, including a London production directed by Trevor Nunn in 1990 and another at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey in 2005.

In 1978, Schwartz&#x27;s next Broadway project was a musical version of Studs Terkel&#x27;s &quot;Working&quot;, which he adapted and directed, winning the Drama Desk Award as best director, and for which he contributed four songs. He also co-directed the television production, which was presented as part of the PBS &quot;American Playhouse&quot; series. In 1977, Schwartz wrote a children&#x27;s book called &quot;The Perfect Peach&quot;. In the 1980s, Schwartz wrote songs for a one-act musical for children, &quot;The Trip&quot;, which 20 years later was revised, expanded and produced as &quot;Captain Louie&quot;. He then wrote music for three of the songs of the Off-Broadway revue &quot;Personals&quot;, and lyrics to Charles Strouse&#x27;s music for the musical &quot;Rags&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1991, Schwartz wrote the music and lyrics for the musical &quot;Children of Eden&quot;. He then began working in film, collaborating with composer Alan Menken on the scores for the Disney animated features &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), for which he received two Academy Awards, and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996). He provided songs for DreamWorks&#x27; first musical animated feature, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), winning another Academy Award for the song &quot;When You Believe&quot;. He wrote music and lyrics for the original television musical, &quot;Geppetto&quot; (2000), seen on &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;. A stage adaptation of this piece premiered in June 2006 at The Coterie Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri, and was titled &quot;Geppetto and Son&quot;, and is now known as &quot;Disney&#x27;s My Son Pinocchio: Geppetto&#x27;s Musical Tale&quot;. A version created for young performers, titled &quot;Geppetto &amp; Son, Jr.&quot; had its world premiere on July 17, 2009, at the Lyric Theatre in Stuart, Florida. It was presented by the StarStruck Performing Arts Center.

In 2003, Schwartz returned to Broadway, as composer and lyricist for &quot;Wicked&quot;, a musical based on the novel &quot;&quot;, which tells the story of the &quot;Oz&quot; characters from the point of view of the witches. Schwartz won a Grammy Award for his work as composer and lyricist and producer of &quot;Wicked&quot;&#x27;s cast recording. On March 23, 2006, the Broadway production of &quot;Wicked&quot; passed the 1,000 performance mark, making Schwartz one of four composers (the other three being Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jerry Herman, and Richard Rodgers) to have three shows last that long on Broadway (the other two were &quot;Pippin&quot; and &quot;The Magic Show&quot;). In 2007, Schwartz joined Jerry Herman as being one of only two composer/lyricists to have three shows run longer than 1,500 performances on Broadway.

After &quot;Wicked&quot;, Schwartz contributed music and lyrics for a new musical that was commissioned to celebrate the bicentennial of the birth of Hans Christian Andersen. The production, titled &quot;Mit Eventyr&quot; or &quot;My Fairytale&quot;, opened at the Gladsaxe Theatre in Copenhagen in the fall of 2005. The American premiere of &quot;My Fairytale&quot; took place in the summer of 2011 at the PCPA Theatrefest of California and was directed by the composer&#x27;s son Scott Schwartz.

Schwartz returned to Hollywood in 2007 and wrote lyrics for the hit Disney film &quot;Enchanted&quot;, again collaborating with Menken. Three songs from the film, &quot;Happy Working Song&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s How You Know&quot;, and &quot;So Close&quot;, were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. He has written the theme song for the Playhouse Disney show &quot;Johnny and the Sprites&quot;, starring John Tartaglia. A recent project is incidental music for his son Scott Schwartz&#x27;s adaptation of Willa Cather&#x27;s &quot;My Ántonia&quot;.

On several occasions prior to 2008, Schwartz had reached out to Tim Dang who was the longtime artistic director of Los Angeles-based Asian-Pacific Islander theater company, East West Players (EWP). This collaboration led to the conception of a new version of &quot;Pippin&quot;, aesthetically inspired by Japanese anime and musically inspired by hip-hop. The production was a record-breaking hit and remained the highest grossing production in EWP&#x27;s history for an entire decade before being dethroned by &quot;Allegiance&quot; in 2018.

In 2008, Applause Theatre and Cinema Books published the first ever Schwartz biography titled &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, by Carol de Giere. The book is a comprehensive look at his career and life, and includes sections on how to write for the musical theatre.

Turning to the pop world in 2009, Schwartz collaborated with John Ondrasik in writing two songs on the Five for Fighting album &quot;Slice&quot;, the title track as well as &quot;Above the Timberline&quot;. Ondrasik became familiar with Schwartz based on his daughter&#x27;s affection for, and repeated attendance at performances of, the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;.

In September 2011, Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois premiered Schwartz&#x27;s new musical, &quot;Snapshots&quot;, which featured music and lyrics by Schwartz, book by David Stern, and was directed by Ken Sawyer. It blended together &quot;some of the best-loved music with some of the genuinely wonderful lesser known gems of (the) renowned Broadway composer.&quot;

On March 22, 2012, the San Francisco Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus released &quot;Testimony&quot;, composed by Schwartz with lyrics taken from submissions to Dan Savage&#x27;s It Gets Better Project.

In March 2015, Princess Cruises announced a partnership with Schwartz for the development of four shows over three years. The first will be a magic themed revue of Schwartz&#x27;s music, titled &quot;Magic To Do&quot;, including one new song written for the show.

Schwartz returned to write the lyrics for a sequel to &quot;Enchanted&quot;, titled &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, and will do the same for a live-action remake of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame.&quot;

In April 2020 Schwartz participated in a fund-raising video called Saturday Night Seder which featured an &quot;all-star&quot; cast of performers, composers and religious leaders broadcasting from their home computers and cellphones due to the practice of &quot;social distancing&quot; used by people around the world in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic. The video explained the story of Passover through stories, song, comedy and memories, and raised money for the CDC Foundation.

==Personal life==
Schwartz married Carole Piasecki on June 6, 1969. They have two children, Jessica and Scott. Although he has not publicly commented on his orientation, as of 2024, Schwartz is in a long-term relationship with Broadway actor and frequent collaborator Michael McCorry Rose. Both Schwartz and Rose have appeared at public events, and Schwartz is also referred to as a &#x27;long-term partner&#x27; on Michael McRorry Rose&#x27;s official website. 

In 2009 Schwartz was elected president of the Dramatists Guild of America, succeeding John Weidman; he stepped down in 2014, to be succeeded by Doug Wright.

<doc id="466260" wikidata="Q1419750" url="?curid=466260" title="IRC operator">
<text>An IRC operator (often abbreviated as IRCop or oper) is a user on an Internet Relay Chat network who has privileged access. IRC operators are charged with the task of enforcing the network&#x27;s rules, and in many cases, improving the network in various areas. The permissions available to an IRC operator vary according to the server software in use, and the server&#x27;s configuration.

IRC operators are divided into local and global operators. The former are limited to the server(s) they have specific access to; however, global operators can perform actions affecting all users on the network. In order to perform their duties, IRC operators usually have the ability to:
* Forcibly disconnect users (Kill)
* Ban (K-line or G-line) users
* Change network routing by disconnecting (squitting) or connecting servers

Traditionally, a list of operators on a particular server is available in the MOTD, or through the command. A user can become an operator by sending the command /oper to the irc server they currently are on using a pre-selected username and a password as parameters. The command only works for the server which has the proper O-line in its IRCd configuration file. The IP address that the user is operating from may also have to match a predefined one, as an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized users operating if they have cracked the operator&#x27;s password.

== Operator types ==
In many IRC networks, IRCops have different types of access on a network. These ranks often depend upon the IRCd software used, though a few specific access levels remain fairly constant throughout variations:

=== Local operator ===
The Local operator (LocOp) is the lowest in operator access levels. The LocOp has a minimal control on one server out of a network, and usually has the ability to kill (disconnect) people from the server or perform local K-lines (server ban).

=== Global operator ===
The Global Operator (GlobOp) is similar to the LocOp, and has control over the entire network of servers, as opposed to a single server. GlobOps may perform G-lines or AKills (network-wide bans) and shun (forcibly mute) users over an entire network.

=== Services administrator ===
Commonly abbreviated as SA, This admin type has control over all functionality on an IRC network available via network service bots, including the commonly used NickServ, ChanServ, and MemoServ nicks. Usually, an SA has the ability to use the /sa* commands. The /sa* commands, like all actions performed by network services, are typically implemented using a virtual services node on the network, effectively masking the origin of the actions.

=== Network administrator ===
The Network administrator (NetAdmin) has the highest level of access on a network. In most cases, the founder of the network is the netadmin. Networks may, however, have multiple netadmins - especially networks with large populations.

<doc id="466266" wikidata="Q3414549" url="?curid=466266" title="Quinnipiac River">
<text>The Quinnipiac River ( ) is a long river in the New England region of the United States, located entirely in the state of Connecticut.

The river rises in West Central Connecticut from Dead Wood Swamp near the city of New Britain. It flows roughly southward to Plainville, Southington, and Cheshire, west of the city of Meriden, through Wallingford and Yalesville, North Haven, and flows into New Haven Harbor, an inlet of Long Island Sound, east of downtown New Haven.

== History ==

The name &quot;Quinnipiac&quot; comes from an Algonquian phrase meaning &quot;long water land&quot;, and historically referred both to the river and the area around its mouth at Long Island Sound. Europeans found the river in 1614. By the early 18th century, early settlers called the Quinnipiac River the Dragon River after the seals, then referred to as “sea dragons,” that were once abundant there. Although these seals were likely harbor seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;), archaeological evidence confirms that gray seals (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;), which are over twice the size of a harbor seal, also lived near the mouth of the Quinnipiac River as recently as the sixteenth century.

== Watershed and course ==
The Quinnipiac River watershed drains an area of approximately . There are four dams, most of which are old remnants, that impede boat travel. The first dam is about 1/2 mile south of Plantsville, the second dam is at the southeast corner of Hanover Pond in South Meriden, the third dam is in northeast Yalesville, and the fourth dam is at the south end of Community Lake in Wallingford.

In April 2017, a small hydroelectric plant using a screw turbine was installed at Hanover Pond.

Paddling is a frequent recreational activity along the Quinnipiac River, especially within the tidal marsh in North Haven. Additionally, the tidal variation extends approximately upriver from its mouth.

== Ecology and conservation ==
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the river suffered from severe pollution problems because of the presence of heavy industry and population centers in its watershed. The Quinnipiac was the subject of the first ever pollution control measure in the state of Connecticut. In 1886, the state legislature passed a measure prohibiting the City of Meriden from discharging raw sewage into the river. In 1891, the act resulted in the building of state&#x27;s second sewage treatment plant.

Nevertheless, by 1914, the State Board of Health reported that the major fish life had largely disappeared from its mouth. The pollution has been somewhat abated by the passage of the Connecticut Clean Water Act of 1967, and by the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which provided the legal authority to take measures to clean up the river&#x27;s watershed. The measures included the construction of advanced waste management facilities for sewage and industrial waste. Levels of copper in the river have decreased 70% since the 1980s and are now comparable to other reference streams in Connecticut. Combined sewer overflows from the City of New Haven are still regarded as a major problem for the estuary.

== Recreation ==
Paralleling the west bank of the Quinnipiac River through the entire length of Quinnipiac River State Park in North Haven is the Quinnipiac Trail.

<doc id="466275" wikidata="Q371782" url="?curid=466275" title="Alison Krauss">
<text>Alison Maria Krauss (born July 23, 1971) is an American bluegrass-country singer, fiddler and music producer. She entered the music industry at an early age, competing in local contests by the age of eight and recording for the first time at 14. She signed with Rounder Records in 1985 and released her first solo album in 1987. She was invited to join Union Station, releasing her first album with them as a group in 1989 and performing with them ever since.

Krauss has released 14 albums, appeared on numerous soundtracks, and sparked a renewed interest in bluegrass music in the United States. Her soundtrack performances have led to further popularity, including the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; soundtrack, and the &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; soundtrack, which led to her performance at the 2004 Academy Awards. Platinum-selling &quot;Raising Sand&quot; (2007) was the first of her two collaborations with English rock singer Robert Plant.

As of 2019, she has won 27 Grammy Awards from 42 nominations, ranking her fourth behind Beyoncé, Quincy Jones and classical conductor Georg Solti for most Grammy Award wins overall. Krauss was the singer and female artist with the most awards in Grammy history until Beyoncé won her 28th Grammy in 2021. When Krauss won her first Grammy in 1991, she was the second-youngest winner at that time.

On November 21, 2019, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. She was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in September 2021.

==Early life==
Alison Maria Krauss was born in Decatur, Illinois, to Fred and Louise Krauss. 

Fred Krauss was a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1952 at age 12, and taught his native language while he earned a doctorate in psychology. He later went into the business of real estate; among the properties he owned was the so-called American Football House, located at 704 W. High St. in Urbana, which was featured on the cover of the first album by emo band American Football. Louise Krauss, an American of German and Italian descent, is the daughter of artists, and works as an illustrator of magazines and textbooks. Fred and Louise met while they were studying at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. 

After a brief residence in nearby Decatur where Alison was born, the family settled in Champaign, where she was raised with her older brother, Viktor.

Krauss&#x27;s mother played banjo and acoustic guitar, so Krauss was exposed to folk music at home, and she heard rock and pop music on the radio: She liked Gary Numan&#x27;s synth-pop song &quot;Cars&quot;, and rock bands such as Foreigner, Bad Company, and Electric Light Orchestra. Her brother Viktor played piano and double bass in high school, launching a career as a jazz and rock multi-instrumentalist. At her mother&#x27;s insistence, Krauss began studying classical violin at age five. Krauss was reluctant to spend time practicing, but she continued with classical lessons until she was eleven. Krauss said her mother &quot;tried to find interesting things for me to do&quot; and &quot;wanted to get me involved in music, in addition to art and sports&quot;. Krauss was also very active in roller skating, and in her teens she finally decided on a career in music rather than roller derby.

In mid-1979, Krauss&#x27;s mother saw a notice for an upcoming fiddle competition at the Champaign County Fair, so she bought a bluegrass fiddle instruction book and the 1977 bluegrass album &quot;Duets&quot; by violinist Richard Greene. Krauss learned by ear to play several songs from the album, including &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;, which she practiced on violin with her mother accompanying on guitar. Krauss entered the talent contest in the novice category at the age of eight, placing fourth. (This is where she first met fiddler Andrea Zonn, who won the junior division at age 10.) Krauss investigated the bluegrass genre more thoroughly after this, and she developed a knack for learning complex riffs by ear, quickly turning them into her own version. In 1981–82, Krauss performed with Marvin Lee Flessner&#x27;s country dance band, in which she fiddled and sang. In September 1983, her parents bought her a custom violin made by hand in Missouri – her first adult-sized instrument. At 13, she won the Walnut Valley Festival Fiddle Championship, and the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass in America named her the &quot;Most Promising Fiddler in the Midwest&quot;. She was also called &quot;virtuoso&quot; by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine.

Krauss first met Dan Tyminski around 1984 at a festival held by the Society. Every current member of her band, Union Station, first met her at these festivals.

==Career==
===1985–1991: Early career===
Krauss made her recording debut in 1986 on the independent album, &quot;Different Strokes&quot;, in collaboration with Swamp Weiss and Jim Hoiles, and featuring her brother Viktor Krauss. From the age of 12 she performed with bassist and songwriter John Pennell in a band called &quot;Silver Rail&quot;, replacing Andrea Zonn. Pennell later changed the band&#x27;s name to Union Station after another band was discovered with the name Silver Rail.

Later that year, she signed to Rounder Records, and in 1987, at 16, she released her debut album &quot;Too Late to Cry&quot; with Union Station as her backup band.

Krauss&#x27; debut solo album was quickly followed by her first group album with Union Station in 1989, &quot;Two Highways&quot;. The album includes the traditional tunes &quot;Wild Bill Jones&quot; and &quot;Beaumont Rag&quot;, along with a bluegrass interpretation of the Allman Brothers&#x27; &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;.

Krauss&#x27; contract with Rounder required her to alternate between releasing a solo album and an album with Union Station, and she released the solo album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got That Old Feeling&quot; in 1990. It was her first album to rise onto the Billboard charts, peaking in the top seventy-five on the country chart. The album also was a notable point in her career as she earned her first Grammy Award, the single &quot;Steel Rails&quot; was her first single tracked by Billboard, and the title single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got That Old Feeling&quot; was the first song for which she recorded a music video.

===1992–1999: Rising success===

Krauss&#x27; second Union Station album &quot;Every Time You Say Goodbye&quot; was released in 1992, and she went on to win her second Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album of the year. She then joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1993 at the age of 21. She was the youngest cast member at the time, and the first bluegrass artist to join the Opry in 29 years. She also collaborated on a project with the Cox Family in 1994, a bluegrass album called &quot;I Know Who Holds Tomorrow&quot;. Mandolin and guitar player Dan Tyminski replaced Tim Stafford in Union Station in 1994. Late in the year, Krauss recorded with the band Shenandoah on its single &quot;Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart&quot;, which brought her to the country music Top Ten for the first time and it won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Also in 1994, Krauss collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to contribute &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997, she recorded vocals and violin for &quot;Half a Mind&quot;, on Tommy Shaw&#x27;s 7 Deadly Zens album.

&quot;Now That I&#x27;ve Found You: A Collection&quot;, a compilation of older releases and some covers of her favorite works by other artists, was released in 1995. Some of these covers include Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;Oh Atlanta&quot;, the Foundations&#x27; &amp; Dan Schafer&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Now That I&#x27;ve Found You&quot;, which was used in the Australian hit comedy movie &quot;The Castle&quot;, and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Will&quot; with Tony Furtado. A cover of Keith Whitley&#x27;s &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart; the album peaked in the top fifteen on the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and sold two million copies to become Krauss&#x27; first double-platinum album. Krauss also was nominated for four Country Music Association Awards and won all of them.

&quot;So Long So Wrong&quot;, another Union Station album, was released in 1997 and won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album. One critic said its sound was &quot;rather untraditional&quot; and &quot;likely [to] change quite a few ... minds about bluegrass&quot;. Included on the album is the track &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot;, which was featured in the second-season premiere episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and was included on the &quot;Buffy&quot; soundtrack in 1999.

Her next solo release in 1999, &quot;Forget About It&quot;, included one of her two tracks to appear on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, &quot;Stay&quot;. The album was certified gold and charted within the top seventy-five of the Billboard 200 and in the top five of the country chart. In addition, the track &quot;That Kind of Love&quot; was included in another episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot;

===2000–present: Current career===
Adam Steffey left Union Station in 1998, and was replaced by renowned dobro player Jerry Douglas. Douglas had provided studio back-up to Krauss&#x27; records since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Too Late to Cry&quot;. Their next album, &quot;New Favorite&quot;, was released on August 14, 2001. The album went on to win the Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album, with the single &quot;The Lucky One&quot; winning a Grammy as well. &quot;New Favorite&quot; was followed up by the double platinum double album &quot;Live&quot; in 2002 and a release of a DVD of the same live performance in 2003. Both the album and the DVD were recorded during a performance at The Louisville Palace and both the album and DVD have been certified double Platinum. Also in 2002 she played a singing voice for one of the characters in the animated comedy film &quot;Eight Crazy Nights.&quot;

&quot;Lonely Runs Both Ways&quot; was released in 2004, and eventually became another Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station gold certified album. Ron Block described &quot;Lonely Runs Both Ways&quot; as &quot;pretty much... what we&#x27;ve always done&quot; in terms of song selection and the style, in which those songs were recorded. Krauss believes the group &quot;was probably the most unprepared we&#x27;ve ever been&quot; for the album and that songs were chosen as needed rather than planned. She also performed a duet with Brad Paisley on his album &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot; in the single &quot;Whiskey Lullaby&quot;. The single was quickly ranked in the top fifty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the top five of the Hot Country Songs, and won the Country Music Association Awards for &quot;Best Musical Event&quot; and &quot;Best Music Video&quot; of the year.
In 2007, Krauss and Robert Plant released the collaborative album titled &quot;Raising Sand&quot;. RIAA-certified platinum, the album was nominated for and won five Grammy Awards at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album, and Record of the Year (&quot;Please Read the Letter&quot;). Krauss and Plant recorded a Crossroads special in October 2007 for the Country Music Television network, which first aired on February 12, 2008.

Returning with Union Station, Krauss released an album called &quot;Paper Airplane&quot; on April 12, 2011, the follow-up album to &quot;Lonely Runs Both Ways&quot; (2004). Mike Shipley, the recording and mixing engineer for the album, said that the album had a lengthy production time because of Krauss&#x27; non-stop migraines. Nevertheless, &quot;Paper Airplane&quot; became Krauss&#x27;s highest-charting album in the U.S., reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on topping both the country and bluegrass album charts.

In 2014, Krauss and her band Union Station toured with Willie Nelson and Family, with special guests Kacey Musgraves, and the Devil Makes Three.

Capitol Records released &quot;Windy City&quot;, an album of country and bluegrass classics, produced by Buddy Cannon and her first solo release in 17 years, on February 17, 2017. Krauss received two nominations at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Country Solo Performance and Best American Roots Performance.

In August 2021, Krauss announced she was releasing a sequel album to &quot;Raising Sand&quot; with Robert Plant called &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;. The album was released in November that year, and Krauss and Plant went on tour as a duo.

In January 2025, it was announced that Union Station would be releasing their first album since 2011. &quot;Arcadia&quot; will be released on March 28, 2025, followed by an extensive tour.

===Other work===

Krauss has made guest appearances on other records on lead vocals, harmony vocals, and fiddle. In 1987, at the age of 15, she played fiddle on the album &quot;The Western Illinois Rag&quot; by Americana musician Chris Vallillo. In 1993 she recorded vocals for the Phish song &quot;If I Could&quot; in Los Angeles. In 1997 she sang harmony vocals in both English and Irish on the album &quot;Runaway Sunday&quot; by Irish traditional band Altan. In 1998 she played and sang on the title track of Hawaiian slack-key artist Ledward Kaapana&#x27;s album, &quot;Waltz of the Wind&quot;.

Krauss had her only number one hit in 2000, receiving vocal credit for &quot;Buy Me a Rose&quot;. She has contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks, most notably &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000). She and Dan Tyminski contributed multiple tracks, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; (with Gillian Welch), &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;, and &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. In the film, Tyminski&#x27;s vocals on &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; were used for George Clooney&#x27;s character. The soundtrack sold over seven million copies and won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 2002. Both Krauss and the surprisingly popular album were credited with reviving interest in bluegrass. She has said, however, that she believes Americans already liked bluegrass and other less-heard musical genres, and that the film merely provided easy exposure to the music. She did not appear in the movie, at her own request, because she was pregnant during its filming.

In 2007, Krauss released &quot;A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection,&quot; an album of new songs, soundtrack tunes, and duets with artists such as John Waite, James Taylor, Brad Paisley, and Natalie MacMaster. The album was successful commercially but given a lukewarm reception by critics. One of the tracks, &quot;Missing You&quot;, a duet with Waite (and a cover of his hit single from 1984), was similarly received as a single. On August 11, television network Great American Country aired a one-hour special, &quot;Alison Krauss: A Hundred Miles or More&quot;, based on the album.

Krauss appeared on Heart&#x27;s March 2010 concert DVD &quot;Night at Sky Church&quot;, providing the lead vocals for the song &quot;These Dreams&quot;.

Other soundtracks for which Krauss has performed include &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Bambi II&quot; and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. She contributed &quot;Jubilee&quot; to the 2004 documentary &quot;Paper Clips&quot;. The &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; songs she sang, &quot;The Scarlet Tide&quot; with T Bone Burnett and Elvis Costello, and &quot;You Will Be My Ain True Love&quot; with Sting, were each nominated for an Academy Award. She performed both songs at the 76th Academy Awards, the first with Costello and Burnett, and the other with Sting. She produced Nickel Creek&#x27;s debut album (2000) and the follow-up &quot;This Side&quot; (2002), which won Krauss her first Grammy award as a producer.

Krauss performed on &quot;Moody Bluegrass: A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues&quot;.

She participated in Billy Childs&#x27; 2014 tribute album to Laura Nyro, &quot;Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro&quot;, performing on the track &quot;And When I Die&quot;.

Krauss also appears on Def Leppard&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Diamond Star Halos&quot;, released March 2022, as a featured vocalist on the songs &quot;This Guitar&quot; and &quot;Lifeless&quot;. Krauss duetted with High Valley on the group&#x27;s 2023 single &quot;Do This Life&quot;. Krauss is featured on the song &quot;Thankful&quot; on Ringo Starr&#x27;s 2025 album &quot;Look Up&quot;.

==Reception and influences==

Krauss&#x27; earliest musical experience was as an instrumentalist, though her style has grown to focus more on her vocals with a band providing most of the instrumentation. Musicians she enjoys include vocalists Lou Gramm of Foreigner and Paul Rodgers of Bad Company. Krauss&#x27; family listened to &quot;folk records&quot; while she was growing up, but she had friends who exposed her to such acts as AC/DC, Carly Simon, the Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and ELO. She cites Dolly Parton, with whom she has since collaborated a number of times, as a major influence. Some credit Krauss and Union Station, at least partially, with a recent revival of interest in bluegrass music in the United States. Despite being together for nearly two decades and winning numerous awards, she said the group was &quot;just beginning right now&quot; (in 2002) because &quot;in spite of all the great things that have happened for the band, [she] feel[s] musically it&#x27;s just really beginning&quot;. Although she alternates between solo releases and works with the band, she has said there is no difference in her involvement between the two.

As a group, AKUS have been called &quot;American favourites&quot;, &quot;world-beaters&quot;, and &quot;the tightest band around&quot;. While they have been successful as a group, many reviews note Krauss still &quot;remains the undisputed star and rock-solid foundation&quot; and have described her as the &quot;band&#x27;s focus&quot; with an &quot;angelic&quot; voice that &quot;flows like honey&quot;. Her work has been compared to that of the Cox Family, Bill Monroe, and Del McCoury, and has in turn been credited with influencing various &quot;Newgrass&quot; artists including Nickel Creek, for which she acted as record producer on two of their albums. In addition to her work with Nickel Creek, she has acted as producer to the Cox Family, Reba McEntire and Alan Jackson. Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; has said Krauss and Union Station are &quot;superb, when they stick to hoedowns and hillbilly music, but much less convincing, when they lurch towards the middle of the road&quot;. &quot;Blender magazine&quot; has said the &quot;flavorless repertoire [Krauss] sings... steers her toward Lite FM&quot;. In addition, &quot;Q&quot; magazine and &quot;The Onion&quot; AV Club have said their newer releases are &quot;pretty much the usual&quot;, and that although Krauss is generally &quot;adventurous&quot;, these recent releases contain nothing to &quot;alienate the masses&quot;.

===Voice, themes, and musical style===
Krauss possesses a soprano voice, which has been described as &quot;angelic&quot;. 

She has said her musical influences include J. D. Crowe, Ricky Skaggs, and Tony Rice. Many of her songs are described as sad, and are often about love, especially lost love. Though Krauss has a close involvement with her group and a long career in music, she rarely performs music she has written herself. She has also described her general approach to constructing an album as starting with a single song and selecting other tracks based on the first, to give the final album a somewhat consistent theme and mood. She most commonly performs in the bluegrass and country genres, though she has had two songs on the adult contemporary charts, has worked with rock artists such as Phish and Sting, and is sometimes said to stray into pop music.

===Music videos===
Krauss did not think she would make music videos at the beginning of her career. After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. Dan Tyminski has noted that the video for &quot;Thriller&quot; was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the director of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Know Any Better&quot; from &quot;Lonely Runs Both Ways&quot;, for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with Def Leppard and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many – including for &quot;The Lucky One&quot;, &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Goodbye is All We Have&quot;, &quot;New Favorite&quot;, and &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Know Any Better&quot; – follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.

===Performances===
Krauss has said she used to dislike working in the studio, where she had to perform the same song repeatedly, but has come to like studio work roughly the same as live stage performances. Her own favorite concert experiences include watching three Foreigner concerts during a single tour, a Dolly Parton concert, and a Larry Sparks concert.

She appeared on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; in 1992 and opened the show in 1995 with Union Station. The &quot;New Favorite&quot; tour, after AKUS&#x27; album of the same name, was planned to start September 12, 2001 in Cincinnati, Ohio, but was delayed until September 28 in Savannah, Georgia following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Krauss took part in the &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot; tour in 2002, which featured many artists from the &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot; was followed by the &quot;Great High Mountain Tour&quot;, which was composed of musicians from both &quot;O Brother&quot; and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, including Krauss. She has also given several notable smaller performances including at Carnegie Hall (with the Grand Ole Opry), on Lifetime Television in a concert of female performers, on the radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, where she sang two songs not previously recorded on any of her albums, and a performance at the White House attended by then-President Bill Clinton and then-Vice President Al Gore. She has also been in the White House again, performing the song &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; at country music performances. She also performed a tribute to the Everly Brothers at which she sang &quot;All I Have to Do is Dream&quot; with Emmylou Harris and &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; with Vince Gill. She was also invited by Taylor Swift to perform with her at the 2013 CMA&#x27;s and by Joshua Bell to perform with him on a Christmas album; Bell said that &quot;she (Krauss) is someone I&#x27;ve adored for so many years now&quot;. She performed at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., on January 10, 2015, as a part of &quot;The Life and Songs of Emmylou Harris: An All Star Concert Celebration&quot; which is a tribute to Emmylou Harris.

==Awards and honors==
Krauss has won twenty-seven Grammy Awards over the course of her career as a solo artist, as a group with Union Station, as a duet with Robert Plant, and as a record producer. As of 2025, she ranks fifth on the list of winners of the most Grammy Awards. She overtook Aretha Franklin for the most female wins at the 46th Grammy Awards, where Krauss won three, bringing her total at the time to seventeen (Franklin won her sixteenth that night). The Recording Academy (which presents the Grammy Awards) presented her with a special musical achievement honor in 2005. She has also won 14 International Bluegrass Music Association Awards, 9 Country Music Association Awards, 2 Gospel Music Association Awards, 2 CMT Music Awards, 2 Academy of Country Music Awards, and 2 Canadian Country Music Awards. Country Music Television ranked Krauss 12th on their &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot; list in 2002.

At the 76th Academy Awards in February 2004, where she performed two nominated songs from the &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; soundtrack, Krauss was chosen by Hollywood shoe designer Stuart Weitzman to wear a pair of $2 million &#x27;Cinderella&#x27; sandals with 4½ inch clear glass stiletto heels and two straps adorned with 565 Kwiat diamonds set in platinum. Feeling like a rather unglamorous choice, Krauss said, &quot;When I first heard, I was like, &#x27;What were they thinking?&#x27; I have the worst feet of anybody who will be there that night!&quot; In addition to the fairy-tale-inspired shoes, Weitzman outfitted Krauss with a Palm Trēo 600 smartphone, bejeweled with 3,000 clear-and-topaz-colored Swarovski crystals. The shoes were returned, but Krauss kept the crystal-covered phone. Weitzman chose Krauss to show off his fashions at the urging of his daughters, who are fans of Krauss&#x27; music.
In May 2012, Alison Krauss was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

In March 2015, her hometown of Champaign, Illinois, designated the 400 block of West Hill Street as &quot;Honorary Alison Krauss Way&quot;.

On April 13, 2024, Krauss became a recipient of the Order of Lincoln, which is Illinois&#x27; highest civilian honor.

==Personal life==
Krauss was married to musician Pat Bergeson from 1997 to 2001. They have one child, born in 1999.

<doc id="466277" wikidata="Q874375" url="?curid=466277" title="St. Petersburg paradox">
<text>The St. Petersburg paradox or St. Petersburg lottery is a paradox involving the game of flipping a coin where the expected payoff of the lottery game is infinite but nevertheless seems to be worth only a very small amount to the participants. The St. Petersburg paradox is a situation where a naïve decision criterion that takes only the expected value into account predicts a course of action that presumably no actual person would be willing to take. Several resolutions to the paradox have been proposed, including the impossible amount of money a casino would need to continue the game indefinitely.

The problem was invented by Nicolas Bernoulli, who stated it in a letter to Pierre Raymond de Montmort on September 9, 1713. However, the paradox takes its name from its analysis by Nicolas&#x27; cousin Daniel Bernoulli, one-time resident of Saint Petersburg, who in 1738 published his thoughts about the problem in the &quot;Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg&quot;.

== The St. Petersburg game ==
A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The initial stake begins at 2 dollars and is doubled every time tails appears. The first time heads appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is the current stake. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if heads appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if tails appears on the first toss and heads on the second, 8 dollars if tails appears on the first two tosses and heads on the third, and so on. Mathematically, the player wins formula_1 dollars, where formula_2 is the number of consecutive tails tosses. What would be a fair price to pay the casino for entering the game?

To answer this, one needs to consider what would be the expected payout at each stage: with probability , the player wins 2 dollars; with probability the player wins 4 dollars; with probability the player wins 8 dollars, and so on. Assuming the game can continue as long as the coin toss results in tails and, in particular, that the casino has unlimited resources, the expected value is thus

This sum grows without bound so the expected win is an infinite amount of money.

== The paradox ==
Considering nothing but the expected value of the net change in one&#x27;s monetary wealth, one should therefore play the game at any price if offered the opportunity. Yet, Daniel Bernoulli, after describing the game with an initial stake of one ducat, stated, &quot;Although the standard calculation shows that the value of [the player&#x27;s] expectation is infinitely great, it has ... to be admitted that any fairly reasonable man would sell his chance, with great pleasure, for twenty ducats.&quot; Robert Martin quotes Ian Hacking as saying, &quot;Few of us would pay even $25 to enter such a game&quot;, and he says most commentators would agree. The apparent paradox is the discrepancy between what people seem willing to pay to enter the game and the infinite expected value.

== Solutions ==
Several approaches have been proposed for solving the paradox.

=== Expected utility theory ===

The classical resolution of the paradox involved the explicit introduction of a utility function, an expected utility hypothesis, and the presumption of diminishing marginal utility of money.

According to Daniel Bernoulli:

A common utility model, suggested by Daniel Bernoulli, is the logarithmic function (known as &quot;log utility&quot;). It is a function of the gambler&#x27;s total wealth , and the concept of diminishing marginal utility of money is built into it. The expected utility hypothesis posits that a utility function exists that provides a good criterion for real people&#x27;s behavior; i.e. a function that returns a positive or negative value indicating if the wager is a good gamble. For each possible event, the change in utility will be weighted by the probability of that event occurring. Let be the cost charged to enter the game. The expected incremental utility of the lottery now converges to a finite value:
This formula gives an implicit relationship between the gambler&#x27;s wealth and how much he should be willing to pay (specifically, any that gives a positive change in expected utility). For example, with natural log utility, a millionaire ($1,000,000) should be willing to pay up to $20.88, a person with $1,000 should pay up to $10.95, a person with $2 should borrow $1.35 and pay up to $3.35.

Before Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s 1738 publication, mathematician Gabriel Cramer from Geneva had already in 1728 found parts of this idea (also motivated by the St. Petersburg paradox), stating that

He demonstrated in a letter to Nicolas Bernoulli that a square root function describing the diminishing marginal benefit of gains can resolve the problem. However, unlike Daniel Bernoulli, he did not consider the total wealth of a person, but only the gain by the lottery.

This solution by Cramer and Bernoulli, however, is not completely satisfying, as the lottery can easily be changed in a way such that the paradox reappears. To this aim, we just need to change the game so that it gives even more rapidly increasing payoffs. For any unbounded utility function, one can find a lottery that allows for a variant of the St. Petersburg paradox, as was first pointed out by Menger.

Recently, expected utility theory has been extended to arrive at more behavioral decision models. In some of these new theories, as in cumulative prospect theory, the St. Petersburg paradox again appears in certain cases, even when the utility function is concave, but not if it is bounded.

=== Probability weighting ===
Nicolas Bernoulli himself proposed an alternative idea for solving the paradox. He conjectured that people will neglect unlikely events. Since in the St. Petersburg lottery only unlikely events yield the high prizes that lead to an infinite expected value, this could resolve the paradox. The idea of probability weighting resurfaced much later in the work on prospect theory by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Paul Weirich similarly wrote that risk aversion could solve the paradox. Weirich went on to write that increasing the prize actually decreases the chance of someone paying to play the game, stating &quot;there is some number of worth more than any number of birds in the bush&quot;. However, this has been rejected by some theorists because, as they point out, some people enjoy the risk of gambling and because it is illogical to assume that increasing the prize will lead to more risks.

Cumulative prospect theory is one popular generalization of expected utility theory that can predict many behavioral regularities. However, the overweighting of small probability events introduced in cumulative prospect theory may restore the St. Petersburg paradox. Cumulative prospect theory avoids the St. Petersburg paradox only when the power coefficient of the utility function is lower than the power coefficient of the probability weighting function. Intuitively, the utility function must not simply be concave, but it must be concave relative to the probability weighting function to avoid the St. Petersburg paradox. One can argue that the formulas for the prospect theory are obtained in the region of less than $400. This is not applicable for infinitely increasing sums in the St. Petersburg paradox.

=== Finite St. Petersburg lotteries ===
The classical St. Petersburg game assumes that the casino or banker has infinite resources. This assumption has long been challenged as unrealistic. Alexis Fontaine des Bertins pointed out in 1754 that the resources of any potential backer of the game are finite. More importantly, the expected value of the game only grows logarithmically with the resources of the casino. As a result, the expected value of the game, even when played against a casino with the largest bankroll realistically conceivable, is quite modest. In 1777, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon calculated that after 29 rounds of play there would not be enough money in the Kingdom of France to cover the bet.

If the casino has finite resources, the game must end once those resources are exhausted. Suppose the total resources (or maximum jackpot) of the casino are &quot;W&quot; dollars (more generally, &quot;W&quot; is measured in units of half the game&#x27;s initial stake). Then the maximum number of times the casino can play before it no longer can fully cover the next bet is . Assuming the game ends when the casino can no longer cover the bet, the expected value &quot;E&quot; of the lottery then becomes:
:formula_3
The following table shows the expected value &quot;E&quot; of the game with various potential bankers and their bankroll &quot;W&quot;:
Note: Under game rules which specify that if the player wins more than the casino&#x27;s bankroll they will be paid all the casino has, the additional expected value is less than it would be if the casino had enough funds to cover one more round, i.e. less than $1. For the player to win he must be allowed to play round . So the additional expected value is .

The premise of infinite resources produces a variety of apparent paradoxes in economics. In the martingale betting system, a gambler betting on a tossed coin doubles his bet after every loss so that an eventual win would cover all losses; this system fails with any finite bankroll. The gambler&#x27;s ruin concept shows that a persistent gambler who raises his bet to a fixed fraction of his bankroll when he wins, but does not reduce his bet when he loses, will eventually and inevitably go broke—even if the game has a positive expected value.

=== Ignore events with small probability ===
Buffon argued that a theory of rational behavior must correspond to what a rational decision-maker would do in real life, and since reasonable people regularly ignore events that are unlikely enough, a rational decision-maker should also ignore such rare events.

As an estimate of the threshold of ignorability, he argued that, since a 56-year-old man ignores the possibility of dying in the next 24 hours, which had a probability of 1/10189 according to the mortality tables of the day, events with less than 1/10,000 probability could be ignored. Assuming that, the St Petersburg game has an expected payoff of only formula_4.

=== Rejection of mathematical expectation ===
Various authors, including Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert and John Maynard Keynes, have rejected maximization of expectation (even of utility) as a proper rule of conduct. Keynes, in particular, insisted that the &quot;relative risk&quot; of an alternative could be sufficiently high to reject it even if its expectation were enormous. Recently, some researchers have suggested to replace the expected value by the median as the fair value.

=== Ergodicity ===
An early resolution containing the essential mathematical arguments assuming multiplicative dynamics was put forward in 1870 by William Allen Whitworth. An explicit link to the ergodicity problem was made by Peters in 2011. These solutions are mathematically similar to using the Kelly criterion or logarithmic utility. General dynamics beyond the purely multiplicative case can correspond to non-logarithmic utility functions, as was pointed out by Carr and Cherubini in 2020.

== Recent discussions ==
Although this paradox is three centuries old, new arguments have still been introduced in recent years.

=== Feller ===
A solution involving sampling was offered by William Feller. Intuitively Feller&#x27;s answer is &quot;to perform this game with a large number of people and calculate the expected value from the sample extraction&quot;. In this method, when the games of infinite number of times are possible, the expected value will be infinity, and in the case of finite, the expected value will be a much smaller value.

=== Samuelson ===
Paul Samuelson resolves the paradox by arguing that, even if an entity had infinite resources, the game would never be offered. If the lottery represents an infinite expected gain to the player, then it also represents an infinite expected loss to the host. No one could be observed paying to play the game because it would never be offered. As Samuelson summarized the argument, &quot;Paul will never be willing to give as much as Peter will demand for such a contract; and hence the indicated activity will take place at the equilibrium level of zero intensity.&quot;

=== Variants ===
Many variants of the St Petersburg game are proposed to counter proposed solutions to the game.

For example, the &quot;Pasadena game&quot;: let formula_5 be the number of coin-flips; if formula_5 is odd, the player gains units of formula_7; else the player loses formula_7 units of utility. The expected utility from the game is then formula_9. However, since the sum is not absolutely convergent, it may be rearranged to sum to any number, including positive or negative infinity. This suggests that the expected utility of the Pasadena game depends on the summation order, but standard decision theory does not provide a principled way to choose a summation order.

=== Use of decision-making models used in quantitative trading ===
One approach that is attracting much interest in solving the St Petersburg paradox is to use a parameter related to the cognitive aspect of a strategy. This approach was developed by studying nonergodic systems in finance. There is much research on the non-stationarity of the financial markets.

From a statistical point of view, knowledge of a phenomenon results in an increase in the probability of prediction. In practice, the results generated by a non-random prediction algorithm, which implements useful information, cannot be reproduced randomly (the probability tends to zero as the number of predictions made increases). Consequently, to understand whether a strategy operates cognitively or randomly, we need only calculate the probability of obtaining an equal or better outcome at random. In the case of the St. Petersburg paradox, the doubling strategy was compared with a constant bet strategy that was completely random but equivalent in terms of the total value of the bets. From this comparison, it is shown that a random constant bet strategy obtains better results with a probability that tends to 50% as the number of bets increases. If the doubling strategy exploited some useful information about the system this probability should tend to zero instead converging to 50%. This shows that this strategy does not use any useful information.

From this point of view, the St. Petersburg paradox teaches us that an expected gain that tends to infinity does not always imply the presence of a cognitive and non-random strategy. Consequently, from the decision-making point of view, we can create a hierarchy of values, in which knowledge turns out to be more important than expected gain.

<text>Walter Laing MacDonald Perry, Baron Perry of Walton (16 June 1921 – 17 July 2003) was a Scottish academic. He was the first Vice Chancellor of the Open University.

== Life ==
Perry was born in Dundee, son of Flora and Fletcher Perry, and educated at Ayr Academy and the High School of Dundee. He studied medicine at the University of St Andrews, graduating with an MB ChB in 1943, MD in 1948 and a DSc in 1958. Between 1944 and 1946 he worked as a Medical Officer in Nigeria. He later worked as a scientist for institutions like the Medical Research Council. In particular he became an expert on polio. He had a reputation for following the scientific method rigorously.

He developed his career at the University of Edinburgh as Professor of Pharmacology, later Dean of Medicine and Vice Principal. In 1959 he was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh. In 1969 he became Vice Chancellor of the Open University and made that university into an effective institution proving that sceptics had been wrong. He was mainly responsible for deciding that the Open University would not compromise on academic standards – he was determined that its qualifications should be of equal academic value to non-distance learning universities. Perry worked further to develop distance learning through the United Nations.

Perry was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1957 New Year Honours and was knighted in 1974.

He entered the House of Lords upon being created a life peer with the title Baron Perry of Walton, of Walton in the County of Buckinghamshire on 9 February 1979. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as a founder member in 1981, and was one of the signatories to the Limehouse Declaration. When the SDP merged with the Liberals in 1988 he chose instead to become a member of the anti-merger &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP, and was deputy leader of the new party&#x27;s peers from 1988 to 1989. He later took the Liberal Democrat whip, and served on the committee dealing with science and technology. He kept working right up to his death in 2003.

Perry married (1) Dr Anne Elizabeth Grant in 1946 (2) Catherine Hilda Crawley in 1971. His second wife&#x27;s sister Mary married Alun Michael and her brother married Christine Crawley, Baroness Crawley.

A collection of Walter Perry&#x27;s papers, containing work relating to the Open University, other distance education institutions and work for the House of Lords, are preserved in the Open University Archive.

<doc id="466285" wikidata="Q915439" url="?curid=466285" title="Reduced vertical separation minima">
<text>Reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM) is the reduction, from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet, of the standard vertical separation required between aircraft flying between flight level 290 (29,000 ft) and flight level 410 (41,000 ft). This reduction in vertical separation minimum therefore increases the number of aircraft that can fly in a particular volume of controlled airspace.

==Historical background==
In the 1940s (original ICAO regulations), standard separation was 1000 feet except in specific circumstances, when it was 500 feet. In 1958 the standard vertical separation of aircraft in controlled airspace was set at 1,000 feet from ground level or sea level to flight level 290, and at 2,000 feet above flight level 290. The larger minimum separation at higher altitudes was necessary because the accuracy of altimeters, used to determine altitude by measuring air pressure, decreases with height. Efforts to reduce this separation above flight level 290 began almost immediately, but doing so without compromising safety required improvements in altimeters and other equipment, due in part to inherent difficulties in accurately determining and maintaining aircraft altitudes and, therefore, the actual vertical distance between aircraft. It was not until the 1990s that air data computers (ADCs), altimeters, and autopilot systems became sufficiently accurate to safely reduce the vertical separation minimum. Thus, RVSM in effect constituted a return to the original procedures established in the mid-1940s, with the notable difference that 500 feet separation is only permitted between IFR and VFR flights (on non-converging tracks).

==Implementation==
Between 1997 and 2005 RVSM was implemented in all of Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia and North America, South America, and over the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. The North Atlantic implemented initially in March 1997 at flight levels 330 through 370. The entire western hemisphere implemented RVSM FL290–FL410 on January 20, 2005. Africa implemented it on September 25, 2008.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China implemented metric RVSM on 21 November 2007. But the Hong Kong FIR continued to use flight levels in feet.

The Russian Federation implemented RVSM and flight levels in feet on November 17, 2011. However, in some FIRs, meters are still in use below transition level.

==Requirements==
Only aircraft with specially certified altimeters and autopilots may fly in RVSM airspace, otherwise the aircraft must fly lower or higher than the airspace, or seek special exemption from the requirements. Additionally, aircraft operators (airlines or corporate operators) must receive specific approval from the aircraft&#x27;s state of registry to conduct operations in RVSM airspace. Non RVSM approved aircraft may transit through RVSM airspace provided they are given continuous climb/descent throughout the designated airspace, and 2,000 ft vertical separation is provided at all times between the non-RVSM flight, and all others for the duration of the climb/descent.

&quot;State aircraft&quot;, which includes aircraft used in military, customs and police service, are exempted from the requirement to be RVSM approved. Participating states have been requested, however, to adapt their state aircraft for RVSM approval, to the extent possible, and especially those aircraft used for General Air Traffic (GAT).

If the RVSM level is exceeded it is an &#x27;incident&#x27; and needs to be reported within 72 hours.

Equipment Requirements:
* Two independent altitude measuring systems
** For each condition in the full RVSM flight envelope, the largest combined absolute value for residual static source error plus the avionics error may not exceed 200 feet
* SSR (secondary surveillance radar) altitude reporting transponder
* Altitude alert system that signals an alert when the altitude displayed to the flight crew deviates from the selected altitude by more than (in most cases) 200 feet
* Autopilot with altitude control
** Within a tolerance band of ±65 feet about an acquired altitude when the aircraft is operated in straight-and-level flight
** Within a tolerance band of ±130 feet under no turbulent, conditions for aircraft for which application for type certification occurred on or before April 9, 1997 that are equipped with an automatic altitude control system with flight management/performance system inputs
* Flight Crew approved training program / Op Specs Approval
* No damage outside the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) limits in the RVSM critical areas
* Aircraft with TCAS must have compatibility with RVSM Operations

For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites; for other languages, fewer. Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content. Websites may or may not require a subscription; sites requiring a subscription are no longer noted in the article&#x27;s description.

On December 1, 2009, Google announced changes to their &quot;first click free&quot; program, which has been running since 2008 and allows users to find and read articles behind a paywall. The reader&#x27;s first click to the content is free, and the number after that would be set by the content provider. Google on December 1, 2009 changed their policy to allow a limit of five articles per day, in order to protect publishers from abuse. This policy was again changed on September 29, 2015 where this limit was changed to three articles per day. In October 2017, this program was replaced with a &quot;flexible sampling&quot; model in which each publisher chooses how many, if any, free articles were allowed.

The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on May 16, 2011.

On July 14, 2011, Google introduced &quot;Google News Badges&quot;, which it later retired in October 2012.

Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well. , this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News.

In June 2017, the desktop version of Google News saw a thorough redesign that according to Google had the goal to &quot;make news more accessible and easier to navigate ... with a renewed focus on facts, diverse perspectives, and more control for users.&quot; Yet several options such as the search tools menu were removed along with the redesign, making searches much more difficult. It now uses a card format for grouping related news stories, and as summarized by Engadget, &quot;doesn&#x27;t look like a search results page anymore&quot;, removing text snippets and blue links.

Historically users could choose to hide articles originating from a news source. These hidden sources can still be listed in a user&#x27;s settings however these exclusions are no longer honoured. The option to exclude a source of news items is no longer presented.

According to a 2020 study in the journal &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot;, Google News prioritizes local news outlets when individuals search for keywords specifically related to topics of local interest.

On October 18, 2023 Google confirmed they cut at least 40 jobs in the news division. Google clarified that: &quot;These internal changes have no impact on our misinformation and information quality work in News.&quot;

==Controversies with publishers==
===EU copyright and database right===
In March 2005, Agence France-Presse (AFP) sued Google for $17.5 million, alleging that Google News infringed on its copyright because &quot;Google includes AFP&#x27;s photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse&quot;. It was also alleged that Google ignored a cease and desist order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not. Google made arrangements, starting in August 2007, to host Agence France-Presse news, as well as the Associated Press, Press Association and the Canadian Press. In 2007, Google announced it was paying for Associated Press content displayed in Google News, however the articles are not permanently archived. That arrangement ceased on December 23, 2009 when Google News ceased carrying Associated Press content.

In 2007, a preliminary injunction and then a Belgian court ruled that Google did not have the right to display the lead paragraph from French-language Belgian news sources when Google aggregated news stories, nor to provide free access to cached copies of the full content (&quot;in cache&quot; feature), due to both copyright and database rights.
Google responded by removing the publications both from Google News and the main Google web search.
According to the 2009 &quot;Report on the outlook for copyright in the EU&quot;:

In May 2011 the ruling was upheld in appeal after Google reiterated most legal defences from the first grade plus some new ones, which the Court rejected based on the &quot;Infopaq&quot; ruling and others. In July 2011, Copiepress publications were restored on Google News after they requested so and renounced any complaint based on the judgement.

Nevertheless, in a 2017 briefing on the ancillary copyright for press publishers paid by the European Commission, Prof. Höppner thought the database right was not violated by most platforms on the basis that the &quot;substantial part&quot; criterion may be too high a bar after the 2002 decision in &quot;Fixtures Marketing v. OPAP&quot; and that no publisher was known to have won a case with it.

=== Compensation for disseminating access to news ===

The 2019 Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market requires Google News to license content from news sites. As of June 2023, Google had reached copyright licensing agreements with 1,500 publications in order to come into compliance with the Directive.

Lobbying by Europe-based news outlets goes back to at least the 2010s. In Germany, their lobbying led to the introduction of the ancillary copyright for press publishers in 2013. In October 2014, a group of German publishers granted Google a license to use snippets of their publications gratis; the group had first claimed that such snippets were illegal, and then complained when they were removed by Google. In December 2014, Google announced it would be shutting down the Google News service in Spain. A new law in Spain, lobbied for by the Spanish newspaper publishers&#x27; association AEDE, would require that news aggregators would have to pay news services for the right to use snippets of their stories on Google News. Google chose to shut down their service and remove all links to Spain-based news sites from international versions of the site. 

In 2012, Brazil&#x27;s National Association of Newspapers (AJN) jointly pulled out of allowing their content to be shown on Google News. The change resulted in only a &quot;negligible&quot; drop in traffic 

In October 2020, Google announced a new program known as &quot;Showcases&quot;, in which the company would pay publishers to curate featured news content displayed in branded panels on Google News and Discover. Showcases may occasionally include free access to paywalled content. The program was first launched in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The feature&#x27;s launch in Australia came amid the implementation of the country&#x27;s News Media Bargaining Code; Google stated that it believed the Showcase program was in compliance with the Code.

In response to the Online News Act, Google announced it would block all Canadian news sites from visitors located in Canada, when the act goes into effect near the end of 2023.

==Features and customization==
A pull-down menu at the top of search results enables users to specify the time period in which they wish to search for articles. This menu includes options such as: past day, past week, past month, or a custom range.

Users can request e-mail &quot;alerts&quot; on various keyword topics by subscribing to Google News Alerts. E-mails are sent to subscribers whenever news articles matching their requests come online. Alerts are also available via RSS and Atom feeds.

Users used to be able to customize the displayed sections, their location on the page, and how many stories are visible with a JavaScript-based drag and drop interface. However, for the US site, this has been disabled in favor of a new layout; roll-out of this layout is planned for other locales in the near future. Stories from different editions of Google News can be combined to form one personalized page, with the options stored in a cookie. The service has been integrated with Google Search History since November 2005. Upon its graduation from beta, a section was added that displays recommended news based on the user&#x27;s Google News search history and the articles the user has clicked on (if the user has signed up for Search History).

A revamped version of Google News was introduced in May 2018 that included artificial intelligence features to help users find relevant information.

==News Archive Search==
On June 6, 2006, Google News expanded, adding a News Archive Search feature, offering users historical archives going back more than 200 years from some of its sources. There was a timeline view available, to select news from various years.

An expansion of the service was announced on September 8, 2008, when Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers. The depth of chronological coverage varies; beginning in 2008, the entire content of the &quot;New York Times&quot; back to its founding in 1851 has been available.

In early 2010, Google removed direct access to the archive search from the main Google News page, advanced news search page and default search results pages. These pages indicated that the search covered &quot;Any time&quot;, but did not include the archive and only included recent news.

During the summer of 2010, Google decided to redesign the format of the Google news page. This redesign engendered significant complaints from regular users of the service.

In May 2011, Google cancelled plans to scan further old newspapers. About 60 million newspaper pages had been scanned prior to this event. Google announced that it would instead focus on &quot;Google One Pass, a platform that enables publishers to sell content and subscriptions directly from their own sites&quot;.

In August 2011, the &quot;News Archive Advanced Search&quot; functionality was removed entirely, again generating complaints from regular users who found that the changes rendered the service unusable. Archival newspaper articles could still be accessed via the Google News Search page, but key functionalities such as the timeline view and ability to specify more than 10 results per page were removed.

==Coverage artifacts==
On September 7, 2008, United Airlines, which was the subject of an indexed, archived article, lost and later not quite regained US$1 billion in market value when a 2002 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article about the bankruptcy filing of the airline in that year appeared in the current &quot;most viewed&quot; category on the website of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, a sister paper. Google News index&#x27;s next pass found the link as new news, and Income Security Advisors found the Google result to be new news, which was passed along to Bloomberg News, where it was briefly a current headline and very widely viewed.

<doc id="466300" wikidata="Q5230812" url="?curid=466300" title="David Appel (businessman)">
<text>David Appel (, born 7 August 1950) is an Israeli businessman, general contractor, and Likud party activist.

==Early life and education==
Appel was raised by his grandparents, and educated in an ORT technical dormitory school in Magdiel, where he studied printing. He was not drafted into the IDF due to an injury sustained when printing machinery fell on his hand. At age 20 he joined the Likud youth organisation, where he formed lifelong friendships with many people who would later become influential Israeli politicians.:

==Career==
In 1975 he opened a baby products store in Tel Aviv, which eventually became a national chain. He was also a partner in the Gazan UP-7 company. In 1977 he sold his chain and opened a general contracting firm with partner &quot;Shalom Prussak&quot;, which became state-recognised within three years and ultimately built thousands of housing units, many of them under contract for the Israeli Housing Ministry.:

===Corruption charges===
The Attorney General of Israel ruled that between 1983 and 1986, Appel&#x27;s contracting company had operated in a manner violating the law, and only 13 years later in 1997 he was cleared of all charges.

In 2003 the State again brought charges against Appel, this time dealing with four separate cases of bribery and dishonest business practices. The indictment charged that he had promised civil servants reelection in exchange for approving his projects in Central Israel, especially Lod and Giv&#x27;at Shmuel. Among those accused of accepting bribes were former MK Nehama Ronen, then director of the Environment Ministry, Israel Land Administration official Oded Tal, Lod mayor Benny Regev, and Giv&#x27;at Shmuel council head Zamir ben Ari.

In 2004 he was charged with bribing Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, in what became known as the Greek Island Affair, and was also charged with five other bribe offenses. Attorney General Menachem Mazuz eventually ruled that Sharon could not be charged with receiving bribes from Appel. As of September 2008 all but one bribery charge against Appel had been dropped.

In 2010 he was convicted of bribery and was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison. The accusation involved a bribe to Sharon to help win approval for a development in Greece. He also started bankruptcy proceedings. He submitted a bid to return to an active role in the Migdal Hazohar urban renewal project in the Giora neighborhood of Givat Schmuel in May 2016, which was two years after he finished his prison term in 2014.

<doc id="466301" wikidata="Q3266340" url="?curid=466301" title="Sledding">
<text>Sledding, sledging or sleighing is a winter sport typically carried out in a prone or seated position on a vehicle generically known as a sled (North American), a sledge (British), or a sleigh. It is the basis of three Olympic sports: luge, skeleton and bobsledding. When practised on sand, it is known as a form of sandboarding. In Russia sledges are used for maritime activities including fishing and commuting from island to island on ice. 
==History==
The practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. They were never developed in areas with inconsistent winter snow cover, as vehicles to transport materials and/or people failed, far more people walked than used wheeled vehicles in icy and snowy conditions. Early designs included hand-pulled sizes as well as larger dog, horse, or ox drawn versions. Early examples of sleds and sledges were found in the Oseberg Viking ship excavation. The Toboggan sled is also a traditional form of transport used by the Innu and Cree of northern Canada and the people of Ancient Egypt are thought to have used sledges (on the desert sand and on ramps) extensively for construction.

==Modern sledding==
The generic term sledding refers to traveling down a snowy hill using a sled such as a Flexible Flyer with wooden slats and metal runners. It is usually done during the winter when there is snow. Flat plastic or aluminum discs and improvised sleds (carrier bags, baking trays, cafeteria trays, sheets of cardboard, etc.) may also be used. The activity has been known to exist as a fringe recreational activity far into the distant murky past in toboggan-type sleds which seasonally supplant the ubiquitous cart.

==Back country sledding==

In contrast to the more common forms of sledding, back country sledding involves four important elements in combination: a great amount of directional control, flotation, a binding system, and padding. First, back country sleds are made of strong plastic material, with the snow-side surface possessing various grooves and chines for directional control. Second, the plastic construction, with a large amount of snow-side surface area keeps the sled afloat in deeper snow conditions (the same principle behind wider powder skis or snowboards). Though the original runner sleds possessed directional control, their thin runner blades bogged down in anything but icy or thin snow conditions. Disk sleds, on the other hand, possessed flotation but no directional control. Third, modern back country sleds have a binding system, which usually consists of a simple belt strap that attaches to the sides of the sled. With the sledder in the kneeling position, the strap may go over the sledder&#x27;s thighs or calves before connecting with the strap from the other side of the sled with some sort of buckling device. Finally, back country sleds have foam pads glued for the sledder to kneel on for shock absorption. One such sled is the Mad River Rocket.

Back country sledding is a closer kin to back country alpine skiing or snowboarding than to traditional &quot;pile the family in the van and go to the local hill&quot; type of sledding. The terrain for back country sledding includes powder-filled steeps, open mountain bowls, cliff-filled ridges, and basically anywhere that one finds the powder, steeps, rocks and trees. Back country sleds, with the binding system and padding, may also be used for freestyle moves such as spins and flips off jumps and rail slides. Though similarities exist between back country sledding and alpine skiing/snowboarding, important differences separate the disciplines. From a technical perspective, the lack of a metal edge and the lower center of gravity make it more difficult to control a back country sled on icy or packed snow surfaces. From an access perspective, alpine resorts do not allow sledding on the actual mountain, except for the occasional small tubing hill.

==Recreational sledding techniques==

The first ride down a hill on a sled is the most important, but also the most difficult, as it determines the path of the sled for further runs down the hill. It is essential to steer the sled along the most exciting course, perhaps adding twists and turns to make the run down the hill faster or more exciting. Other techniques to improve the ride include turning around, lying on the stomach, or closing both eyes. Running up to a sled and jumping onto it can create additional momentum and improve ride speed. This technique can be referred to as &quot;Flopping.&quot;

There are five types of sleds commonly used today: runner sleds, toboggans, disks, tubes and backcountry sleds. Each type has advantages and disadvantages if one is trying to get the most out of a given slope.

With each course down the hill, the sled&#x27;s path through the snow can become more icy. Sleds with a greater surface area (anything but runner sleds) are able to make the first runs a great deal easier than the variety of sleds with metal runners. Runner sleds are typically faster once the snow has compacted or turned icy. In the 1880s, Samuel Leeds Allen invented the first steerable runner sled, the Flexible Flyer. Since that date, the ability to steer the sled away from obstacles has led people to believe it to be more appropriate choice for the safety conscious. On the other hand, the hard wood or metal front section of steerable runner sleds is far more likely to cause serious injury if it strikes a person, or if the hands are caught between the steering mechanism and a solid object in a crash. Each year, around 30,000 children in the US are injured in sledding, with one in 25 injuries requiring hospitalization. In a majority of these serious cases, young children are riding runner sleds in a prone position, and suffer hand and finger injuries when they are caught under the runners or between the sled and another object. In addition, runner sleds force the weight of the rider onto two thin runners where the pressure causes a microscopic film of snow or ice to melt as the sled passes over it. This invisible layer of fluid reduces friction, causing the sled&#x27;s speed to greatly exceed that of its flat bottomed relatives.

With the control of a backcountry sled, stunts become possible. Sledding off cliffs and doing tricks off jumps is known as extreme sledding.

==Competitive sledding==
Sweden and Norway recorded some early Kicksled Races during the 15th century. The modern sport of sledding (Luge – Skeleton and Bobsledding) originated in St. Moritz, Switzerland in the mid-to-late 19th century when vacationing guests adapted delivery sleds for recreational purposes and from there, it quickly spread to Davos and other Swiss towns and villages.

Modern competitive sledding started in 1883 in Davos, Switzerland. An Australian student named George Robertson won what is reputed to be the world’s first international sled race. He outraced 19 other competitors from England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States on a four kilometre stretch of road from St. Wolfgang to the town of Klosters. Soon the Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton were developed in succession. By mid-decade, Kulm Hotel owner Caspar Badrutt had the first run or course purpose built for the fledgling sport. The opening of formal competition for Luge was in 1883 and for Bobsleds in 1884 at St. Moritz. in 1926, the International Olympic Committee declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St. Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules. It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton itself was added permanently to the Olympic program with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

There are three Olympic sledding competitions. Bobsled: Men&#x27;s two and four-crew, Women&#x27;s 2 crew. Luge: Men&#x27;s singles, Men&#x27;s doubles, Women&#x27;s singles (Team Relay – Olympic discipline starting in 2014). Skeleton: Men&#x27;s singles, Women&#x27;s singles

<text>The Republican Party of Minnesota is the state affiliate of the Republican Party in Minnesota and the oldest active political party in the state. Founded in 1855, the party is headquartered in Edina, and the current chairman is Alex Plechash.

Starting in 2025 and as a result of the 2024 elections, the Republican Party of Minnesota does not have substantial power in the state, holding no statewide executive offices or U.S. Senate seats. It holds a one-seat majority in the Minnesota House of Representatives and a one-seat minority in the Senate. The party controls four of Minnesota&#x27;s eight congressional districts. The last Republican governor of the state was Tim Pawlenty, who served from 2003 to 2011.

==History==

===Early history===

The Republican Party in Minnesota was the dominant party in the state for approximately the first seventy years of Minnesota&#x27;s statehood, from 1858 through the 1920s. In the Civil War, the state supported Abolitionism and the Union.

Republican candidates routinely won the state governorship as well as most other state offices, having 12 out of the first 13.

The 1892 Republican National Convention was held in Minneapolis. The party was aided by an opposition divided between the Democratic Party and the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party, which eventually merged in 1944.

===Independent-Republican era===

The Independent-Republicans of Minnesota (I-R) was the name of the party from November 15, 1975, until September 23, 1995. The name change was made because the &quot;Republican&quot; name was damaged by the Watergate Scandal. Polls conducted in the early-mid-1970s indicated people in Minnesota were more likely to vote for a candidate who identified as an &quot;Independent&quot; versus a &quot;Republican&quot;. During that time, the state party became more dependent on grassroots fundraising and eventually went bankrupt. After the national party pumped money into the party, in the early-mid-1980s, their image and base began turning more conservative. During this time the party held both US Senate seats and briefly controlled the state House of Representatives. By 1994, the grassroots had turned socially more conservative and changed the name back in 1995. Attempts to drop the term &quot;Independent&quot; had previously been defeated in 1989, 1991 and 1993.

===2000-2010s===

For the 2006 U.S. Senate election, the party endorsed Mark Kennedy for United States Senate, who lost to Amy Klobuchar.

In the 2008 U.S. Senate election, incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman was defeated by Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate Al Franken by 312 votes out of over 2.5 million cast after a long series of dramatic, contentious, and expensive re-counts.

The party was fined $170,000 for violating federal campaign finance regulations from 2003 to 2008. The Chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party Tony Sutton (R) was found guilty of circumventing Finance Laws in the Gubernatorial Election Recount of 2010 and fined $33,000. (2010)

The last Republican Governor of Minnesota was Tim Pawlenty. He was elected in 2002; after winning re-election in 2006, he served two terms. With Tom Emmer&#x27;s defeat in 2010 by Mark Dayton, Republicans held the governorship for eight years. Despite having lost every executive race in the general election of 2010, the party captured both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature for the first time since the 1970s, and defeated 18-term Rep. Jim Oberstar by electing Chip Cravaack to Minnesota&#x27;s 8th district.

====2010 gubernatorial race====

For the 2010 statewide elections, the party endorsed State Representative Tom Emmer and Metropolitan Council member Annette Meeks for governor and lieutenant governor. State Representative Dan Severson was the endorsed candidate for secretary of state. Attorney and psychologist Chris Barden was the endorsed candidate for attorney general. Patricia Anderson was the endorsed candidate for state auditor. All five executive candidates lost their respective elections.

Following the 2010 gubernatorial recount, the Minnesota GOP was heavily in debt, owing $2 million primarily for the recount of votes. The GOP had stopped paying rent for its headquarters near the Capitol and the landlord filed an eviction summons once the Party had fallen $111,000 behind in rent. They announced they would move their headquarters to Minneapolis&#x27;s Seward neighborhood in January 2014. The new headquarters is situated diagonally across from the Seward Community Cafe where it shares a building with a Pizza Luce. Party Chairman Keith Downey said they were moving away from St. Paul &quot;to be closer to the people.&quot; The headquarters were later moved to Edina.
Despite this, in 2010, Republicans had taken control of both houses of the State Legislature for the first time in three decades, only to lose both houses in 2012.

===Recent history===

In 2021, the Minnesota Republican Party became a subject of controversy when donor and strategist Anton Lazzaro was indicted for sex trafficking charges. Minnesota Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan resigned amidst the controversy.

The party ran Scott Jensen for the 2022 gubernatorial race, who lost to incumbent Tim Walz. The party also lost its majority in the Minnesota Senate, giving the DFL a trifecta, but the party held to the four seats in the US House of Representatives.

==Ideology and voter-base==

The Minnesota Republicans have a strong voter base in rural and suburban parts of .

=== 2022 Party Platform ===

In the party&#x27;s 2022 platform, the party opposed abortion access, calling for the overturning of Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which subsequently happened, and the Minnesota Doe v. Gomez, which is still standing. It also opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage. They also &quot;support the prohibition of Ranked Choice Voting in Minnesota.&quot; On gun policy, the statement says that citizens who follow the law should &quot;have the right to purchase and possess firearms, free from any gun registration system.&quot; For education, the platform also opposes &quot;any element of Critical Race Theory or associated curricula and programs.&quot;

==Current elected officials==

The Minnesota Republican Party holds none of the five statewide elected offices, neither United States Senate seat, and four of the state&#x27;s eight United States House of Representatives seats. It holds a minority in both the Minnesota Senate and the Minnesota House of Representatives.

===Members of Congress===
====U.S. Senate====
* None

Both of Minnesota&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats have been held by Democrats since 2009. Norm Coleman was the last Republican to represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate.

====U.S. House of Representatives====
Out of the eight seats Minnesota is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, 4 are held by Republicans:
===Statewide offices===
* None

Minnesota has not elected any GOP candidates to statewide office since 2006, when Tim Pawlenty was narrowly re-elected as governor. In 2010, Pawlenty opted not to seek re-election to a third term. State representative Tom Emmer ran as the Republican nominee in the 2010 election and was subsequently defeated by Democratic challenger Mark Dayton.

<doc id="466308" wikidata="Q525270" url="?curid=466308" title="American Kenpo">
<text>American Kenpo Karate (), also known as American Kenpo or Ed Parker&#x27;s Kenpo Karate, is an American martial art founded and codified by Ed Parker. It is synthesized mainly from Japanese and Okinawan martial arts such as karate and judo, with influence from Chinese martial arts. It is a form and descendant of Kenpō.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Kenpō&quot; (or Kempo) is an English transliteration of a Ryukyuan and Japanese pronunciation of Chinese characters 拳法. In Chinese, these characters are read as Kuen Fat (Cantonese) or Quánfǎ (Mandarin). In either language, the meaning of the term is &#x27;Fist Method&#x27;. It is a term synonymous with Chinese Martial Arts. In martial arts such as American Kenpo and Shorinji Kempo, the term &#x27;Kenpo&#x27; is therefore use to imply a historical and technical connection to Chinese Martial Arts.

==History==
===Early history===
American Kenpo evolved from Chinese and Japanese roots. One predecessor, the martial art of Ken Fat, came to America with Cantonese immigrants through the creation of Tongs. Ken Fat was refined by the Southern Chinese and spread into Fujian and Canton; later, various styles developed in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Ryukyu (Okinawa), Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Japan.

The de facto modern history of American Kenpo began in 1933 when Thomas Miyashiro began openly teaching Kenpo in Hawaii alongside Mizuho Mutsu and Kamesuke Higashiona, students of Choki Motobu. They toured Hawaii, publicly demonstrating Kenpo in support of the state&#x27;s first public Kenpo dojo. They were featured in numerous local newspapers and increased the sport&#x27;s popularity in Hawaii. They also used books by Mizuho Mutsu and Choki Motobu, the most detailed books on Kenpo of their time. Another Japanese-American martial artist, James Mitose, began teaching the art in 1936 and started a formal Kenpo school in Hawaii in 1941.

Simultaneously, the Chee Kong Tong in Maui had been teaching Cantonese Ken Fat to Cantonese immigrants since the 1920s. Sun Chow Hoon emigrated from Canton and trained in Ken Fat at the Tong HQ when he first arrived in Maui. He also taught his eldest son, William Chow, who became an enforcer for the Tong. William Chow studied multiple martial arts in Hawaii, including Kenpo with James Mitose and Danzan Ryu Jujutsu with his brother John Chow. William often used his Ken Fat knowledge to devise counters for Jujutsu techniques. Chow eventually developed his unique style that blended his Chinese Martial Arts training with the more focused Ryukyuan Kenpo methods popularized in Hawaii. He used many different names for the style, but most refer to his method as &quot;Kenpo Karate.&quot; Chow&#x27;s Kenpo Karate used linear and circular motion and emphasized practical fighting techniques to outperform other martial arts common in Hawaii. As he taught, Chow experimented and modified his art, adapting it to meet the needs of American students.

===Ed Parker===

American Kenpo as its own art was founded by Ed Parker. Parker started his martial arts training in Judo, earning a black belt. He then studied western boxing from his father, a boxing commissioner in Hawaii, before training in Kenpo Karate with Chow and earning a black belt.

After Parker moved to California, he cross-referenced his martial arts knowledge with Chinese martial arts masters there. Some of his California influences include Lau Bun, Ark Wong, Ming Lum, James Lee, and Bruce Lee. In California, Parker hosted a large martial arts tournament, the Long Beach Internationals, where he popularized martial artists and gave many legends their start. It was out of this work that Parker founded American Kenpo.

In 1954, Parker started teaching other Hawaiian Islanders while studying at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. By 1956, he was teaching commercially in Provo. Late in 1956, he opened a studio in Pasadena, California and founded the International Kenpo Karate Association (IKKA), where he served as Senior Grandmaster. He published &quot;Kenpo Karate: Law of the Fist and the Empty Hand,&quot; a book about his early system, in 1960. The book shows a heavy Japanese influence in his early style, incorporating linear and circular movements, &quot;focused&quot; techniques, and jujutsu-style locks, holds, and throws. When Parker began incorporating more Chinese arts into his system, he began to refer to his art as Chinese Kenpo. Based on this influence, he wrote &quot;Secrets of Chinese Karate&quot;, published in 1963.

By 1975, Ed Parker&#x27;s system, now known as American Kenpo, was a combination of older methods revised to work in more modern fighting scenarios. Throughout his career, he heavily restructured American Kenpo&#x27;s forms and techniques, moving away from forms recognizable from other arts like Hung Gar. He established a more definitive relationship between forms in the martial art and techniques from his self-defense curriculum. He also eschewed esoteric Eastern concepts, sought to express the art through Western scientific principles and metaphors, dropped most Asian language elements, and altered traditions to favor American English. Although he was challenged numerous times by experts and masters from multiple other martial arts, he remained well-respected in the martial arts world.

American Kenpo today has several different curricula, due to various reasons:
::* Parker&#x27;s art evolved over time, so his students learned a different curriculum depending on when they studied with him.
::* Many instructors left Parker before his later updates to the system.
::* After Parker&#x27;s death, various instructors changed the way the art was taught.

Parker did not name a successor as Senior Grandmaster of the IKKA. He instead entrusted his senior students to continue his teachings in their own ways.

==Features==
===Common elements===
Although each American Kenpo school differs in content and methodology, many basic principles, concepts, and theories remain the same. Some common elements are:
* &quot;Marriage of Gravity&quot; — Students are taught to settle their body weight to increase striking force.
* Every block is a strike; every strike is a block — Blocks are meant to be directed and forceful enough to injure an opponent, decreasing their ability to continue an attack. Strikes counter an opponent&#x27;s movement, reducing their ability to mount an attack.
* Point of origin — Any natural weapon is moved directly from where it originates, rather than cocking it before deploying it. This helps to eliminate the telegraphing of moves.
* Economy of motion — Practitioners should &quot;choose&quot; the best available target, &quot;choose&quot; the best available weapon, &quot;and choose&quot; the best open angle in the least amount of time to get the desired result.
* Personalization — Once students learn the lesson embodied in the &quot;ideal phase&quot; of the technique, they should search for an aspect tailored to their needs and strengths.

===Techniques===
American Kenpo emphasizes fast techniques to disable an attacker in seconds. It contains a wide array of open-hand, elbow, and knee strikes, kicks, punches, finger strikes, throwing and joint locking techniques, and club and knife skills. Kicks are less common and are usually directed at the lower body, as high kicks are slower to execute and potentially compromise the practitioner&#x27;s balance. Higher kicks are taught to more advanced and capable practitioners.

The art develops environmental awareness, structural stability, balance, coordination, flow, speed, power, and timing in that order as the student progresses through a step-by-step curriculum. Memorization of the system is optional for gaining functional skills and primarily used b instructors. All American Kenpo students are taught how, when, and why to execute each basic movement in the system.

Ed Parker emphasized concepts and principles over sequences of motion. He did not want his students to mimic him but to tailor his system to their own circumstances and needs. Thus, it is not a traditional art but a combat science designed to evolve as the practitioners&#x27; understanding improves. The burden of effectiveness is on the individual practitioner. It is up to them to make their American Kenpo applications effective by correctly applying the concepts and principles to the instructor&#x27;s ideal phase techniques.

====Forms====
By the time of his death in December 1990, Parker had created eleven forms, three short and eight long. He also created 154 named &quot;ideal phase&quot; technique sequences with 96 extensions, taught in three stages: Ideal Phase, What-if Phase, and Formulation Phase.

===Instruction methods===
Beginners are introduced to the concepts and principles of the system through scripted scenarios that serve as starting points for further exploration. Parker&#x27;s approach to American Kenpo was to teach martial arts as an updated and practical science tailored to the needs of the individual, hoping to turn each practitioner from a follower into an innovator. The mountain of motion and principles are available, but after learning the basics, students specialize in whatever areas fit their needs and desires.

Training in this manner aims to increase physical coordination and continuity with linear and circular motion. When correctly executed, each movement leads into the next, keeping the adversary&#x27;s &quot;dimensional zones&quot; in check and limiting their ability to retaliate. Should the adversary not react as anticipated, a skilled Kenpo practitioner can seamlessly transition into an alternative and appropriate action drawn spontaneously from the trained subconscious. In American Kenpo, a practitioner never tries to select a specific technique in the middle of a sudden, violent altercation, rather letting their body do what the Kenpo training has already ingrained in them.

Students are encouraged to formulate a logical sequence of action that removes the dangers of what-if scenarios, effectively turning a what-if problem into an even-if solution. Every American Kenpo black belt will have a unique and tailored style. Parker published minimum requirements for each belt rank instructor in the IKKA to follow. However, if a Kenpo Instructor starts their own association, they can select their students&#x27; base curriculum as they see fit.

==International Kenpo Karate Association==
The International Kenpo Karate Association (IKKA) was founded by Ed Parker in 1956 to formalize and govern the sport.

===Logo===

The IKKA logo was designed by Dave Parker, Ed Parker&#x27;s brother, in 1958. The design is meant to symbolically represent the art&#x27;s modernized form while simultaneously acknowledging the roots of American Kenpo in traditional Chinese and Japanese martial arts.

;Tiger: The tiger represents the early stage of training through bravery, power, and physical strength. In this early stage, it is important to work on the basics (e.g., the horse stance) to prepare the body for later advancement. 
;Dragon: The dragon represents the later stage of a martial artist&#x27;s training through quintessence, fluidity, agility, and spiritual strength. It is placed above the tiger on the crest to symbolize the importance of mental and spiritual strength over physical strength, implying that martial artists must have a good conscience to guide their actions. 
;Circle: The circle represents continuity.
;Dividing lines: The lines within the circle represent the original methods of attack first learned by ancient practitioners of Chinese martial arts, as well as the pathways through which an object could travel.
;Colors: The colors represent levels of proficiency within the art, alluding to the colored belt ranking system: white for the beginning stages, black for the expert stages, and red for professorship.
;Chinese characters: The choice of Chinese characters acknowledges the art&#x27;s Eastern roots. The characters on the right translate to &quot;Law of the Fist&quot; (拳法, for Kenpo) and &quot;Tang/Chinese Hand&quot; (唐手, for Karate). The characters on the left translate to &quot;Spirit of the Dragon and the Tiger.&quot;
;Shape: The logo&#x27;s shape represents a house with an axe shape on the bottom. The walls and roof are curved to keep evil from intruding. The axe is a solemn reminder that should a martial artist tarnish the reputation of the organization, they will be &quot;cut off&quot; completely.

==Belt rankings==
American Kenpo has a graded colored belt system consisting of white, yellow, orange, purple, blue, green, 1st- through 3rd-degree brown, and 1st- through 10th-degree black. Different Kenpo organizations and schools may have other belt systems.

The black belt ranks are indicated by half-inch red &#x27;tips&#x27; up to the 4th degree and a 5-inch &#x27;block&#x27; for the 5th. After that, additional half-inch stripes are added up to the 9th degree. For 10th degree black belt, two 5-inch &#x27;blocks&#x27; separated by a half-inch space are used. In some styles, an increasing number of stripes on both sides of the belt can indicate black belt ranks.

===Syllabus===
Depending on the school, there are different requirements per belt. Parker&#x27;s IKKA schools used a 24-techniques-per-belt syllabus, but some schools today have adopted a 16–20–24 technique syllabus as their standard. The 24-24-24 and 16–20–24 technique syllabuses contain the same techniques, but the latter groups them differently, with fewer techniques at lower belt levels and more total belt levels.

In addition to self-defense techniques, Parker set specific criteria for proficiency at each level. The requirements include basics categorized by stances, blocks, parries, punches, strikes, finger techniques, kicks, and foot maneuvers. They also include specialized moves and methods, such as joint dislocations, chokes, take-downs, throws, and other grappling components.

Beyond proficiency, a student&#x27;s character and attitude can be analyzed as a significant consideration in the promotion to a new rank. Promotion after a third-degree black belt has more to do with contributions made back to the art, such as teaching and other great works of exploration. For example, a third-degree black belt who further explores defending against a knife and brings that knowledge back may be promoted for his excellent contributions.

<text>Ice blocking is a recreational activity in which individuals race to the bottom of a hill sitting on large blocks of ice. In the United States ice blocking is thought to be regional, occurring in the West. The only equipment needed is some large blocks of thick ice and clothing, preferably padded. Hessian sacks or old towels have been recommended to sit on. Enthusiasts have been known to make &quot;customized&quot; ice blocks by freezing ropes into them to act as handles, and mixing colouring agents into the water prior to freezing.

Successful ice blocking requires the outdoor temperature to be above freezing, as the ice block needs to melt in order to be slippery. Short grass is reported to give the best experience, due to lower drag and hence higher speed. If the hill is not sufficiently steep or the grass too long, or the outdoor temperatures too cold, ice blocking will not work. If the grass is wet or becomes wet from continued ice blocking, speeds will increase significantly. Hazards include falls, bruises, bug bites and getting wet and covered in mud. The bottom of the slope being used should be a wide area free from obstructions.

In Fresno, California the sport has been embraced by high school students, who frequent parks during late night hours in an effort to evade law enforcement officers. Ice blocking was once a very popular night time activity at Hillcrest Park in Fullerton, California, but has subsided since its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. The sport has a long-standing tradition at Southern Nazarene University (Bethany, Oklahoma), where the Student Government Association holds the event annually. In 2011, TLC&#x27;s series &quot;Sister Wives&quot; highlighted ice blocking in the first episode of their second season. This episode showed the polygamist family spending an afternoon picnic ice blocking at a park.

Excessive pressure on the grass from ice blocking can damage the grass and has resulted in the activity often being banned or restricted by park authorities and groundskeepers. There are commercially-available snow sleds that incorporate the concept of ice blocking for use during summer. The lighter and thinner ice blocks used in these sleds (as well as a larger surface area than traditional ice blocks) may reduce damage to the grass.

<text>The list of human cell types provides an enumeration and description of the various specialized cells found within the human body, highlighting their distinct functions, characteristics, and contributions to overall physiological processes. Cells may be classified by their physiological function, histology (microscopic anatomy), lineage, or gene expression.

== Total number of cells ==
The adult human body is estimated to contain about 30 trillion (3×1013) human cells, with the number varying between 20 and 100 trillion depending on factors such as sex, age, and weight. Additionally, there are approximately an equal number of bacterial cells. The exact count of human cells has not yet been empirically measured in its entirety and is estimated using different approaches based on smaller samples of empirical observation. It is generally assumed that these cells share features with each other and thus may be organized as belonging to a smaller number of types.

== Classification ==

As a definition of &quot;cell type&quot; is yet to be agreed, it is not possible yet to arrive at a precise number of human cell types. There is, for example, significant variation in these cell types depending on the specific surface proteins they possess.

An extensive listing of human cell types was published by Vickaryous and Hall in 2006, collecting 411 different types of human cells (with 145 types of neuron among those).

The Human Cell Atlas project, which started in 2016, had as one of its goals to &quot;catalog all cell types (for example, immune cells or brain cells) and sub-types in the human body&quot;. By 2018, the Human Cell Atlas description based the project on the assumption that &quot;our characterization of the &quot;hundreds&quot; of types and subtypes of cells in the human body is limited&quot;, but the word &quot;hundreds&quot; was removed in later versions.

On 2021, Stephen Quake guessed that the upper limit of the number of human cell types would be around 6000, based on a reasoning that &quot;if biologists had discovered only 5% of cell types in the human body, then the upper limit of cell types to discover is somewhere around 6000 (i.e., 300/0.05).&quot;

Other different efforts have used different numbers. A count of &quot;cells&quot; in the human body published in 2023 divided the cells in about 400 types to perform the calculation. 

In 1996, scientists revealed a &#x27;map&#x27; of 16,000 human genes. This led to estimates that humans likely had around 100 000 genes (or regions that code for human proteins). However, actual sequencing did not start before around 1999, and it was not until 2003 that the first complete draft of a human genome revealed that there was roughly 20000-25000 protein-coding genes, as most DNA does not code for any protein. It is difficult to say that there have not been similar mistakes when estimating how many cells humans have as there are still substantial gaps in understanding human cells.

== Efforts to characterize all human cell types ==
Several efforts have been made to make a list or a map of all human cells. One of the largest and most recent is the HuBMAP (Human BioMolecular Atlas Program).

The HuBMAP project has organized 1551 different samples in 17 collections, each dedicated to a different system. However, this project still only mapped about 31 of the human bodies&#x27; 70 organs. Their datasets and visualisations place great emphasis on biomarkers and location in the body, but less on cell development and how cells can change over time. Usually specific surface proteins are used to identify cells, and based on this they are put into different categories.

Another major effort to make an overview of these proteins that allows us to observe cell types is the Human Protein Atlas.

A similar project, the Human Brain Project has also attempted to map the human brain, although much of the publicly accessible model does not have cellular resolution.

== Standards and naming conventions ==

So far not all cells which can be found in the human body have been documented. There is no good way to make the experiment where one checks if all cell types identified so far could be taken from and measured in a single donor, proving that the cell types are universal to all humans. This is partly due to a lack of standards, as scientists are still not entirely sure what is needed to measure, in order to capture every cell type which can be found.

Some attempts have been made – and some are still in progress– for creating standards for identifying cells consistently. The Cell Ontology provides arguably the most comprehensive metadata standard to date, cataloging over 2500 cell classes and being used actively by the Human Cell Atlas community.

There is still no standard which is used industry wide, nor any definitions which have been accepted by the wider scientific community. Often making it difficult to say whether some collected and observed cells are really one or multiple types of cells. This lack of standards makes it difficult to estimate how many cell types and how many of each cell types can be found in the human body, as well as difficult to predict which young cells one would need to develop with mature cells. The list on this Wikipedia article also suffers to some inconsistencies due to multiple sources using different conventions.

==== Nervous system ====
There are nerve cells, also known as neurons, present in the human body. They are branched out. These cells make up nervous tissue.
A neuron consists of a cell body with a nucleus and cytoplasm, from which long thin hair-like parts arise.

<doc id="466318" wikidata="Q4934106" url="?curid=466318" title="Bob Stokoe">
<text>Robert Stokoe (21 September 1930 – 1 February 2004) was an English footballer and manager who was able, almost uniquely, to transcend the traditional north-east animosity between the region&#x27;s footballing rivals, Newcastle United and Sunderland. As a player, he won an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal with Newcastle in 1955. As a manager, he guided Blackpool to victory in the 1971 Anglo-Italian Cup final. Two years later, he led Sunderland to success in the 1973 FA Cup final, and followed it up with promotion from the Second Division in 1975–76.

==Playing career==

Born in Mickley, near Prudhoe, Northumberland, the son of a miner, Stokoe began his footballing career at Newcastle United, signing for them as an apprentice in 1947 and playing the first of 261 games, usually as centre-half, on Christmas Day 1950 against Middlesbrough, a game in which he also scored. The highlight of his 13 years at Newcastle was the 3–1 1955 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. After leaving Newcastle and joining Bury in February 1961, Stokoe spent a short time as a player, leading the team in an undefeated run to promotion, before making the move into management with the same club as player-manager the following season.

==Management career==

Stokoe took the post of player-manager at Bury in December 1961 which, at 31 years of age, made him the second-youngest manager in the Football League. He led them to the semi-finals of the League Cup in 1962–63. He retired from playing in 1964, staying on as manager for another year after which he moved south to take charge at Charlton Athletic from 1965 to 1967. He was manager of Rochdale from 1967 to 1968, followed by three separate spells at Carlisle United (1968–1970, 1980–1985 and 1985–1986).

===Blackpool===
Between spells at Carlisle, Stokoe managed Blackpool from 1970 to 1972. He was initially approached by the club in the summer of 1969, after the departure of Stan Mortensen. At the time, he declined, preferring to stay with Carlisle; just over eighteen months later, however, he became the ninth official manager in Blackpool&#x27;s history.

With Blackpool relegated to the Second Division before he took over, Stokoe began to clear out the &quot;deadwood&quot; and rebuilt the side more to his liking. Stokoe agreed to sell Tony Green to his old club, Newcastle, bringing striker Keith Dyson in the opposite direction.

Before the departure of Green, Blackpool enjoyed a successful venture into Europe, winning the Anglo-Italian Cup in June 1971. In the league, meanwhile, the Seasiders finished in sixth place. This still was not good enough for the fans, however, who became disenchanted with life outside the top flight again, and the club&#x27;s style of play under Stokoe was not to their liking.

Another successful run in the Anglo-Italian Cup the following season, when Blackpool finished as runners-up to Roma, kept the critics at bay, but the feeling around Bloomfield Road was that the 1972–73 campaign would be critical.

Stokoe&#x27;s third season at Blackpool started well enough when, with the team reasonably placed for a promotion push and having stated that he intended to remain at the club for five years, he left the club. He had been lured back to his native north-east by Sunderland.

===Sunderland===
Stokoe took over as manager of Sunderland on 29 November 1972 when they were fourth from bottom of the Second Division table after a run of just four wins in 18 games. Although his first game in charge was lost 1–0 at home to Burnley, the following week seemingly liberated players won 3–2 away at Portsmouth, starting a run of 32 games, with only five defeats. Just six months later, on 5 May 1973, having already beaten Manchester City and Arsenal on their way to the FA Cup final, Stokoe took the Second Division club to Wembley and defeated the cup holders Leeds United to secure Sunderland&#x27;s first FA Cup title since 1937. Managed by Don Revie, whom Stokoe had opposed when playing for Newcastle United in their 1955 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City, Leeds United were a team packed with international players and strong favourites to retain the trophy. However, Sunderland scored in the first half through Ian Porterfield and with the help of a memorable second-half match-saving double save from goalkeeper Jim Montgomery, managed to win 1–0. The victory was the first time a Second Division team had won the Cup in 42 years. Stokoe is remembered for his impromptu jubilant run down the pitch at the end of the game, complete in Mackintosh and his trilby hat, to celebrate the victory with Montgomery. A statue of Stokoe with his arms held aloft in celebratory mid-run now stands outside Sunderland&#x27;s Stadium of Light. None of the Sunderland players had been capped at the highest level when they lifted the cup, though some were capped later. Sunderland finished 6th in the Second Division that season and narrowly missed promotion in the following two seasons.

In 1975–76, he guided the club to the Second Division title. He tendered his resignation the following season after they struggled in the First Division with a start of nine straight games without a victory.

===Later years===
In May 1978, Stokoe returned to Blackpool with the club in dire straits. Under the management of Allan Brown they had been relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history and were looking for someone who could rebuild the club. He guided them to a mid-table finishing position, and then resigned again before the start of the 1979–80 season.

There followed another spell with Rochdale (1979–1980) which ended with the club having to seek re-election to the League and spells with Carlisle United (1980–1985 and 1985–1986). He led Carlisle to promotion to the Second Division in 1982, and in the 1983–84 season they became promotion contenders before a poor run saw them finish 7th. He resigned in 1985, only to be reappointed and resign again seven months later.

Towards the end of the 1986–87 season, he was appointed caretaker manager of Sunderland as they struggled in the Second Division. They narrowly lost on the away goals rule, in the end-of-season relegation-promotion playoffs and were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history. His contract was not renewed and he retired from football. During his whole career as a manager he was never sacked by any of his clubs.

==Death==

After being unwell for some time with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Stokoe was admitted to hospital in Hartlepool suffering from pneumonia and died on 1 February 2004 aged 73. The respect offered by both rival fan groups of Newcastle United and Sunderland was marked by their attendance at his funeral at the crematorium at Newcastle upon Tyne. The Reverend Neil Cockling, the Methodist Minister for Prudhoe, who conducted the service, told mourners: &quot;He will be remembered by all as a real gentleman. Such was Bob&#x27;s standing that we can see Sunderland and Newcastle here together today to celebrate his life.&quot;

<text>Pop-up ads or pop-ups are forms of online advertising on the World Wide Web. A pop-up is a graphical user interface (GUI) display area, usually a small window, that suddenly appears (&quot;pops up&quot;) in the foreground of the visual interface. The pop-up window containing an advertisement is usually generated by JavaScript that uses cross-site scripting (XSS), sometimes with a secondary payload that uses Adobe Flash. They can also be generated by other vulnerabilities/security holes in browser security.

A variation on the pop-up window, the pop-under advertisement, opens a new browser window under the active window. Pop-unders do not interrupt the user immediately but appear when the user closes the covering window, making it more challenging to determine which website created them.

==History==
Pop-up ads originated on the Tripod.com webpage hosting site in the late 1990s. JavaScript provided the capability for a web page to open another window. Ethan Zuckerman claims he used that capability to launch advertisements in separate windows as a response to complaints from advertisers about their ads appearing on pages with sexual content. Zuckerman later apologized for the unforeseen nuisance pop-up ads had evolved into.

Web development and design technologies allow an author to associate any item on a pop-up with any action, including with a cancel or innocent-looking button. Because of bad experiences and apprehensive of possible damage that they may cause, some users do not click on or interact with any item inside a pop-up window whatsoever, and may leave the site that generated them or block all pop-ups.

Opera was the first major browser to incorporate tools to block pop-up ads; the Mozilla browser later improved on this by blocking only pop-ups generated as the page loads. In the early 2000s, all major web browsers except Internet Explorer let users block unwanted pop-ups almost completely. In 2004, Microsoft released Windows XP SP2, which added pop-up blocking to Internet Explorer. Most modern browsers provide pop-up blocking tools; third-party tools add other features, such as ad filtering.

===Fake close buttons===
Users of websites and web applications continuously experience unwanted pop-up ads throughout the course of their normal interaction with a web browser. Ordinarily, users respond by dismissing the pop-up through the &quot;close&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot; feature of the window hosting the pop-up. Because this is a typical response, some authors of pop-up advertising depend on this and create on-screen buttons or controls that look similar to a &quot;close&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot; option. When the user chooses one of these &quot;simulated cancel&quot; options, the button performs an unexpected or unauthorized action (such as opening a &quot;new&quot; pop-up or downloading an unwanted file on the user&#x27;s system).

===Circumventing pop-up blockers===

A &quot;hover ad&quot; or &quot;in-page pop-up&quot; uses JavaScript to combine a banner ad, and a pop-up window that appears in front of the browser screen. JavaScript imposes an advertisement over a webpage in a transparent layer. This advertisement can appear in a variety of forms. For example, an advertisement can contain an animation that links to the advertiser&#x27;s site. An advertisement can also look like a normal window. Pop-up blockers cannot block the ad because it is a part of the webpage, but it can be blocked with third-party ad blockers such as AdBlock and Adblock Plus, or by using custom style sheets.

===URL redirection===
URLs are sometimes redirected to advertisement pages by URL redirection.

URLs are sometimes opened in a new tab and then the content of the old background tab will be replaced with an advertisement page by URL redirection, other times it switches the tab the user is on to the advertisement tab. Adblock Plus and NoScript cannot block these redirects.

==Techniques==

===&quot;Pop-ups&quot;===
* Certain types of downloaded content, such as images, free music, and others, can cause pop-ups, and therefore should not be trusted, especially pornographic sites&#x27; pop-ups (known as a &quot;pornado&quot; or &quot;porn-storm&quot;, as coined by John C. Dvorak.) Also, the pop-ups sometimes look like ordinary web pages, and the name of the site shows up in a search bar. 
* Many websites use pop-ups to display information without disrupting the page currently open. For example, they may provide needed extra guidance when filling in a form on a web page, without causing the loss of any information already entered into the form. Most pop-up blockers allow this kind of pop-up. Some, however, reload the page, losing any information the user entered.
* Some online shops use exit intent popups, for example offering discounts, in an attempt to retain users.
* Some web based installers, such as that used by McAfee, use a pop-up to install software.
* On many web browsers, holding down the ctrl key while clicking a link makes it bypass the popup filter. 
* Clicking (even accidentally) on one pop-up may open other pop-up ads.

===Pop-under ads===
Pop-under ads are similar to pop-up ads, but the ad window appears hidden behind the main browser window rather than superimposed in front of it. As pop-up ads became more widespread and intrusive, often taking up the whole computer screen, many users would immediately close the pop-up ads that appeared over a site without looking at them. Pop-under ads do not immediately impede the view of content, but remain unnoticed until the user closes or minimizes the main browser window. 

====Pop-under ad technology====
A pop-under ad involves two JavaScript functions introduced in 1995 with the Netscape 2.0b3 browser. Modern web publishers and advertisers use it to create a window in front of the user&#x27;s screen, load an advertisement, and then send it behind the screen.
// create a new window in front of the current site
window.open(URL, windowName[, windowFeatures]); 
// push the loaded advertisement back behind the browser
window.focus();
Most modern browsers allow codice_1 to execute only if it was called by a user interaction (e.g., a mouse click) event handler. Any non-interactive calls (timer callback, load events, etc.) to codice_1 result in the new window being blocked.

To bypass this restriction, most pop-under ads trigger on a mouse click event listener attached directly to the document or the document&#x27;s body. This enables catching all mouse click events that were not consumed by other click event handlers, and calling codice_1 without being blocked. For example, when the user selects a text, the mouse click triggers the mouse click handler attached to the document and a pop-under opens using the above code. Other techniques to bypass the codice_1 call restriction do so by &quot;hijacking&quot; mouse clicks.

===Hover ad===

Hover ads, more commonly called in-page pop-ups, are a special type of pop-up ads created using Dynamic HTML, JavaScript and similar web browser technologies. Because they do not scroll with the web page, they appear to &quot;hover&quot; over the page, usually obscuring the content. Hover ads tend to be very hard to block by pop-up blocking software, because the hover ad window is an integral part of the HTML content of the web page. Thus software filtering the content has no algorithmic means of recognizing and removing parts of
the content, either descriptive or procedural, that create, populate and manipulate the hover ad&#x27;s window.

== Patent controversy ==
ExitExchange.com filed for a patent in 2000 on a subset of pop-under advertising called an exit pop. After years of controversy and numerous articles on the pop-under patent, the patent was awarded by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in April and June 2008. The respective patent numbers are (&#x27;555) and (&#x27;229). &#x27;555 is related to the method of opening an exit pop from a toolbar or software application on a computing device, whereas &#x27;229 covers the method used to open an exit pop from an embedded script found within a media file (e.g., JavaScript code on a web page).

==Copyright issues==

Copyright aspects of pop-up advertising are discussed in the Wikipedia articles on derivative works and transformativeness. Both articles contain illustrations and links to examples of pop-up advertising.

<doc id="466322" wikidata="Q744385" url="?curid=466322" title="Temporal lobe">
<text>The temporal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.

The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association.
&quot;Temporal&quot; refers to the head&#x27;s temples.

== Structure ==

The temporal lobe consists of structures that are vital for declarative or long-term memory. Declarative (denotative) or explicit memory is conscious memory divided into semantic memory (facts) and episodic memory (events). 

The medial temporal lobe structures are critical for long-term memory, and include the hippocampal formation, perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal, and entorhinal neocortical regions. The hippocampus is critical for memory formation, and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage. The prefrontal and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory.

Research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function, whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment.

A form of epilepsy that involves the medial lobe is usually known as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

== Function ==

===Visual memories===
The temporal lobe communicates with the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of explicit long-term memory modulated by the amygdala.

===Processing sensory input===
;Auditory: Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior, and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. The temporal lobe is involved in primary auditory perception, such as hearing, and holds the primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex receives sensory information from the ears and secondary areas process the information into meaningful units such as speech and words. The superior temporal gyrus includes an area (within the lateral fissure) where auditory signals from the cochlea first reach the cerebral cortex and are processed by the primary auditory cortex in the left temporal lobe.

;Visual: The areas associated with vision in the temporal lobe interpret the meaning of visual stimuli and establish object recognition. The ventral part of the temporal cortices appears to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as faces (fusiform gyrus) and scenes (parahippocampal gyrus). Anterior parts of this ventral stream for visual processing are involved in object perception and recognition.

===Language recognition===
In humans, temporal lobe regions are critical for accessing the semantic meaning of spoken words, printed words, and visual objects. Wernicke&#x27;s area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes of the dominant cerebral hemisphere (the left, in the majority of cases), plays a key role (in tandem with Broca&#x27;s area in the frontal lobe) in language comprehension, whether spoken language or signed language. FMRI imaging shows these portions of the brain are activated by signed or spoken languages. These areas of the brain are active in children&#x27;s language acquisition whether accessed via hearing a spoken language, watching a signed language, or via hand-over-hand tactile versions of a signed language. 

The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, and verbal memory.

===New memories===

The medial temporal lobes (near the sagittal plane) are thought to be involved in encoding declarative long term memory. The medial temporal lobes include the hippocampi, which are essential for memory storage, therefore damage to this area can result in impairment in new memory formation leading to permanent or temporary anterograde amnesia.

==Clinical significance==

===Unilateral temporal lesion===
* Contralateral homonymous upper quadrantanopia (sector anopsia)
* Complex hallucinations (smell, sound, vision, memory)

===Dominant hemisphere===
* Receptive aphasia
** Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia
** Anomic aphasia
* Dyslexia
* Impaired verbal memory
* Word agnosia, word deafness

===Non-dominant hemisphere===
* Impaired non-verbal memory
* Impaired musical skills

===Bitemporal lesions (additional features)===
* Deafness
* Apathy (affective indifference)
* Impaired learning and memory 
* Amnesia, Korsakoff syndrome, Klüver–Bucy syndrome

===Damage===
Individuals who suffer from medial temporal lobe damage have a difficult time recalling visual stimuli. This neurotransmission deficit is not due to lacking perception of visual stimuli, but rather to the inability to interpret what is perceived. The most common symptom of inferior temporal lobe damage is visual agnosia, which involves impairment in the identification of familiar objects. Another less common type of inferior temporal lobe damage is prosopagnosia which is an impairment in the recognition of faces and distinction of unique individual facial features.

Damage specifically to the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe can cause savant syndrome.

===Disorders===
Pick&#x27;s disease, also known as &quot;frontotemporal amnesia&quot;, is caused by atrophy of the frontotemporal lobe. Emotional symptoms include mood changes, which the patient may be unaware of, including poor attention span and aggressive behavior towards themselves or others. Language symptoms include loss of speech, inability to read or write, loss of vocabulary and overall degeneration of motor ability.

Temporal lobe epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures; symptoms include a variety of sensory (visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustation) hallucinations, as well as an inability to process semantic and episodic memories.

Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by severe disorientation. Its most explicit symptom is the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations. The cause of such hallucinations has been attributed to deficits in the left temporal lobe, specifically within the primary auditory cortex. Decreased gray matter, among other cellular deficits, contribute to spontaneous neural activity that affects the primary auditory cortex as if it were experiencing acoustic auditory input. The misrepresentation of speech in the auditory cortex results in the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients. Structural and functional MRI techniques have accounted for this neural activity by testing affected and non-affected individuals with external auditory stimuli.

<doc id="466334" wikidata="Q2865153" url="?curid=466334" title="Arthur Bremer">
<text>Arthur Herman Bremer (; born August 21, 1950) is an American convicted criminal, who attempted to assassinate U.S. Democratic presidential candidate George Wallace on May 15, 1972, in Laurel, Maryland, leaving Wallace permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Bremer was found guilty and sentenced to 63 years (53 years after an appeal) in a Maryland prison for the shooting of Wallace and three bystanders. After 35 years of incarceration, Bremer was released from prison on November 9, 2007.

==Early life==
Bremer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the third of four sons, to William and Sylvia Bremer. He was raised by his working-class parents on the south side of Milwaukee and lived in a dysfunctional household. Bremer stated &quot;I would escape my ugly reality by pretending that I was living with a television family and there was no yelling at home or no one to hit me.&quot;

Though he played football with the freshman-sophomore team and tried out for the wrestling team during the 1966-67 school year, Bremer did not make friends, and he remained a solitary student until his 1969 graduation from South Division High School.

After graduating from high school, Bremer briefly attended Milwaukee Area Technical College, studying aerial photography, art, writing, and psychology; he dropped out after one semester.

== Life before assassination plots ==
Bremer was employed as a busboy at the Milwaukee Athletic Club from March 1969. In 1971, Bremer was demoted to kitchen work after customers complained that he talked to himself and that &quot;he whistled and marched in tune with music played in the dining room.&quot; Angered by his demotion, Bremer complained to the program planner for the Milwaukee Commission on Community Relations. The complaint was investigated and dismissed. Bremer quit his job at the Athletic Club on February 16, 1972.

On September 1, 1970, Bremer got a part-time job working as a janitor at Story Elementary School, which he quit after almost 18 months, on January 31, 1972.

On October 16, 1971, after an argument, Bremer moved from his parents&#x27; house to a three-room one-bedroom apartment near Marquette University, where he lived until May 9, 1972.

Late on the night of November 18, 1971, Bremer was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for parking in a no-parking zone. A court-appointed psychiatrist declared Bremer mentally ill, yet stable enough to continue to live in the community. Bremer was released after paying a $38.50 fine.

On December 8, 1971, Bremer pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct.

On January 13, 1972, Bremer went into the Casanova Gun Shop in Milwaukee, and bought a snub-nosed Charter Arms Undercover .38-caliber revolver for $90.

== Plans to assassinate Richard Nixon ==

After a short relationship ended and he quit both of his jobs, on March 1, 1972, Bremer began his &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Diary&quot; with the words &quot;It is my personal plan to assassinate by pistol either Richard Nixon or George Wallace. I intend to shoot one or the other while he attends a campaign rally for the Wisconsin Primary.&quot;

On April 10, Bremer traveled from Milwaukee to Ottawa, which Nixon was about to visit. Three days later, dressed in a business suit with a &quot;Vote Republican&quot; sticker on, wearing sunglasses and with a revolver in his pocket, Bremer went out intending to assassinate Nixon, but found no opportunity. Security was tight, making it impossible for Bremer to get close enough to Nixon, and he doubted whether any bullets would go through the glass of Nixon&#x27;s limousine.

Three days later, on April 13, Bremer thought he saw Nixon&#x27;s limousine outside of the Centre Block, but it had disappeared by the time he could retrieve his revolver from his hotel room.

== Plans to assassinate George Wallace ==
On May 4, 1972, after a ten-day break from writing, Bremer realized it would be almost impossible to assassinate Nixon and decided that it was Wallace&#x27;s &quot;fate&quot; to be his victim, even though his diary entries never showed the same level of interest or enthusiasm as they did with regard to assassinating Nixon. Bremer made this clear in his diary writing, &quot;He [Wallace] certainly won&#x27;t be buried with the snobs in Washington. ... I won&#x27;t even rate a TV interruption in Russia or/Europe when the news breaks—they never heard of Wallace.&quot; The following day, he checked out two books from the public library in Milwaukee, both detailing the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan: &quot;Sirhan&quot; by Aziz Shihab and &quot;R.F.K. Must Die!&quot; by Robert Blair Kaiser.

Despite his lack of enthusiasm, early on the morning of May 9, 1972, Bremer took a car ferry to Ludington, Michigan, and visited the Wallace campaign headquarters in Silver Lake, Michigan, and offered to be a volunteer. That week, he attended Wallace rallies in Lansing and Cadillac.

On the afternoon of May 13, Kalamazoo police received an anonymous phone call saying a suspicious looking person had been sitting in a car near the National Guard Armory. When questioned, Bremer said he was waiting for the Wallace rally to begin and wanted to get a good seat. Bremer was photographed at the rally that evening, where he had a clear opportunity to shoot his target, but according to his diary, he did not do so because he might have shattered some glass and blinded some &quot;stupid 15-year-olds&quot; who stood nearby.

The following day, Bremer set off for Maryland and made his final diary entry.

===Shooting===
Bremer turned up in Wheaton, Maryland for Wallace&#x27;s noon rally at the Wheaton Plaza shopping center on May 15, 1972. He was dressed in patriotic red, white, and blue, wearing his new campaign button that read &quot;Wallace in 1972&quot;, and dark sunglasses. He strongly applauded Wallace, in contrast with many others present, who heckled and taunted the speaker. Two tomatoes were thrown at Wallace during the rally, but both missed. Based on this reception, Wallace refused to shake hands with anyone present, denying Bremer the opportunity to carry out his plan.

At a second rally at Laurel Shopping Center, away in Laurel, Maryland, there was minor heckling, but it did not last. About 1,000 people were present; they were mostly quiet and it was generally a friendly crowd. After he had finished speaking, Wallace shook hands with some of those present, against the advice of his Secret Service guards. At approximately 4 p.m., Bremer pushed his way forward, aimed his .38 revolver at Wallace&#x27;s abdomen and opened fire, emptying the weapon before he could be subdued. He hit Wallace four times. Wallace fell back and lost a pint of blood, going into a mild state of shock. One bullet lodged in his spinal cord; the others hit Wallace in the abdomen and chest. Three others present were wounded unintentionally: State Trooper Captain E.C. Dothard, Wallace&#x27;s personal bodyguard, who was shot in the stomach; Dora Thompson, a campaign volunteer, who was shot in the leg; and Nick Zarvos, a Secret Service agent. Zarvos was shot in the neck, and his speech was severely impaired following the shooting.

Bremer had planned to yell his carefully chosen catchphrase, , as he shot Wallace. However, in the heat of the assassination attempt, he forgot to do so. A television cameraman captured footage of the shooting.

===Arrest===

After emptying his revolver, Bremer was wrestled to the ground and then arrested.

After searching Bremer&#x27;s car, police described it as a &quot;hotel on wheels&quot;. In it they found blankets, pillows, a blue steel 9 mm 13-shot Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic pistol, binoculars, a woman&#x27;s umbrella, a tape recorder, a portable radio with police band, an electric shaver, photographic equipment, a garment bag with several changes of clothes, a toilet kit, a 1972 copy of a &quot;Writers&#x27; Yearbook&quot;, and the two books he had borrowed from the Milwaukee public library ten days earlier. 

===Break-in plot ===
In a widely noted article, journalist Seymour Hersh claimed that secret recordings of Nixon prove that, within hours of the assassination attempt, the president and a top aide dispatched a political operative, E. Howard Hunt, to Milwaukee with plans to surreptitiously enter Bremer&#x27;s apartment and plant the campaign literature of Democratic contender George McGovern. According to Hersh, Hunt aborted the operation because the FBI had sealed off Bremer&#x27;s apartment prior to his arrival.

In his memoir, Hunt reports that the day after the assassination attempt he received a call from Chuck Colson, asking him to break into Bremer&#x27;s apartment and plant &quot;leftist literature to connect him to the Democrats&quot;. Hunt recalls that he was highly skeptical of the plan due to the apartment being guarded by the FBI but investigated the feasibility of it anyway at Colson&#x27;s insistence. G. Gordon Liddy also discusses the plan in his memoir.

===Trial and conviction===

Bremer&#x27;s trial in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was condensed to five days and began on July 31, 1972, only two and a half months after he had shot Wallace. The defense argued that Bremer had schizophrenia and was legally insane at the time of the shooting, and that he had &quot;no emotional capacity to understand anything.&quot; Arthur Marshall, for the prosecution, told the court that Bremer, while disturbed and in need of psychiatric help and treatment, knew what he was doing, had been seeking glory, and was still sorry that Wallace had not died.

Jonas Rappeport, the chief psychiatrist for the circuit court in Baltimore, who spent a total of nine hours with Bremer in June 1972 on four occasions, said Bremer had a &quot;schizoid personality disorder with some paranoid and psychopathic features&quot;, but also stated that this did not &quot;substantially impair his capacity to understand the criminality of his actions.&quot;

On August 4, 1972, the jury of six men and six women took 95 minutes to reach their verdict. Bremer was sentenced to 63 years in prison for shooting Wallace and three other people. When asked if he had anything to say, Bremer replied, &quot;Well, Mr. Marshall mentioned that he would like society to be protected from someone like me. Looking back on my life I would have liked it if society had protected me from myself. That&#x27;s all I have to say at this time.&quot; The sentence was reduced to 53 years on September 28, 1972, after an appeal. On July 6, 1973, Bremer&#x27;s second appeal to have the sentence reduced further was rejected.

===Aftermath===

Although Bremer&#x27;s actions, arrest, trial, and conviction attracted media and public attention, he soon faded into comparative obscurity. As he had predicted in May 1972, he did not reach the level of infamy of Lee Harvey Oswald or John Wilkes Booth, both of whom had assassinated presidents.

A 113-page portion of Bremer&#x27;s diary was published in 1973 as &quot;An Assassin&#x27;s Diary&quot;; it covers the period from April 4, 1972—which, coincidentally, was the day on which George McGovern won the Wisconsin primary—to the day before Bremer shot Wallace.

On August 26, 1980, an earlier part of Bremer&#x27;s diary, dated from March 1 to April 3, 1972, (pp. 1–148) was found where he had concealed it, heavily wrapped in a plastic suitcase at the foot of Milwaukee&#x27;s 27th Street viaduct. In it, Bremer discusses his desire to kill Nixon (Wallace was clearly a secondary target) and fantasizes about killing unnamed individuals who had angered him. He also imagines opening fire at random at the corner of 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue downtown. The diary was eventually sold to an official of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who donated it to UAB&#x27;s Reynolds Historical Library.

Bremer&#x27;s assassination attempt did not end Wallace&#x27;s political career. Wallace was subsequently elected governor of Alabama twice, in 1974 and 1982. However, the result of the assassination attempt, combined with changes in Wallace&#x27;s personal and general political circumstances, ended his presidential aspirations. Public concerns over Wallace&#x27;s health meant he would never gain the momentum he had in the 1972 campaign. He entered the presidential election race in 1976 but withdrew early due to lack of significant support.

Wallace forgave Bremer in August 1995 and wrote to him expressing the hope that the two could get to know each other better. Bremer did not reply. Wallace died on September 13, 1998.

==Sentence and release==

Bremer served his sentence at the Maryland Correctional Institution (MCI-H) in Hagerstown. He was placed in solitary confinement for 30 days after a fight on October 6, 1972. He was reprimanded after another fight in December 1972, and then placed in solitary again for 30 days after a third fight in February 1973. In prison, he declined to receive mental health treatment or evaluation. He worked in the prison library and was described by the chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, David Blumberg, as &quot;compliant and unobtrusive.&quot; He was visited multiple times by his parents before they died.

According to 1997 parole records, psychological testing indicated releasing him would be risky. He argued in his June 1996 hearing that &quot;[s]hooting segregationist dinosaurs wasn&#x27;t as bad as harming mainstream politicians.&quot; Bremer was released from prison on November 9, 2007, at the age of 57, having served 35 years of his original sentence. His probation ends in 2025.

Conditions of his release include electronic monitoring and staying away from elected officials and candidates. He must undergo a mental health evaluation and receive treatment if the state deems it necessary; he may not leave the state without written permission from the state agency that will supervise him until the end of his probation.

<doc id="466340" wikidata="Q276415" url="?curid=466340" title="A Cinderella Story">
<text>A Cinderella Story is a 2004 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Mark Rosman, written by Leigh Dunlap and starring Hilary Duff, Chad Michael Murray, Jennifer Coolidge, and Regina King. A modernization of the classic &quot;Cinderella&quot; folklore, the film&#x27;s plot revolves around two internet pen pals who plan to meet in person at their high school&#x27;s Halloween dance.

The film was released on July 16, 2004. While it was panned by critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $70.1 million against its $19 million budget, and inspired multiple straight-to-video films. Over the years, it has developed into a cult classic.

==Plot==
Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Montgomery is raised by her widowed father Hal, who runs a diner in the San Fernando Valley. Hal marries a vain and greedy woman named Fiona, who has twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. When Sam is 9 years old, Hal dies in the 1994 Northridge earthquake apparently without leaving a will, leading Fiona to inherit everything.

Eight years later, 17-year-old Sam is tormented by her stepfamily, while the community faces a drought. She and her best friend Carter Farrell, an aspiring actor, are bullied by the popular clique at school, led by head cheerleader and mean girl Shelby Cummings.

Forced to work at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, Sam is looked after by longtime manager Rhonda and confides in her online pen pal &quot;Nomad&quot;, who shares her dream to attend Princeton to become a writer. Unbeknownst to Sam, &quot;Nomad&quot; is Austin Ames, the popular but unhappy school quarterback and Shelby&#x27;s boyfriend, whose father Andy expects him to attend USC.

Sam agrees to meet &quot;Nomad&quot; at the school Halloween dance and Austin breaks up with Shelby, although Shelby refuses to believe him. Fiona refuses to give Sam the night off to attend the dance, but Rhonda and Carter intervene. Rhonda gives her a mask and her old wedding dress to wear as &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Dressed as &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, Austin reveals to Sam that he is &quot;Nomad&quot; but does not recognize her under her mask, and they share a romantic dance.

A masked Carter makes out with Shelby after defending her from the unwanted advances of Austin&#x27;s friend but is forced to drive Sam back to the diner before Fiona discovers she is gone. As they leave, Sam drops her cell phone, which is found by Austin, as he and the missing Cinderella are named homecoming prince and princess. The diner staff stalls Fiona and her daughters, and Sam arrives just in time.

The next day, Austin covers the school in flyers, hoping to identify the mysterious Cinderella and Carter is cruelly rejected by Shelby. Austin&#x27;s friends present him with a crowd of girls claiming to be Cinderella, without success. He is accepted to Princeton but unable to tell his father and visits the diner, where Sam tries to tell him the truth.

Brianna and Gabriella discover Sam&#x27;s emails with Austin, realizing she&#x27;s the mystery Cinderella. After failing to convince Austin that they are each Cinderella, the twins present the emails to Shelby, convincing her that Sam schemed to steal Austin away from her. At the school pep rally, Shelby and the twins perform a humiliating skit exposing Sam as Cinderella and she runs home crying.

Having intercepted Sam&#x27;s acceptance letter from Princeton, Fiona forges a rejection letter, further disheartening Sam. Rhonda encourages her not to lose hope and her stepsisters indirectly uncover a wallpapered-over mural of Hal&#x27;s motto. Inspired, Sam finally stands up to Fiona and quits the diner, leading Rhonda, the rest of the employees and even some of the customers to leave as well.

Moving in with Rhonda, Sam confronts Austin for being afraid to show who he really is, in the locker room just before the homecoming game. Seeing her leaving before the final play of the game, Austin stands up to his father and runs after Sam. He apologizes and they share their first kiss in the rain as the drought finally ends, much to the twins&#x27; and Shelby’s dismay.

Sam finds her father&#x27;s will hidden in her childhood fairytale book, revealing that everything was left to her, including the house and diner. As the rightful owner, Sam sells her stepfamily&#x27;s cars to pay for college, while Fiona claims to have never seen the will before, despite having signed it as a witness.

Arrested by the LAPD and D.A., she makes a deal with the latter to work her debt off at the diner, now co-owned by Rhonda; her daughters, after retrieving Sam&#x27;s acceptance letter from the trash, are also forced to work with her busing tables.

Andy accepts Austin&#x27;s decision to attend Princeton. Carter lands a commercial and rejects Shelby for Astrid, the school&#x27;s goth DJ and announcer. Austin returns Sam&#x27;s cell phone and they begin a relationship, driving off to Princeton together.

==Cast==
==Production==
Clifford Werber conceived a modernized adaptation of the Cinderella story due to its long-lasting appeal of being &quot;the ultimate wish-fulfillment fantasy&quot; with &quot;an underlying message of empowerment.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; premiered at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on July 10, 2004. It premiered in theaters with competition from other products that starred princesses or were fantasy-themed, such as &quot;The Prince &amp; Me&quot; (2004), &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004).

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An uninspired, generic updating of the classic fairy tale.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score on 25 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; &quot;is a lame, stupid movie, but Warner Bros. is spending a fortune to persuade [young audiences] to see it and recommend it&quot;. Other critics panned the plot as &quot;simple, lazy storytelling&quot; and &quot;a dull rehash of the old girl-meets-boy chestnut&quot;. They noted that its attempts to modernize aspects of the source material were gimmicky and led to illogical plot elements, such as a cell phone being the film&#x27;s glass slipper and Sam looking too pretty and cheerful for an outcast. Some particularly felt the use of a perfect teenager as a social reject delegitimized the moral of any average person believing in oneself.

The film was nominated for five Teen Choice Awards at the 2005 ceremony, winning the award for Choice Movie Blush Scene, the same year Duff won the Kids Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actress.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $13,623,350 in 2,625 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #4 at the box office, behind &quot;I, Robot&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;. By the end of its run, &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; grossed $51,438,175 domestically and $18,629,734 internationally, totaling $70,067,909 worldwide.

===Accolades===

The film won and was nominated for a number of awards throughout 2004–2005.
==Soundtrack==
==Film series==

&quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; was followed by five direct-to-video films, each presenting a separate modern-day version of the Cinderella story: The sequels use the themes and situations that also borrow from the Cinderella tale, but do not contain any characters from the first film. Unlike the first film, the sequels also include musical, dance and holiday event themes.

<text>Sveagruva (), or simply Svea, was a mining settlement in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, lying at the head of Van Mijenfjord.
When occupied by the workers, it was the third largest settlement in the archipelago (after Longyearbyen and Barentsburg) but there were no permanent inhabitants. Around 300 workers living in Longyearbyen commuted to Sveagruva for work on a daily or weekly basis. The mine was operated by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani. There is no road to Longyearbyen or any other settlements, so travel is done by air from Svea Airport and coal transport by ship from a port southwest. Sveagruva closed in 2020 and currently has no permanent inhabitants.

As of 2023, Sveagruva has been re-wilded to a pristine state. Almost every structure from its mining past has been removed in the largest operation of its kind.

==History==
The town was established in 1917 by Swedes. It was thereafter destroyed in 1944, but quickly re-established after World War II. The mining activity ceased in 1949, and was not re-established until 1970. Mining was suspended for a short period in 1987. In the 1990s, the town nearly vanished, as mines in Longyearbyen proved more productive and accessible. In 2005, a mine fire erupted, lasting uninterrupted for more than five weeks, and causing 700 million Norwegian kroner worth of damage.

Sveagruva held the most productive coal mine of Svalbard, the Svea Nord longwall mine. Opened in 2001, the mine produced up to 4 million metric tons of coal annually, making it one of the largest underground coal mines in Europe. The mine closed in March 2020.

<text>The Socialist Party () is a political party in Ireland, active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Internationally, it was affiliated to the Trotskyist International Socialist Alternative (previously the Committee for a Workers International) until 2024. 

The party has been involved in various populist campaigns including the Anti-Bin Tax Campaign and the Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes. Members of the party were jailed for their part in the former, while members have been arrested for their role in the latter. It had a seat in the European Parliament from 2009 to 2014. In 2015, the party received state funding of €132,000.

From 2014, the party&#x27;s election candidates in the Republic did not stand for election directly on the Socialist Party platform, but have instead run as candidates of the Anti-Austerity Alliance (AAA), now Solidarity, which was a registered party in its own right between 2014 and 2015 and which continues to contest elections as part of People Before Profit–Solidarity (PBP–S). Socialist Party members Ruth Coppinger, Mick Barry and former member Paul Murphy, were elected in this way as TDs in the 32nd Dáil. Similarly, in 2016 the Socialist Party in Northern Ireland instead fielded candidates in the Cross-Community Labour Alternative. In 2022, however, the party ran once again in the North as the Socialist Party.

==History==
The party was formed by former members of the Labour Party, collectively known as the Militant Tendency, who were expelled in 1989 having been accused of Trotskyist entryism. 

The Irish Militant Tendency was aligned with Militant tendency in Britain, with both groups having been founding members of the Committee for a Workers International in 1974.

After its expulsion from Labour, they formed Militant Labour, which became the Socialist Party in 1996.

===Foundation and Split from the Labour Party===
Militant Tendency in Ireland began in 1969 when Paul Jones, an Irish student who had joined Militant in Britain while he was a student in London, returned to Derry and began organising there, and also held meetings in Dublin. Peter Hadden, had similarly joined Militant when attending Sussex University in England and upon returning to Northern Ireland in 1971, began organising Militant there. The group grew on both sides of the border and practiced entrism in both the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the Labour Party in the Republic of Ireland. In 1977, they were expelled from the NILP and formed the Labour and Trade Union Group to contest elections in the north.

The party was formally founded in the south in 1972 as a tendency within the Irish Labour Party, grouped around the newsletter &quot;Militant Irish Monthly&quot;. The tendency organised within the Labour Party throughout the 1970s and 1980s, attempting to win the party towards socialism, and briefly controlled Labour Youth from 1983 to 1986. People associated with it include Dermot Connolly, Clare Daly, Finn Geaney, Joe Higgins and John Throne. In the late 1980s, a number of known members were expelled from Labour. In 1989 they established an independent party, adopting the title Militant Labour—also used by other sections of the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International at the time. In 1996 the party merged fully with the Labour and Trade Union Group of Northern Ireland and changed its name to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party has built some electoral support in the Republic of Ireland. It found it harder to gain an electoral foothold in Northern Ireland, but it has maintained a minor presence in the trade union movement there, as well as a youth wing.

===1996–2002 (27th and 28th Dáil)===
Militant Labour was renamed the Socialist Party in 1996, and came to wider attention among the general public when Joe Higgins polled just 252 votes behind victor Brian Lenihan Jnr in the Dublin-West by-election of that same year. In the general election of the following year, Higgins was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time.

===2002–2007 (29th Dáil)===

At the 2002 general election, Joe Higgins retained his Dublin West seat in Dáil Éireann. Clare Daly narrowly missed out on gaining a second seat for the party in the Dublin North constituency.

The Anti-Bin Tax Campaign came about at this time. On 19 September 2003, Higgins and Daly were sent to Mountjoy Prison for a month after refusing to abide by a High Court injunction relating to the blockading of bin lorries.

At the 2004 local elections, the Socialist Party gained two council seats, with Mick Murphy being elected to South Dublin County Council and Mick Barry being elected to Cork City Council. The party also retained their two previous seats (held by Daly and Ruth Coppinger) on Fingal County Council. At the European election held on the same day, Joe Higgins received 23,218 (5.5%) votes in the Dublin constituency, but did not win a seat.

Councillor Mick Murphy was responsible for bringing the GAMA construction scandal to light in October 2004. This involved a group of Turkish workers being brought to Ireland by GAMA, a Turkish construction company. They were illegally underpaid and forced to work hours in breach of the EU Working Time Directive. Murphy discovered the workers living on the building site where they were employed. After contacting the local council, GAMA and trade union officials and remaining unenlightened, Murphy wrote a leaflet in English, had it translated into Turkish &quot;mainly to say that we had no problem with them being here, and saying what GAMA had said&quot;, then threw it over the hoarding surrounding the site. Murphy brought it to the attention of his party colleague Joe Higgins, who was then a TD for Dublin West, and Higgins raised the matter in Dáil Éireann on 8 February 2005, bringing public awareness to the workers&#x27; plight. The exploitation included migrant Turkish construction workers being employed on state projects, being paid as little as €2.20 an hour (the minimum wage in Ireland was €7.00) while being forced to work up to 80 hours per week. This led to a strike by immigrant workers in Ireland. The exploited workers each won tens of thousand of euro worth of unpaid wages and overtime.

===2007–2011 (30th Dáil)===
At the 2007 general election, Joe Higgins lost his Dublin West seat and the Socialist Party was left without a TD for the first time since 1997. The Party campaigned for a &quot;no&quot; vote the 2008 and 2009 referendums on the Treaty of Lisbon.

At the 2009 European and local elections, Joe Higgins won a seat in the Dublin constituency with 50,510 (12.4%) first preference votes, as well as gaining a seat in the Castleknock local electoral area of Fingal County Council. The party held its seats on Fingal County and Cork City Council (Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry respectively), while gaining one seat each on Balbriggan Town Council and Drogheda Borough Council. However, the party lost Mick Murphy, its only councillor on South Dublin County Council.

===2011–2016 (31st Dáil)===
At the 2011 general election the Socialist Party returned two TDs to Dáil Éireann: Clare Daly was elected for the Dublin North constituency, while Joe Higgins regained his seat in Dublin West. The Socialist Party contested this election as part of the United Left Alliance (ULA), an alliance of far-left parties which included both People Before Profit (PBP) and Workers and Unemployed Action Group (WUAG), as well as independent activists. The Alliance won five seats in the national parliament. Higgins resigned his European Parliament seat, and Paul Murphy was selected by the party to replace him. Following the death of Brian Lenihan Jnr, the Socialist Party contested the 2011 Dublin West by-election, with its candidate Ruth Coppinger coming in third. The Socialist Party also called for a referendum on the December 2011 EU deal, which it opposed.

In 2012, legal advice was sought when it emerged that the expenses given to Higgins and Daly as TDs may have been used for travel outside their constituencies and journeys to the Dáil. Public expenditure minister Brendan Howlin subsequently confirmed that TDs were, in fact, entitled to claim expenses for travel outside their constituencies and that Daly and Higgins were guilty of no wrongdoing. The Socialist Party and ULA said the story was a &quot;manufactured controversy&quot;, part of a &quot;vindictive smear campaign by Independent Newspapers&quot;, which were owned by billionaire Denis O&#x27;Brien.

Clare Daly resigned from the Socialist Party in August 2012, following a dispute over her support of Independent TD Mick Wallace, whom the party had called on to resign after the revelation of tax irregularities. The Socialist Party left the ULA in January 2013.

Socialist Party members contested the 2014 local elections as part of the Anti-Austerity Alliance. The party gained seats on Limerick and Cork City Councils, making it &quot;a national rather than Dublin-centric alliance&quot;. The Dublin West by-election of the same day returned Ruth Coppinger to Dáil Éireann, giving Dublin West two Socialist Party TDs. Paul Murphy was unsuccessful in retaining the Socialist Party&#x27;s European seat at this time but was elected to Dáil Éireann that October after a surprise victory in the Dublin South-West by-election, which the Sinn Féin candidate had been favourite to win.

The party altered its registered name in 2014 to Stop the Water Tax – Socialist Party. In 2015, water charge protestors, including party elected representatives Paul Murphy, Kieran Mahon and Mick Murphy, were arrested. The arrests led to accusations of &quot;political policing&quot; and sparked minor solidarity protests across Europe, including in London, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm.

===2016–2020 (32nd Dáil)===

In the 2016 general election Murphy and Coppinger were re-elected in Dublin South-West and Dublin West, respectively, and Barry was elected in Cork North-Central, all of them running as Anti-Austerity Alliance–People Before Profit members.
&lt;br&gt;For the 2016 Assembly Election, the Socialist Party in Northern Ireland supported Cross-Community Labour Alternative and critically called for a vote for the People Before Profit as the two parties did not stand candidates in the same constituencies.

In 2019, divisions in the party resulting from a split in the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International led to Paul Murphy TD leaving to form RISE. The split separately led to the formation of Militant Left, which aligned with the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International (Refounded), a body predominantly supported by the Socialist Party of England and Wales.

===2020–2024 (33rd Dáil)===
In the 2020 general election, Mick Barry was re-elected in Cork North-Central but Ruth Coppinger lost her seat in Dublin West.

In July 2024, the Socialist Party voted to disaffiliate from the International Socialist Alternative.

===2024–present (34th Dáil)===
In the 2024 general election, Ruth Coppinger was once again elected in Dublin West, while Mick Barry narrowly lost his seat in Cork North-Central to Eoghan Kenny of Labour.

==Policies==
According to its website, the Socialist Party &quot;stands for the socialist alternative to the dictatorship of the markets – namely real democracy whereby ordinary people take centre stage in running society, with democratic public ownership of banks, of key sectors of the economy and industry, and a democratic plan of the economy to provide for the needs of people&quot;. It opposes the so-called &quot;Social Partnership&quot; deals and those in the trade union movement who advocate them, considering the agreements detrimental to the well-being of workers. It also holds influence in the Northern Irish branch of the FBU, where its members played a key role in encouraging the FBU&#x27;s split from the British Labour Party in 2004, as well as influence in NIPSA with members in the NIPSA Broad Left faction.

The Socialist Party is Eurosceptic and supported Brexit, considering the EU to be a &quot;club of bosses and bankers&quot; and rejecting reform attempts due to there being &quot;almost no mechanisms of democratic accountability&quot; in the EU.

The Socialist Party opposes sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics and seeks to bring working class unity to both sides of the border. They argue that capitalism is incapable of overcoming sectarianism. The Socialist Party take a critical view of the Good Friday Agreement and other subsequent initiatives, claiming it further entrenches and institutionalises sectarianism and doesn&#x27;t work towards solving the fundamental causes of the conflict. They therefore oppose a border poll and believe calling one would further polarise Catholic and Protestant communities. Instead, the Socialist Party believes that Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales should merge and form a socialist federation, which should aspire to be part of a Socialist Federation of Europe. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; has opined that the Socialist Party&#x27;s position is a &quot;bizarre fusion of Trotskyism and British Unionism&quot; that &quot;articulates a unionist outlook dressed in socialist rhetoric&quot;.

The Socialist Party is pro-choice. Their members staged an &#x27;abortion pill bus&#x27; during the campaign to repeal the 8th, where they travelled across Ireland distributing abortion pills.

The elected representatives of the Socialist Party observe a pay cap, donating the portion of their salaries that exceed the &quot;average industrial wage&quot; to the party and other leftist causes.

<text>Heide Simonis (; 4 July 1943 – 12 July 2023) was a German author and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). She was minister of finance in Schleswig-Holstein from 1988 until 1993, when she became minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein. She was the first woman to serve as head of a state government in German history and the only woman to do so in the 20th century, serving until 2005. As of September 2023, she is also the longest serving former female minister-president of a German state (11 years, 343 days).

== Early life and education ==
Born Heide Steinhardt in Bonn on 4 July 1943, she was the oldest of three sisters. She had asthma as a young child and therefore spent time in children&#x27;s homes from age three. She completed school with the &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1962 in Nürnberg. She then studied economics and sociology at the universities of Erlangen-Nürnberg and Kiel, graduating with a degree in economics in 1967. She worked in different positions after 1967, beginning as a lecturer at the University of Lusaka in Zambia. She worked with her husband for an advisory panel of the WHO in Japan on health development. She later worked as vocational counsellor at the employment office of Kiel.

== Career ==
=== National politics ===
Simonis joined the SPD in 1969. She was elected to the German Bundestag in 1976, representing the Rendsburg-Eckernförde district, as then the youngest member of the parliament.

=== State politics ===

In 1988, Simonis was appointed minister of finance in Schleswig-Holstein by minister-president Björn Engholm. In the 1992 state elections, she became a member of the legislature of Schleswig-Holstein. 

On 19 May 1993, Simonis was elected minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein after her predecessor Engholm resigned due to a scandal. She was the first woman in Germany to rise to this level in government. For her first cabinet, she kept almost all of Engholm&#x27;s ministers.

The 1996 state elections saw the SPD representation drop to 39.8% from 46.2% in 1992, but Simonis was able to form a coalition with the Greens. In the 2000 state elections, at the height of a Christian Democratic Union&#x27;s donations scandal, the SPD was able to increase its share to 43.1%. At the time, the result was also seen as marking a victory for Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who had campaigned ardently in support of Simonis.

Despite basing its campaign for the 2005 elections on Simonis&#x27; popularity, the SPD suffered a heavy defeat due to the bad economic situation and its support dropped to 38.7% (for the first time in almost twenty years behind the CDU). On 17 March 2005, Simonis failed to be re-elected as minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein in four consecutive ballots by the Schleswig-Holstein Landtag. In the first ballot she received 34 votes and Peter Harry Carstensen (CDU) received 33, while two deputies cast empty votes. Neither Simonis nor Carstensen got the absolute majority (35 votes). In the second and third ballots the candidates received 34 votes each, while one deputy of the alliance of SPD, Greens, and SSW abstained. An unprecedented fourth ballot brought the same result and Simonis stepped down as minister-president of Schleswig-Holstein.

=== After politics ===
Simonis served as chairwoman of the German Committee for UNICEF from 2005 until February 2008. She resigned from this position due to a scandal related to donations to the organisation that arose during her term.

== Personal life and legacy ==

In 1967, Simonis married who had studied with her. He became a professor of economics, with a focus on the environment. Among her hobbies was quiltmaking.

Simonis survived breast cancer. She announced in 2014 that she was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She died at home in Kiel on 12 July 2023, at age 80.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier described her as an exceptional political personality who shaped democracy beyond Schleswig-Holstein. He noted her competence, but also humanity and empathy.

<doc id="466391" wikidata="Q345373" url="?curid=466391" title="Bob Klose">
<text>Rado Robert Garcia Klose (born 1945) is an English musician, photographer and printmaker. Between 1964 and July 1965, he was the lead guitarist of the rock band the Tea Set, an early incarnation of Pink Floyd. Although he recorded a few songs with that band, he left before their transformation into Pink Floyd. However, on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page, he has been repeatedly mentioned when discussing the band and their tenure as the Tea Set.

== Name confusion ==
Klose&#x27;s full birth name is most often cited as Rado Robert Klose or Rado Robert Garcia Klose, with some authors citing Radovan as his full given name. During the 1960s he was commonly known as Bob Klose, which was often misspelt Bob Close or occasionally even Brian Close. On the official Pink Floyd website, he is listed as Klose, Radovan &#x27;Bob&#x27;.

== Biography ==
Klose was born in 1945 in Cambridge. His father was a refugee from Nazi Germany and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, and his mother was an English Land Girl. Due to their poor financial situation, the family lived in a field tent on a farm where Klose&#x27;s father worked for a couple of years until moving to a small Cambridgeshire village.

After several village schools, Klose attended school in Cambridge, where he met Syd Barrett and Roger Waters. He later moved to London to study architecture and then science at the Regent Street Polytechnic, before abandoning studies to completely devote himself to photography in the late 1960s.

=== Early musical career ===
During his architectural studies, Klose started playing lead guitar in a band with Roger Waters (guitar), Richard Wright (rhythm guitar), Nick Mason (drums), Clive Metcalfe (bass guitar), and Keith Noble and Juliette Gale (vocals). The band performed rhythm and blues under various names (&quot;Sigma 6&quot;, &quot;the Meggadeaths&quot;, &quot;the Abdabs&quot;, and &quot;the Screaming Abdabs&quot;), during their run with manager Ken Chapman, who also wrote some early material for the band.

Metcalfe, Noble and Gale left the band (though Gale would go on to marry Richard Wright). By the time they left, the line-up included Syd Barrett (rhythm guitar and vocals) and Bob Klose (lead guitar and vocals), with Roger Waters on bass and vocals, Richard Wright on organ and vocals and Nick Mason on drums. This new group used various names, often fluctuating between &quot;Tea Set&quot; and &quot;the Pink Floyd Sound&quot; (named after two old Carolina bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). The word &quot;Sound&quot; was dropped from the band&#x27;s name, with the definite article disappearing a few years later.

Klose was more focused on his studies than on the band and was more interested in jazz and blues than Barrett&#x27;s psychedelia and pop, so he left the band sometime around July 1965. Barrett assumed lead guitar, lead vocals, and the bulk of the songwriting, while Klose went on to become a photographer and print maker.

=== Later years ===
Klose confirmed in John Edginton&#x27;s BBC documentary &quot;The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story&quot; (2001) that his guitar can be heard on the unreleased early acetate single &quot;Lucy Leave&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m a King Bee&quot;. In the documentary he also talked about Syd Barrett: &quot;If you had said to a young Syd, &#x27;Look, this is your bargain in life, you know, you&#x27;re going to do this fantastic stuff, but it won&#x27;t be forever, it&#x27;ll be this short period. There&#x27;s the dotted line, are you going to sign for this?&#x27; I suspect, maybe, a lot of people would sign for that, for making their mark.&quot; The two songs were eventually released, with Klose credited as &quot;Rado Klose&quot;, in &quot;1965: Their First Recordings&quot; (2015)

In 2006, Klose wrote an accompanying essay for a picture book of previously unpublished Rowland Hilder&#x27;s watercolour paintings, entitled &quot;Rowland Hilder&#x27;s British Isles&quot;.

Klose appeared as a guest performer on David Gilmour&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;On an Island&quot; (credited as &quot;Rado Klose&quot; rather than his former professional name &quot;Bob Klose&quot;). The same year, he appeared on Paul &quot;Mudd&quot; Murphy&#x27;s album &quot;Claremont 56&quot;, as well as Chico Hamilton&#x27;s album &quot;Juniflip&quot;, on which he is also listed as a co-writer of one of the songs (&quot;Kerry&#x27;s Caravan&quot;). On both of these albums, he is credited as &quot;Bob Klose&quot;.

In 2007, he took part in BBC Radio 2&#x27;s programme &quot;Days in the Life&quot;, which was dedicated to Pink Floyd. In the first part of this show, he spoke about early days with Barrett.

He also played on &quot;Blue River&quot;, a 2007 electronic album by Smith &amp; Mudd, a collaboration between Paul &quot;Mudd&quot; Murphy and multi-instrumentalist/producer Benjamin James Smith. 

In 2015, Klose appeared as a guitarist on David Gilmour&#x27;s album &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot;.

<text>John Kerr FRS (; 17 December 1824 – 15 August 1907) was a Scottish physicist and a pioneer in the field of electro-optics. He is best known for the discovery of what is now called the Kerr effect.

==Life and work==

John Kerr was born on 17 December 1824 in Ardrossan, Scotland. He was a student in Glasgow from 1841 to 1846, and at the Theological College of the Free Church of Scotland, in Edinburgh, in 1849. Starting in 1857 he was a mathematical lecturer at the Free Church Training College in Glasgow. He died in Glasgow in 1907.

Kerr&#x27;s most important experimental work was the discovery of double refraction in solid and liquid dielectrics in an electrostatic field (1875) which is now known as the Kerr effect. In the Kerr effect, the difference between refractive index experienced by an ordinary and extraordinary ray is proportional to the square of the electric field. Where the relationship is linear, the effect is known as the Pockels effect. Intense light from lasers allows the achievement of the effect using the light&#x27;s own electric field, the &quot;AC Kerr effect&quot;. Kerr also demonstrated a similar phenomenon for magnetic fields, and it is now called the magneto-optic Kerr effect.

The Kerr effect is exploited in the &quot;Kerr cell&quot;, which is used in applications such as shutters in high-speed photography, with shutter-speeds as fast as 100 ns. In 1928 Karolus &amp; Mittelstaedt used a Kerr cell to modulate a beam of light to measure its speed. Earlier measurements had used mechanical means of modulation achieving frequencies of around 10 kHz, but the Kerr cell allows frequencies of 10 MHz and greater precision of measurement. Kerr&#x27;s original cell was a glass block. Modern cells are more commonly filled with liquids such as nitrobenzene.

Kerr also was an early champion of the metric system in the UK.

<doc id="466404" wikidata="Q10752167" url="?curid=466404" title="Cream of Wheat">
<text>Cream of Wheat is an American brand of farina, a type of breakfast porridge mix made from wheat middlings. It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota and debuted at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

The rice-based [[Cream of Rice]] also forms part of the product line, and is often a recommended early food for infants and toddlers and for people who cannot tolerate wheat or gluten.

Cream of Wheat was owned by Nabisco from 1961 to 2000 when Nabisco was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. B&amp;G Foods acquired the Cream of Wheat and Cream of Rice brands from Kraft in January 2007.

== History ==


After the Panic of 1893, the Diamond Milling Company in Grand Forks was faced with low prices and reduced demand for flour. Diamond&#x27;s Scottish-born chief miller, Tom Amidon, proposed that the company package a breakfast porridge that his wife would make from the portion of the wheat not used in making flour. This was made from the &quot;middlings&quot; of the wheat, a protein rich part of the wheat berry.

After initially being uninterested, Diamond&#x27;s owners — Emery Mapes, George Bull, and George Clifford — eventually agreed to test the product. They sent 10 cases, in strawboard boxes handmade by Amidon, to their brokers in New York along with a regular shipment of flour. Another employee suggested the name &quot;Cream of Wheat&quot; which was hand-lettered on the boxes along with a stock illustration of a black chef holding a saucepan which Mapes, a former printer, had on hand. Just hours after the brokers, Lamont, Corliss &amp; Co., distributed the product to grocers they wired Diamond ordering another 50 cases. The next morning, the brokers sent a second telegram saying, &quot;FORGET THE FLOUR. SEND US A CAR OF CREAM OF WHEAT.&quot;

Diamond directed its factory to begin manufacturing only Cream of Wheat. As demand increased, the company moved to a new factory in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1897, and changed its name to The Cream of Wheat Company. Six years later, the company outgrew its first Minneapolis plant and moved to a new location in the city. This was replaced by a third facility in 1927 where production remained for decades. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1929.

While the original variety continued to be produced, the company introduced &quot;Enriched Quick Cream of Wheat&quot; in 1939 which cooked more quickly, minutes vs. 10 minutes, and had added vitamins and minerals. This was followed in 1958 with &quot;Instant Cream of Wheat&quot; which cooked in 30 seconds. In 1961, Cream of Wheat was acquired by the National Biscuit Co. (later renamed Nabisco) for .

Philip Morris Companies acquired Nabisco and with it Cream of Wheat in 2000 and merged it with its Kraft Foods subsidiary. Kraft closed Cream of Wheat&#x27;s Minnesota plant in 2002, relocating production to other Kraft facilities. In 2007, Cream of Wheat was acquired from Kraft by B&amp;G Foods for approximately .

== Cream of Rice ==

Despite the many similarities between the products, Cream of Rice had an entirely separate origin and history to Cream of Wheat prior to 1983 when they were united under Nabisco.

The Cream of Rice Company, a Delaware corporation based in Chicago, was incorporated by T. C. Fredrich, O. C. Wilson, and Howard D. Stewart in October 1915. Frank O. Balch, the company&#x27;s secretary and treasurer, filed a trademark application for the &quot;Cream of Rice&quot; logo in December 1915. The trademark was registered in 1917. The company reported strong sales initially and market penetration of over half of retail stores in Chicago by February 1916. However, the company was liquidated by court order in 1921. A new company, the American Rice Products Company, was founded in 1921 in New Orleans by a group of investors from Chicago to take over the assets and &quot;Cream of Rice&quot; brand from the failed business.

The brand was acquired in 1937 by Grocery Store Products Company and initially produced in New Orleans. In 1949, production moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania. An attempt by Kraft to acquire Grocery Store Products in 1970 was called off due to objections by the Federal Trade Commission. In 1971 when Grocery Store Products was acquired by Clorox, Cream of Rice went with it but kept its West Chester plant. In 1983, Clorox sold the poorly performing Cream of Rice to Nabisco which already owned Cream of Wheat. Production of both brands was consolidated to the Cream of Wheat manufacturing facilities in Minneapolis after they were acquired along with Nabisco by Kraft.

== Preparation ==

Cream of Wheat is prepared from the box by boiling water or milk, then pouring in the farina while stirring. As it is stirred, the farina starts to thicken. The use of milk instead of (or in addition to) water gives the dish a creamier taste.

In the United States market, there are three unflavored mixes available (10-minute, -minute and 1-minute). In the Canadian market, there are two unflavored mixes available (8-minute and 3-minute).

Cream of Wheat is also sold in an instant format which includes the use of single-serving packets. These are prepared by simply mixing their contents with hot water and allowing the result to set in a bowl for approximately two minutes.

It is common to customize the hot cereal with the addition of sugar, fruit, or nuts. As a result, several flavors are sold of the instant variety: Original, Apples &#x27;N&#x27; Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Strawberries &#x27;N&#x27; Cream, and Cinnamon Swirl. In October 2012, Cream of Wheat added a new chocolate flavor to their instant line and later introduced a Bananas &amp; Cream flavor.

== Package design and controversy ==

The original boxes of Cream of Wheat were handmade and lettered, and were emblazoned with the image of an African American chef produced by Emery Mapes, one of Diamond Milling Company&#x27;s owners. The character was named Rastus and was developed by artist Edward V. Brewer. Rastus was included on all boxes and advertisements. It has long been thought that a chef named Frank L. White was the model for the chef shown on the Cream of Wheat box, a claim White himself made. White&#x27;s headstone contains his name and an etching taken from the man depicted on the Cream of Wheat box.

Leading up to 2020, there had been public pressure aimed at various companies to change branding with perceived racist origins, such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben&#x27;s. The character of Rastus had once been depicted as a cook who was barely literate and did not know about vitamins. &quot;Rastus&quot; is also a derogatory term traditionally associated with African Americans in the United States. For these reasons, B&amp;G Foods had been under public pressure for years to make changes.

Public demands to remove symbols of racism increased during the 2020 protests around racism. In response, on June 17, 2020, B&amp;G Foods announced that it was &quot;initiating an immediate review of the Cream of Wheat brand packaging&quot;. On September 25, 2020, the company announced that it was removing the chef&#x27;s image from all Cream of Wheat packaging.

== Marketing ==
Famous illustrators such as N. C. Wyeth, J. C. Leyendecker, and Henry Hutt all created ads for the Cream of Wheat brand.

<text>Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a trademarked proprietary treatment program for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), based on the belief that the development of dynamic intelligence is the key to improving the quality of life for autistic people. The program&#x27;s core philosophy is that autistic people can participate in authentic emotional relationships if they are exposed to them in a gradual, systematic way. The goal of treatment is to systematically build up the motivation and tools for successfully interacting in social relationships, to correct deficits in this area that are thought to be common to all autistic people.

RDI focuses on cultivating the building blocks of social connection—such as referencing, emotion sharing, coregulation, and experience sharing—that normally develop in infancy and early childhood. RDI is a family-based program, where trained consultants support families to alter their interaction and communication styles. There is a period of parent education, followed by an assessment of both the child and the child-parent relationship. After that consultants support the family through a set of specific objectives to build a &quot;guided participation&quot; relationship between parents and child that will allow the child to once again become a &quot;cognitive apprentice&quot; to the parents. Once the cognitive apprenticeship is in place, the family can move on to specific cognitive remediation objectives for the child. These are developmentally staged objectives designed to restore optimal neural connectivity through a series of &quot;discoveries&quot; and &quot;elaborations&quot;.

After four years, the RDI Program has evolved into RDIconnect, a company with a series of programs not only for autistics, but for other populations as well. Along with a Consultant Training program, RDIConnect now offers the Family Guided Participation Program, Dynamic Education Program and the RDI Program for ASD, each accompanied by tools that help organize, expedite and create a continuous dialogue between professional and parent. RDIConnect now applies the quality assurance, level of treatment and training that has been central to their internationally known program and to a new audience.

The RDI program was developed by the psychologist Steven Gutstein in the 1990s. Gutstein studied the means by which typical children become competent in the world of emotional relationships. He looked at the research in developmental psychology and found that early parent-infant interaction predicted later abilities in language, thinking and social development. Two books of RDI-based activities as well as a book explaining the background ideas were published in 2002, but RDI has changed significantly since then and is now only available through the RDI_LS, or learning system, accessed by trained consultants. 

There are now trained consultants in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, India, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, and Switzerland.

Latest publications by Dr. Steven Gutstein are: &quot;My Baby Can Dance - Stories of Autism, Asperger&#x27;s and Success through the Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) Program&quot; (2005), &quot;The Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) Program and Education&quot; (2007), and &quot;The RDI Book - Forging New Pathways for Autism, Asperger&#x27;s and PDD with the Relationship Development Intervention Program&quot; (2009).

==Major ideas==

RDI is based on the idea that &quot;dynamic intelligence&quot; must be enhanced for autistic children to develop typical behaviors. Dynamic Intelligence means being able to think flexibly, take different perspectives, cope with change, and process information simultaneously (e.g. listen and look at the same time). These abilities are essential in the real world.

Neural underconnectivity in autistic people leads to a rigid and static view of the world. Because of this dislike of change and inability to cope with new information, autistic people do not develop dynamic intelligence which is essential for relationships, independence and quality of life.

Typical children develop dynamic intelligence through guided participation, that is being guided and given challenges by their caregivers. Due to their social difficulties, this relationship breaks down in autistic children and so families must be supported to re-build it, in a slow and more deliberate manner. Children need to learn to reference their parents, share emotions and use experience-sharing language to build a close and trusting relationship where they can learn and cope with the uncertainty of life.

The six objectives of RDI are to improve the following:
* Emotional referencing: learning from the subjective and emotional experiences of others
* Social coordination: controlling behavior and observing others to enable participation in social relationships
* Declarative language: using language and non-verbal communication to interact with others
* Flexible thinking: adapting and altering plans when circumstances change
* Relational information processing: placing things in context and solving problems lacking clear solutions
* Foresight and hindsight: anticipating future possibilities based on past experiences

==Effectiveness==
While the Connections Center has conducted two studies into RDI, there have been as yet no independent studies, although there is currently one study being conducted at the University of Sydney, Australia.

In a 2007 study, children whose families had participated in RDI and who had relatively high IQ at start of treatment showed dramatic changes in diagnostic category on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), though the study represented a non-experimental study without a control group and whose evaluators were not blinded to time in treatment.

<text>Syrniki (; ) or syrnyky (Ukrainian: сирники, cheese cakes) are fried Eastern Slavic quark (curd cheese) pancakes. They are a part of Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, Latvian (&quot;biezpiena plācenīši&quot;) and Lithuanian cuisine (&quot;varškėčiai&quot;). In Russia, they are also known as tvorozhniki (творо́жники).

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;syrniki&quot; is derived from the Slavic word &quot;syr&quot; (сир), meaning a soft curd cheese. The Ukrainian language retains the old Slavic sense of the word, as in &quot;domashnii syr&quot; (домашній сир, literal translation &#x27;domestic cheese&#x27;), whereas in Russian another old Slavic word for curd cheese, &quot;tvorog&quot; (творог), is used.

== Preparation ==
Syrnyky or tvorozhniki are made from creamy tvorog, mixed with flour, eggs and sugar, sometimes adding vanilla extract. Pot cheese or farmer&#x27;s cheese or quark is suggested as a substitute for the &quot;tvorog&quot;. The soft mixture is shaped into cakes, which are pan- or shallow-fried in vegetable oil or in hot butter. The consistency should remain slightly creamy, while they are slightly browned on both sides. They are traditionally sweet and served for breakfast or dessert, but can be made savory as well. Raisins, chopped dried apricot, fresh apples or pears are sometimes added into the batter. They are typically served with varenye, jam, smetana (sour cream) and / or melted butter.

== Outside Eastern Europe ==
Their equivalent in Germany, especially East Germany, are the Quarkkäulchen. Syrniki have gained popularity in Israel in recent years, brought by immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.

<doc id="466440" wikidata="Q574905" url="?curid=466440" title="Clostridioides difficile infection">
<text>Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection(CDIorC-diff), also known as Clostridium difficile&quot; infection, is a symptomatic infection due to the spore-forming bacterium &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea. Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and sepsis.
&quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces. Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers. Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor use, hospitalization, hypoalbuminemia, other health problems, and older age. Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria&#x27;s DNA or toxins. If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as &quot;C. difficile&quot; colonization rather than an infection.
Prevention efforts include terminal room cleaning in hospitals, limiting antibiotic use, and handwashing campaigns in hospitals. Alcohol based hand sanitizer does not appear effective. Discontinuation of antibiotics may result in resolution of symptoms within three days in about 20% of those infected.

The antibiotics metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin, will cure the infection. Retesting after treatment, as long as the symptoms have resolved, is not recommended, as a person may often remain colonized. Recurrences have been reported in up to 25% of people. Some tentative evidence indicates fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics may decrease the risk of recurrence.
&quot;C. difficile&quot; infections occur in all areas of the world. About 453,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2011, resulting in 29,000 deaths. Global rates of disease increased between 2001 and 2016. &quot;C. difficile&quot; infections occur more often in women than men. The bacterium was discovered in 1935 and found to be disease-causing in 1978. Attributable costs for &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection in hospitalized adults range from
$4500 to $15,000. In the United States, healthcare-associated infections increase the cost of care by US$1.5 billion each year. Although &quot;C. difficile&quot; is a common healthcare-associated infection, at most 30% of infections are transmitted within hospitals. The majority of infections are acquired outside of hospitals, where medications and a recent history of diarrheal illnesses (e.g. laxative abuse or food poisoning due to salmonellosis) are thought to drive the risk of colonization.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of CDI range from mild diarrhea to severe life-threatening inflammation of the colon.

In adults, a clinical prediction rule found the best signs to be significant diarrhea (&quot;new onset of more than three partially formed or watery stools per 24-hour period&quot;), recent antibiotic exposure, abdominal pain, fever (up to 40.5 °C or 105 °F), and a distinctive foul odor to the stool resembling horse manure. In a hospital population, prior antibiotic treatment plus diarrhea or abdominal pain had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 45%. In this study with a prevalence of positive cytotoxin assays of 14%, the positive predictive value was 18% and the negative predictive value was 94%.

In children, the most prevalent symptom of a CDI is watery diarrhea with at least three bowel movements a day for two or more days, which may be accompanied by fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or abdominal pain. Those with a severe infection also may develop serious inflammation of the colon and have little or no diarrhea.

== Cause ==
Infection with &quot;C. difficile&quot; bacteria is responsible for &quot;C. difficile&quot; diarrhea.

=== &quot;C. difficile&quot; ===

Clostridia are anaerobic motile bacteria, ubiquitous in nature, and especially prevalent in soil. Under the microscope, they appear as long, irregular (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) cells with a bulge at their terminal ends. Under gram staining, &quot;C. difficile&quot; cells are gram-positive and show optimum growth on blood agar at human body temperatures in the absence of oxygen. When stressed, the bacteria produce spores that are able to tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot tolerate.

&quot;C. difficile&quot; may colonize the human colon without symptom; approximately 2–5% of the adult population are carriers, although it varies considerably with demographics. The risk of colonization has been linked to a history of unrelated diarrheal illnesses (e.g. laxative abuse and food poisoning due to Salmonellosis or Vibrio cholerae infection).

Pathogenic &quot;C. difficile&quot; strains produce multiple toxins. The most well-characterized are enterotoxin (&quot;Clostridium difficile&quot; toxin A) and cytotoxin (&quot;Clostridium difficile&quot; toxin B), both of which may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected people, although their relative contributions have been debated. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Another toxin, binary toxin, also has been described, but its role in disease is not fully understood.

Antibiotic treatment of CDIs may be difficult, due both to antibiotic resistance and physiological factors of the bacteria (spore formation, protective effects of the pseudomembrane). The emergence of a new and highly toxic strain of &quot;C. difficile&quot; that is resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, said to be causing geographically dispersed outbreaks in North America, was reported in 2005. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta warned of the emergence of an epidemic strain with increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, or both.

&quot;C. difficile&quot; is transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route. The organism forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon. The presence of the bile acid deoxycholic acid in the intestinal environment can promote induction of &quot;C. difficle&quot; biofilm formation. People without a history of gastrointestinal disturbances due to antibiotic use or diarrheal illness are less likely to become colonized by &quot;C. difficile&quot;.

In 2005, molecular analysis led to the identification of the &quot;C. difficile&quot; strain type characterized as group BI by restriction endonuclease analysis, as North American pulse-field-type NAP1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and as ribotype 027; the differing terminology reflects the predominant techniques used for epidemiological typing. This strain is referred to as &quot;C. difficile&quot; BI/NAP1/027.

=== Risk factors ===

==== Antibiotics ====
&quot;C. difficile&quot; colitis is associated most strongly with the use of these antibiotics: fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and clindamycin.

Some research suggests the routine use of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as &quot;C. difficile&quot;.

==== Healthcare environment ====
People are most often infected in hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical institutions, although infection outside medical settings is increasing. Individuals can develop the infection if they touch objects or surfaces that are contaminated with feces and then touch their mouth or mucous membranes. Healthcare workers could possibly spread the bacteria or contaminate surfaces through hand contact. The rate of &quot;C. difficile&quot; acquisition is estimated to be 13% in those with hospital stays of up to two weeks, and 50% with stays longer than four weeks.

Long-term hospitalization or residence in a nursing home within the previous year are independent risk factors for increased colonization.

==== Acid suppression medication ====
Increasing rates of community-acquired CDI are associated with the use of medication to suppress gastric acid production: H2-receptor antagonists increased the risk 1.5-fold, and proton pump inhibitors by 1.7 with once-daily use and 2.4 with more than once-daily use. Increased risk in recurrent CDI is also found with gastric acid repression use in observational studies, with a rate of 22.1%, compared to patients without gastric acid repression has a rate of 17.3% of recurrent CDI.

==== Diarrheal illnesses ====
People with a recent history of diarrheal illness are at increased risk of becoming colonized by &quot;C. difficile&quot; when exposed to spores, including laxative abuse and gastrointestinal pathogens. Disturbances that increase intestinal motility are thought to transiently elevate the concentration of available dietary sugars, allowing &quot;C. difficile&quot; to proliferate and gain a foothold in the gut. Although not all colonization events lead to disease, asymptomatic carriers remain colonized for years at a time. During this time, the abundance of &quot;C. difficile&quot; varies considerably day-to-day, causing periods of increased shedding that could substantially contribute to community-acquired infection rates.

==== Other ====
As a result of suppression of healthy bacteria, via a loss of bacterial food source, prolonged use of an elemental diet increases the risk of developing &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. Low serum albumin levels is a risk factor for the development of &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection and when infected for severe disease. The protective effects of serum albumin may be related to the capability of this protein to bind &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin A and toxin B, thus impairing entry into enterocytes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been identified as a risk factor in the development of a &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. Patients with CKD have a higher risk of both initial and recurring infection, as well as a higher chance of severe infection, than those without CKD. Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease are also at higher risk for infection and a recent study suggests they may have intermittent &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection masked by IBD symptoms, and testing should be considered in patients with changes in disease activity.

== Pathophysiology ==
The use of systemic antibiotics, including broad-spectrum penicillins/cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin, causes the normal microbiota of the bowel to be altered. In particular, when the antibiotic kills off other competing bacteria in the intestine, any bacteria remaining will have less competition for space and nutrients. The net effect is to permit more extensive growth than normal of certain bacteria. &quot;C. difficile&quot; is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, &quot;C. difficile&quot; also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, &quot;C. difficile&quot; may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection is part of an inflammatory reaction, with the &quot;pseudomembrane&quot; formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.

== Diagnosis ==

Prior to the advent of tests to detect &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxins, the diagnosis most often was made by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The appearance of &quot;pseudomembranes&quot; on the mucosa of the colon or rectum is highly suggestive, but not diagnostic of the condition. The pseudomembranes are composed of an exudate made of inflammatory debris, white blood cells. Although colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are still employed, now stool testing for the presence of &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxins is frequently the first-line diagnostic approach. Usually, only two toxins are tested for—toxin A and toxin B—but the organism produces several others. This test is not 100% accurate, with a considerable false-negative rate even with repeat testing.

=== Classification ===
CDI may be classified in non-severe CDI, severe CDI and fulminant CDI depending on creatinine and white blood count parameters.

=== Cytotoxicity assay ===
&quot;C. difficile&quot; toxins have a cytopathic effect in cell culture, and neutralization of any effect observed with specific antisera is the practical gold standard for studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it is slow and labor-intensive.

=== Toxin ELISA ===
Assessment of the A and B toxins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for toxin A or B (or both) has a sensitivity of 63–99% and a specificity of 93–100%, depending on detection assays.
Previously, experts recommended sending as many as three stool samples to rule out disease if initial tests are negative, but evidence suggests repeated testing during the same episode of diarrhea is of limited value and should be discouraged. &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin should clear from the stool of somebody previously infected if treatment is effective. Many hospitals only test for the prevalent toxin A. Strains that express only the B toxin are now present in many hospitals, however, so testing for both toxins should occur. Not testing for both may contribute to a delay in obtaining laboratory results, which is often the cause of prolonged illness and poor outcomes.

=== Other stool tests ===
Stool leukocyte measurements and stool lactoferrin levels also have been proposed as diagnostic tests, but may have limited diagnostic accuracy.

=== Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ===

Testing of stool samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction is able to detect &quot;C. difficile&quot; about 93% of the time and when positive is incorrectly positive about 3% of the time. This is more accurate than cytotoxigenic culture or cell cytotoxicity assay. Another benefit is that the result can be achieved within three hours. Drawbacks include a higher cost and the fact that the test only looks for the gene for the toxin and not the toxin itself. The latter means that if the test is used without confirmation, overdiagnosis may occur. Repeat testing may be misleading, and testing specimens more than once every seven days in people without new symptoms is highly unlikely to yield useful information. The screening specificity is relatively low because of the high number of false positive cases from asymptomatic infection.

== Prevention ==

Self containment by housing people in private rooms is important to prevent the spread of &quot;C. difficile&quot;. Contact precautions are an important part of preventing the spread of  C. difficile. C. difficile does not often occur in people who are not taking antibiotics so limiting use of antibiotics decreases the risk.

=== Antibiotics ===
The most effective method for preventing CDI is proper antibiotic prescribing. In the hospital setting, where CDI is most common, most people who develop CDI are exposed to antibiotics. Although proper antibiotic prescribing is highly recommended, about 50% is considered inappropriate. This is consistent whether in the hospital, clinic, community, or academic setting. A decrease in CDI by limiting antibiotics or by limiting unnecessary prescriptions in general, both in an outbreak and non-outbreak setting has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with reduced CDI. Further, reactions to medication may be severe: CDI infections were the most common contributor to adverse drug events seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011. In some regions of the UK, reduced used of fluoroquinolone antibiotics seems to lead to reduced rates of CDI.

=== Probiotics ===
Some evidence indicates probiotics may be useful to prevent infection and recurrence. Treatment with &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; in those who are not immunocompromised with &quot;C. difficile&quot; also may be useful. Initially, in 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended against their use due to the risk of complications. Subsequent reviews, however, did not find an increase in adverse effects with treatment, and overall treatment appears safe and moderately effective in preventing C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

One study in particular found that there does appear to be a &quot;protective effect&quot; of probiotics, specifically reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) by 51% in 3,631 outpatients, but it is important to note that the types of infections in the subjects were not specified. 

=== Infection control ===
Rigorous infection protocols are required to minimize this risk of transmission. Infection control measures, such as wearing gloves and noncritical medical devices used for a single person with CDI, are effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of &quot;C. difficile&quot; in the hospital setting. In addition, washing with soap and water will wash away the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective. These precautions should remain in place among those in hospital for at least 2 days after the diarrhea has stopped.

Bleach wipes containing 0.55% sodium hypochlorite have been shown to kill the spores and prevent transmission. Installing lidded toilets and closing the lid prior to flushing also reduces the risk of contamination.

Those who have CDIs should be in rooms with other people with CDIs or by themselves when in hospital.

Common hospital disinfectants are ineffective against &quot;C. difficile&quot; spores, and may promote spore formation, but various oxidants (e.g 1% sodium hypochlorite solution) rapidly destroy spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a room after treatment is completed have been shown to reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to others. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53% or 42% through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices, and housekeeping staff especially dedicated to disinfecting the rooms of people with &quot;C. difficile&quot; after discharge may be effective.

== Treatment ==
Carrying &quot;C. difficile&quot; without symptoms is common. Treatment in those without symptoms is controversial. In general, mild cases do not require specific treatment. Oral rehydration therapy is useful in treating dehydration associated with the diarrhea.

=== Medications ===
Several different antibiotics are used for &quot;C. difficile&quot;, with the available agents being more or less equally effective.

Vancomycin or fidaxomicin by mouth are the typically recommended for mild, moderate, and severe infections. They are also the first-line treatment for pregnant women, especially since metronidazole may cause birth defects. Typical vancomycin 125 mg is taken four times a day by mouth for 10 days. Fidaxomicin is taken at 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. It may also be given rectally if the person develops an ileus.

Fidaxomicin is tolerated as well as vancomycin, and may have a lower risk of recurrence. Fidaxomicin has been found to be as effective as vancomycin in those with mild to moderate disease, and it may be better than vancomycin in those with severe disease. Fidaxomicin may be used in those who have recurrent infections and have not responded to other antibiotics. Metronidazole (500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days) by mouth is recommended as an alternative treatment only for &quot;C. difficile&quot; infections when the affected person is allergic to first-line treatments, is unable to tolerate them, or has financial difficulties preventing them from accessing them. In fulminant disease vancomycin by mouth and intravenous metronidazole are commonly used together.

Medications used to slow or stop diarrhea, such as loperamide, may only be used after initiating the treatment.

Cholestyramine, an ion-exchange resin, is effective in binding both toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility, and helping prevent dehydration. Cholestyramine is recommended with vancomycin. A last-resort treatment in those who are immunosuppressed is intravenous immunoglobulin. Monoclonal antibodies against &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin A and &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin B are approved to prevent recurrence of &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection including bezlotoxumab.

=== Probiotics ===
Evidence to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of active disease is insufficient. Researchers have recently begun taking a mechanical approach to fecal-derived products. It is known that certain microbes with 7α-dehydroxylase activity can metabolize primary to secondary bile acids, which inhibit C. difficile. Thus, incorporating such microbes into therapeutic products such as probiotics may be protective, although more pre-clinical investigations are needed.

=== Fecal microbiota transplantation ===
Fecal microbiota transplant, also known as a stool transplant, is roughly 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of the microbiota acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replenishes the normal colonic microbiota that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;. Side effects, at least initially, are few.

Fecal microbiota, live (Rebyota) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2022.

Fecal microbiota spores, live (Vowst) was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2023. It is the first fecal microbiota product that is taken by mouth. A 2023 review article discusses the beneficial effects of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection 

=== Surgery ===
In those with severe &quot;C. difficile&quot; colitis, colectomy may improve the outcomes. Specific criteria may be used to determine who will benefit most from surgery.

===Recurrent infection===
Recurrent CDI occurs in 20 to 30% of the patients, with increasing rates of recurrence with each subsequent episode. In clinical settings, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a recurrence that develops as a relapse of CDI with the same strain of &quot;C. difficile&quot; versus reinfection that is the result of a new strain. However, in laboratory settings paired isolates can be differentiated using Whole-Genome Sequencing or Multilocus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis.

Several treatment options exist for recurrent &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. For the first episode of recurrent &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection, the 2017 IDSA guidelines recommend oral vancomycin at a dose of 125 mg four times daily for 10 days if metronidazole was used for the initial episode. If oral vancomycin was used for the initial episode, then a prolonged oral vancomycin pulse dose of 125 mg four times daily for 10–14 days followed by a taper (twice daily for one week, then every two to three days for 2–8 weeks) or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. For a second recurrent episode, the IDSA recommends options including the aforementioned oral vancomycin pulse dose followed by the prolonged taper; oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days followed by rifaximin 400 mg three times daily for 20 days; fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days, or a fecal microbiota transplant.

For patients with C. diff infections that fail to be resolved with traditional antibiotic regimens, fecal microbiome transplants boasts an average cure rate of &gt;90%. In a review of 317 patients, it was shown to lead to resolution in 92% of the persistent and recurrent disease cases. It is clear that restoration of gut flora is paramount in the struggle against recurrent CDI. With effective antibiotic therapy, C. difficile can be reduced and natural colonization resistance can develop over time as the natural microbial community recovers. Reinfection or recurrence may occur before this process is complete. Fecal microbiota transplant may expedite this recovery by directly replacing the missing microbial community members. However, human-derived fecal matter is difficult to standardize and has multiple potential risks, including the transfer of infectious material and long-term consequences of inoculating the gut with a foreign fecal material. As a result, further research is necessary to study the long term effective outcomes of FMT.

== Prognosis ==
After a first treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin, &quot;C. difficile&quot; recurs in about 20% of people. This increases to 40% and 60% with subsequent recurrences.

== Epidemiology ==
&quot;C. difficile&quot; diarrhea is estimated to occur in eight of 100,000 people each year. Among those who are admitted to hospital, it occurs in between four and eight people per 1,000. In 2011, it resulted in about half a million infections and 29,000 deaths in the United States.

Due in part to the emergence of a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain, &quot;C. difficile&quot;-related deaths increased 400% between 2000 and 2007 in the United States. According to the CDC, &quot;&quot;C. difficile&quot; has become the most common microbial cause of healthcare-associated infections in U.S. hospitals and costs up to $4.8 billion each year in excess health care costs for acute care facilities alone.&quot;

== History ==
Ivan C. Hall and Elizabeth O&#x27;Toole first named the bacterium &quot;Bacillus difficilis&quot; in 1935, choosing its specific epithet because it was resistant to early attempts at isolation and grew very slowly in culture. André Romain Prévot subsequently transferred it to &quot;Clostridium&quot;, binomen &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot;. Its combination was later changed to &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; after being transferred to the new genus &quot;Clostridioides&quot;.

Pseudomembranous colitis first was described as a complication of &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection in 1978, when a toxin was isolated from people with pseudomembranous colitis and Koch&#x27;s postulates were met.

=== Notable outbreaks ===
* On 4 June 2003, two outbreaks of a highly virulent strain of this bacterium were reported in Montreal, Quebec, and Calgary, Alberta. Sources put the death count to as low as 36 and as high as 89, with around 1,400 cases in 2003 and within the first few months of 2004. CDIs continued to be a problem in the Quebec healthcare system in late 2004. As of March 2005, it had spread into the Toronto area, hospitalizing 10 people. One died while the others were being discharged.
* A similar outbreak took place at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2005. The local epidemiology of &quot;C. difficile&quot; may offer clues on how its spread may relate to the time a patient spends in hospital and/or a rehabilitation center. It also samples the ability of institutions to detect increased rates, and their capacity to respond with more aggressive hand-washing campaigns, quarantine methods, and the availability of yogurt containing live cultures to patients at risk for infection.
* Both the Canadian and English outbreaks possibly were related to the seemingly more virulent strain NAP1/027 of the bacterium. Known as Quebec strain, it has been implicated in an epidemic at two Dutch hospitals (Harderwijk and Amersfoort, both 2005). A theory for explaining the increased virulence of 027 is that it is a hyperproducer of both toxins A and B and that certain antibiotics may stimulate the bacteria to hyperproduce.
* On 1 October 2006, &quot;C. difficile&quot; was said to have killed at least 49 people at hospitals in Leicester, England, over eight months, according to a National Health Service investigation. Another 29 similar cases were investigated by coroners. A UK Department of Health memo leaked shortly afterward revealed significant concern in government about the bacterium, described as being &quot;endemic throughout the health service&quot;
* On 27 October 2006, nine deaths were attributed to the bacterium in Quebec.
* On 18 November 2006, the bacterium was reported to have been responsible for 12 deaths in Quebec. This 12th reported death was only two days after the St. Hyacinthe&#x27;s Honoré Mercier announced the outbreak was under control. Thirty-one people were diagnosed with CDIs. Cleaning crews took measures in an attempt to clear the outbreak.
* &quot;C. difficile&quot; was mentioned on 6,480 death certificates in 2006 in UK.
* On 27 February 2007, a new outbreak was identified at Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, where 14 people were diagnosed with CDIs. The bacteria were of the same strain as the one in Quebec. Officials have not been able to determine whether &quot;C. difficile&quot; was responsible for the deaths of four people over the prior two months.
* Between February and June 2007, three people at Loughlinstown Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, were found by the coroner to have died as a result of &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. In an inquest, the Coroner&#x27;s Court found the hospital had no designated infection control team or consultant microbiologist on staff.
* Between June 2007 and August 2008, Northern Health and Social Care Trust Northern Ireland, Antrim Area, Braid Valley, Mid Ulster Hospitals were the subject of inquiry. During the inquiry, expert reviewers concluded that &quot;C. difficile&quot; was implicated in 31 of these deaths, as the underlying cause in 15, and as a contributory cause in 16. During that time, the review also noted 375 instances of CDIs in those being treated at the hospital.
* In October 2007, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust was heavily criticized by the Healthcare Commission regarding its handling of a major outbreak of &quot;C. difficile&quot; in its hospitals in Kent from April 2004 to September 2006. In its report, the Commission estimated approximately 90 people &quot;definitely or probably&quot; died as a result of the infection.
* In November 2007, the 027 strain spread into several hospitals in southern Finland, with 10 deaths out of 115 infected people reported on 2007-12-14.
* In November 2009, four deaths at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Ireland have possible links to CDI. A further 12 people tested positive for infection, and another 20 showed signs of infection.
* From February 2009 to February 2010, 199 people at Herlev hospital in Denmark were suspected of being infected with the 027 strain. In the first half of 2009, 29 died in hospitals in Copenhagen after they were infected with the bacterium.
* In May 2010, a total of 138 people at four different hospitals in Denmark were infected with the 027 strain plus there were some isolated occurrences at other hospitals.
* In May 2010, 14 fatalities were related to the bacterium in the Australian state of Victoria. Two years later, the same strain of the bacterium was detected in New Zealand.
* On 28 May 2011, an outbreak in Ontario had been reported, with 26 fatalities as of 24 July 2011.
* In 2012/2013, a total of 27 people at one hospital in the south of Sweden (Ystad) were infected with 10 deaths. Five died of the strain 017.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
The genus name is from the Greek &quot;klōstēr&quot; (), &quot;spindle&quot;, and the specific name is from Latin &quot;difficile&quot;, neuter singular form of &quot;difficilis&quot; &quot;difficult, obstinate&quot;, chosen in reference to fastidiousness upon culturing.

Regarding the pronunciation of the current and former genus assignments, &quot;Clostridioides&quot; is and &quot;Clostridium&quot; is . Both genera still have species assigned to them, but this species is now classified in the former. Via the norms of binomial nomenclature, it is understood that the former binomial name of this species is now an alias.

Regarding the specific name, is the traditional norm, reflecting how medical English usually pronounces naturalized New Latin words (which in turn largely reflects traditional English pronunciation of Latin), although a restored pronunciation of is also sometimes used (the classical Latin pronunciation is reconstructed as ). The specific name is also commonly pronounced , as though it were French, which from a prescriptive viewpoint is a &quot;mispronunciation&quot; but from a linguistically descriptive viewpoint cannot be described as erroneous because it is so widely used among health care professionals; it can be described as &quot;the non-preferred variant&quot; from the viewpoint of sticking most regularly to New Latin in binomial nomenclature, which is also a valid viewpoint, although New Latin specific names contain such a wide array of extra-Latin roots (including surnames and jocular references) that extra-Latin pronunciation is involved anyway (as seen, for example, with &quot;Ba humbugi&quot;, &quot;Spongiforma squarepantsii&quot;, and hundreds of others).

== Research ==
* As of 2019, vaccine candidates providing immunity against &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin A and &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxin B have advanced the most in clinical research, but do not prevent bacterial colonization. A vaccine candidate by Pfizer is in a phase 3 clinical trial that is estimated to be completed in September 2021 and a vaccine candidate by GlaxoSmithKline is in a phase 1 clinical trial that is estimated to be completed in July 2021.
* CDA-1 and CDB-1 (also known as MDX-066/MDX-1388 and MBL-CDA1/MBL-CDB1) is an investigational, monoclonal antibody combination co-developed by Medarex and Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories (MBL) to target and neutralize &quot;C. difficile&quot; toxins A and B, for the treatment of CDI. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. gained worldwide rights to develop and commercialize CDA-1 and CDB-1 through an exclusive license agreement signed in April 2009. It is intended as an add-on therapy to one of the existing antibiotics to treat CDI.
* Nitazoxanide is a synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative indicated as an antiprotozoal agent (FDA-approved for the treatment of infectious diarrhea caused by &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot; and &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;) and also is currently being studied in &quot;C. difficile&quot; infections vs. vancomycin.
* Rifaximin, is a clinical-stage semisynthetic, rifamycin-based, nonsystemic antibiotic for CDI. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of infectious diarrhea and is being developed by Salix Pharmaceuticals.
* Other drugs for the treatment of CDI are under development and include rifalazil, tigecycline, ramoplanin, ridinilazole, and SQ641.
* Research has studied whether the appendix has any importance in &quot;C. difficile&quot;. The appendix is thought to have a function of housing good gut flora. In a study conducted in 2011, it was shown that when &quot;C. difficile&quot; bacteria were introduced into the gut, the appendix housed cells that increased the antibody response of the body. The B cells of the appendix migrate, mature, and increase the production of toxin A-specific IgA and IgG antibodies, leading to an increased probability of good gut flora surviving against the &quot;C. difficile&quot; bacteria.
* Taking non-toxic types of &quot;C. difficile&quot; after an infection has promising results with respect to preventing future infections.
* Treatment with bacteriophages directed against specific toxin-producing strains of &quot;C difficile&quot; are also being tested.
* A study in 2017 linked severe disease to trehalose in the diet.

<doc id="466454" wikidata="Q1750391" url="?curid=466454" title="Selective Service System">
<text>The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent agency of the United States government that maintains a database of registered male U.S. citizens and other U.S. residents potentially subject to military conscription (i.e., the draft). 

Although the U.S. military is currently an all-volunteer force, registration is still required for contingency planning and preparation for two types of draft: a general draft based on registration lists of males aged 18–25, and a special-skills draft based on professional licensing lists of workers in specified health care occupations. In the event of either type of draft, the Selective Service System would send out induction notices, adjudicate claims for deferments or exemptions, and assign draftees classified as conscientious objectors to alternative service work. 

All male U.S. citizens and immigrant non-citizens who are between the ages of 18 and 25 are required by law to have registered within 30 days of their 18th birthdays, and must notify the Selective Service within ten days of any changes to any of the information they provided on their registration cards, such as a change of address. The Selective Service System is a contingency mechanism for the possibility that conscription becomes necessary.

Registration with Selective Service may be required for various federal programs and benefits, including job training, federal employment, and naturalization.

The Selective Service System provides the names of all registrants to the Joint Advertising Marketing Research &amp; Studies (JAMRS) program for inclusion in the JAMRS Consolidated Recruitment Database. The names are distributed to the Services for recruiting purposes on a quarterly basis.

Regulations are codified at Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XVI.

==History==
===1917 to 1920===

Following the U.S. declaration of war against Germany on 6 April, the Selective Service Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 76) was passed by the 65th United States Congress on 18 May 1917, creating the Selective Service System. President Woodrow Wilson signed the act into law after the U.S. Army failed to meet its target of expanding to 1 million men after six weeks. The act gave the president the power to conscript men for military service. All men aged 21 to 30 were required to enlist for military service for a service period of 12 months. As of mid-November 1917, all registrants were placed in one of five new classifications. Men in Class I were the first to be drafted, and men in lower classifications were deferred. Dependency deferments for registrants who were fathers or husbands were especially widespread. The age limit was later raised in August 1918 to a maximum age of 45. The military draft was discontinued in 1920.

===1940 to 1947===
The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 was passed by Congress on 16 September 1940, establishing the first peacetime conscription in United States history. It required all men between the ages of 18 and 64 to register with the Selective Service. To register, men typically completed a D.S.S. Form 1 Military Draft Registration Card from the Director of Selective Service. Over 49 million draft cards were completed, including The Old Man&#x27;s Draft.

It originally conscripted all men aged 21 to 35 for a service period of 12 months. In 1941, the military service period was extended to 18 months; later that year the age bracket was increased to include men aged 18 to 37. In 1940, the act had registered 16 million men between the ages of 21-36. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and the subsequent declarations of war by the United States against the Empire of Japan and a few days later against Nazi Germany, the service period was subsequently extended in early 1942 to last for the duration of the war, plus a six-month service in the Organized Reserves. Until late 1942, both the U.S. Navy and the Marine Corps relied only on volunteers and all those drafted prior to late 1942 went only to the Army or the Army Air Corps. Of those called up for service during the war, nearly 2 million Americans were rejected by the draft boards for &quot;neuropsychiatic reasons&quot;. The most common &quot;neuropsychiatic reason&quot; was homosexuality, which was a considered to be a very serious mental illness in the 1940s and as such the military refused to accept homosexuals. Another four million American men called for national service were rejected for either medical or educational reasons, such as being near-sighted, having rotten teeth or being illiterate. As too many men were being rejected for health or educational reasons, the U.S. Army was forced to take remedial work. During the course of the war, 25,000 Army dentists pulled 15 million rotten teeth and placed 2.5 million sets of dentures while Army optometrists fitted 2.25 million men with eyeglasses. Nearly a million men took educational courses to teach them how to read and write. In November 1942, Congress passed the Tydings Amendment which exempted all agricultural workers from the draft, thereby exempting 2 million American men from serving in the war.

The question of drafting Black men caused much controversy as President Franklin D. Roosevelt had promised several African-American civil rights leaders in 1940 that the draft would be a color-blind one and in fact the Selective Service Act of 1940 stated &quot;there shall be no discrimination against any person on the account of race or color&quot;. However, the U.S. military practiced segregation during the war as Black Americans did not serve alongside men of other races and in practice Black men were only drafted to keep the all Black units of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Army Air Force up to strength. Furthermore, the military as a general rule preferred to use Black servicemen only in menial roles and as much as possible tried to avoid sending African-Americans into combat out of a belief that Black men were not brave enough. As such, the U.S. Army in particular did not form many divisions out of the Black men drafted, which limited the number of African-Americans subject to the draft. As a result of these practices, in early 1943 African-Americans made up 10.6% of the American population, but only 6% of the men serving in the military. 

The issue of conscientious objectors was a controversial one during the war. In World War One, only the so-called &quot;peace churches&quot;, namely the Mennonites, the Quakers and the Brethren had been allowed to reject national service on grounds of conscience. The 1940 Selective Service Act allowed the same exemption to the &quot;peace churches&quot;, but also allowed anyone &quot;who, by reason of religious training or belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form&quot;. In practice, draft boards would exempt anyone who prove they were opposed to war on grounds of some sort of religious belief, which allowed more to claim conscientious objector&#x27;s status than had been the case in World War One. About 75,000 Americans called for national service claimed conscientious objector status, and about half of these claims were accepted by the draft boards. Married men were exempt from the draft and in late 1940 about 40% called up for the draft were able to evade it by promptly getting married. In February 1942, General Hershey, who was in charge of the draft, complained &quot;that most of the recent marriages...might have been for the purpose of evading the draft&quot;. 

In his 1945 State of the Union address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that the draft be expanded to include female nurses (male nurses were not allowed), to overcome a shortage that was endangering military medical care. This began a debate over the drafting of all women, which was defeated in the House of Representatives. A bill to draft nurses was passed by the House, but died without a vote in the Senate. The publicity caused more nurses to volunteer and agencies streamlined recruiting.

The Selective Service System created by the 1940 act was terminated by the act of 31 March 1947.

===1948 to 1969===

The Selective Service Act of 1948, enacted in June of that year, created a new and separate system, the basis for the modern system. All men 18 years and older had to register with the Selective Service. All men between the ages of 18 and 25 were eligible to be drafted for a service requirement of 21 months. This was followed by a commitment for either 12 consecutive months of active service or 36 consecutive months of service in the reserves, with a statutory term of military service set at a minimum of five years total. Conscripts could volunteer for military service in the regular United States Army for a term of four years or the Organized Reserves for a term of six years. Due to deep postwar budget cuts, only 100,000 conscripts were chosen in 1948. In 1950, the number of conscripts was greatly increased to meet the demands of the Korean War (1950–1953).

The outbreak of the Korean War fostered the creation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951. This lowered the draft age from 19 to , increased active-duty service time from 21 to 24 months, and set the statutory term of military service at a minimum of eight years. Students attending a college or training program full-time could request an exemption, which was extended as long as they were students. A Universal Military Training clause was inserted that would have made all men obligated to perform 12 months of military service and training if the act was amended by later legislation. Despite successive attempts over the next several years, however, such legislation was never passed.

President John F. Kennedy set up (signed on 10 September 1963), granting an exemption from conscription for married men between the ages of 19 and 26. His vice president and later successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, later rescinded the exemption for married men without children by (signed on 26 August 1965 and going into effect on midnight of that date). However, married men with children or other dependents and men married before the executive order went into effect were still exempt. President Ronald Reagan revoked both of them with (signed on 25 February 1986).

The Military Selective Service Act of 1967 expanded the ages of conscription to the ages of 18 to 55. It still granted student deferments, but ended them upon either the student&#x27;s completion of a four-year degree or his 24th birthday, whichever came first.

===1969 to 1975===
On 26 November 1969, President Richard Nixon signed an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 that established conscription based on random selection (lottery). The first draft lottery was held on 1 December 1969; it determined the order of call for induction during calendar year 1970, for registrants born between 1 January 1944, and 31 December 1950. The highest lottery number called for possible induction was 195. The second lottery, on 1 July 1970, pertained to men born in 1951. The highest lottery number called for possible induction was 125. The third was on 5 August 1971, pertaining to men born in 1952; the highest lottery number called was 95.

In 1971, the Military Selective Service Act was further amended to make registration compulsory; all men had to register within a period 30 days before and 29 days after their 18th birthdays. Registrants were classified &quot;1-A&quot; (eligible for military service), &quot;1-AO&quot; (conscientious objector available for non-combatant military service), and &quot;1-O&quot; (conscientious objector available for alternate community service). Student deferments were ended, except for divinity students, who received a &quot;2-D&quot; Selective Service classification. Men who were not classifiable as eligible for service due to a disqualification were classified &quot;1-N&quot;. Men who are incapable of serving for medical or psychological unfitness are classified &quot;4-F&quot;. Upon completion of military service the classification of &quot;4-A&quot; was assigned. Draft classifications of &quot;1-A&quot; were changed to &quot;1-H&quot; (registrant not currently subject to processing for induction) for men not selected for service after the calendar year they were eligible for the draft. (These – and other – draft classifications were in place long before 1971.) Also, draft board membership requirements were reformed: minimum age of board members was dropped from 30 to 18, members over 65 or who had served on the board for 20 or more years had to retire, and membership had to proportionally reflect the ethnic and cultural makeup of the local community.

On 27 January 1973, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced the creation of an all-volunteer armed forces, negating the need for the military draft. The seventh and final lottery drawing was held on 12 March 1975, pertaining to men born in 1956, who would have been called to report for induction in 1976. But no new draft orders were issued after 1972.

===1975 to 1980===
On 29 March 1975, President Gerald Ford, whose own son, Steven, had earlier failed to register for the draft as required, signed Proclamation 4360 (Terminating Registration Procedures Under Military Selective Service Act), eliminating the registration requirement for all 18- to 25-year-old male citizens.

===1980 to present===
On 2 July 1980, President Jimmy Carter, signed Proclamation 4771 (Registration Under the Military Selective Service Act) in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the previous year of 1979, retroactively re-establishing the Selective Service registration requirement for all 18- to 26-year-old male citizens born on or after 1 January 1960. As a result, only men born between 29 March 1957, and 31 December 1959, were completely exempt from Selective Service registration.

The first registrations after Proclamation 4771 took place at various post offices across the nation on 21 July 1980, for men born in calendar year 1960. Pursuant to the presidential proclamation, all those men born in 1960 were required to register that week. Men born in 1961 were required to register the following week. Men born in 1962 were required to register during the week beginning 5 January 1981. Men born in 1963 and after were required to register within 30 days before or after their 18th birthday.

A bill to abolish the Selective Service System was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on 10 February 2016. H.R. 4523 would end draft registration and eliminate the authority of the president to order anyone to register for the draft, abolish the Selective Service System, and effectively repeal the &quot;Solomon Amendments&quot; making registration for the draft a condition of federal student aid, jobs, and job training. The bill would leave in place, however, laws in some states making registration for the draft a condition of some state benefits. On 9 June 2016, a similar bill was introduced in the United States Senate, called the &quot;Muhammad Ali Voluntary Service Act&quot;.

On 27 April 2016, the House Armed Services Committee voted to add an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 to extend the authority for draft registration to women. On 12 May 2016, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to add a similar provision to its version of the bill. If the bill including this provision had been enacted into law, it would have authorized (but not require) the president to order young women as well as young men to register with the Selective Service System.

The House-Senate conference committee for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 removed the provision of the House version of the bill that would have authorized the president to order women as well as men to register with the Selective Service System, but added a new section to create a &quot;National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service&quot; (NCMNPS). This provision was enacted into law on 23 December 2016 as Subtitle F of Public Law 114–328. The commission was to study and make recommendations by March 2020 on the draft, draft registration, registration of women, and &quot;the feasibility and advisability of modifying the military selective service process in order to obtain for military, national, and public service individuals with skills (such as medical, dental, and nursing skills, language skills, cyber skills, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills) for which the Nation has a critical need, without regard to age or sex&quot;. During 2018 and 2019, the commission held both public and closed-door meetings with members of the public and invited experts and other witnesses.

In February 2019, a challenge to the Military Selective Service Act, which provides for the male-only draft, by the National Coalition for Men, was deemed unconstitutional by Judge Gray H. Miller in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Miller&#x27;s opinion was based on the Supreme Court&#x27;s past argument in &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot; (1981) which had found the male-only draft constitutional because the military then did not allow women to serve. As the Department of Defense has since lifted most restrictions on women in the military, Miller ruled that the justifications no longer apply, and thus the act requiring only men to register would now be considered unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The government appealed this decision to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments on the appeal were heard on 3 March 2020. The District Court decision was reversed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. A petition for review was declined by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In December 2019, the bipartisan &quot;Selective Service Repeal Act&quot;, a bill to repeal the Military Selective Service Act and abolish the Selective Service System, H.R. 5492, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives Peter DeFazio (D-OR) and Rodney Davis (R-IL). This bill was reintroduced in both the House (H.R. 2509) and the Senate (S. 1139) on 14 April 2021.

In January 2020, the Selective Service System website crashed following the U.S. airstrike on Baghdad International Airport. An Internet meme about the event being the beginning of World War III began gaining in popularity very quickly, causing an influx of visitors to the Selective Service System website, which was not prepared to handle it.

==Who must register==

Under current law, all male U.S. citizens between 18 and 25 (inclusive) years of age are required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthdays. In addition, certain categories of non-U.S. citizen men between 18 and 25 living in the United States must register, particularly permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants. Foreign men lawfully present in the United States who are non-immigrants, such as international students, visitors, and diplomats, are not required to register, so long as they remain in that status. If an alien&#x27;s non-immigrant status lapses while he is in the United States and under the age of 26, he will be required to register. Failure to register as required is grounds for denying a petition for U.S. citizenship. Currently, citizens who are at least 17 years and 3 months old can pre-register so when they are eligible for registration, their information will automatically be added into the system.

In the current registration system, a person cannot indicate that they are a conscientious objector (CO) to war when registering, but they can make such a claim when being drafted. Some people choose to write on the registration card &quot;I am a conscientious objector to war&quot; to document their conviction, even though the government will not have such a classification until there is a draft. A number of private organizations have programs for conscientious objectors to file a written record stating their beliefs.

In 1987, Congress ordered the Selective Service System to put in place a system capable of drafting &quot;persons qualified for practice or employment in a health care occupation&quot; in case such a special-skills draft should be ordered by Congress. In response, the Selective Service published plans for the &quot;Health Care Personnel Delivery System&quot; (HCPDS) in 1989, and has had them ready ever since. The concept underwent a preliminary field exercise in fiscal year 1998, followed by a more extensive nationwide readiness exercise in fiscal year 1999. The HCPDS plans include women and men age 20–54 in 57 job categories.

Until their 26th birthdays, registered men must notify Selective Service within 10 days of any changes to information regarding their status, such as name, current mailing address, permanent residence address, and &quot;all information concerning his status... which the classifying authority mails him a request therefor&quot;.

===Gender===
Selective Service bases the registration requirement on sex assigned at birth, and forces binary interpretation of this, including upon intersex individuals. This is in line with a presidential executive order denying any legal recognition of transgender individuals&#x27; gender identities, social transition status, and medical transition status, as well the legal existence of intersex individuals, which was issued by the second Trump Administration on January 20th, 2025.

Prior to the second Trump Administration taking office and purging all references to transgender and gender non-conforming people on government websites, according to the SSS, individuals who were born male were required to register regardless of their current gender identity or gender reassignment. This included transgender women. People who were born female who have transitioned, or are in the process of transitioning (transgender men), were not required to register. Individuals who identified as non-binary were required to register if they were born male. U.S. citizens register for the SSS using their Social Security Number and the sex designation associated with that number. It was possible to change the sex associated with a Social Security Number (SSN), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) did not require medical or legal evidence of a sex designation to do so. However, despite some states now allowing an &quot;X&quot; designation on official identification, like birth certificates, the current SSN system is only designed for male or female designations. The SSA was previously looking into more diverse designation options for the future, but this was put on hold by the Second Trump Administration, given a memo sent out to bar changes to gender markers on SSA records on January 31, 2025 and enforce a binary interpretation of sex, as noted in the aforementioned presidential executive order.

In February 2019, the male-only military draft registry was ruled to be unconstitutional by a federal district judge in &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot;. Following the ruling, Selective Service System attorney Jacob Daniels told reporters: &quot;Things continue here at Selective Service as they have in the past, which is men between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register with Selective Service. And at this time, until we receive guidance from either the court or from Congress, women are not required to register for Selective Service.&quot; On 13 August 2020, the federal district judge&#x27;s opinion was unanimously overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The Court held that male-only military draft registration is constitutional on the basis that &quot;only the Supreme Court may revise its precedent.&quot;

A congressionally mandated commission recommended in March 2020 that women should be eligible for the draft. In September 2021, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, which included an amendment that stated that &quot;all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 must register for selective service.&quot; This struck off the word &quot;Male&quot; which extended a potential draft to women; however, the amendment was removed before the National Defense Authorization Act was passed.

==Failure to register==
In 1980, men who knew they were required to register and did not do so could face up to five years in prison, fines of up to $50,000 or both if convicted. The potential fine was later increased to $250,000. Despite these possible penalties, government records indicate that from 1980 through 1986 there were only twenty indictments, of which nineteen were instigated in part by self-publicized and self-reported non-registration.

A principal element for conviction under the act is proving a violation of the act was intentional, i.e. knowing and willful. In the opinion of legal experts, this is almost impossible to prove unless there is evidence of a prospective defendant knowing about his obligation to register and intentionally choosing not to do so. Or, for example, when there is evidence the government at any time provided notice to the prospective defendant to register or report for induction, he was given an opportunity to comply, and the prospective defendant chose not to do so.

The last prosecution for non-registration was in January 1986. In interviews published in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in May 2016, current and former Selective Service System officials said that in 1988, the Department of Justice and Selective Service agreed to suspend any further prosecutions of non-registrants. No law since 1980 has required anyone to possess, carry, or show a draft card, and routine checks requiring identification virtually never include a request for a draft card.

As an alternative method of encouraging or coercing registration, Solomon Amendment laws were passed requiring that in order to receive financial aid, federal grants and loans, certain government benefits, eligibility for most federal employment, and (if the person is an immigrant) eligibility for citizenship, a young man had to be registered (or had to have been registered, if they are over 26 but were required to register between 18 and 26) with the Selective Service. Those who were required to register, but failed to do so before they turned 26, are no longer allowed to register, and thus may be permanently barred from federal jobs and other benefits, unless they can show to the Selective Service that their failure was not knowing and willful. There is a procedure to provide an &quot;information letter&quot; to the Selective Service for those in these situations, for example recent citizens who entered the U.S. after their 26th birthday. The federal law requiring Selective Service registration as a condition of federal financial aid for higher education was overridden in December 2020, and the questions about Selective Service registration status on the FAFSA form were eliminated on 1 July 2023.

Most states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin Islands, have passed laws requiring registration for men 18–25 to be eligible for programs that vary on a per-jurisdiction basis but typically include driver&#x27;s licenses, state-funded higher education benefits, and state government jobs. Alaska also requires registration to receive an Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. Eleven states (California, Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming) have no such requirements, though Indiana and Washington do give men 18–25 the option of registering with Selective Service when obtaining a driver&#x27;s license or an identification card. The Department of Motor Vehicles of 27 states and 2 territories automatically register young men 18–25 with the Selective Service whenever they apply for driver licenses, learner permits, or non-driver identification cards.

There are some third-party organized efforts to compensate financial aid for those students losing benefits, including the &quot;Fund for Education and Training &quot; (FEAT) and &quot;Student Aid Fund for Non-registrants&quot;.

==Alien or dual-national registrant status==
Some registrants are not U.S. citizens, or have dual nationality of the U.S. and another country; they fall instead into one of the following categories:
* Alien or Dual National (class 4-C): An alien is a person who is not a citizen of the United States. A dual national is a person who is a citizen of the United States and another country. They are defined in four classes.
** Registrants who have lived in the United States for less than a year are exempt from military training and service, but become eligible after a year of cumulative residence (counting disjoint time periods).
** A registrant who left the United States before his Order to Report for Induction was issued and whose order has not been canceled. He may be classified in Class 4-C only for the period he resides outside of the United States. Upon his return to the United States, he must report the date of return and his current address to the Selective Service Area Office.
** A registrant who registered at a time required by Selective Service law and thereafter acquired status within one of its groups of persons exempt from registration. He will be eligible for this class only during the period of his exempt status. To support this claim, the registrant must submit documentation from the diplomatic agency of the country of which he is a subject verifying his exempt status.
** A registrant, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, as defined in Paragraph (2) of Section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. 1101) who, by reason of their occupational status, is subject to adjustment to non-immigrant status under paragraph (15)(A), (15)(E), or (15)(G) or section 101(a). In this case, the person must also have executed a waiver of all rights, privileges, exemptions, and immunities which would otherwise accrue to him as a result of his occupational status.
* Dual national: The person is a citizen of both the United States and another country at the same time. The country must be one that allows its citizens dual citizenship and the registrant must be able to obtain and produce the proper papers to affirm this status.
* Treaty alien: Due to a treaty or international arrangement with the alien&#x27;s country of origin, the registrant can choose to be ineligible for military training and service in the armed forces of the United States. However, once this exemption is taken, he can never apply for U.S. citizenship and may become inadmissible to reenter the U.S. after leaving unless he already served in the Armed Forces of a foreign country of which the alien was a national. Nevertheless, an alien who establishes clear and convincing evidence of certain factors may still override this kind of bar to naturalization.

==Legal issues==
The Selective Service System is authorized by the Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution which says Congress &quot;shall have Power To... provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union;&quot; The Selective Service Act is the law which established the Selective Service System under these provisions.

The act has been challenged in light of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits &quot;involuntary servitude&quot;. These challenges, however, have not been supported by the courts; as the Supreme Court stated in &quot;Butler v. Perry&quot; (1916):
The amendment was adopted with reference to conditions existing since the foundation of our government, and the term &#x27;involuntary servitude&#x27; was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery which, in practical operation, would tend to produce like undesirable results. It introduced no novel doctrine with respect of services always treated as exceptional, and certainly was not intended to interdict enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.

During the First World War, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Arver v. United States&quot; (1918), also known as the Selective Draft Law Cases, that the draft did not violate the Constitution.

Later, during the Vietnam War, a federal appellate court concluded in &quot;Holmes v. United States&quot; (1968) that the draft was constitutional even during peacetime.

Since the reinstatement of draft registration in 1980, the Supreme Court has heard and decided four cases related to the Military Selective Service Act: &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), upholding the constitutionality of requiring men but not women to register for the draft; &quot;Selective Service v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG)&quot;, 468 U.S. 841 (1984), upholding the constitutionality of the &quot;Solomon Amendment&quot;, which requires applicants for Federal student aid to certify that they have complied with draft registration, either by having registered or by not being required to register; &quot;Wayte v. United States&quot;, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), upholding the policies and procedures which the Supreme Court thought the government had used to select the &quot;most vocal&quot; non-registrants for prosecution, after the government refused to comply with discovery orders by the trial court to produce documents and witnesses related to the selection of non-registrants for prosecution; and &quot;Elgin v. Department of Treasury&quot;, 567 U.S. 1 (2012), regarding procedures for judicial review of denial of federal employment for non-registrants.

The case &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot; resulted in the male-only draft registration being declared unconstitutional by a district court. That decision was reversed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. A petition for review was then filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision by the Court of Appeals.

==Structure and operation==
The Selective Service System is an independent federal agency within the Executive Branch of the federal government of the United States. The director of the Selective Service System reports directly to the president of the United States. Starting on the day of the inauguration of President Joe Biden, the Selective Service System was under an acting director following the departure of the previous director, Don Benton, and pending the nomination and confirmation of a new permanent director.

During peacetime, the agency comprises a national headquarters, three regional headquarters, and a data management center. Even during peacetime, the agency is also aided by 11,000 volunteers serving on local boards and district appeal boards. During a mobilization that required activation of the draft, the agency would greatly expand by activating an additional 56 state headquarters, more than 400 area offices, and over 40 alternative service offices.

The agency&#x27;s budget for the 2015–2016 fiscal year was about $23 million. In early 2016, the agency said that if women were required to register, its budget would need to be increased by about $9 million in the first year, and slightly less in subsequent years. This does not include any budget or expenses for enforcing or attempting to enforce the Military Selective Service Act. Costs of investigating, prosecuting, and imprisoning violators would be included in the budget of the Department of Justice.

==Mobilization (draft) procedures==
The description below is for a general draft under the current Selective Service regulations. Any or all of these procedures could be changed by Congress as part of the same legislation that would authorize inductions, or through separate legislation, so there is no guarantee that this is how any draft would actually work. Different procedures would be followed for a special-skills draft, such as activation of the Health Care Personnel Delivery System (HCPDS).

# Congress and the president authorize a draft: The president claims a crisis has occurred which requires more troops than the volunteer military can supply. Congress passes and the president signs legislation which revises the Military Selective Service Act to initiate a draft for military manpower.
# The lottery: A lottery based on birthdays determines the order in which registered men are called up by Selective Service. The first to be called, in a sequence determined by the lottery, will be men whose 20th birthday falls during the calendar year the induction takes place, followed, as needed, by those aged 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 19, and 18 (in that order).
# All parts of the Selective Service System are activated: The agency activates and orders its state directors and Reserve Force officers to report for duty.
# Physical, mental and moral evaluation of registrants: Registrants with low lottery numbers receive examination orders and are ordered to report for a physical, mental, and moral evaluation at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) to determine whether they are fit for military service. Once he is notified of the results of the evaluation, a registrant will be given 10 days to file a claim for exemption, postponement, or deferment.
# Local and appeal boards activated and induction notices sent: Local and appeal boards will begin processing registrant claims/appeals. Those who passed the military evaluation will receive induction orders. An inductee will have 10 days to report to a local MEPS for induction.
# First draftees are inducted: According to current plans, Selective Service must deliver the first inductees to the military within 193 days from the onset of a crisis.

==Lottery procedures==
If the agency were to mobilize and conduct a draft, a lottery would be held in full view of the public. First, all days of the year are placed into a capsule at random. Second, the numbers 1–365 (1–366 for lotteries held with respect to a leap year) are placed into a second capsule. These two capsules are certified for procedure, sealed in a drum, and stored.

In the event of a draft, the drums are taken out of storage and inspected to make sure they have not been tampered with. The lottery then takes place, and each date is paired with a number at random. For example, if 19 January is picked from the &quot;date&quot; capsule and the number 59 picked from the &quot;number&quot; capsule, all men of age 20 born on 19 January will be the 59th group to receive induction notices. This process continues until all dates are matched with a number.

Should all dates be used, the Selective Service will first conscript men at the age of 20, then 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 19, and 18. Once all dates are paired, the dates will be sent to Selective Service System&#x27;s Data Management Center.

==Classifications== 
===1948–1976===
===Present===
If a draft were authorized by Congress, without any other changes being made in the law, local boards would classify registrants to determine whether they were exempt from military service. According to the Code of Federal Regulations Title 32, Chapter XVI, Sec. 1630.2, men would be sorted into the following categories:
