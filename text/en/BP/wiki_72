<text>Tambov Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Tambov. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 1,091,994.

==Geography==
Tambov Oblast is situated in a forest steppe. It borders the Ryazan, Penza, Saratov, Voronezh and Lipetsk oblasts.

==History==
The oldest known population of the Tambov region, the Mordovians-Moksha, formed as a nation of local ethnic groups from the 6th century BC. The first Russian settlers arrived in the pre-Mongol period, but the final settlement occurred in the 17th century. To protect the southern borders of Russia from the raids of the Tatars, and to further develop the Black Soil region, the Russian government built the walled cities of Kozlov (1635) and Tambov (1636). The cities protected the main path of nomad raids on Russian land and paved the way for a quick settlement of the region.

Kozlovsky Uyezd originally existed in the Tambov area. In the course of the administrative reforms of Peter the Great in 1708 and 1719, it became part of Azov Governorate. New administrative divisions established the Tambov Viceroyalty in 1779 and from 1796 Tambov Governorate, with an area of 66.5 thousand km2 divided into 12 uyezds. With almost no change to its boundaries, the Governorate remained in existence until 1928.

An attempt to establish Soviet control over the Tambov area led to the defeat and execution of &quot;Red Sonya&quot; (Sofia Nukhimovna Gel&#x27;berg) in the spring of 1918.

During the Russian Civil War, an anti-Bolshevik uprising, the Tambov Rebellion, broke out in Tambov Governorate in 1920–1921.

Tambov Oblast was finally created from the Voronezh and Samara Oblasts on September 27, 1937. The oblast attained its present form after the separation of Penza Oblast (formerly part of Kuybyshev before joining Tambov) on February 4, 1939.

<text>The doctrine of signatures, dating from the time of Dioscorides and Galen, states that herbs resembling various parts of the body can be used by herbalists to treat ailments of those body parts. A theological justification, as stated by botanists such as William Coles, was that God would have wanted to show men what plants would be useful for.

Today considered pseudoscience, the practice has historically led to many deaths and severe illnesses. For instance, birthwort (so-called because of its resemblance to the uterus) was once used widely for pregnancies, but is carcinogenic and very damaging to the kidneys, owing to its aristolochic acid content. As a defense against predation, many plants contain toxic chemicals, the action of which is not immediately apparent, or easily tied to the plant rather than other factors.

== History ==
The concept dates from the time of Dioscorides and Galen.
Paracelsus (1493–1541) developed the concept, writing that &quot;Nature marks each growth ... according to its curative benefit&quot;, and it was followed by Giambattista della Porta in his &quot;Phytognomonica&quot; (1588).

The writings of Jakob Böhme (1575–1624) spread the doctrine of signatures. He suggested that God marked objects with a sign, or &quot;signature&quot;, for their purpose.
Plants bearing parts that resembled human body-parts, animals, or other objects were thought to have useful relevance to those parts, animals, or objects. The &quot;signature&quot; could sometimes also be identified in the environments or specific sites in which plants grew. Böhme&#x27;s 1621 book &quot;The Signature of All Things&quot; gave its name to the doctrine. The English physician-philosopher Sir Thomas Browne in his discourse &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; (1658) uses the Quincunx pattern as an archetype of the &#x27;doctrine of signatures&#x27; pervading the design of gardens and orchards, botany and the Macrocosm at large.

The 17th century botanist William Coles supposed that God had made &#x27;Herbes for the use of men, and hath given them particular Signatures, whereby a man may read ... the use of them.&#x27; Coles&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Simpling&quot; and &quot;Adam in Eden&quot;, stated that walnuts were good for curing head ailments because in his opinion, &quot;they Have the perfect Signatures of the Head&quot;. Regarding &quot;Hypericum&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The little holes whereof the leaves of Saint Johns wort are full, doe resemble all the pores of the skin and therefore it is profitable for all hurts and wounds that can happen thereunto.&quot;

A theological justification was made for this philosophy: &quot;It was reasoned that the Almighty must have set his sign upon the various means of curing disease which he provided&quot;.

For the late medieval viewer, the natural world was vibrant with images of the Deity: &#x27;as above, so below,&#x27; a Hermetic principle expressed as the relationship between macrocosm and microcosm; the principle is rendered &quot;sicut in terra&quot;. Michel Foucault expressed the wider usage of the doctrine of signatures, which rendered allegory more real and more cogent than it appears to a modern eye:
=== Signatures of some plants used in herbalism ===

The concept of signatures is reflected in the common names of some plants whose shapes and colors reminded herbalists of the parts of the body where they were thought to do good, as for instance:

* Eyebright, used for eye infections
* Hedge woundwort, thought to have antiseptic qualities
* Liverwort, either Marchantiophyta or Hepatica – used to treat the liver
* Lungwort – used for pulmonary infections
* Spleenwort, &quot;Asplenium&quot; – used to treat the spleen
* Toothwort, &quot;Dentaria&quot; – used for tooth ailments

Concepts similar to the doctrine of signatures may be found in folk or indigenous medicines, and in modern alternative medicines.

== In literature ==

The phrase &quot;signatures of all things&quot; appears in the beginning of episode 3 in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The character Stephen Dedalus walking along the beach, thinking to himself &quot;Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot&quot;. The Canadian poet Anne Szumigalski, 1922–1999, entitled her third full-length collection &quot;Doctrine of Signatures&quot;.

== Scientific skepticism ==

The signatures are described as post hoc attributions and mnemonics, of value only in creating a system for remembering actions attributed to medical herbs. There is no scientific evidence that plant shapes and colors help in the discovery of medical uses of plants.

Another explanation is that the human mind, in trying to find patterns to explain phenomena, while lacking adequate scientific knowledge, resorts to anthropomorphism.

<doc id="480938" wikidata="Q2347" url="?curid=480938" title="Smolensk Oblast">
<text>Smolensk Oblast (), informally also called Smolenshchina (), is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative centre is the city of Smolensk. As of the 2021 Census, its population was 888,421. 

==Geography==
The oblast was founded on 27 September 1937. It borders Pskov Oblast in the north, Tver Oblast in the northeast, Moscow Oblast in the east, Kaluga Oblast in south, Bryansk Oblast in the southwest, and Mogilev and Vitebsk Oblasts of Belarus, in the west and northwest, as part of the Belarus–Russia border.

===Hydrography===
The main river of the region is the Dnieper River and its tributaries, Desna, Vop, Vyazma. By the rivers of the Volga basin and its tributary Vazuza Gzhat and tributary of the Oka river, Ugra. To the north-west flows a short section of the Western Dvina River and its tributary river Kasplya .

Among the major reservoirs supplying water are Moscow Vazuzssky Yauza and reservoirs in the north-east, as well as cooling power plants, Smolensk reservoir in the north near the village of Lake and Desnogorsk Reservoir in the south area of the city near the Desnogorsk.

===Climate===
The climate of Smolensk Oblast is humid continental, similar to the climate of Moscow Oblast, but slightly warmer in winter due to being located further west. Summers are short, warm and rainy, while winters are long, cold and snowy. Average temperatures range from in January to in July (although in the south it ranges from in January to in July). Annual precipitation varies from per year.

==Politics==
During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Smolensk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Smolensk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Smolensk is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.
From July 1941-September 1943 part of region fell to Germany.

<text>Anti-Confederation was the name used in what is now the Maritimes by several parties opposed to Canadian Confederation. The Anti-Confederation parties were accordingly opposed by the Confederation Party, that is, the Conservative and Liberal-Conservative parties. 

==Nova Scotia==

In the 1867 election in Nova Scotia, Anti-Confederates won 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature, and formed a government under William Annand (See 24th General Assembly of Nova Scotia). The Anti-Confederation Party was opposed by the Confederation Party of Charles Tupper. Prominent Anti-confederates included the noted shipbuilder William D. Lawrence, Alfred William Savary and the wealthy merchant Enos Collins.

Federally, in the 1867 federal election, the Anti-Confederates won 18 of Nova Scotia&#x27;s 19 seats in the House of Commons of Canada. Joseph Howe won the federal seat in Hants County, Nova Scotia, while William D. Lawrence won the Hants County provincial seat. Britain, however, refused to allow Nova Scotia to secede.

While many anti-confederationists threatened to secede and join the United States, Howe was a pragmatist and ultimately accepted Confederation as a fact. He was soon persuaded to join the Cabinet of Sir John A. Macdonald, leading to the movement&#x27;s collapse (1869).

==New Brunswick==

There was also an &quot;Anti-Confederation Party&quot; in New Brunswick led by Albert James Smith, whose coalition of Conservatives and Reformers won the 1865 election. It was, however, soundly defeated in the 1866 election by the Confederation Party led by Peter Mitchell. The legislature that resulted from that election approved Confederation by a margin of 38 to 1. Accordingly, in the 1867 federal election the &quot;Anti-Confederates&quot; did not win any of New Brunswick&#x27;s fifteen seats in the House of Commons of Canada.

While in Nova Scotia and elsewhere, opponents of confederation were predominantly Liberals and supporters were predominantly Tories, in New Brunswick the debate blurred party lines. Anti-Confederate leader Albert Smith and Confederate Peter Mitchell were both Conservatives, while one of the most prominent leaders of the pro-Confederation forces, Samuel Leonard Tilley, was a Liberal. Tilley later joined the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. Both Anti-Confederate and Confederate forces were mixtures of Tories and Reformers (Liberals).

By 1870, the Confederate and Anti-Confederate parties had dissolved and were replaced by the old Liberal and Tory parties.

<text>Ryazan Oblast (, ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). Its administrative center is the city of Ryazan, which is also the oblast&#x27;s largest city.

==Geography==
Ryazan Oblast borders Vladimir Oblast (N), Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (NE), the Republic of Mordovia (E), Penza Oblast (SE), Tambov Oblast (S), Lipetsk Oblast (SW), Tula Oblast (W), and Moscow Oblast (NW).

In terms of physical geography, Ryazan Oblast lies in the central part of the Russian Plain between the Central Russian and Volga uplands. The terrain is flat, with the highest point of no more than 300 m above sea level. Soils are podzolic and boggy on the left bank of the Oka, changing southward to more fertile podzolic and leached black-earths (chernozyom).

===Hydrography===
Most of the Ryazan Oblast lies within the Volga basin, with the Oka the principal river of the area.

==History==
Human occupation of the area of the Ryazan Oblast dates from at least the Upper Paleolithic period. East Slavs, Volga Finnic, Tatar tribes inhabited the area and merged into an ethnos, a process virtually completed by the 13th century CE. In 830 the Ryazan area became part of Rus&#x27; Khaganate.

Later the Ryazan area became part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; political system and came under the domination of the Principality of Chernigov (founded in 988). The Principality of Ryazan operated as a separate entity from 1097 to 1521, when the area became part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, though with the Qasim Khanate district retaining some autonomy until the 1550s.

The Ryazan Governorate became separate from the Moscow Governorate in 1796.

=== Soviet Union ===
Ryazan Oblast was formed out of the Moscow and Voronezh oblasts in 1937. It took its present form in 1954 when some of its southern districts were ceded to the newly established Lipetsk Oblast. Also in 1954, it was ceded parts of southern Moscow Oblast and no border changes happened afterward.

==Administrative divisions==
== Economy ==
=== Soviet Union ===
In the post-war period of the Soviet Union recovery in the wake of growing competition between USSR and US several ambitious plans severely undermined the economic stability of the region. In Ryazan Oblast, at the behest of central government led by Nikita Khrushchev, a regional administration ordered slaughter of livestock in a futile attempt to boost productivity rates (plans included tripling of meat and milk production). Because of series of misjudgement and overestimations these plans resulted in disastrous failure which is known today as Ryazan miracle ().

=== Modern ===

Ryazan Oblast is a part of the Central economic region. The oblast is economically favorable due to the water and land routes that pass through it and provide stable domestic and foreign economic ties. It is considered both an industrial and agricultural Oblast. The agriculture in the region is represented by livestock farming and plants cultivation. Livestock farming specializes in raising and fattening cattle and breeding pigs, sheep, and poultry. Beekeeping is also well developed in the region.

==History==

In the 12th century, chronicles mention Mtsensk, known as Novosil then. Then modern Orlovschina was part of the Chernigov Principality. After the death of Mikhail of Chernigov Novosil Principality was formed on these territories. By the end of the 15th century it had disintegrated into four separate principalities and, along with all the other fragments of the Chernigov principality, became a part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 16th century, the fortress town of Oryol was founded, and the town of Livny, destroyed in the 13th century, was restored. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the territory of modern Oryol was the borderland of the Tsardom of Russia, with many fortifications of the Great Abatis Line . With the reduction of the threat posed by the Tatars, agricultural activity of the area had intensified.
It was created in 1937 by uniting a selection of territories of three other oblasts: Kursk Oblast, Western Oblast, and Voronezh Oblast. It also included present Bryansk Oblast between 1937 and 1944.
In 1941-3 The Region was partly or fully occupied by Germany.

==Politics==

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Oryol CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Oryol Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Oryol Oblast Council of People&#x27;s Deputies is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor of Oryol Oblast, who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

The head of administration of Oryol Oblast between 1993 and 2009 was Yegor Stroyev. Stroyev led the region for more than 20 years. In 1985 he became the first secretary of the regional committee of the CPSU, and after three years (in 1989-1991 he worked as secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU), in 1991 he returned to Oryol, worked as the director of the Institute of Horticultural Crops Selection, and later was elected governor. On February 16, 2009 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accepted Stroyev&#x27;s voluntary retirement and nominated Alexander Kozlov as his replacement, which was approved by the Oryol Regional Council of People&#x27;s Deputies.

===Legislature===
The Oryol Oblast Council of People&#x27;s Deputies is a permanent representative and legislative body of state power in the Oryol Oblast. It consists of 50 deputies elected by residents of the region for 5 year terms according to a mixed-member proportional representation: 25 deputies according to party lists (proportional representation) and 25 in single-mandate constituencies (majoritarian representation) on the basis of universal equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot.

The current 7th Council of People&#x27;s Deputies was elected in the 2021 Russian regional elections and will last until 2026. Of the 50 deputies, 27 are from United Russia, 11 from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 6 from A Just Russia – For Truth, 3 from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, 1 from New People, 1 from the Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice, and 1 independent.

<doc id="480959" wikidata="Q2010002" url="?curid=480959" title="12P/Pons–Brooks">
<text>is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 71 years. Comets with an orbital period of 20–200 years are referred to as Halley-type comets. It is one of the brightest known periodic comets, reaching an absolute visual magnitude of about 5 in its approach to perihelion. Comet Pons–Brooks was conclusively discovered at Marseilles Observatory in July 1812 by Jean-Louis Pons, and on its next appearance in 1883 by William Robert Brooks. However it has been confirmed was observed before the 19th century.

The last perihelion passage was 21 April 2024, with closest approach to Earth being on 2 June 2024. During the 2024 apparition the comet brightened to a magnitude of 3.8. The comet nucleus is estimated to be around 30 km in diameter, assuming it was not producing too much dust and gas during the 2020 photometric measurements.

 is hypothesized to be the parent body of the weak December  Draconids meteor shower that is active from about 29 November to 13 December.

== Observational history ==
=== Before 1812 ===
Comet has been identified as a comet observed in 1385 and in 1457. The 1385 apparition was very favourable and the comet was recorded by the Chinese in Ming Shilu and was also mentioned in some European sources. A comet observed by Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli in January 1457 and mentioned in Chinese sources is also identified as comet In both apparitions the comet had magnitude 3 or brighter, not accounting for possible outbursts. It is possible that it was also a comet recorded in Chinese sources in September 245 CE.

So-Yeon Park &amp; Jong-Chul Chae (2007) suggested that comet was also the comets recorded in Asian sources in 1313 and 1668. However, Meyer &quot;et al.&quot; argue that in the 1313 apparition, the comet would have been difficult to observe, being dim and close to the Sun, while the suggested position in Gemini contradicts the calculated location of comet Pons–Brooks in Aries. The March 1668 comet described by Koreans is probably the bright sungrazing comet observed by Europeans, whose orbit is no way compatible with that of comet 

=== 1812 discovery ===

Comet was discovered on 12 July 1812, by Jean-Louis Pons. Independently, this comet was later found by Vincent Wisniewski on 1 August, and Alexis Bouvard on 2 August the same year. The comet was spotted with the naked eye on 13 August and by the end of the month a tail measuring 2 degrees in length was reported. Shortly after its initial discovery it was found to have an orbital period of about 70 years with an error of about 5 years. Johann Franz Encke determined a definitive orbit with a period of 70.68 years. This orbit was used to generate an ephemeris for the 1883–1884 return.

=== 1884 ===
On 2 September 1883 a (faint) comet was accidentally discovered by William Robert Brooks and later identified with the comet of 1812. An outburst was observed on 21–23 September 1883, as the comet brightened from magnitude 10–11 to 8–8.5, and its appearance changed from diffuse to star-like.
The comet became visible with naked eye in 20 November and brightened up to magnitude 3. The comet was reported to experience outbursts on 1 January and 19 January. This year it traveled from Scheat and Markab in western Pegasus, 13 January 1884; southward (through Pisces) to reach perihelion below Iota and Beta Ceti (~RA 0h, dec. −10°) around 24 January. It was last seen in June 1884.

=== 1954 ===
The comet was recovered on 20 June 1953 when it was 4.5 AU from the Sun. The comet outburst from magnitude 18 to magnitude 13 on 1 July 1953. Another outburst occurred in March 1954, the fourth observed in that apparition. On 23 April the comet was estimated magnitude 6.4, and its tail was half a degree long. Pons–Brooks came to perihelion on 22 May 1954 when it was from Earth. After perihelion it became better visible from the south hemisphere. It was last observed on 4 September 1954 when it was from the Sun.
On 10 December 1954, the meteor stream of comet Pons–Brooks passed about from Earth, resulting in potential meteors impacting Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at relative velocity 45 km/s.

=== 2024 passage ===

On 10 June 2020 Pons–Brooks was recovered at apparent magnitude 23 by the Lowell Discovery Telescope when the comet was beyond the orbit of Saturn at from the Sun, with the uncertainty in the comet&#x27;s heliocentric distance being roughly at the time. The comet underwent 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from 4.26 au to 0.85 au.
After perihelion, two additional outbursts were observed in summer 2024, at heliocentric distances of 1.20 au and 2.26 au. 
The coma had expanded to a diameter of 600,000 kilometers by 5 August, having an expansion rate of 220 m/s. Although initially spherical, the coma became asymmetrical due to the effects of radiation pressure on the dust.
The comet outburst again on 5 October 2023 from magnitude 15 to magnitude 11 (brightening by ~40×). Two more outbursts were recorded on 1 November and 14 November, with the comet brightening to apparent magnitude 9.3 after the later.
Outbursts were also observed on 14 December
and 18 January 2024.

By mid February the comet had brightened to magnitude 7.5 and had developed an ion tail about two degrees long that featured jets and filaments.
A minor outburst took place on 29 February, with the comet brightening by 0.9 magnitudes.
By 7 March the comet had brightened to magnitude 5.5 and was located about 10 degrees from the Andromeda Galaxy. In the following days the comet was reported to be visible by naked eye and featured a tail about 5 degrees long. Another outburst occurred on April 3, with the comet brightening to a magnitude of about 3.8.
There was a solar eclipse on 8 April 2024 with the comet 25 degrees from the Sun.
The perihelion passage was on 21 April 2024 at from the Sun with a velocity with respect to the Sun of 47.1 km/s.
The closest approach to Earth was later on 2 June 2024 when it was from Earth.
Near perihelion passage the comet was expected to brighten to about magnitude 4.5 (around 400× brighter than the July 2023 outburst). In early June Earth crossed the comet&#x27;s orbital plane, resulting to an anti-tail becoming visible.

== Orbit ==
Libration is locked at a 6:1 resonance with Jupiter. The Tisserand invariant with respect to Jupiter (&quot;J&quot;) is 0.60. Aphelion (furthest point from the Sun) is just beyond the orbit of Neptune at .

With a steep orbital inclination of 74.2° this comet does not spend a lot of time near the ecliptic. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory&#x27;s (JPL) website shows that between the years 1900 and 2200, that the comet was and will be most significantly perturbed by Saturn on July 29, 1957. At that point it passed within 1.6AU of the giant planet&#x27;s influence; even this approach had negligible effect. The comet&#x27;s orbit appears to be stable between 1740 and 2167, with no strong perturbations by any of the planets.
Before the 2020 recovery, while the last observation was in 1954, Kinoshita calculated that the comet would come to a future perihelion passage (closest approach to the Sun) on 10 August 2095. Accounting for observations in 2020–2023, the nominal time of perihelion passage is now calculated to be 15 August 2095.

Kirkwood in 1884 noticed that Pons–Brooks shares elements with De Vico&#x27;s comet of 1846. He suggested that the latter had calved off Pons–Brooks some centuries prior. Later he identified the two comets&#x27; capture into their elliptical orbits (or their parent body&#x27;s capture) with their shared aphelion close to Neptune 991 CE.

Other comets with a similar orbital period include 13P/Olbers, 23P/Brorsen–Metcalf, and 1P/Halley.

== Meteor showers ==
 is hypothesized to be the parent body of the weak December  Draconids meteor shower (#336) that is active from about 29 November to 13 December and generates less than 2 meteors/hour. This is the most abundant of the meteor showers predicted to be related to the comet. One more nighttime meteor shower has been tentatively associated with the northern June Aquilids, although most probably isn&#x27;t the parent body. Comet Pons–Brooks could also be the source of a meteor shower on Venus, along with periodic comets and

<doc id="480975" wikidata="Q1439828" url="?curid=480975" title="Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies">
<text>The Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) was an informal collaboration of academics devoted to Latter-day Saint historical scholarship. The organization was established in 1979 as a non-profit organization by John. W. Welch. In 1997, the group became a formal part of Brigham Young University (BYU), which is owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 2006, the group became a formal part of the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship, formerly known as the Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts, BYU. FARMS has since been absorbed into the Maxwell Institute&#x27;s Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies.

FARMS supported and sponsored what it considered to be &quot;faithful scholarship&quot;, which includes academic study and research in support of Christianity and Mormonism, and in particular, the official position of the LDS Church. This research primarily concerned the Book of Mormon, the Book of Abraham, the Old Testament, the New Testament, early Christian history, ancient temples, and other related subjects. While allowing some degree of academic freedom to its scholars, FARMS was committed to the conclusion that LDS scriptures are authentic, historical texts written by prophets of God. FARMS has been criticized by scholars and critics who classify it as an apologetics organization that operated under the auspices of the LDS Church.

==History==

FARMS was organized by John W. Welch in California in 1979 as a private, not-for-profit educational organization, and Welch brought the foundation with him when he came to teach at BYU in 1980. In 1997, FARMS was invited to become part of BYU by Gordon B. Hinckley, LDS Church president and chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. Hinckley noted: &quot;FARMS represents the efforts of sincere and dedicated scholars. It has grown to provide strong support and defense of the Church on a professional basis. I wish to express my strong congratulations and appreciation for those who started this effort and who have shepherded it to this point.&quot;

In 2001, BYU consolidated FARMS with the Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (CPART) and the Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI) to form the Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (ISPART). In 2006, ISPART was renamed as the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship. Welch was tasked with editing BYU Studies, which was originally slated to join the Maxwell Institute with FARMS. BYU Studies did not ultimately join the Maxwell Institute, however, and Welch&#x27;s role with FARMS diminished. FARMS continued as a nominal sub-unit of the Maxwell Institute without a distinctive cluster of BYU faculty and staff. It has since been subsumed into the Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies, which &quot;deals principally with the Book of Mormon in ancient and modern settings, as well as with the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and related subjects.&quot;

As of 2013, M. Gerald Bradford was the director of the Maxwell Institute, with Brian M. Hauglid as the director of the Willes Center.

In late 2010, Daniel C. Peterson, editor of the &quot;FARMS Review&quot; for over twenty years, announced the journal would be renamed &quot;Mormon Studies Review&quot; to reflect &quot;readjustments over the past several years in what is now known as the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship; the old title, FARMS, no longer reflects the way we&#x27;re organized. ... We look forward to continuing under the new name.&quot; In mid-2012, the director of the Maxwell Institute removed Peterson from editorship of the &quot;Review&quot;. Peterson retained his title of editor-in-chief of the Institute&#x27;s Middle Eastern Texts Initiative until resigning from that post in September 2013. In March 2013, J. Spencer Fluhman was named as the new editor of the &quot;Mormon Studies Review&quot;, along with a new board featuring a variety of scholars interested in Mormon studies.

==Peer review and scholarly credentials==

Work produced under FARMS&#x27;s auspices has been critiqued by Mormons, ex-Mormons, secular scholars, and evangelical Christians.

FARMS has stated that the work it supported &quot;conforms to established canons of scholarship, is peer reviewed, and reflects solely the views of individual authors and editors.&quot; John A. Tvedtnes, formerly with FARMS and now retired, claims that &quot;the academic credentials of people who publish with FARMS are questioned only by the critics, never by bona fide scholars,&quot; noting that &quot;[t]he list of articles and books published in non-LDS scholarly presses by FARMS authors is impressive indeed. If the critics do not accept FARMS authors as scholars, those authors are at least so acknowledged by the world&#x27;s scholarly community.&quot;

Two evangelical Christian scholars, Carl Mosser and Paul Owen, examined the scholarship produced by FARMS. Their subsequent report at the April 25, 1997, Far West Annual Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society, praised the high quality of FARMS&#x27; scholarship, concluding that their fellow evangelicals had lost the apologetic battle against the Mormons largely due to excellent research and publication by FARMS.

==Apologetics==

FARMS was an important center for producing work that analyzed the Book of Mormon as an ancient text. It also produced work which critiqued claims by both Mormon enthusiasts, disaffected Mormons, and opponents from evangelical Christianity. Such work has been published in the &quot;FARMS Review&quot; until 2010, when it was replaced by &quot;Mormon Studies Review&quot;.

Scholars such as John L. Sorenson say that the publications of FARMS represented a new trend within Mormonism: the emergence of progressive forms of Mormon orthodoxy. While its scholars are committed to literal interpretations of Mormon faith claims, they are willing to rethink traditional understandings of those claims. For example, FARMS has published a limited geography model for the Book of Mormon. This suggests that the events chronicled in the Book of Mormon occurred in a much smaller region than the traditional understanding, which argues the same events occurred across the entire Western hemisphere. Sorenson writes that supporters of the limited geography idea, including some high-ranking church leaders, believe this model is consistent with anthropological, archaeological and genetic findings about indigenous peoples in the Americas, as well as with the text of the Book of Mormon.

==Controversies==

FARMS has also been a focus of some controversy both inside and outside the Mormon community, often in response to negative critiques of the works of various scholars. For instance, after his work was reviewed in a FARMS publication, molecular biologist Simon Southerton, a former member of the LDS Church and author of &quot;Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church,&quot; claimed the organization existed merely to &quot;prop up faith in the Book of Mormon&quot; and that its work &quot;stretched the bounds of credibility to breaking point on almost every critical issue.&quot;

=== Polemics ===

Some have accused FARMS of engaging in mean-spirited polemics. One example of this occurred with Signature Books&#x27; publication of Grant H. Palmer&#x27;s book &quot;An Insider&#x27;s View of Mormon Origins&quot;. The publication of this book immediately resulted in five negative book reviews by FARMS. Ron Priddis of Signature Books responded to these reviews by stating: &quot;Is nothing beyond the reach of sarcasm by FARMS polemicists?&quot; Priddis refers to the book reviews by FARMS as &quot;tabloid scholarship.&quot;

Some authors associated with FARMS have been accused of making ad hominem attacks. FARMS has also been criticized for employing the label &quot;anti-Mormon&quot;, and then discounting such works as biased based largely on this pronouncement. In a speech offered before the Sunstone Symposium (titled &quot;Why I No Longer Trust the FARMS Review of Books&quot;), John Hatch said, &quot;After reading the (FARMS) reviews myself, it appears to me, and is my opinion, that FARMS is interested in making Mormonism&#x27;s past appear as normal as possible to readers by attacking history books that discuss complex or difficult aspects of the church&#x27;s past. As one who hopes to some day contribute to the body of the New Mormon History, I am deeply troubled by what I see as continued efforts to attack honest scholarly work.&quot;

==Publications==

The following periodicals were published under the FARMS imprint, which was phased out as FARMS was absorbed into BYU&#x27;s Neal A. Maxwell Institute.

FARMS has republished much work by the LDS scholar Hugh Nibley in the 19-volume &quot;Collected Works of Hugh Nibley&quot;. It has also published other books, as well as audio and video recordings.

<text>Magadan Oblast is a federal subject (an oblast) of Russia. It is geographically located in the Far East region of the country, and is administratively part of the Far Eastern Federal District. Magadan Oblast has a population of 136,085 (2021 Census), making it the least populated oblast and the third-least populated federal subject in Russia.

Magadan is the largest city and the capital of Magadan Oblast with the majority of the oblast&#x27;s inhabitants living in the city itself. The coastline has a less severe climate than the interiors, although both are very cold for its latitude.

It borders Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the north, Kamchatka Krai in the east, Khabarovsk Krai in the south and the Sakha Republic in the west. The economy is primarily based on mining, particularly gold, silver and other non-ferrous metals.

==History==
Magadan Oblast was established on December 3, 1953 in what had popularly been known as Kolyma. As a result of considerable raw resources, especially gold, silver, tin, and tungsten deposits, mining activities and road building had been developed during the Stalin era in the 1930s and 1940s under the coordination of Dalstroy and its forced labor camps. Upon Stalin&#x27;s death, Dalstroy was disbanded and the regional administration took over many of its former responsibilities.

From then on, paid labor replaced most of the convict-based manpower, attracted by the region&#x27;s rapid economic expansion, especially the gold-mining interests.

The indigenous peoples of the region, including the Evens, Koryaks, Yupiks, Chukchis, Orochs, Chuvans and Itelmens, who had traditionally lived from fishing along the Sea of Okhotsk coast or from reindeer herding in the River Kolyma valley, suffered from the industrialization of the area but were able to rely on institutional support until 1987 when Perestroika started to cause many of the older structures to close. As a result, many of those who can no longer rely on traditional sources of income are now unemployed.

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug was formerly administratively subordinated to Magadan Oblast, but declared its separation in 1991.

On 4 July 1997, Magadan, alongside Bryansk, Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Vologda signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement would be abolished on 30 January 2002.

==Geography==


Magadan Oblast consists principally of mountainous desert, tundra, and taiga. The southern part of the region is partly forested with birch, willow, mountain ash, larch and alder.

Inland there are mountain ranges belonging to the Kolyma Mountains, as well as the Chersky Range, including the Okhandya Range with the highest point of Magadan Oblast, an unnamed high peak. 
There are a number of peninsulas along the oblast&#x27;s coast, the chief ones being (north to south) the , Pyagina Peninsula, Koni Peninsula, Staritskogo Peninsula, Onatsevicha Peninsula, Khmitevskogo Peninsula and the Onara Peninsula.

The main islands of Magadan Oblast are (north to south) Telan Island, the Yam Islands, Zavyalov Island, Nedorazumeniya Island and the Spafaryev Islands.

===Wildlife===
The animal species in the south include snow sheep, reindeer, moose and brown bears. There are also many varieties of birds, including ducks and seabirds. Coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk host notable biodiversity where large vertebrates such as bowhead whales may appear, and have rich fishing grounds for pollock, herring, cod, flounder and salmon, as well as crabs and shellfish.

==Economy==
The economy is centered on mining interests for gold, silver and other non-ferrous metals. The city of Magadan is the only large industrial center. Agriculture is not well developed in the region. In April 2014 the Russian government has endorsed bills for extending the operations of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Magadan Oblast through to December 31, 2025.

===Mining===
Magadan Oblast is considered one of the world&#x27;s richest mining areas. Gold is the region&#x27;s main resource, although silver and tin deposits are also being developed. There are nearly 2,000 placer gold deposits, 100 gold ore deposits, and 48 silver ore deposits in the territory.

Recently, there has been interest in exploiting the coal resources in the region. Over the medium term, there seem to be excellent opportunities for petroleum and natural gas exploitation.

===Fishing===
The fishing industry is the region&#x27;s only food sector and is second in importance after mining. The area of the Sea of Okhotsk that borders on Magadan Oblast is one of the most productive regions of the world&#x27;s oceans. Magadan Oblast has more than of coastline and of rivers of commercial importance. The catching vessels of the oblast&#x27;s fishing companies operate mainly in Russia&#x27;s economic zone, the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, and to some extent in the Sea of Japan. Most of the catch comes from coastal waters. Fishing industry companies are concentrated in Magadan, Ola, Yamsk, and Evensk. The most important commercial fish are pollock, herring, cod, navaga (a member of the cod family), flounder, and various kinds of salmon. Crabs, squid, shrimp, and whelks are also caught.

===Agriculture===
Owing to the severe climate, agriculture is Magadan Region&#x27;s least developed economic sector; as a result, 50% of all food products must be supplied from outside. The agricultural complex consists of companies producing agricultural products, the food and processing industries, a production infrastructure, and farm enterprises. The particular areas of specialization are reindeer herding, fur farming, and traditional hunting, fishing, and fur trapping activities. Companies involved in food processing and production include Gormolzavod, a distillery, a pasta factory, a sausage factory, the Dukcha state poultry farm, and the Khasynsky state farm.

===Present situation===
Despite rich natural resources, the economy has not prospered as much as might have been expected in recent years. The severe climate and poorly developed infrastructure are partly to blame, but the difficult transition from Soviet times has led to the collapse of a number of companies with the result that many inhabitants have left the region. Recently, there does seem to have been renewed efforts to encourage foreign investment which could lead to improvements in the economy. Indeed, on a visit to Magadan in November 2005, President Vladimir Putin supported the extension of special tax advantages for the region in order to encourage gold exploitation.

===Demographics for 2006 and later===

Magadan is a federal subject that has the highest rate of depopulation in the Russian Federation. Its population, which stood at 384,525 in 1991, stood at 165,820 on January 1, 2008 (according to the State Committee of the Russian Federation on Statistics), falling at a rate of around 2% per year. The rural population, which had stood at 59,151, was just 8,833 in 2008 and decreasing at a rate of around 10% per year. Entire villages are being emptied out and the population of the rural areas of the districts is simply disappearing. The rural population of Yagodninsky District was reduced from 13,843 (1991) to 445 (2007). The Omsukchansky District saw its rural population plummet from 1,301 to 79. Especially extreme is the example of Susumansky District, where the rural population almost disappeared: from 9,764 in 1991 to just 116 in 2007. Emigration is evident from the fact that for the 20-24 age group, there were only 66 females living in rural areas, compared to 202 males. Male life expectancy for rural areas rose to 53.73 years in 2006 from 51.88 in 2005. In 2021 the depopulation continues with approximately the same rate, as the population is about 139,000 people.

Although Magadan Oblast is a part of the program of resettlement of ethnic Russian families.

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 29.6% of the population of Magadan Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 3% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 3% is an Orthodox Christian believer without belonging to any church or adheres to other Orthodox churches, 2% of the population adheres to the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery) or to Siberian shamanism, 1% to Islam, 1% to the Old Believers. In addition, 27% of the population declares itself to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 13% is atheist, and 20.4% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

<text>Little Kennesaw Mountain is a mountain in Cobb County, Georgia, northwest of Marietta and south of Kennesaw. It is a sub-peak of Kennesaw Mountain, the site of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War.

The defensive-minded Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston constructed a series of trenches from Kennesaw Mountain to Kolb Farm to prevent or delay Union general William T. Sherman&#x27;s approach towards Atlanta, Georgia. For the purpose of defending the Confederate line, the Confederates constructed Fort McBride here, but Little Kennesaw Mountain experienced only skirmishes, with most of the fighting occurring to the south. Now a part of Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, the mountain is part of a popular trail that strings from Burnt Hickory Road to the park visitor center, traversing Pigeon Hill and both mountains.

<doc id="481020" wikidata="Q1414557" url="?curid=481020" title="Nondisjunction">
<text>Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure of a pair of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).

Calvin Bridges and Thomas Hunt Morgan are credited with discovering nondisjunction in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; sex chromosomes in the spring of 1910, while working in the Zoological Laboratory of Columbia University.

==Types==
In general, nondisjunction can occur in any form of cell division that involves ordered distribution of chromosomal material. Higher animals have three distinct forms of such cell divisions: Meiosis I and meiosis II are specialized forms of cell division occurring during generation of gametes (eggs and sperm) for sexual reproduction, mitosis is the form of cell division used by all other cells of the body.

=== Meiosis II ===
Ovulated eggs become arrested in metaphase II until fertilization triggers the second meiotic division. Similar to the segregation events of mitosis, the pairs of sister chromatids resulting from the separation of bivalents in meiosis I are further separated in anaphase of meiosis II. In oocytes, one sister chromatid is segregated into the second polar body, while the other stays inside the egg. During spermatogenesis, each meiotic division is symmetric such that each primary spermatocyte gives rise to 2 secondary spermatocytes after meiosis I, and eventually 4 spermatids after meiosis II. Meiosis II-nondisjunction may also result in aneuploidy syndromes, but only to a much smaller extent than do segregation failures in meiosis I.

=== Mitosis ===
Division of somatic cells through mitosis is preceded by replication of the genetic material in S phase. As a result, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids held together at the centromere. In the anaphase of mitosis, sister chromatids separate and migrate to opposite cell poles before the cell divides. Nondisjunction during mitosis leads to one daughter receiving both sister chromatids of the affected chromosome while the other gets none. This is known as a chromatin bridge or an anaphase bridge. Mitotic nondisjunction results in somatic mosaicism, since only daughter cells originating from the cell where the nondisjunction event has occurred will have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Nondisjunction during mitosis can contribute to the development of some forms of cancer, e.g., retinoblastoma (see below). Chromosome nondisjunction in mitosis can be attributed to the inactivation of topoisomerase II, condensin, or separase. Meiotic nondisjunction has been well studied in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. This yeast undergoes mitosis similarly to other eukaryotes. Chromosome bridges occur when sister chromatids are held together post replication by DNA-DNA topological entanglement and the cohesion complex. During anaphase, cohesin is cleaved by separase. Topoisomerase II and condensin are responsible for removing catenations.

==Molecular mechanisms==

=== Central role of the spindle assembly checkpoint ===
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a molecular safe-guarding mechanism that governs proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotic cells. SAC inhibits progression into anaphase until all homologous chromosomes (bivalents, or tetrads) are properly aligned to the spindle apparatus. Only then, SAC releases its inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), which in turn irreversibly triggers progression through anaphase.

=== Sex-specific differences in meiosis ===
Surveys of cases of human aneuploidy syndromes have shown that most of them are maternally derived. This raises the question: Why is female meiosis more error prone? The most obvious difference between female oogenesis and male spermatogenesis is the prolonged arrest of oocytes in late stages of prophase I for many years up to several decades. Male gametes on the other hand quickly go through all stages of meiosis I and II. Another important difference between male and female meiosis concerns the frequency of recombination between homologous chromosomes: In the male, almost all chromosome pairs are joined by at least one crossover, while more than 10% of human oocytes contain at least one bivalent without any crossover event. Failures of recombination or inappropriately located crossovers have been well documented as contributors to the occurrence of nondisjunction in humans.

=== Age-related loss of cohesin ties ===
Due to the prolonged arrest of human oocytes, weakening of cohesive ties holding together chromosomes and reduced activity of the SAC may contribute to maternal age-related errors in segregation control. The cohesin complex is responsible for keeping together sister chromatids and provides binding sites for spindle attachment. Cohesin is loaded onto newly replicated chromosomes in oogonia during fetal development. Mature oocytes have only limited capacity for reloading cohesin after completion of S phase. The prolonged arrest of human oocytes prior to completion of meiosis I may therefore result in considerable loss of cohesin over time. Loss of cohesin is assumed to contribute to incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachment and chromosome segregation errors during meiotic divisions.

==Consequences==
The result of this error is a cell with an imbalance of chromosomes. Such a cell is said to be aneuploid. Loss of a single chromosome (2n-1), in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect will have one chromosome missing from one of its pairs, is referred to as a monosomy. Gaining a single chromosome, in which the daughter cell(s) with the defect will have one chromosome in addition to its pairs is referred to as a trisomy. In the event that an aneuploidic gamete is fertilized, a number of syndromes might result.

=== Monosomy ===
The only known survivable monosomy in humans is Turner syndrome, where the affected individual is monosomic for the X chromosome (see below). Other monosomies are usually lethal during early fetal development, and survival is only possible if not all the cells of the body are affected in case of a mosaicism (see below), or if the normal number of chromosomes is restored via duplication of the single monosomic chromosome (&quot;chromosome rescue&quot;).

==== Turner syndrome (X monosomy) (45, X0) ====
Complete loss of an entire X chromosome accounts for about half the cases of Turner syndrome. The importance of both X chromosomes during embryonic development is underscored by the observation that the overwhelming majority (&gt;99%) of fetuses with only one X chromosome (karyotype 45, X0) are spontaneously aborted.

=== Autosomal trisomy ===
The term autosomal trisomy means that a chromosome other than the sex chromosomes X and Y is present in 3 copies instead of the normal number of 2 in diploid cells.

====Down syndrome (trisomy 21)====

Down syndrome, a trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common anomaly of chromosome number in humans. The majority of cases result from nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I. Trisomy occurs in at least 0.3% of newborns and in nearly 25% of spontaneous abortions. It is the leading cause of pregnancy wastage and is the most common known cause of intellectual disability. It is well documented that advanced maternal age is associated with greater risk of meiotic nondisjunction leading to Down syndrome. This may be associated with the prolonged meiotic arrest of human oocytes potentially lasting for more than four decades.

====Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13)====
Human autosomal trisomies compatible with live birth, other than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Complete trisomies of other chromosomes are usually not viable and represent a relatively frequent cause of miscarriage. Only in rare cases of a mosaicism, the presence of a normal cell line, in addition to the trisomic cell line, may support the development of a viable trisomy of the other chromosomes.

=== Sex chromosome aneuploidy ===
The term &quot;sex chromosome aneuploidy&quot; summarizes conditions with an abnormal number of sex chromosomes, i.e., other than XX (female) or XY (male). Formally, X chromosome monosomy (Turner syndrome, see above) can also be classified as a form of sex chromosome aneuploidy.

==== Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) ====
Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy in humans. It represents the most frequent cause of hypogonadism and infertility in men. Most cases are caused by nondisjunction errors in paternal meiosis I. About eighty percent of individuals with this syndrome have one extra X chromosome resulting in the karyotype XXY. The remaining cases have either multiple additional sex chromosomes (48,XXXY; 48,XXYY; 49,XXXXY), mosaicism (46,XY/47,XXY), or structural chromosome abnormalities.

==== XYY Male (47, XYY) ====
The incidence of XYY syndrome is approximately 1 in 800–1000 male births. Many cases remain undiagnosed because of their normal appearance and fertility, and the absence of severe symptoms. The extra Y chromosome is usually a result of nondisjunction during paternal meiosis II.

==== Trisomy X (47,XXX) ====
Trisomy X is a form of sex chromosome aneuploidy where females have three instead of two X chromosomes. Most patients are only mildly affected by neuropsychological and physical symptoms. Studies examining the origin of the extra X chromosome observed that about 58–63% of cases were caused by nondisjunction in maternal meiosis I, 16–18% by nondisjunction in maternal meiosis II, and the remaining cases by post-zygotic, i.e., mitotic, nondisjunction.

=== Uniparental disomy ===
Uniparental disomy denotes the situation where both chromosomes of a chromosome pair are inherited from the same parent and are therefore identical. This phenomenon most likely is the result of a pregnancy that started as a trisomy due to nondisjunction. Since most trisomies are lethal, the fetus only survives because it loses one of the three chromosomes and becomes disomic. Uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 is, for example, seen in some cases of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.

=== Mosaicism syndromes ===
Mosaicism syndromes can be caused by mitotic nondisjunction in early fetal development. As a consequence, the organism evolves as a mixture of cell lines with differing ploidy (number of chromosomes). Mosaicism may be present in some tissues, but not in others. Affected individuals may have a patchy or asymmetric appearance. Examples of mosaicism syndromes include Pallister-Killian syndrome and Hypomelanosis of Ito.

=== Mosaicism in malignant transformation ===
Development of cancer often involves multiple alterations of the cellular genome (Knudson hypothesis). Human retinoblastoma is a well studied example of a cancer type where mitotic nondisjunction can contribute to malignant transformation: Mutations of the RB1 gene, which is located on chromosome 13 and encodes the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, can be detected by cytogenetic analysis in many cases of retinoblastoma. Mutations of the RB1 locus in one copy of chromosome 13 are sometimes accompanied by loss of the other wild-type chromosome 13 through mitotic nondisjunction. By this combination of lesions, affected cells completely lose expression of functioning tumor suppressor protein.

==Diagnosis==

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis===
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is a technique used to identify genetically normal embryos and is useful for couples who have a family history of genetic disorders. This is an option for people choosing to procreate through IVF. PGD is considered difficult due to it being both time consuming and having success rates only comparable to routine IVF.

===Karyotyping===
Karyotyping involves performing an amniocentesis in order to study the cells of an unborn fetus during metaphase 1. Light microscopy can be used to visually determine if aneuploidy is an issue.

===Polar body diagnosis===
Polar body diagnosis (PBD) can be used to detect maternally derived chromosomal aneuploidies as well as translocations in oocytes. The advantage of PBD over PGD is that it can be accomplished in a short amount of time. This is accomplished through zona drilling or laser drilling.

===Blastomere biopsy===
Blastomere biopsy is a technique in which blastomeres are removed from the zona pellucida. It is commonly used to detect aneuploidy. Genetic analysis is conducted once the procedure is complete. Additional studies are needed to assess the risk associated with the procedure.

==Lifestyle/environmental hazards==
Exposure of spermatozoa to lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards may increase the risk of aneuploidy. Cigarette smoke is a known aneugen (aneuploidy inducing agent). It is associated with increases in aneuploidy ranging from 1.5 to 3.0-fold. Other studies indicate factors such as alcohol consumption, occupational exposure to benzene, and exposure to the insecticides fenvalerate and carbaryl also increase aneuploidy.

<doc id="481033" wikidata="Q646511" url="?curid=481033" title="Sugarcult">
<text>Sugarcult was an American rock band from Santa Barbara, California, formed in 1998. The band consisted of Tim Pagnotta (vocals, rhythm guitar), Airin Older (bass), Marko DeSantis (lead guitar), and Kenny Livingston (drums).

==History==
===Formation (1998-99)===
Tim Pagnotta met ex-drummer Ben Davis during a cigarette break at school. Davis (who then played bass) and Pagnotta started to play together on a regular basis. Pagnotta met Airin Older in a music class where Pagnotta was copying Older&#x27;s work. They became good friends and Pagnotta invited Older to join his band. Davis moved to the position of drummer and Older filled in for Davis on bass. Marko DeSantis was added into the band after meeting Pagnotta backstage at a Superdrag concert.

===Early releases (1999–2003)===
Sugarcult released their first collection of demo recordings, &quot;Eleven&quot;, in 1999. Their second collection, &quot;Wrap Me Up in Plastic&quot;, was released in 2000. In 2001, the band released their debut album, &quot;Start Static&quot;, which featured the hit singles &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;, &quot;Bouncing Off The Walls&quot; (also featured in the movie and soundtrack to &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder&quot;) and &quot;Stuck in America&quot;. In early 2003, &quot;Stuck in America&quot; won the Los Angeles Regional Poll in The 2nd Annual Independent Music Awards. &quot;Start Static&quot; featured several songs that had previously been released as demos on &quot;Wrap Me Up in Plastic&quot;. In May 2001, the band re-released &quot;Wrap Me Up in Plastic&quot; with a new track listing that included songs from both &quot;Eleven&quot; and the original &quot;Wrap Me Up in Plastic&quot;, as well as new artwork. In 2003, Davis officially left Sugarcult. Davis had been regularly missing shows since the release of &quot;Start Static&quot;, and left Sugarcult to enter rehab to get help for his alcoholism. Pagnotta was close to Davis, and wrote the song &quot;Champagne&quot; about his addictions when he was forced to leave the band.

===Later releases (2004–2008)===
On April 13, 2004, Sugarcult released &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; and performed on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. This album featured the MTV hits &quot;Memory&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s the Blade&quot;. Sugarcult successfully landed a spot on the Warped Tour 2004 main stage and they also supported Green Day on their American Idiot tour and Blink-182 on their December 2004 European tour. They released &quot;Back to the Disaster&quot;, a feature-length documentary film (with a bonus live EP), in late 2005. &quot;Lights Out&quot;, their latest studio album, was released on September 12, 2006. The release of &quot;Lights Out&quot; was immediately followed by two tours, a fall tour and a winter tour. Their fall tour included So They Say, Maxeen, Halifax, and The Spill Canvas. Their winter tour included such bands as Meg and Dia, Damone, The Pink Spiders, All Time Low, and The Adored. In 2006, Sugarcult song &quot;Do It Alone&quot; was featured on the CW&#x27;s show &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; during Season and in the film &quot;Employee of the Month&quot;. Sugarcult played at the Soundwave Tour in 2008.

===Hiatus and occasional shows (2009–present)===
The band members took a year off in 2009 from Sugarcult for their 10-year anniversary to do their own side-projects. They were neither broken up, nor were known to be working on new Sugarcult material as of mid-2010.

At the end of 2010, they announced that they would play at least two shows in the United Kingdom and then perform at the Belgium music festival Groezrock, all at the end of April.

Sugarcult (with Davis) played a one-off show at the Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California on December 10, 2011, where they celebrated the tenth anniversary of the release of &quot;Start Static&quot;. More recently, members of the group performed with members of 5 Seconds of Summer (who have cited Sugarcult as a primary influence on their band) and past tourmate Goldfinger frontman and acclaimed record producer John Feldmann for Strange &#x27;80s, a benefit concert on May 14, 2017, at the Fonda Theatre.

<doc id="481038" wikidata="Q598058" url="?curid=481038" title="Wetter, Hesse">
<text>Wetter (Hessen) () is a small town in Hesse, Germany. The rather unusual designation Wetter ([[Hesse-Nassau|Hessen-Nassau]]) stems from a time when the town belonged to the Prussian province of the same name, and nowadays is only used by the railway – even today, the railway station in town bears this name.

==Geography==
Wetter lies in the Marburg-Biedenkopf district on the western edge of the &quot;Burgwald&quot;, a low range of hills, in the Wetschaft valley and neighbouring places about 14 km north of Marburg.

===Neighbouring communities===
To the north, Wetter borders on the town of Rosenthal in Waldeck-Frankenberg district, to the east on the town of Rauschenberg and the community of Cölbe, to the south on the community of Lahntal, to the southwest on the community of Dautphetal, and to the southwest on the town of Biedenkopf and the community of Münchhausen am Christenberg, all in the Marburg-Biedenkopf district.

==Transport==
North to south through the town&#x27;s municipal area runs the Federal Highway (&quot;Bundesstraße&quot;) B 252 from eastern Westphalia by way of Korbach and Frankenberg and on to Göttingen (in the community of Lahntal). To divert heavy traffic away from places in the Wetschaft valley, a bypass road is planned.

The &quot;Burgwaldbahn&quot; railway line connects the town with Marburg and Frankenberg. The &quot;Kurhessenbahn&quot; which runs the line means to reopen the extension between Frankenberg and Korbach.

==History==

Wetter was already being mentioned in documents in the 8th and 9th centuries; it was mentioned in one such document under the same name that it still has today in 1108, and the &quot;&quot;Weistum&quot; of Wetter&quot; was already displaying its town rights even as early as 1239.

==Politics==

===Town council===

As of municipal elections held on 26 March 2006, the seats on Wetter Town Council are apportioned thus:
===Coat of arms===
Wetter&#x27;s civic coat of arms might be described thus: In Or on a three-knolled hill vert a fleur-de-lis twig vert with three blossoms argent flanked by two inescutcheons, dexter in azure the Hessian Lion rampant gules and argent sinister; sinister in gules the wheel of Mainz argent.

The two inescutcheons (smaller shields within the main one) hark back to the time when the Hessian Landgraves held sway (the Hessian Lion), and to the Archbishops of Mainz (the wheel of Mainz).

==Constituent communities==

* Amönau
* Mellnau
* Niederwetter
* Oberndorf
* Oberrosphe
* Todenhausen
* Treisbach
* Unterrosphe
* Warzenbach
* Wetter

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===
*The Gothic monastery church (13th century).
*Town Hall – in the upper floors slated half-timbering with a spire skylight, built about 1680. The ground floor is massive. Recently expanded.
*Former synagogue – (once a storeroom, since renovated and turned into an event room). Two-floor square half-timbered building with polygonal ridge turret, late 19th century.
*Houses – The compact and picturesque townscape consists first and foremost of half-timbered houses with forward-facing gables, most of which have slate roofs or plasterwork. After several town fires, only a few buildings from before 1629 have still been preserved. Some houses exhibit Classicist doors.
*Remains of the mediaeval town wall with two towers.

The houses at the following addresses are worth mentioning:
*Markt 7 – Three-floor house with forward-facing gable and a corner oriel window. On the stone ground floor a pretty Renaissance portal, marked 1570.
*Markt 8 – 17th century.
*Markt 9 – Three-floor house with forward-facing gable, presumably from the first third of the 16th century, second upper floor added about 1700.
*Markt 14 – Baroque half-timbered building with ornamental carvings, presumably from the late 17th century.
*Krämergasse 14 – House with side gables with carved infilling boards, dated 1671.
*Krämergasse 10 – Two-floor half-timbered building, possibly from first quarter of the 16th century.

===Regular events===
Every seven years, the town holds its &quot;Grenzgangfest&quot;, recalling a time when patrolling the town&#x27;s boundaries was necessary to prevent neighbourly encroachment. The next &quot;Grenzgangfest&quot; &quot; is in 2029.

===Sons and daughters of the town===

* Friedrich Sylburg (1536-1596), publisher
* Johannes Cuchlinus (1546-1606), pastor and founding regent of the theological college at Leiden University 
* Hermann Vultejus (1555–1634), German jurist 
* Oswald Croll (1560-1608), physician and pharmacist
* Fred Steinfort (born 1952), American Football player

<text>Jennifer Government is a 2003 dystopian novel by Max Barry, set in an alternate reality where most nations in the Americas and Oceania are dominated by powerful corporations and corporate libertarianism coalitions, and where government power is extremely limited. It was a finalist for a Campbell Award, and was included in &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; annual list of notable books. The novel was retitled from &quot;Jennifer Government&quot; to Logoland in its German and Italian editions. In its Brazilian edition it was retitled to &quot;EU S/A&quot;, an abbreviation of Estados Unidos Sociedade Anônima, which roughly translates to &quot;United States, Inc.&quot;

To help promote the novel, Barry created a browser game titled &quot;Jennifer Government: NationStates&quot; (later shortened to &quot;NationStates&quot;). In the game, players make choices which are inspired by the novel and which affect the economy, society, and culture of their countries. &quot;NationStates&quot; launched alongside the book and remains active as of 2025.

==Plot==
In the alternate present the novel portrays, the United States has taken over all of North and South America (except for Cuba) and dominates much of the rest of the world. The United States adopts &quot;capitalizm&quot;, a form of minarchy that abolishes taxation and privatizes government. 

People take the names of the corporations that employ them as their surnames, and persons with two jobs hyphenate their name, e.g. &quot;Julia Nike-McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. Employees of the government, including the novel&#x27;s title character, take the surname Government. 

John Nike, Vice President of Guerrilla Marketing, contracts Hack Nike, a clumsy and naïve low-level-employee, to execute an ambitious and unethical secret marketing scheme. John plans to increase interest in the upcoming Nike Mercury shoes by having Hack kill people who try to buy them, intending to make the shoes appear so desirable that customers are killing each other to acquire them. Hack signs the contract without reading it. When he finds out that it requires him to commit murder, he subcontracts the scheme to the Police, now a mercenary organisation, in an attempt to keep his job (which requires fulfilling the contract) without having to take responsibility for murder.

After several children are murdered at various Nike stores on opening day, Jennifer Government takes it upon herself to track down the perpetrators, even if she cannot get the funding for her investigation. One of the murdered children bought the shoes with money given to her by Buy Mitsui, a French stockbroker flush with money after recent professional success. Feeling personally responsible for the girl&#x27;s death, Buy joins forces with Jennifer.

At the same time, Violet (Hack&#x27;s girlfriend) creates a dangerous computer virus, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. She succeeds in selling it to ExxonMobil. Her handlers take her all over the world to exploit the virus&#x27;s power, but never pay her for it. Angered, Violet turns to John Nike, who promises to help her revenge herself on ExxonMobil. In exchange, John demands that Violet kidnap Kate, Jennifer Government&#x27;s daughter, intending to use her as leverage to deter Jennifer&#x27;s investigation.

Hack Nike is fired and founds an anti-corporate activist group in order to take revenge on John Nike. Hack and Jennifer Government succeed in rescuing Kate and arresting John.

==Attempted film adaptation==
Barry optioned film rights for &quot;Jennifer Government&quot; to Section 8, a production company owned by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney early in the book&#x27;s life. In 2005, Louis Mellis and Dave Scinto, writers of &quot;Sexy Beast&quot;, were chosen by Soderbergh and Clooney to write the screenplay. However, with the closure of Section 8 in 2006, the film rights returned to Barry.

<doc id="481048" wikidata="Q738534" url="?curid=481048" title="Tufted titmouse">
<text>The tufted titmouse (&quot;Baeolophus bicolor)&quot; is a small songbird native to eastern North America, a species in the tit and chickadee family (Paridae). The black-crested titmouse, found from central and southern Texas southward, was included as a subspecies but now is considered a separate species, &quot;Baeolophus atricristatus&quot;.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Baeolophus&quot; translates to &quot;small crested&quot; and is a compound of the Ancient Greek words : &quot;baiós&quot; meaning &quot;small&quot;, and : &quot;lόphοs&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot;. The specific name &quot;bicolor&quot; means &quot;two-colored&quot;.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

A small bird, the tufted titmouse has a white front and gray upper body outlined with rust-colored flanks. Other characteristics include its black forehead and the tufted grey crest on its head. In juveniles, the black forehead is greatly diminished such that it may be confused with the oak titmouse (although their ranges do not overlap). Males tend to be larger than females.

The song of the tufted titmouse is usually described as a whistled &quot;peter-peter-peter&quot;, although this song can vary in approximately 20 notable ways.

==Distribution and habitat==
The habitat of the tufted titmouse is deciduous and mixed woods as well as gardens, parks, and shrublands. Although it is non-migratory and originally native to the Ohio and Mississippi River basins, factors such as bird feeders have caused it to occupy a larger territory across the United States and stretching into Ontario and Quebec in Canada. During the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the species&#x27; range has been expanding northwards.

==Behavior and ecology==
The tufted titmouse gathers food from the ground and from tree branches, frequently consuming a variety of berries, nuts, seeds, small fruits, insects, and other invertebrates. Caterpillars constitute a major part of its diet during the summer. This species is also a regular visitor to bird feeders. Its normal pattern is to scout a feeder from cover, fly in to take a seed, then fly back to shelter to consume the morsel, though caching is also very common. 

The tufted titmouse can demonstrate curiosity regarding humans and sometimes will perch on a window ledge and seem to be peering into the house. It may also cling to the window frames and walls of buildings seeking prey in wasp and hornet nests. 

The tufted titmouse is very vocal and will respond to sounds of agitation in other birds. This species readily forms small flocks, known as troupes or banditries, which often associate with chickadees and other passerines when foraging.

===Breeding===
Tufted titmice nest in a hole in a tree, either a natural cavity, a human-made nest box, or sometimes an old woodpecker nest. They line the nest with soft materials, sometimes plucking hair from live mammals to use as material, a behavior known as kleptotrichy. If they find snake skin sheds, they may incorporate pieces into their nest. Eggs measure under long and are white or cream-colored with brownish or purplish spots. Eggs have an incubation period of 12–14 days; titmice will then remain nestlings for 15–16 days.

The lifespan of the tufted titmouse is approximately 2.1 years, although it can live for more than ten years. Average clutch size is five to seven eggs. Unlike many birds, the offspring of tufted titmice will often stay with their parents during the winter and even after the first year of their life. Sometimes, a bird born the year before will help its parents raise the next year&#x27;s young.

The tufted titmouse will occasionally hybridize with the black-crested titmouse; the hybridization range is very narrow, however, because of genetic differences.

==Status==
From 1966 to 2015 the tufted titmouse population has increased by more than 1.5% per year throughout the northeastern U.S. The current breeding population is estimated to be approximately 8 million.

<doc id="481053" wikidata="Q1625982" url="?curid=481053" title="Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity">
<text>Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity is a rule based on observation of atomic spectra, which is used to predict the ground state of an atom or molecule with one or more open electronic shells. The rule states that for a given electron configuration, the lowest energy term is the one with the greatest value of spin multiplicity. This implies that if two or more orbitals of equal energy are available, electrons will occupy them singly before filling them in pairs. The rule, discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1925, is of important use in atomic chemistry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemistry, and is often abbreviated to Hund&#x27;s rule, ignoring Hund&#x27;s other two rules.

==Atoms==
The multiplicity of a state is defined as 2S + 1, where S is the total electronic spin. A high multiplicity state is therefore the same as a high-spin state. The lowest-energy state with maximum multiplicity usually has unpaired electrons all with parallel spin. Since the spin of each electron is 1/2, the total spin is one-half the number of unpaired electrons, and the multiplicity is the number of unpaired electrons + 1. For example, the nitrogen atom ground state has three unpaired electrons of parallel spin, so that the total spin is 3/2 and the multiplicity is 4.

The lower energy and increased stability of the atom arise because the high-spin state has unpaired electrons of parallel spin, which must reside in different spatial orbitals according to the Pauli exclusion principle. An early but incorrect explanation of the lower energy of high multiplicity states was that the different occupied spatial orbitals create a larger average distance between electrons, reducing electron-electron repulsion energy. However, quantum-mechanical calculations with accurate wave functions since the 1970s have shown that the actual physical reason for the increased stability is a decrease in the screening of electron-nuclear attractions, so that the unpaired electrons can approach the nucleus more closely and the electron-nuclear attraction is increased.

As a result of Hund&#x27;s rule, constraints are placed on the way atomic orbitals are filled in the ground state using the Aufbau principle. Before any two electrons occupy an orbital in a subshell, other orbitals in the same subshell must first each contain one electron. Also, the electrons filling a subshell will have parallel spin before the shell starts filling up with the opposite spin electrons (after the first orbital gains a second electron). As a result, when filling up atomic orbitals, the maximum number of unpaired electrons (and hence maximum total spin state) is assured.
For example, in the oxygen atom, the 2p4 subshell arranges its electrons as [↑↓] [↑] [↑] rather than [↑↓] [↑] [↓] or [↑↓] [↑↓][ ]. The manganese (Mn) atom has a 3d5 electron configuration with five unpaired electrons all of parallel spin, corresponding to a 6S ground state. The superscript 6 is the value of the multiplicity, corresponding to five unpaired electrons with parallel spin in accordance with Hund&#x27;s rule.

An atom can have a ground state with two incompletely filled subshells which are close in energy. The lightest example is the chromium (Cr) atom with a 3d54s electron configuration. Here there are six unpaired electrons all of parallel spin for a 7S ground state.

==Molecules==
Although most stable molecules have closed electron shells, a few have unpaired electrons for which Hund&#x27;s rule is applicable. The most important example is the dioxygen molecule, O2, which has two degenerate pi antibonding molecular orbitals (π*) occupied by only two electrons. In accordance with Hund&#x27;s rule, the ground state is triplet oxygen with two unpaired electrons in singly occupied orbitals. The singlet oxygen state with one doubly occupied and one empty π* is an excited state with different chemical properties and greater reactivity than the ground state.

==Exception==
* In 2004, researchers reported the synthesis of 5-dehydro-&quot;m&quot;-xylylene (DMX), the first organic molecule known to violate Hund&#x27;s rule.

<doc id="481056" wikidata="Q669056" url="?curid=481056" title="Slater determinant">
<text>In quantum mechanics, a Slater determinant is an expression that describes the wave function of a multi-fermionic system. It satisfies anti-symmetry requirements, and consequently the Pauli principle, by changing sign upon exchange of two fermions. Only a small subset of all possible many-body fermionic wave functions can be written as a single Slater determinant, but those form an important and useful subset because of their simplicity.

The Slater determinant arises from the consideration of a wave function for a collection of electrons, each with a wave function known as the spin-orbital formula_1, where formula_2 denotes the position and spin of a single electron. A Slater determinant containing two electrons with the same spin orbital would correspond to a wave function that is zero everywhere.

The Slater determinant is named for John C. Slater, who introduced the determinant in 1929 as a means of ensuring the antisymmetry of a many-electron wave function, although the wave function in the determinant form first appeared independently in Heisenberg&#x27;s and Dirac&#x27;s articles three years earlier.

== Definition ==

=== Two-particle case ===

The simplest way to approximate the wave function of a many-particle system is to take the product of properly chosen orthogonal wave functions of the individual particles. For the two-particle case with coordinates formula_3 and formula_4, we have

:formula_5

This expression is used in the Hartree method as an ansatz for the many-particle wave function and is known as a Hartree product. However, it is not satisfactory for fermions because the wave function above is not antisymmetric under exchange of any two of the fermions, as it must be according to the Pauli exclusion principle. An antisymmetric wave function can be mathematically described as follows:

:formula_6

This does not hold for the Hartree product, which therefore does not satisfy the Pauli principle. This problem can be overcome by taking a linear combination of both Hartree products:

:formula_7

where the coefficient is the normalization factor. This wave function is now antisymmetric and no longer distinguishes between fermions (that is, one cannot indicate an ordinal number to a specific particle, and the indices given are interchangeable). Moreover, it also goes to zero if any two spin orbitals of two fermions are the same. This is equivalent to satisfying the Pauli exclusion principle.

=== Multi-particle case ===

The expression can be generalised to any number of fermions by writing it as a determinant. For an &quot;N&quot;-electron system, the Slater determinant is defined as

:formula_8

where the last two expressions use a shorthand for Slater determinants: The normalization constant is implied by noting the number N, and only the one-particle wavefunctions (first shorthand) or the indices for the fermion coordinates (second shorthand) are written down. All skipped labels are implied to behave in ascending sequence. The linear combination of Hartree products for the two-particle case is identical with the Slater determinant for &quot;N&quot; = 2. The use of Slater determinants ensures an antisymmetrized function at the outset. In the same way, the use of Slater determinants ensures conformity to the Pauli principle. Indeed, the Slater determinant vanishes if the set formula_9 is linearly dependent. In particular, this is the case when two (or more) spin orbitals are the same. In chemistry one expresses this fact by stating that no two electrons with the same spin can occupy the same spatial orbital.

== Example: Matrix elements in a many electron problem ==

Many properties of the Slater determinant come to life with an example in a non-relativistic many electron problem.
* &quot;The one particle terms of the Hamiltonian will contribute in the same manner as for the simple Hartree product, namely the energy is summed and the states are independent&quot;
* &quot;The multi-particle terms of the Hamiltonian will introduce exchange term to lower of the energy for the anti-symmetrized wave function&quot;

Starting from a molecular Hamiltonian:
formula_10
where formula_11 are the electrons and formula_12are the nuclei and
: formula_13

For simplicity we freeze the nuclei at equilibrium in one position and we remain with a simplified Hamiltonian
: formula_14
where
: formula_15

and where we will distinguish in the Hamiltonian between the first set of terms as formula_16 (the &quot;1&quot; particle terms) 
and the last term formula_17 (the &quot;2&quot; particle term) which contains exchange term for a Slater determinant.

: formula_18
: formula_19

The two parts will behave differently when they have to interact with a Slater determinant wave function. We start to compute the expectation values of one-particle terms
: formula_20
In the above expression, we can just select the identical permutation in the determinant in the left part, since all the other N! − 1 permutations would give the same result as the selected one. We can thus cancel N! at the denominator
: formula_21
Because of the orthonormality of spin-orbitals it is also evident that only the identical permutation survives in the determinant on the right part of the above matrix element
: formula_22
This result shows that the anti-symmetrization of the product does not have any effect for the one particle terms and it behaves as it would do in the case of the simple Hartree product.

And finally we remain with the trace over the one-particle Hamiltonians
: formula_23
Which tells us that to the extent of the one-particle terms the wave functions of the electrons are independent of each other and the expectation value of total system is given by the sum of expectation value of the single particles.

For the two-particle terms instead
: formula_24

If we focus on the action of one term of formula_25, it will produce only the two terms
: formula_26

And finally
formula_27

which instead is a mixing term. The first contribution is called the &quot;coulomb&quot; term or &quot;coulomb&quot; integral and the second is the &quot;exchange&quot; term or exchange integral. Sometimes different range of index in the summation is used formula_28 since the Coulomb and exchange contributions exactly cancel each other for formula_29.

It is important to notice explicitly that the exchange term, which is always positive for local spin-orbitals, is absent in simple Hartree product. Hence the electron-electron repulsive energy formula_30 on the antisymmetrized product of spin-orbitals is always lower than the electron-electron repulsive energy on the simple Hartree product of the same spin-orbitals. Since exchange bielectronic integrals are different from zero only for spin-orbitals with parallel spins, we link the decrease in energy with the physical fact that electrons with parallel spin are kept apart in real space in Slater determinant states.

== As an approximation ==

Most fermionic wavefunctions cannot be represented as a Slater determinant. The best Slater approximation to a given fermionic wave function can be defined to be the one that maximizes the overlap between the Slater determinant and the target wave function. The maximal overlap is a geometric measure of entanglement between the fermions.

A single Slater determinant is used as an approximation to the electronic wavefunction in Hartree–Fock theory. In more accurate theories (such as configuration interaction and MCSCF), a linear combination of Slater determinants is needed.

== Discussion ==

The word &quot;detor&quot; was proposed by S. F. Boys to refer to a Slater determinant of orthonormal orbitals, but this term is rarely used.

Unlike fermions that are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, two or more bosons can occupy the same single-particle quantum state. Wavefunctions describing systems of identical bosons are symmetric under the exchange of particles and can be expanded in terms of permanents.

<text>The 1896 Canadian federal election was held on June 23, 1896, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 8th Parliament of Canada. Though the Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Charles Tupper, won a plurality of the popular vote, the Liberal Party, led by Wilfrid Laurier, won the majority of seats (with only 41 percent of the vote) to form the next government. The election ended 18 years of Conservative rule.

This was first election in Canada to produce a House of Commons with elected members of four parties. The Liberals and Conservative shared the chamber with elected members of the farmer-based Patrons of Industry and McCarthyites.

==Description==
The governing Conservative Party, since the death of John A. Macdonald in 1891, was disorganized. Following Macdonald&#x27;s death, John Abbott spent a year as Prime Minister before handing over to John Thompson. Thompson proved a relatively popular Prime Minister, but his sudden death in December 1894 resulted in his replacement by Mackenzie Bowell, whose tenure as Prime Minister proved a disaster. The Conservatives soon became viewed as corrupt and wasteful of public funds, partially due to the McGreevy-Langevin Scandal. Issues like the Manitoba Schools Question had cost the party support in both French and English Canada.

Though Bowell nominally remained Prime Minister until the election was called, leadership of the Conservative Party had been functionally taken over by Sir Charles Tupper, a Father of Confederation and former Premier of Nova Scotia. Earlier, in February 1896, Tupper introduced remedial legislation to settle the Manitoba dispute, but it was filibustered by the McCarthyites, an alliance of extreme Protestants led by Dalton McCarthy, and the Liberals. This filibuster resulted in Tupper abandoning the bill and asking for a dissolution. Parliament was dissolved on April 24, 1896, and, in accordance with an agreement between Bowell and Tupper that the latter would become Prime Minister following the election call, he became prime minister on May 1, 1896, thus forming the 7th Canadian Ministry.

Tupper argued that the real issue of the election was the future of Canadian industry, and he insisted that Conservatives needed to unite to defeat the Patrons of Industry. However, the Conservatives were so bitterly divided over the Manitoba Schools Question that wherever he spoke, he was faced with a barrage of criticism, most notably at a two-hour address he gave at Massey Hall in Toronto, which was constantly interrupted by the crowd.

The election saw a great change in the Liberal Party. While the Liberals had traditionally been the party for radical change and free trade, in the 1896 election, they embraced a much more conservative platform. That helped many of the traditional supporters of the Conservative Party move to the Liberals. The most important change was Laurier&#x27;s support of the National Policy, an important cause to the powerful business interests of Montreal and Toronto. The Liberal campaign was directed by an ex-Conservative, Joseph Israël Tarte. Laurier was also a strong supporter of provincial rights, and a number of powerful Liberal premiers supported the campaign, such as Ontario&#x27;s Oliver Mowat and Nova Scotia&#x27;s W. S. Fielding, both of whom who won seats in the House and were appointed to cabinet after the election.

The Conservatives won more votes in the 1896 election than the Liberals (48.2% of the votes in comparison to 41.4% for the Liberals). However, the Liberals took more seats. The Conservatives captured about half of the seats in English Canada. They suffered losses in Quebec, where Tupper&#x27;s reputation as an ardent imperialist was a major handicap. Tupper&#x27;s inability to persuade Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau to return to active politics as his Quebec lieutenant ended any chances of the Conservatives winning the most seats that province. Meanwhile, Laurier&#x27;s Liberals won a landslide victory in Quebec, as well as getting some seats in English Canada (especially in the Maritimes and the West).

Tupper initially refused to resign as Prime Minister, insisting that Laurier would be unable to form a government. However, when Tupper attempted to make appointments as prime minister, Governor General Lord Aberdeen refused. Tupper resigned, and the governor general invited Laurier to form a government.

<text>Briercrest (2016 population: ) is a village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan within the Rural Municipality of Redburn No. 130 and Census Division No. 6. The village is approximately 42 km southeast of the City of Moose Jaw and 77 km southwest of the City of Regina. When the post office formed in 1903, it was a part of the Federal Electoral District: Assiniboia, North West Territories, as well as part of the provisional district of Assiniboia West, North West Territories, until the province of Saskatchewan was formed in 1905.

== History ==
Briercrest incorporated as a village on April 17, 1912.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Briercrest had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population, the Village of Briercrest recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Education ==

Coventry School Division (SD) 213, North West Territories (NWT) was one of the first one-room schools started in 1891. Hipperholme SD 467, NWT soon followed in 1899. Many more one-room school districts developed in the early 1900s to survive until the mid-20th century when they were gradually replaced with the Briercrest Family of Schools.

;Briercrest College and Seminary
The Briercrest College and Seminary was originally founded as the Briercrest Bible Institute in Briercrest in 1935, which has since moved to Caronport. In 1946, a larger facility was needed for the increasing number of students, and the airbase at Caronport became the school&#x27;s new home. The school, however, continued to honour its early history by retaining the name of Briercrest as its birthplace.

<text>Serabit el-Khadim ( ; also transliterated Serabit al-Khadim, Serabit el-Khadem) is a locality in the southwest Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, where turquoise was mined extensively in antiquity, mainly by the ancient Egyptians. Archaeological excavation, initially by Sir Flinders Petrie, revealed ancient mining camps and a long-lived Temple of Hathor, the Egyptian goddess who was favoured as a protector in desert regions and known locally as the mistress of the turquoise. The temple was first established during the Middle Kingdom in the reign of Sesostris I (reigned 1971 BC to 1926 BC) and was partly reconstructed in the New Kingdom.

==Inscriptions==
Thirty incised graffiti in a &quot;Proto-Sinaitic script&quot; shed light on the history of the alphabet. The mines were worked by prisoners of war from southwest Asia who presumably spoke a Northwest Semitic language, such as the Canaanite that was ancestral to Phoenician and Hebrew. The incisions date from the beginning of the 16th century BC.

Like the match itself (England–Scotland), the Calcutta Cup is the oldest trophy contested between any two international rugby union teams, pre-dating the Bledisloe Cup (Australia–New Zealand) by more than half a century. It is also the oldest of several trophies awarded under the umbrella of the Six Nations Championship, which include the Millennium Trophy (England–Ireland), Centenary Quaich (Ireland–Scotland), Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy (France–Italy), Auld Alliance Trophy (France–Scotland), the Doddie Weir Cup (Scotland–Wales) and the Cuttitta Cup (Italy–Scotland).

==History==
===Calcutta Club===
On Christmas Day in 1872 a game of rugby union football was played in Calcutta, British India by a group of forty people (twenty-a-side), with one team representing England and the other Scotland. Following this match, and the growth of British Sport in India, the Calcutta Rugby Football Club was formally established in January the following year by expats, former students of Rugby School, and soldiers of the Royal East Kent Regiment. In 1874, the club joined the Rugby Football Union (RFU). By 1878, the club&#x27;s diminishing members withdrew club funds, a total of ₹270, and had them melted down to make a trophy. The trophy was presented by the club to the RFU and was used as “the best means of doing some lasting good for the cause of Rugby Football.”

===The cup===
The domed lid is surmounted by an elephant which is, it is said, copied from the Viceroy&#x27;s own stock. The inscription on the Cup&#x27;s wooden base reads: The Calcutta Cup.

There is an anomaly in the recording of the winning country on the base of the Cup. It was first played for in 1879, but the plinth shows records extending back to the first international in 1871.

While the original was handmade by Indian craftsmen, the replicas were made using modern technology.

In 1988 the cup was damaged by the antics of some drunken players, including England number eight Dean Richards and Scotland flanker John Jeffrey who played football with the Calcutta Cup along Princes Street in Edinburgh. Jeffrey received a six-month ban from the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), whilst Richards was given a one-match sentence from England.

==Competition==
Despite the initial request of the Calcutta Club that the trophy be used as rugby&#x27;s answer to football&#x27;s FA Cup, the RFU refused to turn the Calcutta Cup into a knock-out competition for English club sides. They believed that &quot;competitiveness&quot; ran against the amateur ethos and instead decided that a game should be played each year between England and Scotland and whoever wins should keep it for that year. The first Calcutta Cup match was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on 10 March 1879 and ended in a draw; Scotland scored a drop goal and England a goal. The following year on 28 February 1880 England became the first winners of the Calcutta Cup when they defeated Scotland by two goals &amp; three tries to one goal in Manchester. Matches have continued on an annual basis except for two interruptions due to the World Wars between 1915–1919 and 1940–1946.

As of 2025, 132 Calcutta Cup matches have taken place. Currently, this game is the annual match between the two nations in the Six Nations Championship. The ground alternates between Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh (on even years) and Twickenham Stadium in London (on odd years).

In 2004, the two countries&#x27; rugby governing bodies, the Rugby Football Union (England) and the Scottish Rugby Union, were considering a plan to add a second Calcutta Cup fixture each year, outside the Six Nations Championship. The second fixture would be hosted by the away nation in the Six Nations fixture of the same year. Under that plan, one nation would have to win both matches to take the Cup off its current holder. Due to a largely unfavourable reaction, the proposal was dropped.

==Results==
===Results summary===
 

==Records==
The current record number of points scored by a player in a Calcutta Cup game was set by Jonny Wilkinson in 2007 when he scored 27 points (1 try, 2 conversions, 5 penalties, 1 drop goal). The previous record of 24 points was held by Rob Andrew.

==Other Calcutta Cups==

In 1884, Calcutta Cricket and Football Club again set up a rugby section and in 1890 set up an inter club trophy, the Calcutta Rugby Union Challenge Cup, promptly christened the Calcutta Cup.

The 2007 edition of the Cup was held by Jungle Crows, in which Future Hope Harlequins defeated CC&amp;FC in final. The second division trophy was won by Calcutta Cricket and Football Club Panthers.

The original and oldest Calcutta Cup is a silver trophy played for annually by the members of Royal Blackheath Golf Club. It was a gift from the Royal Calcutta Golf Club in response to the presentation of a medal given by Blackheath. It is made from melted down silver rupees, reputedly from the same batch of melted down silver rupees as the Rugby Union Cup played for between England and Scotland. The cup arrived in London in 1875. It was first played for in December 1875 three years before the first Calcutta Cup match between England and Scotland. The Cup held by Royal Blackheath Golf Club has only two handles unlike the well known Calcutta Cup. It is only in recent years that the history of the original Calcutta Cup has been appreciated by sporting historians.

Royal Blackheath Golf Club members had close links with Blackheath Football Club (Rugby) which was one of the most prominent clubs in the early years of the Rugby Football Union. Members of both clubs served in India in the 1870s. This link is the most likely explanation for the creation of a similar cup being created by the Calcutta Rugby Club a few years later and becoming the world-famous Calcutta Cup.

<doc id="481077" wikidata="Q470792" url="?curid=481077" title="Harry Hammond Hess">
<text>Harry Hammond Hess (May 24, 1906 – August 25, 1969) was an American geologist and a United States Navy officer in World War II who is considered one of the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the unifying theory of plate tectonics. He published theories on sea floor spreading, specifically on relationships between island arcs, seafloor gravity anomalies, and serpentinized peridotite, suggesting that the convection in the Earth&#x27;s mantle is the driving force behind this process.

== Early life and education ==
Harry Hammond Hess was born on May 24, 1906, in New York City to Julian S. Hess, a member of the New York Stock Exchange, and Elizabeth Engel Hess. He attended Asbury Park High School in Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 1923, he entered Yale University, where he intended to study electrical engineering but ended up graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in geology. Hess failed his first time taking mineralogy at Yale and was told he had no future in the field. Despite this, he continued with his degree and was teaching geology at Princeton when World War II was declared. He spent two years as an exploration geologist in Northern Rhodesia. In 1934 he married Annette Burns.

==Teaching career==
Harry Hess taught for one year (1932–1933) at Rutgers University in New Jersey and spent a year as a research associate at the Geophysical Laboratory of Washington, D. C., before joining the faculty of Princeton University in 1934. Hess remained at Princeton for the rest of his career and served as Geology Department Chairman from 1950 to 1966. He was a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa (1949–1950), and the University of Cambridge, England (1965).

==The Navy-Princeton gravity expedition to the West Indies in 1932==
Hess accompanied Dr. Felix Vening Meinesz of Utrecht University on board the US Navy submarine USS S-48 to assist with the second U.S. expedition to obtain gravity measurements at sea. The expedition used a gravimeter, or gravity meter, designed by Meinesz. The submarine traveled a route from Guantanamo, Cuba, to Key West, Florida, and return to Guantanamo through the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos region from 5 February through 25 March 1932. The description of operations and results of the expedition were published by the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office in &quot;The Navy-Princeton gravity expedition to the West Indies in 1932&quot;.

==Military and war career==
Hess joined the United States Navy during World War II, becoming captain of the USS &quot;Cape Johnson&quot;, an attack transport ship equipped with a new technology: sonar. This command would later prove to be key in Hess&#x27;s development of his theory of sea floor spreading. Hess carefully tracked his travel routes to Pacific Ocean landings on the Marianas, Philippines, and Iwo Jima, continuously using his ship&#x27;s echo sounder. This unplanned wartime scientific surveying enabled Hess to collect ocean floor profiles across the North Pacific Ocean, resulting in the discovery of flat-topped submarine volcanoes, which he termed guyots, after the 19th-century geographer Arnold Henry Guyot. After the war, he remained in the Naval Reserve, rising to the rank of rear admiral.

==Scientific discoveries==
In 1960, Hess made his single most important contribution, which is regarded as part of the major advance in geologic science of the 20th century. In a widely circulated report to the Office of Naval Research, he advanced the theory, now generally accepted, that the Earth&#x27;s crust moved laterally away from long, volcanically active oceanic ridges. He only understood his ocean floor profiles across the North Pacific Ocean after Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen (1953, Lamont Group) discovered the Great Global Rift, running along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. &quot;Seafloor spreading&quot;, as the process was later named, helped establish Alfred Wegener&#x27;s earlier (but generally dismissed at the time) concept of continental drift as scientifically respectable. This triggered a revolution in the earth sciences. Hess&#x27;s report was formally published in his &quot;History of Ocean Basins&quot; (1962), which for a time was the single most referenced work in solid-earth geophysics. Hess was also involved in many other scientific endeavours, including the Mohole project (1957–1966), an investigation onto the feasibility and techniques of deep sea drilling.

==Accolades and affiliations==
Hess was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1952 and the American Philosophical Society in 1960. He was president of The Geological Society of America in 1963 and received their Penrose Medal in 1966. In 1968, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Death==
Hess died from a heart attack in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on August 25, 1969, while chairing a meeting of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery and was posthumously awarded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s Distinguished Public Service Award.

==The Harry H. Hess Medal==

The American Geophysical Union established the Harry H. Hess medal in his memory in 1984 to &quot;honor outstanding achievements in research of the constitution and evolution of Earth and sister planets.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Harlem Heights was fought during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War. The action took place on September 16, 1776, in what is now the Morningside Heights area and east into the future Harlem neighborhoods of northwestern Manhattan Island in what is now part of New York City.

The Continental Army, under Commander-in-chief General George Washington, Major General Nathanael Greene, and Major General Israel Putnam, totaling around 9,000 men, held a series of high ground positions in upper Manhattan. Immediately opposite was the vanguard of the British Army totaling around 5,000 men under the command of Major General Henry Clinton.

An early morning skirmish between a patrol of Knowlton&#x27;s Rangers and British light infantry pickets developed into a running fight as the British pursued the Americans back through woods towards Washington&#x27;s position on Harlem Heights. The overconfident British light troops, having advanced too far from their lines without support, had exposed themselves to counter-attack. Seeing this, Washington ordered a flanking maneuver which failed to cut off the British force but, in the face of this attack and pressure from troops arriving from the Harlem Heights position, the outnumbered British retreated.

Meeting reinforcements coming from the south and with the added support of a pair of field pieces, the British light infantry turned and made a stand in open fields on Morningside Heights. The Americans, also reinforced, came on in strength and there followed a lengthy exchange of fire. After two hours, with ammunition running short, the British force began to pull back to their lines. Washington cut short the pursuit, unwilling to risk a general engagement with the British main force, and withdrew to his own lines. The battle helped restore the confidence of the Continental Army after suffering several defeats. It was Washington&#x27;s first battlefield success of the war.

After a month without any major fighting between the armies, Washington was forced to withdraw his army north to the town of White Plains in southeastern New York when the British moved west into Westchester County and threatened to flank Washington further south on Manhattan. After two defeats Washington retreated west across the Hudson River.

==Background==
 On August 27, 1776, British troops under the command of General William Howe flanked and defeated the American army at the Battle of Long Island. Howe moved his forces and pinned the Americans down at Brooklyn Heights, with the East River to the American rear. On the night of August 29, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, evacuated his entire army of 9,000 men and their equipment across the water to Manhattan.

On September 15, Howe landed his army in an amphibious operation at Kip&#x27;s Bay, on the eastern shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops began to disembark. The American troops began to flee at the sight of the enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers stand and fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.

After scattering the Americans at Kip&#x27;s Bay, Howe landed 9,000 more troops, but did not immediately cut off the American retreat from New York Town in the south of the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the west side of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.

==Battle==
Early on September 16, Washington received reports, which proved to be unfounded, that the British were advancing. Washington, who had been expecting an attack, had ordered a party of 150 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to reconnoiter the British lines. At daybreak, Knowlton&#x27;s troops were spotted by British pickets from Brigadier Alexander Leslie&#x27;s Light Infantry brigade.

Two or three companies of the 2nd Light Infantry Battalion advanced to attack the enemy to their front. For more than half an hour the skirmish continued, in the woods spanning two farm properties, Jones&#x27; and Hoaglandt&#x27;s. When Knowlton realized that the numerically superior British forces were about to turn his flank, he ordered a retreat, which was conducted &quot;without confusion or loss&quot;, although perhaps ten men had been lost in the initial skirmish.

The British followed in rapid pursuit. Knowlton&#x27;s party emerged into the open on the edge of the woods overlooking a wide re-entrant known as the &quot;Hollow Way&quot;, which marked the forward edge of Washington&#x27;s position. The rangers crossed into the American lines while the pursuing light infantry, on reaching the tree line, paused to reorganize. The sound of their bugle calls, whether calling the skirmishers to regroup or calling for reinforcements, to Washington&#x27;s Adjutant General Colonel Joseph Reed were reminiscent of a fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult.

Probably about this time, elements of the 2nd and 3rd Light Infantry Battalions, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had gone forward to confer with Knowlton, rode back to brief Washington and encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Washington, seeing an opportunity to revive the spirits of his men, devised a plan to entrap the unwary enemy patrol. He ordered troops forward to make a diversionary attack, in order to draw the British down into the Hollow Way, while another detachment moved around the British right flank to cut them off.

The diversionary party, composed of 150 volunteers, ran into the Hollow Way and began to engage the British, who responded by advancing down into the valley to occupy a wooded fenceline and returned fire. The volunteers were then reinforced by a further 900 men and a prolonged exchange of fire ensued, although the two sides were too far apart to do much damage.

The flanking party consisted of Knowlton&#x27;s Rangers, reinforced by three companies of Virginia riflemen commanded by Major Andrew Leitch, in total about 200 men. As they moved forward, it seems an unidentified officer accidentally misdirected the group, and the manoeuvre caught the British in the flank, not their rear. During the attack, both Knowlton and Leitch were shot and fatally injured. Despite this, the American troops pushed on.

The British troops, realizing that their flank was in danger, retreated uphill to occupy a fence-line. Washington reinforced his troops in the Hollow Way and together with the flanking party mounted a frontal attack. The British light infantry retired across open farmland to a buckwheat field in the area where Barnard College now stands. Here they received reinforcements; including a pair of 3-pdr guns.

Washington was originally reluctant to pursue the British troops, but after seeing that his men were slowly pushing the British back, he sent in reinforcements and permitted the troops to engage in a direct attack. By the time that all of the reinforcements arrived, nearly 1,800 Americans were engaged in the buckwheat field. To direct the battle, members of Washington&#x27;s staff, including Nathanael Greene, were sent in. By this time, the British troops had also been reinforced; bringing their strength up to a number slightly less than the attacking Americans.

For an hour and a half, the battle continued in the field and in the surrounding woods until, with some units, including the 3-pdrs, having fired away their ammunition, the British began to withdraw. The Americans pressed forward in pursuit until Washington, concerned about the approach of British reserves, ordered a halt. Upon receiving Washington&#x27;s orders to return to their lines, the troops gave a loud &quot;huzzah&quot; and left the field in good order.

==Aftermath==
The British casualties were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but a member of Howe&#x27;s staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. The author David McCullough suggests much higher figures of &quot;probably...90 killed and about 300 wounded&quot; but cites no source for this. Henry Johnston, whose 1897 study remains the only detailed investigation of the battle, assessed British losses at 14 killed and 157 wounded and those of the Americans at about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Colonel Knowlton among the dead.

Major Andrew Leitch, commander of the Virginia riflemen, died some days later. Both sides claimed victory. The repulse of British troops in this &quot;pretty sharp skirmish&quot; boosted morale in the American ranks &quot;prodigiously&quot;, as George Washington observed, even among those who had not been engaged. It also marked the first success of the war for the army directly under Washington&#x27;s command.

There was little fighting for the next month of the campaign, but Washington moved his army to White Plains in October after hearing that the British were attempting to trap him on Manhattan. After being defeated at the Battle of White Plains and later at Fort Washington, Washington and his army retreated across New Jersey, pursued by the British, into Pennsylvania.

The loss of Knowlton was a blow to the fledgling American intelligence operations, as he had created and led the first such unit of the Continental Army, at the direction of Washington.

<text>Eggs Benedict is a common American breakfast or brunch dish, consisting of two halves of an English muffin, each topped with Canadian bacon or sliced ham, a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. The dish is believed to have originated in New York City.

== Origin and history ==

There are conflicting accounts as to the origin of eggs Benedict.

Delmonico&#x27;s in Lower Manhattan says on its menu that &quot;Eggs Benedict was first created in our ovens in 1860.&quot; One of its former chefs, Charles Ranhofer, also published the recipe for &quot;Eggs à la Benedick&quot; in 1894.

In an interview recorded in the &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; column of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1942, the year before his death, Lemuel Benedict, a retired Wall Street stock broker, said that he had wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in 1894 and, hoping to find a cure for his morning hangover, ordered &quot;buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon, and a hooker of hollandaise&quot;. Oscar Tschirky, the &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, was so impressed with the dish that he put it on the breakfast and luncheon menus but substituted ham for the bacon and a toasted English muffin for the toast.

A later claim to the creation of eggs Benedict was circuitously made by Edward P. Montgomery on behalf of Commodore E. C. Benedict. In 1967 Montgomery wrote a letter to then &quot;The New York Times&quot; food columnist Craig Claiborne, which included a recipe he said he had received through his uncle, a friend of the commodore. Commodore Benedict&#x27;s recipe—by way of Montgomery—varies greatly from Ranhofer&#x27;s version, particularly in the hollandaise sauce preparation—calling for the addition of a &quot;hot, hard-cooked egg and ham mixture&quot;.

The modern version differs a bit from these early versions and has split English muffin, topped Canadian bacon, lightly poached egg, and smothered in hollandaise sauce, which is made from eggs, lemon, and melted butter.

==Variations==

It is popular to make variations on eggs Benedict, and some of the most popular are eggs florentine (spinach replaces bacon), eggs royale (smoked salmon replaces bacon), eggs Sardou (spinach and artichoke replaces bacon and muffin), eggs neptune (crab replaces bacon), eggs cochon (pulled pork replaces bacon and buttermilk biscuit replaces the muffin). In many cases its become popular to simply replace the word eggs with the meat that at replaces bacon, for example, rather than &quot;eggs neptune&quot;, &quot;crab benedict&quot;, even though the recipe still has two poached eggs. Examples of this are steak benedict or salmon benedict, and replacements include corned beef, fried chicken, or shrimp.

Many variations of eggs Benedict exist, the most common involve replacing the bacon or English muffin, or both:
* Avocado toast eggs Benedict – substitutes toast in place of the muffin and adds sliced avocado.
* California eggs Benedict – adds sliced Hass avocado. Variations may include sliced tomato instead of Canadian bacon.
* Eggs Balmoral – substitutes haggis in place of Canadian bacon.
* Eggs Blackstone – substitutes streaky bacon in place of Canadian bacon and adds a tomato slice.
* Eggs Blanchard – substitutes béchamel sauce in place of Hollandaise.
* Eggs Chesapeake (crab eggs Benedict, crab cakes Benedict) – substitutes a Maryland blue crab cake in place of Canadian bacon.
* Eggs Cochon (eggs cochon de lait) – substitutes pork &quot;debris&quot; (slow roasted pork shredded in its own juices) in place of Canadian bacon, buttermilk biscuit in place of the English muffin. Served in New Orleans restaurants.
* Eggs Florentine – adds spinach, sometimes substituted in place of the Canadian bacon. Older versions of eggs Florentine add spinach to poached or shirred eggs. The cheese gruyère mornay is added, though sometimes hollandaise is subbed.
* Eggs Hebridean – a Scottish variety, substitutes black pudding in place of the Canadian bacon.
* Eggs Hussarde – substitutes Holland rusks in place of the English muffin and adds Bordelaise sauce.
* Eggs Mornay – substitutes Mornay sauce in place of the Hollandaise.
*Eggs Neptune – substitutes crab meat in place of Canadian bacon.
* Steak Benedict – substitutes a small steak in place of Canadian bacon and sometimes replaces the Hollandaise with béarnaise.
* Eggs Royale – substitutes salmon which may be smoked, in place of Canadian bacon.
*Eggs Trivette – adds Creole mustard to the Hollandaise and a topping of crayfish.
* Eggs Sardou - 19th century New Orleans variation, has poached eggs with artichoke hearts, creamed spinach, and hollandaise sauce.
* Eggs Woodhouse – includes two eggs and artichoke hearts, creamed spinach, bechamel sauce, Iberico ham, black truffle and beluga caviar. The recipe is featured in the book &quot;How To Archer&quot;, inspired by the television series &quot;Archer&quot; on FXX.
* Eggs Zenedict – adds toasted scone and peameal bacon smothered in sundried tomato Hollandaise. A specialty of restaurants in the defunct Canadian retail chain Zellers.
* Huevos Benedictos – adds sliced avocado or Mexican chorizo, topped with salsa (such as or ) and Hollandaise sauce.
* Irish Benedict – substitutes corned beef or Irish bacon in place of Canadian bacon.
* New Jersey Benedict – substitutes Taylor pork roll in place of Canadian bacon.

Some variations involve replacing the Canadian bacon, such as lobster benedict, corned beef, or steak benedict. In other cases the bread might be changed from an English muffin, to toast, sliced potato, or a biscuit. One popular variation is to replace the Canadian bacon with smoke salmon, and it has gather a large number of names from Eggs Royale, Atlantic, Montreal, and others, and some regions have a local name for this variation.

Meatless Eggs Benedict may omit the Canadian bacon altogether, or replace it with something else such as avocado, tomato, mushroom, or tofu. There is a version of California Eggs Benedict that replaces the Canadian bacon with sliced tomato and avocado.

Eggs benedict has also been made into breakfast sandwich by adding an additional English muffin half on top.

A version which replaces the sauce, is &quot;Eggs Halifax&quot;, which substitutes New England clam chowder for hollandaise.

<doc id="481092" wikidata="Q7113474" url="?curid=481092" title="Over the Edge (radio program)">
<text>Over the Edge (or OTE) is a sound collage radio program hosted and produced in the United States by Jon Leidecker (&quot;Wobbly&quot;) and Robert Cole (&quot;KrOB&quot;), who took over in 2015 after the death of longtime host Don Joyce. 

Leidecker, like Joyce, is a member of the pioneering sound collage band Negativland, other members of which have frequently appeared on the show. A series of &quot;Over the Edge&quot; episodes have been released under the Negativland name, first on cassette and later CD. Critic Ned Raggett describes &quot;Over the Edge&quot; as &quot;a merry trip into an alternate world,&quot; while critic Stephen Cramer describes &quot;Over the Edge&quot; as &quot;the longest-running block of free-form radio in the history of radio ... essentially live performance art.&quot;

Founded in 1981, &quot;OTE&quot; is broadcast live on KPFA in Berkeley, California, every second, third, and fourth Thursday night/Friday morning from midnight to 3 a.m. On the rare occasion of a month with a fifth Thursday OTE runs an additional two hours, from midnight to 5 a.m. The show is also available online, streamed live from KPFA.org (which podcasts the show), or from Negativland.com, where many older episodes are available as well. approximately 1300 episodes are stored at the Internet Archive. It is the group&#x27;s plan to digitize and archive every episode ever made.

==History==
Negativland members—often just Joyce—have broadcast &quot;OTE&quot; since June 1981. &quot;OTE&quot; began as a rather conventional music show, though Joyce gradually experimented with the format, due to his disapproval of what he saw as radio&#x27;s primary function (encouraging listeners to buy music recordings). The show was originally on Sundays at midnight, following &quot;Music from the Hearts of Space&quot;. It changed time slots a few times, but now broadcasts in the Thursday/Friday midnight to 3 a.m. slot. Due to various obligations on the part of the host(s) or the KPFA DJs on before and after him, the show is sometimes not aired at all, or is sometimes much longer (up to five hours), or is hosted by friends of Negativland such as the hosts of the &quot;Puzzling Evidence&quot; show which usually airs after &quot;OTE&quot;. Usually these kinds of scheduling changes are announced the week previous, or in the closing minutes of the previous show.

==Format==
Joyce declared that with &quot;OTE&quot;, he and his collaborators &quot;create &#x27;direct-reference&#x27; collages, manipulating and mixing both found and original sounds to produce a new kind of audio animal. &quot;OTE&quot; is always concerned with recycling existing cultural elements to some new, unintended effect.&quot;

Joyce used sound collage techniques, weaving many sources together throughout the program to create a &quot;conversational&quot; form of audio presentation. Sources might include recordings of other radio programs (including old time radio shows, commercials, talk shows, or news programs), portions of documentary films, songs and more, all typically—but not always—related to a pre-selected theme.

Joyce usually played a &quot;bed&quot; of unobtrusive background music, and adds reverberation or other special effects to sound sources. He also employed the &quot;Booper&quot;, a circuit-bending oscillator created by David Wills (&quot;The Weatherman&quot;), to create electronic and synthesized tones that he incorporates into the show. 

&quot;OTE&quot;″s theme music is the track &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock (in two parts)&quot; from &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975), by Vangelis. Most of the time, this song begins each show, though in some cases other sounds may play over it, and the song may be slowed down or sped up, depending on the show&#x27;s theme. About two-thirds of the way through the song during a natural pause in the music, the song stops and Joyce played a teaser, which indicates a topic or theme he would explore for the episode.

Following the theme music, Joyce would usually announce the theme of the show, and when appropriate, say a few words that relate to previous or upcoming events. Usually at the top of the hour Joyce performed a station identification for KPFA, and near the end of the show made a similar closing announcement. At the very end of each episode Joyce played a recording of a woman&#x27;s voice reading a statement attributed to photographer Man Ray: &quot;To create is divine. To reproduce is human. Man Ray.&quot;

Throughout most shows, regardless of content, Joyce played spots that identified the show as part of the Universal Media Netweb. This is part of an ongoing Joyce-concocted plot and overarching narrative connecting the majority of &quot;Over the Edge&quot; broadcasts, featuring a cast of recurring characters and situations. 

Occasionally, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; will subvert or toy with established &quot;OTE&quot; formats when it suits the theme of the show. Joyce or his guests played various UMN characters, and would sometimes even skip the theme music and other show conventions, to better create the feel and sound of another kind of show. The best-known example might be &quot;The California Superstation&quot;, released as &quot;Over the Edge Vol. 4: Dick Vaughn&#x27;s Moribund Music of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Negativland member Richard Lyons played his recurring character, the Dick Clark-like &#x27;70s corporate radio mogul Dick Vaughn. The premise of the episode was that KPFA&#x27;s format had officially changed to a &#x27;70s oldies theme. It was so smoothly done that a few fans of the show actually believed it and became quite confused, which is ironic given that the collage nature of the show tends to confuse the average radio listener.

==Receptacle programming==
The audience phone participation (&quot;Receptacle Programming&quot;) is another element of the format: listeners are encouraged to call in, and are placed on-air, sometimes two or three at a time, with no prior screening. Listeners can then play their own recordings for &quot;OTE&quot;, offer commentary or non-sequiturs, or, less often, converse with Joyce. People are allowed to remain on the air as long as Joyce judges their contributions valuable, from a few seconds to several minutes or more. The highly improvisational content and late hour of the broadcast attract a variety of colorful callers. 

According to Joyce, Receptacle Programming is, ideally, a collaboration: 

There are only two rules for callers: (1) When the phone stops ringing, you&#x27;re on the air; (2) Don&#x27;t say &quot;Hello.&quot;

Many fans and regular callers of the show have home-brewed their own electronic devices to aid in sending sound over the phone.

Leidecker has continued to present the show using Joyce&#x27;s original format, including receptacle programming. He asks that callers try to use Skype and avoid calling in on their cellphones, for better sound quality.

==Topics==
Joyce typically followed one theme for an entire program. Topics vary wildly, from motion pictures, to various music and copyright issues and the CIA; one episode each was devoted to Ken Nordine and to radio comedy team Bob and Ray. 

Usually only a few times a year, Joyce did an episode in a series called &quot;Another UFO&quot;. Each episode examines one facet of the unidentified flying object phenomenon, such as alien abduction, cattle mutilation, or the Roswell UFO incident. These episodes are a fan favorite, and a subject that Joyce himself is continually fascinated with.

In 2006 Joyce began two on-going series: &quot;How Radio Isn&#x27;t Done&quot; (about pirate radio and other broadcasting renegades and/or bloopers), and &quot;How Radio Was Done&quot; (about the history of radio as a cultural phenomenon, with recorded samplings from hundreds of thousands of airchecks).

==Characters and story==
&quot;Over the Edge&quot; often uses personas and characters, created by Joyce and his cohorts, to give the show a textual depth and continuity over time. The show purports to be part of the &quot;Universal Media Netweb,&quot; a broadcasting entity that offers any number of shows, and specializes in Receptacle Programming. The UMN employs a number of people, including Joyce, and is responsible for the UMN spots that Joyce plays throughout his shows. While new developments in this storyline ebbed and flowed as Joyce&#x27;s interests shifted and change over time, there are recurring characters that crop up fairly often.

===C. Elliot Friday===
UMN is supposedly funded by a wealthy recluse, C. Elliot Friday, who lives in a secret retreat on Howland Island, and emerges every four years to run for President on the Universal Party ticket. He is an inventor who has devised various gadgets marketed as &quot;Fridatronics&quot;, including the Cubulax and the new DIECORP technology designed to make all music available to everyone absolutely free. He also came up with nutritional supplements like the &quot;Mertz&quot; pill (&quot;Mertz makes up your mind!&quot;)

===Crosley Bendix===
Crosley Bendix was a radio personality (played by Joyce) for a series of commentaries. Bendix was touted as the Cultural Reviewer and Director of Stylistic Premonitions for UMN, and typically greeted listeners with a cheery &quot;Good hello!&quot; Bendix introduced listeners to &quot;squant&quot;, the fictitious &quot;fourth primary color&quot;, which was also the only primary color to have its own unique scent.

Among Joyce&#x27;s other characters were Dr. Oslo Norway, Dean of Psychiatric Broadcasting for UMN and Chairman of One World Advertising; local TV news anchor Leland Googleburger; Wang Tool, a lugubrious computerized voice stationed on the moon; and Izzy Isn&#x27;t, who &quot;hosted&quot; the show for the last few years of Joyce&#x27;s life. Leidecker continues this roleplaying practice by having his character Mike Worm, aspiring President of General Injectables and Signals, &quot;host&quot; the show or make announcements.

==Discography with Negativland==
Since the 1980s, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; has also been an outlet for Negativland&#x27;s creativity. The group participated in many of the shows, a few of which have been released as edited-down cassettes and CDs:

*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 1: JAMCON&#x27;84&quot; (1985)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 1½: The Starting Line with Dick Goodbody&quot; (1995, partial reissue)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 2: Pastor Dick: Muriel&#x27;s Purse Fund&quot; (1990)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 3: The Weatherman&#x27;s Dumb Stupid Come-Out Line&quot; (1990)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 4: Dick Vaughn&#x27;s Moribund Music of the &#x27;70s&quot; (2001, expanded reissue)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 5: Crosley Bendix Radio Reviews&quot; (1993)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 6: The Willsaphone Stupid Show&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 7: Time Zones Exchange Project&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Over the Edge Vol. 8: Sex Dirt&quot; (1995)
*&quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head FM: Over the Edge Live on Stage&quot; (2006)
*&quot;The Chopping Channel&quot; (2016) This release featured some of Joyce&#x27;s last work, and included a small bag of Joyce&#x27;s cremated ashes.

==Beyond the edge==
Don Joyce died of heart failure on July 22, 2015. After a tribute special, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; continued with fellow Negativlander Jon Leidecker (&quot;Wobbly&quot;) and KPFA&#x27;s Robert Cole (&quot;KrOB&quot;) at the helm. Leidecker plays the best of Joyce&#x27;s work, including surprises from Don&#x27;s cache of tapes discovered after his death, plus electronic and experimental music and new sound collage from Leidecker, Hosler and the rest of the group. Two shows per month are hosted by KrOB, who is developing his own following. Leidecker wanted to change the name of the show to reflect its evolution, and called it &quot;Over The Edge Presents&quot; until April 24, 2020, when it reverted to its original title. 

Joyce&#x27;s assistants had been working for several years on digitizing all the &quot;Over the Edge&quot; tapes and arranged to store them on the Internet Archive for free download. Uploads of this material began in late October 2015, and almost 1300 shows are now available. The goal is to collect tapes of every show ever done, and possibly to archive Leidecker&#x27;s broadcasts as well. At present, these can be heard and downloaded at Over the Edge Radio and more recent shows (from 2015 to 2017, many Leidecker&#x27;s and Cole&#x27;s) at Index of OTE Files. (Normally found at Negativland&#x27;s website, a recent redesign omitted the Index page for their archived shows.) The show is also archived in low-resolution audio format at KPFA: the most recent episodes can be heard and downloaded there.

Several shows inspired by &quot;Over the Edge&quot; can be heard on independent and community stations across the country. KMUZ&#x27;s &quot;Mid-Valley Mutations&quot; creator Austin Rich specifically cites Negativland and &quot;Over the Edge&quot; as inspiration for his own work: &quot;This band and their radio show have been a focal point for the kind of work I want to create, and has guided my attitudes toward culture and art for my entire adult life.&quot;

Following Joyce&#x27;s death, Filmmaker Ryan Worsley directed an 80-minute documentary, &quot;How Radio Isn&#x27;t Done&quot;, featuring surviving members of Negativland as well as archival footage of Joyce himself.

<doc id="481098" wikidata="Q35808" url="?curid=481098" title="Firewood">
<text>Firewood is any wooden material that is gathered and used for fuel. Generally, firewood is not heavily processed, and is in some sort of recognizable log or branch form, compared to other forms of wood fuel like pellets. Firewood can be seasoned and heat treated (dry) or unseasoned (fresh/wet). It is generally classified as either hardwood or softwood.
Firewood is a renewable resource. However, demand for this fuel can outpace its ability to regenerate on a local or regional level. Good forestry practices and improvements in devices that use firewood can improve local wood supplies.

Smoke from fire created by burning wood causes respiratory and other diseases. Moreover, transporting firewood long distances can potentially spread plant pests/diseases and invasive species.

==History==

For most of human history, firewood was the main fuel, until the use of coal spread during the Industrial Revolution. As such, access to firewood was a valued resource, with wood botes or the right to gather firewood, being a significant aspect of many medieval leases. As late as 19th century America, Thoreau considered that it was “remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and this country...the prince and the peasant, the scholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food”.

==Harvesting==
Harvesting or collecting firewood varies by the region and culture. Some places have specific areas for firewood collection. Other places may integrate the collection of firewood in the cycle of preparing a plot of land to grow food as part of a field rotation process. Collection can be a group, or an individual activity. The tools and methods for harvesting firewood are diverse.
===North America===
Some firewood is harvested in &quot;woodlots&quot; managed for that purpose, but in heavily wooded areas it is more often harvested as a byproduct of natural forests. Deadfall that has not started to rot is preferred, since it is already partly seasoned. Standing dead timber is considered better still, for it has less humid organic material on the trunk, allowing tools to stay sharper longer, as well as being both seasoned and less rotten. Harvesting this form of timber reduces the speed and intensity of bushfires, but it also reduces habitat for snag-nesting animals such as owls, bats, and some rodents.

Harvesting timber for firewood is normally carried out by hand with chainsaws. Thus, longer pieces, requiring less manual labour, and less chainsaw fuel – are less expensive and only limited by the size of the firebox. In most of the United States, the standard measure of firewood is a cord or , however, firewood can also be sold by weight. The heating value can affect the price. Prices also vary considerably with the distance from wood lots, and quality of the wood.

Buying and burning firewood that was cut only a short distance from its final destination prevents the accidental spread of invasive tree-killing insects and diseases.

=== Nigeria ===
Firewood/fuelwood in Nigeria is used for various purposes due to its availability and affordability. The excessive demand for fuel wood places immense pressure on forest resources, leading to the depletion of woodlands and the disruption of delicate ecosystems. Furthermore, deforestation exacerbates climate change by releasing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.

Here are some common uses of fuel wood in Nigeria:

# Cooking: Fuel wood serves as a primary source of energy for cooking in many households and commercial outlets across Nigeria. It is used in traditional stoves or open fires to prepare meals and heat food. Many living below one dollar per day use firewood for cooking.
# Heating: In colder regions or during colder seasons, fuel wood is used for heating purposes. It provides warmth in homes and can be used in fireplaces or traditional heating devices.
# Small-scale industries and Artisanal activities: Fuel wood is often utilized by small-scale industries for various production processes. Examples include baking and food processing, pottery making, brick-making, and blacksmithing. In rural areas, fuel wood is used for artisanal activities such as carving, woodworking, and crafting traditional items.
# Charcoal production: Fuel wood is also a key raw material for charcoal production. Charcoal, derived from the carbonization of wood, is used for cooking, heating, and industrial processes.
# Cultural and religious practices: Fuel wood plays a role in cultural and religious practices in Nigeria. It is used for traditional ceremonies, rituals, and religious ceremonies involving fire. Students also use it to do bonfire, night parties and so on. The traditionalists that do masquerade at night uses fire wood to warm themselves and roast meats like goat or chicken for enjoyment.

==Preparing==
In most parts of the world, firewood is only prepared for transport at the time it is harvested. Then it is moved closer to the place where it will be used as fuel and prepared (split, seasoned, etc...) there. The process of making charcoal from firewood can take place at the place the firewood is harvested.

Most firewood also requires splitting, which also allows for faster seasoning by exposing more surface area. Today, most splitting is done with a hydraulic splitting machine, but it can also be split with a splitting maul or a wedge and sledge hammer. Some steel wedges have an angled blade so the mechanical advantage increases with depth. More unusual, and dangerous, is a tapered screw-style design, that augers into the wood, splitting it, and can be powered by either a power take-off drive, a dedicated internal combustion engine, or a rugged electric pipe-threading machine, which is safer than the other power sources because the power can be shut off more easily if necessary. Another method is to use a kinetic log splitter, which uses a rack and pinion system powered by a small motor and a large flywheel used for energy storage.

==Storing==

There are many ways to store firewood. These range from simple piles to free-standing stacks, to specialized structures. Usually the goal of storing wood is to keep water away from it and to continue the drying process.

Stacks: The simplest stack is where logs are placed next to and on top of each other, forming a line the width of the logs. The height of the stack can vary, generally depending upon how the ends are constructed. Without constructing ends, the length of the log and length of the pile help determine the height of a free-standing stack.

There is debate about whether wood will dry more quickly when covered. There is a trade-off between the surface of the wood getting wet vs. allowing as much wind and sun as possible to access the stack. A cover can be almost any material that sheds water – a large piece of plywood, sheet metal, terracotta tiles, or an oiled canvas cloth, even cheap plastic sheeting may also be used. Wood will not dry when &quot;completely&quot; enclosed. Ideally pallets or scrap wood should be used to raise the wood from the ground, reducing rot and increasing air flow.

There are many ways to create the ends of a stack. In some areas, a crib end is created by alternating pairs of logs to help stabilize the end. A stake or pole placed in the ground is another way to end the pile. A series of stacked logs at the end, each with a cord tied to it and the free end of the cord wrapped to log in the middle of the pile, is another way.

Under a roof: Under a roof, there are no concerns about the wood being subjected to rain, snow or run-off, but ventilation needs to be provided if the wood is stored green so that moisture released from the wood does not recondense inside. The methods for stacking depend on the structure and layout desired. Whether split, or in &#x27;rounds&#x27; (flush-cut and unsplit segments of logs), the wood should be stacked lengthwise, which is the most stable and practical method. Again though, if the wood needs further seasoning there should be adequate air flow through the stack.

Storing outdoors: Firewood should be stacked with the bark facing upwards. This allows the water to drain off, and standing frost, ice, or snow to be kept from the wood. Storing wood near a dwelling increases the likelihood that insects such as termites can become established indoors.

Storing firewood indoors for any extended period of time is not recommended, for it increases the risk of introducing insects such as termites into the home.

Round stacks can be made many ways. Some are piles of wood with a stacked circular wall around them. Others like the American Holz Hausen are more complicated. A Holz hausen, or &quot;wood house&quot;, is a circular method of stacking wood; proponents say it speeds up drying on a relatively small footprint. A traditional holz hausen has a 10-foot diameter, stands 10 feet high, and holds about 6 cords of wood. The walls are made of pieces arranged radially, and tilted slightly inward for stability. The inside pieces are stacked on end to form a chimney for air flow. The top pieces are tilted slightly outward to shed rain and are placed bark side up.

== Heating value ==
The moisture content of firewood determines how it burns and how much heat is released. Unseasoned (green) wood moisture content varies by the species; green wood may weigh 70 to 100 percent more than seasoned wood due to water content. Typically, seasoned (dry) wood has 20% or less moisture content. Use of the lower heating value is advised as a reasonable standard way of reporting this data.

The energy content of a measure of wood depends on the tree species. For example, it can range from . The higher the moisture content, the more energy that must be used to evaporate (boil) the water in the wood before it will burn. Dry wood delivers more energy for heating than green wood of the same species.

The Sustainable Energy Development Office (SEDO), part of the Government of Western Australia states that the energy content of wood is 4.5 kWh/kg or 16.2 gigajoules/tonne (GJ/t).

Here are some examples of energy content of several species of wood:


===Kiln (oven) dried firewood===

To reduce the drying time to a number of days from the normal one to three years, an external heating source such as a kiln or oven can be used. The process of kiln or oven drying firewood was invented by Anthony Cutara, for which a successful US patent was filed in 1983. In 1987 the US Department of Agriculture replicated the method and published a detailed procedure for the production of kiln dried firewood, citing the higher heat output and increased combustion efficiency as a key benefit of the process.

==Measurement==
Usually firewood is sold by volume. While a specific volume term may be used, there can be a wide variation in what this means and what the measure can produce as a fuel. A measure of green unseasoned wood with 65% moisture contains less usable energy than when it has been dried to 20%. Regardless of the term, firewood measurement is best thought of as an estimate.

===Traditional English===
Early modern England measured firewood in terms of billets and bavins. A billet, like a bavin, was a piece of kindling wood. The 16th C standardised a billet as three foot four inches in length, and ten inches around (for open fires); and a bavin as three foot long and two feet round (a chunkier log, often used for ovens).

===Metric===
In the metric system, firewood is usually sold by the stère, equivalent to a volume of . The most common firewood piece length are and . Wood can also be sold by the kilogram or by the tonne, as in Australia.

===North America===
In the United States and Canada, firewood is usually sold by the full cord, face cord or bag. A cord which is made from logs will not be a cord when it has been cut into 1 foot logs and then split so each piece will fit through a circle.

*A full cord or bush cord has a volume of , including wood, bark, and air space in a neatly stacked pile. The actual wood volume of a cord may be in the range of as stacked wood takes up more space than a piece of solid wood. The most common firewood piece length is . 
* The volume of a face cord or a rick depends on the length of the logs that are stacked in a pile. When logs are used, the volume is which is one third of a full or bush cord stack of wood.

==Damage to health and environment==
Burning firewood causes respiratory and other illnesses. Along with clearance for agriculture collecting firewood is a cause of deforestation.

==In popular culture==
*Jane Austen in 1814 complained to her sister that “My Mother’s Wood is brought in-but by some mistake, no Bavins. She must therefore buy some”. (Contemporary charges were between 6 and 15 shillings per hundred bavins).
*In Norway, the non-fiction book &quot;Hel Ved&quot; (In English: &quot;Solid Wood: All About Chopping, Drying and Stacking Wood – and the Soul of Wood-Burning&quot;) by Lars Mytting became a bestseller in 2011–2012, selling 150,000 copies. A version of the book has also been published in Sweden, selling 50,000 copies.
* In February 2013, the Norwegian state broadcast NRK sent a 12-hour live program on the topic of firewood, where a large part of the program consisted of showing firewood burning in a fireplace. More than one million people, 20% of Norway&#x27;s population, saw part of the program.

<text>Adam Hochschild ( ; born October 5, 1942) is an American author, journalist, historian and lecturer. His best-known works include &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1998), &quot;To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918&quot; (2011), &quot;Bury the Chains&quot; (2005), &quot;The Mirror at Midnight&quot; (1990), &quot;The Unquiet Ghost&quot; (1994), and &quot;Spain in Our Hearts&quot; (2016).

==Biography==
Adam Hochschild was born in New York City. His father, Harold Hochschild, was of German Jewish descent; his mother, Mary Marquand Hochschild, was of English and Scottish descent and the daughter of pioneering art historian Allan Marquand, and an uncle by marriage, Boris Sergievsky, was a World War I fighter pilot in the Imperial Russian Air Force. His German-born paternal grandfather Berthold Hochschild co-founded the mining firm American Metal Company.

Hochschild graduated from Harvard in 1963 with a BA in History and Literature. As a college student, he spent a summer working on an anti-government newspaper in South Africa and subsequently worked briefly as a civil rights worker in Mississippi during 1964. Both were politically pivotal experiences about which he would eventually write in his books &quot;Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son&quot; and &quot;Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels.&quot; He later was part of the movement against the Vietnam War, and, after several years as a daily newspaper reporter, worked as a writer and editor for the left-wing &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine. In 1976, he was a co-founder of &quot;Mother Jones&quot;. Much of his writing has been about issues of human rights and social justice.

A longtime lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, Hochschild has also been a Fulbright Lecturer in India, Regents&#x27; Lecturer at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Writer-in-Residence at the Department of History, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is married to sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild.

He lives in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;writersdigest/hochschild&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

===Books===
Hochschild&#x27;s first book was a memoir, &quot;Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son&quot; (1986), in which he described the difficult relationship he had with his father. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Michiko Kakutani called the book &quot;an extraordinarily moving portrait of the complexities and confusions of familial love.&quot;

In &quot;The Mirror at Midnight: A South African Journey&quot; (1990; new edition, 2007) he examines the tensions of modern South Africa through the prism of the nineteenth-century Battle of Blood River, which determined whether the Boers or the Zulus would control that part of the world, as well as looking at the contentious commemoration of the event by rival groups 150 years later, at the height of the apartheid era.

In &quot;The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin&quot; (1994; new edition, 2003), Hochschild chronicles the six months he spent in Russia, traveling to Siberia and the Arctic, interviewing gulag survivors, retired concentration camp guards, former members of the secret police and countless others about Joseph Stalin&#x27;s reign of terror in the country, during which hundreds of thousands of people died.

Hochschild&#x27;s &quot;Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;publishersweekly/9780815604471&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kirkusreviews/trapdoor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (1997) collects his personal essays and shorter pieces of reportage, as does a more recent collection, &quot;Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays&quot; (2018)

His &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa&quot; (1998; new edition, 2006) is a history of the conquest of the Congo by King Léopold II of Belgium, and of the atrocities that were committed under Leopold&#x27;s private rule of the colony, events that led to the twentieth century&#x27;s first great international human rights campaign. The book reignited interest and inquiry into Leopold&#x27;s colonial regime in the Congo, but was met by some hostility in Belgium. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″ review at the time of the book&#x27;s first edition, the book &quot;brought howls of rage from Belgium&#x27;s ageing colonials and some professional historians even as it has climbed the country&#x27;s best-seller lists.&quot;

Hochschild&#x27;s &quot;Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire&#x27;s Slaves&quot; (2005) is about the antislavery movement in Britain. The story of how abolitionists organized to change the opinions of and bring greater awareness to the British public about slavery has attracted attention from contemporary climate change activists, who see an analogy to their own work.

In 2011, Hochschild published &quot;To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918&quot;, which considers the First World War in terms of the struggle between those who felt the war was a noble crusade and those who felt it was not worth the sacrifice of millions of lives. His 2016 &quot;Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939&quot; follows a dozen characters through that conflict, among them volunteer soldiers and medical workers, journalists who covered the war, and a little-known American oilman who sold Francisco Franco most of the fuel for his military. &quot;Rebel Cinderella: From Rags to Riches to Radical, the Epic Journey of Rose Pastor Stokes&quot;, was published in 2020, and his latest, &quot;American Midnight: The Great War, a Violent Peace, and Democracy&#x27;s Forgotten Crisis&quot;, in 2022. Hochschild&#x27;s books have been translated into seventeen languages.

===Journalism===
Hochschild has also written for the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Granta&quot;, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot; and other publications. He was also a commentator on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

<doc id="481100" wikidata="Q4751162" url="?curid=481100" title="Analyticity of holomorphic functions">
<text>In complex analysis, a complex-valued function formula_1 of a complex variable formula_2:

*is said to be holomorphic at a point formula_3 if it is differentiable at every point within some open disk centered at formula_3, and
* is said to be analytic at formula_3 if in some open disk centered at formula_3 it can be expanded as a convergent power series formula_7 (this implies that the radius of convergence is positive).

One of the most important theorems of complex analysis is that holomorphic functions are analytic and vice versa. Among the corollaries of this theorem are

* the identity theorem that two holomorphic functions that agree at every point of an infinite set formula_8 with an accumulation point inside the intersection of their domains also agree everywhere in every connected open subset of their domains that contains the set formula_8, and
* the fact that, since power series are infinitely differentiable, so are holomorphic functions (this is in contrast to the case of real differentiable functions), and
* the fact that the radius of convergence is always the distance from the center formula_3 to the nearest non-removable singularity; if there are no singularities (i.e., if formula_1 is an entire function), then the radius of convergence is infinite. Strictly speaking, this is not a corollary of the theorem but rather a by-product of the proof.
* no bump function on the complex plane can be entire. In particular, on any connected open subset of the complex plane, there can be no bump function defined on that set which is holomorphic on the set. This has important ramifications for the study of complex manifolds, as it precludes the use of partitions of unity. In contrast the partition of unity is a tool which can be used on any real manifold.

== Proof ==

The argument, first given by Cauchy, hinges on Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula and the power series expansion of the expression

: formula_12

Let formula_13 be an open disk centered at formula_3 and suppose formula_1 is differentiable everywhere within an open neighborhood containing the closure of formula_13. Let formula_17 be the positively oriented (i.e., counterclockwise) circle which is the boundary of formula_13 and let formula_2 be a point in formula_13. Starting with Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, we have

: formula_21

Interchange of the integral and infinite sum is justified by observing that formula_22 is bounded on formula_17 by some positive number formula_24, while for all formula_25 in formula_17

: formula_27

for some positive formula_28 as well. We therefore have

: formula_29

on formula_17, and as the Weierstrass M-test shows the series converges uniformly over formula_17, the sum and the integral may be interchanged.

As the factor formula_32 does not depend on the variable of integration formula_25, it may be factored out to yield

: formula_34

which has the desired form of a power series in formula_2:

: formula_36

with coefficients

: formula_37

== Remarks ==
* Since power series can be differentiated term-wise, applying the above argument in the reverse direction and the power series expression for formula_38 gives formula_39 This is a Cauchy integral formula for derivatives. Therefore the power series obtained above is the Taylor series of formula_1.
* The argument works if formula_2 is any point that is closer to the center formula_3 than is any singularity of formula_1. Therefore, the radius of convergence of the Taylor series cannot be smaller than the distance from formula_3 to the nearest singularity (nor can it be larger, since power series have no singularities in the interiors of their circles of convergence).
* A special case of the identity theorem follows from the preceding remark. If two holomorphic functions agree on a (possibly quite small) open neighborhood formula_45 of formula_3, then they coincide on the open disk formula_47, where formula_48 is the distance from formula_3 to the nearest singularity.

<text>Maybe You Should Drive is the second studio album by Barenaked Ladies. It was released in August 1994 and went double platinum in Canada, reaching No. 3 upon its release. It was also their first album to chart in the US, peaking at No. 175 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Unlike on their previous album &quot;Gordon&quot;, Steven Page and Ed Robertson did not collaborate as frequently.

As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Intermittently&quot;, completely naked. Tracks cut from the album include &quot;Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Trust Me&quot;, both of which were later re-recorded for &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot;; the former was re-worked and appeared on that album, while the latter was cut again, and appeared as a B-side on the &quot;Shoe Box EP&quot;.

Of the recording session, Page said &quot;We did most of the last record in Burnaby, a cold and industrial wasteland, with a huge budget we really didn&#x27;t need [...] All a huge budget does is put you further in debt. Imagine if they raised your VISA limit to $5,000 and then you had to give your card to a professional shopper — let&#x27;s call him a producer in the case — and he said, &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s spend the whole thing.&#x27;&quot;

Page added that keyboardist/percussionist Andy Creeggan considered leaving the band during album rehearsals, but was convinced to stay for its completion and subsequent promotional tour. Creeggan did indeed depart the band and entered McGill University&#x27;s music program. He has since recorded four albums with his brother Jim (who is also bassist for Barenaked Ladies) under the name The Brothers Creeggan.

== Retrospective analysis ==
In a 2016 interview with Toronto radio station Boom 97.3, Stephen Page remarked that the album remained one of his favourite Barenaked Ladies records. Conversely, in an interview with VICE that same year, Ed Robertson stated that it was &quot;easily&quot; his least favourite of the band&#x27;s records. Robertson cited &quot;fractured&quot; dynamics and communication issues within the group; the difficulty of following up the success of their previous album, &quot;Gordon&quot;; and difficulty dealing with the 1993 death of his brother as factors that made it difficult for him to feel attached to the songs on the album.

<text>Tiglath-Pileser II (from the Hebraic form of Akkadian &quot;Tukultī-apil-Ešarra&quot;) was King of Assyria from 967 BCE, when he succeeded his father Ashur-resh-ishi II, until his death in 935 BCE, when he was succeeded by his son Ashur-dan II. Little is known about his reign.

==History==
Tiglath-Pileser II waged numerous successful military campaigns, including against the Babylonians, the Arameans, and the Hittites. He conquered the region of Nairi, which lay between Assyria and Urartu, and gained control of the lucrative trade routes that passed through the area.

Tiglath-Pileser II also reorganized the Assyrian army and introduced new military tactics and weapons. He established a standing army that was well-equipped and well-trained, which allowed him to maintain control over his empire and to expand it further.

In addition to his military conquests, Tiglath-Pileser II made significant political reforms. He reorganized the administrative structure of the Assyrian Empire and introduced a system of provincial governors, who were responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order in their regions. He also standardized weights, measures, and currency throughout the empire, which facilitated trade and commerce.

Tiglath-Pileser II is remembered as one of the most powerful and influential kings of Assyria. His military and political reforms laid the foundation for the later Assyrian Empire, which would become one of the most formidable empires of the ancient world.

<text>Tiglath-Pileser I (; from the Hebraic form of , &quot;my trust is in the son of Ešarra&quot;) was a king of Assyria during the Middle Assyrian period (1114–1076 BC). According to Georges Roux, Tiglath-Pileser was &quot;one of the two or three great Assyrian monarchs since the days of Shamshi-Adad I&quot;. He was known for his &quot;wide-ranging military campaigns, his enthusiasm for building projects, and his interest in cuneiform tablet collections&quot;. Under him, Assyria became the leading power of the Ancient Near East, a position the kingdom largely maintained for the next five hundred years. He expanded Assyrian control into Anatolia and Syria, and to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From his surviving inscriptions, he seems to have carefully cultivated a fear of himself in his subjects and in his enemies alike.

The beginning of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s I reign had heavy involvement in military campaigns, as suggested from translated texts from the Middle Assyrian period. The texts were believed to be &quot;justification of war.&quot; Although little literary text is available from the time of Tiglath-Pileser I, there is evidence to show that the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I inspired the act of recording information, including that of his military campaigns. Toward the end of Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s reign literary texts took the form of &quot;summary texts&quot; which served as a vessel for as much information about his reign as possible, with the intent to be handed down to his successor.

==Campaigns==
The son of Ashur-resh-ishi I, he ascended to the throne in 1115 BC, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors. Tiglath-Pileser I referred to himself as &quot;unrivalled king of the universe, king of the four quarters, king of all princes, lord of lords… whose weapons the god Assur has sharpened and whose name he has pronounced eternally for control of the four quarters… splendid flame which covers the hostile land like a rain storm&quot;. Alongside this view of himself, he emphasized the brutality of his takeover of numerous lands, and was the first Assyrian king to claim hostages, occasionally children, as a political instrument against conquered peoples.

His first campaign was against the Mushku in 1112 BC, who had occupied certain Assyrian districts in the Upper Euphrates; then he overran Commagene and eastern Cappadocia, and drove the Hittites from the Assyrian province of Subartu, northeast of Malatia.

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated into the mountains south of Lake Van and then turned westward to receive the submission of Malatia. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser attacked Comana in Cappadocia, and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his Cilician conquests.

The Arameans emerged in a region which was largely under the domination of the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC) and quickly posed a threat to the Assyrian polity which was largely located west of the Euphrates. In order to nullify this threat, Tiglath-Pileser I performed many campaigns in Aramean territory, although the numerous campaigns that the Assyrian records recorded that he took indicate that Assyrian military campaigns were unsuccessful at exercising power or dominance over the Arameans. Some scholars believe that the Arameans took Nineveh in this time. In the 11th century BC, Assyria fell into decline which may have been caused by the incursions of the emerging Arameans, allowing the Arameans to establish a string of states across the Levant and make notable expansions into Assyrian territory in this time such as in the Khabur Valley. For the time being, Assyria was unable to expand east of the Euphrates.

The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of Pitru at the junction between the Euphrates and Sajur; thence he proceeded to &quot;Gubal&quot; (Byblos), Sidon, and finally to Arvad where he embarked onto a ship to sail the Mediterranean, on which he killed a &quot;nahiru&quot; or &quot;sea-horse&quot; (which A. Leo Oppenheim translates as a narwhal) in the sea. 

The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods Ashur and Hadad at Assyrian capital of Assur was one of his initiatives. It is also believed he was one of the first Assyrian kings to commission parks and gardens with foreign trees and plants.

The latter part of his reign seems to have been a period of retrenchment, as Aramaean tribesmen put pressure on his realm. He died in 1076 BC and was succeeded by his son Asharid-apal-Ekur. The later kings Ashur-bel-kala and Shamshi-Adad IV were also his sons.

=== Annals and texts ===
Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s I inscriptions from his &quot;fifth year annals&quot; varied in form, from inscriptions on prisms to cuneiform inscriptions on tablets. A.0.87.i (or &quot;RIMA&quot; 2) was inscribed on a multiple 8-sided prisms and included 6 military campaigns that Marco De Odorico affirms as easily identifiable given that &quot;the subdivision of paragraphs by horizontal lines... as well as the introduction begin with &#x27;in my succession year&#x27;&quot;.

Considering that much of Tiglath-Pileser I&#x27;s reign involved military campaigns, it is unsurprising that most of his literary texts would include such information as &quot;Altogether I conquered 42 lands and their rulers from the other side of the Lower Zab in distant mountainous regions to the other side of the Euphrates, people of Hatti, and the Upper Sea in the west – from my accession year to my fifth regnal year.&quot; Tiglath-Pileser I&#x27;s prism was essentially a year-by-year layout of his military campaigns, and today is considered one of the world&#x27;s first-preserved annals.

=== Returning from the campaigns ===
Tiglath-Pileser I&#x27;s annals contain military campaign documentation, as well as other information such as what Tiglath-Pileser I would bring back in an early form of tribute, from the various locations he showed military strength over. Once returned from a successful war campaign Tiglath-Pileser I is said to have had statues of the various animals he had come into contact with as well as hunted. From the translated annals text, it is said that Tiglath-Pileser I had &quot;2 nāhirū (horse of the sea)  sculptures, 4 burhiš sculptures, 4 lions constructed of basalt, 2 bull colossi made of alabaster, 2 burhiš sculptures made of white limestone and had them set up at the gates in the City of Ashur&quot;

These statues were mainly used to decorate the &quot;royal entrance&quot;, a practice that was taken up by Tiglath-Pileser I&#x27;s son Aššur-bel-kala after his father&#x27;s passing. In addition to erecting statues of animals his people had never seen, Tiglath-Pileser I returned from some war campaigns with the living animals themselves, including calves of wild bulls as well as elephants.

<doc id="481108" wikidata="Q262682" url="?curid=481108" title="Howard Pawley">
<text>Howard Russell Pawley (November 21, 1934 – December 30, 2015) was a Canadian politician and professor who was the 18th premier of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988. Prior to his premiership, Pawley served in various ministerial positions after his tenure in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

==Early life==
The son of Methodist parents, Pawley was born in Brampton, Ontario, moved to Winnipeg at the age of 17 and was educated at Manitoba Teachers College, United College and the Manitoba Law School. In 1960, he married Adele Schreyer, a cousin of Edward Schreyer, who served as Premier of Manitoba from 1969 to 1977.

==Early career==
Pawley worked as a lawyer and educator, and was active in the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and its successor, the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP). In 1957, Pawley was elected President of the Manitoba CCF, becoming at the age of 22, the youngest President in the party&#x27;s history. He opposed the transformation of the CCF into the NDP in 1961, but this decision did not hurt his subsequent career in the party.

==Political career==

===Political beginnings (1957-68)===
Pawley first ran for public office in the 1957 Canadian federal election as the CCF candidate in the riding of Lisgar, finishing fourth with 443 votes. In the Manitoba 1958 provincial election, he ran in the northern riding of The Pas and received 801 votes, finishing third. In both these elections he ran as a sacrificial candidate while working as an organizer for the Manitoba CCF. Later, in the 1965 federal election, he ran in the Selkirk riding and received a more respectable 4,456 votes, finishing third.

===Legislative years (1969-88)===
In the 1969 provincial election, Pawley was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the constituency of Selkirk, a mixed urban/rural seat to the north of Winnipeg. He was immediately promoted to Edward Schreyer&#x27;s cabinet and was sworn in as Minister of Government Services and Minister of Municipal Affairs on July 15, 1969. He stood down from the former position on December 18, 1969, but retained the latter until September 22, 1976. In addition to his cabinet duties, Pawley also chaired a committee that brought forward public auto insurance legislation for the province, and he was the first Chair and Minister responsible for the Manitoba public Insurance Corporation (1971–1973).

===Attorney-General of Manitoba (1973-77)===
On September 4, 1973, Pawley was promoted to Attorney-General. After stepping down as Municipal Affairs minister in 1976, he was given the additional responsibility of administering the Liquor Control Act.

===Premier of Manitoba (1981-88)===
In 1979, Pawley replaced Schreyer as leader of the provincial NDP. He was initially elected leader by the party caucus on an interim basis and later defeated Muriel Smith and Russell Doern at the subsequent leadership convention. Like Schreyer, he was from the northeast of the province and could appeal to voters beyond the CCF/NDP&#x27;s traditional Winnipeg base. In the 1981 election, the NDP, led by Pawley, defeated the Progressive Conservative government of Sterling Lyon. That was the first time in the province&#x27;s history that any party had ever been voted out of office after only one term.

Pawley was sworn in as Premier of Manitoba on November 30, 1981. His government reintroduced and entrenched French-language rights that had been removed by the Thomas Greenway government in 1890, but he was forced to withdraw proposed legislation that would further extend French language services in the face of widespread opposition among the public. That issue nearly caused the Pawley government&#x27;s defeat at the polls in the 1986 provincial election.

On the economic front, the Pawley government&#x27;s record was at or near the top in provincial comparison in respect to investment and employment growth and often enjoyed the lowest unemployment rate anywhere in Canada, and it sustained the province&#x27;s social programs during the recession of the early 1980s. His government launched the giant Limestone hydro generating project and negotiated major export agreements of hydro electricity to the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. However, that was not without an economic price, as the Pawley government routinely delivered budgets with large deficits and balanced the budget only at the very end of its term.

On the social front, the Pawley government enacted changes to labour legislation including pay equity, final-offer selection, and first-contract legislation. It also introduced changes to the Human Rights Code to include the addition of the words &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

Pawley&#x27;s NDP was reduced to a narrow majority in 1986, with the party winning 30 of 57 seats. His government would become increasingly unpopular with the electorate over the next two years, primarily because of a jump in auto insurance premiums in 1987 and massive multimillion-dollar losses at MTX, a subsidiary of the Crown-owned Manitoba Telephone System, which had been formed to invest in telecommunications in Saudi Arabia.

The NDP&#x27;s position became even more precarious when longtime minister Laurent Desjardins resigned from cabinet in early 1988 and stopped attending legislative sessions, effectively reducing Pawley&#x27;s majority to one seat. This proved critical that March when backbench NDP MLA and former Speaker Jim Walding voted against the government&#x27;s budget and toppled the government.

Pawley resigned as party leader and did not run in the subsequent election, which was won by the Progressive Conservatives, led by Gary Filmon.

In his last years as premier, Pawley had become a prominent figure on the national stage as an opponent of free trade as well as a party to the Meech Lake Constitutional Accord. No longer in provincial politics, Pawley again ran as a candidate for the federal NDP in the 1988 federal election for the riding of Selkirk, but was defeated by the Progressive Conservative, candidate David Bjornson.

==Later career==
Pawley left politics and became a political science professor at the University of Windsor, where he taught until his retirement. In 2000, he was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and in 2001, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2001, he received the Cesar E. Chavez Award and in 2004, he was the recipient from the Manitoba NDP of the Lucille Ono Award. Pawley was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award, University of Winnipeg, in 2008. He was the recipient of the 2008 Youth Parliament of Manitoba Alumni Achievement Award. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal NDP. Pawley served as vice-president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, an executive member of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, chair of the Harry Crowe Foundation, and vice-president of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. He also served as a board member of the Erie St. Clair Local Health Integration Network [LHIN].

At the University of Windsor, Pawley served as an Associate Professor (1990–2000) and also served as the Paul Martin Professor (1993-1998). He also served as the President (1999-2000) of the Windsor University Faculty Association (WUFA). Later, he served as the Stanley Knowles professor at the University of Waterloo in 2000 and visiting professor to the University of Washington, in Seattle, during the springs of 2001 and 2003. Pawley was acting director of the Centre for Studies in Social Justice at the University of Windsor (2006-2007) and was an associate professor emeritus at the University of Windsor.

Pawley was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation that campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

==Death==
Pawley died in a hospital in Windsor, Ontario, from a short illness on December 30, 2015, at the age of 81.

<doc id="481110" wikidata="Q1161215" url="?curid=481110" title="Daniel J. O'Donnell">
<text>Daniel J. O&#x27;Donnell (born November 17, 1960) is an American politician from the state of New York. A Democrat, he is a member of the New York State Assembly. O&#x27;Donnell represented the 69th district in Manhattan, made up of the neighborhoods of Manhattan Valley, Morningside Heights, and portions of the Upper West Side and West Harlem.

O&#x27;Donnell was the legislative sponsor of the Marriage Equality Act during its successful passage and signature into law on June 24, 2011. In 2010, he ushered in the passage of the anti-bullying Dignity for All Students Act. More recently, he led the charge to repeal 50-A and the gay panic defense and authored legislation making all public, single-occupancy bathrooms gender-neutral.

==Early life and education==
Born in Flushing, Queens, O&#x27;Donnell is one of five siblings. He is the brother of entertainer Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Raised in Commack, New York on Long Island, he attended The Catholic University of America before transferring to George Washington University for his Bachelor of Arts. O&#x27;Donnell received a Juris Doctor from the CUNY School of Law at Queens College.

==Career==
After graduating law school in 1984, O&#x27;Donnell worked for seven years as a public defender in the criminal defense division of Brooklyn&#x27;s Legal Aid Society before opening his own law firm on the Upper West Side. His community practice helped clients with tenant representation, as well as civil rights litigation ranging from employee discrimination to First Amendment rights. Since 2002, he has represented the 69th District in the New York Assembly.

O&#x27;Donnell first ran for the legislature in 1998, making an unsuccessful bid for the New York State Senate in the 30th district; he lost the Democratic primary to Eric Schneiderman.

When Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan announced his retirement in 2002, O&#x27;Donnell was one of eight Democrats who entered the race to succeed him. In the crowded primary election held on September 10, 2002, O&#x27;Donnell won 34 percent of the vote, twice as much as his nearest competitor. In the general election that followed, he prevailed with 82 percent of the vote.

O&#x27;Donnell is the first openly gay man elected to the New York State Assembly.

O&#x27;Donnell ran uncontested in the 2008 and 2010 general elections. He was opposed in the September 13, 2016 Democratic Primary by Steven M. Appel, but won over 73% of the vote.

In 2008, O&#x27;Donnell was considered by New York Governor David Paterson to fill the Senate vacancy created by the appointment of Hillary Clinton as President Obama&#x27;s Secretary of State. Paterson ultimately appointed upstate Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand to the seat.

In 2019, O&#x27;Donnell sought the New York City Public Advocate seat being vacated by Letitia James, who had been elected for New York State attorney general. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by Jumaane Williams.

===Committees===

As of 2017, O&#x27;Donnell serves as Chair of the Assembly Committee on Tourism, Parks, Arts and Sports Development and Chair of the Subcommittee on Criminal Procedure. Previously, O&#x27;Donnell served as Chair of the Assembly Committee Corrections, Assembly Committee on Ethics and Guidance, as well as Chair of the Subcommittee on Criminal Procedure of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. He also serves on a number of full committees, namely:
*Committee on Codes
*Committee on Education
*Committee on Environmental Conservation
*Committee on Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force

===Legislation===
On June 19, 2007, O&#x27;Donnell ushered the Marriage Equality Act, a bill that would have legalized gay marriage in New York State, to passage by a vote of 85–61. Although the bill passed the Assembly and had the support of then-Governor Eliot Spitzer, the Republican-controlled State Senate did not take up the measure. O&#x27;Donnell once again led the fight for a same-sex marriage bill in 2009, shepherding it to passage twice more, by a vote of 89–52 in May, and by a vote of 88–51 in December. O&#x27;Donnell introduced the Marriage Equality bill in the Assembly for the 2011–2012 legislative session on May 10, 2011. The Marriage Equality Act was passed by the NYS Assembly on June 15, 2011, and passed the NYS Senate and was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo slightly before midnight on Friday, June 24, 2011.

O&#x27;Donnell was the prime sponsor of the Dignity for All Students Act, one of the first laws in New York history to explicitly include protections based on gender identity and expression. In 2019, New York enacted his legislation to ban the so-called gay and trans &quot;panic&quot; defense, which asks a jury to find that a victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity is to blame for a defendant&#x27;s violent reaction, including even murder. One year later, the legislature passed O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s bill requiring single-occupancy bathrooms to be gender-neutral with overwhelming bi-partisan support.

Beginning in 2017, O&#x27;Donnell introduced legislation to repeal 50-a, which prevents the public disclosure of police records. The legislation languished until 2020, when the murder of George Floyd renewed campaigns for repeal. On June 10, the New York State Legislature voted to repeal 50-a and on June 12, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed to repeal the law. The law repeals 50-a in its entiretyallowing individuals, lawyers, and the press to request police disciplinary files that have long been held in secret.

Additional legislative victories include: successfully lowering NYC speed limits to 25 mph; expanding sexual harassment protections to unpaid interns; mandating mental health discharge plans for incarcerated individuals; and passing the Domestic Violence Escalation Prevention Act, which bans individuals convicted of domestic violence from owning any type of firearm.

Assemblyman O&#x27;Donnell announced that he will not seek reelection to the New York State Assembly in November 2023 and will retire from election politics in January 2025.

==Controversy==
On May 23, 2023, Assemblyman Daniel O&#x27;Donnell made a comment to Assemblymember Catalina Cruz that offended her as the Assemblyman walked out of the committee meeting on codes chaired by Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz. The bill (sponsored by Assemblymember Amy Paulin) being debated was regarding police officers seizing guns owned by suspects during domestic violence situations. The members of the codes committee were also debating how many votes it needed to forward the bill out of committee onto the assembly floor for a vote. Cruz voted differently than O&#x27;Donnell. O&#x27;Donnell was sanctioned by Speaker Carl Heastie for his actions.

==Personal life==
In 2011, O&#x27;Donnell was featured in &quot;Out Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Out 100,&quot; the magazine&#x27;s list of the year&#x27;s 100 most inspiring individuals.

On January 29, 2012, O&#x27;Donnell married his partner of 31 years, John Banta. The ceremony and reception were attended by over 400 people including Governor Andrew Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, many of his colleagues from the Assembly and State Senate, family, and friends. The couple were married by Judith Kaye, the former chief justice of the state Court of Appeals.

He has been interviewed in periodicals for the &quot;Bear&quot; community.

<text>Big Rock Brewery is a Canadian public company and the largest brewery that is based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As of March 2020, it was also Canada&#x27;s largest craft brewery. Additional brewing operations are located in Vancouver, British Columbia; Etobicoke, Ontario; and Liberty Village in Toronto, Ontario. Big Rock distributes a variety of beers and ciders throughout Canada.

==History==
The brewery was founded in 1984, by Ed McNally, who was disappointed in the beer available to buy in Calgary, AB. A lawyer by trade, McNally was representing a group of barley growers in a legal action against the Alberta Wheat Board in the 1980s. Through the course of the legal action, McNally learned that the Alberta climate produces 2-row barley that is ideally suited for malting, and had access to glacial water from the nearby Rocky Mountains. At the time, most barley production in Alberta was used as cattle feed. With an entrepreneurial background, McNally decided to open a craft brewery. The name &quot;Big Rock&quot; was chosen after the Okotoks Erratic, a 16,500-tonne glacial boulder located outside of the town of Okotoks.

The first brewmaster was Bernd Pieper, a German brewmaster for Heineken International. In Summer 1986, when Big Rock had been in production for only a year, workers at the Molson and Labatt breweries went on strike. This proved to be a windfall for Big Rock, as it was the only beer available in Alberta that summer, and production quickly grew.

The second brewmaster was Larry Kerwin, a former brewmaster for Molson and current distiller at Eau Claire Distillery. Kerwin started as a brewer at Big Rock under Pieper in 1994, and took over as brewmaster in 2003 when Pieper retired. He was with Big Rock for 12 years.

The third brewmaster was Paul Gautreau. Gautreau joined Big Rock in 1986 as its fourth employee and worked in marketing and operational capacities before replacing Kerwin as brewmaster. Gautreau is a graduate of the Brewing and Packaging program at the University of California, Davis, the Brewing &amp; Malting Science program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the Institute of Brewing and Distilling in London, England. He is also a member of the American Society of Brewing Chemists, the Institute of Brewing and Distilling, and he has served as president of the Master Brewers Association of the Americas.

McNally retired from day-to-day operation of the company, retaining the ceremonial title &quot;Chairman Emeritus&quot; until his death in August 2014.

In March 2015, Big Rock&#x27;s Urban Brewery opened in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2017, Big Rock partnered with restaurateurs Oliver &amp; Bonacini to open Liberty Commons at Big Rock Brewery, located in Liberty Village, Toronto.

On July 23, 2018, Big Rock closed an amended transaction to acquire certain brewing assets and inventory related to branded beer and cider from the Fireweed Brewing Corporation, including beverage brands such as Tree Brewing, Dukes Cider, and Shaftebury.

==Products==
Big Rock brews 10 year-round beers, 5 ciders, as well as a number of seasonal offerings and limited edition lambic-style beers.

*Original Joe&#x27;s draft beers labels at their restaurants.

==Marketing==
===Big Rock Barn Burner concert series===
In 2017, Big Rock Brewery hosted the Barn Burner Concert at their Calgary brewery. The concert was held in the brewery parking lot and included live music, craft beer, and local food. Headliners included The Sheepdogs, Sam Roberts Band, and The Dead South. In 2018, they expanded the concert series to Toronto playing host to indie-folk group Mt. Joy.

===Big Rock Eddies===

From 1993 to 2016, the Big Rock Brewery Eddies were an annual event in Calgary that raised money for Calgary arts beneficiaries, including One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theatre, the Calgary Folk Music Festival, and the Epcor Centre for the Performing Arts (now Arts Commons). The Eddies were a promotional contest to encourage beer drinkers to make an advertisement for Big Rock. The contest later included a student category that allowed post-secondary students to compete with their peers for prize money.

<doc id="481119" wikidata="Q5891835" url="?curid=481119" title="Homotopy principle">
<text>In mathematics, the homotopy principle (or h-principle) is a very general way to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), and more generally partial differential relations (PDRs). The h-principle is good for underdetermined PDEs or PDRs, such as the immersion problem, isometric immersion problem, fluid dynamics, and other areas.

The theory was started by Yakov Eliashberg, Mikhail Gromov and Anthony V. Phillips. It was based on earlier results that reduced partial differential relations to homotopy, particularly for immersions. The first evidence of h-principle appeared in the Whitney–Graustein theorem. This was followed by the Nash–Kuiper isometric &quot;C&quot;1 embedding theorem and the Smale–Hirsch immersion theorem.

==Rough idea==

Assume we want to find a function formula_1 on formula_2 which satisfies a partial differential equation of degree formula_3, in coordinates formula_4. One can rewrite it as

:formula_5

where formula_6 stands for all partial derivatives of formula_1 up to order formula_3. Exchanging every variable in formula_6 for new independent variables formula_10 turns our equations into

:formula_11

and some number of equations of the type 
:formula_12

A solution of

:formula_11

is called a non-holonomic solution, and a solution of the system which is also solution of our original PDE is called a holonomic solution.

In order to check whether a solution to our original equation exists, one can first check if there is a non-holonomic solution. Usually this is quite easy, and if there is no non-holonomic solution, then our original equation did not have any solutions.

A PDE &quot;satisfies the formula_14-principle&quot; if any non-holonomic solution can be deformed into a holonomic one in the class of non-holonomic solutions. Thus in the presence of h-principle, a differential topological problem reduces to an algebraic topological problem. More explicitly this means that apart from the topological obstruction there is no other obstruction to the existence of a holonomic solution. The topological problem of finding a &quot;non-holonomic solution&quot; is much easier to handle and can be addressed with the obstruction theory for topological bundles.

While many underdetermined partial differential equations satisfy the h-principle, the falsity of one is also an interesting statement. Intuitively this means that the objects being studied have non-trivial geometry which can not be reduced to topology. As an example, embedded Lagrangians in a symplectic manifold do not satisfy an h-principle, to prove this one can for instance find invariants coming from pseudo-holomorphic curves.

== Simple examples ==

=== Monotone functions ===
Perhaps the simplest partial differential relation is for the derivative to not vanish: formula_15 Properly, this is an &quot;ordinary&quot; differential relation, as this is a function in one variable. 

A holonomic solution to this relation is a function whose derivative is nowhere vanishing, i.e. a strictly monotone differentiable function, either increasing or decreasing. The space of such functions consists of two disjoint convex sets: the increasing ones and the decreasing ones, and has the homotopy type of two points.

A non-holonomic solution to this relation would consist in the data of two functions, a differentiable function f(x), and a continuous function g(x), with g(x) nowhere vanishing. A holonomic solution gives rise to a non-holonomic solution by taking g(x) = f&#x27;(x). The space of non-holonomic solutions again consists of two disjoint convex sets, according as g(x) is positive or negative. 

Thus the inclusion of holonomic into non-holonomic solutions satisfies the h-principle. 
This trivial example has nontrivial generalizations:
extending this to immersions of a circle into itself classifies them by order (or winding number), by lifting the map to the universal covering space and applying the above analysis to the resulting monotone map – the linear map corresponds to multiplying angle: formula_16 (formula_17 in complex numbers). Note that here there are no immersions of order 0, as those would need to turn back on themselves. Extending this to circles immersed in the plane – the immersion condition is precisely the condition that the derivative does not vanish – the Whitney–Graustein theorem classified these by turning number by considering the homotopy class of the Gauss map and showing that this satisfies an h-principle; here again order 0 is more complicated.

Smale&#x27;s classification of immersions of spheres as the homotopy groups of Stiefel manifolds, and Hirsch&#x27;s generalization of this to immersions of manifolds being classified as homotopy classes of maps of frame bundles are much further-reaching generalizations, and much more involved, but similar in principle – immersion requires the derivative to have rank &quot;k,&quot; which requires the partial derivatives in each direction to not vanish and to be linearly independent, and the resulting analog of the Gauss map is a map to the Stiefel manifold, or more generally between frame bundles.

=== A car in the plane ===
As another simple example, consider a car moving in the plane. The position of a car in the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates formula_18 and formula_19 for the location (a good choice is the location of the midpoint between the back wheels) and an angle formula_20 which describes the orientation of the car. The motion of the car satisfies the equation

:formula_21
since a non-skidding car must move in the direction of its wheels. In robotics terms, not all paths in the task space are holonomic.

A non-holonomic solution in this case, roughly speaking, corresponds to a motion of the car by sliding in the plane. In this case the non-holonomic solutions are not only homotopic to holonomic ones but also can be arbitrarily well approximated by the holonomic ones (by going back and forth, like parallel parking in a limited space) – note that this approximates both the position and the angle of the car arbitrarily closely. This implies that, theoretically, it is possible to parallel park in any space longer than the length of your car. It also implies that, in a contact 3 manifold, any curve is formula_22-close to a Legendrian curve.
This last property is stronger than the general h-principle; it is called the formula_22-dense h-principle.

While this example is simple, compare to the Nash embedding theorem, specifically the Nash–Kuiper theorem, which says that any short smooth (formula_24) embedding or immersion of formula_25 in formula_26 or larger can be arbitrarily well approximated by an isometric formula_27-embedding (respectively, immersion). This is also a dense h-principle, and can be proven by an essentially similar &quot;wrinkling&quot; – or rather, circling – technique to the car in the plane, though it is much more involved.

==Ways to prove the h-principle==
*Removal of Singularities technique developed by Gromov and Eliashberg
*Sheaf technique based on the work of Smale and Hirsch.
*Convex integration based on the work of Nash and Kuiper.

==Some paradoxes==

Here we list a few counter-intuitive results which can be proved by applying the 
h-principle:

*Cone eversion. Consider functions &quot;f&quot; on R2 without origin &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = |&quot;x&quot;|. Then there is a continuous one-parameter family of functions formula_28 such that formula_29, formula_30 and for any formula_31, formula_32 is not zero at any point.
*Any open manifold admits a (non-complete) Riemannian metric of positive (or negative) curvature.
*Sphere eversion without creasing or tearing can be done using formula_27 immersions of formula_34.
*The Nash-Kuiper C1 isometric embedding theorem, in particular implies that there is a formula_27 isometric immersion of the round formula_34 into an arbitrarily small ball of formula_37. This immersion cannot be formula_38 because a small oscillating sphere would provide a large lower bound for the principal curvatures, and therefore for the Gauss curvature of the immersed sphere, but on the other hand if the immersion is formula_38 this has to be equal to 1 everywhere, the Gauss curvature of the standard formula_34, by Gauss&#x27; Theorema Egregium.

<text>Stuart Henry McPhail Hall (3 February 1932 – 10 February 2014) was a Jamaican-born British Marxist sociologist, cultural theorist, and political activist. Hall – along with Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams – was one of the founding figures of the school of thought known as British Cultural Studies or the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies.

In the 1950s Hall was a founder of the influential journal &quot;New Left Review&quot;. At Hoggart&#x27;s invitation, he joined the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham in 1964. Hall took over from Hoggart as acting director of the CCCS in 1968, became its director in 1972, and remained there until 1979. While at the centre, Hall is credited with playing a role in expanding the scope of cultural studies to deal with race and gender, and with helping to incorporate new ideas derived from the work of French theorists such as Michel Foucault.

Hall left the centre in 1979 to become a professor of sociology at the Open University. He was President of the British Sociological Association from 1995 to 1997. He retired from the Open University in 1997 and was professor emeritus there until his death. British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; called him &quot;one of the country&#x27;s leading cultural theorists&quot;. Hall was also involved in the Black Arts Movement. Movie directors such as John Akomfrah and Isaac Julien also see him as one of their heroes.

Hall was married to Catherine Hall, a feminist professor of modern British history at University College London, with whom he had two children. After his death, Stuart Hall was described as &quot;one of the most influential intellectuals of the last sixty years&quot;. The Stuart Hall Foundation was established in 2015 by his family, friends and colleagues to &quot;work collaboratively to forge creative partnerships in the spirit of Stuart Hall; thinking together and working towards a racially just and more equal future.&quot;

==Biography==
Stuart Henry McPhail Hall was born on 3 February 1932 in Kingston, Colony of Jamaica, into a middle-class family. His parents were Herman McPhail Hall and Jessie Merle Hopwood. Herman&#x27;s direct ancestors were English, living in Jamaica for several centuries, tracing back to the Kingston tavern-keeper John Hall (1722–1797) and his Dutch wife Allegonda Boom. Hall&#x27;s direct paternal ancestors were implicated in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery in Jamaica, being associated with the Grecian Regale Plantation, Saint Andrew Parish. Hall&#x27;s mother was descended through her mother from John Rock Grosset, a local pro-slavery Tory member of Parliament. According to the &quot;1820 Jamaica Almanac&quot;, Stuart&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather John Herman Hall owned 20 enslaved Black African people. His ancestors were Portuguese, Jews, English, Africans and Indians.

As a teen he had been baptized in an Evangelical Youth Group. He attended the all-male Jamaica College, one of the island&#x27;s elite establishments, receiving an education modeled after the British school system. In an interview, Hall describes himself as a &quot;bright, promising scholar&quot; in these years and his formal education as &quot;a very &#x27;classical&#x27; education; very good but in very formal academic terms.&quot; With the help of sympathetic teachers, he expanded his education to include &quot;T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Freud, Marx, Lenin and some of the surrounding literature and modern poetry&quot;, as well as &quot;Caribbean literature&quot;. Hall&#x27;s later works reveal that growing up in the pigmentocracy of the colonial West Indies, where he was of darker skin than much of his family, had a profound effect on his views.

In 1951, Hall won a Rhodes Scholarship to Merton College at the University of Oxford, where he studied English and obtained a Master of Arts degree, becoming part of the Windrush generation, the first large-scale emigration of West Indians, as that community was then known. He originally intended to do graduate work on the medieval poem &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, reading it through the lens of contemporary literary criticism, but was dissuaded by his language professor, J. R. R. Tolkien, who told him &quot;in a pained tone that this was not the point of the exercise.&quot; Hall began a doctorate on Henry James at Oxford but, galvanised particularly by the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary (which saw many thousands of members leave the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) and look for alternatives to previous orthodoxies) and the Suez Crisis, abandoned this in 1957 or 1958 to focus on his political work. In 1957, he joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and it was on a CND march that he met his future wife. From 1958 to 1960, Hall worked as a teacher in a London secondary modern school and in adult education, and in 1964 married Catherine Hall, concluding around this time that he was unlikely to return permanently to the Caribbean.

After working on the &quot;Universities and Left Review&quot; during his time at Oxford, Hall joined E. P. Thompson, Raymond Williams and others to merge it with &quot;The New Reasoner&quot; journal, launching the &quot;New Left Review&quot; in 1960, with Hall as the founding editor. In 1958, the same group, with Raphael Samuel, launched the Partisan Coffee House in Soho as a meeting place for left-wingers. Hall left the board of the &quot;New Left Review&quot; in 1961 or 1962.

Hall&#x27;s academic career took off in 1964 after he co-wrote with Paddy Whannel of the British Film Institute &quot;one of the first books to make the case for the serious study of film as entertainment&quot;, &quot;The Popular Arts&quot;. As a direct result, Richard Hoggart invited Hall to join the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham, initially as a research fellow at Hoggart&#x27;s own expense. In 1968, Hall became director of the centre. He wrote a number of influential articles in the years that followed, including &quot;Situating Marx: Evaluations and Departures&quot; (1972) and &quot;Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Great Moving Right Show&quot; (for Marxism Today), in which he famously coined the term ‘&quot;Thatcherism&quot;’. He also contributed to the book &quot;Policing the Crisis&quot; (1978) and coedited the influential &quot;Resistance Through Rituals&quot; (1975).

Shortly before Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, Hall and Maggie Steed presented &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Racist Mum&quot;, an &quot;Open Door&quot; programme made by the Campaign Against Racism in the Media (CARM), which tackled racial stereotypes and contemporary British attitudes to immigration. After his appointment as a professor of sociology at the Open University (OU) that year, Hall published further influential books, including &quot;The Hard Road to Renewal&quot; (1988), &quot;Formations of Modernity&quot; (1992), &quot;Questions of Cultural Identity&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices&quot; (1997). Through the 1970s and 1980s, Hall was closely associated with the journal &quot;Marxism Today&quot;; in 1995, he was a founding editor of &quot;Soundings: A Journal of Politics and Culture&quot;.

He spoke internationally on Cultural Studies, including a series of lectures in 1983 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that were recorded and would decades later form the basis of the 2016 book &quot;Cultural Studies 1983: A Theoretical History&quot; (edited by Jennifer Slack and Lawrence Grossberg).

Hall was the founding chair of Iniva (Institute of International Visual Arts) and the photography organization Autograph ABP (the Association of Black Photographers).

Hall retired from the Open University in 1997. He was elected fellow of the British Academy in 2005 and received the European Cultural Foundation&#x27;s Princess Margriet Award in 2008. He died on 10 February 2014, from complications following kidney failure, a week after his 82nd birthday. By the time of his death, he was widely known as the &quot;godfather of multiculturalism&quot;. His memoir, &quot;Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands&quot; (co-authored with Bill Schwarz), was posthumously published in 2017, based on hours of interviews conducted with Hall over many years.

Hall was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, where in 2022 an audio artwork by Trevor Mathison explored his legacy. Entitled &quot;The Conversation Continues: We Are Still Listening&quot;, the 40-minute soundscape was &quot;a re-examination of the lives and histories of those laid to rest at Highgate Cemetery in the context of contemporary anti-racism movements.&quot;

==Ideas==
Hall&#x27;s work covers issues of hegemony and cultural studies, taking a post-Gramscian stance. He regards language-use as operating within a framework of power, institutions and politics/economics. This view presents people as &quot;producers&quot; and &quot;consumers&quot; of culture at the same time. (Hegemony, in Gramscian theory, refers to the socio-cultural production more of &quot;consent&quot; and &quot;coercion&quot;.) For Hall, culture was not something to simply appreciate or study, but a &quot;critical site of social action and intervention, where power relations are both established and potentially unsettled&quot;.

Hall became one of the main proponents of reception theory, and developed the theory of encoding and decoding. This approach to textual analysis focuses on the scope for negotiation and opposition on the part of the audience. This means that the audience does not simply passively accept a text—social control. Crime statistics, in Hall&#x27;s view, are often manipulated for political and economic purposes. Moral panics (e.g. over mugging) could thereby be ignited in order to create public support for the need to &quot;police the crisis&quot;. The media play a central role in the &quot;social production of news&quot; in order to reap the rewards of lurid crime stories.

In his 2006 essay &quot;Reconstruction Work: Images of Postwar Black Settlement&quot;, Hall also interrogates questions of historical memory and visuality in relation to photography as a colonial technology. According to Hall, understanding and writing about the history of black migration and settlement in Britain during the postwar era requires a careful and critical examination of the limited historical archive, and photographic evidence proves itself invaluable. However, photographic images are often perceived as more objective than other representations, which is dangerous. In his view, one must critically examine who produced these images, what purpose they serve, and how they further their agenda (e.g., what has been deliberately included and excluded in the frame). For example, in the context of postwar Britain, photographic images such as those displayed in the &quot;Picture Post&quot; article &quot;Thirty Thousand Colour Problems&quot; construct black migration, blackness in Britain, as &quot;the &quot;problem&quot;&quot;. They construct miscegenation as &quot;the centre of the problem&quot;, as &quot;the problem of the problem&quot;, as &quot;the core issue&quot;.

Hall&#x27;s political influence extended to the Labour Party, perhaps related to the influential articles he wrote for the CPGB&#x27;s theoretical journal &quot;Marxism Today&quot; (&quot;MT&quot;) that challenged the left&#x27;s views of markets and general organisational and political conservatism. This discourse had a profound impact on the Labour Party under both Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair, although Hall later decried New Labour as operating on &quot;terrain defined by Thatcherism&quot;.

===Encoding and decoding model===

Hall presented his encoding and decoding philosophy in various publications and at several oral events across his career. The first was in &quot;Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse&quot; (1973), a paper he wrote for the Council of Europe Colloquy on &quot;Training in the Critical Readings of Television Language&quot; organised by the Council and the Centre for Mass Communication Research at the University of Leicester. It was produced for students at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, which Paddy Scannell explains: &quot;largely accounts for the provisional feel of the text and its &#x27;incompleteness. In 1974 the paper was presented at a symposium on Broadcasters and the Audience in Venice. Hall also presented his encoding and decoding model in &quot;Encoding/Decoding&quot; in &quot;Culture, Media, Language&quot; in 1980. The time difference between Hall&#x27;s first publication on encoding and decoding in 1973 and his 1980 publication is highlighted by several critics. Of particular note is Hall&#x27;s transition from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies to the Open University.

Hall had a major influence on cultural studies, and many of the terms his texts set forth continue to be used in the field. His 1973 text is viewed as a turning point in Hall&#x27;s research toward structuralism and provides insight into some of the main theoretical developments he explored at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies.

Hall takes a semiotic approach and builds on the work of Roland Barthes and Umberto Eco. The essay takes up and challenges longheld assumptions about how media messages are produced, circulated and consumed, proposing a new theory of communication. &quot;The &#x27;object&#x27; of production practices and structures in television is the production of a &quot;message&quot;: that is, a sign-vehicle or rather sign-vehicles of a specific kind organized, like any other form of communication or language, through the operation of codes, within the syntagmatic chains of a discourse.&quot;

According to Hall, a message &quot;must be perceived as meaningful discourse and meaningfully de-coded&quot; before it has an &quot;effect&quot;, a &quot;use&quot;, or satisfies a &quot;need&quot;. There are four codes of the encoding/decoding model of communication. The first way of encoding is the dominant (i.e. hegemonic) code. This is the code the encoder expects the decoder to recognize and decode. &quot;When the viewer takes the connoted meaning ... full and straight ... and decodes the message in terms of the reference-code in which it has been coded, ... [it operates] inside the dominant code.&quot; The second way of encoding is the professional code. It operates in tandem with the dominant code. &quot;It serves to reproduce the dominant definitions precisely by bracketing the hegemonic quality, and operating with professional codings which relate to such questions as visual quality, news and presentational values, televisual quality, &#x27;professionalism&#x27; etc.&quot; The third way of encoding is the negotiated code. &quot;It acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations, while, at a more restricted, situational level, it makes its own ground-rules, it operates with &#x27;exceptions&#x27; to the rule.&quot; The fourth way of encoding is the oppositional code, also known as the globally contrary code. &quot;It is possible for a viewer perfectly to understand both the literal and connotative inflection given to an event, but to determine to decode the message in a globally contrary way.&quot; &quot;Before this message can have an &#x27;effect&#x27; (however defined), or satisfy a &#x27;need&#x27; or be put to a &#x27;use&#x27;, it must first be perceived as a meaningful discourse and meaningfully de-coded.&quot;

Hall challenged all four components of the mass communications model. He argues that (i) meaning is not simply fixed or determined by the sender; (ii) the message is never transparent; and (iii) the audience is not a passive recipient of meaning. For example, a documentary film on asylum seekers that aims to provide a sympathetic account of their plight does not guarantee that audiences will feel sympathetic. Despite being realistic and recounting facts, the documentary must still communicate through a sign system (the aural-visual signs of TV) that simultaneously distorts the producers&#x27; intentions and evokes contradictory feelings in the audience.

Distortion is built into the system, rather than being a &quot;failure&quot; of the producer or viewer. There is a &quot;lack of fit&quot;, Hall argues, &quot;between the two sides in the communicative exchange&quot;—that is, between the moment of the production of the message (&quot;encoding&quot;) and the moment of its reception (&quot;decoding&quot;).
In &quot;Encoding/decoding&quot;, Hall suggests media messages accrue common-sense status in part through their performative nature. Through the repeated performance, staging or telling of the narrative of &quot;9/11&quot; (as an example; there are others like it), a culturally specific interpretation becomes not only plausible and universal but elevated to &quot;common sense&quot;.

===Views on cultural identity and the African diaspora===

In his influential 1996 essay &quot;Cultural Identity and Diaspora&quot;, Hall presents two different definitions of cultural identity.

In the first definition, cultural identity is &quot;a sort of collective &#x27;one true self&#x27; ... which many people with a shared history and ancestry hold in common.&quot; In this view, cultural identity provides a &quot;stable, unchanging and continuous frame of reference and meaning&quot; through the ebb and flow of historical change. This allows the tracing back the origins of descendants and reflecting on the historical experiences of ancestors as a shared truth. Therefore, blacks living in the diaspora need only &quot;unearth&quot; their African past to discover their true cultural identity. While Hall appreciates the good effects this first view of cultural identity has had in the postcolonial world, he proposes a second definition of cultural identity that he views as superior.

Hall&#x27;s second definition of cultural identity &quot;recognises that, as well as the many points of similarity, there are also critical points of deep and significant &quot;difference&quot; which constitute &#x27;what we really are&#x27;; or rather – since history has intervened – &#x27;what we have become&#x27;.&quot; In this view, cultural identity is not a fixed essence rooted in the past. Instead, cultural identities &quot;undergo constant transformation&quot; throughout history as they are &quot;subject to the continuous &#x27;play&#x27; of history, culture, and power&quot;. Thus Hall defines cultural identities as &quot;the names we give to the different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselves within, the narratives of the past.&quot; This view of cultural identity was more challenging than the previous due to its dive into deep differences, but nonetheless it showed the mixture of the African diaspora. In other words, for Hall cultural identity is &quot;not an essence but a &quot;positioning&quot;&quot;.

====Presences====

Hall describes Caribbean identity in terms of three distinct &quot;presences&quot;: the African, the European, and the American. Taking the terms from Aimé Césaire and Léopold Senghor, he describes the three presences: &quot;Présence Africaine&quot;, &quot;Présence
Européenne&quot;, and &quot;Présence Americaine&quot;. &quot;Présence Africaine&quot; is the &quot;unspeakable &#x27;presence&#x27; in Caribbean culture&quot;. According to Hall, the African presence, though repressed by slavery and colonialism, is in fact hiding in plain sight in every aspect of Caribbean society and culture, including language, religion, the arts, and music. For many black people living in the diaspora, Africa becomes an &quot;imagined community&quot; to which they feel a sense of belonging.

However, Hall points out, there is no going back to the Africa that existed before slavery, because Africa too has changed. Secondly, Hall describes the European presence in Caribbean cultural identity as the legacy of colonialism, racism, power and exclusion. Unlike the &quot;Présence Africaine&quot;, the European presence is not unspoken even though many would like to be separated from the history of the oppressor. But Hall argues that Caribbeans and diasporic peoples must acknowledge how the European presence has also become an inextricable part of their own identities. Lastly, Hall describes the American presence as the &quot;ground, place, territory&quot; where people and cultures from around the world collided. It is, as Hall puts it, &quot;where the fateful/fatal encounter was staged between Africa and the West&quot;, and also where the displacement of the natives occurred.

====Diasporic identity====

Because diasporic cultural identity in the Caribbean and throughout the world is a mixture of all these different presences, Hall advocated a &quot;conception of &#x27;identity&#x27; that lives with and through, not despite, difference; by &quot;hybridity&quot;&quot;. According to Hall, black people living in diaspora are constantly reinventing themselves and their identities by mixing, hybridizing, and &quot;creolizing&quot; influences from Africa, Europe, and the rest of the world in their everyday lives and cultural practices. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all cultural identity for diasporic people, but rather a multiplicity of different cultural identities that share both important similarities and important differences, all of which should be respected.

====Difference and differance====

In &quot;Cultural Identity and Diaspora&quot;, Hall sheds light on the topic of difference within black identity. He first acknowledges the oneness in the black diaspora and how this unity is at the core of blackness and the black experience. He expresses how this has a unifying effect on the diaspora, giving way to movements such as negritude and the pan-African political project. Hall also acknowledges the deep-rooted &quot;difference&quot; within the diaspora as well. This difference was created by destructive nature of the transatlantic slave trade and the resulting generations of slavery. He describes this difference as what constitutes &quot;what we really are&quot;, or the true nature of the diaspora. The duality of such an identity, that expresses deep unity but clear uniqueness and internal distinctness provokes a question out of Hall: &quot;How, then, to describe this play of &#x27;difference&#x27; within identity?&quot; Hall&#x27;s answer is &quot;Différance&quot;. The use of the &quot;a&quot; in the word unsettles us from our initial and common interpretation of it, and was originally introduced by Jacques Derrida. This modification of the word difference conveys the separation between spatial and temporal difference, and more adequately encapsulates the nuances of the diaspora.

== Global policy ==
Hall was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Legacy==
* The Stuart Hall Library, Iniva&#x27;s specialist arts and culture reference library, currently located in Pimlico, London, and founded in 2007, is named after Stuart Hall, who was the chair of the board of Iniva for many years.
* In November 2014, a week-long celebration of Stuart Hall&#x27;s achievements was held at the University of London&#x27;s Goldsmiths College, where on 28 November the new Academic Building was renamed in his honour, as the Professor Stuart Hall building (PSH).
* The establishment of the Stuart Hall Foundation in his memory and to continue his life&#x27;s work was announced in December 2014. The Foundation is &quot;committed to public education, addressing urgent questions of race and inequality in culture and society through talks and events, and building a growing network of Stuart Hall Foundation scholars and artists in residence.&quot;
*In May 2016, Housmans bookshop sold Hall&#x27;s private library. 3,000 books were donated to Housmans by Hall&#x27;s widow Catherine Hall.
*Artist Claudette Johnson completed a portrait of Hall in 2023. Commissioned by Merton College, the portrait hangs in the Hall at Merton alongside other Fellows and Wardens.

===Film===
Hall was a presenter of a seven-part television series entitled &quot;Redemption Song&quot; — made by Barraclough Carey Productions, and transmitted on BBC2, between 30 June and 12 August 1991 — in which he examined the elements that make up the Caribbean, looking at the turbulent history of the islands and interviewing people who live there today. The series episodes were as follows:
* &quot;Shades of Freedom&quot; (11/08/1991)
* &quot;Following Fidel&quot; (04/08/1991)
* &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; (28 July 1991)
* &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (21 July 1991)
* &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (14 July 1991)
* &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (7 July 1991)
* &quot;Iron in the Soul&quot; (30 June 1991)

Hall&#x27;s lectures have been turned into several videos distributed by the Media Education Foundation:
* &quot;Race, the Floating Signifier&quot; (1997).
* &quot;Representation &amp; the Media&quot; (1997).
* &quot;The Origins of Cultural Studies&quot; (2006).

Mike Dibb produced a film based on a long interview between journalist Maya Jaggi and Stuart Hall called &quot;Personally Speaking&quot; (2009).

Hall is the subject of two films directed by John Akomfrah, entitled &quot;The Unfinished Conversation&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Stuart Hall Project&quot; (2013). The first film was shown (26 October 2013 – 23 March 2014) at Tate Britain, Millbank, London, while the second is now available on DVD.

&quot;The Stuart Hall Project&quot; was composed of clips drawn from more than 100 hours of archival footage of Hall, woven together over the music of jazz artist Miles Davis, who was an inspiration to both Hall and Akomfrah.

The film&#x27;s structure is composed of multiple strands. There is a chronological grounding in historical events, such as the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, along with reflections by Hall on his experiences as an immigrant from the Caribbean to Britain. Another historical event vital to the film was the 1958 Notting Hill race riots occasioned by attacks on black people in the area; these protests showed the presence of a black community within England. When discussing the Caribbean, Hall discusses the idea of hybridity and he states that the Caribbean is the home of hybridity. There are also voiceovers and interviews offered without a specific temporal grounding in the film that nonetheless give the viewer greater insights into Hall and his philosophy. Along with the voiceovers and interviews, embedded in the film are also Hall&#x27;s personal achievements; this is extremely rare, as there are no traditional archives of those Caribbean peoples moulded by the Middle Passage experience.

The film can be viewed as a more pointedly focused take on the Windrush generation, those who migrated from the Caribbean to Britain in the years immediately following the World War II. Hall, himself a member of this generation, focused on the racial discrimination faced by the Windrush generation, contrasting the idealized perceptions among West Indian immigrants of Britain versus the harsher reality they encountered when arriving in the &quot;mother country&quot;.

A central theme in the film is diasporic belonging. Hall confronted his own identity within both British and Caribbean communities, and at one point in the film he remarks: &quot;Britain is my home, but I am not English.&quot;

IMDb summarises the film as &quot;a roller coaster ride through the upheavals, struggles and turning points that made the 20th century the century of campaigning, and of global political and cultural change.&quot;

In August 2012, Professor Sut Jhally conducted an interview with Hall that touched on a number of themes and issues in cultural studies.

<doc id="481123" wikidata="Q4945919" url="?curid=481123" title="Born on a Pirate Ship">
<text>Born on a Pirate Ship is the third full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies (BNL), featuring the songs &quot;Shoe Box&quot;, &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;When I Fall&quot; and &quot;Break Your Heart&quot;. &quot;The Old Apartment&quot; would become BNL&#x27;s first US hit in 1997.

&quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; was recorded as a four-piece quartet, following the departure of keyboardist Andy Creeggan. Kevin Hearn is not credited on the album, but joined the group for the 1995 tour preceding the album&#x27;s release in time to be thanked in the liner notes for &quot;injecting new spirit.&quot;

Steven Page and Ed Robertson returned to writing together, as they did upon the band&#x27;s formation, but had abandoned following the release of &quot;Gordon&quot;.

The album is also an enhanced CD. The data track contains audio samples from the band&#x27;s previous two CDs, a short montage of press photos, several of the band&#x27;s music videos, a short trivia quiz, and a pair of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; videos from the band. Similar content was included and expanded upon on the &quot;Shoe Box E.P.&quot;; however, the format of the enhanced CD used in the creation of that CD renders the data track inaccessible on modern operating systems.

Although a moderate hit in Canada reaching No. 12, the album managed No. 111 in the US. &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; was awarded gold status in the U.S. in 2000.

The title and front cover photo refers to a vulgar joke that was popular around the time the band members were children. One kid would instruct another to pull back the corners of their mouth with their fingers (but not stick their tongue out) and say, &quot;I was born on a pirate ship.&quot; The result would sound like them saying, &quot;I was born on a pile o&#x27; shit.&quot; Sometimes &quot;with a bunch of apples&quot; would be added at the end, which would come out as &quot;with a bunch of assholes.&quot;

<text>Baron Macdonald, of Slate in the County of Antrim, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1776 for Sir Alexander Macdonald, 9th Baronet, of Sleat. The Macdonald family of Sleat descends from Uisdean Macdonald (died 1498), also known as Hugh of Sleat, or Hugh Macdonald, who was an illegitimate son of Alexander Macdonald, Earl of Ross. On 28 May 1625, his great-great-great-great-grandson Donald Gorm Og Macdonald (not to be confused with Donald Gorm, Hugh&#x27;s great grandson) was created a baronet, of Sleat in the Isle of Skye in the County of Inverness, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The baronetcy was created with remainder to heirs male whatsoever and with a special clause of precedence which provided that it should have precedency over all former baronets (Sir Robert Gordon excepted).

On 23 December 1716 the fourth baronet, Sir Donald MacDonald, was created Lord Sleat in the Jacobite peerage.

The first baronet&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson, the ninth Baronet, was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Macdonald, of Slate in the County of Antrim, in 1776. Lord Macdonald married Elizabeth Diana Bosville, daughter of Godfrey Bosville. Their eldest son, the second Baron, represented Saltash in Parliament. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. In 1814 Lord Macdonald inherited the Bosville estates of Thorpe and Gunthwaite in Yorkshire through his mother, and assumed by Royal licence the surname of Bosville in lieu of Macdonald the same year. However, on inheriting the Macdonald estates on the death of his older brother in 1824 he resumed by Royal licence the surname of Macdonald after that of Bosville. In 1803 Lord Macdonald married, in an English ceremony, Louisa Maria la Coast, illegitimate daughter of Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (grandson of King George II). The couple had previously married in a Scottish ceremony in 1799. However, the validity of the Scottish marriage was disputed, and as a result the eldest son of Lord Macdonald born before his 1803 marriage, Alexander William Robert Bosville, was not allowed to succeed his father in the titles (this decision was later challenged; see below). He was therefore succeeded by his eldest son born after the 1803 marriage, the fourth Baron. His great-grandson, the seventh Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Inverness from 1952 to 1970. the barony is held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the eighth Baron. He is Chief of the Name and Arms of Macdonald (see Clan Donald).

The family seat is Kinloch Lodge, near Sleat, Isle of Skye.

According to a decision by the Court of Session in June 1910, the children born before the 1803 marriage of the third Baron Macdonald were legitimate according to Scottish Law. However, this decision was only valid regarding the Nova Scotia baronetcy and not the Irish barony. As a result, the third Baron&#x27;s rightful successor in the Baronetcy was his eldest son Alexander William Robert Bosville (the de jure twelfth Baronet). He had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Bosville in 1832 and had in 1847 inherited his father&#x27;s Bosville estates in Yorkshire by Act of Parliament. His grandson, the de jure fourteenth Baronet, was recognised in the Baronetcy according to the aforementioned 1910 decision by the Court of Session. the baronetcy is held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the seventeenth Baronet.

The family seat is Thorpe Hall, near Rudston, Yorkshire.

<doc id="481128" wikidata="Q497030" url="?curid=481128" title="Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty">
<text>The Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty, sometimes called sillok () for short, are state-compiled and published records, called Veritable Records, documenting the reigns of the kings of the Joseon dynasty in Korea. Kept from 1392 to 1865, they comprise 1,893 volumes and are thought to be the longest continual documentation of a single dynasty in the world.

The records of the last two monarchs are believed to have been influenced by the Japanese colonial rule and, therefore, their credibility compromised. Excluding the records of the last two kings, the &quot;sillok&quot; is designated as the 151st national treasure of South Korea and listed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World registry.

In 2006, the annals were digitized and made available online by the National Institute of Korean History. Both a modern-Korean translation in hangul and the original in Classical Chinese are available. In January 2012, the National Institute of Korean History announced a plan to translate them to English by 2033. The work was scheduled to start in 2014 with an initial budget of ₩500 million, but it was estimated that a total of ₩40 billion would be needed to complete the project.

==Compilation process==
The Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;ugwan, overseen by the three High State Councillors, served as the state archive for administrative records. However, the eight historians of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ranks in the Office of Royal Decrees () were responsible for maintaining daily records of official court activities. These historians accompanied the king at all times, and Joseon kings did not conduct official business without a historian present. The daily historical records produced by the eight historians were called &quot;sacho&quot; (), which served as the basis for the compilation.

After the death of a king, the veritable records, or &quot;sillok&quot;, of the deceased monarch&#x27;s reign were compiled by a special committee known as the Sillokcheong, or the Office of Annals Compilation. This committee included high-ranking officials and the most competent scholars. The compilation relied on various primary sources, including the &quot;sacho&quot;, historians&#x27; private memoranda, administrative records (), and the &quot;Seungjeongwon ilgi&quot;.

The compilation process consisted roughly of three phases. First, the primary sources were gathered, and the historians produced the first draft (). This draft was then refined into a second draft (), which was reviewed and finalized by high-ranking officials into a final draft (). Once finalized, the drafts, &quot;sacho&quot;, and the historians&#x27; private memoranda were pulped in water and expunged () to prevent leaks.

Great care was taken to ensure the integrity of the records; historians were guaranteed legal protection and editorial independence, especially from the king. Only the historians were allowed to read the &quot;sacho&quot;; if any historian disclosed or altered its contents, they were subject to severe punishment. Pulping and expunging the drafts and certain primary sources likely to contain historian commentary was a safety measure designed to insulate the historians from political influences and preserve the integrity of the records.

An oft-cited story in the &quot;sillok&quot; about King Taejong falling off his horse has been used to illustrate the commitment of Joseon court historians to documenting even events displeasing or embarrassing to the king and the extent to which the king could not influence which stories were included in the &quot;sillok&quot;.

The historian present defied King Taejong&#x27;s order and ensured that not only the king’s fall but also his wish to keep it off the record were documented.

The records are written in Classical Chinese. The records of the first three kings of the Joseon dynasty—Taejo (), Jeongjong (), and Taejong ()—were handwritten. The records of Sejong () and later kings were printed using movable type, some wooden and others metal. Korea is the first nation in East Asia to have printed its royal records using movable type.

== History ==
Beginning in 1445, they began creating three additional copies of the records, which they distributed at various locations around Korea for safekeeping: the Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;ugwan office in Seoul, Chungju County, Jeonju County, and Seongju County. Despite this precaution, during the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions of Korea, all repositories were destroyed, except for the one in Jeonju. The Jeonju records narrowly escaped being destroyed by fire and were only saved by the private initiative of several scholars. After the war, the government began maintaining five repositories at Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;ugwan, Mount Myohyang, Taebaeksan, Odaesan, and Manisan.

The 1624 Yi Gwal&#x27;s Rebellion resulted in the destruction of the Ch&#x27;unch&#x27;ugwan repository. It was not replaced; they ultimately returned to printing four copies of the records and storing them at the other repositories. The Mount Myohyang copy was moved to Jeoksangsan in 1633. Part of the Manisan collection was lost during the 1636 Qing invasion of Joseon, and the surviving volumes moved to Jeongjok-san on Ganghwa Island in 1678.

During the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, the records went under the control of the Japanese colonial government. The Jeongjoksan and Taebaeksan repositories were transferred to the holdings of Keijō Imperial University in Seoul. The Odae-san copies were taken to Tokyo Imperial University in Japan. There, they were mostly destroyed during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. The remaining 46 volumes in Japan were not returned to Korea until 2006.

The annals of the last two Joseon rulers, and , are controversial and considered by modern South Korean historians to lack the impartiality of the other sources. This is because Japanese officials interfered in their creation and curation. They are thus considered relatively separate from the other records, and are not included in the National Treasures of South Korea or UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World register.

Around the liberation of Korea, the Jeoksangsan copies were partially looted during the instability; there are reportedly uncertain rumors that some of these copies were actually taken during the 1950–1953 Korean War to North Korea. The Jeongjoksan and Taebaeksan records were still held in the collection Kyujanggak, at Seoul National University (the successor to Keijō Imperial University). In the 1980s, the Taebaeksan copies were moved to the National Archives of Korea, Busan Center.

 During the 1918–1920 Independence War, Latvia was contested by two other governments: the government of Soviet Latvia, led by Pēteris Stučka, and the government of Andrievs Niedra, backed by Baltic Germans. Some sources may list Stučka and Niedra as prime ministers for periods when their governments controlled most of Latvia.

 On 15 May 1934, prime minister Ulmanis dissolved parliament and banned all political parties (including his own &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Union&quot;), establishing authoritarian rule.

 Puppet leader appointed by Soviet authorities. Not recognized as such by the Latvian government.

<text>The Union, colloquially known as the North, refers to the United States when eleven Southern slave states seceded to form the Confederate States of America (CSA), also known as the Confederacy or South, during the American Civil War. The Union was led by Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, and sought to preserve the nation, a constitutional federal union.

In the context of the Civil War, &quot;Union&quot; is also often used as a synonym for &quot;the northern states loyal to the United States government&quot;. In this meaning, the Union included 20 free states (in the north and west) and four southern border slave states, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, though Missouri and Kentucky both had dual competing Confederate and Unionist governments.

The Union Army was a new formation comprising mostly state units, together with units from the regular U.S. Army. Keeping the southern border states in the Union was considered essential to its winning the war.

The Northeast and Midwest provided the industrial resources for a mechanized war producing large quantities of munitions and supplies and financing the war. They provided soldiers, food, horses, financial support, and training camps. Army hospitals were also set up across the Union. Most Northern states had Republican governors who energetically supported the war effort and suppressed anti-war subversion, particularly that that arose in 1863–64. The Democratic Party strongly supported the war at the beginning in 1861, but by 1862, was split between the War Democrats and the anti-war element known as Peace Democrats, led by the extremist &quot;Copperheads&quot;. The Democrats made major electoral gains in 1862 in state elections, most notably in New York. They lost ground in 1863, especially in Ohio. In 1864, the Republicans and War Democrats joined to campaign under the National Union Party banner, which also attracted most soldiers, and scored a landslide victory for Lincoln and his entire ticket against Democratic candidate George B. McClellan.

The war years were quite prosperous except where serious fighting and guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside. Almost all military actions took place in the South. Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers&#x27; wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially in parts of New York City, with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the Coal Region of Northeastern Pennsylvania.

==Etymology==

In the context of the American Civil War, the Union, or the United States, is sometimes referred to as &quot;the North&quot;, both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was often called &quot;the South&quot;. The Union (the United States) never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy&#x27;s secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States. In foreign affairs, the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term &quot;Union&quot; occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The subsequent Constitution of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of &quot;We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union...&quot; &quot;Union&quot;, for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the Admission to the Union clause in Article IV, Section 3.

Even before the Civil War began the phrase &quot;preserve the Union&quot; was commonplace, and a &quot;union of states&quot; had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term &quot;Union&quot; to apply to the non-secessionist side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity. Before the American Civil War, the United States was known as the &quot;United States&#x27; federal union&quot;, a union of states controlled by the federal government in Washington, D.C. This was opposite to the CSA&#x27;s first government, a confederation of independent states, functioning similarly to the European Union. Confederates generally saw the Union as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, in reference to the U.S. Navy as the &quot;abolition fleet&quot; and the U.S. Army as &quot;abolition forces&quot;.

In 2015, historian Michael Landis called for an end to the use of the term &quot;Union&quot;, writing &quot;The employment of &#x27;Union&#x27; instead of &#x27;United States,&#x27; implicitly supports the Lost Cause, Confederate view of secession wherein the nation of the United States collapsed... In reality, however, the United States never ceased to exist... The dichotomy of &#x27;Union v. Confederacy&#x27; lends credibility to the Confederate experiment and undermines the legitimacy of the United States as a political entity.&quot; In 2021, the Army University Press noted that it was replacing usages of the word &quot;Union&quot; with &quot;Federal Government&quot; or &quot;U.S. Government&quot;. The Army University Press stated this was &quot;more historically accurate&quot; as &quot;the term &#x27;Union&#x27; always referred to all the states together.&quot;

==Size and strength==
Unlike the Confederacy, the loyal areas of the United States had a relatively large industrialized and urbanized area in the Northeast, and more advanced commercial, transportation and financial systems than the rural slaveholding South. Additionally, the Union states had a manpower advantage of five to two at the start of the war.

Year by year, the rebel Confederacy shrank and lost control of increasing quantities of resources and population. Meanwhile, the United States turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the US strength had to be used to garrison former-Confederate areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The loyal states&#x27; great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the rebel Confederacy, but it took a long time for the Union to fully mobilize these resources.
==Public opinion==

The attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian Allan Nevins writes:
 McClintock states:
Historian Michael Smith argues that as the war ground on year after year, the spirit of American republicanism grew stronger and generated fears of corruption in high places. Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.

Republicans responded with charges of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate prisoners of war and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slave owners, as the guilty party in the war.

==President Lincoln==
Historians have overwhelmingly praised the &quot;political genius&quot; of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s performance as president. His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln&#x27;s charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond, the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis&#x27;s, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.

==Congress==

The Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation&#x27;s economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the Morrill tariff, the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and the National Banking Act. Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as Thaddeus Stevens (on taxation and spending), Charles Sumner (on foreign affairs), Lyman Trumbull (on legal issues), Justin Smith Morrill (on land grants and tariffs) and William Pitt Fessenden (on finances).

Military and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the Radical Republicans, led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln&#x27;s role as commander-in-chief through the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy&#x27;s alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.

===Opposition===
The opposition came from Copperhead Democrats, who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by August Belmont. The Democratic Party was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate Horatio Seymour as governor of New York. They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives, including the Speaker of the House&#x27;s seat but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.
The 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought. Though the Democrats gained control of the legislature, they were unable to impede the war effort. Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton was able to maintain control of the state&#x27;s contribution to the war effort despite the Democratic majority. Washington was especially helpful in 1864 in arranging furloughs to allow Hoosier soldiers to return home so they could vote in elections. Across the North in 1864, the great majority of soldiers voted Republican. Men who had been Democrats before the war often abstained or voted Republican.

As the federal draft laws tightened, there was serious unrest among Copperhead strongholds, such as the Irish in the Pennsylvania coal mining districts. The government needed the coal more than the draftees, so it ignored the largely non-violent draft dodging there. The violent New York City draft riots of 1863 were suppressed by the U.S. Army firing grape shot down cobblestone city streets.

The Democrats nominated George McClellan, a War Democrat for the 1864 presidential but imposed an anti-war platform on him. In terms of Congress the opposition against the war was nearly powerless—as was the case in most states. In Indiana and Illinois pro-war governors circumvented anti-war legislatures elected in 1862. For 30 years after the war the Democrats carried the burden of having opposed the martyred Lincoln, who was viewed by many as the salvation of the Union and the destroyer of slavery.

===Copperheads===
The Copperheads were a large faction of northern Democrats who opposed the war, demanding an immediate peace settlement. They said they wanted to restore &quot;the Union as it was&quot; (that is, with the South and with slavery) but they realized that the Confederacy would never voluntarily rejoin the U.S. The most prominent Copperhead was Ohio&#x27;s Clement L. Vallandigham, a Congressman and leader of the Democratic Party in Ohio. He was defeated in an intense election for governor in 1863. Republican prosecutors in the Midwest accused some Copperhead activists of treason in a series of trials in 1864.

Copperheadism was a grassroots movement, strongest in the area just north of the Ohio River, as well as some urban ethnic wards. Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party. It looked back to Jacksonian Democracy for inspiration—with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies. However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons. Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election—its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.

==Soldiers==
===Recruiting volunteers===

Enthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it had only 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of Simon Cameron, also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.

Pennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: &quot;A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.&quot;

By the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.

The new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.

In the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of &quot;shoddy&quot; material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniforms—in blue—were standard. The nation&#x27;s factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.

While business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.

The calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the Emancipation Proclamation taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.
Michigan was especially eager to send thousands of volunteers. A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting, and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. Copperhead Democrats called the war a failure, and it became an increasingly partisan Republican effort. Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.

====Motivations of soldiers====

Perman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer, and die over four years:
====The paperwork war====

On the whole, the national, state, and local governments handled the avalanche of paperwork effectively. Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, John Shaw Billings, later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using punch cards. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861–64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792–1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816–1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828–1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.

===Medical conditions===


More soldiers died of disease than from battle injuries, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease, and accidents. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.

The hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll. This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department, and the United States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency. Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the United States Christian Commission, as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women&#x27;s Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by Henry Whitney Bellows, a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer Dorothea Dix. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet Walt Whitman. Frederick Law Olmsted, a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.

States could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor David Tod, a War Democrat who won office on a coalition &quot;Union Party&quot; ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the battle of Shiloh in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.

The Christian Commission comprised 6,000 volunteers who aided chaplains in many ways. For example, its agents distributed Bibles, delivered sermons, helped with sending letters home, taught men to read and write, and set up camp libraries.

The Army learned many lessons and modernized its procedures, and medical science—especially surgery—made many advances. In the long run, the wartime experiences of the numerous Union commissions modernized public welfare, and set the stage for large—scale community philanthropy in America based on fund raising campaigns and private donations.

Additionally, women gained new public roles. For example, Mary Livermore (1820–1905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for women&#x27;s suffrage after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.

The Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns. The pioneer was John Shaw Billings (1838–1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world&#x27;s most important libraries, Library of the Surgeon General&#x27;s Office (now the National Library of Medicine) and the New York Public Library; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card, later developed by his student Herman Hollerith. Hollerith&#x27;s company became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.

===Prisoners of war===
Both sides operated prison camps; they handled about 400,000 captives, but many other prisoners were quickly released and never sent to camps. The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861–63 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.

===Draft riots===
Discontent with the 1863 draft law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the New York City draft riots of July 13 to July 16, 1863. Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.

Small-scale riots broke out in ethnic German and Irish districts, and in areas along the Ohio River with many Copperheads. Holmes County, Ohio was an isolated parochial area dominated by Pennsylvania Dutch and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.

==Economy==

The Union economy grew and prospered during the war while fielding a very large army and navy. The Republicans in Washington had a Whiggish vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, all national banks, all knit together by a modern railroad system, to be mobilized by the United States Military Railroad. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.

===Financing the war===

In 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff. Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P. Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy. Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast l, the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall, the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.

The United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War—over $400 million just in 1862 alone.
Apart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from new excise taxes—a sort of value added tax—that was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws. Third came the nation&#x27;s first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war&#x27;s end.
Apart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time, bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker Jay Cooke. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the &quot;First National Bank&quot;. Third, the government printed paper money called &quot;greenbacks&quot;. They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.

The North&#x27;s most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.

====Tariffs====

Secretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10 points in order to generate more revenues. These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war&#x27;s needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill&#x27;s drafting. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.

Customs revenue from tariffs totaled $345 million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.

===Land grants===

The U.S. government owned vast amounts of fertile land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.

The 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established Department of Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the war. Prices were high, pulled up by a strong demand from the army and from Britain (which depended on American wheat for a fourth of its food imports). The war acted as a catalyst that encouraged the rapid adoption of horse-drawn machinery and other implements. The rapid spread of recent inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient, even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army. Many wives took their place and often consulted by mail on what to do; increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and help.

The Union used hundreds of thousands of animals. The Army had plenty of cash to purchase them from farmers and breeders but especially in the early months the quality was mixed. Horses were needed for cavalry and artillery. Mules pulled the wagons. The supply held up, despite an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians. In the South, the Union army shot all the horses it did not need to keep them out of Confederate hands.

===Cotton trade===

The Treasury started buying cotton during the war, for shipment to Europe and northern mills. The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and expelled them from his lines in 1862 but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.

==Society==
===Religion===

The Protestant religion was quite strong in the North in the 1860s. The United States Christian Commission sent agents into the Army camps to provide psychological support as well as books, newspapers, food and clothing. Through prayer, sermons and welfare operations, the agents ministered to soldiers&#x27; spiritual as well as temporal needs as they sought to bring the men to a Christian way of life. Most churches made an effort to support their soldiers in the field and especially their families back home. Much of the political rhetoric of the era had a distinct religious tone.

The Protestant clergy in America took a variety of positions. In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.

====Methodists====

Many Northerners had only recently become religious (following the Second Great Awakening) and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Carwardine argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power&#x27;s evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union. Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. Dissident Methodists left the church. During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church.

The Methodist family magazine &quot;Ladies&#x27; Repository&quot; promoted Christian family activism. Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.

===Family===

Historian Stephen M. Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier&#x27;s career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.

====Children====

There were numerous children&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;Merry&#x27;s Museum&quot;, &quot;The Student and Schoolmate&quot;, &quot;Our Young Folks&quot;, &quot;The Little Pilgrim&quot;, &quot;Forrester&#x27;s Playmate&quot; and &quot;The Little Corporal&quot;. They showed a Protestant religious tone and &quot;promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction&quot;. Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for &quot;declamation&quot;, short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members. By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling &quot;The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion&quot; that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.

Caring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government. A typical state was Iowa, where the private &quot;Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association&quot; operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls. The state government funded pensions for the widows and children of soldiers. Orphan schools like the Pennsylvania Soldiers&#x27; Orphan School, also spoke of the broader public welfare experiment that began as part of the aftermath of the Civil War. These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.

All the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves. Thousands of black refugees poured into St. Louis, where the Freedmen&#x27;s Relief Society, the Ladies Union Aid Society, the Western Sanitary Commission, and the American Missionary Association (AMA) set up schools for their children.

==Unionists in Southern and Border states==

People loyal to the U.S. federal government and opposed to secession living in the border states (where slavery was legal) and states under Confederate control, were termed Unionists. Confederates sometimes styled them &quot;Homemade Yankees&quot;. However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was formed. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy fully, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors Andrew Johnson and William G. Brownlow. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding. In western Virginia the counties that bordered Ohio and Pennsylvania were Unionist strongholds, though the interior counties supported Richmond and the Confederacy. With the aid of the Union army, and support in Congress, a Unionist government in Wheeling was able to create a new state, West Virginia, in 1863. The new state government however had control of no more than half its territory. The Union army remained in West Virginia until 1869, dealing with unrest and resistance to the new state.

Nearly 100,000 Unionists from the South served in the Union Army during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except for South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman&#x27;s personal escort on his march to the sea. Southern Unionists were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces. During the Reconstruction era (1865–1877), many Southern Unionists became &quot;Scalawags&quot;, a derogatory term for white Southern supporters of the Republican Party.

===Guerrilla warfare===

Besides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by guerrilla warfare. In states bitterly divided, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.

====Missouri====


Missouri was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands. Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders and the men of Bloody Bill Anderson terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued General Order No. 11 in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war. Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations—future U.S. President Harry Truman&#x27;s grandparents were caught up in the raids, and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.

Some marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla Jesse James was killed in Saint Joseph, Missouri. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the Bald Knobbers were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.

====Kentucky====
In response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with martial law authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the &quot;Butcher of Kentucky&quot;.

†Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state. Kentucky&#x27;s and Missouri&#x27;s Confederate governments never had significant control after 1862, though the Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri early in the war.

West Virginia separated from Virginia and became part of the Union during the war, on June 20, 1863. Nevada also joined the Union during the war, becoming a state on October 31, 1864.

===Union territories===

The Union-controlled territories in April 1861 were:
* Colorado Territory
* Dakota Territory
* Indian Territory (disputed with the Confederacy)
* Nebraska Territory
* Nevada Territory (became a state in 1864)
* New Mexico Territory
** Arizona Territory (split off in 1863)
* Utah Territory
* Washington Territory
** Idaho Territory (split off in 1863)
*** Montana Territory (split off in 1864)

The Indian Territory saw its own civil war, as the major tribes held slaves and endorsed the Confederacy.

<doc id="481135" wikidata="Q7354684" url="?curid=481135" title="Rock Spectacle">
<text>Rock Spectacle is the first live album by Barenaked Ladies. It was also the first major success for the band in the United States, selling over one million copies and producing a hit single in the country in its version of &quot;Brian Wilson.&quot; The album was recorded at two concerts: at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago and at The Olympia in Montreal during the &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship tour&quot;.

A live version of &quot;Shoe Box&quot; was on promotional and advance copies of this record, but was ultimately deleted. The recording would eventually be released on the &quot;One Week&quot; CD single. The album contains two bonus tracks. The first is a banter about an elderly woman Ed Robertson ran into in Chicago. The story is later referenced in &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot;. The second is improvised banter about Robertson&#x27;s Uncle Elwyn.

This disc is an enhanced CD, which means it will display special multimedia features when played on a computer. It includes a program called &quot;BNLTV&quot;, a faux collection of various-themed TV programming.

==Commercial performance==
By July 1998, &quot;Rock Spectacle&quot; had sold 775,000 copies in the United States and 80,000 copies in Canada. In September 1998, the album was certified Platinum in the United States.

<doc id="481143" wikidata="Q4862611" url="?curid=481143" title="Baron Massy">
<text>Baron Massy, of Duntryleague in the County of Limerick, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 4 August 1776 for Hugh Massy, who had previously represented County Limerick in the Irish House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, also represented this constituency in the Irish Parliament. His great-grandson, the sixth Baron, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1876 to 1915. He left such heavy debts that in 1924 the family were evicted from their home.

 the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the tenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1995.

Eyre Massey, 1st Baron Clarina, was the younger brother of the first Baron Massy.

The family seat was Killakee House, near Rathfarnham, County Dublin. The house was demolished in 1941, but the Killakee estate, popularly known as Lord Massey&#x27;s Wood, is now a much valued public amenity. Another seat from the 1790s was Hermitage House in Castleconnell, County Limerick, until it was burnt in June 1920, being demolished in the 1970s.

==Barons Massy (1776)==
*Hugh Massy, 1st Baron Massy (1700–1788)
*Hugh Massy, 2nd Baron Massy (1733–1790)
*Hugh Massy, 3rd Baron Massy (1761–1812)
*Hugh Hamon Massy, 4th Baron Massy (1793–1836)
*Hugh Hamon Ingoldsby Massy, 5th Baron Massy (1827–1874)
*John Thomas William Massy, 6th Baron Massy (1835–1915)
*Hugh Somerset John Massy, 7th Baron Massy (1864–1926)
*Hugh Hamon Charles George Massy, 8th Baron Massy (1894–1958)
*Hugh Hamon John Somerset Massy, 9th Baron Massy (1921–1995)
*David Harmon Somerset Massy, 10th Baron Massy (born 1947)

The heir presumptive is the present holder&#x27;s brother Hon. John Hugh Somerset Massy (born 1950). His heir apparent is his son Luke John Somerset Massy (born 1984).

<doc id="481155" wikidata="Q15222840" url="?curid=481155" title="Stunt (album)">
<text>Stunt is the fourth full-length studio album by Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies. Their most successful album, it entered the US charts at No. 3 and sold over 4 million units by the end of its chart run. Its first single, &quot;One Week&quot; became the band&#x27;s breakthrough single in the US market by hitting No. 1 (selling over 5 million copies). The song also reached No. 5 in the UK, and helped revitalize their career in the band&#x27;s home country of Canada, where their fame had diminished since the days of their debut album &quot;Gordon&quot;. In addition, follow-up singles &quot;It&#x27;s All Been Done&quot;, &quot;Alcohol&quot; and &quot;Call and Answer&quot; were each successful to some degree.

&quot;Stunt&quot; is the first studio album to feature keyboardist/guitarist Kevin Hearn, who originally joined the band for the &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; tour in 1995. Shortly after the release of the album, Hearn was diagnosed with leukemia. He spent the &quot;Stunt&quot; tour receiving chemotherapy and was replaced by Chris Brown and Greg Kurstin in the interim.

==Special edition and reissues==
There was also a special edition of the album which contained the standard 13 tracks plus a second disc including two versions of &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; (the album version and the &quot;2000&quot; version), and live versions of &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;When I Fall&quot;, &quot;If I Had $1000000&quot; and &quot;Straw Hat and Old Dirty Hank&quot;.

The album was released on vinyl June 2, 2015.

In 2018, Rhino Records announced a 20th Anniversary Edition to be released digitally on July 6, 2018, as well as physical copies on September 28, 2018. However, the date was pushed back to October 19, 2018. The physical forms come in a vinyl and a CD/DVD set. The DVD is the documentary for &quot;Barenaked In America&quot;, which was never previously released in North America. The album also contains the bonus tracks &quot;She&#x27;s On Time&quot; and &quot;Long Way Back Home&quot;. The CD version also adds &quot;Get In Line&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

<doc id="481156" wikidata="Q4272085" url="?curid=481156" title="Westchester, Los Angeles">
<text>Westchester is a neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles and the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, California, United States.

It is home to Los Angeles International Airport, Loyola Marymount University, Otis College of Art and Design, and Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnet Schools (formerly Westchester High School).

==Geography==

The main part of Westchester is bordered by Playa Vista and Culver City on the north, Inglewood and Lennox on the east, Hawthorne on the southeast, Del Aire and El Segundo on the south and Playa del Rey on the west. It includes all of the Los Angeles International Airport. There is also a two-block-wide shoestring district that runs from the intersection of Centinela Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard north to 63rd Street and then east to Overhill Avenue, where it links with the Hyde Park neighborhood.

The main neighborhood&#x27;s boundary lines are, generally, on the east: north-south on La Cienega Boulevard or the Inglewood city line; on the south: east-west on the city boundary with El Segundo or Imperial Highway; on the west: north-south on Pershing Drive and Westchester Parkway, then roughly north-south on a series of residential streets west of Westchester High School to the Playa Vista neighborhood.

==History==
Westchester began the 20th century as an agricultural area, growing a wide variety of crops in the dry, farming-friendly climate. The rapid development of the aerospace industry near Mines Field (as the Los Angeles Airport was then known), the move of then Loyola University to the area in 1928, and population growth in Los Angeles as a whole created a demand for housing in the area. Westchester was built with the intention of housing members of the working class. Westchester hosted the cross country part of the eventing equestrian event for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

In the late 1930s, real estate magnate Fritz Burns and his partner Fred W. Marlow developed a tract of inexpensive prefabricated single-family homes on the site of a former hog farm at the intersection of Manchester and Sepulveda Boulevards. This community, dubbed &quot;Westchester&quot;, grew as the aerospace industry boomed in World War II and afterward. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article in 1989 described the development as &quot;a raw suburb&quot;, &quot;created willy-nilly in the 1940s&quot;.

The area was predominantly residential. When the area had 30,000 residents, it was still lacking a police station, fire station, or hospital. It lacked a barber shop even by 1949.

The 1960s saw the introduction of airliners that could make trans-Pacific flights without refueling, causing a massive increase in air traffic at LAX. When the North Airfield Complex was constructed the increase in noise from jet takeoffs greatly decreased the desirability of the residential areas adjoining LAX. In response, the city of Los Angeles began a program of purchasing and condemning houses from noise-weary homeowners; as a result, a number of streets just north of the airport have been decommissioned, and the homes along those streets demolished. In all, Westchester lost 4,500 homes and 14,000 residents. The 18-hole Westchester golf course became a 15-hole course. In 2007 Los Angeles World Airport (LAWA) proposed another move of the north runway into Westchester; local opposition to LAX expansion (first proposed in the late 1990s) rose.

In February 2010, a NASA panel found that the north runway was safe and should stay as it is. That same month, LAWA broke ground on a $1.5 billion expansion of the Bradley International Terminal.

Construction of the LAX Consolidated Rent-A-Car Facility led to further mass demolitions of residential structures. The former Manchester Square neighborhood, a 120 acre tract spanning from Aviation to La Cienega and Arbor Vitae to Century, was acquired and demolished piecemeal beginning in 1999. A densely built-up area consisting of a mix of apartment complexes, duplexes, single family housing and schools, it had a population of over 7,000 in 1998 before the buyout program began. Because LAWA did not use eminent domain to acquire the area, remaining occupied housing coexisted with an increasing number of fenced-off vacant lots owned by LAWA for many years before the buyouts were completed. By 2004 nearly half the population had left, but the final buyouts and demolitions would not occur for nearly 15 years. In its final years, the remaining residents between the derelict properties were plagued with vandalism, illegal dumping, and an enormous homeless encampment with over 800 residents. In 2017 courts authorized the use of eminent domain to acquire the remaining parcels and the last owners all agreed to sell voluntarily shortly afterward. Combined with the 1970&#x27;s expansion, this brought the total number of Westchester residents displaced by LAX construction to well over 20,000.

Home prices rose 25 percent in 2013–14 while most southern California communities were recovering much more slowly. A major factor has been the influx of technology companies (including Hulu, Google, and Snap, Inc.) in Playa Vista as the Silicon Beach phenomenon in west Los Angeles has spread. The community also experienced a boom in home additions or complete rehabilitation of traditional postwar ranch-style houses into larger two-story homes. The Howard Hughes Center was a significant addition to the neighborhood in 2001 next to the San Diego Freeway. Development continued until by 2015 the complex had 1.3 million square feet of office space () in high-rise buildings, 3,200 apartments, and an updated, renovated shopping mall.

Since 2013, The cost of living in Westchester has continued to increase. In April 2017, the median sales price for single-family homes in April was $1.21 million - a 27% increase from a year prior.

<text>The IRCAM Signal Processing Workstation (ISPW) was a hardware digital audio workstation  developed by IRCAM and the Ariel Corporation in the late 1980s. In French, the ISPW is referred to as the SIM (&quot;Station d&#x27;informatique musicale&quot;). Eric Lindemann was the principal designer of the ISPW hardware as well as manager of the overall hardware/software effort. 

It consisted of up to three customized DSP boards that could be plugged into the expansion bus on a NeXT Computer (a &quot;cube&quot;). The ISPW could then run a customized real-time audio processing server on the hardware boards controlled by a client application on the NeXT.

Each ISPW card had two Intel i860 microprocessors (running at 80 MFLOPS). An additional card with eight channels of audio I/O was also available for multi-channel sound recording and playback. A three-board ISPW provided what was at the time unsurpassed signal processing and audio synthesis power on a single workstation. A single ISPW card cost approximately $12,000US (not including the computer), which made it prohibitively expensive outside of research institutes and universities.

And the I860 board :

The main server software developed by IRCAM for the ISPW was called FTS (&quot;Faster Than Sound&quot;). The main NeXT client application was a graphical program called Max, developed by Miller Puckette. A commercial version of Max (without the FTS server) was licensed by IRCAM to Opcode Systems (and, later, Cycling &#x27;74).

Max/FTS eventually migrated to a software-only application for SGI and DEC Alpha computers. It is the direct predecessor to jMax.

<doc id="481170" wikidata="Q3546960" url="?curid=481170" title="Fiddlehead">
<text>Fiddleheads or fiddlehead greens are the furled fronds from a fledgling fern, harvested for use as a vegetable. 

Left on the plant, each fiddlehead would unroll into a new frond (circinate vernation). As fiddleheads are harvested early in the season, before the frond has opened and reached its full height, they are cut fairly close to the ground.

Fiddleheads from brackens contain ptaquiloside, a compound associated with bracken toxicity, and thiaminase. Not all species contain ptaquiloside, such as &quot;Diplazium esculentum&quot;, a fern with fiddleheads regularly consumed in parts of East Asia, which differs from bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;).

The fiddlehead resembles the curled ornamentation (called a &quot;scroll&quot;) on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a fiddle. It is also called a crozier, after the curved staff used by bishops, which has its origins in the shepherd&#x27;s crook.

==Varieties==
The fiddleheads of certain ferns are eaten as a cooked leaf vegetable. The most popular of these are:

* Bracken, &quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;, found worldwide (Toxic if not cooked fully)
* Ostrich fern, &quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot;, found in northern regions worldwide, and the central/eastern part of North America &quot;(See health warning)&quot;
* Lady fern, &quot;Athyrium filix-femina&quot;, throughout most of the temperate northern hemisphere.
* Cinnamon fern or buckhorn fern, &quot;Osmunda cinnamomea&quot;, found in the eastern parts of North America, although not so palatable as ostrich fern.
* Royal fern, &quot;Osmunda regalis&quot;, found worldwide
* Midin, or &quot;Stenochlaena palustris&quot;, found in Sarawak, where it is prized as a local delicacy
* &quot;Zenmai&quot; or flowering fern, &quot;Osmunda japonica&quot;, found in East Asia
* Vegetable fern, &quot;Athyrium esculentum&quot;, found throughout Asia and Oceania
Fiddleheads&#x27; ornamental value makes them very expensive in the temperate regions where they are not abundant.

==Sources and harvesting==
Available seasonally, fiddleheads are both foraged and commercially harvested in spring. When picking fiddleheads, it is recommended to take only one third the tops per plant/cluster for sustainable harvest. Each plant produces several tops that turn into fronds.

==Culinary uses==

Fiddleheads have been part of traditional diets in much of Northern France since the beginning of the Middle Ages, across Asia, and also among Native Americans for centuries. They are also part of the diet in the Russian Far East where they are often picked in the wild in autumn, preserved in salt over winter, and then consumed in spring.

===Asian cuisine===
In Indonesia, young fiddlehead ferns are cooked in a rich coconut sauce spiced with chili pepper, galangal, lemongrass, turmeric leaves and other spices. This dish is called &quot;gulai pakis&quot; or &quot;gulai paku&quot;, and originated from the Minangkabau ethnic group of Indonesia.

In the Philippines, young fronds of &quot;Diplazium esculentum&quot; or &quot;pakô&quot; is a delicacy often made into a salad with tomato, salted egg slices, and a simple vinaigrette dressing.

In East Asia, fiddleheads of bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) are eaten as a vegetable, called &quot;kogomi&quot; () in Japan, &quot;gosari&quot; () in Korea, and &quot;juécài&quot; () in China and Taiwan. 

In Korea, a typical &quot;banchan&quot; (small side dish) is &quot;gosari-namul&quot; (), which consists of prepared fernbrake fiddleheads that have been sauteed. It is also a component of the popular dish &quot;bibimbap&quot;, &quot;yukgaejang&quot;, and &quot;bindae-tteok&quot;. In &quot;Jeju Island&quot;, southernmost island of South Korea, collecting it in April to May is a convention.

In Japan, bracken fiddleheads are a prized dish, and roasting the fiddleheads is reputed to neutralize any toxins in the vegetable. In Japan, fiddleheads of flowering fern (&quot;Osmunda japonica&quot;), known as &quot;zenmai&quot; (), as well as those of the ostrich fern (&quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot;), known as &quot;kogomi&quot; (), are commonly eaten in springtime. Fiddleheads in Japan are considered &quot;sansai&quot;, or wild vegetables. They are also traditionally used to make &quot;warabimochi,&quot; a Japanese-style dessert.

===Indian cuisine===
In the Indian subcontinent, it is found in the Himalayan states of North and Northeast India. In the state of Tripura, it is known as muikhonchok in the Kokborok language. As part of the Tripuri cuisine; fiddlehead fern is prepared by stir frying as bhaja served as a side dish. In Manipur it is known as &#x27;Chekoh&#x27; in the local Thadou language. It is usually eaten stir fried with chicken, eggs, prawns or other proteins.

In Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) it is called Lingad and used for vegetable pickling. In the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, it is known locally as and is used to make a pickle . In the Kangra Valley it is called in the Kangri dialect and is eaten as a vegetable. In Chamba it is known as &quot;kasrod&quot;.

In Darjeeling and Sikkim regions, it is called (नियुरो) and is common as a vegetable side dish, often mixed with local cheese and sometimes pickled. In Southern regions of West Bengal it is known as dheki shaak or dheki shaag.

In Assam, it is known as (); there it is a popular side dish. In the area of Jammu in Jammu and Kashmir, it&#x27;s known as &quot;kasrod&quot; (कसरोड). The most famous Dogra dish is &quot;kasrod ka achaar&quot; (fiddlehead fern pickle). In Poonch, it is known as &#x27;Kandor&#x27;(कंडोर) in local language. In Kishtwar, it is known as (टेड‍‌) in the local language Kishtwari. It is also cooked as a dry vegetable side dish to be eaten with rotis or parathas.

===Nepali cuisine===
In Nepal, it is a seasonal food called (नियुरो) or &quot;niuro&quot; (निउरो). There are three varieties of fiddlehead most commonly found in Nepali cuisine, namely सेती निउरो having whitish green stem, काली निउरो having dark purple stem, and ठूलो निउरो having large green stems. It is served as a vegetable side dish, often cooked in local clarified butter. It is also pickled.

===North American cooking===
Ostrich ferns (&quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot;), known locally as &quot;fiddleheads&quot;, grow wild in wet areas of northeastern North America in spring. The Maliseet, Mi&#x27;kmaq, and Penobscot peoples of Eastern Canada and Maine have traditionally harvested fiddleheads, and the vegetable was introduced first to the Acadian settlers in the early 18th century, and later to United Empire Loyalists as they began settling in New Brunswick in the 1780s. Fiddleheads remain a traditional dish in these regions, with most commercial harvesting occurring in New Brunswick, Quebec and Maine, and the vegetable is considered particularly emblematic of New Brunswick. North America&#x27;s largest grower, packer and distributor of wild fiddleheads established Ontario&#x27;s first commercial fiddlehead farm in Port Colborne in 2006. Fiddlehead-producing areas are also located in Nova Scotia, Vermont and New Hampshire. The Canadian village of Tide Head, New Brunswick bills itself as the &quot;Fiddlehead Capital of the World.&quot;

Fiddleheads are sold fresh and frozen. Fresh fiddleheads are available in the market for only a few weeks in springtime, and are fairly expensive. Pickled and frozen fiddleheads, however, can be found in some shops year-round. The vegetable is typically steamed, boiled and/or sautéed before being eaten hot, with hollandaise sauce, butter, lemon, vinegar and/or garlic, or chilled in salad or with mayonnaise.

To cook fiddleheads, it is advised to remove the brown papery husk before washing in several changes of cold water, then boil or steam them. Boiling reduces the bitterness and the content of tannins and toxins. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention associated a number of food-borne illness cases with fiddleheads in the early 1990s. Although they did not identify a toxin in the fiddleheads, the findings of that case suggest that fiddleheads should be cooked thoroughly before eating. The cooking time recommended by health authorities is 15 minutes if boiled and 10 to 12 minutes if steamed. The cooking method recommended by gourmets is to spread a thin layer in a steam basket and steam lightly, just until tender crisp.

=== Māori cuisine ===
Māori people have historically eaten young fern shoots called pikopiko, which can refer to several species of New Zealand ferns.

==Constituents==
Fiddleheads are low in sodium, but rich in potassium.

Many ferns also contain the enzyme thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine. This can lead to beriberi, if consumed in extreme excess.

Further, there is some evidence that certain varieties of fiddleheads, e.g. bracken (&quot;Pteridium&quot; genus), are toxic. It is recommended to fully cook fiddleheads to destroy the shikimic acid. Ostrich fern (&quot;Matteuccia struthiopteris&quot;) is not thought to cause cancer, although there is evidence it contains a toxin unidentified as yet.

<text>Kids&#x27; WB (stylized as Kids&#x27; WB!) was an American children&#x27;s programming block that originally aired on The WB from September 9, 1995, to September 16, 2006, and later on The CW from September 23, 2006, to May 17, 2008. Initially launched as a competitor to Fox Kids, Kids&#x27; WB aired primarily during the Saturday morning and weekday after-school time slots, although airtimes for the block&#x27;s programming varied at the local affiliate&#x27;s discretion.

In 1999, the block gained a major foothold in the children&#x27;s television market when it acquired the rights to 4Kids Entertainment&#x27;s English-dub of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime (which had previously been syndicated on Fox-affiliated stations the previous year), helping cement the anime as a pop culture phenomenon among American audiences. Other notable series during the block&#x27;s WB run included &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (a Fox Kids carryover) and spinoff &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; (which began as a WB prime time series), &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, &quot;The New Batman/Superman Adventures&quot;, &quot;Histeria!&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptors&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Test&quot;.

The block moved to The CW (a result of the merger of Time Warner-owned The WB and CBS Corporation-owned UPN) upon its launch in September 2006. Following a nearly 13-year run on broadcast television, on May 24, 2008, Kids&#x27; WB was replaced by successor block The CW4Kids (later renamed Toonzai in 2010) under a time-lease agreement reached between The CW and 4Kids Entertainment to take over programming the network&#x27;s Saturday morning timeslot. An online version of &quot;Kids&#x27; WB&quot; featuring episodes of popular series from the block operated from April 29, 2008, to May 17, 2015.

==History==
===1995–1999: Early years===
Kids&#x27; WB launched in the United States on September 9, 1995, striving to compete against the dominance of Fox Kids at the time, and airing on Saturday mornings from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. and Monday through Fridays from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The block was structured to air in all time zones, airing on a tape delay outside of the Eastern Time Zone to adjust the recommended airtime of the block to each zone. However, during its first five years, an exact timeslot was not announced on-air, leaving viewers to check their local WB station listings; since the programs had different airtimes depending on the local WB affiliate schedule in the market. On September 7, 1996, the Saturday block was extended by one hour, airing from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
Although Kids&#x27; WB aired on almost all of The WB&#x27;s affiliated stations (including those later affiliated with The WB 100+ Station Group), the network&#x27;s Chicago affiliate WGN-TV – owned by The WB&#x27;s co-parent, the Tribune Company – declined to carry the weekday and Saturday blocks. Instead, it opted to air its weekday and Saturday morning newscasts (the first incarnation of the latter was canceled in 1998), and other locally-produced programming (such as &quot;The Bozo Super Sunday Show&quot;) in the morning hours, and syndicated programming in the afternoons. Kids&#x27; WB programming instead aired on Weigel Broadcasting-owned WCIU-TV. However, WGN&#x27;s superstation feed carried the block from 1995 to 1999, making the network available to markets without a local affiliate. WGN-TV began clearing Kids&#x27; WB on its Chicago broadcast signal in 2004, taking over the local rights from WCIU-TV.

On September 1, 1997, a weekday morning block was added from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and the weekday afternoon block was extended by one hour, running from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. However, selected WB affiliates and WGN&#x27;s superstation feed would not begin airing the morning block until the following day, due to local preemptions caused by preexisting commitments to air &quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;. Some WB affiliates (such as WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles and KWGN-TV in Denver) aired the weekday morning and afternoon lineups together as an expanded three-hour block, running from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. On the same date, the block received an on-air rebranding – which included a revised logo and graphics package centered upon the Warner Bros. Studios lot theme that was also used in promotions for The WB&#x27;s primetime programming during the network&#x27;s first eight years on the air – which was developed by Riverstreet Productions, and lasted until 2005.

===1999–2006: Introduction of anime===
On February 13, 1999, Kids&#x27; WB made a breakthrough when the English dub of the anime series &quot;Pokémon&quot; by 4Kids Entertainment moved to the network from broadcast syndication. It became a major hit for the programming block, helping it beat Fox Kids with its animated lineup backed by Warner Bros. Other anime shows aired on Kids&#x27; WB in later years, such as &quot;Cardcaptors&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;.

In July 2001, Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s weekday afternoon lineup was rebranded as &quot;Toonami on Kids&#x27; WB&quot;, extending the Cartoon Network action-animated block Toonami to broadcast television, and bringing shows such as &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; to broadcast network television. However, the sub-block was critically panned by industry observers, who noticed that the action branding of the block - which had added shows such as &quot;Generation O!&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, and &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot;, a live-action series created by &quot;Goosebumps&quot; author R. L. Stine - did not translate content-wise. And while the cross promotion between Cartoon Network and Kids&#x27; WB did allow for series to be shared between the networks, most of these only lasted a short period of time. This included &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; appearing on &quot;Toonami on Kids&#x27; WB&quot; for only two weeks, and &quot;Cardcaptors&quot; appearing on the main Toonami block on Cartoon Network for only two weeks. In spring 2002, Kids&#x27; WB announced that they would drop the Toonami name from their weekday lineup, once again making the Toonami brand exclusive to Cartoon Network.

On September 3, 2001, the Kids&#x27; WB weekday morning block was discontinued, with The WB giving that slot back to its local affiliates to carry locally-produced shows, syndicated programming and/or infomercials.

On May 31, 2005, The WB announced that the weekday afternoon Kids&#x27; WB block would be discontinued &quot;at the request of the local affiliates,&quot; as it became financially unattractive due to the fact broadcast stations perceived that children&#x27;s programming viewership on afternoon timeslots had gravitated more towards cable networks – these stations began to target more adult audiences with talk shows and sitcom reruns in the daytime. Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s weekday programming continued, but with redundant programming and theme weeks until December 30, 2005 (the block began to increasingly promote Cartoon Network, their afternoon Miguzi block, &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;, and the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday morning lineup during the transition). The weekday afternoon Kids&#x27; WB block aired for the last time on December 30, 2005, and was replaced on January 2, 2006, by &quot;Daytime WB&quot;, a more adult-targeted general entertainment block featuring repeats of sitcoms and drama series formerly seen on the major networks. As a result, the Saturday morning Kids&#x27; WB lineup that remained was extended by one hour on January 7, 2006, running from 7:00 a.m. to noon, no longer affected by time zone variances.

===2006–2008: Move to The CW and closure===
On January 24, 2006, Warner Bros. Television (producer of &quot;Kids&#x27; WB&quot; and owner of the block&#x27;s original broadcaster from 1995 to 2006, The WB) and CBS Corporation (owner of UPN and subsidiary of National Amusements who also owns film studio Paramount Pictures&#x27; parent company Viacom) announced that they would merge both The WB and UPN and into The CW, which would primarily air programs aired by its two soon-to-be predecessor networks as part of its initial lineup. The combined network utilized The WB&#x27;s scheduling practices (inheriting the 30-hour weekly programming schedule that the network utilized at the time of the announcement) and brought the Kids&#x27; WB block, still run by Warner Bros. Television and maintaining the same name, to the new lineup (The CW&#x27;s decision to use The WB&#x27;s scheduling model was mainly due to the fact that it included children&#x27;s and daytime programming blocks that were not offered by UPN, which had not aired any children&#x27;s programming since the Disney&#x27;s One Too block was discontinued in August 2003). Notably, during this time AOL-then a sister company to Warner Bros.-was the main sponsor of CBS&#x27; own Saturday morning block KOL Secret Slumber Party, but at no point did neither Kids&#x27; WB nor SSP advertise each other&#x27;s programs-most likely because SSP was produced and operated by DIC Entertainment and was aimed at girls, as opposed to the boy-centric Kids&#x27; WB.
On October 2, 2007, The CW announced that it would discontinue the Kids&#x27; WB programming block through a joint decision between corporate parents Time Warner and CBS Corporation, due to the effects of children&#x27;s advertising limits and cable competition; the network also announced that it would sell the five-hour Saturday programming slot to 4Kids Entertainment. The Kids&#x27; WB block aired for the final time on May 17, 2008 (for some stations that aired the block on a day-behind basis, the block&#x27;s last airdate was on May 18, 2008).

On May 24, 2008, 4Kids launched The CW4Kids in place of Kids&#x27; WB. The lineup for the block consisted of 4Kids-produced shows, such as &quot;Chaotic&quot;, as well as new seasons of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. The official site, TheCW4Kids.com, officially launched on April 20, 2008. The block was renamed Toonzai on August 21, 2010, it was replaced by Vortexx (programmed by Saban Brands) on August 25, 2012, and it continued to air until it ended on September 27, 2014; the block that currently airs on The CW is One Magnificent Morning, which debuted on October 4, 2014.

===2008–present: Online networks===

On April 28, 2008, Warner Bros. Entertainment announced that The WB and Kids&#x27; WB brands would be relaunched as online networks, with the Kids&#x27; WB network consisting of five subchannels: &quot;Kids&#x27; WB!&quot; (for WB shows for kids and families), &quot;Kids&#x27; WB! Jr.&quot; (for shows for younger children), &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, and two different websites of &quot;DC Kids&quot;: &quot;DC HeroZone.com&quot; and &quot;DC Beyond.com&quot; (for action-oriented animated shows for DC fans). After the dissolution of In2TV, the Kids&#x27; WB online portal absorbed most of that service&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming. The service was significantly scaled back in 2013, with most of the archival content being removed. The archival content can be easily accessed through the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine.

The site was split into 3 websites on May 17, 2015. These sites are: DCKids.com, LooneyTunes.com and ScoobyDoo.com. All three are grouped into WB Kids Sites. The decision to split the site into three ended, after almost twenty years, the use of the &quot;Kids&#x27; WB!&quot; brand name. Also, the WB Kids Sites got new YouTube channels: WB Kids for main Warner Bros. properties, and DC Kids for DC Comics properties. In July 2016, 2 of the 3 websites re-merged into &quot;WBKids GO!&quot;. DCKids.com remains active until 2023. On December 14, 2023, the WBKids GO! and DC Kids websites appear to have been shut down; the links to their websites now redirect to the respective YouTube channels.

<doc id="481172" wikidata="Q6772354" url="?curid=481172" title="Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)">
<text>Maroon is the fifth full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies. The album was the follow-up to 1998&#x27;s &quot;Stunt&quot;, the band&#x27;s most successful album in the United States. &quot;Maroon&quot; debuted at No. 1 in Canada&lt;ref name=&quot;RPMSept25/00&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (their second to reach No. 1 after their 1992 debut &quot;Gordon&quot;) and No. 5 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In its first week, the album sold 17,800 copies in Canada and just under 128,000 in the US. It has sold at least 1 million copies in the US alone. The album spawned three hit singles: &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; and &quot;Falling for the First Time&quot;.

Unlike past albums, the songs came almost entirely from the pairing of Page/Robertson. One track, &quot;Baby Seat&quot;, was written by Page with longtime songwriting partner, Stephen Duffy. This was the last Page/Duffy track that Barenaked Ladies would release, starting a policy of keeping the writing within the band on their next album. &quot;Hidden Sun&quot;, written while Hearn was in the hospital, appears as a hidden track on most copies of the album. As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, &quot;Humour of the Situation&quot;, completely naked.

The band recorded 17 tracks for the album; Tracks recorded for this album but omitted from the finished record include: &quot;Powder Blue&quot; (appears on the US &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single), &quot;Inline Bowline&quot; (appears as an extra track on some international versions, and is on the Australian &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single), &quot;Born Human&quot; (appears on the Australian &quot;Pinch Me&quot; single, re-recorded for Hearn&#x27;s album &quot;Night Light&quot;) and &quot;Half a Heart&quot; (re-recorded for the &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot; sessions before the &quot;Maroon&quot; sessions version was later released on &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before!&quot;). &quot;That&#x27;s All, That&#x27;s All&quot; was also written for the album, and was later recorded for Page&#x27;s &quot;The Vanity Project&quot;.

The album was the first Barenaked Ladies album released on DVD-Audio in a 5.1 surround sound mix. In 2020, a 20th Anniversary Edition was released digitally, and was announced for a vinyl release in early 2021. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes contains the three contemporary B-sides recorded for the album (not including &quot;Half a Heart&quot;) as well as a demo version of &quot;Falling for the First Time&quot;, and a previously unreleased &quot;alternate&quot; version of &quot;Green Christmas&quot;. Also, &quot;Hidden Sun&quot; is separated into its own track.

<text>Zomba is a city in southern Malawi, in the Shire Highlands. It is the former capital city of Malawi.

It was the capital of first British Central Africa and then Nyasaland Protectorate before the establishment of Malawi in 1964. It was also the first capital of Malawi and remained so until 1974, when Lilongwe became the capital. The Parliament remained even longer, until 1994. The city is best known for its British colonial architecture and its location at the base of the dramatic Zomba Plateau. Zomba is also the home of Chancellor College of the University of Malawi.

==History==
The town&#x27;s British colonial past is reflected in the architecture of its older buildings and homes. Zomba was once a hub for expatriates in Malawi. Its diverse cultural mix included British tobacco farmers and Dutch, German and U.S. emissaries. The British also established Sir Harry Johnston Primary School. The Zomba Gymkhana Club was once the focus for social activity in the expatriate community. However, in recent years, the club&#x27;s appearance and reputation have been in decline. The Zomba Gymkhana Club was where the Malawi Rock Shandy was created by the head barman Shadrack in the 1960s. Next to the old parliament building is the botanical garden, which was established by the British, as well as the golf course in the city centre. At the southern entrance to the city, the King&#x27;s African Rifles memorial is positioned right next to the M1.

During British rule, Zomba served as capital under British Central Africa and later the Nyasaland Protectorate. It was the capital city of independent Malawi from 1964 to 1975.

==Economy==
Zomba is the centre for the tobacco and dairy farms of the surrounding area, which also produces rice, corn (maize), fish, and softwoods. Timber is extracted from the nearby plateau.

A market can be found in the town centre, where farmers from surrounding villages sell their products, as well as secondhand clothes and basic consumer goods. Also fresh and dried fish from Lake Malawi and Lake Chilwa are sold. Local supermarkets, such as Peoples Trading Company, Metro and Shoprite are located near the bus depot. A dozen, mainly Indian- and Chinese-owned, shops sell imported clothes, electrical appliances, bicycles and other basic goods. Along the M1, several filling stations can be found.
National Bank of Malawi, NBS savings Bank, Standard Bank and Opportunity Bank International as well as the Malawian Post have branches in the city.

Zomba Hospital is an important employer and one of the biggest hospitals in the country.

Zomba Central Prison was built in 1935, and is the only maximum-security prison in Malawi.

===Tourism===
The main attraction in Zomba is the Zomba Plateau. Activities offered include rock climbing, birdwatching, fishing and mountain-biking. The &quot;Ku Chawe Inn&quot;, situated right on the edge of the plateau, is the most luxurious hotel in the area. Tourists also can sleep in log houses or camp at the trout farm. Within the town, two backpacker hostels and several lodges, ranging from basic to mid-class, are open for guests. A craft market provides locally made souvenirs.

==Education==
===University of Malawi===
Chancellor College, the largest of the constituent colleges of the University of Malawi, is located in Zomba. The college has five faculties: Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Social Science and Faculty of Education.

===Sir Harry Johnston International Primary School===
Sir Harry Johnston International School has served the international and local community since 1958. The primary school consists of a seven classroom block (pre-Nursery to year 6) and the secondary school consists of three classrooms and a science laboratory. There is also a spacious multi-purpose hall on site used by both schools. Within the grounds there is a swimming pool, a football and netball field, a basketball court, a cross-country track, a playground and a nursery play area.
The curriculum is based on the British National Curriculum in the Primary and the Cambridge Curriculum in the Secondary School, but content is adapted for the needs of the school population.
The school is centrally located on Kalimbuka Road. It has students from a range of nationalities with around 80% of the students Malawian. The school is non-profit making and is managed by an elected board of trustees from the parent community.
The school&#x27;s swimming-pool is open to public from September to May each year.

===Zomba Catholic Secondary School===
Located around from the Old Capital city&#x27;s town centre, this is a government-funded school founded in 1942 by the Catholic church. A community of Marist Brothers is located on site and the Brothers help with the teaching. Although funded by the government, pupils are still required to pay fees (MK107,000 per term as of 2017) as they live on campus and must pay board. The school is one of the best government schools in Malawi and competition for entry is intense. The school has around 600 pupils and 30 teachers as well as several administrative staff.
It is also well known as Box 2 and BOCCO (Boys Of Courage And Cooperation).

===Zomba Theological College===

<text>John Anthony Franco (born September 17, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed relief pitcher between and . Franco established himself as an All-Star player with the Cincinnati Reds before spending the majority of his career with the New York Mets. He ended his 21-year career with one final season with the Houston Astros.

Franco&#x27;s 1,119 career games pitched is a National League record, and ranks fourth in major league history. His 424 career saves ranks seventh all-time in major league history (ranking second when he retired), and remains the most by a left-hander. For 15 of his 21 seasons, he played for the New York Mets, serving as team captain in his final years with the team. Franco was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Franco, who is of Italian heritage, grew up in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. His father, Jim Franco, was a New York City Department of Sanitation worker who encouraged his son&#x27;s baseball aspirations; Franco honored his father by wearing an orange Sanitation Department work-shirt under his jersey. John graduated from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn and St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, where he pitched two no-hitters in his freshman year. In 1980, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Career==

Franco was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 8, , in the 5th round of the amateur draft. Before reaching the major leagues, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on May 9, , with Brett Wise for Rafael Landestoy. Landestoy batted under .200 before retiring the following year while Franco was a star reliever for much of the next two decades. Franco debuted with the Reds on April 24, . Franco was a traditional relief pitcher with a &quot;90-mph fastball and a change-up that breaks away from a righthanded batter like a screwball.&quot;

Throughout his six seasons with the Reds, Franco was a successful closer, winning the National League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in . He helped the Reds finish second four seasons in a row (1985–1988).

On December 6, , at the age of 29, he was traded with Don Brown to the Mets for Randy Myers and Kip Gross. He remained with the Mets organization until the end of the 2004 season. During his time with the Mets, he won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in , became team captain, and remained the closer until , when he moved to a setup role for new closer Armando Benítez. He led the league in saves for the 1988, 1990, and 1994 seasons. He reached the postseason for the first time in 1999 and the World Series in 2000.

On May 11, 1996, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, the Mets held &quot;John Franco Day&quot; to celebrate his 300th career save. In the fifth inning, a brawl that cleared both benches and bullpens resulted in Franco being ejected from the game, along with eight other players.

Injuries caused Franco to miss the baseball season, but he made a successful recovery from surgery and returned in June . He signed a one-year contract for the season. He finished with a 2-7 record with 36 strikeouts and a 5.28 ERA in 46 innings.

In January 2005, he was signed to a one-year deal with the Astros, at the age of 44, making him at that time the oldest active pitcher in Major League Baseball. On July 1, , Franco was designated for assignment, and he was subsequently released, which proved to be the end of his baseball career.

==Personal life==
John married his high school sweetheart, Rose, whom he has known since he was 17.

His son J.J. Franco, who was drafted by the Mets out of high school, attended Brown University, where he played as an infielder. J.J. was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 2014 MLB draft and played with the Braves and Mets minor league systems through the 2018 season. Franco&#x27;s cousin, Scott Pagano, played minor league baseball.

Throughout his career, Franco supplied tickets to members of the Bonanno crime family of the Italian-American Mafia and on one occasion Canadian organized crime figures, according to FBI documents made public in 2004. There was no suggestion that he committed any crimes but his behavior was a violation of Major League Baseball rules forbidding contact with known criminals.

==Media==
Franco appeared on the television show &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot; during season three.

During an interview, he revealed that he threw a circle changeup which was often mistaken for a screwball.

==Honors==

Franco was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame in 2008. He was also inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

On March 29, 2009, Franco threw the ceremonial first pitch in the first game played on Citi Field, a Big East college game between St. John&#x27;s (his alma mater) and Georgetown.

On June 3, 2012, in a ceremony at Citi Field, Franco was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

<doc id="481177" wikidata="Q384180" url="?curid=481177" title="Black Moon (album)">
<text>Black Moon is the eighth studio album, and the first in fourteen years, by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released in May 1992. The band had broken up in 1979, and recorded &quot;Black Moon&quot; to kick off their 1990s revival.

==Production==
The track &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot; originated in summer 1988 sessions by Lake with Geoff Downes under the project name Ride the Tiger. The Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer version is more guitar-oriented and includes a bridge not present on the original version. Another song from the sessions, &quot;Money Talks&quot;, became &quot;Paper Blood&quot; with a different chorus and new music. Ride the Tiger was finally released in 2015.

==Reception==

&quot;Black Moon&quot; received mixed reviews. Jim Allen of AllMusic wrote in a retrospective review that the performers &quot;stripped down their sound and amped up their attack.&quot; In his book &quot;The Music&#x27;s All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock&quot;, Paul Stump compared it favorably to its contemporary &quot;Union&quot; (by fellow progressive rock giants Yes). He explained that &quot;Black Moon&quot; &quot;did at least aspire to interest and &quot;excite&quot; the listener, and it would be a churlish mind that overlooked a vigour in the playing which had formerly been notable by its absence. The material, though, suffered from the Yes malaise: cynicism and over-exposure to the wallet-fattening blandishments of easy-out FM mores, intervals and development procedures had blunted edges and dulled nerve-endings both of players and listeners.&quot;

Half of the album&#x27;s songs were played at the band&#x27;s 1992-1993 concerts. Greg Lake included the songs &quot;Paper Blood&quot;, &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; and &quot;Footprints in the Snow&quot; in the setlist of his 2005 solo tour. &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; was played at the group&#x27;s final concert, at the High Voltage Festival in July 2010.

<doc id="481187" wikidata="Q33273" url="?curid=481187" title="Chewa language">
<text>Chewa (also known as Nyanja, ) is a Bantu language spoken in Malawi and a recognised minority in Zambia and Mozambique. The noun class prefix &quot;chi-&quot; is used for languages, so the language is usually called and . In Malawi, the name was officially changed from Chinyanja to Chichewa in 1968 at the insistence of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda (himself of the Chewa people), and this is still the name most commonly used in Malawi today. In Zambia, the language is generally known as Nyanja or &#x27;(language) of the lake&#x27; (referring to Lake Malawi).

Chewa belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Tumbuka, Sena and Nsenga. Throughout the history of Malawi, only Chewa and Tumbuka have at one time been the primary dominant national languages used by government officials and in school curricula. However, the Tumbuka language suffered a lot during the rule of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, since in 1968 as a result of his one-nation, one-language policy it lost its status as an official language in Malawi. As a result, Tumbuka was removed from the school curriculum, the national radio, and the print media. With the advent of multi-party democracy in 1994, Tumbuka programmes were started again on the radio, but the number of books and other publications in Tumbuka remains low.

== Distribution ==
Chewa is the most widely known language of Malawi, spoken mostly in the Central and Southern Regions of that country. It is also spoken in Eastern Province of Zambia, as well as in Mozambique, especially in the provinces of Tete and Niassa. It was one of the 55 languages featured on the Voyager spacecraft.

== History ==
The Chewa were a branch of the Maravi people who lived in the Eastern Province of Zambia and in northern Mozambique as far south as the River Zambezi from the 16th century or earlier.

The name &quot;Chewa&quot; (in the form &quot;Chévas&quot;) was first recorded by António Gamitto, who at the age of 26 in 1831 was appointed as second-in-command of an expedition from Tete to the court of King Kazembe in what became Zambia. His route took him through the country of King Undi west of the Dzalanyama mountains, across a corner of present-day Malawi and on into Zambia. Later he wrote an account including some ethnographic and linguistic notes and vocabularies. According to Gamitto, the Malawi or Maravi people (&quot;Maraves&quot;) were those ruled by King Undi south of the Chambwe stream (not far south of the present border between Mozambique and Zambia), while the Chewa lived north of the Chambwe.

Another, more extensive, list of 263 words and phrases of the language was made by the German missionary Sigismund Koelle who, working in Sierra Leone in West Africa, interviewed some 160 former slaves and recorded vocabularies in their languages. He published the results in a book called &quot;Polyglotta Africana&quot; in 1854. Among other slaves was one Mateke, who spoke what he calls &quot;Maravi&quot;. Mateke&#x27;s language is clearly an early form of Nyanja, but in a southern dialect. For example, the modern Chichewa phrase &#x27;two years&#x27; was in Mateke&#x27;s speech, whereas for Johannes Rebmann&#x27;s informant Salimini, who came from the Lilongwe region, it was . The same dialect difference survives today in the word or &#x27;(to) plant&#x27;.

Apart from the few words recorded by Gamitto and Koelle, the first extensive record of the Chewa language was made by Johannes Rebmann in his &quot;Dictionary of the Kiniassa Language&quot;, published in 1877 but written in 1853–4. Rebmann was a missionary living near Mombasa in Kenya, and he obtained his information from a Malawian slave, known by the Swahili name Salimini, who had been captured in Malawi some ten years earlier. Salimini, who came from a place called Mphande apparently in the Lilongwe region, also noted some differences between his own dialect, which he called , the &quot;language of the plateau&quot;, and the dialect spoken further south; for example, the Maravi gave the name to the tree which he himself called .

The first grammar, &quot;A Grammar of the Chinyanja language as spoken at Lake Nyasa with Chinyanja–English and English–Chinyanja vocabulary&quot;, was written by Alexander Riddel in 1880. Further early grammars and vocabularies include &quot;A grammar of Chinyanja, a language spoken in British Central Africa, on and near the shores of Lake Nyasa&quot; by George Henry (1891) and M.E. Woodward&#x27;s &quot;A vocabulary of English–Chinyanja and Chinyanja–English: as spoken at Likoma, Lake Nyasa&quot; (1895). The whole Bible was translated into the Likoma Island dialect of Nyanja by William Percival Johnson and published as in 1912. Another Bible translation, known as the , was made in a more standard Central Region dialect about 1900–1922 by missionaries of the Dutch Reformed Mission and Church of Scotland with the help of some Malawians. This has recently (2016) been reissued in a revised and slightly modernised version.

Another early grammar, concentrating on the Kasungu dialect of the language, was Mark Hanna Watkins&#x27; &quot;A Grammar of Chichewa&quot; (1937). This book, the first grammar of any African language to be written by an American, was a work of cooperation between a young black PhD student and young student from Nyasaland studying in Chicago, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who in 1966 was to become the first President of the Republic of Malawi. This grammar is also remarkable in that it was the first to mark the tones of the words. Modern monographs on aspects of Chichewa grammar include Mtenje (1986), Kanerva (1990), Mchombo (2004) and Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017).

In recent years the language has changed considerably, and a dichotomy has grown between the traditional Chichewa of the villages and the language of city-dwellers.

== Phonology ==

===Vowels===

Chewa has five short vowel sounds: a, ɛ, i, ɔ, u; these are written &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;. Long vowels are sometimes found, e.g. &quot;áákúlu&quot; &#x27;big&#x27; (class 2), &quot;kufúula&quot; &#x27;to shout&#x27;. When a word comes at the end of a phrase, its penultimate vowel tends to be lengthened, except for non-Chewa names and words, such as or , in which the penultimate vowel always remains short. The added &#x27;u&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27; in borrowed words such as &#x27;laptop&#x27; or &#x27;internet&#x27; tends to be very short.
Vowels are generally lengthened in the penultimate syllable of a prosodic phrase.

===Consonants===

Chewa consonants can be simple (directly preceding a vowel) or may be followed by &quot;w&quot; or &quot;y&quot;:

*&quot;b&quot;, &quot;kh&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;s&quot; etc.
*&quot;bw&quot;, &quot;khw&quot;, &quot;gw&quot;, &quot;fw&quot;, &quot;mw&quot;, &quot;sw&quot; etc.
*&quot;bz&quot;, &quot;tch&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;fy&quot;, &quot;ny&quot;, &quot;sh&quot; etc.

In the orthography, the place of &quot;by&quot; is taken by the affricate &quot;bz&quot;, the place of &quot;gy&quot; is taken by &quot;j&quot;, and that of &quot;sy&quot; by &quot;sh&quot;.

Voiced and aspirated consonants, as well as [f] and [s], can also be preceded by a homorganic nasal:
*&quot;mb&quot;, &quot;ngw&quot;, &quot;nj&quot;, &quot;mv&quot;, &quot;nz&quot; etc.
*&quot;mph&quot;, , , &quot;mf&quot;, &quot;ns&quot; etc.

It is debated whether these are consonant clusters , or whether Chichewa has prenasalized, palatalized and labialized consonants . The most straightforward analysis is that they are clusters. The consonant inventory under a cluster analysis is as follows:

Consonants in parentheses are marginal or found mainly in loanwords. The lateral is an approximant word-initially and a flap medially.

If the more complex syllable onsets are analyzed as single consonants, the inventory is as follows:
The spelling used here is that introduced in 1973, which is the one generally in use in the Malawi at the present time, replacing the &quot;Chinyanja Orthography Rules&quot; of 1931.

Notes on the consonants

*In most words, Chewa &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; (when not prenasalised) are pronounced implosively, by sucking slightly. However, there is also a plosive &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, mostly found in foreign words, such as &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;expensive&#x27; (from Afrikaans ) (in contrast to the implosive &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in native words such as &#x27;wound&#x27; and &#x27;which cuts&#x27;). A plosive &quot;d&quot; is also found in &#x27;to stamp (a document)&#x27; and &#x27;confident step&#x27;.
*The affricate sounds &quot;bv&quot; and &quot;pf&quot; were formerly commonly heard but are now generally replaced by &quot;v&quot; and &quot;f&quot;, e.g. &#x27;problem&#x27;, &#x27;bone&#x27;. In the dictionary produced by the University of Malawi, the spellings &quot;bv&quot; and &quot;pf&quot; are not used in any of the headwords, but &quot;bv&quot; is used two or three times in the definitions.
*The combination &quot;bz&quot; is described by Atkins as an &quot;alveolar-labialised fricative&quot;. The combination sounds approximately as or . Similarly &quot;ps&quot; is pronounced approximately as or .
*The sounds written &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are pronounced less forcibly than the English equivalents and generally without aspiration. Stevick notes that in relaxed speech, the first three are sometimes replaced with the voiced fricatives , and , and &quot;t&quot; can be heard as a voiced flap. In the combination &quot;-ti&quot; (e.g. &#x27;how many&#x27;), &quot;t&quot; may be lightly aspirated.
*&quot;h&quot; is also used in Chewa but mostly only in loanwords such as &#x27;hotel&#x27;, &#x27;horse&#x27;, &#x27;monthly allowance given to chiefs&#x27;.
*&quot;j&quot; is described by Scotton and Orr as being pronounced &quot;somewhat more forward in the mouth&quot; than in English and as sounding &quot;somewhere between an English &quot;d&quot; and &quot;j&quot;&quot;.
*&quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are the same phoneme, representing a retroflex tap , approximately between and . According to the official spelling rules, the sound is written as &#x27;r&#x27; after &#x27;i&#x27; or &#x27;e&#x27;, otherwise &#x27;l&#x27;. It is also written with &#x27;l&#x27; after a prefix containing &#x27;i&#x27;, as in &#x27;tongue&#x27;. 
*&quot;m&quot; is syllabic in words where it is derived from &quot;mu&quot;, e.g. &#x27;relative&#x27; (3 syllables), &#x27;teacher&#x27; (4 syllables), &#x27;he gave him&#x27; (5 syllables). However, in class 9 words, such as &#x27;gift&#x27;, &#x27;plate&#x27;, or &#x27;witch&#x27;, and also in the class 1 word &#x27;cat&#x27;, the &quot;m&quot; is pronounced very short and does not form a separate syllable. In Southern Region dialects of Malawi, the syllabic &quot;m&quot; in words like &#x27;lion&#x27; is pronounced in a homorganic manner, i.e. (with three syllables), but in the Central Region, it is pronounced as it is written, i.e. .
*&quot;n&quot;, in combinations such as &quot;nj&quot;, , &quot;nkh&quot; etc., is assimilated to the following consonant, that is, it is pronounced or as appropriate. In words of class 9, such as &#x27;snake&#x27; or &#x27;minister&#x27; it is pronounced very short, as part of the following syllable. However, [n] can also be syllabic, when it is contracted from &quot;ndi&quot; &#x27;it is&#x27; or &quot;ndí&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;, e.g. &#x27;and to go&#x27;; also in the remote past continuous tense, e.g. &#x27;he used to go&#x27;. In some borrowed words such as or the combinations &quot;nk&quot; and &quot;nt&quot; with non-syllabic &quot;n&quot; can be found but not in native words.
*&quot;ng&quot; is pronounced as in &#x27;finger&#x27; and &quot;ng’&quot; is pronounced as in &#x27;singer&#x27;. Both of these consonants can occur at the beginning of a word: &#x27;kudu&#x27;, &#x27;cow or ox&#x27;.
*&quot;w&quot; in the combinations &quot;awu&quot;, &quot;ewu&quot;, &quot;iwu&quot;, &quot;owa&quot;, &quot;uwa&quot; (e.g. &#x27;voice&#x27;, &#x27;road&#x27;, &#x27;sound&#x27;, &#x27;enter&#x27;, &#x27;flower&#x27;) although often written is generally not pronounced. Combinations such as &quot;gwo&quot; or &quot;mwo&quot; are not found; thus (short for ) &#x27;he is good&#x27; but (short for ) &#x27;he is bad&#x27;; &#x27;stone&#x27; but &#x27;fire&#x27;. 
*&quot;ŵ&quot;, a &quot;closely lip-rounded with the tongue in the close-i position&quot;, was formerly used in Central Region dialects but is now rarely heard, usually being replaced by &#x27;w&#x27;. (&quot;It is doubtful whether the majority of speakers have in their phoneme inventory&quot; (Kishindo).) The symbol &#x27;ŵ&#x27; is generally omitted in current publications such as newspapers. In the dialects that use the sound, it is found only before a, i, and e, while before o and u it becomes . To some linguists (e.g. Watkins) it sounds similar to the Spanish .
*&quot;zy&quot; (as in &#x27;be upside down like a bat&#x27;) can be pronounced .

===Tones===

Like most other Bantu languages, Chewa is a tonal language; that is to say, the pitch of the syllables (high or low) plays an important role in it. Tone is used in various ways in the language. First of all, each word has its own tonal pattern, for example:
* &#x27;person&#x27; (Low, Low)
* &#x27;dog&#x27; (Rising, Mid)
* &#x27;goat&#x27; (Falling, Low)
* &#x27;maize&#x27; (High, Low, Low)

Usually there is only one high tone in a word (generally on one of the last three syllables), or none. However, in compound words there can be more than one high tone, for example:
* &#x27;food&#x27; (High, High, High; derived from + , &#x27;a thing of eating&#x27;)

A second important use of tone is in the verb. Each tense of the verb has its own characteristic tonal pattern (negative tenses usually have a different pattern from positive ones). For example, the present habitual has high tones on the initial syllable and the penultimate, the other syllables being low:
* &#x27;I (usually) help&#x27;

The recent past continuous and present continuous, on the other hand, have a tone on the third syllable:
* &#x27;I was helping&#x27;
* &#x27;I am helping&#x27;

Tones can also indicate whether a verb is being used in a main clause or in a dependent clause such as a relative clause:
* &#x27;the week has ended&#x27;
* &#x27;the week which has ended (i.e. last week)&#x27;

A third use of tones in Chewa is to show phrasing and sentence intonation. For example, immediately before a pause in the middle of a sentence the speaker&#x27;s voice tends to rise up; this rise is referred to as a boundary tone. Other intonational tones are sometimes heard, for example a rising or falling tone at the end of a yes-no question.

==Grammar==

===Noun classes===
Chewa nouns are divided for convenience into a number of classes, which are referred to by the Malawians themselves by names such as &quot;Mu-A-&quot;, but by Bantu specialists by numbers such as &quot;1/2&quot;, corresponding to the classes in other Bantu languages. Conventionally, they are grouped into pairs of singular and plural. However, irregular pairings are also possible, especially with loanwords; for example, &#x27;bank&#x27;, which takes the concords of class 9 in the singular, has a plural (class 6).

When assigning nouns to a particular class, initially the prefix of the noun is used. Where there is no prefix, or where the prefix is ambiguous, the concords (see below) are used as a guide to the noun class. For example, &#x27;possessions&#x27; is put in class 1, since it takes the class 1 demonstrative &#x27;this&#x27;.

Some nouns belong to one class only, e.g. &quot; (class 1), &#x27;beer&#x27; (class 3), &quot; (class 6), &quot; (class 14), and do not change between singular and plural. Despite this, such words can still be counted if appropriate: &#x27;two tomatoes&#x27;, &#x27;two beers&#x27;, &#x27;one shirt&#x27;, &#x27;one mosquito&#x27;.

Class 11 (Lu-) is not found in Chewa. Words like &#x27;razor&#x27; and &#x27;skill&#x27; are considered to belong to class 5/6 (Li-Ma-) and take the concords of that class.

*Mu-A- (1/2): pl. &#x27;person&#x27;; pl. &#x27;teacher&#x27;; pl. &#x27;child&#x27;(1a/2): pl. &#x27;dog&#x27;. Class 1a refers to nouns which have no prefix.The plural is used only for humans and animals. It can also be used for respect, e.g. &#x27;our teacher&#x27;(1a/6): pl. &#x27;key&#x27;; pl. &#x27;dance&#x27;(1a): &quot;; &#x27;luggage, furniture&#x27;; &#x27;fertilizer&#x27; (no pl.)
*Mu-Mi- (3/4): pl. &#x27;village&#x27;; pl. &#x27;tree&#x27;; pl. &#x27;life&#x27;; pl. &#x27;village&#x27;(3): &#x27;beer&#x27;; &#x27;fire&#x27;; &quot; (no pl.)
*Li-Ma- (5/6): pl. &#x27;name&#x27;; pl. &#x27;problem&#x27;; pl. &#x27;hoe&#x27;; pl. &#x27;eye&#x27;Often the first consonant is softened or omitted in the plural in this class.(6): &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;medicine&#x27;, &#x27;place&#x27; (no sg.)
*Chi-Zi- (7/8): pl. &#x27;thing&#x27;; pl. &#x27;year&#x27;(7): &#x27;maize&#x27;; &#x27;love&#x27; (no pl.)
*I-Zi- (9/10): pl. &#x27;house&#x27;; pl. &#x27;goat&#x27;(10): &#x27;beard&#x27;; &#x27;relish&#x27;; &#x27;intelligence&#x27; (no sg.)(9/6): pl. &#x27;bank&#x27;
*Ka-Ti- (12/13): pl. &#x27;baby&#x27;; pl. &#x27;small thing&#x27;(12): &#x27;method of taking care&#x27;; &#x27;way of dancing&#x27; (no pl.)(13): &#x27;sleep&#x27; (no sg.)
*U-Ma- (14): &#x27;night time&#x27;; &#x27;farming&#x27;; &quot; (no pl.)(14/6): pl. &#x27;bow&#x27;

Infinitive class:
*Ku- (15): &#x27;to see, seeing&#x27;

Locative classes:
*Pa- (16): &#x27;mouth&#x27;
*Ku- (17): &#x27;neck&#x27;
*Mu- (18): &#x27;inside the mouth&#x27;

===Concords===
Pronouns, adjectives, and verbs have to show agreement with nouns in Chichewa. This is done by means of prefixes, for example:
* &#x27;this is my child&#x27; (class 1)
* &#x27;these are my children&#x27; (class 2)
* &#x27;this is my maize&#x27; (class 7)
* &#x27;this is my house&#x27; (class 9)

Class 2 (the plural of class 1) is often used for respect when referring to elders. According to Corbett and Mtenje, a word like &#x27;father&#x27;, even though it is singular, will take plural concords (e.g. &#x27;my father is walking, I see him&#x27;); they note that to use the singular object-marker would be &#x27;grossly impolite&#x27;.

The various prefixes are shown on the table below:

There are 17 different noun classes, but because some of them share concords there are in fact only 12 distinct sets of prefixes.

===Examples of the use of concords===
In the examples below, the concords are illustrated mainly with nouns of classes 1 and 2.

====Demonstratives &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27;====
* &#x27;who is this?&#x27;; &#x27;who are these?&#x27; (or: &#x27;who is this gentleman?&#x27; (respectful))
* () &#x27;this child&#x27;; () &#x27;these children&#x27;
* () &#x27;that child&#x27;; () &#x27;those children&#x27;

The shortened forms are more common.

====Pronominal , etc.====
Prefixed by a supporting vowel, or by &#x27;with&#x27; or &#x27;it is&#x27;, these make the pronouns &#x27;he/she&#x27; and &#x27;they&#x27;:
* &#x27;he/she&#x27;; &#x27;they&#x27; (or &#x27;he/she&#x27; (respectful))
* &#x27;with him/her&#x27;; &#x27;with them&#x27; (or &#x27;with him/her&#x27; (respectful))
* &#x27;it is he/she&#x27;; &#x27;it is they&#x27;

For classes other than classes 1 and 2, a demonstrative is used instead of a freestanding pronoun, for example in class 6 or . But forms prefixed by and such as and are found.
The three pronominal adjectives &#x27;all&#x27;, &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;that same&#x27; (or &#x27;who&#x27;) have the same pronominal concords and , this time as prefixes:
* &#x27;the whole of Malawi&#x27;
* &#x27;all the children&#x27;
* &#x27;on his/her own&#x27;
* &#x27;on their own&#x27;
* &#x27;that same child&#x27;
* &#x27;those same children&#x27;

In classes 2 and 6, often becomes (e.g. for etc.).

The commonly used word &#x27;every&#x27; is compounded from the verb &#x27;who is&#x27; and &#x27;all&#x27;. Both parts of the word have concords:
* &#x27;every child&#x27;
* &#x27;every two children&#x27;
* &#x27;every house&#x27; (class 4)
* &#x27;every year&#x27; (class 7)

====Subject prefix====
As with other &quot;Bantu languages&quot;, all Chewa verbs have a prefix which agrees with the subject of the verb. In modern Chewa, the class 2 prefix (formerly ) has become , identical with the prefix of class 1:
* &#x27;the child will go&#x27;; &#x27;the children will go&#x27;

The perfect tense ( &#x27;he/she has gone&#x27;, &#x27;they have gone&#x27;) has different subject prefixes from the other tenses (see below).

==== &#x27;who&#x27;====
The relative pronoun &#x27;who&#x27; and demonstrative use the same prefixes as a verb:
* &#x27;the child who&#x27;
* &#x27;the children who&#x27;
* &#x27;that child&#x27;
* &#x27;those children&#x27;
* &#x27;that house&#x27;
* &#x27;those houses&#x27;

====Object infix====
The use of an object infix is not obligatory in Chewa (for example, means &#x27;I have bought (them)&#x27;). If used, it comes immediately before the verb root, and agrees with the object:
* &#x27;I have seen him/her&#x27;; &#x27;I have seen them&#x27; (sometimes shortened to ).

The object infix of classes 16, 17, and 18 is usually replaced by a suffix: &#x27;I have seen inside it&#x27;.

The same infix with verbs with the applicative suffix represents the indirect object, e.g. &#x27;I have written to him&#x27;.

====Numeral concords====
Numeral concords are used with numbers &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27;, &#x27;three&#x27;, &#x27;four&#x27;, &#x27;five&#x27;, and the words &#x27;how many&#x27;, &#x27;several&#x27;:
* &#x27;one child&#x27;; &#x27;two children&#x27;; &#x27;how many children?&#x27;

The class 1 prefix becomes before : &#x27;two tomatoes&#x27;.

The number &#x27;ten&#x27; has no concord.

====Demonstratives and ====
The demonstrative pronouns &#x27;that one you know&#x27; and &#x27;this one we are in&#x27; take the concords and in classes 1 and 2. For semantic reasons, class 1 is rare:
* &#x27;that child (the one you know)&#x27;; &#x27;those children&#x27; (those ones you know)
* &#x27;this month (we are in)&#x27; (class 3); &#x27;these days&#x27;; &#x27;here in Malawi (where we are now)&#x27; (class 17).

====Perfect tense subject prefix====
The same concords (derived from ) and , combined with the vowel , make the subject prefix of the perfect tense. In the plural the two prefixes combine into a single vowel:
* &#x27;the child has gone; &#x27;the children have gone&#x27;

====Possessive concord====
The concords (derived from ) and are also found in the word &#x27;of&#x27;:
* &#x27;Mphatso&#x27;s child&#x27;; &#x27;Mphatso&#x27;s children&#x27;

The same concords are used in possessive adjectives &#x27;my&#x27;, &#x27;your&#x27;, &#x27;his/her/its/their&#x27;, &#x27;our&#x27;, &#x27;your (plural or respectful singular), &#x27;their&#x27;/&#x27;his/her&#x27; (respectful):
* &#x27;my child&#x27;; &#x27;my children&#x27;

 &#x27;their&#x27; is used only of people ( is used for things).

 &#x27;of&#x27; can be combined with nouns or adverbs to make adjectives:
* &#x27;an intelligent child&#x27;; &#x27;intelligent children&#x27;
* a good child&#x27;; &#x27;good children&#x27;

In the same way &#x27;of&#x27; combines with the of the infinitive to make verbal adjectives. + usually shortens to , except where the verb root is monosyllabic:
* &#x27;a beautiful child&#x27;; &#x27;beautiful children&#x27;
* &#x27;a thieving child&#x27;; &#x27;thieving children&#x27;

==== &#x27;other&#x27; and &#x27;real&#x27;====
The same and concords are found with the words &#x27;other&#x27; and &#x27;real&#x27;. In combination with these words the plural concord is converted to :
* &#x27;a certain child, another child&#x27;; &#x27;certain children, other children&#x27;
* &#x27;a real child&#x27;; &#x27;real children&#x27;

====Double-prefix adjectives====
Certain adjectives ( &#x27;big&#x27;, &#x27;small&#x27;; &#x27;male&#x27;, &#x27;female&#x27;; &#x27;long&#x27;, &#x27;tall&#x27;, &#x27;short&#x27;; &#x27;fresh&#x27;) have a double prefix, combining the possessive concord () and the number concord ( or ):
* &#x27;a big child&#x27;; &#x27;big children&#x27;
* &#x27;a small child&#x27;; &#x27;little children&#x27;
* &#x27;a male child&#x27;; &#x27;male children&#x27;
* &#x27;a female child&#x27;; &#x27;female children&#x27;

===Historic changes===
Early dictionaries, such as those of Rebmann, and of Scott and Hetherwick, show that formerly the number of concords was greater. The following changes have taken place:
*Class 2 formerly had the concord (e.g. &#x27;these people&#x27;), but this has now become for most speakers.
*Class 8, formerly using (Southern Region) or (Central Region) (e.g. &#x27;two years&#x27;), has now adopted the concords of class 10.
*Class 6, formerly with concords (e.g. &#x27;these eggs&#x27;), now has the concords of class 2.
*Class 11 () had already been assimilated to class 5 even in the 19th century, although it still exists in some dialects of the neighbouring language Tumbuka. 
*Class 14, formerly with concords (e.g. &#x27;my flour&#x27;), now has the same concords as class 3.
*Class 13 () had in Rebmann&#x27;s time (e.g. &#x27;these small knives&#x27;). This prefix still survives in words like &#x27;sleep&#x27;.

In addition, classes 4 and 9, and classes 15 and 17 have identical concords, so the total number of concord sets (singular and plural) is now twelve.

==Verbs==
===Formation of tenses===
Tenses in Chichewa are differentiated in two ways, by their tense-marker (or tense-infix), and by their tonal pattern. Sometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and differ in their tonal pattern alone. In the following examples, the tense-marker is underlined:
* &#x27;I am buying&#x27;
* &#x27;I usually buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I was buying&#x27;, &#x27;I used to buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I will buy (tomorrow or in future)&#x27;
* &#x27;I will buy (when I get there)&#x27;

One tense has no tense-marker:
* &#x27;I will buy (soon)&#x27;

Tenses can be modified further by adding certain other infixes, called &#x27;aspect-markers&#x27;, after the tense-marker. These are &#x27;always, usually&#x27; &#x27;go and&#x27;, &#x27;come and&#x27; or &#x27;in future&#x27;, and &#x27;only&#x27;, &#x27;just&#x27;. These infixes can also be used on their own, as tense-markers in their own right (compare the use of and in the list of tenses above). For example:
* &#x27;I am always buying&#x27;
* &#x27;I went and bought&#x27;
* &#x27;I just usually buy&#x27;

Compound tenses, such as the following, are also found in Chichewa:
* &#x27;I have been buying&#x27;

===Subject-marker===
Chichewa verbs (with the exception of the imperative mood and infinitive) begin with a prefix agreeing grammatically with the subject. This prefix is referred to by some grammarians as the &#x27;subject-marker&#x27;.
* &#x27;we are going&#x27;
* (for *) &#x27;the tree has fallen&#x27;

The subject-marker can be:
*Personal: &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;you (singular)&#x27;, &#x27;he, she&#x27;, &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;you (plural or polite)&#x27;, &#x27;they&#x27;; &#x27;he/she (respectful or polite). (In the perfect tense, the subject-marker for &#x27;he, she&#x27; is : &#x27;he has gone&#x27;.)
*Impersonal: (class 1, 2 or 6), (class 3 or 14), (class 4 or 9), (class 5), etc.
*Locative: , , 

An example of a locative subject-marker is:
* &#x27;in the water there are fish&#x27;

Both the 2nd and the 3rd person plural pronouns and subject-markers are used respectfully to refer to a single person:
* &#x27;you are going&#x27; (plural or respectful)
* &#x27;they have gone&#x27; or &#x27;he/she has gone&#x27; (respectful)

Except in the perfect tense, the 3rd person subject marker when used of people is the same whether singular or plural. So in the present tense the 3rd person subject-marker is &quot;a-&quot;:
* &#x27;he/she is going&#x27;
* &#x27;they are going&#x27;, &#x27;he/she is going&#x27; (respectful)

But in the perfect tense &quot;wa-&quot; (singular) contrasts with &quot;a-&quot; (plural or respectful):
* &#x27;he/she has gone&#x27;
* &#x27;they have gone&#x27;, &#x27;he/she has gone&#x27; (respectful)

When the subject is a noun not in class 1, the appropriate class prefix is used even if referring to a person:
* &#x27;the chief is going&#x27; (class 9)
* &#x27;the babies are going&#x27; (class 13)

===Object-marker===
An object-marker can also optionally be added to the verb; if one is added it goes immediately before the verb-stem. The 2nd person plural adds after the verb:
* &#x27;I love you&#x27; ( = &#x27;I&#x27;, = &#x27;you&#x27;)
* &#x27;I love you&#x27; (plural or formal)

The object-marker can be:
*Personal: &#x27;me&#x27;, &#x27;you&#x27;, or &#x27;him, her&#x27;, &#x27;us&#x27;, or &#x27;them&#x27;, &#x27;him/her (polite)&#x27;.
*Impersonal: (class 1), (class 2), (class 3 or 14), etc.
*Locative: e.g. &#x27;you know the inside of the house&#x27;; but usually a locative suffix is used instead: &#x27;I have seen inside it&#x27;
*Reflexive: &#x27;himself&#x27;, &#x27;herself&#x27;, &#x27;themselves&#x27;, &#x27;myself&#x27;, etc.

When used with a toneless verb tense such as the perfect, the object-marker has a high tone, but in some tenses such as the present habitual, the tone is lost:
* &#x27;I have seen him&#x27;
* &#x27;I usually see him&#x27;

With the imperative or subjunctive, the tone of the object-marker goes on the syllable following it, and the imperative ending changes to &quot;-e&quot;:
* &#x27;could you give me some rice?&#x27;
* &#x27;help me!&#x27;
* &#x27;you should help him&#x27;

===Variety of tenses===

Chewa has a large number of tenses, some of which differ in some respects from the tenses met with in European languages. The distinction between one tense and another is made partly by the use of infixes, such as and , and partly by the intonation of the verb, since each tense has its own particular tonal pattern.

====Near vs. remote====
There are five time-frames (remote past, near past, present, near future, and remote future). The distinction between near and remote tenses is not exact. The remote tenses are not used of events of today or last night, but the near tenses can sometimes be used of events of earlier or later than today:
* &#x27;I bought (yesterday or some days ago)&#x27; (&quot;remote perfect&quot;)
* &#x27;I have bought (today)&#x27; (&quot;perfect&quot;)
* &#x27;I am buying (now)&#x27; (&quot;present&quot;)
* &#x27;I&#x27;ll buy (today)&#x27; (&quot;near future&quot;)
* &#x27;I&#x27;ll buy (tomorrow or later)&#x27; (&quot;remote future&quot;)

====Perfect vs. past====
Another distinction is between perfect and past. The two perfect tenses imply that the event described had an outcome which still obtains now. The two past tenses usually imply that the result of the action has been reversed in some way:

Recent time (today):

* &#x27;I have bought it&#x27; (and still have it) (&quot;Perfect&quot;)
* &#x27;I bought it (but no longer have it)&#x27; (&quot;Recent Past&quot;)

Remote time (yesterday or earlier):

* or &#x27;I bought it&#x27; (and still have it) (&quot;Remote Perfect&quot;)
* or &#x27;I bought it (but no longer have it)&#x27; (&quot;Remote Past&quot;)

When used in narrating a series of events, however, these implications are somewhat relaxed: the Remote Perfect is used for narrating earlier events, and the Recent Past for narrating events of today.

====Perfective vs. imperfective====
Another important distinction in Chewa is between perfective and imperfective aspect. Imperfective tenses are used for situations, events which occur regularly, or events which are temporarily in progress:

* &#x27;I used to buy&#x27;, &#x27;I was buying (a long time ago)&#x27;
* &#x27;I was buying (today)&#x27;, &#x27;I used to buy (a long time ago)&#x27;
* &#x27;I will be buying (regularly)&#x27;

In the present tense only, there is a further distinction between habitual and progressive:

* &#x27;I buy (regularly)&#x27;
* &#x27;I am buying (currently)&#x27;

====Other tenses====
One future tense not found in European languages is the future, which &#x27;might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause&#x27;:

* &#x27;I will buy&#x27; (if I go there, or when I get there)

There are also various subjunctive and potential mood tenses, such as:

* &#x27;I should buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I should be buying&#x27;
* &#x27;I should buy (in future)&#x27;
* &#x27;I can buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I would have bought&#x27;

===Negative tenses===
Negative tenses, if they are main verbs, are made with the prefix . They differ in intonation from the positive tenses. The negative of the tense has the ending instead of :
* &#x27;I don&#x27;t buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I didn&#x27;t buy&#x27;

Tenses which mean &#x27;will not&#x27; or &#x27;have not yet&#x27; have a single tone on the penultimate syllable:
* &#x27;I won&#x27;t buy&#x27;
* &#x27;I haven&#x27;t bought (it) yet&#x27;

Infinitives, participial verbs, and the subjunctive make their negative with , which is added after the subject-prefix instead of before it. They similarly have a single tone on the penultimate syllable:
* &#x27;I should not buy&#x27;
* &#x27;not to buy&#x27;

===Dependent clause tenses===
The tenses used in certain kinds of dependent clauses (such as relative clauses and some types of temporal clauses) differ from those used in main clauses. Dependent verbs often have a tone on the first syllable. Sometimes this change of tone alone is sufficient to show that the verb is being used in a dependent clause. Compare for example:
* &#x27;he is buying&#x27;
* &#x27;when he is buying&#x27; or &#x27;who is buying&#x27;

Other commonly used dependent tenses are the following:
* &#x27;after I bought/buy&#x27;
* &#x27;before I bought/buy&#x27;

There is also a series of tenses using a toneless meaning &#x27;when&#x27; of &#x27;if&#x27;, for example:
* &#x27;when/if I buy&#x27;
* &#x27;if in future I buy&#x27;
* &#x27;whenever I buy&#x27;
* &#x27;if I had bought&#x27;

===Verb extensions===
After the verb stem one or more extensions may be added. The extensions modify the meaning of the verb, for example:
* &#x27;buy&#x27;
* &#x27;buy for&#x27; or &#x27;buy with&#x27; (&quot;applicative&quot;)
* &#x27;buy for one another&#x27; (&quot;applicative + reciprocal&quot;)
* &#x27;get bought&#x27;, &#x27;be for sale&#x27; (&quot;stative&quot;)
* &#x27;cause to get bought, i.e. sell&#x27; (&quot;causative&quot;)
* &#x27;be sold (by someone)&#x27; (&quot;causative + passive&quot;)

The extensions and its intransitive form are called &#x27;reversive&#x27;. They give meanings such as &#x27;open&#x27;, &#x27;undo&#x27;, &#x27;unstick&#x27;, &#x27;uncover&#x27;:
* &#x27;open (something)&#x27;
* &#x27;become open&#x27;
* &#x27;break something off&#x27;
* &#x27;get broken off&#x27;
* &#x27;undo, loosen&#x27;
* &#x27;become loose, relaxed&#x27;

Most extensions, apart from the reciprocal &#x27;one another&#x27;, have two possible forms, e.g. , , , , , . The forms with and are used when the verb stem has , , or . &quot;u&quot; can also follow &quot;e&quot;:
* &#x27;fail to happen&#x27;
* &#x27;cook for someone&#x27;
* &#x27;sell&#x27;
* &#x27;melt (transitive)&#x27;
* &#x27;open&#x27;

The forms with are used if the verb stem is monosyllabic or has an or in it:
* &#x27;eat with&#x27;
* &#x27;repeat&#x27;
* &#x27;come from&#x27;

Extensions with &quot;o&quot; are used only with a monosyllabic stem or one with &quot;o&quot;:
* &#x27;get broken off&#x27; 
* &#x27;remove grains of corn from the cob&#x27;

The extension with a low tone is causative, but when it has a high tone it is intensive. The high tone is heard on the final syllable of the verb:
* &#x27;look carefully&#x27;
* &#x27;try hard&#x27;

The applicative can also sometimes be intensive, in which case it has a high tone:
* &#x27;carry on, keep going&#x27;

Verbs with when they have a stative or intransitive meaning also usually have a high tone:
* &#x27;happen&#x27;
* &#x27;melt (intransitive), get melted&#x27;

However, there are some low-toned exceptions such as &#x27;seem&#x27; or &#x27;set off&#x27;.

==Oral literature==
In 1907, Robert Sutherland Rattray, who learned the Chinyanja language with the help of Alexander Hetherwick (author of &quot;A Practical Manual of the Nyanja language&quot;), published &quot;Some Folklore Stories and Songs in Chinyanja&quot;, a collection of texts in the Chinyanja language, accompanied by English translations, reflecting the language heard in what was then Central Angoniland in the British Central Africa Protectorate, now Malawi. 
The texts include cultural and historical narratives, along with folktales, including several stories about &quot;Kamba&quot;, the trickster tortoise, and &quot;Kalulu&quot;, the trickster rabbit (hare). These are some of the riddles:
*&quot;Kantu kosanyamulika &#x27;i? Chitunzilunzi.&quot; &quot;A little thing, yet that cannot be lifted. A shadow.&quot; (#7)
*&quot;Ndamanga nyumba ndi mzati umodzi, n&#x27;chiani? Boa.&quot; &quot;I built a hut with only one post to prop up the roof. What is that? A mushroom.&quot; (#11)
*&quot;Nyumba yopanda komo. Dzira.&quot; &quot;A hut without a doorway. An egg.&quot; (#19)
*&quot;Mtengo adula lero, m&#x27;mawa mwache yuamba kupuka. Tsitsi.&quot; &quot;A tree which you cut down today, and the next it begins to sprout. Hair.&quot; (#23)
*&quot;Kungatarikitsa, lero lomwe ukafika, n&#x27;chiani? Mtima.&quot; &quot;However far away it be, this very day this thing reaches there. Memories.&quot; (#24)
*&quot;Pita uku, nanenso, ndipite uko, tikomane. Mkuzi.&quot; &quot;You go in this direction, I go in that, and we must meet. Belt.&quot; (#25)
At the end of the riddle section, Rattray includes a version of the conundrum about the man who must cross a river with a goat, a leopard, and some maize, a traditional African form of the river-crossing puzzle.

== Town Nyanja (Zambia) ==
An urban variety of Nyanja, sometimes called Town Nyanja, is the lingua franca of the Zambian capital Lusaka and is widely spoken as a second language throughout Zambia. This is a distinctive Nyanja dialect with some features of Nsenga, although the language also incorporates large numbers of English-derived words, as well as showing influence from other Zambian languages such as Bemba. Town Nyanja has no official status, and the presence of large numbers of loanwords and colloquial expressions has given rise to the misconception that it is an unstructured mixture of languages or a form of slang.

The fact that the standard Nyanja used in schools differs dramatically from the variety actually spoken in Lusaka has been identified as a barrier to the acquisition of literacy among Zambian children.

The concords in Town Nyanja differ from those in Chichewa described above. For example, classes 5 and 6 both have the concord &quot;ya-&quot; instead of &quot;la-&quot; and &quot;a-&quot;; class 8 has &quot;va-&quot; instead of &quot;za-&quot;; and 13 has &quot;twa-&quot; instead of &quot;ta-&quot;. In addition, the subject and object marker for &quot;I&quot; is &quot;ni-&quot; rather than &quot;ndi-&quot;, and that for &quot;they&quot; is &quot;βa-&quot; (spelled &quot;ba-&quot;) rather than &quot;a-&quot;.

<doc id="481193" wikidata="Q746474" url="?curid=481193" title="Scholar's mate">
<text>In chess, scholar&#x27;s mate is the checkmate achieved by the following moves, or similar:

:1. 
:2. 
:3. 
:4. 

The same mating pattern may be reached by various move orders. For example, White might play 2.Bc4. In all variations, the basic idea is the same: the queen and bishop combine in a simple , occurring on f7 for White or on f2 for Black.

Scholar&#x27;s mate is sometimes referred to as the four-move checkmate, although there are other ways for checkmate to occur in four moves. 

The name is often considered ironic, because it is used almost exclusively by beginners. Defending against it is very simple, and its failure typically results in the attacking side&#x27;s position becoming heavily crippled.

==History==
Scholar&#x27;s mate was named and described in &quot;The Royall Game of Chesse-Play&quot;, a 1656 text by Francis Beale which adapted the work of the early chess writer Gioachino Greco. The example given above is an adaptation of that reported by Beale.

All of the details are coherent from the modern perspective except for the first moves by each player—if Black&#x27;s pawn advances only one square, this prevents White&#x27;s bishop from supporting the white queen to give mate. Beale&#x27;s text was an early modern account of the rules and tactics of chess, including concepts such as the ability of a pawn to advance two squares on its first move, the &quot;en passant&quot; capture, , and exchanges. However, the document treated a then-exotic subject during the early days of printing; consequently the publisher attached a list of errata at the back, following publication. Thus, the text &quot;one houſe&quot; describing the first move (advancing one square) may have been a mistake.

During the eighth round of the World Rapid Chess Championship 2023, Surya Shekhar Ganguly as white was checkmated in 8 moves by Mukhiddin Madaminov in a Scotch Game that ended in a scholar&#x27;s mate pattern.


==Prevention==
Unlike fool&#x27;s mate, which rarely occurs at any level, games ending in scholar&#x27;s mate are quite common among beginners. It is not difficult to parry, however.

===On move 1===
After 1.e4, Black can play a semi-open defense instead of 1...e5. Openings such as the French Defense (1...e6) or the Scandinavian Defense (1...d5) render the scholar&#x27;s mate unviable, while other openings such as the Sicilian Defense (1...c5) make 2.Bc4 a bad move (1.e4 c5 2.Bc4 e6, intending ...d5, gaining by attacking the c4-bishop and attaining easy ).

===On moves 2 and 3===
Black&#x27;s defense depends on whether White goes for 2. Qh5 (the Danvers Opening) or 2. Bc4 (the Bishop&#x27;s Opening).

====After 2. Qh5====
White does not threaten Qxf7# yet, but does threaten Qxe5+. The cleanest way to defend against this is 2...Nc6, developing a knight and protecting the pawn. (2...d6 is also good.) After 3. Bc4, Black can stop the mate with 3...g6; White can threaten mate again with 4. Qf3, but this can be stopped with 4...Nf6. Black can later fianchetto the f8-bishop (...Bg7).

====After 2. Bc4====
The most popular response to 2. Bc4 is 2...Nf6, the Berlin Defence, which immediately renders the scholar&#x27;s mate non-viable.

In the continuation 2...Bc5 (the Classical Defence) 3. Qh5, Black can defend against both scholar&#x27;s mate and the threatened 4. Qxe5+ with 3...Qe7, intending to gain a tempo later with 4...Nf6. The further continuation 4. Nf3 (threatening Nxe5) Nc6 5. Ng5 g6 (diagram) 6. Qf3? Qxg5 7. Qxf7+ Kd8 leaves White with no checkmate and no good way to defend against both ...Nd4, threatening the c2-pawn, and ...Qf6, exchanging queens.

==In other openings==
Although a quick mate on f7 is almost never seen in play above beginner level, the basic idea underlying it—that f7 and f2, squares defended only by the kings, are weak and therefore good targets for early attack—is the motivating principle behind a number of chess openings. 

*After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 (the Two Knights Defense), White&#x27;s most popular continuation is 4.Ng5, attacking f7, which is awkward for Black to defend. The Fried Liver Attack even involves a sacrifice of the knight on f7. 
*In the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation of the Vienna Game (1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4), threatening checkmate with 4.Qh5 is the only way for White to play for an advantage.
*The Modern Defense, Monkey&#x27;s Bum variation involves White threatening a Scholar&#x27;s mate with an early Qf3.

==Other names==
Among English speakers, the scholar&#x27;s mate is also known as &quot;schoolboy&#x27;s mate&quot; (which in modern English perhaps better connotes the sense of &quot;novice&quot; intended by the word &quot;scholar&#x27;s&quot;) and &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; (German for &quot;lightning war&quot;, meaning a quick victory).

The names of the scholar&#x27;s mate in other languages are as follows:
* in Basque, Catalan, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Esperanto, French, German, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish: &quot;shepherd&#x27;s mate&quot;
* in Czech, Croatian, Danish, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian: &quot;shoemaker&#x27;s mate&quot;
* in Belarusian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Ukrainian: &quot;children&#x27;s mate&quot;
* in Bosnian, Danish, Finnish, Macedonian, Norwegian, Serbian, Swedish: &quot;school mate&quot;
* in Arabic, Greek, Persian: &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s mate&quot; (&quot;plan&quot;, &quot;trap&quot;, &quot;move&quot;)
* in Italian: &quot;barber&#x27;s mate&quot;

<doc id="481206" wikidata="Q5418154" url="?curid=481206" title="Everything to Everyone (album)">
<text>Everything to Everyone (commonly abbreviated E2E) is the sixth full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies. It was released in 2003 and was produced by Ron Aniello. Singles from the album include &quot;Another Postcard&quot;, &quot;Testing 1, 2, 3&quot;, &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Celebrity&quot; and &quot;Maybe Katie&quot;. The content of the album is noted for its increased political commentary over previous albums. This was their last album with Reprise Records (or any major label for that matter) before switching to a more independent label, Desperation Records and subsequently Raisin&#x27; Records.

==Creative process==
After an intensive period of recording and touring from 1995 to 2001, Barenaked Ladies (BNL) entered their first extended hiatus in 2002, lasting until most of 2003. Upon returning to the studio to record &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, the band instituted a new policy of keeping songwriting exclusively within the group. This decision led to increased contributions from Jim Creeggan and Kevin Hearn, resulting in a larger number of tracks, ultimately culminating in a 14-song album with an additional bonus track. The album, recorded in Los Angeles, marked the band&#x27;s first project after launching an online blog, which provided fans with continuous updates and insights into their creative process.

During the latter stages of recording, the band utilized the facility&#x27;s B-studio to produce acoustic versions of the album&#x27;s tracks. Drummer Tyler Stewart improvised a drum kit from unconventional objects, and the band performed acoustic renditions of eleven songs, omitting &quot;Shopping,&quot; &quot;Unfinished,&quot; &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; and the bonus track &quot;Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!&quot; This acoustic session was deemed successful, leading to a similar approach for their subsequent album, &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot; (aka &quot;BLAM&quot;).

The album cover, painted by Canadian artist Chris Woods, features a profile of the band members holding a white flag of surrender. The album title was initially displayed as a sticker on the transparent wrapping to maintain the flag&#x27;s symbolism. The special edition featured the title on a clear plastic sleeve, aligned with the flag&#x27;s waves. The original 60&quot; x 60&quot; oil painting reportedly hangs in Steven Page’s farmhouse studio, Fresh Baked Woods.

Several tracks recorded during these sessions were not included on the final album, including:
* &quot;Statue of Los Angeles&quot; (unreleased) – a Hearn composition later released on his album &quot;The Miracle Mile&quot;.
* &quot;Sign Me Up&quot; (unreleased) – described as a profanity-laden track.
* &quot;Adrift&quot; – re-recorded for &quot;BLAM&quot; and released on &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before&quot;
* &quot;What a Let Down&quot; – re-recorded for &quot;BLAM&quot;
* &quot;I Can, I Will, I Do&quot; – re-recorded for &quot;BLAM&quot;; featured on &quot;iTunes Originals - Barenaked Ladies&quot;; later released on &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before&quot;.
* &quot;Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!&quot; – bonus track on the special edition DVD and the UK single for &quot;Celebrity&quot;; later released on &quot;Stop Us If You&#x27;ve Heard This One Before&quot;

Continuing a tradition from their early albums, the band recorded the song &quot;Sign Me Up&quot; entirely in the nude. &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; was the final BNL album to include a track recorded in this fashion.

==Release==
&quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; was issued in three distinct editions:
# standard 14-track version.
# limited edition featuring three bonus tracks from an acoustic session, identified by a special sticker.
# special edition presented in a threefold digipack with a plastic sleeve, containing the standard CD and a bonus DVD titled &quot;Everything Else.&quot; The DVD included DVD-Audio of the album with the additional track &quot;Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!&quot;, as well as both video and stereo-audio formats of the acoustic session and various studio video clips.

The lead single, &quot;Another Postcard,&quot; was perceived by many fans as an effort by the record label to replicate the success of previous hits &quot;One Week&quot; from &quot;Stunt&quot; and &quot;Pinch Me&quot; from &quot;Maroon&quot;, due to its similar style and rap-based vocals. Despite promotional appearances on major U.S. talk shows, the single did not achieve notable success. The band supported the album with the U.S. Peepshow Tour, which deviated from typical promotional efforts, appearing to cater more to dedicated fans than to a broader audience. &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; debuted in the Top 10 in both Canada and the U.S. but experienced a swift decline on the charts. It became only the band&#x27;s second album, following 1994&#x27;s &quot;Maybe You Should Drive&quot;, to not achieve at least Gold certification in the U.S.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Testing 1,2,3,&quot; was released in early 2004, accompanied by a music video and coinciding with a more conventional arena tour. In Canada, &quot;Maybe Katie&quot; was released as a radio single. However, the album did not experience a significant sales revival.

A third single, &quot;For You,&quot; was released as a CD single featuring both the album version and a live recording from Glasgow, Scotland, but it did not receive a music video and garnered minimal airplay. In the UK, &quot;Celebrity&quot; was issued as a radio and commercial single, but it similarly failed to gain traction.

=== DualDisc version ===
&quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in Boston and Seattle. It contains the standard CD album on one side, and bonus DVD material on the second side. The DualDisc version has not been reissued.

<text>CDMA2000 (also known as C2K or IMT Multi‑Carrier (IMT‑MC)) is a family of 3G mobile technology standards for sending voice, data, and signaling data between mobile phones and cell sites. It is developed by 3GPP2 as a backwards-compatible successor to second-generation cdmaOne (IS-95) set of standards and used especially in North America and South Korea.

CDMA2000 compares to UMTS, a competing set of 3G standards, which is developed by 3GPP and used in Europe, Japan, China, and Singapore.

The name CDMA2000 denotes a family of standards that represent the successive, evolutionary stages of the underlying technology. These are:
*Voice: CDMA2000 1xRTT, 1X Advanced
*Data: CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized): Release 0, Revision A, Revision B, Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB)

All are approved radio interfaces for the ITU&#x27;s IMT-2000. In the United States, &quot;CDMA2000&quot; is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA-USA).

==1X==

CDMA2000 1X (IS-2000), also known as 1x and 1xRTT, is the core CDMA2000 wireless air interface standard. The designation &quot;1x&quot;, meaning &quot;1 times radio transmission technology&quot;, indicates the same radio frequency (RF) bandwidth as IS-95: a duplex pair of 1.25 MHz radio channels. 1xRTT almost doubles the capacity of IS-95 by adding 64 more traffic channels to the forward link, orthogonal to (in quadrature with) the original set of 64. The 1X standard supports packet data speeds of up to 153 kbit/s with real world data transmission averaging 80–100 kbit/s in most commercial applications. IMT-2000 also made changes to the data link layer for greater use of data services, including medium and link access control protocols and quality of service (QoS). The IS-95 data link layer only provided best-effort delivery for data and circuit switched channel for voice (i.e., a voice frame once every 20 ms).

==1xEV-DO==

CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized), often abbreviated as EV-DO or EV, is a telecommunications standard for the wireless transmission of data through radio signals, typically for broadband Internet access. It uses multiplexing techniques including code-division multiple access (CDMA) as well as time-division multiple access to maximize both individual user&#x27;s throughput and the overall system throughput. It is standardized (IS-856) by 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) as part of the CDMA2000 family of standards and has been adopted by many mobile phone service providers around the world – particularly those previously employing CDMA networks.

==1X Advanced==
1X Advanced (Rev.E) is the evolution of CDMA2000 1X. It provides up to four times the capacity and 70% more coverage compared to 1X.

==Networks==

The CDMA Development Group states that, as of April 2014, there are 314 operators in 118 countries offering CDMA2000 1X and/or 1xEV-DO service.

==History==
CDMA2000 technology was developed by Qualcomm in the late 1990s as an enhancement to the CDMA standard.

The intended 4G successor to CDMA2000 was UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband); however, in November 2008, Qualcomm announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring LTE instead.
== Patent licensing ==
In 2007, Qualcomm provided a global patent license for CDMA2000 to the Chinese company Teleepoch.

<text>The Bosnian Church () was an autonomous Christian church in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Historians traditionally connected the church with the Bogomils, although this has been challenged and is now rejected by the majority of scholars. Adherents of the church called themselves simply &quot;Krstjani&quot; (&quot;Christians&quot;) or &quot;Dobri Bošnjani&quot; (&quot;Good Bosnians&quot;). The church&#x27;s organization and beliefs are poorly understood, because few if any records were left by church members and the church is mostly known from the writings of outside sources — primarily Catholic ones.

The monumental tombstones called &quot;stećak&quot; that appeared in medieval Bosnia, as well as Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro, are sometimes identified with the Bosnian Church.

==Background==

===Schism===
Christian missions emanating from Rome and Constantinople started pushing into the Balkans in the 9th century, Christianizing the South Slavs, and establishing boundaries between the ecclesiastical jurisdictions of the See of Rome and the See of Constantinople. The East–West Schism then led to the establishment of Catholicism in Croatia and most of Dalmatia, while Eastern Orthodoxy came to prevail in Serbia. Lying in-between, the mountainous Bosnia was nominally under Rome, but Catholicism never became firmly established due to a weak church organization and poor communications. Medieval Bosnia thus remained a &quot;no-man&#x27;s land between faiths&quot; rather than a meeting ground between the two Churches, leading to a unique religious history and the emergence of an &quot;independent and somewhat heretical church&quot;.

Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy predominated in different parts of what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina; the followers of the former formed a majority in the west, the north, and in the center of Bosnia, while those of the latter were a majority in most of Zachlumia (present-day Herzegovina) and along Bosnia&#x27;s eastern border. This changed in the mid-13th century, when the Bosnian Church began eclipsing the Roman. While Bosnia remained nominally Catholic in the High Middle Ages, the Bishop of Bosnia was a local cleric chosen by Bosnians and then sent to the Archbishop of Ragusa solely for ordination. Although the Papacy already insisted on using Latin as the liturgical language, Bosnian Catholics retained the Church Slavonic language.

===Abjuration and crusade===

Vukan, ruler of Dioclea, wrote to Pope Innocent III in 1199 that Kulin, ruler of Bosnia, had become a heretic, along with his wife, sister, other relatives, and 10,000 other Bosnians. The Archbishop of Spalato, vying for control over Bosnia, joined Vukan and accused the Archbishop of Ragusa of neglecting his suffragan diocese in Bosnia. Emeric, King of Hungary, a supporter of Spalato, also seized this opportunity to try to extend his influence over Bosnia. Further accusations against Kulin, such as harbouring heretics, ensued until 1202. In 1203, Kulin moved to defuse the threat of foreign intervention. A synod was held at his instigation on 6 April. Following the abjuration of Bilino Polje, Kulin succeeded in keeping the Bosnian Diocese under the Ragusan Archdiocese, thus limiting Hungarian influence. The errors abjured by the Bosnians in Bilino Polje seem to have been errors of practice, stemming from ignorance, rather than heretical doctrines.

==History==

The bid to consolidate Catholic rule in Bosnia in the 12th to 13th centuries proved difficult. The Banate of Bosnia held strict trade relations with the Republic of Ragusa, and Bosnia&#x27;s bishop was under the jurisdiction of Ragusa. This was disputed by the Hungarians, who tried to achieve their jurisdiction over Bosnia&#x27;s bishops, but Bosnia&#x27;s first Ban Kulin averted that. In order to conduct a crusade against him, the Hungarians turned to Rome, complaining to Pope Innocent III that the Kingdom of Bosnia was a centre of heresy, based on the refuge that some Cathars (also known as Bogomils or Patarenes) had found there. To avert the Hungarian attack, Ban Kulin held a public assembly on 8 April 1203 and affirmed his loyalty to Rome in the presence of an envoy of the Pope, while the faithful abjured their mistakes and committed to following the Catholic doctrine. Yet, in practice this was ignored. After the death of Kulin in 1204, a mission was sent to convert Bosnia to Rome but failed.

On 15 May 1225, Pope Honorius III spurred the Hungarians to undertake the Bosnian Crusade. That expedition, like the previous ones, turned into a defeat, and the Hungarians had to retreat when the Mongols invaded their territories. In 1234, the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia was removed by Pope Gregory IX for allowing supposedly heretical practices. In addition, Gregory called on the Hungarian king to crusade against the heretics in Bosnia. However, Bosnian nobles were able to expel the Hungarians once again.

In 1252, Pope Innocent IV decided to put Bosnia&#x27;s Bishop under the Hungarian Kalocsa jurisdiction. This decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome. In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which many scholars later saw a Bogomil or Cathar church, whilst more recent scholars such as Noel Malcolm and John Fine maintain that no trace of Bogomilism, Catharism, or other dualism can be found in the original documents of the Bosnian Christians.

It was not until Pope Nicholas&#x27; Bull &quot;Prae Cunctis&quot; in 1291 that the Franciscan-led Inquisition was imposed on Bosnia. Bogomilism was eradicated in Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire in the 13th century, but survived in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in 1463.

The Bosnian Church coexisted with the Catholic Church (and with the few Bogomil groups) for most of the Late Middle Ages, but no accurate figures exist as to the numbers of adherents of the two churches. Several Bosnian rulers were &quot;Krstjani&quot;, while others adhered to Catholicism. Stjepan Kotromanić shortly reconciled Bosnia with Rome, while ensuring at the same time the survival of the Bosnian Church. Notwithstanding the incoming Franciscan missionaries, the Bosnian Church survived, although weaker and weaker, until it disappeared after the Ottoman conquest.

Outsiders accused the Bosnian Church of links to the Bogomils, a stridently dualist sect of Gnostic Christians heavily influenced by the Manichaean Paulician movement. The Bogomil heretics were at one point mainly centered in Bulgaria and are now known by historians as the direct progenitors of the Cathars. The Inquisition reported the existence of a dualist sect in Bosnia in the late 15th century and called them &quot;Bosnian heretics&quot;, but this sect was according to some historians most likely not the same as the Bosnian Church. The historian Franjo Rački wrote about this in 1869 based on Latin sources, but the Croatian scholar Dragutin Kniewald in 1949 established the credibility of the Latin documents in which the Bosnian Church is described as heretical. It is thought today that the Bosnian Church&#x27;s adherents, who were persecuted both by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, predominantly converted to Islam upon the arrival of the Turkish Ottomans, thus adding to the ethnogenesis of the modern-day Bosniaks. According to Bašić, the Bosnian Church was dualist in character, and so was neither a schismatic Catholic nor Orthodox Church. According to Mauro Orbini (d. 1614), the Patarenes and the Manicheans were two Christian religious sects in Bosnia. The Manicheans had a bishop called &quot;djed&quot; and priests called &quot;strojnici&quot; (strojniks), the same titles ascribed to the leaders of the Bosnian Church.

The religious centre of the Bosnian Church was located in Moštre, near Visoko, where the House of Krstjani was founded. Some historians contend that the Bosnian Church had largely disappeared before the Ottoman conquest in 1463. Other historians dispute a discrete terminal point.

==Organization and characteristics==

The Bosnian Church used Slavic language in liturgy.

===Djed===

The church was headed by a bishop, called &quot;djed&quot; (&#x27;grandfather&#x27;), and had a council of twelve men called &quot;strojnici&quot;. The monk missionaries were known as &quot;krstjani&quot; or &quot;kršćani&quot; (&#x27;adherents of the cross&#x27; or &#x27;christians&#x27;). Some of the adherents resided in small monasteries, known as &quot;hiže&quot; (&quot;hiža&quot;, &#x27;house&#x27;), while others were wanderers, known as &quot;gosti&quot; (&quot;gost&quot;, &#x27;guest&#x27;). It is difficult to ascertain how the theology differed from that of the Orthodox and Catholic. The practices were, however, unacceptable to both.

The Church was mainly composed of monks in scattered monastic houses. It had no territorial organization and it did not deal with any secular matters other than attending people&#x27;s burials. It did not involve itself in state issues very much. Notable exceptions were when King Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia, a member of the Bosnian Church himself, had a &quot;djed&quot; as an advisor at the royal court between 1403 and 1405, and an occasional occurrence of a krstjan elder being a mediator or diplomat.

===Hval&#x27;s Codex===

Hval&#x27;s Codex, written in 1404 in Cyrillic, is one of the most famous manuscripts belonging to the Bosnian Church in which there are some iconographic elements which are not in concordance with the supposed theological doctrine of Christians (Annunciation, Crucifixion and Ascension). All the important Bosnian Church books &quot;(Nikoljsko evandjelje, Sreckovicevo evandelje, the Manuscript of Hval, the Manuscript of Krstyanin Radosav)&quot; are based on Glagolitic Church books.

==Studies==
The phenomenon of Bosnian medieval Christians attracted scholars&#x27; attention for centuries, but it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the most important monograph on the subject, &quot;Bogomili i Patareni&quot; (Bogomils and Patarens), 1870, by eminent Croatian historian Franjo Rački, was published. Rački argued that the Bosnian Church was essentially Gnostic and Manichaean in nature. This interpretation has been accepted, expanded and elaborated upon by a host of later historians, most prominent among them being Dominik Mandić, Sima Ćirković, Vladimir Ćorović, Miroslav Brandt, and Franjo Šanjek. However, a number of other historians (Leo Petrović, Jaroslav Šidak, Dragoljub Dragojlović, Dubravko Lovrenović, and Noel Malcolm) stressed the impeccably orthodox theological character of Bosnian Christian writings and claimed the phenomenon can be sufficiently explained by the relative isolation of Bosnian Christianity, which retained many archaic traits predating the East-West Schism in 1054.

Conversely, the American historian of the Balkans, John Fine, does not believe in the dualism of the Bosnian Church at all. Though he represents his theory as a &quot;new interpretation of the Bosnian Church&quot;, his view is very close to J. Šidak&#x27;s early theory and that of several other scholars before him. He believes that while there could have been heretical groups alongside of the Bosnian Church, the church itself was inspired by Papal overreach.

Some Protestants have attempted to look back on the Bosnian church as their forerunner.

<text>Jiu Manzhou Dang (; Manchu: &quot;Fe Manju Dangse&quot;) is a set of Manchu archives stored at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan. It is the sourcebook of &quot;Manwen Laodang&quot; and a primary source of early Manchu history. It is often called &quot;yuandang&quot; (原檔 original archives).

It covers official Manchu documents from the 3rd month of the 35th year of the Wanli Emperor (1607) to the 12th month of the 1st year of Chongde (1636). Archives are mostly written in the script without dots and circles. Although Dahai is said to have invented the script with dots and circles in 1632, subsequent archives occasionally, but not always, add dots and circles. Standard Manchu required time to establish.

&quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot; was discovered in 1931, a month after the discovery of the Beijing edition of &quot;Manwen Laodang&quot;. Three more volumes were found in 1935. It was moved from place to place due to long-running wars and was finally carried to Taiwan by the Kuomintang. The study on original archives was started in 1960s. The National Palace Museum published the copy under the name &quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot; in 1969.

The Qing dynasty emperor Hong Taiji claimed that their progenitor, Bukūri Yongšon, was conceived from a virgin birth. According to the legend, three heavenly maidens, namely Enggulen (恩古倫), Jenggulen (正古倫) and Fekulen (佛庫倫), were bathing at a lake called Bulhūri Omo near the Changbai Mountains. A magpie dropped a piece of red fruit near Fekulen, who ate it. She then became pregnant with Bukūri Yongšon. However, another older version of the story by the Hurha (Hurka) tribe member Muksike recorded in 1635 contradicts Hongtaiji&#x27;s version on location, claiming that it was in Heilongjiang province close to the Amur river where Bulhuri lake was located where the &quot;heavenly maidens&quot; took their bath. This was recorded in the Jiu Manzhou Dang and his much shorter and simpler in addition to being older. This is believed to be the original version and Hongtaiji changed it to Changbai mountain. It shows that the Aisin Gioro clan originated in the Amur area and the Heje (Hezhen) and other Amur valley Jurchen tribes had an oral version of the same tale. It also fits with Jurchen history since some ancestors of the Manchus originated north before the 14th-15th centuries in the Amur and only later moved south.

<text>Mutare, formerly known as Umtali until 1982, is the capital and largest city in the province of Manicaland. It is the third most populated in Zimbabwe. Having surpassed Gweru in the 2012 census, with an urban population of 224,802 and approximately 260,567 in the surrounding districts, Mutare adds to the wider metropolitan area a total population of over 500,000 people. Mutare is also the capital of Manicaland Province and the largest city in eastern Zimbabwe.

Located near the border with Mozambique, Mutare has long been a centre of trade and a key terminus en route to the port of Beira (in Beira, Mozambique). Mutare is hub for trade with railway links, pipeline transport and highways linking the coast with Harare and Zimbabwe&#x27;s interior. Other traditional industries include timber, papermaking, commerce, food processing, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition the city serves as a gateway to the scenic Eastern Highlands, nearby Gorongosa National Park, and the Mozambique coast.

==History==

Although the city was founded in the late nineteenth century, the region has a long history of trading caravans passing through on the way to the Indian Ocean, from ports such as Sofala, to inland settlements, such as Great Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is also renowned for its soapstone carvings and figurines which are evidence of these trade routes, dating as far back as the late African Iron Age (c. 900 AD) right up to the colonial period. A large hoard of soapstone carvings, jewellery, weapons, sherds and other objects were found in the vicinity of Mutare by the British archaeologist E M Andrews at the beginning of the twentieth century - they were later donated by the trustees of Cecil Rhodes to the British Museum in 1905. The soapstone figures, which are both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, might have been part of a votive offering, as they were discovered near what appeared to be an altar.
Mutare was founded in 1897 as a fort, about 8 km from the border with Mozambique, and is just 290 km from the Mozambican port of Beira, earning Mutare the title of &quot;Zimbabwe&#x27;s Gateway to the Sea&quot;. It is sometimes also called &quot;Gateway to the Eastern Highlands&quot;. Many Zimbabwean locals refer to it as &#x27;Kumakomoyo&#x27; (place of many mountains). There is a border railway station on the railway line from Bulawayo to Beira with a railways mechanical workshop.

The area was the site of Chief Mutasa&#x27;s kraal. In 1890 A. R. Coquhoun was given concessionary rights and Fort Umtali (the fort later became Mutare) was established between the Tsambe and Mutare Rivers. The word &quot;mutare&quot; originates from the word &#x27;Utare&#x27; meaning iron (or possibly meaning gold). The name was probably given to the river as a result of gold being discovered in the Penhalonga valley through which the Mutare River runs.

In 1891 the location was moved to a site now known as Old Mutare, about 14 km north of the city centre. In 1896 the construction of the railway between Beira and Bulawayo led to the town being moved a third time so that it was closer to the railway line – compensation was paid by the British South Africa Company to the townspeople for the cost of moving. The town was proclaimed a municipality on 11 June 1914 and in 1971 it was granted city status. The name was officially changed from Umtali to Mutare in 1982.

The white population in Umtali dropped from 9,950 in 1969 to 8,600 in June 1978.

The city had a tramway from January 26, 1897, to May 23, 1921, which transported passengers from the Railway station up to the (then Umtali Club) now Mutare Club. The Tramway was at the centre of Main Street where the palm trees now stand.

There were plans to set up a Stock Exchange in Umtali. The main post office was at the site where CABS centre now stands.

==Geography==
The town lies north of the Bvumba Mountains and south of the Imbeza Valley. Christmas Pass is a mountain pass that leads into the city from the west. The pass was so named by some of the colonial pioneers who camped at the foot of the pass on Christmas Day 1890.

Mutare is home to several tourist attractions such as, the Mutare Museum, the Utopia House Museum dedicated to Kingsley Fairbridge, the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, Murahwa Hill, known for its rock paintings and Iron Age village, Cross Kopje with a memorial to Zimbabweans and Mozambicans killed in World War I and a nature reserve Cecil Kopje and Tigers Kloof. The Mutare Boys&#x27; High Chapel was constructed in honour of former Old boys who perished in World War II, situated on a hilly knoll at Mutare Boys High (then Umtali Boys High).

Mutare is served by rail with daily passenger and freight links to Nyazura, Rusape and Harare.

There are three small aerodromes; the smallest is at Mutare Provincial Hospital, a very small light aircraft strip for emergency evacuation (now defunct), a light plane aerodrome in Sakubva near Mutare Teachers College, and the Grand Reef Airport just outside the city at Irene. There is yet a fourth airport which was constructed in Chiadzwa to carry diamonds for processing in Harare.

===Climate===
Despite its subtropical location, the city has a humid subtropical climate, of the highland variety moderated by its altitude. Mutare experience drizzle almost throughout the year. The average annual temperature is 19 °C, surprisingly low for its moderate altitude (about the same as Harare which is 360 metres higher.) This is due to its sheltered position against the mountain ridge of Cecil Kop which encourages cool breezes from lower altitude to the east and south. The coldest month is July (minimum 6 °C and maximum 20 °C) and the hottest month is October (minimum 16 °C and maximum 32 °C). The annual rainfall is 818 mm. Rain falls mostly in the months December to February although heavy showers are possible before and after this period. The wettest month on record was January 1926 which received 580 mm while January 1991 received only 24 mm.

The city&#x27;s climate is also influenced by its proximity to the ocean, compared to other Zimbabwean cities. This leads to warm to hot summers and mild winters. Winter is not particularly frosty with cool mornings often followed by mild sunny weather. Spring can feature &quot;four seasons in a day&quot; weather, but from March to June it is generally settled and mild. Temperatures during summer can reach 30 °C (86 °F). Due to its maritime influence, Mutare&#x27;s temperate climate stands out considering its latitude. Prevailing winds in the city are mainly a cool, moist southeasterly and during late spring and winter alternating with subtropical winds from the north in summer.

==Demographics==

In 1965, Mutare had a population of 46,000. The racial makeup was split between 36,100 black Africans, 560 Asians, 340 Coloureds, and 9,100 whites.

The population is predominantly Shona, the majority of them speaking the Manyika dialect. Manyika people are locally known as Samanyika. According to the 2012 census data, Mutare has a population of 260,567. This marks a rapid increase from a population of 69,621 in 1982 and 131,367 in 1992.

==Cityscape==


Mutare, like most cities in Zimbabwe, classifies residential suburbs according to population density: Low density, Medium density and High density. In the past, as was done across Southern Africa during the colonial period, people were segregated to suburbs according to their racial ethnicity. Whites inhabited the Eastern upmarket suburbs the low-density suburbs, with Coloured people (mixed race) living in suburbs like Florida and black Africans being segregated to the townships of Sakubva and Dangamvura.

The most upscale suburbs (low-density suburbs) such as Murambi, Fairbridge Park, Morningside, Tiger&#x27;s Kloof and the Avenues are located on the north and east ends of the city. The suburb of Avenues is found just east of the city centre on the way to Tiger&#x27;s Kloof and Murambi, bordering Morningside.

East of the CBD is the suburbs of Palmerstone, Darlington, Greenside and Bordervale, which are all near the border with Mozambique.

In the west are the medium-density (i.e. middle class) suburbs, the largest and most famous being Yeovil - (the majority of street names in Yeovil are named after English counties e.g. Sussex Gardens, Hampshire, Devonshire, Somerset). Then more recently developed after Yeovil is Westlea (the majority all streets in Westlea are named after Australasian cities, (e.g. Canberra, Auckland, Sydney, Perth and Christchurch) and Florida (the streets in Florida have English Kings&#x27; names, e.g. Henry, Alfred, Richard, George), as well as the high-density suburb of Chikanga, which was constructed in phases, beginning in the late eighties.

Further west of Chikanga lies Garikai, Bernwin and Hobhouse. South of the railway tracks, is the working class suburb of Sakubva, which contains nearly half of the city&#x27;s population despite an area of less than four square miles. Sakubva is considered to be the poorest of Mutare&#x27;s suburbs, and its economy is centred around a large outdoor food and flea market and the &quot;Musika weHuku&quot; (The Chicken Market). The market has been recently razed in the recent exercise to clean up the city and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and moved elsewhere.

South of the city, hidden from view from the rest of the city by a series of hills, is the high-density suburb of Dangamvura. The affluent areas of Weirmouth (Plots) and Fern Valley are also on the southern outskirts of the city; in these areas, residential lots exceed an acre, and market gardening is an economic activity. Nearby Fern Valley, is home to the new state university, the Manicaland College of Applied Sciences.

To the south east, in the mountains from the Prince of Wales viewpoint (with views of Mozambique below), lies the scenic Vumba Mountain range, an area of immense great natural beauty and temperate climate, and home to an indigenous afromontane forests, exotic trees, such as pine and oak and the upscale, Leopard Rock Hotel, as well as resort areas for horse riding, kayaking, mountain climbing mountain trails, a food processing plant and large plantations of pine and wattle forests.

Further south along the road to Masvingo, beyond the city limits is the high-density town of Zimunya. Mutare&#x27;s main industrial areas lie south of the railway and west of Sakubva, although there is some light industry just east of the southern part of the city centre at &quot;Greenmarket&quot; and surrounding areas.

These are some of the major suburbs of Mutare.

== Infrastructure ==

The city has one of the most important railway stations on the Beira–Bulawayo railway.

Mutare is generally a clean town with the city council collecting rubbish daily. Most of the roads in the older parts of the city are paved (or were paved before), however, due to years of neglect and mismanagement and corruption, public infrastructure is in a shambles with roads and street lighting in a critical state.

There is a main park in the city just before the cricket grounds that is also underutilised and not in good shape. A game park called the Cecil Kop is located in Tigers Kloof and also lacks proper management.

Most of the buildings in the city are low-rise buildings with the tallest being 8 floors high. The city has a pleasant ambience. There are generally no sidewalks on all roads outside the city centre and the downtown area seems more dilapidated and neglected. The post-independent city council does not seem to have strict building codes for new office and commercial buildings in the city centre which would allow for the expansion of high and modern architecture for a growing city that aims to match global standards.

Mutareans, like most of Zimbabweans, prefer to live in houses made of brick, usually brick under tile or asbestos. There are no shanty towns, shacks or squatter camps in Mutare as they are illegal and residents could face penalties or demolition for not building houses to code. As the city expands and develops, the town planners have not considered playgrounds for children, street naming, pedestrian pavements, cycle tracks, proper drainage and flora (tree-lined streets) in their planning of new suburbs generally resulting in unpleasant-looking narrow neighbourhood streets.

There have been problems with wastewater treatment, meaning that at times untreated wastewater runs into the river in Sakubva township.

There are clinics in all suburbs as well as a main general hospital and infectious diseases hospital. Maternity hospitals are also available in the city.

The city generally has very good infrastructure that may need a bit of working on.

===Transportation===
Mutare is well-connected by several roads which are asphalted and decent, but potholes are increasingly common. The A3 motorway leads inland towards Harare and also passes through Rusape and Marondera, while the A9 turns southward into the southern Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani. To the east is EN9 which connects Mutare to Chimoio and with the coastal city of Beira. Traffic is often heavy since this is one of Zimbabwe&#x27;s main routes to the sea. There is also a lot of cross-border traffic with people visiting the nearby cities of Manica and Chimoio.

Commuter buses are a popular way of travelling for traffic across the border and from outlying villages. Higher quality intercity buses are also available to both Harare and Beira, Mozambique.

Mutare is served by a small airport that is largely geared toward small aircraft and chartered flights. The nearest international gateway is in, Harare some 214 km (133 mi) west.there is the Aerodrome close to sakubva and the Grand Reef Airport in Irene just a short distance outside the city.

The National Railways of Zimbabwe serves Mutare with overnight train service from Harare three times a week, leaving Harare at 9:30PM on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, arriving early the next morning at dawn. There are no cross-border rail services from Mozambique, which are limited to freight. The Mutare railway station is just southwest of the city centre.

==Economy==
The main activities of the area are farming farming- forestry, dairy, horticulture, mining, manufacturing, services - the city&#x27;s name Mutare is derived from &quot;metal&quot; Utare possibly gold which used to be smelted by the indigenous population for centuries - and forestry. Two of the largest food producers in Zimbabwe, Cairns Foods and Tanganda Tea, operate in Mutare.

Mining includes gold at Redwing Mine, Penhalonga and some smaller mines, diamonds in Marange and gravel quarries around the city. There are a number of forestry companies including The Wattle Company, Allied Timbers, formerly FCZ, Border Timbers and Timcon Investments. The main timber products include rough sawn timber, wattle bark, charcoal, various doors and frames and mouldings. The major timber produced is pine, sydney blue gum, black wattle, and some hardwoods on a smaller scale.
The railway is linked to Mocambique and is Zimbabwes gateway to the sea. The rail system however requires revamping and also including flyovers tunnels and or underpasses to avoid interaction with road traffic.
Mutare has numerous hotels including Holiday Inn, Golden Peacock, Mountview, Eastgate and numerous lodges.
There are a number of new manufacturing companies such as Willowton which manufactures edible oils, margari 
Mutare has a vehicle assembly Quest which assembles Buses Trucks and other vehicles.

There are also numerous retail outlets, stationery shops, fuel service stations, computer equipment sellers e.g. EMachines, Mutare Computers.
There are a number of freight companies e.g. Tinmac, EMaster, Mantray, Augastalane Freight, Madziro, Tisu Anhu Acho among others
Banks in Mutare include Stanbic Bank a member of Standard Bank group, CBZ, Nedbank, MBCA, Agribank, POSB, Cabs, Ecobank, BancABC, FBC, First Capital formerly Barclays. Standard Chartered has closed shop in Mutare 
Civic Center is the Mutare city council headquarters. It issues licenses e.g. shop licences, parking licenses, dog licensing, housing, industry planning certification online and other local authority by law certifications.
Mutare has a small aerodrome that services small aircraft, helicopters. The city is in dire need of a proper airport for meaningful tourism to occur. There is also need for improved road networks, shopping mall/s and improved social amenities.

<text>Manwen Laodang () is a set of Manchu official documents of the Qing dynasty, compiled during the late Qianlong period based on &quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot;.

==Two editions==
It was difficult to understand Old Manchu, written in the script without dots and circles, in the Qianlong period. Translation of old archives into Standard Manchu was started in 1775. Two versions, namely the Beijing edition and the Mukden edition, were created. Both editions slept deep inside the palaces.

Each edition contains both &quot;tongki fuka sindaha hergen i dangse&quot; (archives in the script with dots and circles) and &quot;tongki fuka akū hergen i dangse&quot; (archives in the script without dots and circles). The former is written in Standard Manchu. The Beijing edition gives commentaries to arcane passages and Manchu translations to Mongolian texts. The latter is basically written in Old Manchu. Note that it is not identical with &quot;Jiu Manzhou Dang&quot; since duplications of original archives were eliminated from &quot;Manwen Laodang&quot;. Some old archives written in Standard Manchu are reduced to Old Manchu but the rest is kept in the original language.

==Discovery==
The Mukden edition was discovered by the Japanese historian Naito Torajiro in 1905 and he named it &quot;Manwen Laodang&quot; (Mambun Rōtō). He filmed the archives in the script with dots and circles in 1912 and brought them to Japan. The Beijing edition was discovered in 1931.</text><links>

<text>Three Soldiers (also titled Three Servicemen) is a bronze statue by Frederick Hart. Unveiled on Veterans Day, November 11, 1984, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., it is part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial commemorating the Vietnam War. It was the first representation of an African American on the National Mall.

== History ==

===Creation and installation===
Negative reactions to Maya Lin&#x27;s design for the Memorial wall were so strong that several Congressmen complained, and Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt refused to issue a building permit. As the most highly ranked sculptor in the competition, Frederick Hart was commissioned to create a sculpture to appease those who wanted a more traditional approach.

In an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vietnam veteran Tom Carhart argued that without a heroic sculptural element, the abstract design would put too much emphasis on the &quot;shame and sorrow&quot; of the Vietnam War. Lin was furious at the adulteration of her design and called the decision to add Hart&#x27;s piece &quot;a coup&quot; which &quot;had nothing to do with how many veterans liked or disliked my piece.&quot; Lin stated that she had not received a single adverse letter from a veteran, adding that &quot;most of them are not as conservative as Carhart.&quot; Hart&#x27;s addition was placed a distance away from the memorial wall to minimize the effect on her design.

These conflicting expectations made for a challenging project. As Hart saw it, his task was &quot;to preserve and enhance the elegant simplicity and austerity of the existing design&quot; and &quot;to create a sculpture which is in itself a moving evocation of the experience and service of the Vietnam Veteran.&quot;

===Design and symbolism===
To portray the major ethnic groups that were represented in the ranks of U.S. combat personnel that served in Vietnam, the statue&#x27;s three men are purposely identifiable as Latino American (left), European American (center), and African American (right). These three figures were based on seven actual young men, of which two (the Caucasian-American and the African-American) were active-duty Marines when the sculpture was commissioned. The Caucasian figure was modeled after James E. Connell III, then a Corporal in the Marines; the African-American figure was modeled after three men, Marine Corporal Terrance Green, Rodney Sherrill, and Scotty Dillingham; the Hispanic figure was modeled after Guillermo (Willie) Smith De Perez DeLeon and Rene Farkass.
Made using the lost wax technique, the sculpture was Hart&#x27;s first major work in bronze.

==Concept==
Of the memorial, the sculptor Hart has suggested,

I see the wall as a kind of ocean, a sea of sacrifice that is overwhelming and nearly incomprehensible in the sweep of names. I place these figures upon the shore of that sea, gazing upon it, standing vigil before it, reflecting the human face of it, the human heart.

The portrayal of the figures is consistent with history. They wear the uniform and carry the equipment of war; they are young. The contrast between the innocence of their youth and the weapons of war underscores the poignancy of their sacrifice. There is about them the physical contact and sense of unity that bespeaks the bonds of love and sacrifice that is the nature of men at war. And yet they are each alone. Their strength and their vulnerability are both evident. Their true heroism lies in these bonds of loyalty in the face of their awareness and their vulnerability.
The statue and the Wall appear to interact, with the soldiers looking on in solemn tribute at the names of their fallen comrades. Noted sculptor Jay Hall Carpenter, Hart&#x27;s assistant on the project, explains the sculpture was positioned especially for that effect: &quot;We carried a full-size mockup of the soldiers around the memorial site trying many locations until we hit upon the perfect spot. It was here that the sculpture appeared to be looking over a sea of the fallen.&quot;

Of his work on &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, Hart said he would put the &quot;folds of those fatigue jackets and pants up against the folds of any [carved] medieval angel you can find.&quot;

==Merchandise==

The design of &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; was copyrighted by Hart and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Reproductions were sold on many pieces of memorabilia, including t-shirts, keychains, and snowglobes. Hart donated his share of the profits to a non-profit that provides name rubbings to families of veterans.

==Replica==
A partial replica of the sculpture was created and dedicated on July 12, 2008, in Apalachicola, Florida.

<text>The Convergent Technologies Operating System, also known variously as CTOS, BTOS and STARSYS, is a discontinued modular, message-passing, multiprocess-based operating system.

==Overview==
CTOS had many innovative features for its time. System access was controlled with a user password and Volume or disk passwords. If one knew the password, for example, for a volume, one could access any file or directory on that volume (hard disk). Each volume and directory were referenced with delimiters to identify them, and could be followed with a file name, depending on the operation, i.e. {Network Node}[VolumeName]&lt;DirectoryName&gt;FileName.

It was possible to custom-link the operating system to add or delete features.

CTOS supported a transparent peer-to-peer network carried over serial RS-422 cables (daisy-chain topology) and in later versions carried over twisted pair (star topology) with RS-422 adapters using CTOS Cluster Hub-R12 designed by Paul Jackson Ph.D. of SumNet Pty Limited in Australia. Each workgroup (called a &quot;cluster&quot;) was connected to a server (called a &quot;master&quot;). The workstations, normally diskless, were booted over the cluster network from the master, and could optionally be locally booted from attached hard drives.

The Inter-process communication (IPC) is primarily based on the &quot;request&quot; and &quot;respond&quot; messaging foundation that enhanced the Enterprise Application Integration among services for both internal and external environments. Thus CTOS was well known for the message-based Microkernel Architecture. Applications are added as services to the main server. Each client consumes the services via its own mailbox called &quot;exchange&quot; and well-published message formats. The communication works on &quot;request codes&quot; that are owned by the service. The operating system maintains the exchanges, message queues, scheduling, control, message passing, etc., while the service manages the messages at its own exchange using &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;check&quot;, and &quot;respond&quot; macros.

CTOS ran on Intel x86 computers, and could run concurrently with Windows NT on Unisys PC.

The system API was presented to both high-level languages and assembly language.

==Programs==
The assembler was very advanced, with a Lisp-like pattern-matching macro facility unmatched by almost any other assembler before or since. There was an always-resident debugger.

Most of the system programs were written in PL/M, an ALGOL-like language from Intel which compiled directly to object code without a runtime library.

The word processor was one of the first screen-oriented editors with many high-powered features, such as multiple views of the same file, cut/copy/paste, unlimited undo/redo, no typing lost after a crash or power failure, user-selectable fonts, and much more.

The spreadsheet allowed blocks of cells to be protected from editing or other user input. The BTOS version allowed scripts to be written that included opening the spreadsheet for user input, then automatically printing graphs based on the input data.

The system shell was extensible, making it possible to define new commands. To get the parameters, the system would display the form which was to be filled out by the user. The input form had conventions for mandatory and optional input fields, which made it very easy to train new users.UNSAFE system was initially put to the public to harm safety of info

==Usage==
Convergent Technologies&#x27; first product was the IWS (Integrated Workstation) based on the Intel 8086 processor, which had CTOS as its operating system. This was a modular operating system with built-in local area networking. CTOS supported multiple processes or threads, and message-based interprocess communication.

Companies that licensed CTOS included Bull (STARSYS), and Burroughs (BTOS) who later merged with Sperry to become Unisys. Unisys was the single largest customer and acquired Convergent Technologies in 1988. At its peak, CTOS had over 800,000 users worldwide.

CTOS is no longer marketed to new customers. Former major customers included police forces, banks, airlines, Nationwide Insurance, U-Haul, the U.S. Postal Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Army and the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard used the operating system from approximately 1984 until 2000. In Australia, CTOS/BTOS was used by the Trade Practices Commission, NSW Auditor-General&#x27;s, CSIRO, Commonwealth Electoral Office, Western Australia Prisons Department and many commercial banks.

Some Convergent systems used the Intel 80186 processor, a processor seldom used by standard PCs.

Progress Software Corporation made a commercial database application for CTOS that was in 4GL. The United States Coast Guard used these databases for logistics administration for their vessels.

There was a port of CorelDRAW for CTOS running the Presentation Manager.

<text>is a book of observations and musings recorded by Sei Shōnagon during her time as court lady to Empress Consort Teishi during the 990s and early 1000s in Heian-period Japan. The book was completed in the year 1002.

The work is a collection of essays, anecdotes, poems, and descriptive passages which have little connection to one another except for the fact they are ideas and whims of Shōnagon&#x27;s spurred by moments in her daily life. In it she included lists of all kinds, personal thoughts, interesting events in court, poetry, and some opinions on her contemporaries. While it is mostly a personal work, Shōnagon&#x27;s writing and poetic skill makes it interesting as a work of literature, and it is valuable as a historical document. Shōnagon meant her writing in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; for her eyes only, but part of it was accidentally revealed to the Court during her life: &quot;she inadvertently left it [her writing] on a cushion she put out for a visiting guest, who eagerly carried it off despite her pleas.&quot; She wrote &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; as a private endeavor of enjoyment for herself; it seemed to be a way for her to express her inner thoughts and feelings that she was not allowed to state publicly due to her lower standing position in the court. Though Shōnagon never intended her work for eyes other than her own, through the centuries it has become a famous work of literature. Six passages from the book were first translated into English in 1889 by T. A. Purcell and W. G. Aston. Other notable English translations have been the partial translation by Arthur Waley in 1928, the first complete translation by Ivan Morris in 1967, and Meredith McKinney&#x27;s complete translation in 2006.

==Overview==
Starting with the &quot;exhaustiveness&quot; of the &quot;collection of similar things&quot; and how it is represented by &quot;as for worms&quot;, &quot;as for the flowers of trees&quot;, &quot;hateful things&quot;, and &quot;things of beauty&quot; – which have been described anachronistically as &quot;Borgesian lists&quot; – author Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s &quot;Ramblings&quot; observe the nature of everyday life and the four seasons, and describe in diverse sentences &quot;her recollections&quot; (her diary) that look back at the society of the imperial court surrounding Empress Teishi whom she served, among other things.

According to Meredith McKinney in the Kyoto Journal article, (who contributed to the translation of &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; from Japanese into English), &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is a special case, and it is a genre-bending miscellany of short, largely unrelated pieces. Shōnagon&#x27;s writing is categorized into three parts; the first consists of narratives, which focus mainly on the events that she witnessed and experienced during her time in the court, the second consists of her own thoughts and opinions on various matters and topics, and the third were the famous lists, or headings, with one example from Shōnagon&#x27;s writing being &quot;Things That Make the Heart Grow Fonder.&quot; &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; consists of 164 of these lists total, where they range from aesthetically pleasing items to being less diplomatic than Shōnagon&#x27;s anecdotes. Three types of classification were proposed by Kikan Ikeda. However, there are sections that are rather ambiguous and are difficult to classify (e.g., in the first paragraph of her ramblings, &quot;As for Spring, (it is) the dawn [that is lovely]&quot;, there are objections to common opinions of what is actually meant here).

It is composed primarily in Japanese hiragana, which is a syllabary that is actually derived from Chinese characters, and generally many of her short stories were written in a witty literary style. This style of writing was the native tongue for women in that time period and was used more often by women like Shōnagon. According to Matthew Penney in his critiquing article &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, the only Chinese terms that actually appear in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; are in the place-names and personal titles, and the rest is classified as original hiragana. Confessions of her personal feelings are mixed into her writing with occasionally subtle sentimentality that reflects the downfall of the emperor&#x27;s adviser, Fujiwara no Michitaka (her biological father), as well as the misfortune of both Emperor and Empress Teishi.

Both the author&#x27;s sophisticated sense and her eye for particular things are fused; for if one compares the sentimentality of (the Pathos of Things) as found in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, similar beauty of the world is revealed through the use of the intellectual word (&#x27;lovely&#x27;) in this piece.

In general, &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is written in brief statements, where the length of one paragraph is relatively short, and it is easy to read the contents, even for modern Japanese speakers. The miscellaneous collection has been arranged loosely into three specific types, while the collection of similar things has been compiled by distinct classification, and this so-called compiling was done afterwards by the hands of people other than Sei Shōnagon. Based on the beliefs of certain scholars, most of Shonagon&#x27;s work was written during her time working in the court; however, some of the later entries were written in her later life, and were just based on her memories of the days and moments she experienced previously in the court.

An aspect that makes Shōnagon&#x27;s writing in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; different from other written diaries of her period and even modern day journals is the fact that she did not invest her time in soul-searching, nor was she searching for the attention or opinions of readers, simply because she did not invest in her writing for others, but only for herself. Shōnagon&#x27;s focus in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is based on the likes and dislikes of the world, what she is interested in personally, and the delightedness of the world that she viewed and lived in. In the Kyoto Journal article, McKinney explains that Shōnagon is &quot;engaging you [the reader], face to face across the centuries, assuming your familiarity with her and her world, compelling you to nod and smile.&quot; The selections in this anthology are meant to showcase the variety of Shonagon&#x27;s musings and anecdotes. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is a collection of anecdotes, lists, and assorted writings that is one of the best sources of information concerning the court society of the 10th century and is considered an influential landmark in the history of Japanese literature. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is written entirely in Japanese. During the late 10th and early 11th centuries, Japanese men typically wrote in Chinese, using characters, while Japanese women wrote exclusively in their native tongue, using hiragana, a syllabary derived from Chinese characters. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is a part of a large tradition of women&#x27;s literature. The simplicity and charm of Shonagon&#x27;s style has been used as an example of the finest Japanese prose to this day. Shōnagon has been described as arrogant and confrontational by many readers, according to Penney and Matthew, though they describe her as freely expressing her feelings with sharp wit.

&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; influenced a genre of Japanese writings known as (&#x27;assorted writing&#x27;).

==Background==
The Heian period was essential to the aristocratic people. Poetry and vibrant art were a big part in the imperial court, of which Shōnagon was a part. The people in the imperial court were expected to be well educated in writing. Literature was seen as a &quot;key part in social interaction.&quot; One&#x27;s writing skills could make or break their reputation. For example, Shōnagon mentions in The Pillow Book how a courtier asked her for advice for writing a poem and she had to turn him away because of his poor writing skills. During the Heian period, women had a role in society, especially those women who were considered to be upper-class. Female authors in Japan during this time were more popular since they wrote in Japanese, which was considered the &quot;people&#x27;s language,&quot; and the male authors wrote in Chinese since that was considered to be of higher status. Since female authors&#x27; works were more popular with the common people, it is safe to assume that their works influenced society.

Despite women in the Heian period still being less socially important than men, the writers studied today for their creativity and wordplay wrote in hiragana. Males tended to use kanji exclusively in order to demonstrate their command of a writing system borrowed from their neighbour, China. The newer, exclusively Japanese hiragana was used by women. It used characters for syllables allowing more freedom to express inner thoughts than the logographic kanji. Since women were excluded from public life during the Heian period, upper-class, better-educated women had vast amounts of time to write. This removal from the public sector also sheltered women from political turmoil. Hiragana allowed women to convey their thoughts and feelings regarding their lives in a language all their own. Extensive schooling was not necessary in order to describe every feeling on paper; and the syllabic hiragana could note inflections heard in speech, unlike kanji. Educated women, like Shōnagon, did occasionally use kanji. Due to it being considered male writing, for a woman to properly use and understand it demonstrated her years of study. It was a way for Shōnagon to show her intelligence simply through her way of writing.

== Textual history and English translations ==
&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; was circulated at court, and for several hundred years existed in handwritten manuscripts. First printed in the 17th century, it exists in different versions: the order of entries may have been changed by scribes with comments and passages added, edited, or deleted. Four main variants of the text are known to modern scholars. The two considered to be the most complete and accurate are the Sankanbon and Nōinbon texts. Later editors introduced section numbers and divisions; the Sankanbon text is divided into 297 sections, with an additional 29 &quot;supplemental&quot; sections which may represent later additions by the author or copyists.

==Other pillow books==
More generally, a pillow book is a collection of notebooks or notes which have been collated to show a period of someone or something&#x27;s life. In Japan such kind of idle notes are generally referred to as the genre. Other major works from the same period include Kamo no Chōmei&#x27;s and Yoshida Kenkō&#x27;s . rose to mainstream popularity in the Edo period, when it found a wide audience in the newly developed merchant classes. Furthermore, it gained a scholarly foothold, as Japanese classical scholars began customarily writing in the style. Reputable authors from this movement include Motoori Norinaga, Yokoi Yayu, and Matsudaira Sadanobu.

Peter Greenaway released his film &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; in 1996. Starring Vivian Wu and Ewan McGregor, it tells a modern story that references Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s work.

&quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is also the name of a series of radio thrillers written by Robert Forrest and broadcast on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour Drama&quot;. These are detective stories with Sei Shōnagon as a principal character and feature many of her lists.

<text>Malagueta pepper (), a variety of &quot;Capsicum frutescens&quot;, is a type of chili pepper widely used in the Portuguese-speaking world (Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, Angola, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe) and the Caribbean. It got its name from the unrelated melegueta pepper, an African spice from Guinea which is a member of the ginger family. 

The malagueta pepper is a small, tapered chili that grows to about 5 cm (2 in) in length. It has a range of 60,000 to 100,000 Scoville units.

==Nomenclature==
Two sizes are seen in markets, which sometimes have different names: the smaller ones are called &#x27; in Brazil, and as (a Swahili name) in Mozambique and in Portugal, though this name is now also used for a newer, derived African cultivar, the pepper), while the larger ones are called &#x27; in both Brazil and Portugal. They are not different varieties, just peppers of different maturities from the same plant. It is also known in Angola by the names of &quot;jindungo&quot;, &quot;ndongo&quot;, &quot;nedungo&quot;, and &quot;pripíri&quot; in various local languages. In Cape Verde, malagueta is called and in the Capeverdean language.

Some botanical and culinary writers continue to confuse malagueta chili and melegueta pepper due simply to their similar names.

==History==
The first Europeans to have contact with this species were the crew members who accompanied Christopher Columbus when they first landed in the Caribbean in 1492. In addition to being a noble delicacy much appreciated by the ancient inhabitants of the Americas, it was also used as a natural dye and, above all, as a medicine.

The spicy capsaicin content of the chilis must have aroused the interest of the Portuguese, who for decades have been looking for easier sources for the then-rare black pepper of Asia (the piquant compound in which is piperine); one of the major motivations for the Columbian voyages was to discover a new route to Asia for direct trade in spices, silks, and other Asian goods. At the time of Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the New World, the Portuguese traded from the Gulf of Guinea a very popular African spice as a substitute for the black pepper: &quot;Aframomum melegueta&quot; (today in disuse in the West, but known as grains of paradise), which was then best known as melegueta pepper. Although African slaves loved the grains of paradise already familiar in their culture, they were fascinated by the fiery Capsicum pepper. The name was applied to the local chilis, as , because the chili&#x27;s piquancy was reminiscent of Old World pepper.

In the period of intense exchanges and trips between Europe and the Americas known today as the Columbian exchange, Portuguese navigators took this new &quot;malagueta&quot; to Portugal and to Brazil, where it became known as , , or ; to Africa, where it became very popular as &quot;jindungo&quot; and &quot;piri-piri&quot;; and eventually to Asia, where it became an ingredient of curries and other spicy dishes. Because of its qualities, less than a century after being brought to Europe this chili pepper spread to many other Old World cultures and became integrated with local cuisines, including in Arabia, India, Thailand, China, and surrounding regions.

==Uses==

This pepper is used to season many regional dishes and sauces in Brazil and Mozambique. In Portugal, it is mainly used to season poultry dishes and traditional cooking. Moqueca, a traditional dish in Brazil, includes it. 

In Brazil, what is now being sold as malagueta may well be a recent hybrid, while what is now referred to as , , may well be the original malagueta, and was actually the only malagueta on the market 30 years ago. While there have been claims that , , and are other names for malagueta, these are quite different, and they appear to belong to the &quot;Capsicum chinense&quot; species. 

In the cuisine of São Tomé and Príncipe, &quot;piri-piri&quot; sauce made with malagueta peppers is commonly available as a condiment in restaurants throughout São Tomé and Príncipe, as well as in Portugal.

In the Dominican Republic, malagueta is mixed with allspice to make a preparation called .

In the municipality of Borba, Amazonas, Brazil, the malagueta pepper is also used to ward off the evil eye, which is rooted in feelings of envy.

<text>The Queensland Reds is the rugby union team based in Brisbane for the Australian state of Queensland that competes in the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s Super Rugby competition. Prior to 1996, they were a representative team selected from the rugby union club competitions in Queensland. With the introduction of the professional Super 12 competition they moved to a model where players are contracted to the Reds through the Queensland Rugby Union rather than selected on the basis of club form.

From 1996 to 2005 they were one of three Australian teams competing in the Super 12 competition, alongside the New South Wales Waratahs and the ACT Brumbies. Queensland finished as minor premiers in 1996 and 1999. From 2006 to 2010, they competed in the expanded Super 14 competition as one of four Australian sides. Beginning in 2011, they are one of five Australian sides in the expanded and renamed Super Rugby, winning the competition in its first season in its new format (2011). In 2012 they finished first in the Australian conference and won the Super Rugby AU title in 2021, when regionalised competitions were played due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first recorded games of rugby in Queensland were played in 1876, when the existing Brisbane Football Club (formed in 1866), switched to rugby to align with the newly formed &#x27;Rangers&#x27; and &#x27;Bonnet Rouge&#x27; football clubs. However, it was reported that the game was soon varied to suit the preferences of the local players, and “rugby, with Brisbane variations, was the game played” (The &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot;, 10 July 1876). Most of these games were played at the Queen&#x27;s Park (now part of the City Botanic Gardens (see image at right). However, the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; reported in 1879 that the Brisbane FC had reverted to what had become known as the &#x27;Victorian rules&#x27;, “in place of the Rugby Union Rules played by the club during the last three seasons”.

In 1880, the club became a foundation member of the Queensland Football Association (QFA), along with Wallaroo, Excelsiors and Athenians (Ipswich), where it was decided to recognise and play mostly &#x27;Victorian rules&#x27;, with occasional games of &#x27;Rugby&#x27; rules. However, in 1882, a Brisbane FC representative (Daniel Foley Pring Roberts) arranged a rugby match against the Sydney Wallaroos Rugby club, after the NSWRU (Rugby Union) offered to pay all costs associated with the match. Brisbane advocates of the Victorian rules game reacted angrily and declared that no QFA player would be permitted to play under rugby rules, which led to the formation of the Northern Rugby Union (now the Queensland Rugby Union) in late 1883.

The following years saw rapidly increasing popularity of the rugby game. As rugby historian Sean Fagan noted:
:&quot;The defining moment in the code battle came with the 1886 Queensland &quot;[Rugby]&quot; side, who defeated NSW for the first time in Sydney. “The success of this team undoubtedly won the day for rugby game in Queensland. The Victorian game supporters were struggling hard to uphold the premier position they had gained but after the brilliant performance of the 1886 team, who lost only one match through their tour, the rugby game became very popular and the next season several new clubs were formed and the Victorian game began to wane” (QRU Annual, 1902).&quot;

In 1883, the first inter-colonial match in Brisbane took place, with Queensland defeating New South Wales 12 to 11 at the Eagle Farm Racecourse. In 1896 the first Queensland team departed for a tour of New Zealand, where they played New Zealand at Athletic Park in Wellington on 15 August, losing 9 to nil. In 1899 Queensland recorded their first win against an international team, defeating The Lions 11 to 3 at the Exhibition Ground (see team photo at right).

The Queensland team remained a representative team selected solely from the rugby union clubs within the state, until the advent of the Super rugby competition in the 1990s.

===Pre-Super competitions===
With the start up of rugby league as well as World War I, Queensland rugby was dormant for a number of years, and the QRU was disbanded in 1919 and was not revived until the late 1920s. In 1928 the QRU was re-formed, and the GPS competition and major clubs soon returned. The game struggled during World War II, but growth was nonetheless apparent, with the advent of the Queensland Junior Rugby Union and the Country Rugby Union. In 1950 the QRU secured the Normanby Oval at nominal rent from Brisbane Grammar School, before they moved into Ballymore Stadium in 1966, which would serve as the spiritual home of Queensland. In 1980 Queensland defeated the All Blacks, which was their first win against New Zealand. The match was played at Ballymore on 6 July and Queensland won 9 to 3. Two seasons later centenary celebrations took place, with Queensland defeating New South Wales 41 to 7 in the celebratory match.

===Early Super Rugby===
The first Super 10 was held in 1993. Queensland were grouped in Pool A alongside Auckland, Natal, Western Samoa and Otago. Queensland finished with five points, in fourth place. The subsequent Super 10 competition of 1994 saw Queensland finish at the top of Pool A on 13 points, edging out North Harbour on for and against differential to finish at the top. The Queensland Reds went on to play the winner of Pool B, South African side, . The Reds won the final, 21 points to 10 at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. The following season was even more successful for the Reds, who were playing in Pool B for the 1995 season. They finished the season with 16 points, four points clear of second placed team in their pool, the Free State. South African team Transvaal had finished at the top of Pool A and the final was to be decided at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Queensland won the final 30–16, and thus became back-to-back champions.

===Super 12===
With rugby union going professional, there was a reworking of competitions. The SANZAR partnership was formed between the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU), the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) and the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) and the Super 12 was born. In the 1996 season Queensland finished at the top of the table.

Queensland hosted their Super 12 semi-final on 18 May 1996. The game was played at Queensland&#x27;s home of rugby union, Ballymore, and was played against the Sharks. The Sharks defeated Queensland 43–25. The 1997 season saw the Reds finish in ninth place. In 1998 the Reds had a much better season, finishing in fifth position at the end of the season.

In 1999 Queensland lost only three games during the regular season, and finished at the top of the ladder on 36 points (beating the Stormers to first position due to for and against points). The Reds hosted the Canterbury Crusaders at Ballymore for a semi-final. Canterbury won 28–22. In 2000 the Reds finished in seventh place on the ladder. In 2001 the Reds finished in fourth place on the ladder and played in the semis. They played fellow Australian team, the Brumbies in Canberra, and the Brumbies won 30 points to six. The following season, 2002, the Reds finished in fifth place. For the 2003 season, Queensland finished in eighth place. Queensland finished tenth in the 2004 and 2005 Super 12 seasons.

===Super 14===
In 2006, the Super 12 became the Super 14 with the addition of the Western Force (AUS) and the Cheetahs (RSA). Queensland played the Waratahs in the opening game of the season, which was a close loss. The Reds also played new team the Western Force, which Queensland won. Queensland finished 12th on the ladder. Former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones took over from Jeff Miller as coach for the 2007 season.

New coach Eddie Jones got off to a winning start at Queensland Rugby, with a Queensland XV, 63–22 victory over the NEC club. The Reds took part in the one-off Australian Provincial Championship not getting the start they wanted, losing to the Force 32–6 at home in round one but turned it around the next week beating the Waratahs 39–17 in Gosford. The following week the Reds beat the competition leaders the Brumbies 20–19 after a penalty goal by Lloyd Johansson to qualify for the final in the ACT against the same team they beat. However, Queensland lost 42–17. Later in the year Queensland beat the Cherry Blossoms 29–22 in Japan.

The 2007 Super 14 season saw the Queensland Reds finishing a poor season by winning the wooden spoon, they couldn&#x27;t have started the competition any better when they beat 2006 Grand Finalists the Wellington Hurricanes in Round 1, after that win they would not taste victory again until Round 12. The season was summed up in the final round of the regular season where Queensland were defeated 92–3 by the Bulls. This defeat was by the largest margin in Super Rugby history, although the NSW Waratahs had 96 points scored against them in their loss to the Crusaders in 2002.

The 2008 Super 14 season witnessed a mini-resurgence of the Qld Reds, with the youthful side playing exciting and enterprising rugby under new coach Phil Mooney, they gained revenge against the Bulls after the 2007 thrashing by beating them 40–8, in what was the highlight of the season for the Reds. The Reds continued to play exciting rugby for the rest of the season but lost close matches against the Crusaders, Blues, Chiefs and Waratahs, while the side finished 12th they showed plenty of promise and regained some respect.

The 2010 Super 14 showed the real potential of a team that had been on the ropes for the last 6 years. After losing their star back Berrick Barnes to the Waratahs they unearthed the talent they had not noticed like that of Quade Cooper, Digby Ioane and Will Genia. They became the feel–good team of the year becoming the only team to beat both the year&#x27;s finalists under the new coach, former Waratahs mentor Ewen McKenzie. The highlight of their year was their 19–12 victory over the Bulls in which they played out a fast game to beat a truly world class side. A late injury plague affected the last two games of the season and ultimately a finals spot. Although the Reds missed the finals, they showed good prospects for the 2011 Super Rugby season.

===Super Rugby===

In the debut season of the renamed and revamped Super Rugby competition, the Queensland Reds showed their improvement from the previous few years. The Reds finished the regular season at the top of the table, with 13 wins and 3 losses. In the final, Queensland Reds achieved their first Super Rugby Championship in the professional era, beating the Crusaders (18–13) in front of a record crowd (52,113) at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane. Following the win the Reds were handed the keys to the city after a ticker-tape parade through Brisbane.

Following the title win, though, the Reds fell down the Super Rugby ladder, finishing 13th in 2014 and 2015, and 15th in 2016 and 14th in 2017, post Super Rugby Expansion.

In 2018, former All Black Brad Thorn was appointed head coach, where he promised to turn the franchise around. Despite finishing 13th and sacking several high-profile players, the Reds had their most successful season in five years.

They repeated their 6–10 record in 2019, before making the coronavirus-enforced Super Rugby AU final in 2020, losing to the Brumbies.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continued, domestic competitions continued in 2021. The Reds impressed in this, winning 7 of their 8 games, winning the final against the Brumbies, before finishing 7th in Super Rugby Trans-Tasman.

==Colours and logos==

The teams&#x27; home strip traditionally was a maroon jumper with a white collar, navy shorts with maroon socks with white hoops. In more recent years the jumper has become more red in colour with the home playing strip now red jumper (no collar), red shorts and red socks. The jersey is manufactured by KooGa, and the primary shirt sponsor from 2011 St George Bank . Traditionally, the Reds Super Rugby logo as well as the traditional Q logo both appear on the jersey, however for 2007 a commemorative shield was worn instead, which incorporated the QRU&#x27;s four logos over the past 100 years. The Super Rugby logo and sponsors Tooheys New appear on the sleeves. The alternative jersey is similar, except that it is predominantly white. The Reds&#x27; logo is a koala, a native Australian animal, with Reds written underneath it.

Prior to 1895 the Queensland team wore a variety of jerseys until the red/maroon colour became the Queensland jersey. In 2007, the Reds used a commemorative jersey in celebration of 125 years of Queensland rugby. This was accompanied by a new logo featuring four Queensland crests from the past. The 125-year crest featured four sectors: the Northern Rugby Union logo from 1882 (top left), the emblem from 1910 (top right), the 1935 logo (bottom left) and the current koala logo (bottom right).

==Stadium==
The traditional home of Queensland Rugby is Ballymore, which was built in the late 1960s in Herston. Throughout the Super 12, the Reds played their home matches at that stadium.

With the expansion of Super 12 to 14 for the 2006 season, the Reds moved to the 52,500-seat Suncorp Stadium; which has been described as an investment in the future of the Queensland Rugby, with easier access and world class facilities.

The Reds have also played numerous pre-season games at the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, and Darling Downs regions, in order to raise the team&#x27;s profile outside of Brisbane.

In 2006 and 2021, the Reds travelled to Townsville to play a regular season game, both times attracting almost 20 000.

==Anthem/Chants==
In January 2007, the Queensland Reds released a team anthem to be sung by the crowd during matches and after wins. The song was sung in the Queen Street Mall by members of the team including John Roe, Ben Tune, Peter Hynes and Berrick Barnes . The Reds also launched new marketing campaigns for 2007 (e.g. &quot;Join the Revolution&quot;/&quot;The Red Army Needs You&quot;); and the fans have since been referred to as &quot;The Red Army&quot;. Major sponsor St George Bank sponsor a cheer squad at some games known as the St George Fan Bank.

At home games, the chant “We are Red” is commonplace as the home crowd get behind their team.

‘Take Me Home, Country Roads’ by John Denver is belted out at the conclusion of wins, an anthem of sorts.

==Fans==
The Reds have one of the largest and die-hard followings in Brisbane, averaging 19 118 at their 2021 home games and filling Suncorp Stadium for their 6 semi-final and two Grand Final appearances, including the 2021 Harvey Norman Super Rugby AU Final against the ACT Brumbies.

Queensland Rugby CEO David Hanham claimed the fan base was growing once more after half a decade of on-field struggles, with the organisation passing 15 000 members in 2023 for the first time since 2018. He also pointed out how the organisation has the potential to be the largest sports union in Queensland.

==Rivalries==
Queenslands most popular rivalries are against the other Australian teams in Super Rugby (Brumbies, Western Force, Waratahs and Melbourne Rebels). The most famous of these rivalries is the interstate clash between the Queensland Reds and the New South Wales Waratahs. The match between these two sides usually draws the largest crowd for the Reds when they are hosting the match, which is sometimes (such as in 2006), used as the first game of the season. The Bob Templeton Cup is a trophy awarded to the winner of the Queensland/New South Wales match.

Former Queensland captain John Eales, prior to the Queensland and New South Wales clash in 2001, quoted former Wallaby Mark Loane to sum up matches against New South Wales, &quot;the most hard fought fights are fighting with your brother in the backyard&quot;. There have been over 270 matches between the two teams, with New South Wales well in the lead with over 170 wins, and Queensland over 80, with 12 drawn. Since the start of professional Super rugby in 1996, 17 matches have been played, Queensland winning nine, New South Wales seven, and one being drawn.

==Region==
 
Due to historical and practical reasons, the team represents the entire state of &quot;Queensland&quot;. However the team has been based entirely in the South East Queensland region since its foundation. The team has played matches at numerous venues, including Queen&#x27;s Park, the Eagle Farm Racecourse, the Brisbane Showgrounds, Ballymore Stadium and its current home Lang Park.
== Development teams==
The QRU formerly owned and managed two National Rugby Championship teams, Brisbane City and Queensland Country. These NRC teams drew on a range of players ranging from full-time professionals to those on incentive contracts. These teams were closely aligned with the Reds and train at Ballymore, the QRU&#x27;s training base used by the Reds. The NRC is now defunct but is set to return in the near future.

Brisbane City and Queensland Country also field Under 19, 18, and 16 teams. 

===Queensland Reds A===
The Queensland A team plays matches against interstate and international representative teams, and has also competed in tournaments such as the Pacific Rugby Cup. Known by various names over the years including Queensland A, Reds A, Reds College XV, and Reds Academy, the team is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in Queensland. The squad is a mix of Reds contracted players, extended training squad members, Queensland Under 19s, and selected Premier Rugby club players.

===Under 19===
Two Queensland teams, Brisbane City U19 and Queensland Country U19, play in the national URC competition. Prior to 2008, state colts teams at under 21 and under 19 age levels were fielded in national tournaments and in the Trans-Tasman Trophy, but these teams were consolidated as under 20s ahead of the inaugural World Rugby U20 Championship. In 2018, an under 19 age limit was reinstated for the national colts team competition.

<doc id="481241" wikidata="Q1129419" url="?curid=481241" title="Convergent Technologies">
<text>Convergent Technologies, Inc., was an American computer company formed by a small group of people who left Intel Corporation and Xerox PARC in 1979. Among the founders were CEO Allen Michels, VP Engineering Bob Garrow, head of marketing Kal Hubler, and operating system architect Ben Wegbreit. Convergent was primarily an OEM vendor with their computers resold by other manufacturers such as ADP, AT&amp;T, Burroughs, Four-Phase Systems, Gould, Mohawk, Monroe Data Systems, NCR, and Prime. The company was purchased by Unisys in 1988.

==History==
The Distributed Systems division was responsible for the IWS, AWS, and NGEN.

In 1982, Convergent formed the Data Systems division to focus on a multi-processor computer known as the MegaFrame, &quot;the first system upgradable from super-minicomputer to mainframe&quot;. The division was headed by Ben Wegbreit and also responsible for the MiniFrame. Steve Blank, in charge of division marketing, went on to found several Silicon Valley startups, including E.piphany, and lectures on technology startups at Stanford University and elsewhere; Jon Huie was in charge of Software; Richard Lowenthal was in charge of Hardware.

Convergent also formed the Advanced Information Products division, with Matt Sanders taking lead of the new division. He was tasked with developing a computer for the low-end market (price target $499). The &quot;Ultra&quot; team was assembled and their pioneering mobile computing product, the WorkSlate, released in November 1983.

The Special Projects division was responsible for the AT&amp;T products.

Former Hewlett-Packard executive Paul C. Ely Jr. took over as CEO in January 1985.

Michels, Sanders, Wegbreit, and another executive left in October 1985 to form The Dana Group. Shortly after, Convergent purchased 40% of Baron Data Systems for $14.6 million. Then purchased the remainder of Baron in May 1987, for $33 million.

Convergent reached an agreement to acquire 3Com in March 1986, but the merger was called off at the last moment.

Unisys bought Convergent Technologies in 1988, after which Convergent Technologies became Unisys Network Computing Group (NCG).

==Products==
===IWS===
Introduced in 1980, Convergent&#x27;s first product was the IWS (Integrated Workstation) based on a 5 MHz Intel 8086 microprocessor, with optional Intel 8087 math coprocessor. The WS-110 integrated the processor, memory I/O, and video display control boards along with two Multibus slots into a unique &quot;lectern&quot; situated next to the monitor and integrated into a common base. The WS-120 placed these boards along with five Multibus slots in a floor-standing enclosure. Floor-standing mass storage units would also be integrated into a system. The video hardware supported &quot;soft fonts&quot; allowing the character set to be changed in RAM rather than a fixed character set in ROM. 

Burroughs sold the IWS as the B22, NCR sold it as the WorkSaver 100, and Savin released the Information Station 2000.

===AWS===
Introduced in November 1981, the next product was a cost-reduced desktop version called the AWS (Application Workstation) utilizing an Intel 8275 CRT controller instead of the custom video board used in the IWS. The IWS and AWS were compatible and ran in an RS-422 clustered environment under the proprietary Convergent Technologies Operating System (CTOS). In December 1982, Convergent announced the AWS Turbo Color Graphics Workstation using the NEC 7220 graphics controller with 128 KB display memory.

The AWS was sold by Burroughs as the B21, by Bull as the Corail B4000, by Prime Computer as the Prime Producer 100 (a word processing workstation), by NCR as the WorkSaver 200, and by Savin as the Information Station 1000.

===MegaFrame===
Available in August 1983, the MegaFrame (S/1280) consisted of up to eight 10 MHz Motorola 68010-based &quot;Application Processors&quot; running UNIX System III-derived CTIX talking to 8 MHz Intel 80186-based I/O processor boards each running their own scaled-down versions of CTOS: File Processor (&quot;fpCTOS&quot;), Cluster Processor (&quot;cpCTOS&quot;), Terminal Processor (&quot;tpCTOS&quot;), and SMD/Storage Processor (&quot;spCTOS&quot;). Each processor had its own RAM: 512 KB to 4 MB for the Application Processors, and 256 KB to 768 KB for the I/O processors. Up to 36 boards could be installed in a system: six in the base enclosure, with another six per expansion enclosure (five expansion enclosures maximum). Each File Processor could support up to four disks.

The MegaFrame was resold by Burroughs/Unisys as the XE550 running CENTIX and BTOS, and originally sold as the XE500 and XE520 without the Application Processors. Motorola/Four-Phase resold the MegaFrame as the System 6600.

===NGEN===

The AWS was replaced by the modular NGEN (Next Generation) workstation in late 1983, based on the Intel 80186 microprocessor. To Burroughs (and Unisys) users the NGEN was known as the B25 and to Prime Computer users as the Prime Producer 200. Bull sold the NGEN as the Questar 400, and NCR sold it as the WorkSaver 300. The NGEN was also sold with an MS-DOS version running on top of CTOS. It was sold as the M1000 by McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company (previously known as Microdata Corporation) who included a copy of their Pick-based Reality relational database which ran on MS-DOS. Datapoint released the NGEN as the Vista-PC running MS-DOS. Mohawk Data Sciences released the NGEN-based MDS HERO, and Telenorma/Bosch released the Isy. Other OEMs were the Gould Power Station and A. B. Dick Knowledge Worker.

Later models - the NGEN Series 286 (Burroughs B28), 386 (Burroughs B38), and 386i (Burroughs B39) - kept pace with Intel CPU development through the Intel 80386. (A successor to the NGEN called the SuperGen and based on the Intel 80486 was introduced in 1993 by Unisys, approximately 5 years after it had acquired Convergent Technologies.)

===WorkSlate===
Released in November 1983, the WorkSlate, an early tablet-style personal computer system, was designed and marketed by Convergent, with the industrial design done by Mike Nuttall. It was 1&quot; thick and the size of a sheet of paper. Its primary user interface was a spreadsheet. The WorkSlate utilized a mini-cassette for voice- and data-recording and for loading a range of pre-packaged add-on applications called TaskWare to handle jobs such as the management of personal expenses, calendars, etc. At that time there was no facility to download such &quot;apps&quot; over the Internet, so they were available only on the mini-cassettes. The WorkSlate was developed in a highly compressed twelve-month development cycle which resulted in inadequate testing and a sub-optimal product which sold poorly. It was discontinued in the summer of 1984.

===MiniFrame===
Convergent introduced the Motorola 68010-based MiniFrame in May 1984 running CTIX. The MiniFrame came with 512 KB on the motherboard and could be extended with up to four stackable expansion boards (Ethernet, eight RS-232 ports, 512 KB memory boards), with a max of 2 MB RAM using three memory boards. The MiniFrame was used as the basis to develop the AT&amp;T UNIX PC.

NCR and Burroughs were two resellers of the MiniFrame. Gould sold the MiniFrame as the Powerstation 2000 running UTX/2000. Motorola resold the MiniFrame as the System 6300 under the Four-Phase Systems Series 6000. Motorola/Four-Phase pioneered development of international character support for Unix platforms for their EMEA business using the CTOS/CTIX equipment.

===AT&amp;T UNIX PC===

Convergent developed the first Motorola 68010 OEM UNIX product for AT&amp;T, the AT&amp;T UNIX PC, released in March 1985. The UNIX PC integrated a number features (Stream-based I/O, Multinational Language Support) to the Intel AT&amp;T UNIX base (SVR3.2). Convergent also offered this machine directly as the S/50.

===AT&amp;T Personal Terminal 510===
Convergent developed the integrated voice/data Personal Terminal 510A (analog) and 510D (digital) for AT&amp;T, introduced in March 1985. The 510A was for use with POTS lines, and the 510D for use with the AT&amp;T System 75/85 PBX. The terminals featured a unique gel-based 9&quot; touch screen providing a soft, cushiony feel.

===MightyFrame===
Released in 1986, Convergent used the Motorola 68020 and 68040 in their VME-based MightyFrame systems (S/80, S/120, S/221, S/222, S/280, S/320, S/480, S/640), all running CTIX.

===Server PC===
The 20-MHz 386-based Server PC running CTIX/386 (SVR3) was released in 1987. Merge 386 allowed Unix and DOS applications to run simultaneously, allowing the machine to function as both a PC server and 32-user Unix machine.

<text>UWC Atlantic (formally the United World College of the Atlantic, and often referred to by its original name, Atlantic College) is an independent boarding school in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales. Founded in 1962, it was the first of the United World Colleges and was among the first educational institutions in the world to follow an international curriculum. It helped create the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in the 1960s.

It is attended by approximately 350 students from more than 90 countries, with the students being refugees, war victims, and members of persecuted communities, who live and study alongside members of royal families and political dynasties from across the globe.

The majority of its students are selected internationally through their National Committees which facilitate nationwide selection processes across the world in over 120 countries, and help fund student education through partial or full scholarships. Over 65% of students who apply through these national committees receive some form of scholarship or financial aid awards. 

In addition to the IBDP, UWC Atlantic places student participation in community service at its core. It is known for its liberal education, its global ethos, and its strong focus on local and global development and sustainability.

== History ==
Atlantic College was founded by Kurt Hahn, a German educationalist who had previously set up the Schule Schloss Salem and the Stiftung Louisenlund in Germany, Gordonstoun School in Scotland, and the Outward Bound movement. Hahn founded the college as a practical response to the search for new and peaceful solutions in a post-war world riven by political, racial and economic divisions. Hahn had been invited by British Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall to address the NATO Defence College in 1955, where he saw former enemies from several nations working together towards a common goal, and realised how much more could be done to overcome the hostility of the Cold War if young people from different nations could be brought together in a similar way. He envisaged a college for students who were already grounded in their own cultures but impressionable enough to learn from others. Drawn from all nations, the students would be selected purely on merit and potential, regardless of race, religion, nationality and background. The college was the result of Kurt Hahn&#x27;s vision and the work of individuals such as the founding Headmaster Rear Admiral Desmond Hoare, Director of Studies Robert Blackburn, Air Marshal Sir Lawrance Darvall, Alec Peterson (who established the curriculum for the college, and later served as the International Baccalaureate&#x27;s first director-general), and Antonin Besse, who donated St Donat&#x27;s Castle for the college&#x27;s premises.

On 19 September 1962, Atlantic College opened with nine teaching staff and 56 male students aged between 16 and 19 years from 12 countries; in 1967, the school became co-educational, with a cohort hailing from 35 nations. The school was hailed by &quot;The Times of London&quot; as &quot;the most exciting experiment in education since the Second World War.&quot; 

From its founding, the school was intended to be the first of a series, initially to be named &quot;The Atlantic Colleges.&quot; In 1967, Lord Mountbatten of Burma became President of the organisation and the term United World Colleges came into existence, with an international office in London, and the school became known as the United World College of the Atlantic. Mountbatten was an enthusiastic UWC supporter and encouraged heads of state, politicians and personalities throughout the world to share his interest. He was personally involved in founding what became the third UWC – the United World College of South East Asia – in Singapore in 1975, following the founding of the second College, the Lester B Pearson United World College of the Pacific in Canada in 1974.

In 1978, Mountbatten passed the Presidency to his great-nephew, the then Prince of Wales, Charles. Former presidents of the United World Colleges also include Nelson Mandela of South Africa (from 1995 until his death in 2013), a position he shared with the current holder of the position, Queen Noor of Jordan. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was a Patron of the college, from its early days until her death in 2022.

== College ==
The college&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;make education a force to unite people, nations, and cultures for peace and a sustainable future&quot;. Students from over 90 countries participate in UWC Atlantic&#x27;s two-year programme, in which they combine academic studies with activities and service. Admission into United World Colleges, and scholarship awards, are decided by national UWC committees around the world and the Global Selection Programme.

=== Academics ===
Atlantic College was one of the first colleges in the world, and the first in the UK, to follow an international curriculum, and offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The college was one of the key institutions involved in the creation of the International Baccalaureate, and continues to be actively involved in its development. In May 1967, 108 students at Atlantic College joined 37 at the International School of Geneva to sit the first trial exams for the IB. Having already participated in these pilot exams in parallel to offering the British GCE A-Levels, in 1971 Atlantic College became the first school in the world to entirely abandon a national curriculum and qualifications in favor of the new program.

The college also offered a Pre-Diploma course, offering 15-16-year-old students the chance to study IGCSEs among the rest of the college&#x27;s older population. This programme ended in 2019.

IB graduates are typically accepted at the most competitive colleges and universities around the world, with many enrolling in Ivy League universities in the United States as well as British universities. Students at the college are eligible, after graduation, to participate in the Davis United World College Scholars Program, which funds undergraduate study for UWC students at selected universities in the United States.

=== Service ===
Service has been a core part of the college&#x27;s ethos and structure since its founding, rooted in Kurt Hahn&#x27;s philosophy and belief that physical activity and especially service to others were vital elements of a well rounded education. At the beginning of each year at the college, students are obliged to select 3 activities that they will each carry out for at least 2 hours a week as part of the International Baccalaureate&#x27;s &quot;Creativity, Action, Service&quot; (CAS) requirement. The opportunity to undertake weekly community service, physical activity, and creative activity offers students a &#x27;counterbalance&#x27; to the Diploma Programme&#x27;s academic pressures, and allows the students an opportunity to reflect on their experiences and develop specific interests and passions.

Additionally, UWC Atlantic runs a &quot;Project Week&quot; every year, giving students a change to delve into either service based or expedition based experiences, and hosts student-ran Conferences on a quarterly basis offering deep introspection to students into the chosen conference topic.

===Boat-building===

The college has a strong tradition of boat design and boat building. The Atlantic College Lifeboat Station stood within its grounds as an active RNLI lifeboat station from 1963, when it opened as one of the first experimental inshore lifeboat (ILB) stations established in the United Kingdom, and staffed mostly by students participating in the college&#x27;s Inshore Lifeboat service, until 2013.
Much of the development of the Atlantic 21, 75 and 85 classes of lifeboat took place at Atlantic College. What was to become the world&#x27;s most widely used type of craft for inshore rescue, the rigid inflatable boat (RIB), was originally conceived, designed, prototyped, tested, and built at the college under its founding headmaster, retired Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare. The B Class Atlantic Inshore Lifeboat was named by the RNLI after its birthplace. It has often been claimed that, had the college earned royalties on every rigid-hulled inflatable boat now in service, its scholarship fund would have never looked back; instead, Desmond Hoare, who eventually patented the design in 1973, sold the rights to the RNLI for the nominal fee of one pound; he did not cash the cheque, which is still displayed at the college. David Sutcliffe, a member of the founding staff of Atlantic College in 1962 and its second headmaster, published &quot;The RIB The Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Lifeboat and its Place of Birth The Atlantic College&quot; in 2010, a book that tells the story of the inception of the RIB (rigid inflatable boat).

The building of ILB training vessels at the school is a longstanding student activity, and were used for practice and training of the student-led RNLI crews at the station until its closure in 2013. In 2014 students at the college helped design a new boat in conjunction with companies in Japan, to help in the aftermath of a tsunami. The college, through Atlantic Pacific International Rescue, still provides support and training for rescue efforts for migrants making hazardous sea crossings.

===Sports===

The college offers a range of sports and fitness activities as part of the CAS component of the IB Diploma and as co-curricular activities. Facilities include indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a climbing wall, a sports hall with basketball and badminton courts, a five-a-side football pitch, dance studio, and gym equipment, and playing fields used for football and rugby. Students also participate in a range of activities that take advantage of the college&#x27;s seafront location, including cliff abseiling, rock climbing, hiking, and sea kayaking.

The college’s football team, Atlantic College Football Club, will participate in the &quot;South Wales Youth League&quot;, a regional youth league, starting in the 2024-2025 school year.

== Grounds and facilities ==
UWC Atlantic is located at St Donat&#x27;s Castle, a 12th-century castle near the town of Llantwit Major on the South Wales coast, overlooking the Bristol Channel. The castle has been continuously inhabited since it was first built. The extensive grounds also include the 12th-century St Donat&#x27;s Church and the historic terraced gardens, as well as preserved woodland, farmland and Heritage Coastline. St Donat&#x27;s Castle is the main building of the college, housing the Tudor great hall, the gothic dining hall, Bradenstoke Hall (today used for assemblies and performances), an extensive 25,000-book library, staff offices, student common areas and certain academic departments. Before being purchased for use by the college by Antonin Besse, it was owned by William Randolph Hearst, who undertook major renovations, including transporting the roof and fireplace from the Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire and an ornate, gilded and vaulted ceiling from a church in Boston, Lincolnshire.

Lessons take place in modern academic blocks built in the 1960s–80s, converted medieval estate buildings, and the castle itself. Next to the castle are the social and gymnasium blocks, and the 12th-century tithe barn (with a contemporary extension), which is both used by the college and open to the public as a theatre, arts centre and cinema. The college owns sports fields, tennis courts, and in addition to indoor and outdoor swimming pools have a range of surf and rescue equipment, kayaks, sailing boats, RNLI training boats, and a cliff suitable for climbing and rescue practice.
In 2004, the college installed a carbon neutral biomass heating system to replace an aging and unsustainable oil-based system. It runs on locally sourced sustainable woodchip biomass, and makes the campus the largest site in the UK to be heated in such a way. Students live in eight modern accommodation houses built in the castle grounds named after either ancient Welsh kingdoms, important individuals in the college&#x27;s history, and benefactors: Powys, Whitaker, Gwynedd, Kurt Hahn, Antonin Besse, Pentti Kouri, Madiba, Tice, and Sunley. The Pentti Kouri house, formerly Dyfed, was refurbished in the autumn of 2008 to include sustainable technologies such as geothermal heating and an energy usage monitoring system.

Due largely to the college&#x27;s setting at the castle, in combination with its reputation as a progressive institution, media sometimes use terms such as &quot;Hogwarts for hippies&quot; to describe the school.

The college has hosted several royal visitors to the castle, including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Lord Mountbatten, King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan, Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands, King Willem-Alexander (an alumnus) and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, and King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain. The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was marked by a visit by Queen Noor of Jordan, in her role as President of the United World Colleges. Senior politicians such as former Prime Minister of Canada Lester B. Pearson and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home also visited St Donat&#x27;s, as have several ambassadors and diplomats.
