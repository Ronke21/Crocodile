<doc id="468650" wikidata="Q442393" url="?curid=468650" title="William Maclay (Pennsylvania politician, born 1737)">
<text>William Maclay (July 20, 1737April 16, 1804) was a politician from Pennsylvania during the eighteenth century. Maclay, along with Robert Morris, was a member of Pennsylvania&#x27;s first two-member delegation to the United States Senate. He assisted John Harris, Sr. with the planning the layout of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1785, where Maclay Street is named for him. Following his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on two occasions, as a county judge, and as a presidential elector. He is known for his journal providing historical information on the 1st United States Congress.

==Early life==
Maclay was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, his parents were Presbyterian immigants of Scottish descent from Portadown, Ireland in what has since become Northern Ireland. Maclay pursued classical studies and then served as a militia lieutenant in the Battle of Fort Duquesne in 1758. He went on to serve in other expeditions in the French and Indian War.

== Career ==
He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1760. After a period of practicing law, he became a surveyor in the employ of the Penn family, and then a prothonotary and clerk of the courts of
Northumberland County in the 1770s. During the American Revolution, he served in the Continental Army as a commissary. He was also a frequent member of the Pennsylvania General Assembly in the 1780s. During that period, he was also the Indian commissioner, a judge of the court of common pleas, and a member of the executive council.

After the ratification of the Constitution Maclay was elected to the United States Senate and served in the 1st United States Congress from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1791. He received a two-year term instead of the usual six-year term for senators after he lost a lottery with the other Pennsylvania senator, Robert Morris. In the Senate, Maclay was one of the most radical members of the Anti-Administration faction.

He constantly feuded with Vice President John Adams in the Senate after Adams rejected Maclay&#x27;s political deal to support his vice-presidential candidacy during the 1789 presidential election. In July 1789 he issued a resolution requiring the President to request the Senate&#x27;s permission to dismiss Cabinet members, but it was defeated by Vice President Adams&#x27;s tiebreaking vote when Adams convinced Tristram Dalton and Richard Bassett to withdraw their support. During Senate debates over the Residence Act establishing the site of the U.S. permanent national capital and seat of government Vice President Adams worked with Morris, who preferred Philadelphia as the capital, to defeat Maclay&#x27;s motion placing it near his landholdings on the Susquehanna River.

In his journal, which is the only diary and one of the most important records of the First United States Congress, he criticizes Vice President Adams and President George Washington. He also criticized many of their supporters who ran the Senate and included particular senators, believing that their ways of running the Senate were inefficient. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to be re-elected by the state legislature of Pennsylvania. His diary expresses his dry wit and commitment to democratic principles.

Following his retirement from national politics, he was also a member of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives in 1795, 1796, and 1797. In addition, he was a presidential elector in the 1796 presidential election (voting for Jefferson), a county judge from 1801 to 1803, and a member again of the state House of Representatives in 1803. He died in 1804 and was interred in Old Paxton Church Cemetery in Harrisburg. Several of his relatives were also politicians, including his brother, Samuel Maclay, and his nephew, William Plunkett Maclay.

==Mansion and land==
Maclay retired to his farm in Dauphin, Pennsylvania in 1791, where he built a limestone mansion just north of the northern Harrisburg boundary at the time on Front Street and (ironically) South Street. In 1908, the home was purchased by William E. Bailey, a descendant of an early Harrisburg iron and steel industrialist family, who made renovations created by city architect Miller Kast to a Georgian Revival style. Presently, the building is occupied and maintained by the Pennsylvania Bar Association.

The area east of Maclay&#x27;s Mansion came to be known as &quot;Maclaysburg&quot; (present day Downtown) and extended out to what would become the Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex. Because it was undeveloped and within the floodplain, it was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Maclay&#x27;s Swamp&quot; between North and South streets and Second and Third Streets; in the winter, it was popular for ice skating. Previously trying to encourage the relocation of the capital to Harrisburg while in the U.S. Senate, Maclay sold ten acres of land to the Commonwealth prior to his death. In 1811, using that land, architect Stephen Hills began to construct the Capitol building and state office buildings after Governor Simon Snyder agreed to relocate centrally within Pennsylvania.

==Personal life and family==
He married Mary McClure Harris (1750-1809), daughter of John Harris Jr. and granddaughter of John Harris Sr., who were both the namesakes of Harrisburg. William and Mary had several children, including Eleanor, who married William Wallace and had a daughter named Mary Elizabeth Wallace DeWitt. Her relatives are Brigadier General Wallace DeWitt, General John L. DeWitt, and Brigadier General Calvin DeWitt Jr.

<text>Dary Matera (born 1955) is an author who specializes in real-life casebooks. He is from Chandler, Arizona.

Matera grew up in Bangkok, Thailand, and Angeles City, Philippines, as the son of a Voice of America foreign service officer. He attended junior high at the International School of Bangkok, and then transferred to Wagner High School on Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.

After returning to America and graduating from the University of Miami in 1977, Matera worked as a reporter for The Miami News (1977–82). He covered the city beats—education, crime, politics and general assignment.

Matera became an independent author in 1986. His first mass market, non-fiction book, &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot;, detailed the controversial story of Elvis Presley&#x27;s lifelong relationship with a troubled Louisiana woman.

Matera has appeared in a half dozen television documentaries, including programs on The FBI&#x27;s Top Ten Most Wanted, 1930s bank robber John Dillinger, 1960s cult leader Charles Manson, and 1970s giant serial killer Ed Kemper.

<doc id="468671" wikidata="Q590014" url="?curid=468671" title="Battle of Drepana">
<text>The naval Battle of Drepana (or Drepanum) took place in 249 BC during the First Punic War near Drepana (modern Trapani) in western Sicily, between a Carthaginian fleet under Adherbal and a Roman fleet commanded by Publius Claudius Pulcher.

Pulcher was blockading the Carthaginian stronghold of Lilybaeum (modern Marsala) when he decided to attack their fleet, which was in the harbour of the nearby city of Drepana. The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack but became scattered in the dark. Adherbal was able to lead his fleet out to sea before it was trapped in harbour; having gained sea room in which to manoeuvre he then counter-attacked. The Romans were pinned against the shore, and after a day of fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage&#x27;s greatest naval victory of the war; they turned to the maritime offensive after Drepana and all but swept the Romans from the sea. It was seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower.

== Historical sources ==
The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( – 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Drepana. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.

Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius&#x27;s account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising &quot;The Histories&quot; deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that &quot;Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable&quot;; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;. Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that &quot;Polybius&#x27; account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;.

Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the nearby site of the Battle of the Aegates, the final battle of the war, fought eight years later. Their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.

==Background==
===Operations in Sicily===

In 264 BC the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the River Arno under its control. Rome&#x27;s expansion into southern Italy probably made it inevitable that it would eventually clash with Carthage over Sicily on some pretext. The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina).

By 249 BC the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to defeat the Carthaginians decisively and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. In 260 BC the Romans built a large fleet and over the following ten years defeated the Carthaginians in a succession of naval battles. The Romans also slowly gained control of most of Sicily, including the major cities of Akragas (modern Agrigento; Agrigentum in Latin; captured in 262 BC) and Panormus (modern Palermo; captured in 254 BC).

===Ships===
During this war the standard warship was the quinquereme, meaning &quot;five-oared&quot;. The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 long tons (110 short tons; 100 tonnes). The galley expert John Coates suggests they could maintain for extended periods. The modern replica galley &quot;Olympias&quot; has achieved speeds of and cruised at for hours on end.

Vessels were built as cataphract, or &quot;protected&quot;, shipsthat is, fully decked overso as to be better able to carry marines and catapults. They had a separate &quot;oar box&quot; attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers. The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets – or files – of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.

In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for &quot;warship&quot; in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines, and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.

Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter Carthaginian superiority, the Romans introduced the &quot;corvus&quot;, a bridge wide and long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship&#x27;s deck. This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to board enemy ships and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley&#x27;s prow and secured with bronze spikes.

In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram&#x27;s effect even in the case of a successful attack. The Roman adaptation of the was a continuation of this trend and compensated for their initial disadvantage in ship manoeuvring skills. The added weight in the prow compromised the ship&#x27;s manoeuvrability, and in rough sea conditions the became useless. In 255 BC the Roman fleet was devastated by a storm while returning from Africa, with 384 ships sunk from a total of 464 and 100,000 men lost. It is possible that the presence of the made the Roman ships unusually unseaworthy and there is no record of them being used after this disaster. 

==Prelude==

Largely because of the Romans&#x27; use of the , the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae (260 BC), Sulci (257 BC), Ecnomus (256 BC) and Cape Hermaeum (255 BC). During 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily. In 250 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated, losing most of their elephants. Contemporary accounts do not report either side&#x27;s other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000–30,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.

Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against Lilybaeumwhich was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily. A large army commanded by the year&#x27;s consuls Publius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Junius Pullus besieged the city. They had rebuilt their fleet, and 200 ships blockaded the harbour. Early in the blockade, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcementseither 10,000 or 4,000 according to different ancient sourcesand a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.
The Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom, but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley.

In 250 BC an additional 10,000 oarsmen were allocated to the Roman fleet. Pulcher, the senior consul, supported by a council of war, believed these gave him sufficient advantage to risk an attack on the Carthaginian fleet at Drepana, north of Lilybaeum along the west coast of Sicily. The Roman fleet sailed on a moonless night to avoid detection and ensure surprise. The Romans had a tradition of divining the likely fortune of a military endeavour by observing the actions of the sacred chickens. In the early morning they would be offered food: if they ate eagerly, the omens were good; if they refused it, the action was ill-fated. When the solemn ceremony was performed on the way to Drepana, the chickens declined to eat. Infuriated, Pulcher pitched them overboard, exclaiming that if they were not hungry, then perhaps they were thirsty. Polybius does not mention this, which has caused some modern historians to doubt its veracity. T. P. Wiseman even thought that the whole episode was an invention from a hostile annalist to harm the reputation of the Claudii.

== Battle ==
By dawn the Romans were close to Drepana but were experiencing problems. In the dark it had proved difficult to keep station. This was exacerbated by the recent incorporation of the 10,000 new oarsmen, who were not trained nor experienced at working with the existing crews. As a result, morning found the Roman ships spread out in a long, disorganised line. Pulcher&#x27;s ship was towards the rear, possibly so he could discourage straggling. The Carthaginian commander, Adherbal, was taken completely by surprise when his lookouts reported the approach of the Romans. However, his ships were ready for sea, and he immediately ordered them to take on board the garrison as marines, and to follow him out to sea. The Roman fleet consisted of more than 120 ships; some sources give as many as 200. The Carthaginians had between 100 and 130 vessels. All of the warships, on both sides, were carrying full complements of marines.

The more advanced of the Roman ships had reached the mouth of the harbour and were in a position to attempt to block it. However, Pulcher, seeing that surprise was lost, ordered them to fall back and concentrate in battle formation. This order took some time to transmit and resulted in some ships responding to it and turning into the paths of others still pressing forward and fouling them. So poor was the Roman seamanship that several ships collided, or sheared the oars off friendly vessels. Meanwhile, Adherbal led his fleet past the confused Roman vanguard and continued west, passing between the city and two small islands to reach the open sea. Here they had room to manoeuvre and headed south, forming a line of battle that was parallel to the Romans. The Carthaginians managed to get five ships south of Pulcher&#x27;s flagship, echeloned towards the shore, and so cut off the entire Roman fleet from its line of retreat to Lilybaeum.

The Romans, meanwhile, had formed up in a line facing west, with the shore behind them, which prevented them from being outflanked. The Carthaginians attacked, and the weakness of Pulcher&#x27;s dispositions became apparent. The Carthaginian ships were lighter built and more manoeuvrable, and their crews were more experienced and accustomed to working together. The Romans lacked the to even the fight. On the other hand, the Carthaginians were probably outnumbered. The Carthaginians had the additional advantage that if an individual ship was getting the worse of a melee, it could reverse oars and withdraw; if the Roman vessel followed up, it left both of its flanks vulnerable. The Romans, with the shore close behind them, had no such advantage, and they attempted to stay in a tight formation for mutual protection. The battle was hard-fought and ground on through the day. The quality of the legionaries serving as the Roman marines, and their tight formation, made boarding difficult. But the Carthaginians handily outmanoeuvred the Romans, picking off exposed ships to ram, and steadily gaining more and more of an advantage. Eventually Roman discipline cracked; several ships were intentionally run aground so their crews could flee, and Pulcher led a successful breakout by 30 Roman ships, the only ones to survive the battle.

The result was an utter Roman defeat, with 93 of their ships captured, an unknown number sunk, and 20,000 men killed or captured. It was Carthage&#x27;s greatest naval victory of the war.

==Aftermath==

Shortly after the battle, Adherbal was reinforced by Carthalo with 70 ships. Adherbal brought Carthalo&#x27;s command up to 100 and sent him to raid Lilybaeum, where he burnt several Roman ships. A little later, he harried a Roman supply convoy of 800 transports, escorted by 120 warships, to such good effect that it was caught by a storm which sank all the vessels except for two. The Carthaginians further exploited their victory by raiding, ineffectively, the coasts of Roman Italy in 248 BC. The absence of Roman fleets then led Carthage to gradually decommission its navy, reducing the financial strain of building, maintaining and repairing ships, and providing and provisioning their crews. They withdrew most of their warships from Sicily, and the war there entered a period of stalemate. It was seven years after Drepana before Rome attempted to build another substantial fleet.

Pulcher was recalled and charged with treason. He was convicted of a lesser chargesacrilege over the chicken incidentnarrowly escaped a death sentence and was exiled. Pulcher&#x27;s sister, Claudia, became infamous when, obstructed in a street blocked by poorer citizens, she wished aloud that her brother would lose another battle so as to thin the crowd.

The war eventually ended in 241 BC after the Battle of the Aegates, with a Roman victory and an agreed peace. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built over 1,000 galleys during the war; and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome&#x27;s maritime dominance for 600 years.

<text>Adherbal (, ), son of Micipsa and grandson of Masinissa, was a king of Numidia between 118 and 112 BC. He inherited the throne after the death of his father, and ruled jointly with his younger brother Hiempsal, and Jugurtha, the nephew of Masinissa. After the murder of his brother by Jugurtha, Adherbal fled to Rome and was restored to his share of the kingdom by the Romans in 117 BC, with Jugurtha ruling his brother&#x27;s former share. But Adherbal was again stripped of his dominions by Jugurtha and besieged in Cirta, where he was killed by Jugurtha in 112 BC, although he had placed himself under the protection of the Romans.

François Joseph Lagrange-Chancel&#x27;s 1694 French play &quot;Adherbal, King of Numidia&quot; is based on his story.

<text>The Battle of the Aegates was a naval battle fought on 10 March 241 BC between the fleets of Carthage and Rome during the First Punic War. It took place among the Aegates Islands, off the western coast of the island of Sicily. The Carthaginians were commanded by Hanno, and the Romans were under the overall authority of Gaius Lutatius Catulus, but Quintus Valerius Falto commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.

The Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle, the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines.

As a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the Treaty of Lutatius, by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial reparations. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

==Primary sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( – 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.

Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius&#x27;s account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising &quot;The Histories&quot; deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that &quot;Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable&quot;; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;. Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that &quot;Polybius&#x27; account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;.

Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme &quot;Olympias&quot;. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.

==Background==
===Operations in Sicily===

In 264 BC, the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River Arno had recently been unified under Roman control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). More broadly both sides wished to control Syracuse, the most powerful city-state on Sicily.

===Ships===

During this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the quinquereme, meaning &quot;five-oared&quot;. The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 tonnes (110 short tons; 100 long tons). The galley expert John Coates suggested that they could maintain for extended periods. The modern replica galley &quot;Olympias&quot; has achieved speeds of and cruised at for hours on end. Average speeds of were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week.

Vessels were built as cataphract, or &quot;protected&quot;, ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and catapults. They had a separate &quot;oar box&quot; attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers. The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets – or files – of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.
The Romans had little prior naval experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small squadrons provided by their Latin or Greek allies. In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for &quot;warship&quot; in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines; if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.

Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. Rams were made individually by the lost-wax method so as to fit immovably to a galley&#x27;s prow, and secured with bronze spikes. Ideally one would attack an enemy ship from its side or rear, thus avoiding the possibility of being rammed oneself. Skill was required to collide with an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one&#x27;s own ram inextricably in the sinking enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship-on-ship combats which have been likened to aerial dogfights.

===264–250 BC===

Largely because of the Romans&#x27; invention of the , a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae (260 BC), Sulci (257 BC), Ecnomus (256 BC) and Cape Hermaeum (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the may have contributed to this disaster. In any event, they did not use the thereafter. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of Lilybaeum with 200 warships.

The Carthaginians regained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories over the blockading Roman fleet at Drepana and Phintias. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years. The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission most of her navy. Goldsworthy states that the Carthaginian navy became inactive and considers it likely that few ships were kept in commission. Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily. The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the native Numidians. Hanno the Great was put in charge of operations in Africa in 248 BC and went on to conquer considerable territory by 241 BC. The historian Nigel Bagnall considers that during this period Carthage viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.

==Prelude==
By 248 BC, the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome had gained control of most of Sicily and the Carthaginians retained only two cities on the island: Lilybaeum and Drepana; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.

When Hamilcar Barca took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed combined arms tactics in a Fabian strategy from his base at Eryx, north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage&#x27;s foothold in Sicily.

Early in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcementseither 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sourcesand a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry. The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.

By 243 BC, after more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted. Evidence of Carthage&#x27;s financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-talent loan from Ptolemaic Egypt, which was refused. Rome was also close to bankruptcy and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the legions, had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.

==New Roman fleet==

In late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Roman Senate decided to build a new fleet. With the state&#x27;s coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome&#x27;s wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the reparations to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense. The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian. By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes. Importantly, the was abandoned, which improved the ships&#x27; speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.

The new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus, assisted by the praetor Quintus Valerius Falto, led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability. Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became proconsul and propraetor respectively.

The garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepanaand Hamilcar&#x27;s army at Eryxheld fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.

==Battle==
The Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named Hanno; he is distinguished from other Carthaginians named Hanno by being known as the son of Hannibal. This is possibly the general who had lost the Battles of Agrigentum and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command. The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a following wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.

The Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade. He took a full complement of soldiers from the besieging Roman army to act as marines on board his 200 quinqueremes. The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa (modern Favignana), from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way. Hanno immediately set sail. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Lilybaeum, Drepana and Hamilcar&#x27;s army at Eryx. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle. He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions. Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.
The opposing fleets met to the west of the island of Phorbantia (modern Levanzo). Many fragments of lead anchors have been recovered from near the island of Levanzo, causing the archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa to speculate that the Roman fleet paused here and that its ships then deliberately cut their anchors, to reduce the weight they carried (each anchor weighed .). The Romans formed a single line of ships and rowed into the wind, through a heavy swell, towards the Carthaginians. Having little choice, the Carthaginians lowered their sails and engaged.

In the ensuing battle the Romans enjoyed far greater mobility, since their vessels were carrying only the bare necessities, while the Carthaginians were burdened with the equipment necessary for sustained travel and provisions for the Sicilian garrisons. The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar&#x27;s soldiers. It was the second time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the the first time, at the Battle of Drepana, they were badly beaten but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships&#x27; greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. The Roman ships were a match for their opponents, modelled as they were on one of the best of the Carthaginians&#x27;, and their crews were superior. The Romans sank 50 Carthaginian ships, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with 10,000 men. However, the battle was hard-fought, and the Romans lost 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; as the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore, they were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified.

==Aftermath==
Catulus was granted a triumph to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph. To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to Juturna in the Campus Martius, in the area of Rome currently known as the Largo di Torre Argentina.

After achieving this decisive victory over the Carthaginian fleet, Catulus continued the land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum, Eryx and Drepana; which continued to be defended by Hamilcar Barca and his army. The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned. Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and request terms. Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, Gisco. The Treaty of Lutatius was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents over ten years.

Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built over 1,000 galleys during the war; and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome&#x27;s maritime dominance for 600 years.

==Marine archaeology==
Since 2010, 19 (24, as of August 2022) bronze warship rams have been found by archaeologists in the sea off the west coast of Sicily. Ten bronze helmets and hundreds of amphorae have also been found. The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a number of fragments, have since been recovered. Inscriptions allowed four of the rams to be identified as coming from Roman-built ships, one from a Carthaginian vessel, with the origins of the others being unknown. It is possible that some of the Roman-built vessels had been captured by the Carthaginians earlier in the war and were crewed by them when they were sunk. It is believed that the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed. 

Six of the helmets were of the Montefortino type typically used by the legions, three with one or both bronze cheek pieces still attached; the seventh, badly corroded, was of a different design and may be Carthaginian. The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius&#x27;s account of where the battle took place. Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe that they all came from triremes, contrary to Polybius&#x27;s account of all of the warships involved being quinqueremes. However, they believe that the many amphora identified confirm that the Carthaginian ships were laden with supplies.

<text>Spaghetti Junction, officially the Gravelly Hill Interchange, is a major road junction in Birmingham, England. It is junction 6 of the M6 motorway where it meets the A38(M) Aston Expressway in the Gravelly Hill area of Birmingham. The interchange was opened on 24 May 1972.

== Background ==
The asymmetrical junction provides access to and from the A38 (Tyburn Road), A38(M) (Aston Expressway), the A5127 (Lichfield Road/Gravelly Hill), and several unclassified local roads. It covers , serves 18 routes and includes of slip roads, but only of the M6 itself. Across five different levels, it has 559 concrete columns, reaching up to . The engineers had to elevate of motorway to accommodate two railway lines, three canals and two rivers.

In 1958, the Ministry of Transport commissioned the engineering firm Sir Owen Williams &amp; Partners to investigate possible routes to connect the M6, the A38(M) and the A38 trunk road.

The interchange&#x27;s colloquial name, &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, was coined in 1965 by journalists from the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot;. On 1 June 1965, reporter Roy Smith described plans for the then unbuilt junction as a &quot;cross between a plate of spaghetti and an unsuccessful attempt at a Staffordshire knot&quot; and sub-editor Alan Eaglesfield headlined the article &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;. The name would later be given to other complex road junctions around the world. The student magazine of Birmingham City University, &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, took its name from the interchange&#x27;s nickname, before being rebranded as &quot;Polygon&quot;.

== Construction ==
The development of the interchange was approved and announced in August 1968 by the then Minister of Transport, Richard Marsh. Construction was expected to take three years and to cost £8m. The contract was given to A. Monk Ltd, of Padgate, for £8,183,790 in August 1968. Work started in September 1968 on the 30-acre junction. Monk were also building part of the M3.

The work was led by chief engineer Roy Foot. There were a number of objections and protests over the interchange, particularly a campaign to &quot;save our fish&quot; to relocate a quarter of a million fish from a pool that would be removed as part of the engineering work. One stipulation in construction was that the canal towpaths running underneath the junction need to retain sufficient clearance to allow the passage of horse-drawn narrowboats. Work was mostly complete by May 1970, and attracted attention of local residents. By the following September, several motorists were found to have been driving illegally along it, and children had found it a useful shortcut to school. In early 1972, Viking Motors ran a return service from Burton-on-Trent to the interchange for 65p return.

The junction was opened on 24 May 1972 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Peter Walker. The opening was delayed by several months because of &quot;box girder inspections&quot;. These followed the interim report of the Merrison Enquiry set up following the collapse of similar box girder bridges in Australia and Wales. Birmingham City Council saw the junction as a potential opportunity to attract visitors to the city, and proposed a Grand Prix involving the interchange.

The junction has undergone major repair work several times since, owing to the very heavy traffic through the junction and cost-saving measures during its construction. In November 2007, a slip road running from the Tyburn Road onto the Aston Expressway was closed for urgent repairs. Upon inspection, it was found that Spaghetti Junction itself was in need of repair, because salt and grit had weakened the joints in the structure. By 2009, it was estimated that 1.25 billion vehicles had travelled through the junction, and although structural defects had been found, the overall structure was stable enough to continue carrying traffic.

South-east of the junction, the M6 is on the elevated Bromford Viaduct – the longest viaduct in the UK.

==Co-located junctions==

Underneath the motorway junction are the meeting points of local roads, the River Tame&#x27;s confluences with the River Rea and Hockley Brook, the Cross-City and Walsall railway lines and Salford Junction, where the Grand Union Canal, Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and Tame Valley Canal meet.

==Cultural references==
Gravelly Hill Interchange appears in the 1973 Cliff Richard musical film &quot;Take Me High&quot;, where he plays a banker living on a barge on Gas Street Basin. Ken Dodd called the junction &quot;the eighth wonder of the world&quot;, because &quot;you get on and wonder how to get off&quot;.

The National Lottery-based show &quot;Winning Lines&quot; featured a trip to Spaghetti Junction as a booby prize.

In 2022, for the 50th anniversary of the opening of Spaghetti Junction, Heinz released a limited edition of their tinned spaghetti featuring the interchange on the tin.

The under side of Spaghetti Junction was used for the homeless camp/stacks in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;.

<doc id="468685" wikidata="Q453853" url="?curid=468685" title="Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina">
<text>Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina (lived 3rd century BC) was a Roman general and statesman who fought in the First Punic War.

Scipio Asina belonged to the patrician family of the Cornelii Scipiones. He was son of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus and brother of Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC). His son was Publius Cornelius Scipio Asina, consul in 221 BC.
Elected consul for the year 260 BC with Gaius Duillius, Scipio Asina had the honour of commanding the first Roman fleet launched onto the Mediterranean Sea.

While patrolling the waters of the Messina strait between Italy and Sicily, Scipio Asina received the information that Lipara, in the Lipari Islands, was about to change to the Roman side. Eager to secure such an important port and to gain glory for himself, he rushed to the islands without considering security. It is unclear if the Carthaginians planned the whole affair, but the Roman fleet was trapped in the harbor by Hannibal Gisco. Without naval warfare experience, the crews panicked and escaped to land, leaving the ships unattended and Scipio Asina to be made prisoner by the Carthaginians. Later, Gnaeus Cornelius was released from captivity, but it is unknown when and under what circumstances this happened. Apparently, the Romans did not see any particular guilt on the part of Scipio Asina in the defeat at Lipari. This is how historiography explains the fact that in 254 BC Gnaeus Cornelius became consul for the second time. Although there was hardly any fighting, the encounter is known as the Battle of the Lipari Islands.

His mishap earned him the pejorative surname &quot;Asina&quot; (&quot;ass&quot;, literally &quot;female donkey&quot;, in Latin), given by political opponents. Neither the humiliation, nor his loss, ended his career; in 254 BC, Scipio Asina was elected consul for the second time and, with his co-consul Aulus Atilius Caiatinus, succeeded in the conquest of Panormus (Palermo, now capital of Sicily).

<text>The Union Buildings () form the official seat of the South African Government and also house the offices of the President of South Africa. The imposing buildings are located in Pretoria, atop Meintjeskop at the northern end of Arcadia, close to historic Church Square. The large gardens of the Buildings are nestled between Government Avenue, Vermeulen Street East, Church Street, the R104 and Blackwood Street. Fairview Avenue is a closed road through which only officials can enter the Union Buildings. Though not in the centre of Pretoria, the Union Buildings occupy the highest point of Pretoria, and constitute a South African national heritage site.

The Buildings are one of the centres of political life in South Africa; &quot;The Buildings&quot; and &quot;Arcadia&quot; have become metonyms for the South African government. It has become an iconic landmark of Pretoria and South Africa in general, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of democracy.

The Buildings are the location of presidential inaugurations.

==Architecture==

These buildings, built from light sandstone, were designed by the architect Sir Herbert Baker in the English monumental style and are 285 m long. They have a semi-circular shape, with the two wings at the sides, this serves to represent the union of a formerly divided people. The clock chimes are identical to those of Big Ben in London. The east and west wings, as well as the twin-domed towers, represent two languages, English and Afrikaans, and the inner court was designed and built to symbolise the Union of South Africa. These buildings are considered by many to be the architect&#x27;s greatest achievement and a South African architectural masterpiece. The Nelson Mandela statue in Sandton City&#x27;s Nelson Mandela Square was commissioned originally to stand on the spot where Nelson Mandela gave his inaugural address.

The building was sited on a disused quarry, which now makes up the amphitheatre. The matching statues on top of the domed towers are Atlas, holding up the world, sculpted by Abraham Broadbent. The statue on the domed rostrum in the amphitheatre between the wings is Mercury, a mythic Roman messenger and a god of trade, sculpted by George Ness. The closest suburb to the Union Buildings is Arcadia, which means &quot;Playground of Gods&quot;. Pretoria has the second largest number of embassies in the world, after Washington, D.C., most of which are located in or near Arcadia.

The design of each level differs, and therefore each stone had to be individually cut. The Architectural styles of the building ranges from the lower levels&#x27; Edwardian style to the top levels&#x27; Cape Dutch design with shutters on the windows. The windows from bottom to top are elongated and become shorter towards the top floor. This is to give the illusion of height.

The Union Buildings are the site of presidential inaugurations. The official offices of the president are on the left-hand side of the Union Buildings, and the South African national flag is flown on the left-hand side if the president is in office.

The Buildings are divided into three sections; the left offices, amphitheatre, and right offices. All are 95 metres in length. Each offices block contains three inner courtyards providing light and air to the offices. Each block has a basement and three floors above ground. The central curved building behind the colonnade houses the committee rooms, a library and conference rooms while the basement contains the kitchen, dining rooms and lounges.

The interior is treated in the Cape Dutch style: carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture.

==History==

The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the Orange Free State were united with the Cape Colony and Natal Colony in 1910 to become the Union of South Africa. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal, superseding Potchefstroom in that role. The new Union required a governmental building which could signify unity and host the new government.

Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, later to become first president of the Transvaal Republic, was the original owner of the farm &#x27;Elandsfontein&#x27; on which Meintjieskop stands. In 1856 Andries Francois du Toit (1813–1883), in exchange for a Basotho pony, acquired part of the farm, which he named &#x27;&quot;Arcadia&quot;&#x27; and on which the Union Buildings were later constructed. He was also Pretoria&#x27;s first magistrate and was responsible for the layout of the city. During this period he sold his land to Stephanus Jacobus Meintjies (1819–1887), after whom the hill is named.

In 1909 Herbert Baker was commissioned to design the Government Building of the Union of South Africa (which was formed on 31 May 1910) in Pretoria. Pretoria was to become the administrative centre for the new government. In November 1910 the cornerstone of the Union Building was laid.

Lord Selborne and Henry Charles Hull, a member of the first Union Cabinet, chose Meintjieskop as the site for Baker&#x27;s design. The site was that of a disused quarry and the existing excavations were used to create the amphitheatre, which was set about with ornamental pools, fountains, sculptures, balustrades, and trees.

The design consisted of two identical wings, joined by a semi-circular colonnade forming the backdrop of the amphitheatre. The colonnade was terminated on either side by a tower. Each wing had a basement and three floors above ground. The interiors were created in the Cape Dutch style with carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture. Baker used indigenous materials as far as possible. The granite was quarried on site while Buiskop sandstone was used for the courtyards. Stinkwood and Rhodesian teak were used for timber and wood panelling. The roof tiles and quarry tiles for the floors were made in Vereeniging.

The cornerstone was laid in November 1910, shortly after the Union of South Africa – for which the buildings are named – was formed. Taking 1,265 workers over three years to build, the structure was completed in 1913 at a total cost of £1,310,640 for the building and £350,000 for the site.

Designed by Sir Herbert Baker in 1908, building began in 1909 and was completed in 1913. It took approximately 1,265 artisans, workmen and labourers almost three years to construct, using 14 million bricks for the interior office walls, of freestone, of concrete, 40 000 bags of cement and of granite.

Originally built to house the entire Public Service for the Union of South Africa, it was then the largest building in the country and possibly the largest building work undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere at that time.

Several other sites were considered, including Muckleneuk Ridge, on the opposite side of the city, and Pretorius Square, in the centre of Pretoria, where the City Hall now stands. However, Herbert Baker was strongly in favour of Meintjieskop, which was within 1.6 kikometres of the centre of Pretoria and reminded him strongly of some of the acropolises of Greece and Asia Minor, where he had studied Mediterranean architecture.

The concept of an acropolis and a building that agreed with renowned British Architect Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s theory that a public building should be a national ornament which establishes a nation, draws people and commerce and makes people love their country easily persuaded the then powers that be, who were at the time, preoccupied with the ideal of establishing a new and united nation.

The British high commissioner at the time, Lord Selborne, remarked;
People will come from all over the world to wonder at the beauty of the site and to admire the forethought and courage of the men who selected it.

The design of the buildings was largely determined by the nature of the site. Baker envisaged identical wings of rectangular office blocks, each representing one of the two official languages. They were to be linked by a semicircular wing, and the space in-between the two wings was levelled to bring form an amphitheatre as in the Greek fashion for gatherings of national and ceremonial importance.

Baker wanted the buildings to be built of imported granite, but any idea of using anything but South African stone for the most important government building of the new state was unthinkable to those who commissioned it, as a result, the terraces and retaining walls in the grounds are built predominantly of mountain stone quarried on site, the foundation of the building is of granite, while freestone was used for the exterior walls, the amphitheatre and major courtyards.

For the overall design of the building, Baker chose the neo-classic architecture of the Italian Renaissance, and also combined an idiom of the English Renaissance, as well as significant elements of Cape Dutch detail, such as in the carved main doorways and fanlights and in much of the wrought-iron brass work and balustrades of the smaller areas.

===Historical events===
On 9 August 1956, 20,000 women marched to the doors of the Union Buildings, chanting &quot;Wathint&#x27; Abafazi, wathint&#x27; imbokodo!&quot; which means &quot;strike the women, strike the rock&quot;, to protest against the pass laws of 1950. This historical event is commemorated by the public holiday National Women&#x27;s Day.

Wilma Cruise and Marcus Holmes were approached to design a memorial to commemorate the Women&#x27;s March. They made use of the &quot;imbokodo&quot;. The imbokodo is a grinding stone used by the women to grind maize. Cruise and Holmes, rested the imbokodo, representing nurture and sustenance, on bronze plates, representing the earth and fire. There are two sets of stairs leading to the memorial. On each step, raised in bronze letters are the words from &#x27;The Demand of the Women of South Africa for the Withdrawal of Passes for Women and Repeal of the Pass Laws.&#x27; On approaching the imbokodo, visitors trigger infrared beams, which activates history&#x27;s &quot;whispered voices&quot;, echoed in all 11 official languages, the rally cry, repeated softly.

In 1986, significant restoration of the Union Buildings was undertaken by Johan de Ridder and T.W. Baker as the appointed architects.

On 10 May 1994, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, South Africa&#x27;s first democratically elected president after the end of Apartheid, and his vice-presidents, heralded the beginning of a new era in South Africa&#x27;s history.

Part of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s inaugural address:

&quot;Today, all of us do, by our presence here, and by our celebrations in other parts of our country and the world, confer glory and hope to newborn liberty.

Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.

Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity&#x27;s belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.

All this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the world who are so well represented here today.
We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom.

We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success.

We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world.

Let there be justice for all.

Let there be peace for all.

Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.

Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves.

Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.

Let freedom reign.

The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement!

Let us as a Rainbow nation keep this in focus and move forward!&quot; 

On 31 December 1999 the South African flagship Millennium celebration was held here. In attendance was the then deputy president Jacob Zuma, and other ministers.

On 10 December 2013, the Union Buildings Amphitheatre was renamed the Nelson Mandela Amphitheatre.

On 16 December 2013, a 9-metre high bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at the Union Buildings.

==Gardens and grounds==

The building is surrounded by beautifully terraced gardens of indigenous plants. Various monuments adorn the expansive lawns, including the Delville Wood War Memorial and a statue of the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister, General The Rt Hon. Louis Botha.
The lawn in front of the Union Buildings are often the location for public gatherings, whether they be protest or celebration, such as the presidential inauguration.

Notable are the terraced gardens, planted exclusively with indigenous plants, surrounding the buildings as well as the 9,000 seat Nelson Mandela amphitheatre.

===Statues and memorials===
Within the grounds are various monuments, statues and memorials. Starting at the bottom of the gardens, a large statue of General Louis Botha (first prime minister of the Union of South Africa) on horseback dominates the lawn.
About halfway up the terraces, the Delville Wood War Memorial is a tribute to South African troops who died during the First World War as well as a plaque in memory of those that died during the Korean War.

Two levels above that is a statue of President Nelson Mandela. This replaced the statue of General J.B.M. Hertzog, a former Prime Minister, which can still be found on the grounds.

The South African Police Memorial is located at the top right of the gardens.

The South African National Film, Video and Sound Archives is also located in the grounds of the Union Buildings, adjacent to the Police Memorial.

==Laws governing the buildings==
Because of the significance of the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings in the national consciousness, a law in Pretoria limits the height of any building between the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings such that the view between them remains unobstructed.

==Powers and duties==
The Union Buildings share duties with Cape Town as the seat of the South African Government. Pretoria shares duties with Cape Town and Bloemfontein as the capital cities of South Africa.

The official seats of the President are the Union Buildings in Pretoria and the Tuynhuys in Cape Town.

<text>Gardner Island is a largely ice-free island which lies about 3 km west of Broad Peninsula in the southern Vestfold Hills, in Prydz Bay on the Ingrid Christensen Coast of Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica. It has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports about 27,000 breeding pairs of Adélie penguins. Snow petrels also breed on the island. The nearest permanent research station is Australia&#x27;s Davis Station, 3 km to the east on Broad Peninsula.

<doc id="468692" wikidata="Q389156" url="?curid=468692" title="Alban Berg Quartett">
<text>The Alban Berg Quartett (ABQ) was a string quartet founded in Vienna, named after the composer Alban Berg. Active from 1970 to 2008, the group included first violinist Günter Pichler and cellist Valentin Erben, while the second violinist was briefly Klaus Maetzl (1971–1978) and Gerhard Schulz from then onwards. The violist changed the most, Hatto Beyerle, Thomas Kakuska and Isabel Charisius.

==History==
The Berg Quartet was founded in 1970 by four young professors of the Vienna Academy of Music, and made its debut in the Vienna Konzerthaus in autumn 1971. The widow of the composer Alban Berg, Helene, attended an early private concert after which she gave her consent for the quartet to use her husband&#x27;s name.

The Quartet&#x27;s repertoire was centered on the Viennese classics, but with a serious emphasis on 20th-century classical music. It was the stated goal of the quartet to include at least one modern work in each performance. Their repertoire spanned from Early Classicism, Romanticism, to the Second Viennese School (Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern), Béla Bartók and embraced many contemporary composers. This took expression not the least in personal statements by composers like Witold Lutosławski and Luciano Berio, of whom the former said: &quot;Personally I am indebted to the Alban Berg Quartet for an unforgettable event. Last year in Vienna, they played my quartet in a way such as will never be likely equaled.&quot;

Following an invitation of Walter Levin (founder of the LaSalle Quartet) the ABQ studied intensively for the better part of a year in the USA. The focus of their activities in Europe became annual concert cycles at the Wiener Konzerthaus, at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Frankfurt Alte Oper, the Théâtre des Champs Elysées in Paris, the Philharmonic Hall in Cologne, the Zurich Opera, as well as regular concerts at most major halls and venues around the world (among them La Scala, Concertgebow Amsterdam, Berliner Philharmonie, Carnegie Hall, Teatro Colón, Suntory Hall, etc.) and all the major music festivals such as the Berliner Festwochen, the Edinburgh Festival, IRCAM in the Pompidou Centre, the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, and the Salzburg Festival. The ABQ is an Honorary Member of the Wiener Konzerthaus and Associate Artist of the Royal Festival Hall London.

From 1993 until 2012, the members of the Alban Berg Quartet were lecturing at the Cologne Conservatory in succession of the Amadeus Quartet. Quartets who studied with the Alban Berg Quartet include the Cuarteto Casals, the Schumann Quartett, the Amber Quartet (China), the Fauré Quartet, the Aviv Quartet, the , the Amaryllis Quartet, and in particular the Belcea Quartet, and the Artemis Quartet.

The composers that wrote string quartets for the Alban Berg Quartet include, in chronological order, , Erich Urbanner (Quartets Nos. 1 and 4), Roman Haubenstock-Ramati (Quartets Nos. 1 and 2), Gottfried von Einem (Quartet No. 1), Wolfgang Rihm (Quartet No. 4 and &quot;Requiem for Thomas&quot;), Alfred Schnittke (Quartet No. 4), Zbigniew Bargielski (&quot;Les temps ardente&quot;), Luciano Berio (&quot;Notturno&quot;), and Kurt Schwertsik (&quot;Adieu Satie&quot;).

In 2005, Thomas Kakuska died of cancer. In accordance with his wish, the ABQ continued performing with Isabel Charisius, a student of his. But as cellist Valentin Erben said, &quot;There was a big rupture in our hearts&quot; and the quartet retired in 2008. The concert in memoriam Thomas Kakuska in the Wiener Konzerthaus&#x27; Großer Saal featured a who&#x27;s-who of classical music, including an orchestra of friends and students of the quartet. Among them were Angelika Kirchschlager, Elisabeth Leonskaja, Irvine Arditti, Magdalena Kožená, Thomas Quasthoff, Helmut Deutsch, Alois Posch, Heinrich Schiff, and Sir Simon Rattle; the orchestra was conducted by Claudio Abbado. After a worldwide farewell tour in July 2008, the ABQ ended its career.

==Recordings==
Recordings were an important part of the work of the Alban Berg Quartet. Among the most famous recordings projects are the complete string quartets by Beethoven (EMI, which has sold more than a million copies), Brahms (Teldec and EMI), the late Haydn (EMI), the late Mozart (Teldec and EMI) and the late Schubert (EMI), but their repertoire on disc stretched further to Mendelssohn, Schumann, Janácek, Stravinsky, Berg, Webern, Bartók, von Einem, Lutosławski, Rihm, Berio, Haubenstock-Ramati to Schnittke and beyond. Many of the latter, contemporary, composers wrote works specially dedicated to the ABQ. After EMI released a live recording of their 1985 Carnegie Hall debut, the quartet preferred making live recordings for the last 20 years of its existence. Among them was—following their original studio Beethoven cycle from the late 70s and early 80s—a new Beethoven String Quartet cycle recorded live at the Konzerthaus during the Vienna Festival in 1989 and released on CD, video, and DVD. The Alban Berg Quartet recorded chamber music with some of the finest soloists of their time, including the piano quintets of Robert Schumann (with Philippe Entremont), Schubert and Brahms (with Elisabeth Leonskaja) and Dvoràk (with Rudolf Buchbinder), the Schubert string quintet (with Heinrich Schiff), the Brahms clarinet quintet (with Sabine Meyer), and the Mozart piano quartets and the piano quintet arrangement of the concerto KV 414 (with Alfred Brendel). For their recordings, the ABQ received more than 30 international awards, among them the Grand Prix du Disque, the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis, the Japanese Grand Prix, the Edison Award, and the Gramophone Award. Beyond recording, the ABQ collaborated regularly with the likes of Maurizio Pollini, András Schiff, and Tabea Zimmermann.

<doc id="468698" wikidata="Q852774" url="?curid=468698" title="Al-Bahah Province">
<text>Al-Bahah Province ( &quot;&quot; ) is a province of Saudi Arabia. It is located in the southwestern part of the Hejazi region. It has an area of 9,921 km2, and a population of 339,174 (2022). Its capital is Al Bahah. The region includes Al-Baḥah City, Al-Mikhwah and Baljorashi. Baljorashi has a famous traditional market known as &quot;Sūq as-Sabt&quot; (), which translates to English as &quot;Saturday market&quot;. The Baljorashi market is very old and its exact age is unknown. Other cities in the region include Baljourashi, Al-Mikhwah, Rahwat Albar and Sabt Alalaya. Al-Baḥah region is the home of two Azd tribes, the Ghamid and the Zahran.

Four of the muscle hijackers - the operatives who would storm the cockpits and control the passengers - involved in the September 11 attacks were recruited from three towns in the Al-Bahah region.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;al-Baḥah&quot; (or &quot;Baḥah&quot; without &quot;al&quot; which is equivalent to &quot;the&quot; in English) has many meanings; it means water and the maximum of it, the courtyard of a house, the high and abundant palm tree. In tales it refers to an extremely deep bottomless well in al-Zafir fortress. It means &quot;open space&quot;, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;abundant palm tree&quot; and the &quot;midline of a road&quot;.

==Governors==
* Saud bin Abdulrahman bin Turki Al Sudairi (1962–1977)
* Ibrahim bin Abdulaziz Al Ibrahim (1977–1987)
* Muhammed bin Saud Al Saud (1987–2010)
* Mishari bin Saud bin Abdulaziz (28 August 2010 – 22 April 2017)
* Hussam bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (22 April 2017 – present)

==Geography==
Al-Baḥah is the name of the province as well its main city, situated in the northwestern part of Ghamed territory. The region is formed of mountains, hills, plains, valleys and desert stretches. This region is situated in the Hejaz, between longitudes 41/42 E and latitudes 19/20 N. The region covers an area about 36,000 km2.

===Major cities===
* Al Bahah
* Baljurashi
* Al-Mandaq
* Al-Mikhwah
* Al-Aqeeq

==Topography==
The region is divided by huge rocky steeps into two main sectors. To the west is a coastal plain, the Tihamah. To the east is the mountain range of al-&quot;As-Sarawat&quot; or the Sarat, with an elevation of above sea level.

==Population==
A genealogist has confirmed that the majority of the population of Al-Baḥah are descended from the Azad Shenou`a tribe which emigrated from the south of the Hejaz in the Arabian Peninsula, following some historical natural events.

Al-Azad is an Arab tribe which is divided into 24 tribes derived from four stocks: Azad Shenou`a, Azad Al Sarat, Azad Ghassan and Azad Aman. Al-Azad (or al-Assad the Lion) was the title given to Darda`e bin al-Ghot bin Nabt bin Malik bin Nassr al-Azad. Kaab bin al-Harith had seven children including Ghamed, who is Amr bin Abdullah bin Kaab. Zahran bin al-Harith had six children, including Abdullah bin Zahran who is the great grandfather of the Zahran tribe. The population of the region now is about 500,000. Many have moved to major metropolitan areas for better living and education.

==Climate==
The variation in topography influences the climate of the region. Al-Sarat area is exposed to the formation of clouds and fog, and this often happens in winter because of air masses coming from the Red Sea, accompanied by thunderstorms. In spring and summer the climate is mild and pleasant. The climate in the area of the Tihamah is different from that in Al-Sarat, although they are separated by no more than . The Tihama is an undulating coastal plain, hot in summer, warm in spring and mild in winter. The climate in general falls in the arid zone. Relative humidity varies between 52% and 67%, with maximum temperatures of , and minimum temperatures of .

<doc id="468702" wikidata="Q1471266" url="?curid=468702" title="Al-Jawf Province">
<text>Al-Jawf Province ( Minṭaqat al-Jawf pronounced [alˈdʒoːf]), also spelled Al-Jouf, is one of the provinces of Saudi Arabia, located in the north of the country, partially bordered by Jordan to the west. It is one of the earliest inhabited regions of Arabian Peninsula, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Stone Age and the Acheulean tool culture. Human settlement continued unbroken throughout the Copper Age, a period that saw the kingdom of Qidar fight against the Assyrian state for its independence. It is also in this period that references to Arabs first appear in historical texts. A Christian kingdom later emerged under the rule of the Bani Kalb tribe and survived until the arrival of Islam and the Islamic conquest of Al-Jawf. Following the region&#x27;s Islamization it fell under the control of the Tayy tribe. Al-Jawf was incorporated into the third Saudi state at the time of its formation in 1932. In the 20th century the region was a site of conflict between the Al-Rashid family and the Al-Shaalan family, though it eventually came under the rule of King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud.

The Al-Jawf region is one of the most fertile regions in Saudi Arabia. The area around the town of Tabarjal is known as a national breadbasket due to the variety of crops grown there. Unlike most of the country, parts of Al-Jawf boast a moderate climate, fertile soil, and abundant groundwater, allowing for the unusually high levels of agricultural activity seen in the region. The province is famous for cultivating olive trees and is responsible for approximately 67% of the olive oil made in the Kingdom. Al-Jawf is also home to the widespread cultivation of palm trees and produces approximately 150,000 tons of dates every year.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Al-Jawf&quot; refers to land that has widened and collapsed into a broad cavity. The name is not unique in the Arabian Peninsula and is also used for Yemen&#x27;s Al Jawf Governorate. The word has been used to refer to locations in Yamamah and Diyar Saad. Other regions bearing the name Al-Jawf include the Jawf of Muammar in the Asir Region and Jawf Bani Hajir in Eastern Province.

The Al-Jawf region was formerly known as Jawf al-Amr and was inhabited by the Tayy tribe. It is also known as Jawf Al-Sirhan, which refers to a valley in the province that extends from the northwestern tip of the An Nafud desert to eastern Jordan. The word al-Jawf is used locally to refer to the city of Dumat al-Jandal.

== History ==
=== Pre-Islamic History ===
==== Prehistoric ====
Archaeological remains indicate that Al-Jawf has been inhabited since prehistoric times. A 1966 expedition to the Columns of Rajajil found numerous stone tools and pottery fractures that were used to date the site to the fourth millennium BC.

The Saudi Department of Antiquities and Museums discovered a site in 1977 near the center of Shuhitia dating to the Stone Age. In 1985, an archaeological team studying the ruins uncovered an additional 16 sites in the vicinity, with most of the locations dating to the Assyrian Early Period.

Al-Jawf has long held regional importance because of its strategic location on the Incense Road. The Assyrians considered the Kingdom of Qedar, whose capital of Dumat al-Jandal is located in Al-Jawf, to be a threat due to its hostility to Assyrian control. It was in this period that the first reference to the Arabs appears in the historical record on a monument built in 853 BC to memorialize of the Battle of Qarqar. The Qedarite Queen Zabibe is listed among the monarchs who had paid tribute to Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III.

Queen Samsi of Qedar later rebelled against Tiglath-Pileser III in alliance with the King of Damascus. Assyria suppressed the rebellion, killing 9,400 Qedarite warriors and capturing thousands of prisoners of war. Queen Samsi, realizing that the cause was lost, surrendered and declared obedience to the Assyrian monarchy. Tiglath-Pileser III restored her to the throne and appointed an emissary with an army of 10,000 men to monitor her.

Hostilities continued under the reign of Queen Yatie, who supported of the Chaldeans under Marduk-apla-iddina II in their successful defense of Babylon against an Assyrian army commanded by King Sennacherib. Queen Yatie also sent her brother to participate in the battle for the city of Kish in 703 BC.

Queen Yatie&#x27;s successor, Queen Te&#x27;el-hunu, was defeated by Sennacherib&#x27;s forces and retreated to Dumat al-Jandal in 688 BC. Sennacherib captured her there along with the Princess Tabua and transported them to Nineveh.

During the reign of the Assyrian King Esarhaddon the Qedarite King Hazael travelled to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh bearing gifts in an attempt to reacquire sacred relics taken by the Assyrians from Dumat al-Jandal. Esarhaddon accepted and appointed the Princess Tabua as Hazael&#x27;s co-regent. Yatia succeeded Hazael as King of Qedarites and was quickly met with a rebellion demanding independence from the Assyrians. The rebellion was ultimately suppressed by Assyrian forces.

King Yatia in turn rebelled against Esarhaddon while the latter was campaigning in Egypt against the Pharaoh Taharqa. Esarhaddon&#x27;s army defeated Yatia and once again seized sacred relics from the Qederites, though Yatia himself survived. Esarhaddon was succeeded by his son Ashurbanipal in 668 BC, and following Ashurbanipal&#x27;s ascension to the throne King Yatia travelled to Ninevah to request the return of the sacred relics and swear loyalty to the Assyrian state. Following the return of the relics, however, Yatia refused to pay tribute to Assyria and launched a revolt against Assyrian suzerainty. Ashurbanipal sent an army that crushed the uprising and forced Yatia into exile. Resistance to Assyrian power continued under Yatia&#x27;s successors King Amoladi and Queen Attia, who had also previously been married to Yatia. The new king launched a failed attack on the Assyrian state and was captured by King Kamish of Moab. Amoladi and Attia were taken to Nineveh where they were punished by Ashurbanipal.

Ashurbanipal then appointed Abb Yatia Bin Tari King of the Qedarites, but the move backfired as Abb Yatia backed Ashurbanipal&#x27;s older brother Shamash-shum-ukin when he launched a rebellion to usurp the throne in 652 BC. Abb Yatia failed to enter Babylon with his army and was routed by forces loyal to Ashurbanipal. After once again pleading fealty to the Assyrian crown he was allowed to remain King of Qedar. Abb Yatia rebelled once again with the support of the former Qedari King Yatia bin Hazael. This time, however, Ashurbanipal launched a major campaign against the Kingdom of Qedar, definitively ending the Qedarite resistance.

==== Post-Assyrian ====
The Assyrian Empire ceased to function shortly after the sack of Ninevah in 612 BC. It was replaced as the regional power in Al-Jawf by the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which at least initially led to a period of relative peace. This period of peace lasted until Nabonidus rose to power in 556 BC and sought to occupy several areas to the south of Al-Jawf including Tayma, Lihyan, Khaybar, and Medina. While the specifics are not entirely clear, it is possible that the Qedarite Kingdom cooperated with Nabonidus in his conquest of the Kingdom of Tayma. The Neo-Babylonian Empire collapsed and Nabonidus&#x27; reign was terminated when Babylon was captured by the Achaemenid King Cyrus the Great in 539 BC.

The Kingdom of Qedar came to rule a large area in the second half of the fifth century BC including southern Palestine, the Sinai Peninsula, the southern regions of eastern Jordan, and parts of the Hejaz. Both the Bible and Herodotus record that the Qederite Geshem the Arabian feuded with Nehemiah over whether to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem in 445 BC. Silver vessels have been uncovered near Pithom that bear the name of the Qederite King Qinu ibn Geshem, the king of Qidar, who is believed to be the son of Geshem the Arabian.

References to the Qedarites start to be replaced in the historical record with references to the Nabataeans following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Gaza in 332 BC. The Nabataean Kingdom seized control of the regional incense trade in this period. In 106 AD, the last Nabataean King Rabbel II died and the Nabataean Kingdom was conquered by the Roman Emperor Trajan and turned into Arabia Petraea.

The former Qaderite capital of Dumat al-Jandal continued to serve as a major regional urban center into the Byzantine era and was home to a major marketplace. Following Byzantine rule Al-Jawf came under the control of the Kalb tribe and then the Kingdom of Kinda.

=== Islamic history ===
Muhammad invaded al-Jawf twice as part of his Arab conquests between 622 and 632. Following the second conquest led by Muslim leader Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf the region converted to Islam.

When Abu Bakr became caliph in 632 he launched the Ridda wars against rebel Arab tribes in a number of regions, including Al-Jawf. In 633 a Rashidun Army under Khalid ibn al-Walid persecuted rebels in the region following al-Walid&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ayn al-Tamr. He successfully captured and occupied Dumat al-Jandal before retreating back to Al-Hirah.

Imru Al Qais bin Al Asbagh Al Kalbi ruled the region during the reign of the Caliph Umar between 634 and 644. Marwan bin Al Hakam ruled Al-Jawf during the reign of the Caliph Uthman in the 640s and 650s.

The Tayy tribe became dominant in the Al-Jawf region during the 10th century. The Al-Fadl family from the Tayy tribe ruled the area between the 12th and 14th centuries. The Tayy began raiding Al-Shami, a location on the Egyptian Hajj route, in the 16th century. In 1521 the Ottoman Empire agreed to pay the Tayy tribe to cease their attacks on the Hajj route.

Al-Jawf was incorporated into the first Saudi state in 1793 during the reign of Imam Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad. The incorporation of the region was not achieved peacefully; Imam Muhammad sent an army to the Al Jawf that conquered three towns, killed many local civilians, and besieged the major population centers until they pledged allegiance to the Saudi state. During the reign of Imam Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, which lasted from 1803 to 1814, the area remained under Saudi control.

In the mid-19th century the region became part of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, which was ruled by the Rashidi dynasty and nominally affiliated with the second Saudi state. In 1838 Abdullah bin Ali Al Rashid sent an army of 3,000 men led by his brother Ubaid to attack al-Jawf and collect zakat, but the region was not formally conquered at that time. In 1853 Talal bin Abdullah Al Rashid sent another army to Al-Jawf that conquered and incorporated the region within Jabal Shammar over the course of a two-year campaign.

=== Modern history ===
Muhsin al-Shaalan, Nuri Al Shalaan&#x27;s cousin, ceded the Qurayyat (Qurayyat al-Salt) region, which is the last remaining part of the al-Jawf region, and he ceded it in favor of the Saudi state. Ibn Battah was appointed a follower of Abdullah al-Tamimi, the emir of al-Jawf, The Emirate of Transjordan, however, rejected this. It saw that it was more deserving to rule the Qurayyat region, so it escalates with the Saudi state by demanding of establish a neutral zone between the two countries, the withdrawal of the Saudis from the Hijaz, and the return of the Al-Rashid family in Hail and the family of Al-Ayed in Asir to authority. This was rejected by Saudi state. As a reaction of that, Saudi forces crawled over the Jordanian villages until they reached Yadodah, a few miles away from the city of Amman. At that time Britain intervened by bombing the Saudi forces and forcing them to withdraw and return to the dialogue. Which was the case so the Saudi state agreed with Britain, which represents East Jordan, to give the Qurayyat region to Saudi Arabia and protect Saudi trade with Syria. That agreement was known as the Hada agreement. After the annexation of the Hijaz, the Qurayyat region was known as the &quot;Emirate of Qurayyat and the Northern Border Inspectorate.&quot; At the end of 1931, King Abdulaziz appointed governor for the second time Turki bin Ahmed Al-Sudairy a prince on Al-Jouf, and he moved the capital from Dumat al-Jandal to Sakaka. One of the most important events that passed on Al-Jouf during this period is the protection of Sultan al-Atrash, the leader of the Great Syrian Revolution in Al-Jouf region from 1927 to 1932 ..

In the year 1358 AH, governmental departments in the Qurayyat region moved from the village of Kaf to the village of Nabak (which later became known as the City of Qurayyat). In 1957 Tabarjal was established after a part of the Shararat tribe settled in the region. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan which was known as the Amman Agreement in 1965 to delineate the borders in the north of the Hijaz and confirm the previous agreement. In 1991, the zoning system was issued during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and the Qurayyat region merged with the Jawf region and Tabuk region. The system also resulted in the formation of the District Council, which consists of 33 members, twenty of whom are residents of the region, and the rest are state employees.

== Population ==
Population growth in the Al-Jouf region is generally high, with a population of 520,737 people, according to the report of the General Authority for Statistics for the year (2018). [58] [59]

==== Desert ====
The Great Nafud desert is located in the Al-Jouf region, which was previously known as Sand Alaj. It extends from Al-Jouf in its west to Hail in the east, and its area is approximately 64,630 km2.

==== Lows ====
There are many short and large valleys in the region, but the most famous one is the Sirhan Valley. It is the most important valley of Al-Jouf, its length is 180 km, and it has an importance in agriculture in the region. There are several other important valleys such as Wadi Fajr and its length is 135 km. It flows into the Valley of Sirhan, Wadi Al-Ayli is the largest of Harra Al-Harra and one of Siran valleys. There are also other valleys, such as: Wadi Al-Shuhatiyah, Wadi Al-Merir, Wadi Hasida, Wadi Baar, Wadi Al-Safa, Wadi Hadraj, Wadi Al-Moi, and Wadi Al-Bayer.

Other than the valleys, there are Khabara (Swamps). The most famous one is Khabara Al-Amhas, which is a land where rainwater collects, some plants grow in, and is located in the desert of Hammad. There also are many Sabkhas. The most popular is Sabkah Hadhodha, which is located near Al-Issawiya and covers an area of 540 km2, thus making it the largest Sabkhas of the kingdom&#x27;s.

Al-Jouf is also famous for Dumat al-Jandal Lake, and it is 585 meters above sea level, with an area of one million and one hundred thousand square meters.

==== Climate ====
Al-Jawf region falls within the semi-tropical high pressure belt, which makes wind an influence in the region. In the winter, the arid northeast winds blow, making Al Jouf&#x27;s weather stable and cool in this season. The astronomical location of the region may cause the development of air fronts as a result of the collision of the arid northeast winds with the humid southwest winds, causing Precipitation. The maritime impact on the region is limited because the geographical location of the Jawf is far from the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Gulf, and the winds through which it does not help in the rains. The Mediterranean is the sea that most affects the region.

The region is one of the coldest regions in Saudi Arabia during winter. Temperature reaches only 15 Celsius during the day in January, it drops to two degrees in the evening, and it may reach below zero. In summer, temperatures reach 40 degrees Celsius in late July, and at night it drops to 19 degrees in the north of the region and 23 in the south. High and low temperatures adversely affect the region in water loss, plant wilt or frost formation and damage to agricultural crops.

Rain falls in the region mostly between October and May in the fall and winter seasons, and it decreases during the rest of the year. The average annual rainfall is about 80 mm. The rains are fluctuating, falling one year significantly, but little in another year. In general, however, when it is raining accompanied by the formation of hail, strong wind, thunderstorms, and torrential torrents. This fluctuation and changing factors are detrimental to the region and its agricultural economy.
== Administrative Divisions ==
The region is divided into the emirate&#x27;s headquarters located in Sakaka Governorate, two (type A) governorates, the Qurayyat Governorate, and the Duma al-Jandal, and one (B) Governorate, Tabarjal. These governorates are divided into centers affiliated with them. The number of centers in the Al-Jouf region is 33 centers distributed among the four governorates. These centers are:
=== List of governors ===
Since annexation of the region to rule the third Saudi state, several princes have ruled it, including Turki bin Ahmed Al Sudairi, who ruled for two different periods, and they are:
=== The princes of the Qurayyat region ===
Nine princes have followed over the Qurayyat region from the time Muhsin al-Sha’lan abdicated it until her annexation to the Al-Jawf region, and they are: [47] [89]
== Public services ==

=== Transportation ===
The region is connected with the capital Riyadh by a 1309 km long road that passes from the city of Sakaka and reaches the city of Arar. It is also linked to the city of Jeddah (on the Red Sea coast) through the city of Dumat al-Jandal and the city of Madinah by a road with a length of 1258 km. Furthermore, the provincial centers in the region are connected to each other. There are two airports in the region: The first is in the city of Sakaka is known as the Al-Jouf Domestic Airport(AJF / OESK), and the other airport is in Qurayyat and is known as the Gurayat Domestic Airport (URY / OEGT). It is planned that the region will also be linked with the rest of the Kingdom by a network of railways within the North-South Train (SAR), which links the capital Riyadh with the cities of Sakakah, Qurayyat, Haditha and the Basita farms.

The distance between the emirate&#x27;s headquarters in Sakaka city and the different cities of the Kingdom in kilometers (km):
=== Education ===
Like other regions of the Kingdom, education was limited at the beginning to the Kuttab in mosques where the Qur&#x27;an and the Arabic language are taught, and wood planks and tamarix sticks are used for writing. In the year 1362 AH, the first regular school in the area, the Emiri School in Sakaka, was opened, and it includes one class and one teacher. In 1364 AH, the Omar bin al-Khattab School was opened in the city of Dumat al-Jandal, and then opening formal schools has continued.

In the year 1369 AH, the Al-Jouf region with the Qurayyat and Tabuk regions submitted a request to King Abdulaziz to grant a financial reward to each student, and the king agreed. Later, with the increase in the number of schools, the task of supervising them was assigned to the education of the Madinah region, then to the education of Dammam. In the year 1377 AH, the Central Inspection Office was established to link between Al-Jouf and Dammam. In the year 1388 AH, the Central Inspection Office turned into a special &quot;education office&quot; in the region, then to an &quot;Educational Supervision Bureau&quot; and finally in the year 1398 AH to an &quot;Education Administration.&quot;

The first school for girls was opened in the region in the year 1382 AH. and in the year 1401AH, the College of Education for Girls arose. In the next year, the Health Institute for Nursing was established, and the &quot;Girls &#x27;Education Commission&quot; became an independent department in the name of &quot;the Department of Girls&#x27; Education in Al-Jouf&quot;. The following year the Boys&#x27; Health Institute was established, and in 1423 AH, the College of Science for Boys was established. In the year 1426 AH, Al-Jouf University was opened.

=== Healthcare ===
The central hospital in Sakaka (Abdel Rahman Al-Sudairy Hospital) was built in the year 1385 AH (1965 AD) to be the first hospital in the region, and this hospital was specialized in chest diseases due to the spread of tuberculosis in the region. With the increasing population need for hospitals, King Faisal Hospital in Qurayyat, the Diagnostic and Obstetric Center in Dumat al-Jandal, and the Ambulance and Obstetrics Center in Tabarja were established in the year 1395 AH. In 1404 AH, the Mental Health Hospital was established, The General Hospital was opened in Qurayyat in 1405 AH. On the first of Rajab 1406 AH, the Health Affairs Department was established Al-Jouf after it was affiliated with the Health Affairs Directorate of the Northern Health in the city of Arar, In 1425 AH Seven hospitals and 29 health centers were affiliated with the Health Affairs Department. In the following year, the Sawyer General Hospital was established, and in 1433 AH, the Abu Ajram General Hospital was established.

== Economy and natural resources ==

=== Agriculture ===
Formerly, agriculture is considered the basic profession of the region&#x27;s residents. Backpackers have described agricultural crops in Al-Jouf as they pass through it. Among those who referred to the agricultural crops is the Finnish backpacker George August Wallin (Yrjö Aukusti Wallin) who mentioned that palm trees, figs, apricots, oranges and grapes are planted in the region. This is what also was indicated by the William Palgrave adding that dates are the only crop that It is sold outside the region. In the modern era, Abdul Rahman bin Ahmed Al-Sudairy, the governor of Al-Jawf region, mentioned that olives, apples, pears, pomegranates, wheat and barley are grown in the region. The Guinness Book records that the largest modern olive farm in the world is also found in Al-Jouf.

Agricultural machines were brought to the region in the year 1368 AH. Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture was established in the year 1379 AH. Then the emirate distributed agricultural lands to citizens. The number of distributed farms reaching 7,500. The region is now famous for cultivating an olive tree, and it produces 67% of olive oil in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Olive trees began to be planted in 1392 AH. In 1437 AH (2016 AD), the number of olive trees reached 18 million trees producing between 30 and 40 thousand tons of olives and 10 thousand tons of olive oil. The number of olive presses reached 23 presses.

In addition to olives, there are 10 million fruit trees in Al-Jouf annually producing 170 thousand tons. Also, there are 1.2 million palm trees annually producing 40 thousand tons of dates, the most famous of which is Hilwah Al-Jouf. The number of Al-Jouf farms is 12 thousand farms and 3 thousand agricultural projects that contain 30 million trees that produces olives, palms, fruits, vegetables, and fodder.

Among the most important problems facing agriculture is the problem of depleting groundwater with the increasing number of agricultural projects, especially in the Basita Farms Project and the cultivated areas, where the cultivated area reached 428 thousand hectares.

=== Livestock ===
In 1402 AH, corresponding to 1982 AD (the former name of the ministry at the time), the Ministry of Agriculture and Water started the project of the rangeland development center and improved it to preserve livestock in the Al-Jawf region in cooperation with FAO. The center included several departments working on rangeland management, soil conservation, production management and animal health. The National Wildlife Protection and Development Authority has established several reserves to protect the region&#x27;s animals and planets.

According to the statistics of 1426 AH corresponding to 2005 AD, Al-Jouf Region included 1,569,733 heads of sheep, 1,740 heads of cows, 7,398 heads of camels, 88,845 heads of goats, and 2,791,227 poultry. The region included 6 projects for raising chickens, 4 projects to produce eggs, and 3 projects specialized in breeding and fattening lamb.

=== Industry ===
Before the establishment of the Saudi state, the industry in the region was handcrafted products, such as: leather industry, such as horse belts, arms sheaths and water closures, weaving industries such as cages, utensils, baskets and fans, wooden industries such as doors and some agricultural tools, stone industries such as the millstone, the grind and the mortar, and woolen industries such as sleeping mats, carpets and the abaya. The industry before the year 1390 AH (1970 AD) was very limited, but it was increasing. Several industrial workshops were opened which numbered in the year 1418 AH nearly 200 workshops, and the number of factories reached 20 factories in the year that followed and their investments amounted to 112 million riyals at the time. Investment rose up to 220 million riyals in the year 1425 AH (2004 AD). 12 factories specialized in the food and beverage industry, then 4 factories for the chemical and plastic industries, and 4 factories for the building materials, ceramics and glass industries.

The industrial contribution in the region is limited, so that the number of factories in the region represents only 0.53% of the factories in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The number of their workers represents only 0.23% of the number of workers in other factories, and the invested capital represents only 0.08% of the invested capital in the rest of the factories. Industrial projects in the region are mostly individual projects with limited funding. all of them are national in the absence of foreign investment. Most industrial activity is limited to the food and beverage industry, depending on wealth and potential in the region.

=== Minerals ===
The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (now called the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources) has conducted exploratory and prospecting studies for the region. Consequently, the presence of many raw materials was determined, such as: clay in the areas of Jal Ajrabeh and Al Dhailiya, which is used in the manufacture of building materials. Silica sand is found in the areas of Al-Malih and Al-Luja and on the extension of the Tabuk road, southeast Sakaka. Silica is used in the manufacture of glass, and it exists in its forms of quartz, opal, and chalcedony. In the region, there are also basalt rocks found in Hurra Al Hurra, and enter in the manufacture of Pozzolan cement. The region also contains limestone rocks found in Wadi Al Hablah and western Jabal Al Abd, dolomite rocks along the Sakaka Arar road, the mineral phosphate found in Hurra Al Hurra, and salt found in Wadi Al-Sarhan, Hadhodhaa, Kaf, and Etherh.

=== Trade ===
In the past, trade in the region depended on the system of bartering and the exchange of goods according to the needs of the individual. The region suffered in the year 1356 AH (1937 AD) and until the year 1365 AH (1945 AD) for two reasons, namely the lack of imports due to the weak financial resources of the population, and the Second World War that caused an economic crisis to a number of countries in the world.

With the development of the state and the emergence of chambers of commerce, increasing records and licenses, securing basic life necessities and developing income sources among the population as a result of development, the number of markets, commercial complexes, individual institutions and companies has increased, which numbered 6191 institutions and companies in the Al-Jouf region. Among the most important commercial activities in the region in the commercial sector are wholesale and retail trade in foodstuffs, electrical and sanitary ware, fabrics and clothing.

Because of its geographical location in the northwest of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, A large portion of land trade passes through a Al-Hadithah port, one of the most important commercial outlets for the Kingdom, and it is one of the largest and most important outlets in the Middle East region linking the Gulf Cooperation Council states with Jordan, the countries of the Levant, Egypt and Turkey, the destination to the countries European. The region has a branch of the Ministry of Trade and Investment that issues licenses to companies and institutions, combats commercial fraud, conforms to specifications, and monitors markets to protect consumers.

== Wildlife ==

=== Vegetable cover ===
The vegetation is weak in many locations. The most important plants that form the cover are: Lavender, Ziziphus, Opophytum, Truffles, Malva, Plantago ovata, Maha, Erodium, Artemisia, Achillea, Pulicaria, Asafoetida, chrysanthemum, Haloxylon, Haloxylon persicum, Calligonum, Tamarix, Rhanterium epapposum, Neurada procumbens, Atriplex, Salsola, Anisosciadium, Lepidium, Diplotaxis, Papaver dubium, Erucaria, Hippocrepis unisiliquosa, Sonchus, Anchusa, Tragopogon, Scorzonera, Allium sindjarense, Leek, Chamomile, Clover, Thyme, Anemone, Stipagrostis, Retama, Lycium shawii and Aloysia.

=== Animal life ===

==== Mammals ====
Desert and mountain environment in Al – Jouf contributed to the existence of many mammals. In the region, there are five species of the order of even – numbered Hoof namely the Arabian oryx, and Goitered gazelle, Ghazal junction, Dorcas gazelle, and Nubian ibex. These species are deemed one of the rarest species in the region due to excessive hunting that they were exposed to in the twentieth century which led to their disappearance from all or most of their natural habitats. There are also seven species of the order of Carnivores, Arabian wolf, Rüppell&#x27;s fox, Red fox, Honey badger, Striped hyena, Sand cat, and a wild cat. Numbers of these species are constantly decreasing because they are considered a threat to livestock and Badia residents. Finally, in the area, there are ten species belonging to four order of insectivora, desert hedgehog from erinaceidae order, Cape hare from lagomorpha order, Rock hyrax from Aleupreat order, and finally Rodents order, which 7 types belong to it, they are Cheesman&#x27;s gerbil, Wagner&#x27;s gerbil, Libyan rat, Sundoval rat, Lesser Egyptian jerboa, Euphrates jerboa, and Porcupine.

=== Birds ===
The first person who wrote about the birds of the region was John Philby in the year 1923. The most important thing, he mentioned was that the Arabian ostrich, which was raised in Dumat al-Jandal and was found naturally in Wadi Al-Sarhan. Studies in the area have continued to register birds, there was Richard Minershagen&#x27;s study in 1954, Arthur Green&#x27;s study in 1983, a study by the National Wildlife Service, then a study by British bird scientist Michael Jennings in 1995. The Harra Al Hurra and Dumat Al Jandal Lake are the two most important regions in Al Jawf for birds; first provides protection for birds due to the difficulty in accessing and hunting people, and the second is a wet area where birds visit. During the surveys in the 1990s, more than 10 thousand birds were registered in Winter. Birds in Al-Jouf suffer from overfishing, the disappearance of natural areas, and their vulnerability to unregulated human consumption of groundwater. Although many birds live in the region, and it is considered a transit area for birds in their migration, yet only 170 migratory species have been registered there.

==== Reptiles ====
In Al-Jawf region, there is one of the four orders of reptiles, which is the order of the Squamata. There specifically is the existence of Twenty-two species of Lizards, and nine types of Snakes. Most of these species are found in good numbers in their natural habitats, but the Uromastyx aegyptia may face the risk of extinction due to the overfishing that it is exposed to. In addition to that, Elegant racer, Egyptian catsnake, and Desert black snakes are found in small numbers in their original habitat. For Jan&#x27;s Cliff Racer, its numbers are medium in its places of spread

==== Arthropods ====
The Kingdom&#x27;s environment is rich in many types of Arthropods, and many of them live in the Al-Jawf region. These types are classified in several classes such as arachnid and have several s such as Spiders, Solifugaes, Scorpions, and Acari. There are also other classes such as Centipede. There is in Al-Jouf only one type is Scolopendra (known locally as the mother of the forty-four). Also, there is insects class, and many belong t o it such as cockroaches, Orthoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Beetles, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera order. These insects may be harmful to agricultural crops, disturbing people and most likely being gotten rid of.

== Culture and tourism ==

===Pre-Islamic Arabia===

There isn&#x27;t much information known about Al Qassim the province in the times of Pre-Islamic Arabia. Unaizah was repeatedly mentioned as a desert watering hole in the poems of Imru Al Qais (the famous Arabian poet). Moreover, AlJiwa, which is about 60 km north of Unaizah, was mentioned by the heroic Absi poet Antarah bin Shaddad.

===The Abbasid era===

Al Qassim Province had some important foyers on the road of pilgrims and traders coming from the east (mainly Persia and Iraq) in the era of the Abbasid Empire.

The Zubeida road was a long pilgrims road that started from the city of Kufa in Iraq and ran to Mecca in Arabia. The road was constructed in the reign of Harun Al-Rashid and was named after his wife Zubaidah. It had pilgrims foyers in many of the region&#x27;s cities including Unaizah.

===Tribal conflict (1600s–1907)===
The Al Abu Olayan - dynasty from the Banu Tamim tribe established the emirate of Buraydah in the late 16th century by its leader, Rashid Al Duraiby. He built Buraydah and made it the province&#x27;s capital. However, Unaizah was ruled by Al Sulaim dynasty from the Subay tribe. The emirate of Buraydah was later captured by Muhanna bin Salih bin Hussein Abaalkhail from the Anazzah tribe. In 1890, the Rashidi dynasty based in Ha&#x27;il annexed the province. In 1904, the Abaalkhail recaptured the province. In 1907, the province was integrated under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

=== Economy and Trade Era &quot;Al Aqilat (late 1850 and early 1900)&quot;===
They represent a civilized tribes and families from Najd, specifically from Al Qassim in Saudi Arabia. Among most important families of the Aqilat are “Aba Alkhail, Al Rumaih, Al Arfaj, Al Sugair, Al Rebdi, Al Fuzan Alsabig, Al Jarbou, Al Otaishan, Al Rawaf, Al Bati, Al Musalam, Al Sharidah, Al Assaf and Al Tuwajiri”. They were famous for trading primarily gold, horses especially Arabian horses, camels, clothing and food from across Arabian Peninsula. They traded in Kuwait, Iraq, Sham &quot;now known Jordan, Syria&quot; and others. This nickname was unique because of their distinctiveness in wearing the Aqal and their unique uniforms from the rest of the people. they were deeply known around the people of the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world for their courage, generosity, honesty and patience over the hardships of distant travels, as they had a great impact in flourishing of economics and business around the region. They have known as they are heroes of Arabian region as they were first ambassador of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. As the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, said that Al Aqilat are the best and first ambassadors to the Arabian nations in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Moreover, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz praised the men of Al Aqilat, as he said that they were the first to bring trade to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

<text>Interstate 215 (I-215) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. It has portions designated as the Barstow, Escondido, and Armed Forces Freeways. I-215 is a bypass auxiliary route of I-15, running from Murrieta to northern San Bernardino. While I-215 connects the city centers of both Riverside and San Bernardino, its parent I-15 runs to the west through Corona and Ontario.

Part of I-215 was once signed as Interstate 15E (I-15E), but this was changed in 1974 as almost all of the Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of I-215 is at the junction of I-15 in the city of Murrieta, in southwestern Riverside County. It then runs north through Menifee and northwest through Perris, passing March Air Reserve Base before joining State Route 60 (SR 60) in Riverside, near the Moreno Valley city limits. From just north of downtown Perris to eastern Riverside near the Central Avenue interchange, the tracks of Metrolink&#x27;s 91/Perris Valley Line run along the freeway.

I-215 overlaps with SR 60 for about in Riverside while passing through the campus of UC Riverside and splits from it at SR 91 near downtown Riverside. It then travels north through Colton, Grand Terrace, and San Bernardino before turning northwest and rejoining I-15 near the small San Bernardino neighborhood of Devore.

This route is an alternative to I-15 for drivers traveling from Phoenix, Las Vegas, or San Bernardino, to the San Diego metropolitan area. This route offers a slight distance advantage as an alternative to I-15&#x27;s alignment about to the west of (and roughly parallel to) I-215. The distance between the two I-15/I-215 junctions is almost shorter using I-215 rather than I-15.

However, the traffic and time &quot;advantage&quot; on I-215 is limited by three factors: the segment between the I-15/I-215 &quot;Devore junction&quot; and north of SR 210 in San Bernardino only has two lanes in each direction (while I-15 has four), its co-designation with SR 60 and routing through Riverside requires motorists in both directions to &quot;change freeways&quot; to remain on I-215, and that most of I-215 has a speed limit (except for a short segment in northern San Bernardino north of Palm Avenue, which has a speed limit).

I-215 is also used by local residents as the major north–south route for the urbanized portions of the San Bernardino–Riverside–Ontario metropolitan area. (I-15 serves a similar function in the western portion of the metropolitan area; the two are the only continuous north–south freeways in the area.)

I-215 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. I-215 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. On January 24, 1957, the State Highway Commission defined the Escondido Freeway as what is now Routes 15 and 215 from Route 805 to Route 91. This entire segment was previously Route 395 when it was named. From the SR 60 / SR 91 interchange in Riverside to I-10 near San Bernardino, the highway is known as the Riverside Freeway. From I-10 to SR 210, I-215 is known as the San Bernardino Freeway. Between Highland Avenue in San Bernardino and its northern terminus, I-215 is named the Barstow Freeway. Unofficially, I-215 is known as the Armed Forces Freeway between I-15 and SR 60, given its proximity to the March Air Reserve Base.

==History==

The highway (not an Interstate) that is currently I-215 first opened in 1963 as part of U.S. Route 395 (US 395). The &quot;mileposts&quot; in Riverside County reflect this since they do not start at zero at the I-15 interchange in Murrieta. Around 1968, US 395 was renumbered as I-15 (the original proposed route, as SR 71&#x27;s proposed number was I-15W / SR 31 Hamner-Milliken). This segment of US 395 was again renumbered in 1972 as (Temporary) I-15E. Next, in 1974, this route was renumbered as State Route 194. In 1982, this route was then renumbered as I-215 north of SR 60, and as State Route 215 south of SR 60. Once SR 215 was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards, it became part of I-215 in 1994. Prior to its upgrade to Interstate standards, there were traffic signals at SR 74, as well as at Alessandro Boulevard. Two railroad crossings had also intersected the I-215 expressway at SR 74 and south of Cactus Avenue at then–March Air Force Base.

Due to the fact that the I-215 designation was overlaid upon existing freeways between the southern junction with SR 60 and the city of San Bernardino, the SR 60 / SR 91 / I-215 interchange in the city of Riverside has been widely known for its confusing nature concerning the numbering of I-215. While SR 60 continues east-and-west through this interchange, and SR 91 continues southwest (and formerly to the north), the I-215 designation continues away from this interchange on SR 60 east and the former northern portion of SR 91 (now solely numbered I-215). Travelers following I-215 in either direction need to &quot;change freeways&quot; at this interchange, instead of just following through lanes. The interchange was reconstructed to include some high-speed flyovers, one of which carries I-215 southbound traffic. In addition, when I-215 temporarily cosigns SR 60 in Riverside, the mileposts for I-215 supersede mileposts for SR 60. Motorists traveling east–west on SR 60 must begin counting exits at a new number, in the reverse order, during the I-215 overlap.

===San Bernardino widening project===
A joint project between Caltrans and SANBAG of San Bernardino County to widen I-215 between Orange Show Road and University Parkway in San Bernardino began in 2007. With its completion, the project added one general use lane and one carpool lane in each direction, bringing the total number of lanes from six to 10 lanes across. The , $723 million expansion project included the reconstruction of all underpasses and overpasses within the project as well as connector ramps between I-215 and SR 210. The widening was completed in late 2013, and all construction signage and equipment were completely removed by spring of 2014.

*Phase 1: Reconstruction of 5th Street Bridge. Work began in January 2007 and was completed in November 2008, approximately six months ahead of schedule and $2 million under budget. The 5th Street bridge was built in phases with the new bridge being constructed alongside the old structure to allow for continuous use of the east/west corridor during construction.
*Phase 2: Freeway widening between Orange Show Road and Rialto Avenue. Construction began on Phase 2 in December 2007 and was completed in July 2010. In addition to the reconstruction of various bridges, the freeway was widened from three to five lanes in each direction through this stretch of road. Aesthetic wallscapes depict the City’s iconic symbols, including palm trees, the San Bernardino mountain range, fountains representing the local springs, and more.
*Phase 3: Freeway widening between Rialto Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue. Construction began in September 2009 and finished in mid-2013. This phase received $128 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds, one of the largest allocations of funding to a construction project in the country. As part of this phase, the freeway was widened from three to five lanes in each direction along with the reconstruction of various bridges and underpasses. Following construction completion, all fast-lane entrances and exits were eliminated with drivers using new 5th Street and Baseline Street onramps that connect directly to the newly constructed bridges. This new configuration provides more balanced access to the west and east sides of the city. Also, residents living alongside the northbound side of the freeway have a sound wall to help block out freeway noise.
*Phase 4: freeway widening between Massachusetts Avenue and University Parkway. Construction began in January 2010 and was completed in November 2012. A key feature in this phase was the construction of I-215 / SR 210 connector ramps. Drivers now have direct access to these freeways in all directions. In addition to a general-purpose and carpool lane added in each direction south of the I-215 / SR 210 interchange, a southbound auxiliary lane and a northbound general-purpose lane were added between University Parkway and the I-215 / SR 210 interchange.

==Future==

Many improvements are in the works along the entire length of the I-215 corridor. Several interchanges are planned to be built or reconstructed, such as the interchange at University Parkway in San Bernardino, which is planned to be converted into a diverging diamond interchange. Long-range plans include adding a carpool lane in each direction on a section of I-215 between Nuevo Road in Perris and SR 60 near Moreno Valley. There are also plans to connect I-215 at its southern terminus in Murrieta to a planned collector–distributor lane system on I-15 near the Temecula–Murrieta border, providing access to interchanges at French Valley Parkway and Winchester Road.

<text>The Eastern Province ( &#x27;), also known as theEastern Region, is the easternmost of the 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. It is the nation&#x27;s largest province by area and the third most populous after the Riyadh and Mecca provinces. In 2017, the population was 4,900,325. Of these, 3,140,362 were Saudi citizens and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals. The province accounts for 15.05% of the entire population of Saudi Arabia and is named for its geographical location relative to the rest of the kingdom.

More than a third of the population is concentrated in the Dammam metropolitan area. With an estimated population of 1.53 million as of 2022, Dammam, the capital of the province, is the fourth most populous city in the kingdom. The incumbent governor of the province is Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud. Other populous cities in the province include Hofuf, Mubarraz, Hafr al-Batin, Jubail and Khobar. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the Persian Gulf and proximity to the other countries of the eastern Arab world, such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long King Fahd Causeway. The region also shares a border with Oman, Yemen, Kuwait and Iraq. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the Northern Borders, Ha&#x27;il, Qassim, Riyadh and Najran.

The Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom&#x27;s oil production and exports. Oil was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The Ghawar oil field, located in the Ahsa Governorate, measuring 8,400 sq.km. (3,240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom&#x27;s oil production. The Safaniya oil field, located off the coast of the province, is the largest offshore oil field in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of Jubail, the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.

The region was home to the Dilmun civilization which was an ancient Semitic-speaking polity in Eastern Arabia. Founded in the late 4th millennium BC and lasting until approximately 538 BC it is regarded as one of the oldest civilizations in the world. Dilmun was an important and prosperous trading centre for millennia with well-developed and long-standing trading, commercial and cultural ties with nearby Mesopotamia in particular and the Indus Valley civilisation.
A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout Island on the coast.

==Geography==

Approximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising, from south to north, the Rub&#x27; al Khali, Dahna and Nafud deserts, with the Rub&#x27; al-Khali alone making up more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as Hafr al-Batin and the Ahsa Oasis have become important sites for desert farming due to the advancements made during the Green Revolution in farming and irrigation techniques.

The entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Yemen.

==History==

The Eastern Province was home to the Dilmun civilization for several millennia which was an important trading center from the late fourth millennium BC to 800 BC. At the height of its power, Dilmun controlled the Persian Gulf trading routes. Dilmun was very prosperous during the first 300 years of the second millennium.

The Dilmun civilization was the centre of commercial activities linking traditional agriculture of the land—then utterly fertile due to artesian wells that have dried since, and due to a much wetter climate—with maritime trade between diverse regions such as the Meluhha (suspected to be Indus Valley Civilisation), Magan (Oman), and Mesopotamia. The Dilmun civilization is mentioned first in Sumerian cuneiform clay tablets dated to the late third millennium BC, found in the temple of goddess Inanna, in the city of Uruk. 
One of the earliest inscriptions mentioning Dilmun is that of king Ur-Nanshe of Lagash () found in a door-socket: &quot;The ships of Dilmun brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands.&quot;

The great commercial and trading connections between Mesopotamia and Dilmun were strong and profound to the point where Dilmun was a central figure to the Sumerian creation myth. Dilmun was described in the saga of Enki and Ninhursag as pre-existing in paradisiacal state, where predators don&#x27;t kill, pain and diseases are absent, and people do not get old.
Likewise the Sumerian tale of the garden paradise of Dilmun may have been an inspiration for the Garden of Eden story.

Dilmun&#x27;s commercial power began to decline between 1000 BC and 800 BC because piracy flourished in the Persian Gulf. The most recent reference to Dilmun came during the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Neo-Babylonian administrative records, dated 567 BC, stated that Dilmun was controlled by the king of Babylon. The name of Dilmun fell from use after the collapse of Babylon in 538 BC.
The northern part of the Eastern Province later became inhabited by the Arab Lakhmids around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the Sasanians but governed by the Lakhmids. The entire Arabian Peninsula fell into Muslim hands during the Rashidun Caliphate and the Muslim conquest of Persia, after Muhammad&#x27;s death. The region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates. 
During the Abbasid Caliphate, the region was taken over by the Qarmatians, a Shi&#x27;ite group of the Isma&#x27;ili branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked Makkah and Madinah in 930 AD and held the Black Stone to ransom in Ain Al Kuayba, Qatif. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the Ahsa Oasis, to which Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the Uyunid Emirate.

Not much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the Banu Abdul Qays tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the Jabrids took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s.

In 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their first war with the Safavids, and kept it under their control until 1671. After several years of unrest between the Ottomans, Saudis and Rashidis, the Emirate of Nejd and Hasa, also known as the Third Saudi State, under Ibn Saud, took the entire Arabian Peninsula from Ottoman and Rashidi control. Most of the Eastern Province came under the Hasa region, and as such, the emirate has been under Saudi control since 1902. In 1923, the Dawasir of Bahrain moved into the area which is now Khobar, and later spread into Dammam, and they are credited with the foundation of the two cities.

In the early 1990s, during the First Gulf war, Iraqi troops crossed the Kuwaiti-Saudi border and seized the town of Khafji. The US and Saudi Arabian armies were able to kick them out. This was known as the Battle of Khafji.

==Demographics==
=== Population ===
According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority for Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals. The Eastern Province is the third most populous province in Saudi Arabia, after Makkah and Riyadh. With an estimated population of 1,225,000 as of 2019, Dammam is the most populous city in the province and the sixth most populous city in the country. The governorate with the largest population is the Ahsa Governorate. It is also the largest governorate in terms of land area. The province had the lowest dependency ratio in the kingdom at around 36%, as of 2016. The sex ratio for Saudis was 109 males per 100 females and 150 males per 100 females for non-Saudis, yielding a common sex ratio of 151 males per 100 females. 1% of children in the province were orphans.

===Religion===
Sunni traveler, Ibn Battuta (1304 - 1369 A.D.) mentioned: &quot;Then we traveled to the city of Al-Qatif, its name is derived from fruit picking, which is an oasis of water and a large city with many palm trees inhabited by Shiite Arabs.&quot;

The local Saudi population is entirely Muslim, with the majority being Sunni Muslims. Shia constitute a large minority, concentrated especially in Qatif and Ahsa governorates.

===Languages===
The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic. The standard spoken dialect in the Eastern Province is a variant of Najdi Arabic, similar to the urban Najdi spoken in Riyadh, but influenced by other dialects local to the Eastern Province. Other dialects spoken natively in the Eastern Province include:
# Gulf Arabic dialects, spoken by approximately 2 million people, including Hasawi variants, Bahraini variants, and others.
# Baharna dialects spoken in Qatif.
# Najdi-type dialects spoken among settled bedouin tribes. This includes Central Najdi dialects such as the dialects of Bani Khalid, Southern dialects such as the dialects of Al Murrah and Ajman, and Mixed Northern-Central Najdi dialects such as dialects of Al-Dhafeer.

There are also many dialects spoken by Saudis who have immigrated from elsewhere, such as other Najdi dialects, South Arabian dialects, and Hejazi dialects. The Mehri language is also spoken by Mehri Saudis. Saudi Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf community.

The large expatriate communities also speak their own languages, the most numerous of which are some of the Indian languages, Filipino/Tagalog, Bengali, Urdu, as well as Arabic dialects such as Egyptian, Levantine, and Yemeni.

==Governors==
==Economy==

The economy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is largely dependent on oil. As such, the Eastern Province, being the province with most of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s oil reserves enjoys a high economic position. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia and an organization of major significance in the petroleum industry, is based in Dhahran in Greater Dammam. It became the fifth company in the world to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) on December 11, 2019. After going public the same day in what is considered the largest public offering ever as of December 2019, the next day, on December 12, 2019, the company reached a market cap of $2 trillion, becoming the first and only company in the world to break the record. 

The kingdom&#x27;s main oil and gas fields are located in the Eastern Province with sites such as the Ghawar Field, the largest onshore oil field in the world and the Safaniya oil field, the largest offshore oil field in the world. Petroleum is refined in various refineries spread across the kingdom and shipped to dozens of countries from port cities such as Ra&#x27;s Tanura. The East–West pipeline enables efficient transport of oil from the eastern oil fields and refineries to the western refineries and ports, such as Rabigh and Jeddah.

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s largest agricultural product, dates, also forms a large part of the province&#x27;s economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oasis of Ahsa to be sold in and around the kingdom.

==Transportation==
Dammam&#x27;s King Fahd International Airport, operating since October 1999, the largest airport in the world in terms of land area, serves as the primary hub for the entirety of the Eastern Province. Located 30 km northwest of the city, the airport is well connected by air to 43 destinations in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, provided by 37 airlines. Other airports in the province include Ahsa International Airport and Qaisumah-Hafr Al Batin Airport. Saudi Aramco has a separate terminal at the King Fahd International Airport for their employees and aircraft with scheduled flights to Shaybah, Yanbu, Jeddah and other sites where the company is active.

Built in the 1940s, the King Abdulaziz Sea Port, located on the coast of the Persian Gulf, is the second largest and second busiest port in Saudi Arabia, after the Jeddah Islamic Port in Jeddah. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. The port is equipped with 9 ports with 214 platforms. The port receives more than 15,000 ships carrying more than 13 million containers or 532 million tons of cargo annually.

Highway 95 (Route 5M) connects Khafji on the Kuwaiti border in the north to the Ramlah border station on the Omani border in the south via Jubail, Ra&#x27;s Tanura, the Dammam metropolitan area, the Salwa border station on the Qatari border and the Batha&#x27; border station with the United Arab Emirates. Highway 40 (Route 80M) connects Bahrain and Dammam via the 25 km (15 mi) King Fahd Causeway over the Persian Gulf and onward to Jeddah on the Red Sea via Riyadh, Ta&#x27;if and Makkah. Highways 605, 610, 613, 614, 615, 617 and 619, known locally by other popular names, connect the Greater Dammam area to Ra&#x27;s Tanura, Jubail, the King Fahd International Airport, Abqaiq and Hofuf.

Intercity bus services are operated in the province by the Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO). Umrah and Hajj shuttle services are also provided to residents of the kingdom by private contractors. Shuttle services also connect the Dammam metropolitan area to the Bahrain International Airport, northeast of Manama in Bahrain.

The Saudi Arabian railways are managed by two separate organizations, the Saudi Railways Organization and Saudi Railway Company. The lines in the Eastern Province, two lines, one passenger, which runs from Dammam to Riyadh via Abqaiq an Hofuf, and the other freight, which runs directly from Dammam to Riyadh, are managed by the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO).

A plan to build a metro in Dammam was also in the works, but its current status is unknown.

==Administrative divisions==

The Eastern Province is one of the 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia (; &quot;manātiq idāriyya&quot;, sing. منطقة إدارية; &quot;mintaqah idāriyya&quot;). The region is further subdivided into 11 governorates (; &quot;muhāfazāt&quot;, sing. محافظة; &quot;muhāfazah&quot;). The governorates are further subdivided into sub-governorates (; &quot;marākiz&quot;, sing. مركز; &quot;markaz&quot;).

The Eastern Province&#x27;s capital city of Dammam has special status. Like the other 12 regional capitals, Dammam is not included within any governorate but is instead simply known as the City of Dammam, in Arabic, the word (&quot;amānah&quot;) is used and the city is headed by a mayor (; &quot;amīn&quot;). The Ahsa Governorate, which includes the traditional oasis of Ahsa and the Rub&#x27; al Khali desert, which comprises more than half of the governorate itself, is the largest governorate in Saudi Arabia in terms of area.

<text>Asir, officially the Asir Province, is a province in the southwest of Saudi Arabia, which is named after the ʿAsīr tribe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of 2,024,285 (in 2022). ʿAsīr is surrounded by Mecca Province to the north and west, Al-Bahah Province to the northwest, Riyadh Province to the northeast, Najran Province to the southeast, and Jazan Province and the Yemeni &quot;Muhafazah&quot; (Governorate) of Saada to the south.

Abha is the provincial capital, and other towns include Khamis Mushait, Bisha and Bareq. The regional governor is Turki ibn Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He replaced his cousin, Faisal bin Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, after being appointed on 27 December 2018.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;Asir&quot; remains a subject of debate among historians. One theory, proposed by Al-Masudi in his work &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot;, suggests that the region was originally known as the &quot;land of Azd&quot;.

Another popular hypothesis suggests that the name &quot;Asir&quot; derives from the Arabic term &quot;ʿUsrah&quot; (). This theory comes from the fact that the region&#x27;s terrain is rugged, which can be challenging to navigate.

A third perspective proposed by Fuad Hamza in his book &quot;Fi bilad ʿAseer&quot;, links the name to the historical prominence of Banu Asir. As the tribe gained power and influence, its name came to encompass the surrounding territories and tribes. This association was reinforced by the close ties between the Asir tribe and many of the ruling emirs in the region, including those from the Al Yazid, Al Muthami, and Al A&#x27;ad families.

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===
In 25 B.C., Aelius Gallus marched his legions south from Egypt on an expedition of , to take control of the ancient overland trade routes between the Mediterranean Sea and what is now Hadhramaut in Yemen. The Romans wanted control of those routes because they were desperate for money and hoped to raise some by capturing Ma&#x27;rib, capital of Sabaʾ, and taking control of the trade in incense – then a priceless commodity – and other valuable aromatics. As it turned out, however, the expedition was a disaster and little information about ʿAsir emerged.

=== Modern history ===
By 1920, however, Ibn Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, had begun to recoup the losses of the House of Saud, and to unify most of the peninsula under his rule. As part of this campaign, he sent his Bedouin warriors also known as the Ikhwan to occupy ʿAsir, and the ruler of the region, Hasan Al Idrissi, had to leave. Therefore, he asked for protection from Imam Yahya, the ruler of Yemen and went there. From then on ʿAsir has been controlled by the House of Saud, a situation formalized in 1934 with the signing of the Treaty of Taʾif between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Even then the region was still largely unknown to the West. In 1932, St John Philby, one of the first Europeans to explore and map the peninsula, did enter ʿAsir, but as he did not publish his observations until 1952, the area remained one of the blank spots on the world&#x27;s map. In 1935 ʿAsir was made a separate governorate.

==== Mass shootings of Ethiopian refugees ====
Since 2014 refugees are killed after crossing the Saudi border by the Saudi Border Guard. Since 2023 at least several hundred Ethiopian refugees have been killed at the border between Yemen and the provinces Jazan, Asir and Najran. The Saudis have also used explosive weapons.

== Economy ==
Historically, ʿAsir was known for producing coffee, wheat, alfalfa, barley, senna, and frankincense. Wheat was grown in the summer and sesame has been grown in wetter areas of the region. Straw was used to make mats, hats, and baskets. Tribes in the area also wove tents from straw.

=== Modern development projects ===
In 2019, the Saudi government launched an infrastructure development project in ʿAsir Region. The project is expected to cost more than 1 billion Saudi Riyals. The provided projects will include health care, transportation and municipal services. The project is in line with the Saudi Vision 2030 to diversify non-petroleum income and activate new resources in Saudi Arabia.

In 2023, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched Soudah Peaks Project to develop a tourism destination in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s highest peak, Jabal Soudah. Soudah Peaks is a planned luxury mountain tourism destination located at 3,015 meters above sea level.

== Geography ==
The ʿAsir Region is situated on a high plateau that receives more rainfall than the rest of the country and contains the country&#x27;s highest peaks, which rise to almost at Jabal Sawda near Abha. Though data is exceedingly sparse and unreliable, the average annual rainfall in the highlands probably ranges from . It falls in two rainy seasons, the chief one being in March and April, with some rain in the summer. Temperatures are very extreme, with diurnal temperature ranges in the highlands the greatest in the world. It is common for afternoon temperatures to be over , yet mornings can be extremely frosty and fog can cut visibility to near zero percent. As a result, there is much more natural vegetation in ʿAsir than in any other part of Saudi Arabia, with sheltered areas even containing areas of dense coniferous forests, though more exposed ridges still are very dry. ʿAsir is home to many farmers who chiefly grow wheat and fruit crops. Irrigation has greatly expanded production in modern times. Asir National Park was established in 1981, and extends from the Red Sea coast through the western foothills to the Asir escarpment.

<text>Ḥail Province ( &#x27;), also known as theHa&#x27;il Region, is one of the 13 provinces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is the eighth-largest province by area at and the ninth-largest by population, with the population in 2019 being 731,147. The province accounts for roughly 2% of the population of the country and is named for its largest city, Ha&#x27;il. Other populous cities in the province include Shinan and Baq&#x27;aa. The region is famous for the twin mountain ranges of &#x27;Aja and Salma, and for being the homeland of historic symbol of curiosity and generosity, Hatim al-Ta`i.

The province is popular for hosting the geographically and historically important &#x27;Aja and Salma Mountain Ranges, which now encompass the Jabal Aja Protected Area under the Saudi Wildlife Authority. In addition, multiple rock art sites can be found in the province, two sites of which have been added to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site List; Jabal Umm Sinman near Jubbah and Jabal al-Manjur. Multiple old forts and castles can be found in the region, especially in and around the capital, Ha&#x27;il. Another important site in the province are the sandstone formations, such as the Nafud al-Kabir formation.

The area is known to have been inhabited since at least the Paleolithic period, with several archaeological sites dating back to 10000 BCE to 7500 BCE. Several sites with archaeological rock art and other artifacts have been found in the province. The province is inhabited by members of the Shammar tribe, who ruled the area and other areas surrounding the province from 1791 to 1922 as the Emirate of Jabal Shammar; when King Abdulaziz conquered the region.

The province is divided into 8 governorates, and more than two-thirds of the population of the city lives in the capital city of Ha&#x27;il. The incumbent Provincial Governor is &#x27;Abdulaziz ibn Sa&#x27;ad al-Sa&#x27;ud. It is bordered, clockwise from the north, by the Northern Borders Province, Eastern Province, Qassim Province, Madinah Province, Tabuk Province and Al Jawf Province.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence indicates the continuation of human settlement in the Ha&#x27;il Province since prehistoric times. The sites dating to the Middle Paleolithic age discovered in and around Ha&#x27;il attest that the soil in the area could have held enough water to enable plant life during the period from 75000 BC to 5000 BC. A striking discovery in the province was that there are more archaeological sites dating back to the Paleolithic period than to the Neolithic. One reason given for this is that the climatic changes from a cold and humid climate in the Paleolithic period to the heat and drought of the Neolithic period and the resulting gradual change in vegetation cover from greenery to desertification led to mass migration to more habitable areas in the Fertile Crescent. Archaeologists have deduced that the availability of its water, the fertility of the soil, the abundance and distribution of pastures in different directions, and the moderate climate of the region, combined, made it a lot more hospitable than the surrounding Arabian Desert.

Neolithic sites are clearly scattered across the northern Arabian Peninsula. Several Neolithic artifacts found in the province date back to the period from 10000 BC to 7500 BC. The artifacts discovered in Hail can be distinguished from others found in Saudi Arabia by the abundance of rock drawings that vary between human and animal figures. The Neolithic period in Ha&#x27;il is distinguished by its different environments and diversity, as can be seen in the sandy banks of the valleys, the dune slopes and ancient lake deposits, including those discovered in Jubbah, northwest of Ha&#x27;il. Stone tools in separate areas of Ha&#x27;il also indicate that the people living in the area lived a life of hunting-gathering, rather than in permanent settlements.

Cultural evidence from the Copper Age (approximately 5500 BC) is most widespread within the Ha&#x27;il Province, and among the artifacts found in the area from this age are stone tools with flat sides in the form of scrapers, drills and cleavers. In addition to the discovery of a group of stone formations and circles that characterize the Copper Age, these stone installations indicate that life in this era was more settled than the life of hunting-gathering, which is a striking characteristic of a Neolithic society. Among the signs that prove these settlements are the presence of flint tools, vessels made of rough, unpolished clay and a group of rock inscriptions that together confirm the existence of human activity in the region in prehistoric times.

In May 2021, archaeologists announced that a 350,000-year-old Acheulean site named An Nasim in the Hail region could be the oldest human habitation site in northern Saudi Arabia. The site was first discovered in 2015 using remote sensing and palaeohydrological modelling. It contains paleolake deposits related with Middle Pleistocene materials. 354 artefacts, hand axes and stone tools, flakes discovered by researchers provided information about tool-making traditions of the earliest living man inhabited South-West Asia. Besides, Paleolithic artefacts are similar to material remains uncovered at the Acheulean sites in the Nefud Desert.

=== Up to and after the advent of Islam ===

Part of the historic Najd region was inhabited by Arab tribes and influenced by the Nabataean people and later, the Ghassanids and Lakhmids. This is supported by the discovery of 122 Thamudian texts dating back to the eighth and seventh centuries BC in the city of Jubbah, approximately north of Ha&#x27;il, which is the fourth archaeological site in the Kingdom to be put on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site List, in 2002.

By 633, under the rule of Abu Bakr, the Rashidun Caliphate consolidated the region. The Shammar tribe emerged to be the most powerful in the region in later years and by 1791, Prince Abdullah bin Ali al-Rasheed of the Shammar consolidated the region under his rule, whose state acted as a precursor to the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, which was formed in 1834 by the Rashidi dynasty. The Emirate of Jabal Shammar fought several wars against the new Saudi state to the south, supported by the Ottomans, but in 1921, King Abdulaziz of the House of Saud conquered its capital city, Ha&#x27;il, during the Unification of Saudi Arabia, and the region completely fell into Saudi hands by 1922.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
The 2017 Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the Saudi General Authority for Statistics observed the population of the province to be 699,774 (2.19% of the entire kingdom), with Saudis constituting approximately 77% of the population, at 530,944 individuals; making the province the ninth-most populous in the kingdom. United Nations projections estimate the 2020 population of the capital of the province, the city of Ha&#x27;il, at 400,000; more than two-thirds of the population of the province lives in the city and the Ha&#x27;il Governorate, in which Ha&#x27;il is located, is the province&#x27;s most populous governorate.

<text>Jazan Province, also spelled Jizan () is the second smallest (after Al-Bahah) province of Saudi Arabia. It stretches along the southern Red Sea coast, just north of Yemen. It covers an area of 13,457 km2 and had a population of 1,404,997 at the 2022 census. The region has the highest population density in the Kingdom. The capital is the city of Jazan; Prince Muhammad bin Nasser has been the Governor since April 2001.

The region includes over 100 islands in the Red Sea. Jazan Economic City is a mega project that is planned to boost the economy of the region and make it part of the Saudi economic growth. The Farasan Islands, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first conservation protected area, is home to migratory birds from Europe in winter.

==Geography==
The region divides into three parts.
* The Al-Sarawat mountains inland, which rise to about 3,000 metres.
* The Alhazoun forest district consists of forest broken by some areas of rich pasture.
* The plains are noted for the production of coffee beans, cereal grain crops (barley, millet and wheat) and fruit (apples, bananas, grapes, mangoes, papayas, plums and citrus varieties).

Though the climate on the highlands is similar to the relatively wetter climate of ʽAsir, the coastal regions of Jizan province are part of Tihamah, probably the hottest place in the country, with mean maximum temperatures ranging from 40 °C (104 °F) in July to 31 °C (88 °F) in January. High humidity from coastal lagoons makes the climate even less bearable than it would be otherwise. Rainfall is extremely low at less than 75 millimetres (3 inches) per year. 
Sabya is located in the center between the mountain and the beach.

== Population ==
==Sub-divisions==

The region is now sub-divided into 17 governorates (following the creation of the governorates of At-Tuwal from part of Samtah, Fayfa from part of Jizan, as follows:

== Ethnography ==

The Arabic language is spoken by over 90% of the inhabitants. Parts of Jizan was claimed to be part of a &quot;Greater Yemen&quot; by many Yemenis despite never being ruled from Yemen since the fall of the Himyarite Kingdom at 525 CE. Since that period, the areas of Jazan province has been mostly independent and it has also been part of the First Saudi state during the 18th century. Jazan has been annexed by Saudi Arabia in 1932 and was defended from a Yemeni invasion that lead to the Saudi–Yemeni War (1934) and Imam Yahya suspended Yemen&#x27;s claim to the region in the treaty of Taif. Though many Yemeni nationalists continued to claim Jizan until the issue was settled formally and finally in the Saudi-Yemeni border agreement of 2000.

== Environmental projects ==

In 2019, the Saudi Government allocated $213 million to implement water and environmental projects in the region. Such projects include, installing a sewage treatment line, sewage network, sewage connections for households, and a station for pumping.

== Border incidents involving Ethiopian migrants ==
Since 2014, in relation to the civil war in Yemen, there have been reports of alleged shooting of Ethiopian migrants illegally crossing the Saudi border by the Saudi Border Guard. Since 2023, at least several hundred Ethiopian migrants have been killed at the border between Yemen and the provinces Jazan, ʽAsir and Najran. The border guards allegedly also used explosive weapons.

== Abu Arish ==

Abu Arish is the capital and center of the Abu Arish Governorate in southwestern Saudi Arabia. It is situated to the east of the city of Jizan at the intersection of longitude 42.30 and latitude 16.30. The city of Abu Arish has been known since ancient times under the name Darb al-Naja. In the early seventh century AH, it served as the capital of Al-Mekhlaf Al-Sulaymani.

== History ==

Abu Arish is one of the historical cities known since the fourth century AH, as it is located on the pilgrims&#x27; route, and its origins and history can be recognized from the study of Al-Mekhlaf Al-Sulaymani by historian and writer Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Aqili. He stated that the area was initially inhabited by the Al-Hakami and Al-Jibril families and that it had been in existence for a much longer period of time, previously known as &quot;Darb al-Naja.&quot; The city is of strategic location due to its role as a transportation hub, connecting numerous governorates via a network of regional roads. It is situated at a pivotal point between Ahad al Masarihah Governorate in the south, Damad Governorate in the north, Al Aridhah Governorate in the east, and Jazan Emirate in the west.

=== Name ===
Abu Arish was previously known as Darb al-Naja. The name Abu Arish was derived from a man who came for pilgrimage and passed through the village of Abu Arish at that time. Upon his return, he again passed through the village. He built a pergola (Arish in Arabic) made of wood and straw to educate the village&#x27;s sons in the sciences of religion and jurisprudence. When visiting this jurist, one might say, &quot;I am going to Abu Arish,&quot; meaning the owner of the arish which is how the village got its name.

== Geography and demographics ==

Abu Arish is situated in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, to the east of Jizan, which serves as the administrative capital of the area.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Abu Arish is similar to that of the southwestern region of the Kingdom, as it is situated within this area. The climate is characterized by mild winters, with temperatures reaching 18 degrees Celsius, and a hot, humid summer, with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius. During the summer, monsoon winds and sandstorms are common, particularly in the afternoon and evening, and are called by the locals (Ghubra). On some days, the intensity of the winds increases, resulting in decreased visibility for several hours. This can lead to the formation of sand dunes, as well as irregular local winds that blow with great force for brief periods. These winds are characterized by high temperatures, low humidity, and the presence of sand and dust clouds.

=== Humidity ===
The humidity level is 50% in the area west of the Jizan Valley Dam and decreases as we head east.

=== Precipitation ===
The precipitation occurs during the late summer and early fall months and is characterized by irregular patterns. In some years, there are heavy rainfall events that support agricultural activities, and the dam captures a significant portion of these precipitation levels. Conversely, in other years, there are minimal rainfall events that are insufficient for agricultural production.

== Economy ==
The city of Abu Arish is distinguished by its geographical positioning, situated at the nexus of the region&#x27;s principal urban centers. The local population is predominantly engaged in agricultural and commercial activities, with the city market serving as a pivotal economic hub within the region. The weekly market day occurs on Wednesdays, during which traders engage in commercial activities involving both regional and external markets. These activities encompass the import and export of various products. Each profession had its own market, with a sheikh responsible for the affairs of its affiliates. As the region developed, traditional trade methods underwent a transformation, with the advent of new professions and the decline of older ones.

<text>The Mecca Province (, ), officially Makkah Province, is one of the 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. It is the third-largest province by area at and the most populous with a population of 8,557,766 as of 2017, of which 4,041,189 were foreign nationals and 4,516,577 were Saudis. It is located in the historic Hejaz region, and has an extended coastline on the Red Sea. Its capital is Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, and its largest city is Jeddah, which is Saudi Arabia&#x27;s main port city. The province accounts for 26.29% of the population of Saudi Arabia and is named after the Islamic holy city of Mecca.

Historically, the area was inhabited by the Quraysh, the Banu Kinanah and the Thaqif, among other tribes. Part of the Hejaz region, the province has seen several exchanges of power between many Islamic realms within a short period of time. The province gains its significance as it contains the city of Mecca, the birthplace of Muhammad, and several other historic Islamic sites, such as the village of Hudaybiyyah, where the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah is said to have been agreed upon. More recently, the province was modernized under the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the oil boom.
Most of the population is concentrated in three cities: Jeddah, Mecca and Ta&#x27;if. Jeddah is the largest city in the province and the second-largest in Saudi Arabia with an estimated population of 2,867,446 as of 2020. Mecca is the second-largest city in the province and third-largest in the kingdom at 1,323,624. After the city of Ta&#x27;if at third place, Rabigh, Shafa, Turbah and Jumum are other populous cities and towns in the region. The region receives Muslim pilgrims of the Umrah and the Hajj around the year and its population increases by up to 2 million during the Hajj. It has approximately of coastline on the Red Sea and hosts oil refineries in Rabigh, port and oil export facilities in Jeddah, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and the King Abdullah Economic City. The province also hosts part of the Haramain High Speed Railway line, which is Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first and only high-speed railway line.

The province is divided into 11 governorates, of which 5 have been classified Category A and the rest, Category B, with Mecca serving as the administrative headquarters and capital of the province. It is governed by an Emir, translated as Governor from Arabic, who is assisted by the Deputy Governor, both appointed by the King of Saudi Arabia. The current emir is Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud, who has held the position for a second term since 2015.

== History ==
Ancient Mecca was an oasis on the old caravan trade route that linked the Mediterranean world with South Arabia, East Africa, and South Asia. The town was located about midway between Maʾrib in the south and Petra in the north, and it gradually developed by Roman and Byzantine times into an important trade and religious centre. Ptolemy&#x27;s inclusion of Macoraba (Μακοράβα), a city of the Arabian interior, in his &quot;Guide to Geography&quot; was long held to show that Mecca was known to the Hellenistic world. Since the late 20th century, however, some scholarship has called the identification of Macoraba with Mecca into question.

According to Islamic tradition, Abraham and Ishmael, his son by Hagar, built the Kaʿbah as the house of God. The central point of pilgrimage in Mecca before the advent of Islam in the 7th century, the cube-shaped stone building has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. During pre-Islamic times the region was ruled by a series of Saudi tribes. Under the Quraysh it became a type of city-state, with strong commercial links to the rest of Arabia, Ethiopia, and Europe. Mecca became a place for trade, for pilgrimage, and for tribal gatherings. The city of Jeddah is believed to have been a fishing hamlet occupied by early Yemeni tribes. The region has held significant religious importance greatly increased with the expeditions of Muhammad in the early 7th century. As the ancient caravan route fell into decline, Mecca lost its commercial significance and has since lived mainly on the proceeds from the annual pilgrimages and the gifts of Muslim rulers.

The city of Mecca was sacked by the Umayyad general al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf, and thereafter the city, and at the time, the region, acknowledged the power of the Umayyad caliphate at Damascus and, following the eclipse of that dynasty, of the ʿAbbāsid caliphate of Baghdad. The city suffered great indignity at the hands of the Shīʿite Qarmatians in 930 when that sect&#x27;s leader Ṭāhir Sulaymān pillaged Mecca and carried off the Black Stone from the Kaʿbah. Beginning in the mid-10th century, the rulers of the city were chosen from the sharifs, or descendants of Muhammad, who retained a stronghold on the surrounding region while often paying homage to stronger political entities. The ability of the sharifs, originally moderate Shīʿites, to adapt to the changing political and religious climate ensured their preeminence in local affairs for the next 1,000 years. In 1269, the region came under the control of the Egyptian Mamlūk sultans. In 1517, dominion over the area passed to the Ottoman Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (now Istanbul). With the Ottoman collapse after World War I, control of Mecca was contested between the sharifs and the House of Saʿūd of central Arabia, adherents to an austere, puritanical form of Islam known as Wahhābism. King Ibn Saʿūd conquered the region in 1925, and the region of Mecca became a province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the city became the capital of the province.

The region underwent extensive economic development as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s petroleum resources were exploited after World War II, and the number of yearly pilgrims to Mecca has increased significantly.

== Geography ==
Most of the central and eastern portions of the province are desert, with the Hejaz mountains, which vary in elevation from 600 meters to 2000 meters, separating the relatively flat Nafud desert and coastal plains. Agriculture takes place in the region&#x27;s many wadis and oases, with the most commonly-grown crops being dates and barley, alongside other vegetables and fruits. The city of Ta&#x27;if is famous for its cultivation of the Rosa × damascena flower, simplified as Damask rose and locally known as Ta&#x27;if rose.

The province has an extended coastline that is approximately 700 kilometers (430 mi) long, with many cities spread out across the coastline. Several archipelagos can be found across the coast of the province, along with some coral reefs, such as the Great Coral Reef, located approximately 15 km (9 mi) northwest of Jeddah and the Five Coral Reef, located 25 km (16 mi). The coastline faces Sudan to the west and Eritrea and Ethiopia to the south. The province is bordered by the Madinah Province to the north, the Riyadh Province to the east, and the Al Baha and ʽAsir provinces to the south.

The Mecca Region hosts two of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s 15 designated protected areas managed by the Saudi Wildlife Authority: the Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area and the Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve, located on the eastern extremes of the province. Other minor sanctuaries in the province include the Saiysad Natural Reserve in the city of Ta&#x27;if and the Eastern Forest near Jeddah. The Hejaz mountains run through the center of the province, separating the Nafud desert from the western coastal plains, which run parallel to the coast of the province on the Red Sea.

<text>Najran ( &quot;&quot;) is a province of Saudi Arabia, located in the south of the country. It has an area of 149,511 km². Its capital is Najran.

Najran is inhabited by the Yam tribe. A significant percentage of the province&#x27;s inhabitants are Shia Ismaili. The current governor of the region is Prince Jiluwi bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.

==Etymology==
Similar to other ancient place names in Arabia, Najrān may have originally been the name of the whole oasis including all towns and villages. The old name of the ruins now known as &quot;al-Ukhdūd&quot;, which may have been the central town, probably corresponds to Ramat.

==Geography==

Najran contains three geographical areas. First, the flat area which lies in the middle of Najran. It has several valleys, the most famous of them being Najran’s valley. Second, the mountainous area which is in the west and the north. There the weather is moderate in summer. It has several parks shaded by nabk trees. It has important governorate centers: Habuna governorate, Badr El-Junoob governorate and Yadmah governorate. Many of the mountains are distinguished by granite rocks, where marble and granite are quarried. Third, the sandy area which lies in the east and is a part of the Empty Quarter. It is extremely rich in oil and water.

==Religious groups in Najran==
Najran, a fertile valley in what is now southwestern Saudi Arabia at the foot of mountains bordering the vast stretch of desert known as the Empty Quarter, was traditionally home to Christian and Jewish communities, in addition to Sulaymani Ismailis and Zaidis. Christians have been absent from Najran for some centuries, and the remaining Jewish community is Yemenite Jews that migrated to Najran and have left in 1949, following the establishment of the state of Israel. Najran&#x27;s Zaidi community in 2008 numbers around 2,000.

The 2004 Saudi census put the number of inhabitants in Najran at around 408,000. Sulaymani Ismailis, widely believed to constitute a large majority of the Najrani population, share an identity based on historical, cultural, and religious roots. In Najran city, the Khushaiwa compound, with its Mansura mosque complex, is the spiritual capital of the Sulaymani branch of the Ismaili sect, one of two major strands of contemporary Ismailism. Most Ismailis in Najran belong to one of two tribes: Yam and the Hamdan. There are also some Sunnis of the Yam tribe, both recent converts as well as those who have adhered to Sunni Islam for centuries.

===Ancient Christian community===

Najran is known for being home to an ancient settlement of Christians in the Arabian peninsula. They signed the &quot;Najran Pact&quot; in the 7th century with the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, promising them fair treatment as &quot;protected subjects&quot; (dhimmi) of the newly conquered territories. The village is now abandoned.

==Culture==

* Al-Burr: a breakfast meal which consists of bread made from wheat and flour, it is mixed and given the round ball shape and a hole is made to put milk, honey or dates in it

On the other hand, Najran has different kinds of traditional dance. For example, Al-Zamil which is an enthusiastic kind of poetry refers to special occasion in which so many men share together in the middle of a circle formed by old men. The stanzas of Al-Zamil are chosen carefully to express the subject for the occasion. Furthermore, Al-Zamil is considered to express emotions, and some time for apologies. Al-Razffah describes a dance which is used for wedding, or for happy occasions. Choirs come into rows and they sing poetry. Al-Razffah has a special time and special voice. Between the two rows two men meet each other and they dance in specific movements holding stilettos or sticks in their hands. Also there is another art that is (Laa&#x27;bat Ateran) done by black men.

<text>Tabuk ( &quot;&quot;) is a province of Saudi Arabia, located along the northwestern coast of the country, facing Egypt across the Red Sea. It has an area of 146,072 km2 and a population of 910,030 (2017). Its capital is Tabuk. The governor is Fahd bin Sultan since 1987. In recent years, the province has received substantial media attention due to the Saudi government&#x27;s planned Neom City project in the province.

== History ==

The history of the Tabuk region dates back to 5,000 years ago. The region is identified with the land of Madyan. The region is traversed by the Hejaz Railway, which was a focus for attacks during the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918.
The province has traditionally been inhabited by the Howeitat tribe.

== Population ==
== Major cities ==
* Tabuk
* Tayma
* Duba
* Al Wajh
* Haql
* Umluj
* Al-Bad&#x27;
* Neom (under construction)
* Amaala (under construction)

== Economy ==
Tabuk is an active commercial center, serving pilgrims passing through towards Mecca. Due to its moderate climate, it&#x27;s also the site of several dairy and poultry farms. The region (Astra) exports flowers to Europe, mainly lilies, statices and gladiolas. In the past, a narrow-gauge railway (1,050 mm / 3 ft 511⁄32 in track gauge) ran from Damascus to Medina through Tabuk. Remains of the railway can be found in Tabuk, where a large station was built. The station has since been restored.
== List of governors==
The governors of the region since 1926 are as follows:

* Muhammad ibn Abdulziz Alshahl from 1926 to 1930

<text>The provinces of Saudi Arabia, also known as regions (), are the 13 first-level administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

== History ==
After the unification of Saudi Arabia, the kingdom was divided into four provinces: the &#x27;Asir Province, Al Hasa&#x27; Province, the Hejaz Province and the Najd Province. 

King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud issued Royal Order A/92 on March 2, 1992, known as Law of the Provinces, which provided for the division of the kingdom into 13 provinces. Subsequently, the five previous provinces were divided into thirteen regions, called provinces (&quot;manātiq&quot;), each governed by administrative bodies called the emirates of the provinces (&quot;imārāt al-manātiq&quot;). The provinces form the first-level administrative division of the Organization of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and are further divided into 136 governorates (&quot;muḥāfaẓāt&quot;), which are the second-level division, which are further subdivided into 1,347 municipal-level units (&quot;marakiz&quot;), and further subdivided into villages (&quot;qura&quot;) and neighborhoods (&quot;ahya&quot;).

== Government ==
Each province is governed by an &quot;Emir&quot; (provincial governor), who is assisted by the deputy &quot;emir,&quot; called &quot;nā&#x27;ib.&quot; The persons holding these positions are appointed by the King of Saudi Arabia. The &quot;emir&quot; is given the rank of minister, while the deputy &quot;emir&quot; is given the rank of excellence.

<text>Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship, Inc. (or ADF) is a non-profit religious organization based in the United States, dedicated to the study and further development of modern Druidry.

In Modern Irish, () means &quot;our own magic&quot; (Druidism). &quot;A Druid Fellowship&quot; is therefore a backronym of &quot;ADF&quot;. The organization was founded in 1983 and incorporated in 1990 as a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by Isaac Bonewits. The organization&#x27;s first public announcement and membership sign-up took place at the first WinterStar Symposium in 1984 at Burr Oak State Park in Glouster, Ohio. ADF was originally organized as an Association, with Articles of Association signed by all Trustees on April 18, 1987.

ADF is a neodruidic organization practicing a unique tradition of Neopagan Druidry and is mostly U.S.-based, with members and groups in most states and in several other countries as well. During the years 2000 through 2010 to the present, ADF&#x27;s membership has remained well over 1000 persons, making it the largest public form of definitively &quot;Neopagan&quot; Druidism in the US.

Despite the Gaelic name, ADF Druidry actually encompasses all Indo-European religions, including Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Roman, Slavic, Gaulish, and Vedic religious practices. In that sense, ADF uses the term Druid as &quot;a member of the Indo-European intelligentsia, especially of the clergy&quot; or even more broadly as &quot;a worshipper of Indo-European gods and goddesses&quot;. Strictly speaking, members of ADF are not only &quot;druids&quot;, but are also members of related Indo-European religions which may have other terms for people in such clergy roles (e.g., gothi for clergy of ancient Norse religions).

==History==
Isaac Bonewits founded ADF with the goal of &quot;researching and expanding sound modern scholarship about the ancient Celts and other Indo-European peoples, in order to reconstruct what the Old Religions of Europe really were.&quot; Bonewits wanted to focus on scholarship as a reaction to more revisionist types of Neopaganism, such as those claiming direct descent from a &quot;Great Matriarchy&quot; of pre-historic times (see James Frazer&#x27;s The Golden Bough). The works of Georges Dumézil on Indo-European social structures and mythologies were especially influential in Bonewits&#x27;s thinking.

Related to the focus on scholarship, Isaac started the ADF Study Program with the goal of producing credible, knowledgeable Neopagan clergy; actual druid priests and priestesses, who would be able to fulfill all the roles of modern clergy for other Neopagans, such as birth, marriage, and funerary rites. Similarly, ADF&#x27;s official motto of &quot;Why not excellence?&quot; is an expression of the desire to create a &quot;bona fide&quot; religious tradition, rather than a small group that few would take seriously and which would not be around in a few years. ADF&#x27;s unofficial motto, &quot;As fast as a speeding oak,&quot; is meant to remind members that excellence takes time.

ADF was a reaction to many of the cultish pseudo-religions (Neopagan or not) with which Bonewits was familiar and (in a few cases) had experienced. Therefore, one of the first &quot;dogmas&quot; he promulgated was the &quot;Doctrine of Archdruidic Fallibility&quot;, which states that everyone, even the Archdruid, can make mistakes. However, ADF was also a reaction to the Reformed Druids of North America, a freethinking religious group which Bonewits considered too loose and not Neopagan enough.

==Beliefs==
ADF promotes a neo-druidism in which worshipers perform rituals honoring three kinds of entities: gods and goddesses, ancestors (honored dead), and nature spirits. Examples of gods and goddesses worshipped include Lugh, Cernunnos, the Morrigan, Thor, Freya, Apollo, Athena, Vesta, Ceres, and many other ancient, pre-Christian, Indo-European deities. Although various pantheons or &quot;hearth cultures&quot; are allowed, &quot;mixing and matching&quot; unrelated deities within a single rite is discouraged. Ancestors usually refers to the direct blood ancestors of the worshiper, but can include other honored dead (friends, mythological heroes, etc.), too. Nature spirits includes general animal (totem) spirits as well as whatever spirits are present in the place of worship, such as a local river spirit. Most ADF rituals occur outdoors.

In ADF terms, the triad of deities, ancestors, and nature spirits is called the &quot;Three Kindreds&quot;. There are other triads in ADF practice, such as the &quot;three realms&quot; of the Underworld (associated with the ancestors), the Heavens (associated with the gods), and this world (associated with the nature spirits); these are similar to the three worlds of the Celts, and to the Norse realms of Niflheim, Asgard, and Midgard. There are also three parts to this world; the Land, the Sea (including saltwater and freshwater bodies), and the Sky.

All of these triads are based on the common and pervasive theme of &quot;threes&quot; attributed to ancient Indo-European (and particularly Celtic) cultures. Similarly, ADF uses the common Indo-European themes of a sacred tree (e.g. the Norse Yggdrasil), a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; or opener of ways (e.g. the Norse god Heimdall, the Celtic god Manannan mac Lir, or the Hellenic god Hermes), and a treaty with hostile entities (e.g. the Norse Jotuns or the Celtic Fomorians). In these ways, ADF practice is an attempt to reconstruct earlier Indo-European beliefs and practices by using the records we have of ancient Indo-European cultures, and looking for commonalities among them which can then be applied to current spiritual practice.

ADF practice straddles the difficult middle ground between pure reconstructionism (attempting to recreate ancient practices as exactly as possible) and a less exclusive form of Neopaganism (an umbrella term for the loose agglomeration of pagan-based religions which arose in the early to middle 20th century, the most popular of which is Wicca). Thus, it attempts to be as authentic as possible given the realities of modern life. For example, ADF forbids any form of blood sacrifice in its official rituals, because even if it were appropriate in relation to one&#x27;s ancestors (who may have lived in agrarian societies that regularly killed their own food), it is not considered appropriate in modern society.

==Organization==
Local ADF congregations are known as &quot;groves&quot; (like groves of trees), and while group rituals are often regarded as more powerful than rituals performed individually, In 2017 there were about 70 groves worldwide. ADF also has many solitary members; some by choice, and some because there are no groves within easy traveling distance. There are also ADF &quot;protogroves&quot;, which are usually one or two people who would like to start a bigger grove. By forming a protogrove, they are able to appear on the list of ADF groves in the organization&#x27;s online and printed literature, and so attract potential new members.

One of ADF&#x27;s cornerstone principles is the notion that it is a &quot;public&quot; form of Neopaganism. Again, this was partly a reaction to the secretive religious groups Isaac was familiar with, such as closed covens which were limited in size to 13 members, or Masonic-style societies. In addition to promoting cult-ish behavior, such secretism in a larger sense was seen as unnecessarily promulgating the &quot;underground&quot; (occult, hidden) nature of Neopaganism. By making ADF a public tradition, its founder hoped to both prevent ADF from ever becoming a cult, and to further Neopaganism&#x27;s acceptance in broader society as a credible and sane family of religions.

As a result of these principles and intents, ADF groves are required to have open-to-the-public rituals on or near the eight &quot;High Days&quot; of the common Neopagan calendar such as Bealtaine, Lughnasadh, and Samhain (the holidays of the Wheel of the Year). Such rituals follow an established &quot;core order of ritual&quot; and are expected to focus on one particular pantheon or &quot;hearth culture&quot; for that high day. ADF groves are also required to perform some kind of public service on a quarterly basis (cleaning up parks and other ecological activities are popular).

An annual meeting of ADF is held at an event selected by the membership. Thus far it has been at either the Starwood Festival or the Wellspring Gathering, presently held at Tredara in Madison, Ohio, on Memorial Day Weekend and at Brushwood Folklore Center in the past. This meeting originated as part of the Starwood Festival in 1987 at Bear Creek KOA in East Sparta, Ohio, and was held at Starwood through 1992. Wellspring, run by Stone Creed Grove, became a separate event in 1991, and the National Members Meeting was moved to Wellspring in 1993. ADF still maintains a presence at the Starwood Festival, holding meetings and offering classes and rituals, and sometimes has more members attending there than at the Wellspring Gathering.

Anyone may join ADF, as membership is open to the public.

<text>The Ysaÿe Quartet (Quatuor Ysaÿe) was a French string quartet that was founded in 1984 by students at the Conservatoire de Paris named after the original Ysaÿe Quartet. It ended its existence in January 2014.

Its members as of the time they disbanded were:

* Guillaume Sutre (violin) (previously Christophe Giovaninetti)
* Luc-Marie Aguera (violin) (previously Romano Tommasini)
* Miguel da Silva (viola)
* Yovan Markovitch (cello) (previously Carlos Dourthe, then Michel Poulet, then Marc Coppey, then François Salque)

The ensemble undertook studies with members of the Amadeus Quartet in Cologne from 1986 to 1989. It won prizes at competitions in Trapani (2nd), Portsmouth (2nd) and Evian (1st). The quartet won admiration for its recordings of the quartets of Debussy and Ravel, and, with pianist Pascal Rogé, of the quintets of Fauré. They also performed a set of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Haydn&quot; Quartets for the Decca label to much acclaim. They taught at CNR in Paris and gave masterclasses in the mountain city of Flaine in France.

<doc id="468745" wikidata="Q6754535" url="?curid=468745" title="Marabastad, Pretoria">
<text>Marabastad (also called Asiatic Bazaar or Location) is a business area to the west of the city centre of Pretoria, South Africa. The original &quot;Maraba Village&quot;, situated just to the south of the present Marabastad, was founded and ruled by the Ndebele Chief Maraba. The name &quot;Marabastad&quot; is the Afrikaans word meaning &quot;Maraba&#x27;s Town&quot;.

== Background ==

Marabastad was a culturally diverse community, with the Hindu Mariamman Temple arguably being its most prominent landmark. Like the residents of other racially diverse areas in South Africa, such as District Six, &quot;Fietas&quot; and Sophiatown, the inhabitants of Marabastad were relocated to single-race townships further away from the city centre. These removals were due to Apartheid laws like the Group Areas Act. Unlike Sophiatown, Fietas and District Six, it was not bulldozed, but it retained many of its original buildings, and became primarily a business district, with most shops still owned by the Indians who had also lived there previously. Some property was however owned by the city council and the government, resulting in limited development taking place there. In addition, a large shopping complex was built to house Indian-owned shops.

The black residents of Marabastad were relocated to Atteridgeville (1945), the Coloured residents to Eersterus (1963), and the Indian residents to Laudium (1968). There are plans to revive once-picturesque Marabastad, and to reverse years of urban decay and neglect, although few seem to have been implemented as of 2005.

== History ==

Marabastad was named after the local headman of a village to the west of Steenhoven Spruit. During the 1880s he lived in Schoolplaats and acted as an interpreter. During this period some Africans lived on the farms where they were being employed and also chose to live on other, undeveloped land. Schoolplaats could also not accommodate all the migrants and this resulted in squatting.

An overflow from Schoolplaats to the north-west and Maraba&#x27;s village occurred and in August 1888 the land was surveyed by the government. The location Marabastad was established and was situated between the Apies River in the north, Skinner Spruit in the west, Steenhoven Spruit in the east and De Korte Street in the south. There were 67 stands varying between 1400 and 2500 square meters each. Residents were not allowed to own stands, but had to rent them from the government at 4 pounds a year. They were allowed to build their own houses and to plant crops on empty plots. Water was acquired from the various bordering rivers and 58 wells situated in the area.

The township was not private owned and was managed by the Transvaal Boer Republic. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 there were no rules and regulations with regard to Marabastad. Africans who streamed to Pretoria during the war were living in squatter camps near the artillery barracks, the brickworks and the railway stations at Prinshof. This resulted in the development of ‘New Marabastad’ in the area between Marabastad and the Asiatic Bazaar in 1900 by the British military authorities. They had been occupying the city since June 1900 and resettled refugees in the area. By 1901 there were 392 occupied stands in the New Marabastad and there was no real segregation between Africans, Indians and Coloured people.

Although New Marabastad was intended as a temporary settlement the military authorities granted permission for in their employ to erect brick houses. This resulted in the erection of other permanent structures like schools and churches. The new Town Council was established in 1902 and it was accepted that the residents of New Marabastad would be moved to other, planned townships. In 1903 New Marabastad had grown to 412 stands while Old Marabastad still only had 67. Along with the Cape Location, which was situated in the southern part of the Asiatic Bazaar, it fell under the jurisdiction of the City Council of that year. The greatest problem was the provision of water and this was only addressed after the war. Due to the fear of epidemic all wells in the area had been filled during the war, and a single public tap had replaced the entire system. New Marabastad didn&#x27;t have any wells or taps. There was an attempt to rectify this in 1903 by providing more taps, but the number was still inadequate.

In 1906 New and Old Marabastad became one location. Rates were determined and sanitary and building regulations came into effect. These regulations didn&#x27;t achieve their objections as a result of municipal maladministration and the fact that Africans could not own land and afford well-built permanent houses. Streets remained unpaved, the water supply was inadequate and there were no sanitary facilities worth mentioning. More and more shacks appeared. By 1907 conditions improved marginally, but the streets were left in their unkempt state and by 1910 this had still not been addressed. The Native Affairs Department accused the Pretoria Town Council of inefficient administration, which had led directly to this situation.

== Removals ==

The relocation of residents of Old Marabastad had been on the agenda of the town council since 1903 and in 1907, when the council decided to build a new sewage farm, it became a reality. It was decided to remove all residents of the area to a new location further away from the city centre and to demolish the old township. Now followed the struggle of finding a suitable site. The site on the southern slope of Daspoortrand was decided on in 1912 and in January planning for the ‘New Location’ started. It would include a number of brick houses that could be rented from the municipality. By September of the same year the first relocations were taking place and demolishing of old structures commenced. It was a slow process and Old Marabastad was only completely destroyed by 1920.

The lack of space remained a problem and New Marabastad was experiencing severe overcrowding. By 1923 the last houses of the second municipal project was completed in New Location and Marabastad residents who had been exposed to the worst conditions were allowed to move in first. In 1934 part of the Schoolplaats population was moved to Marabastad and the squatter problem became more severe. There was no room for expansion due to a lack of space.

An attempt to solve these problems manifested itself in the establishment of Atteridgeville in 1939. The Marabastad community would be moved here and compensation was offered to previous owners of property in the form of new houses they could rent, but not own. The war slowed the process considerably, but 1949 had moved three quarters of the population of Marabastad to Atteridgeville, and by 1950 the transition was complete.

<text>Siddharth Pico Raghavan Iyer (born 11 February 1957), known as Pico Iyer, is an English-born essayist and novelist known chiefly for his travel writing. He is the author of numerous books on crossing cultures including &quot;Video Night in Kathmandu&quot;, &quot;The Lady and the Monk&quot; and &quot;The Global Soul&quot;. He has been a contributor to &quot;Time,&quot; &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Early life==
Iyer was born Siddharth Pico Raghavan Iyer in Oxford, England, the son of Indian parents. His father was Raghavan N. Iyer, a philosopher and political theorist then enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Oxford. His mother was the religious scholar and teacher Nandini Nanak Mehta. He is the great-great-grandson of Indian Gujarati writer Mahipatram Nilkanth. Both of his parents grew up in India then went to England for tertiary education. His name is a combination of the Buddha&#x27;s name, Siddhartha, and that of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Pico della Mirandola.

When Iyer was seven, in 1964, his family moved to California, when his father started working with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a California-based think tank, and started teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara. For over a decade, Iyer moved between schools and college in England and his parents&#x27; home in California.

He was a King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton College, and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford and was awarded a congratulatory double first in English literature in 1978. He then received an A.M. in literature from Harvard University in 1980. He received the [Oxford MA] in 1982.

==Career==
Iyer taught writing and literature at Harvard before joining &quot;Time&quot; in 1982 as a writer on world affairs. Since then, he has travelled widely, from North Korea to Easter Island, and from Paraguay to Ethiopia, while writing works of non-fiction and two novels, including &quot;Video Night in Kathmandu&quot; (1988), &quot;The Lady and the Monk&quot; (1991), &quot;The Global Soul&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Man Within My Head&quot; (2012). He is also a frequent speaker at literary festivals and universities around the world. He delivered popular TED talks in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019 [see ted.com] and has twice been a Fellow at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

In 2019, he served as Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University, Guest Director of the Telluride Film Festival. He was also the first writer-in-residence at Raffles Hotel Singapore, where he released his book, &quot;This Could be Home (2019)&quot;, which explores Singapore&#x27;s heritage through its landmarks.

== Writing themes ==
Iyer&#x27;s writings build on his growing up in a combination of English, American, and Indian cultures. Travel is a key theme in most of his works. In one of his works, The Global Soul (2000) he takes on the international airport as a central subject, along with associated jet lag, displacement and cultural mingling. As a travel writer, he often writes of living between the cracks and outside fixed categories. Many of his books have been about trying to see from within some society or way of life, but from an outsider&#x27;s perspective. He has filed stories from Bhutan, Nepal, Ethiopia, Cuba, Argentina, Japan, and North Korea. Some of the topics that he explores in his works include revolution in Cuba, Sufism, Buddhist Kyoto, and global disorientation. In his own words from a 1993 article in Harper&#x27;s, &quot;I am a multinational soul on a multinational globe on which more and more countries are as polyglot and restless as airports. Taking planes seems as natural to me as picking up the phone or going to school; I fold up my self and carry it around as if it were an overnight bag.&quot; His writing alternating between the monastery and the airport, Iyer is described by Indian writer Pradeep Sebastian as &quot;Thomas Merton on a frequent flier pass aiming to bring new global energies and possibilities into nonfiction&quot;.

He has written numerous pieces on world affairs for &quot;Time&quot;, including cover stories, and the &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; story on Corazon Aquino in 1986. He has written on literature for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;; on globalism for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;; on travel for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;; and on many other themes for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, contributing up to a hundred articles a year to various publications. He has contributed liner-notes for four Leonard Cohen albums. His books have appeared in 23 languages so far, including Turkish, Russian, and Indonesian. He has also written introductions to more than 70 books, including works by R. K. Narayan, Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, Michael Ondaatje, Peter Matthiessen, and Isamu Noguchi.

He has appeared seven times in the annual &quot;Best Spiritual Writing&quot; anthology, and three times in the annual &quot;Best American Travel Writing&quot; anthology, and has served as guest editor for both. He has also appeared in the &quot;Best American Essays&quot; anthology.

The &quot;Utne Reader&quot; named him in 1995 as one of 100 Visionaries worldwide who could change your life, while the &quot;New Yorker&quot; observed that &quot;As a guide to far-flung places, Pico Iyer can hardly be surpassed.&quot;

==Personal life==
Iyer has been based since 1992 in Nara, Japan, where he lives with his Japanese wife, Hiroko Takeuchi, and her two children from an earlier marriage. His book, &quot;The Lady and the Monk (1991)&quot;, was a memoir and a reflection of his relationship with Takeuchi. His family home in Santa Barbara, California burned down due to a wildfire in 1990. Reflecting on this event, in his words, &quot;For more and more of us, home has really less to do with a piece of soil, than you could say, with a piece of soul.&quot; He splits his time between Japan and California. Asked if he feels rooted and accepted as a foreigner (regarding his current life in Japan) Iyer notes:

Iyer has known the 14th Dalai Lama since he was in his late teens, when he accompanied his father to Dharamshala, India, in 1974. In discussions about his spirituality, Iyer has mentioned not having a formal meditation practice, but practicing regular solitude, visiting a remote hermitage near Big Sur several times a year.

Moréri was born in 1643 in Bargemon, a village in the ancient province of Provence. His great-grandfather, Joseph Chatranet, a native of Dijon, had settled in Provence under King Charles IX of France and taken the name of the village of Moréri, which he acquired through marriage.

Louis Moréri studied humanities in Draguignan and later rhetoric and philosophy at the Jesuit College of Aix-en-Provence. He then studied theology, obtaining his doctoral degree, and was ordained a priest in Lyon. During his stay in Lyon, he published several works, among them &quot;La pratique de la perfection chrétienne et religieuse&quot; (1667), a translation of the work of the Spanish Jesuit theologian, Alonso Rodriguez. It was probably in Lyon that he met Samuel Chappuzeau, who claimed to have first given him the idea of writing his encyclopedia.

In 1675, shortly after publishing the first edition of his encyclopedia, Moréri accompanied his bishop to Paris, where he became acquainted with Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne, then the minister of foreign affairs. Three years later, he was hired to be a tutor for Pomponne&#x27;s children. During this time, he worked on a second edition of his encyclopedia. In 1680, midway through the printing of the second edition, he died of tuberculosis.

==Legacy==

Moréri&#x27;s encyclopedia, &quot;Le Grand Dictionaire historique, ou le mélange curieux de l&#x27;histoire sacrée et profane&quot; (literally, &quot;The Great Historical Dictionary, or Curious Anthology of Sacred and Secular History&quot;, although it was translated differently into English at the time) was first published in Lyon in 1674. The encyclopedia focused almost exclusively on historical and biographical articles. Moréri dedicated it to Gaillard de Longjumeau, the Bishop of Apt, to whom he had been appointed chaplain. Moréri&#x27;s one-volume edition of 1674 and posthumous two-volume edition of 1681 were revised and expanded by others after his death. At least twenty-four editions were published between 1674 (one volume) and 1759 (ten volumes). The encyclopedia was also translated and adapted into English, German, Dutch and Spanish.

Moréri&#x27;s &quot;Grand Dictionaire historique&quot; gave rise to a more famous encyclopedia, Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;The Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot; (1697). Bayle conceived his work as correcting and making up for deficiencies of Moréri&#x27;s work.

<text>New Valley Governorate is an enormous governorate in Egypt. It is also called El Wadi El Gedid Governorate ( , ). It is in the southwestern part of the country, in the south of Egypt Western Desert (part of the Sahara Desert), between the Nile, northern Sudan, and southeastern Libya. 

Consisting of roughly half of Egypt&#x27;s area, this governorate is the country&#x27;s largest and most sparsely populated, and one of the largest country subdivisions in the world. The capital is Kharga. New Valley Governorate is named after the New Valley Project, which aims to irrigate parts of the Western Desert.

==Municipal divisions== 
The governorate is divided into municipal divisions with a total estimated population, as of January 2024, at 270,854. In the case of New Valley governorate, there is one kism with urban and rural parts, and four marakiz. 

In an effort to decentralize the administration of Kharga, it was divided into four sections effective 19 June, 2018.

==Population==
According to population estimates, in 2015 the majority of residents in the governorate lived in rural areas, with an urbanization rate of only 48.0%. Out of an estimated 225,416 people residing in the governorate, 117,180 people lived in rural areas and only 108,236 lived in urban areas. In 2018 the population was 245,000, with an urbanization rate of 46.7%.

==Cities, towns, oases==
New Valley has a number of cities, towns and oases. As of 2018, Kharga Oasis, and Dakhla Oasis were the two places in New Valley with a population of over 15,000. Farafra Oasis and Baris Oasis are also in New Valley. 

==Industrial zones==
According to the Egyptian Governing Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), in affiliation with the Ministry of Investment (MOI), the following industrial zones are located in this governorate:
*Al Kharga
*Heavy industrial zone - El Dakhla 
*Heavy industrial zone - Wadi Waer West
New Valley also contains some farming areas created by the New Valley project, like Sharq El Owainat.

==History==

=== 2011 Egyptian revolution ===

Violent clashes were reported in the New Valley Governorate on February 8–9, 2011 as part of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Protesters set fire to police stations and the National Democratic Party building. Multiple deaths were reported in addition to hundreds of injuries amid claims that the police opened fire on protesters in Kharga Oasis with live ammunition.

=== 2014 Farafra ambush ===

On 19 July 2014, unidentified gunmen ambushed a desert checkpoint by the Farafra Oasis Road in New Valley Governorate. Twenty-two border guards were killed in the attack, which was one of the biggest since the July 2013 ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi and the second at the same checkpoint in less than three months.

<doc id="468770" wikidata="Q5311333" url="?curid=468770" title="Duchies in Sweden">
<text>Duchies in Sweden have been allotted since the 13th century to powerful Swedes, almost always to princes of Sweden (only in some of the dynasties) and wives of the latter. From the beginning these duchies were often centers of regional power, where their dukes and duchesses had considerable executive authority of their own, under the central power of their kings or queens regnant. Since the reign of King Gustav III the titles have practically been nominal, with which their bearers only rarely have enjoyed any ducal authority, though often maintaining specially selected leisure residences in their provinces and some limited measure of cultural attachment to them.

==Today==

In Sweden today, Duke (&quot;hertig&quot;) is considered a dynastical title, and is only given to members of the Royal House (currently Bernadotte). Unlike British dukedoms, for example, these Swedish titles are not hereditary. Modern Swedish duchies have always been named for the historical provinces of Sweden, which are no longer governmental entities. Currently, there are twelve such duchies one of which includes two of the provinces:

* The Duchess and Duke of Västergötland (&quot;Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel&quot;)
* The Duchess of Östergötland (&quot;Princess Estelle&quot;)
* The Duke of Skåne (&quot;Prince Oscar&quot;)
* The Duke and Duchess of Värmland (&quot;Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia&quot;)
* The Duke of Södermanland (&quot;Prince Alexander&quot;)
* The Duke of Dalarna (&quot;Prince Gabriel&quot;)
* The Duke of Halland (&quot;Prince Julian&quot;)
* The Duchess of Västerbotten (&quot;Princess Ines&quot;)
* The Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland (&quot;Princess Madeleine&quot;)
* The Duchess of Gotland (&quot;Princess Leonore&quot;)
* The Duke of Ångermanland (&quot;Prince Nicolas&quot;)
* The Duchess of Blekinge (&quot;Princess Adrienne&quot;)

The titles today are given to, and kept by, legitimate members of the Swedish royal family for life, except for Swedish monarchs, who do not continue to hold ducal titles after ascending the throne. Only in connection with his ascension in 1973 has the current king occasionally been referred to as King of Sweden &quot;and&quot; Duke of Jämtland. He became the &quot;Duke of Jämtland&quot; after his christening, and held that title until his ascension to the Swedish throne in 1973. However, his wife, current Queen Silvia, whom he married in 1976, is not a duchess, and no other queen consorts have ever continued to have any such title either, after their husbands became King. Otherwise, &quot;royal&quot; spouses of ducal title holders are also created dukes and duchesses upon marriage (this would not include spouses who do not become Swedish royalty, such as those who married &quot;former dukes&quot; who had given up their titles for unapproved marriages). The first example of a man acquiring the Swedish ducal title of a woman was at the 2010 marriage of Crown Princess Victoria to Prince Daniel. Currently the prerequisite for a ducal title has been assumed by the public to be the position of Prince or Princess of Sweden, and for that being a Swedish citizen, however no definite policy has been published.

==History==

The first use in Swedish of the title of &quot;hertig&quot; was in 1266 by Prince Magnus, son of Princess Ingeborg and Birger Jarl. That title (derived from German &quot;herzog&quot;) then replaced the older Nordic &quot;jarl&quot;, both translated into the Latin title &quot;dux&quot;, However, professor of art history Jan Svanberg is of the opinion that since Birger Jarl (died 1266) was depicted with a ducal coronet of English and continental European design, he actually was a duke, and that his Latin title of &quot;Dux Sueorum&quot; should be given as &quot;Duke and Regent of Sweden&quot; in English. Svanberg&#x27;s opinion would then make duchesses of both of Birger&#x27;s wives Ingeborg (died 1254) and Matilda (died 1288), in English usage.

In the 13th and 14th century, kings of the Bjälbo dynasty gave his sons duchies to rule as fiefs. The geography of these duchies could be unclear, as they were not always within the boundaries of one province and could also be reallotted with territorial changes. Feuds between a king and ducal brothers were common, and ended at times in assassination and fratricide. There was only one non-royal Swedish duke, Bengt Algotsson, Duke of Halland and Finland in 1350s. The tradition was discontinued during the Kalmar union.

After the Kalmar Union period, just before his death in 1560, King Gustav I took up the tradition by making his sons John, Magnus and Carl powerful dukes, together ruling much more of the kingdom than their older half-brother Eric, who had held a duchy in the southeast. When Eric became King Eric XIV, the imbalance of power his father had created became destructive. John, with the aid of Carl, eventually revolted, dethroned Eric and became king; Magnus proved unimportant due to mental health issues, but Carl&#x27;s duchy of Södermanland prospered as a separate territory for several decades and also made his eventual rise to the throne possible. His duchy was inherited by his younger son, Carl Philip, who died in 1622 having been the last holder of one of the semi-autonomous Swedish duchies, which his brother, King Gustav II Adolph, officially abolished in 1618.

During the subsequent rule of Queen Christina of Sweden, however, her cousin and heir Carl Gustav of the Palatinate-Zweibrücken was titled Duke of Öland by the Swedish sovereign herself, but her government refused to acknowledge that title officially. His father was created Duke of Stegeborg in 1651, a title that a younger brother of Carl Gustav&#x27;s eventually inherited.

In 1772, King Gustav III reinstated the appointment of dukes, now non-hereditary, for his brothers as courtesy titles, which added to their international prestige and domestic influence. Since then, all Swedish princes have been created dukes of a province at birth, as well as one Great Prince or Grand Duke of Finland (who died in infancy). During the 20th century, because of constitutional restraints, several princes gave up their royal titles for marriages that were not approved by the King (see Bernadotte af Wisborg). Whether or not they then actually lost their ducal titles too has never been formally or legally determined.

For the first time since the 14th century a princess of Sweden was created duchess in her own right in 1980, coinciding with the amendment of the Act of Succession allowing female succession to the throne. Thus, King Carl XVI Gustaf&#x27;s eldest daughter Victoria became Crown Princess (displacing her younger brother Carl Philip) and received the title of &quot;Duchess of Västergötland&quot;. Her younger sister Madeleine was the first princess to be created duchess at birth, and also the first to get a double duchy (see above), roughly corresponding with the modern governmental limits of Gävleborg County. Such modern ducal titles are handled by the King of Sweden personally, are unregulated by law and not registered as names in the Swedish Tax Agency&#x27;s population census.

Now the title holders are mainly known domestically as &quot;Crown Princess Victoria&quot;, &quot;Prince Daniel&quot;, &quot;Princess Estelle&quot;, &quot;Prince Oscar&quot;, &quot;Prince Carl Philip&quot;, &quot;Princess Sofia&quot;, &quot;Prince Alexander&quot;, &quot;Prince Gabriel&quot;, &quot;Prince Julian&quot;, &quot;Princess Ines&quot;, &quot;Princess Madeleine&quot;, &quot;Princess Leonore&quot;, &quot;Prince Nicolas&quot; and &quot;Princess Adrienne&quot; though the ducal titles often are included in formal communication and royal court usage. In writing to them, it is considered correct to address all of them but the Crown Princess by ducal title. As of 1772, the dukes and duchesses do not normally reside permanently within their duchies, though they are associated with them to some extent by making occasional visits, seen as beneficial to public relations for the County Administrative Boards and local business.
==List of dukes and duchesses by duchy in Sweden==
Since Magnus III of Sweden was the first bearer of the Swedish title &quot;hertig&quot;, this list begins, in the chronological aspect, with him.

This list of dukes and duchesses in Sweden excludes minor duchies (individual towns, manors, mines, estates) as well as dominions such as Estonia and Bremen-Verden. For ease of reference, most provinces are listed by their modern Swedish names with Latin or English exonyms, by which many past dukes have been known, given as alternatives. Years given are those during which ducal titles incontestably were held, regardless of subsequent status as monarchs or former royalty. Since the accession of Charles XIII in 1809, the Royal Court of Sweden has neither recognized that ducal titles are continued to be borne by kings, nor that those were still valid that had been given to princes who subsequently lost their royal status (also see Sigvard Bernadotte). There is also no evidence that domestic provincial ducal titles continued to be borne by kings in earlier eras.

<text>Monufia Governorate ( &quot;&quot; ) is one of the governorates of Egypt. Monufia’s name was derived from the hieroglyphic word “Nafr”, which means “The Good Land”. It is located in the northern part of the country in the Nile Delta, to the south of Gharbia Governorate and to the north of Cairo. The governorate of Monufia is known for being the birthplace of four Egyptian presidents: Mohammad Anwar el-Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, Adly Mansour, and Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The governorate is named after Menouf, an ancient city which was the capital of the governorate until 1826. The current governor (as of 2018) is Said Mohammed Mohammed Abbas.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into municipal divisions, with a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 4,802,305. In some instances there is a markaz and a kism with the same name.

==Population==
According to population estimates in 2015, the majority of residents in the governorate lived in rural areas, with an urbanization rate of only 20.6%. Out of an estimated 3,941,293 people residing in the governorate, 3,128,460 people lived in rural areas as opposed to only 812,833 in urban areas.

==Cities==
The capital of the Monufia Governorate is the city of Shibin El Kom. The main cities of the governorate are Quesna, Tala, Bagour, Menouf, Ashmoun and Sers El Lyan. It is mainly an agricultural governorate.

*Shibin El Kom 
*Menouf
*Ashmoun 
*Sers El Lyan 
* Tala 
* El Bagour
*El Shohada 
*Sadat City
*Quesna 
*Birket El Sab
*Shanawan

==Industrial zones==
According to the Egyptian Governing Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), in affiliation with the Ministry of Investment (MOI), the following industrial zones are located in this governorate:
*Mubarak Industrial Zone and its expansion.
*Industrial Zones In kafr Dawod.
* (New urban community industrial zone) El Sadat.
*Industrial zone El lawy stud ran by El doc ramy.

==History==
In 1826, Mohammed Ali transferred the capital of Monufia from Menouf to Shibin El Kom as the latter fell exactly in the center of the governorate. Other than Shibin El Kom, the governorate had four other administrative divisions which are Quesna, Tala, Menouf and Talawy. In 1942, El Shohada became a new administrative division and included parts from Shibin El Kom and Tala. In 1947, Bagour was created to encompass regions from Menouf, Talawy, Quesna and Shibin El Kom. In 1955, five villages were taken from Tala and redistributed to Tanta. In 1960, Berket El Sabe&#x27;e (Lake of the Lion) was established and consisted of former towns and villages of Tala, Quesna and Shibin El Kom. In 1975, Sers El Lyan became a city rather than a village after it was separated from Menouf. In 1991, Sadat City was annexed to Monufia, being its only region west of the Rosetta branch. In the final round of the 2012 Egyptian presidential election, Monufia had the highest voter turnout rate of all governorates (61.5%) as well as the most overwhelming support for candidate Ahmed Shafik (71.5%).

==Agriculture==

The governorate is famous for the production of crops like cotton, maize and wheat as well as vegetable crops such as potatoes and green beans of which a large part is exported. Agricultural land is irrigated with water from the Rosetta and Damietta branches of the Nile. Agriculture is generally the main activity of the population due to the fertile land in the Nile Delta.

== Relationship to other Egyptians ==
Menoufis are the subject of numerous stereotypes among other Egyptians, with the most popular one being about how greedy they are. The reason for this particular stereotype is because of a story since the Mamluk Sultanate. During the Mamluk dynasty, a Mamluk killed someone, however the crime was witnessed by a Menoufi man, the Mamluk went to the Menoufi and fed him all kinds of meat and the best food ever, all the man had to do was bear false witness in front of the judge. On the day of judgement, the Menoufi told the truth to the judge and the Mamluk man was sentenced to jail, after that case, the phrase “المنوفي لا يوفي” (The Menoufi is not loyal) became popular. 

==Notable residents==
* St. Pishoy
* Anwar Sadat (1918–1981)
* Hosni Mubarak (1928–2020).
* Omar Fayed (b. 2003), Fenerbahçe football player
* Naguib El-Helaly Gohar (1944–2015), professor and university president

==Projects==
In 1981, the Basic Village Service Program (BVS), under the auspices of USAID, had several water, road, and other projects, going on in several markazes in the Monufia Governorate.

In 2018, the National Agricultural Animal Health Services (NAAHS) was formed by the Ministry of Agriculture in order to care for the rising number of infected horses and donkeys in the Shibin El-Kom area. This was sparked by the tragedy.

Menoufia University is one of the most important educational institutions in the governorate. It was established by a presidential decree in 1976.

<text>Asyūṭ Governorate () is one of the many governorates of Egypt. It stretches across a section of the Nile River. The capital of the governorate is the city of Asyut.

==Etymology==
The name of Asyut is derived from early Egyptian &quot;Zawty&quot; (&quot;Z3JW.TJ&quot;), late Egyptian &quot;Səyáwt&quot; into Coptic &quot;Syowt&quot;. An &quot;A&quot; was added to the beginning of the name &quot;Syowt&quot; to become Asyut.

<doc id="468799" wikidata="Q743492" url="?curid=468799" title="Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton">
<text>Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, (pronunciation uncertain: &quot;Rezley&quot;, &quot;Rizely&quot; (archaic), (present-day) and have been suggested; 6 October 1573 – 10 November 1624) was the only son of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, and Mary Browne, daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. Shakespeare&#x27;s two narrative poems, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, were dedicated to Southampton, who is frequently identified as the Fair Youth of Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets.

==Family==
Henry Wriothesley, born 6 October 1573 at Cowdray House, Sussex, was the only son of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, by Mary Browne. She was the only daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, and his first wife, Jane Radcliffe. He had two sisters, Jane, who died before 1573, and Mary (), who in June 1585 married Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour.

After his father&#x27;s death, Southampton&#x27;s mother married firstly, on 2 May 1594, as her second husband, Sir Thomas Heneage (d. 17 October 1595), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. After being widowed again, she married, between 5 November 1598 and 31 January 1599, Sir William Hervey. She died in November 1607.

==Early life==
When his father died on 4 October 1581, Southampton inherited the earldom and landed income valued at £1,097 6s per annum. His wardship and marriage were sold by the Queen to her kinsman, Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, for £1,000. According to Akrigg, Howard &quot;entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to Lord Burghley personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands.&quot; Late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age went to live at Cecil House in the Strand.

In October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589. His name was entered at the Gray&#x27;s Inn legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.

On Southampton&#x27;s 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton&#x27;s age in his diary. By 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton&#x27;s grandfather, Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, and Southampton&#x27;s mother, Mary, for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley&#x27;s eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth Vere, daughter of Burghley&#x27;s daughter, Anne Cecil, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. But Southampton did not like the match and, in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit Henry Garnet reported the rumour that &quot;The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth £5000 of present payment&quot;.

In 1591, Lord Burghley&#x27;s Clerk in Chancery, John Clapham, dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, &quot;Narcissus&quot;, recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford in late September 1592 and was praised in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s visit.

In October 1592 Southampton&#x27;s grandfather, Viscount Montague, died. Montague had been a Knight of the Garter, and on 3 May 1593, Philip Gawdy of Clifford&#x27;s Inn (a law school and Inn of Chancery) wrote to his brother, Bassingbourne Gawdy, that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the Lord Keeper, Lord Burgh, and Lord Willoughby de Eresby. Shortly thereafter, in his &quot;Honour of the Garter&quot; dated 26 June 1593, George Peele referred to him as &quot;Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton&#x27;s star&quot;, claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights. However, it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under King James.

==Southampton and Shakespeare==
In 1593 Shakespeare dedicated his narrative poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; to Southampton, followed in 1594 by &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Although the dedication to &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; is more restrained, the dedication to &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; is couched in extravagant terms:

The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours.

This type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual, however, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author&#x27;s work – mainly for political and, above all, financial reasons.

Nathan Drake, in &quot;Shakespeare and his Times&quot;, was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare&#x27;s two long narrative poems, but also the &quot;Fair Youth&quot; of the &quot;Sonnets&quot;. The title page refers to the &quot;onlie begetter of these sonnets Mr W.H.,&quot; and it had earlier been inferred that the &quot;Sonnets&quot; were addressed to &quot;Mr. W.H.&quot;. Drake, however, adopting Chalmers&#x27; suggestion that one meaning of &quot;beget&quot; is &quot;bring forth&quot;, argued that Mr. W.H. was the procurer of the manuscript rather than the &quot;Fair Youth&quot; addressed in the poems. Confirmation of this as also that &quot;Mr. W.H.&quot; was the William Hervey who married Southampton&#x27;s mother and inherited &#x27;her goods&#x27; is provided by Edward Chaney. Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the &quot;Sonnets&quot; have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity. But, Honan argues that although Southampton
may be involved in Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets ... there is no real likelihood that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly &quot;lascivious&quot; (sonnet 95), &quot;sensual&quot; to a &quot;fault&quot; or to his &quot;shame&quot; (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with vices.

Despite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare&#x27;s two long narrative poems. Nicholas Rowe, on the authority of poet and playwright William Davenant (1606 – 7 April 1668), stated in his &quot;Life of Shakespeare&quot; that Southampton once gave Shakespeare £1,000 to &quot;go through with a purchase&quot;, but Honan terms this a myth.

==The 1590s==
Southampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s. On 27 June 1593 Thomas Nashe completed his picaresque novel, &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;, and dedicated it to Southampton, terming him &quot;a dere lover and cherisher ... as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves&quot;, and in 1593 Barnabe Barnes published &quot;Parthenophil and Parthenope&quot; with a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton. In 1595 Gervase Markham included a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton in &quot;The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight&quot;. On 2 March 1596 John Florio&#x27;s Italian/English dictionary was entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register. In his dedication, Florio, who was for some years in the Earl&#x27;s &quot;pay and patronage&quot;, complimented Southampton on his fluency in Italian, saying he &quot;had become so complete a master of Italian as to have no need of travel abroad to perfect his mastery of that tongue&quot;. In 1597 Henry Lok included a sonnet to Southampton among the sixty dedicatory sonnets in his &quot;Sundry Christian Passions&quot;. In the same year William Burton dedicated to him a translation of Achilles Tatius&#x27;s, &quot;Clitophon and Leucippe&quot;.

On 4 October 1594 Southampton&#x27;s friend, Sir Henry Danvers, shot Henry Long, brother of Sir Walter Long, in the course of a local feud between the Danvers and Long families. Sir Henry and his elder brother, Sir Charles Danvers, fled to Titchfield, where Southampton sheltered them. The brothers were outlawed, and eventually escaped to the continent where they took refuge at the court of King Henri IV.

On 17 November 1595, Southampton jousted in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession day tournament, earning a mention in George Peele&#x27;s &quot;Anglorum Feriae&quot; as &quot;gentle and debonaire&quot;. However, according to Akrigg, &quot;Gentle and debonair he may have been, but we never again hear of Southampton being high in the graces of Queen Elizabeth&quot;.

On 13 April 1596 the Queen specifically instructed Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, not to take either Southampton or the Earl of Derby, with him on an expedition for the Relief of Calais, and it also appears that Southampton did not accompany Essex on the Cadiz Expedition that summer. In February 1597 Southampton challenged the Earl of Northumberland to a duel with rapiers, requiring intervention by the Queen and Privy Council, and on 1 March stood godfather at the christening of Sir Robert Sidney&#x27;s daughter, Bridget. Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his &quot;inglorious&quot; Voyage to the Azores, where according to Rowland Whyte, &quot;My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the Kings great Men of Warre, and suncke her&quot;. On his return, he made his first appearance in the House of Lords on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a &quot;chronic absentee&quot;. By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.

In 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with Ambrose Willoughby, one of the Queen&#x27;s esquires of the body, who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing the card game primero after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and &quot;Willoughby puld of some of his locke&quot;, for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying &quot;he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out&quot;. There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, Elizabeth Vernon, one of the Queen&#x27;s Maids of Honour. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless, it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that &quot;My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym&quot;. Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen&#x27;s disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying Sir Robert Cecil on an embassy to Henri IV of France. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in Angers, where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.

When Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with Sir Charles Danvers and Sir Henry Danvers, whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture, the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, Elizabeth Vernon. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the Fleet Prison for marrying without royal permission.

The Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November, he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the Dowager Countess, over her prospective marriage to Sir William Hervey. Lord Henry Howard was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.

In 1599, during the Nine Years&#x27; War (1595–1603), Southampton went to Ireland with Essex, who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at Arklow in County Wicklow. Shortly after the Essex&#x27;s Rebellion in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to Sir Robert Cecil. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:
I do mervell also what becam of pearse edmones, the earle of Essex man, borne in strand neare me, and which has had many rewards &amp; preferments by the earle essex, his villany I have often complained of, he dweles in London, he was corporall generall of the horse in Ierland under the earle of Sowthamton, he eate &amp; drank at his table and lay in his tente, the earle of Sowthamton gave him a horse, which edmones refused a 100 markes for him, the earle Sowthamton would cole and huge him in his armes and play wantonly with him. This pearse began to fawne and flatter me in Ierland offering me great curtesie, telling me what pay grases &amp; giftes they earles bestowed uppon him, therby seming to move and anymate me to desiar and looke for the like favour, But I coeld never love &amp; afecte them to make them my frends, esspecially essex whoes mynd I ever mistrusted...
According to Duncan-Jones, Reynolds&#x27; letter hints that &#x27;rewards could be obtained from either or both of the two Earls in return for sexual favours&#x27;. On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had &quot;complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones &amp; sodometicall sines over flowing this land&quot;.

On his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. &quot;My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland,&quot; wrote Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert Sydney in 1599, &quot;come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day&quot;.

Southampton was deeply involved in Essex&#x27;s Rebellion of 1601, and in February of that year, he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency, obtained the commutation of his penalty to life imprisonment.

==Life under King James==

On the accession of James I Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. His first task was to organise the large lavish celebrations including a feast and ball which were laid on at the Palace of Whitehall following the signing of the Treaty of London with Spain.

On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex, Southampton had induced the players at the Globe Theatre to revive &quot;Richard II.&quot; After his release from prison in 1603, he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605, he entertained Queen Anne at Southampton House with a performance of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; by Burbage and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged.

Southampton seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the Main Plot and Bye Plot. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to Buckingham. He was a volunteer on the Protestant side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the Barbary pirates.

Southampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices&quot;in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization&quot;.

He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at Titchfield. He developed his properties in London, in Bloomsbury and Holborn; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the East India Company and the New England Company, and backed Henry Hudson&#x27;s search for the Northwest Passage.

Henry Timberlake, a member of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, also was active in the East India Company and may have been involved in Southampton&#x27;s activities in Titchfield. He died there in 1625 and was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s parish church.

A significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of George Chapman, Samuel Daniel, Thomas Heywood, and the composer Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger. Heywood&#x27;s popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton&#x27;s maritime and colonial interests.

==Virginia Company==

Henry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the New World Tapestry, took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the Virginia Company&#x27;s governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at Jamestown were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir Edwin Sandys, who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton&#x27;s faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation&#x27;s overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished.

His name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of Hampton Roads, and the Hampton River. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of Hampton, Virginia, as well as Southampton County, Virginia and Northampton County. However, the name Southampton was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of Hampshire. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London&#x27;s efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable.

==Later life and death==
In 1624, Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the Low Countries against the Spanish. Shortly after their arrival, the earl&#x27;s eldest son, James Wriothesley, succumbed to an unspecified &quot;fever&quot; at Roosendaal. Five days later, on 10 November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at Bergen-op-Zoom, aged 51. Their remains were returned to England, and both men were buried in the family chapel of the parish church of Titchfield, Hampshire. The magnificent tomb features four prominent obelisks as well as kneeling relief figures of the youthful 3rd Earl and his sister. The Wriothesleys were still Catholic in the early 1590s when this tomb was built, as were the Montagus of Cowdray, whose closely related tomb featuring similarly positioned obelisks was dismantled and relocated from Midhurst to Easebourne in the 19th century (Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, was the 3rd Earl&#x27;s maternal grandfather). The four obelisks probably reference the four internationally celebrated Egyptian ones reerected by Pope Sixtus V in Rome in the 1580s.

He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the fourth Earl, who would become a prominent statesman and served as Lord High Treasurer under Charles II. That earl&#x27;s father in law was Francis Leigh, 1st Earl of Chichester whose family fortunes were secured by Sir Thomas Leigh, who married the heiresses of Sir Rowland Hill.

==Marriage and issue==
In August 1598, Southampton married Elizabeth Vernon, the daughter of John Vernon of Hodnet, Shropshire, and his wife Elizabeth Devereux, who was the aunt of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex – who is also connected with Elizabethan drama.

Devereux&#x27;s grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon. On her father John Vernon&#x27;s side, Elizabeth Vernon&#x27;s paternal ancestors were more obscure. The marriage was held secretly to legitimize an already-visible pregnancy, based on a letter of John Chamberlain in which he writes &quot;Mistress Vernon is from the court, and lies in Essex House. Some say she hath taken a venue under the girdle and swells upon it, yet she complains not of foul play but says the Earl of Southampton will justify it; and it is bruited underhand that he was lately here four days in great secret of purpose to marry her and effected it accordingly&quot;. Queen Elizabeth, angered by this marriage of one of her retinue without her permission, had both of the newlyweds imprisoned.

When Elizabeth was pregnant, she wrote to her husband asking him to buy her a stomacher of scarlet cloth lined with plush to keep her warm while riding. She also asked him to bring a portrait &#x27;very finely done&#x27;.

They had two sons and three daughters listed on his funeral certificate:
* Lady Penelope Wriothesley (18 November 1598 – 16 July 1667), who married William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton.
* Lady Anne Wriothesley (born 1600 – died 1662), who married Robert Wallop (20 July 1601 – 19 November 1667) of Farley Wallop, by whom she had issue; their great-grandson was John Wallop, 1st Earl of Portsmouth.
* James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley (1 March 1605 – 5 November 1624), who died of an unspecified &quot;fever&quot; five days before his father when they were fighting in the Low Countries; his father also died of fever.
* Thomas Wriothesley (10 March 1607 – 16 May 1667) who became the 4th Earl of Southampton and married firstly Rachel de Massue, daughter of Daniel de Massue, Seigneur de Ruvigny, by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth, Viscountess Campden (died 1679) and Rachel, Lady Russell.

==Portraits==
Numerous portraits of Southampton exist, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare&#x27;s description of &quot;a man right fair.&quot; Sir John Beaumont wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled &quot;Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex&quot; (1624).

In 2002, a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Portraying him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe portrait of Southampton.

In April 2008, another portrait believed to be of Southampton, was discovered hidden in a kind of &quot;pentimento&quot; beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition.

==In popular culture==
The Earl has been played on screen by several different actors:

<doc id="468804" wikidata="Q876802" url="?curid=468804" title="Cartel (rap group)">
<text>Cartel is a 1995 Turkish hip hop CD project involving three groups of rappers from different German cities, which received attention and popularity in both Turkey and Germany. It was notable for using samples of traditional Turkish music instruments in hip hop music. Cartel was the first Turkish-language project to get off the ground and often credited as the group that ignited &quot;Oriental hip hop&quot;.

During Cartel&#x27;s short career, the band gave around 120 extremely successful concerts in Turkey, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and France. Cartel is the only hip-hop group that managed to fill Istanbul&#x27;s İnönü Stadium (as of December 2006). In addition to German and Turkish-speaking media, BBC London also reported on the group, as did the music channels VIVA and MTV.

In Turkey, where the band, which also appears in English, Spanish and German, has remained most successful, Cartel has sold more than half a million CDs through official sales to date. On February 4, 2011 the group released their new album Bugünkü Neşen Cartel&#x27;den and their new video Bir Oluruz, but without Kabus Kerim.

<doc id="468806" wikidata="Q31079" url="?curid=468806" title="Port Said Governorate">
<text>Port Said Governorate () is a subdivision located at the northeast end of the Nile Delta, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea at the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. It is wholly urban, comprising the original Port Said city on the west bank of the Suez Canal, and the town of Port Fuad on the eastern bank, which makes it one of the few transcontinental metropolitans in the world, as it spans across two continents (Africa/Asia).

Port Said is one of six governorates that make up the Suez Canal economic region, and is the home of the Suez Canal Authority historical administrative building and the Lighthouse of Port Said.

==Geography==
In 2015 a huge natural gas reserve was discovered off the coast of Port Said and was described as &quot;the largest ever found in the Mediterranean Sea&quot;. Egypt now has one of the largest areas of natural gas and Italian company, ENI has been contracted to work on the natural gas liquefaction for Egypt. It was welcome news as Egypt has long suffered an energy crisis.

The New Suez Canal project launched in 2015 included dredging of the East Port Said Canal.

===East Port Said Industrial Zone===

Located on the Sinai side of the canal, Port Said East is a development project that contains the Suez Canal Container Terminal, which opened in 2004.

In November 2015, president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi publicly launched a new harbour development project at East Port Said.

A side canal at Port Said East was opened in 2016.

==Municipal divisions and demographics==
Port Said Governorate is divided into eight regions: The seven Port Said city districts &quot;(hayy)&quot; of Al-Sharq, Al-Arab, Al-Manakh, Al-Dawahi, Al-Janoub, Al-Zuhur, and West District, in addition to the district-town of Port Fuad.

These districts are further subdivided in to 11 qism (police ward) which had a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 789,241 people:

==Social unrest==
In February 2012, more than 70 people died in the Port Said Stadium Riot after a football match. Social unrest in early 2013 continued for at least two weeks. While protesting on March 5, 2013, protesters set fire to the governorate&#x27;s headquarters and several people were injured.

In October 2016, some Egyptians protested rent increases.

==Industrial zones in Port Said==
According to the Egyptian Governing Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), in affiliation with the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation, the following industrial zones are located in this governorate:
*The industrial zone C 1
*The industrial zone C 6
*The industrial zone C 11
*The Northwest Bortex 
*The industrial zone south of Port Said (Al Reswah)

===New urban community industrial zone===
* East Port Said

==Economy==

To promote trade, during his presidency, Anwar Sadat declared it a duty-free zone. Port Said Governorate is a major transit point for trade, importing and exporting millions of tons of goods each year. Tourism is also promoted for the region.

==Important sites==

There are several museums in this area. For cultural tourism one may want to visit the Port Said National Museum of Antiquities which opened in 1987 and is located at the confluence of the Suez Canal waters and the Mediterranean Sea. It houses about 9,000 artifacts from all eras, ranging from the Pharaonic, Greek, Roman, and modern eras, as well as Coptic and Islamic eras.
The Military Museum of Port Said, established in 1964, commemorates the 1956 the tripartite aggression on the city. It features armory and military artifacts, equipment used in the wars fought between 1956 - 1967 and in 1973. El Nasr Museum of Modern Art in Port Said opened on December 25, 1995, and includes artwork by Egyptian artists in various branches of Fine Art.

The Statue de Lesseps, honoring Ferdinand de Lesseps, the developer of the Suez and Panama Canals, has its base at the entrance to the Suez Canal, along Palestine Street, where passing ships come from all over the world. This makes it a favorite with tourists. Nearby, is the Suez Canal Authority building built on the banks of Port Said at the start of the project.

The lighthouse and jetties at Port Said, located at the northern terminus of the Suez canal, and completed in 1869, were built of concrete of Teil lime and Port Said sand. The lighthouse is a monolith 180 feet high. In the construction 120,000 tons of Teil hydraulic lime were used. It was an important engineering feat involving 25,000 blocks, each weighing twenty-five tons.

Tall al Faramah, also called Pelusium, is of Ecclesiastical and archeological importance. It is an archeological, prehistoric site with ruins and a Byzantine church.

In 2004, the marine sector of Egypt had 3,013 fishermen who were categorized in the recreational fishing sector, fishing in and around the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. &quot;Recreational fishing is widely practised along the Mediterranean Coast&quot;, where Port Said is located.
Tel Tennis is an island (also called Tinnis or Thenessus) located southwest of Port Said on Lake Manzala and can be reached from Port Said by boat.

One can find historic churches in Port Said Governorate. There is a Roman Church, established in 1926, a Melkite Greek Catholic Church called Saint Elias Greek Catholic Church, and an old French Cathedral.

<text>Damietta Governorate ( &quot;&quot; ) is one of the 27 governorates of Egypt. It is located in the northeastern part of the country, and has a population of over 1.3 million. The capital is the city of Damietta.

Damietta (city) is famous for its guava farms, as well as the palm trees that cover the coast from Ras El Bar in the east to Gamasa in the west. The governorate exports millions of palm trees to many countries every year, including Greece and China. Damietta also produces wheat, maize, cotton, rice, potatoes, lemons, grapes and tomatoes. It is also famous for its sweet industry, sardine packing, furniture industry and Domiati cheese. Ras El Bar, one of the oldest summer resorts in Egypt, is located at the point where the Nile river meets the Mediterranean Sea.

In August 2018, Manal Awad Mikhail was the first Coptic woman to be appointed as a governor in Egypt.

On 3 July 2024, the new governor of Damietta was Ayman el-Shahaby.

<text>Earl Temple of Stowe, in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1822 for Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, who was created Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos at the same time. In contrast to the Marquessate and Dukedom, which were created with remainder to the heirs male of his body only, the Earldom was created with remainder to (1) the heirs male of his body, failing which to (2) the heirs male of his deceased great-grandmother the 1st Countess Temple, failing which to (3) his granddaughter Lady Anna Grenville (daughter of Richard, Earl Temple, later 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos) and the heirs male of her body, and then to possible younger daughters of Lord Temple and the heirs male of their bodies (there were, in the event, no other daughters).

The Earldom remained merged with the Dukedom until the death of the 1st Duke&#x27;s grandson the 3rd Duke, when the Dukedom and four of its subsidiary titles became extinct (the Viscountcy and Barony of Cobham and the Lordship of Kinloss survived, however; see these titles for more information). The late Duke was succeeded in the Earldom of Temple of Stowe according to the special remainder by his nephew William Gore-Langton. He was the eldest son of the aforementioned Lady Anna Grenville and her husband William Gore-Langton. The latter was a descendant of Sir John Gore, Lord Mayor of London in 1624, whose elder brother Sir Paul Gore, 1st Baronet, was the ancestor of the Earls of Arran (1762 creation), the Barons Annaly (1766 and 1789 creations) and the Barons Harlech.

The 4th Earl Temple of Stowe had previously represented Mid Somerset in Parliament as a Conservative. In 1892 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Temple. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 5th Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the 6th Earl. He was the eldest son of Captain the Hon. Chandos Temple-Gore-Langton, second son of the 4th Earl. Chandos had two daughters. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the 7th Earl. He was a travelling salesman in Australia and did not use the title. He never married and was succeeded by his cousin, the 8th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Evelyn Arthur Grenville Temple-Gore-Langton, third and youngest son of the fourth Earl. Upon his death in 2013, he was succeeded by his son James. Lord Temple of Stowe is also in remainder to the Lordship of Kinloss.

There are no subsidiary titles held by the Earl. Consequently, the eldest son and heir of the Earl uses the invented title Lord Langton as a courtesy title.

The family seat from which the title derives was Stowe House in Buckinghamshire.

<text>South Sinai Governorate ( &quot;&quot;) is the least populated governorate of Egypt. It is located in the east of the country, encompassing the southern half of the Sinai Peninsula. Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, an Eastern Orthodox Church monastery and UNESCO World Heritage Site of world renown, is located in the central part of the governorate.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into the following municipal divisions for administrative purposes with a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 117,113.


==Tourism==
The governorate is an attractive destination for tourism due to its amazing and fascinating nature scenes; however, it has been the site of several terrorist attacks. In 1985, a mass murder occurred in the Ras Burqa resort and killed 8 people (7 Israeli tourists and 1 Egyptian policeman). The 2004 Sinai bombings that targeted tourist hotels in and around Nuweiba killed 34 people and wounded over 170. In 2005, Sharm El Sheikh was hit by a terrorist attack. 88 people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded, at that time making it the deadliest terrorist action in the country&#x27;s history (exceeding the Luxor massacre of 1997, which killed 62 people). 2006 saw the Dahab bombings, which killed 23 people and wounded 80.

The Sinai insurgency, although happening mainly in the neighboring North Sinai Governorate, has occasionally spilled over to South Sinai. In February 2014, a tourist bus was attacked in Taba. The perpetrators killed the Egyptian bus driver and three South Korean tourists. 

After 2014, The Egyptian government and the Egyptian army took firm actions to eliminate terrorism, and now the city is quite safe.

==Demographics==
According to population estimates, in 2024 the majority of residents in the governorate lived in urban areas, with an urbanization rate of 51.1%. Out of an estimated 117,113 people residing in the governorate, 59,845 people lived in urban areas as opposed to only 57,268 in rural areas. The Bedouin inhabit the Mount Sinai area. Due to poor accessibility, at times the orchards in the mountains have served to hide narcotics smugglers in the region.

==Landmarks==

Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, an Eastern Orthodox Church monastery and UNESCO World Heritage Site of world renown, is located in central part of the governorate, at the mouth of a gorge at the foot of Mount Sinai, in the city of Saint Catherine, Egypt. Built between 548 and 565, the monastery is one of the oldest working Christian monasteries in the world. The site contains the world&#x27;s oldest continually operating library, possessing many unique books including the Syriac Sinaiticus and, until 1859, the Codex Sinaiticus.

Raithu Monastery is situated in El Tor. It was built on a site where some 40 monks were massacred in the 4th or 5th century.

<text>Baron Templemore, of Templemore in the County of Donegal, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, since 1975 a subsidiary title of the Marquessate of Donegall. It was created on 10 September 1831 for Arthur Chichester, Member of Parliament for Milborne Port and County Wexford. He was the son of Lord Spencer Stanley Chichester, third son of The 1st Marquess of Donegall (see Marquess of Donegall for earlier history of the Chichester family). Lord Templemore&#x27;s son, the second Baron, and grandson, the third Baron, both served as Deputy Lieutenants of County Wexford. The latter was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. He served as the Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords between 1940 and 1945. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Baron. In 1975 he succeeded his kinsman as seventh Marquess of Donegall. For further history of the titles, see Marquess of Donegall.

Two other members of this branch of the Chichester family may also be mentioned. The Honourable Augustus George Charles Chichester (1822–1896), second son of the first Baron, was a Lieutenant-General in the 77th Foot. The Honourable Sir Gerald Henry Crofton Chichester (1886–1939), second son of the third Baron, was private secretary to Queen Mary between 1935 and 1939.

Despite the geographical designation &quot;Templemore in the County of Donegal&quot;, in 1831 the civil parish of Templemore was entirely in County Londonderry rather than in neighbouring County Donegal. The name &quot;Templemore&quot; originally designated the medieval cathedral of Derry, and later the parish west of the River Foyle served by the cathedral. A 1613 charter included the portion of the parish nearest the renamed city of Londonderry within the city&#x27;s northwest liberties and the new County Londonderry. Subsequently, the County Donegal portion of Templemore was made into separate parishes (Muff, Burt, and Inch).

==Barons Templemore (1831)==

*Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Templemore (1797–1837)
*Harry Spencer Chichester, 2nd Baron Templemore (1821–1906)
*Arthur Henry Chichester, 3rd Baron Templemore (1854–1924)
*Arthur Claud Spencer Chichester, 4th Baron Templemore (1880–1953)
*Dermot Richard Claud Chichester, 5th Baron Templemore (1916–2007) (succeeded as 7th Marquess of Donegall in 1975)
&quot;For further succession, see Marquess of Donegall&quot;.

<text>Sohag Governorate () is one of the governorates of Egypt. It is located in the southern part of the country (Upper Egypt), and covers a stretch of the Nile Valley. Since 1960, its capital has been the city of Sohag. Prior to that, the capital was the city of Girga and the name of the governorate was Girga Governorate.

== Overview ==

The rate of poverty is more than 60% in this governorate but recently some social safety networks have been provided in the form of financial assistance and job opportunities. The funding has been coordinated by the country&#x27;s Ministry of Finance and with assistance from international organizations.

In early 2019, some residents of the poorer villages of Sohag were able to move into their new homes built, in part, with aid from the National Bank of Kuwait. There was a celebration for the completion of 115 homes where residents also received cattle and other gifts.

==Archaeology==
In April 2019, the archaeological mission of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities led by Mostafa Waziri uncovered a tomb of a nobleman called Toutou and his wife at al-Dayabat archaeological site dating back to the Ptolemaic Kingdom. The tomb contained two tiny rooms with two limestone sarcophagi as well as a well-preserved mummy and mummified animals (including falcons, eagles, cats, dogs and shrews) were also revealed in the tomb.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into municipal divisions with a total estimated population as of January 2024 of 5,853,394. In the case of Sohag governorate, there are two new cities, five agsam and twelve marakiz. In some instances there is a markaz and a kism with the same name.
==Population==

According to population estimates, in 2024 the majority of residents in the governorate lived in rural areas, with an urbanization rate of only 21.4%. Out of an estimated 5,853,394 people residing in the governorate in 2024, 4,600,768 people lived in rural areas and 1,252,626 lived in urban areas.

<doc id="468829" wikidata="Q868947" url="?curid=468829" title="Thermal paste">
<text>Thermal paste (also called thermal compound, thermal grease, thermal interface material (TIM), thermal gel, heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste or CPU grease) is a thermally conductive (but usually not electrically conductive) chemical compound, which is commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources such as high-power semiconductor devices. The main role of thermal paste is to eliminate air gaps or spaces (which act as thermal insulation) from the interface area in order to maximize heat transfer and dissipation. Thermal paste is an example of a thermal interface material.

As opposed to thermal adhesive, thermal paste does not add mechanical strength to the bond between heat source and heat sink. It has to be coupled with a fastener such as screws to hold the heat sink in place and to apply pressure, spreading and thinning the thermal paste.

== Composition ==
Thermal paste consists of a polymerizable liquid matrix and large volume fractions of electrically insulating, but thermally conductive filler. Typical matrix materials are epoxies, silicones (silicone grease), urethanes, and acrylates; solvent-based systems, hot-melt adhesives, and pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes are also available. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, zinc oxide, diamond and increasingly aluminum nitride are used as fillers for these types of adhesives. The filler loading can be as high as 70–80% by mass, and raises the thermal conductivity of the base matrix from 0.17–0.3 W/(m·K) (watts per meter-kelvin) up to about 4 W/(m·K), according to a 2008 paper.

Silver thermal compounds may have a conductivity of 3 to 8 W/(m·K) or more, and consist of micronized silver particles suspended in a silicone/ceramic medium. However, metal-based thermal paste can be electrically conductive and capacitive; if some flows onto the circuits, it can lead to malfunction and damage.

The most effective (and most expensive) pastes consist almost entirely of liquid metal, usually a variation of the alloy galinstan, and have thermal conductivities in excess of 13 W/(m·K). These are difficult to apply evenly and have the greatest risk of causing malfunction due to spillage. Furthermore, these pastes contain gallium which is highly corrosive to aluminium and thus cannot be used on aluminium heat sinks.

== Uses ==
Thermal paste is used to improve the heat coupling between different components. A common application is to drain away waste heat generated by electrical resistance in semiconductor devices including power transistors, CPUs, GPUs, and LED COBs. Cooling these devices is essential because excess heat rapidly degrades their performance and can cause a runaway to catastrophic failure of the device due to the negative temperature coefficient property of semiconductors.

Factory PCs and laptopsalthough seldom tablets or smartphonestypically incorporate thermal paste between the top of the CPU case and a heat sink for cooling. Thermal paste is sometimes also used between the CPU die and its integrated heat spreader, though solder is sometimes used instead.

When a CPU heat spreader is coupled to the die via thermal paste, performance enthusiasts such as overclockers are able to, in a process known as &quot;delidding&quot;, pry the heat spreader, or CPU &quot;lid&quot;, from the die. This allows them to replace the thermal paste, which is usually of low-quality, with a thermal paste having greater thermal conductivity. Generally, liquid metal thermal pastes are used in such instances.

== Challenges ==
The consistency of thermal paste makes it susceptible to failure mechanisms distinct from some other thermal interface materials. A common one is pump-out, which is the loss of thermal paste from between the die and the heat sink due to their differing rates of thermal expansion and contraction. Over a large number of power cycles, thermal paste extrudes from between the die and heat sink, which eventually causes degradation of thermal performance inasmuch as there is less paste in place.

Another issue with some compounds is the separation of the polymer and filler matrix components occurs under high temperatures. The loss of polymeric material can result in poor wettability, leading to increased thermal resistance.

==Health hazards==
Zinc oxide emits toxic fumes that must not be inhaled and a particulate respirator is necessary for any use. The chemical is also highly toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term negative effects to aquatic environments.

On 30 July 2009, he became acting president after the retirement of President Josefa Iloilo. On 5 November 2009, he was sworn in as President of Fiji. George Konrote was elected to succeed him in October 2015.

On 11 February 2019, he became the newly appointed Speaker of the Fijian Parliament, winning 30 votes against 21 to Opposition nominee and Suva lawyer, Tanya Waqanika.

==Education and military career==
Born to a family of politically powerful chieftains, Nailatikau&#x27;s career spanned 20 years in the military and 17 years in the diplomatic service. Following his education at Bau District School, Draiba Fijian School, Levuka Public School and Queen Victoria School, Nailatikau trained as a soldier in New Zealand. In 1966, he served on secondment in the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment and was posted to Sarawak, Malaysia, during Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; against Malaysia. He proved to be a popular and highly respected officer. When he returned to the Fiji Infantry Regiment, he rose steadily through the ranks. By 1987, he held the rank of Brigadier-General, and was the Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces. While visiting Australia, he was deposed from this position, however, when the third-ranked officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka staged the first of two coups and seized power.

==Diplomatic career==
Nailatikau retired from the Army and decided to pursue a new career in the diplomatic service. After completing the Foreign Service Course at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and accredited as Fiji&#x27;s ambassador to Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Israel and the Holy See. He was later appointed Fiji&#x27;s roving ambassador and high commissioner to the member states of the South Pacific Forum, before taking up a post as Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs and External Trade in 1999.

==Political career==
In the aftermath of the failure of the Fiji coup of 2000, a coup which Nailatikau strongly opposed, he was nominated for the position of Prime Minister, to help rebuild Fiji&#x27;s shattered institutions. He withdrew his nomination, however, in favour of Laisenia Qarase, who was considered more of a consensus candidate, but became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Fijian Affairs in the interim Cabinet. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in August 2000. He was appointed again Deputy Prime Minister of Laisenia Qarase in 2001 and served until September 2001, when he was elected the Speaker. In 2001, after democracy had been restored in a general election, he defeated, by a vote of 41 to 29, Joeli Kalou for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he held until after the 2006 elections.

Following the coup d&#x27;état of 5 December 2006, he was sworn in as Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade in the new interim government of Prime Minister Commodore Frank Bainimarama on 8 January 2007.

He was nominated to become the new vice-president by the Fiji president Ratu Josefa Iloilo on 10 April 2007, but was rejected by the GCC. On 17 April 2009, after Fiji experienced a constitutional crisis, Ratu Epeli was appointed vice president.

Nailatikau served as interim Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Co-operation and Civil Aviation under Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, beginning in January 2007. On 23 September 2008, Bainimarama said that Nailatikau would be moved to the post of Minister for Provincial Development and Multi-Ethnic Affairs on 5 October 2008, while Bainimarama would take over his previous duties. According to Bainimarama, he &quot;decided to give him this new responsibility given his extensive knowledge and hands-on experience on the workings of the Civil Service, Governments role in rural development and the sources of assistances available to facilitate such development&quot;, while also stating that Nailatikau had &quot;excellent public relations appeal, which is very much needed in outreaching and inter-facing with rural people.&quot;

===Acting prime minister===
On 25 September 2007, Epeli was appointed acting prime minister while interim Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, was away in New York for the week.

===Acting president===
On 30 July 2009, he became acting president after the retirement of 88-year-old President Iloilo. The president was supposed to be appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs (effectively abolished by the military-backed regime) under the 1997 constitution that Iloilo had abrogated, but Bainimarama announced that a new president would be appointed by his cabinet at the regime&#x27;s convenience. Nailatikau was formally appointed to the office on 5 November 2009.

==Anti-AIDS campaigner==
On 14 June 2005, Nailatikau was appointed the UNAIDS special representative for the Pacific. According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, he was chosen because his political position, his respect throughout the Pacific region, and his outspokenness on AIDS-related issues. He had previously served as a UNAIDS Pacific spokesman, and in October 2004 chaired the first conference of Pacific Parliamentarians on the Role of Pacific Parliamentarians in the fight against HIV/AIDS, in Suva.

Nailatikau&#x27;s outspoken calls to tackle the AIDS crisis have attracted controversy. On 22 November 2005, he called on people to recognise the reality that promiscuity existed, and that safe sex needed to be promoted to combat the associated AIDS risk. It was unrealistic to deny promiscuity and just promote abstinence, he considered, adding that this was a matter of life and death. He also called on churches to face the reality that promiscuity existed among their own congregations, and to meet the problem &quot;head on&quot; and play a part in promoting the use of condoms.

He represented the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) at the World AIDS Conference in Toronto in August 2006.

==Personal life==
As a chief by birth through his paternal side via his maternal grandmother, who is the granddaughter of Ratu Seru Cakobau, Epeli Nailatikau has the title of &quot;Ratu&quot;. He is the second son of Ratu Edward Cakobau, who commanded the Fijian Battalion in World War II. He is also a great-great-grandson of Seru Epenisa Cakobau from his granddaughter Litia Cakobau, the first monarch to rule over a unified Fijian kingdom after conquering all the tribes of Fiji and uniting them under his leadership, and who ceded the Fiji Islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. In addition, he is a grandson of King George Tupou II of Tonga. His father is the product of issue between King George Tupou II and Litia Cakobau who was sent to Tonga as a trial bride to the King but this was later repudiated as they could not marry under the normal Tongan constitution.

In 1981, he married Adi Koila Mara, the second daughter of modern Fiji&#x27;s former prime minister and president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Adi Koila has also been a politician; like her husband, she was a Member of Parliament, Cabinet minister, and Senator. They have two children: a son, Kamisese Vuna (named after Adi Koila&#x27;s father), and a daughter, Litia Cakobau.

<doc id="468832" wikidata="Q1277064" url="?curid=468832" title="Earl Granville">
<text>Earl Granville is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It is now held by members of the Leveson-Gower family.

==First creation==
The first creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1715 when Grace Carteret, Lady Carteret, was made Countess Granville and Viscountess Carteret. She was the daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath, and the widow of George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret. The Carteret family descended from the celebrated royalist statesman George Carteret, who had been created a baronet, of Melesches, Jersey, in 1645. It was later intended that he should be elevated to the peerage but he died before the title could be granted. As his eldest son, Philip, predeceased him, the peerage was eventually bestowed on his namesake grandson, George, who was made Baron Carteret, of Hawnes in the County of Bedford, in 1681, with remainder to his brothers.

Lord Carteret and Lady Granville were both succeeded by their son, the second Earl. He was a prominent statesman, mainly known under the title Lord Carteret. The titles became extinct in 1776 on the death of his son, the third Earl, without heirs. The Carteret estates were passed on to the late Earl&#x27;s first cousin, the Hon. Henry Frederick Thynne, second son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth, and his wife Lady Louisa Carteret, daughter of the second Earl Granville. He assumed the surname of Carteret and was created Baron Carteret in 1784.

==Second creation==

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1833 when the noted diplomat Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Viscount Granville, was made Earl Granville and Baron Leveson, of Stone Park in the County of Stafford. He had already been created Viscount Granville, of Stone Park in the County of Stafford, in 1815. Leveson-Gower was the son of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, by his third wife, Susanna. He was the younger half-brother of George Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland, and the uncle of Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere. He was also a great-great-nephew of the aforementioned Grace Carteret, 1st Countess Granville. Hence, the 1833 creation of the earldom of Granville was a revival of the title created in 1715.

Lord Granville was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a prominent Liberal politician and served three times as Foreign Secretary. His son, the third Earl, was also a diplomat and notably served as Ambassador to Belgium from 1928 to 1933. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and also served as Governor of Northern Ireland from 1945 to 1952. Lord Granville married Lady Rose Constance Bowes-Lyon, second surviving daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and elder sister of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, wife of George VI.

, the titles are held by his grandson, the sixth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1996.

The Hon. Frederick Leveson-Gower, younger son of the first Earl, was Member of Parliament for Derby, Stoke-upon-Trent and Bodmin. His son George Leveson-Gower was also a Member of Parliament.

The family seat is Callernish House, near Lochmaddy, North Uist.

<text>North Sinai Governorate ( &quot;&quot;) is one of the governorates of Egypt. It is located in the north-eastern part of the country, and encompasses the northern half of the Sinai Peninsula. It is bordered in the north by the Mediterranean Sea, in the south by South Sinai Governorate, in the west by Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez Governorates, and in the east by the Gaza Strip in Palestine (Rafah Governorate) and Israel (Southern District). Its capital is the city of El Arish. A governorate is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the President of Egypt and serves at the president&#x27;s discretion.

North Sinai has a rich history dating back to ancient times and is home to several ancient settlements that hold significant historical and Biblical importance – Ostrakine and Kasion, both of which served as a border city between Egypt and Syria and an important bishopric in the Byzantine era; Kadesh Barnea, an important site, with its history tied to the events described in the Bible.

The population of the North Sinai Governorate as at 2015 was 434,781 people, comprising predominantly Bedouin tribesmen. The Governorate covers an area of 27,574 square kilometers. The population density is 15 inhabitants per square kilometer.

North Sinai has since 2011 been especially affected by the Sinai insurgency and measures by government forces to combat it, which has resulted in many casualties. On October 14, 2016, twelve Egyptian troops were killed at a checkpoint near El Arish. On November 27, 2017, a mosque in the village of Al-Rawda was attacked by roughly 40 gunmen, killing at least 305 and injuring up to 128 others, making it the deadliest terror attack in Egyptian history.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into municipal divisions for administrative purposes with a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 504,201.


==Population==

According to population estimates, in 2024 the majority of residents in the governorate lived in urban areas, with an urbanization rate of 60.2%. Out of an estimated total of 450,531 people, 261,219 people lived in urban areas and 179,312 lived in rural areas.

<doc id="468835" wikidata="Q982707" url="?curid=468835" title="John Florio">
<text>Giovanni Florio (1552 or 1553 – 1625), known as John Florio, was an English linguist, poet, writer, translator, lexicographer, and royal language tutor at the Court of James I. He is recognised as the most important Renaissance humanist in England. Florio contributed 1,149 words to the English language, placing third after Chaucer (with 2,012 words) and Shakespeare (with 1,969 words), in the linguistic analysis conducted by Stanford professor John Willinsky.

Florio was the first translator of Montaigne into English, possibly the first translator of Boccaccio into English and he wrote the first comprehensive Italian–English dictionary (surpassing the only previous modest Italian–English dictionary by William Thomas published in 1550).

Playwright and poet Ben Jonson was a personal friend, and Jonson hailed Florio as &quot;loving father&quot; and &quot;ayde of his muses&quot;. Philosopher Giordano Bruno was also a personal friend; Florio met the Italian philosopher in London, while both of them were residing at the French embassy. Bruno wrote and published in London his six most celebrated moral dialogues, including &quot;La cena de le ceneri&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;, 1584), in which Florio is mentioned as Bruno&#x27;s companion.

John Florio worked as tutor to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton; from 1604 he became Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Anne, until her death in 1619. Later in his life, Florio was patronised by William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, whom he bequeathed his library.

Many of the intertextual borrowings by Shakespeare from Florio&#x27;s works have been long attested, and assumptions have been made to claim secret connections between Florio and Shakespeare, even asserting a putative identity of Florio with the author of Shakespeare&#x27;s works.

==Early life==
John Florio was born in London in 1552 or 1553 but he grew up and lived in continental Europe until the age of 19. The only portrait of Florio we have, the frontispiece to the &quot;New World of Words&quot; of 1611, presents him as &quot;Italus ore, Anglus pector&quot; (&quot;Italian in mouth, English in chest&quot;); glosses this as, &quot;in his native language an Italian, in his heart an Englishman,&quot; and interprets Florio&#x27;s declaration that &quot;I am an Englishman in Italian&quot; to mean that he was &quot;an Englishman with an Italian inflection or streak&quot;.

=== His father Michelangelo ===

John&#x27;s father, Michelangelo Florio, born in Tuscany, had been a Franciscan friar before converting to the Protestant faith. He was a fervent Protestant with Jewish ancestors. He got into trouble with the Inquisition in Italy, after preaching in Naples, Padua, and Venice. Seeking refuge in England during the reign of Edward VI, he was appointed pastor of the Italian Protestant congregation in London in 1550. He was also a member of the household of William Cecil. He was dismissed from both on a charge of immorality, but William Cecil later fully forgave him. Little is known of Florio&#x27;s mother, she was a servant in the house of Cecil and John Aubrey confirms she was Italian, writing in his &quot;Brief Lives&quot; that Florio&#x27;s Italian &quot;father and mother flew from the Valtolin (region) to London for religion&quot; reasons and Aubrey says &quot;the information was from Florio&#x27;s grandson, Mr. Molins&quot;. Furthermore, in First Fruits, John Florio asserted that when he arrived in London (at 19 years old), he didn&#x27;t know the language and asked in Italian or French &quot;where the post dwelt. He later explained that he learnt the language by reading books.

Michelangelo Florio then became Italian tutor to Lady Jane Grey and in the family of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, father of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke who would become the husband of Mary Sidney, sister of Philip Sidney. He dedicated a book to Henry Herbert and Jane Grey, his highest-ranking pupils: &quot;Regole de la lingua thoscana&quot; (&quot;Rules of the Tuscan language&quot;). Lady Jane Grey&#x27;s youth, faith, and death affected him deeply and later, in seclusion, in Soglio, in Italian-speaking Switzerland, he wrote a book about her life, titled &quot;Historia de la vita e de la morte de L&#x27;Illlustriss. Signora Giovanna Graia&quot;, published later in 1607. In the preface of the book, the anonymous publisher explained that the original book was written &quot;by his own hand by the author&quot; and it was found &quot;after his death, in the home of an honored and great benefactor.&quot; It is also explained that Michalangelo &quot;would certainly have had this book published in that he had not been prevented from very cruel persecutions. He in fact deposed it for fifty years in safe hands&quot;. He describes Lady Jane Grey as a martyr and innocent &quot;saint&quot;. It is possible that he had witnessed some of the events surrounding her or had told her about the persecutions in Italy.

==Exile==

When Mary Tudor ascended to the throne in 1554, she re-established Catholicism in England and Ireland. In February 1554, a royal edict proclaimed that all foreigners had to depart the realm within twenty-four days. Consequently, on 4 March 1554, Michelangelo and his family, which included infant John, left England. In Strasbourg, the generous citizens offered themselves to give a first temporary refuge to the exiles for twenty days. Here, Michelangelo had a first meeting with the noble Frederik von Salis, coming from Soglio, who invited him to become pastor of the Reformed Evangelical Church of Graubünden in Soglio. Soglio was remote from the Inquisition and was situated near Chiavenna (north of Lake Como in Italy), a centre of Reformed preaching. In the first years of John&#x27;s infancy, Michelangelo worked as pastor and notary, educating his son in an environment rich in religious and theological ferment. In addition, he taught John Italian, as well as Latin, Hebrew and Greek. Michelangelo Florio died in 1566, after this date his name is no longer mentioned and in the synod of 1571 he is mentioned as a deceased person. When he was ten, John Florio was sent to live with and to be schooled in a Paedagogium in Tübingen (Germany) by the Reformed Protestant theologian, Pier Paolo Vergerio, a native of Venetian Capodistria (who had also lived in Swiss Bregaglia). Under these circumstances, John was formed in the humanist cultural circle of Tübingen, in a strong Italianate atmosphere. Unfortunately, he never completed his studies. Vergerio, in fact, died in 1566. Without any financial support, and orphan at 14 years old, he left Tübingen. He came back to Soglio, and later departed for England in the early 1570s, in possession of a formidable Christian Reformed and humanist education.

== London: &quot;First Fruits&quot; &amp; Leicester&#x27;s Men (1571–1578) ==

=== First marriage ===
At about 19 years old, after his formative years in Soglio and in Tübingen, John Florio came back to London. Ascribed to the Italian church, John worked for some years as silk dyer and servant of Michel Baynard. In addition, he worked for the Venetian merchant Gaspare Gatti, living in the wool-dyers&#x27; district of London. At 21 years old he married an Italian woman, Anna Soresollo; they had five children: Annebelle, Joane, Edward, Aurelia and Elizabeth. It has been wrongly suggested by Anthony Wood that John married Samuel Daniel&#x27;s sister. No record of their marriage has so far been discovered, and Wood&#x27;s suggestion was probably mainly due to Daniel&#x27;s dedication lines in the 1613 second edition of Florio&#x27;s translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; in which he referred to him as his &quot;brother&quot;, suggesting a long-time friendship, more than an actual kinship between them. However, it is possible that it was John&#x27;s sister, Justina, who married Samuel Daniel. Robert Anderson, in &quot;The Works of the British Poets&quot; (1795), states that Daniel &quot;left no issue by his wife Justina, sister of John Florio.&quot;

=== &quot;First Fruits&quot; ===
At 25 years old John Florio published &quot;Firste Fruites which yeelde familiar speech, merie prouerbes, wittie sentences, and golden sayings. Also a perfect induction to the Italian, and English tongues, as in the table appeareth. The like heretofore, neuer by any man published&quot; (1578). This collection of dramatic dialogues contains translated passages from literature and philosophy. Moreover, it is designed for novices in both the Italian and English language. Florio inscribed the manual to &quot;All Italian gentlemen and merchants who delight in the English tongue&quot;. He dedicated his first work to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. In the dedication, John reminded Dudley of his father&#x27;s faithful service, successfully entering his social circle.

In the manual, John Florio refers to himself as &quot;povero artigiano&quot; (poor artisan). His insistence upon the fact that teaching was not his profession indicates that this was the very first time he approached the languages as a profession. In addition, the commendatory verses that precede &quot;Firste Fruites&quot; show that John Florio got in contact with the Dudley&#x27;s theatre company: The Leicester&#x27;s men. The first pages of the &quot;First Fruits,&quot; in fact, contain various commendatory verses written by the company actors: Richard Tarlton, Robert Wilson, Thomas Clarke, and John Bentley. They thank him for having contributed to bring the Italian novelist to the English theatre.

With &quot;Firste Fruites,&quot; John Florio began a new career in London in language instruction while having contacts with the theatre.

== Oxford: Euphuism &amp; Cartier&#x27;s Voyages (1578–1582) ==

=== Oxford ===
By the summer of 1578, he was sent by Lord Burleigh, William Cecil, to Magdalen College, Oxford. He entered as a poor scholar and became servant and tutor in Italian to Barnabe and Emmanuel Barnes, sons of the Bishop of Durham. John Florio remained at Oxford at least until 1582. Magdalen College today commemorates his time there with the John Florio Society that meets to appreciate its members&#x27; own poems.

=== Euphuism ===
During these years John matured as a lexicographer and made the development of modern English language his primary mission. Firstly, he became tutor in Italian to John Lyly. As the author considered to be the first English prose stylist to leave an enduring impression upon the language, Lyly was a key figure of Euphuism. Another Euphuist and pupil of John Florio was Stephen Gosson. Both Gosson and Lyly adopted the Euphuistic style and were saturated in Italian reading through John Florio&#x27;s lessons. It is possible that another Euphuist, George Pettie, was the &quot;I.P.&quot; who signed the Italian verses that prefaced the &quot;First Fruits&quot;.

=== Cartier&#x27;s Voyages ===
In Oxford, beside his job as Italian tutor, John Florio also began a career as translator. He met Richard Hakluyt, an English writer who was very passionate about maritime literature. His collaboration with Florio was very fruitful: he commissioned him to translate Jacques Cartier&#x27;s voyage to Canada. Later, in 1580, Florio published his translation under the name &quot;: first translated out of French into Italian by that famous learned man Gio : Bapt : Ramutius, and now turned into English by John Florio; worthy the reading of all venturers, travellers, and discoverers&quot;. Florio quickly developed an awareness of the potential of the &#x27;New World&#x27;, he advocates &quot;planting&quot; the &quot;New-found land&quot; four years before Hakluyt and Raleigh, the pioneers of colonisation. He threw himself early into the spirit of these English patriotic ventures. Furthermore, he committed himself to both refine the English language and be a contributor of England&#x27;s colonial enterprise.

== At the French Embassy (1583–1585) ==
Between the summer of 1583 and 1585 John Florio moved with his family to the French embassy. It was situated in London, at Beaumont House, Butcher Row. The French ambassador at the time was Michel de Castelnau, Lord of Mauvissière. Castelnau employed Florio for two years as a tutor in languages to his daughter Catherine Marie. Secondly, he also employed him &quot;in other honourable employment&quot;, in the discharge of which duties he &quot;bore himself prudently, honestly and faithfully&quot;. As a result, Florio earned the warm commendation of his master and all the household. His duties, beside that of tutor, translator and interpreter, were of personal secretary and legal representative of the ambassador when the latter departed from London.

=== The Babington Plot ===
During the captivity of Mary, Queen of Scots, several attempts were made to place her on the English throne. The most significant of these was the Babington Plot, which ultimately led to Mary&#x27;s trial and execution in 1587. William Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; was written one year after Florio&#x27;s death, in 1626 and it contains references to Florio&#x27;s involvement in the conspiracy of Babington of 1586. Walsingham, also thanks to Florio&#x27;s help, as suggested by Vaughan, was able to intercept and decode Mary&#x27;s correspondence.

=== &quot;A Letter Lately Written from Rome&quot; (1585) ===
At the French embassy, John Florio also embarked in a new, pioneering job as translator of news. In the Elizabethan England this trend had a tremendous demand, and quickly became a class of literature. Newspapers were not yet born. Even so, Florio intuitively began to translate several Italian newsletters that had been dispatched from Rome to France, turning them into novels. The resulting pamphlet was published in 1585 entitled &quot;A letter lately written from Rome, by an Italian gentleman to a freende of his in Lyons in Fraunce&quot;, and signed I.F.

Translated from Italian, Florio dedicated it to Henry Stanley, the Earl of Derby.

It has been pointed out that no original document titled &quot;A letter lately written from Rome&quot; exist and that the work was written or at least compiled by Florio himself who borrowed news from Italy, edited them, and created an entirely different piece of work to adapt it to an English audience.

=== Giordano Bruno &amp; &quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot; ===
Living with Giordano Bruno was the most important experience Florio had at the French Embassy. Bruno&#x27;s influence will have a huge impact upon him. The philosopher, undoubtedly shaped Florio&#x27;s character changing his vision of life and world permanently. John Florio embraced Bruno&#x27;s philosophy, and above all, the thesis upon the infinite universe and the possibility of life on other planets, theories which went well beyond the Copernican limited heliocentric world.

Bruno received many attacks after the quarrel and tumultuous period that followed the &quot;Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;. During that party he discussed his revolutionary theories, and after that, he got into a quarrel with the guests who didn&#x27;t receive with favour his ideas. Undoubtedly, Florio and Castelnau always defended him. Bruno described the event in a philosophical pamphlet written in Italian the same year: &quot;La cena de le ceneri&quot; (&quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot;, London, 1584).

The friendship that linked Bruno and Florio is particularly rich and significant. Florio in fact appears in &quot;The Ash Wednesday Supper&quot; as one of the messengers that brings to Bruno the invitation to dinner by Fulke Greville. In another scene Bruno and Florio are on a boat at night. They burst into song chanting stanzas from Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. Bruno would later portray him as &quot;Eliotropo&quot; in &quot;De la causa, principio et uno&quot; (Concerning Causality, Principle and Unity, London, 1584). In &quot;De l&#x27;infinito, universo e mondi&quot; (On The Infinite Universe and Worlds, London, 1584), fifth dialogue, Bruno adds Florio as &quot;Elpino&quot; and Alberico Gentili as &quot;Albertino&quot;.

Similarly, Florio returned the compliment by introducing the figure of Bruno, &quot;Il Nolano&quot; (from Nola near Naples), in &quot;Second Fruits&quot; (1591). He portrayed him lounging on a window-seat, leafing through a book and poking fun at his friend John for taking too much time over getting dressed in the morning. The portrait painted by Florio is undoubtedly that of a friend. Bruno surely appears in his pages in a positive light, like a satirical and healthy whip of pedants.

Florio will never forget Giordano Bruno, even after the long years of the trial and their tragic outcome at the stake. For instance, in 1603, John Florio, in the preface of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, recalled his old &quot;fellow Nolano&quot;, who had taught him the cultural value of translations. Moreover, in 1611, he listed Bruno&#x27;s Italian works among the texts he used for the composition of the dictionary.

Bruno&#x27;s scholars Gentile and Vincenzo Spampanato have both proved Florio&#x27;s indebtedness to the philosopher&#x27;s writings. Many of Bruno&#x27;s thoughts are undeniably shaped in Florio&#x27;s work &quot;Second Fruits.&quot; Also, in his two dictionaries Florio added many terms as well as Neapolitan dialect words taken from Bruno&#x27;s works.

== &quot;Second Fruits&quot; (1591) ==
Second Fruits is John Florio&#x27;s second work. Entitled &quot;Second Frutes to be gathered of twelve trees, of diverse but delightful tastes to the tongues of Italian and English&quot; (1591), it appeared thirteen years after the publication of the &quot;First Fruits&quot;, and is a product of perhaps the most interesting period of his life. The dedicatory epistle is a &quot;remarkably comprehensive sketch of current publication in the various fields of journalism, poetry, and the drama.&quot; The Epistle to the reader of the &quot;Second Fruits&quot; shows that Florio had recently been meeting with adverse criticism because of his Italian sympathies: &quot;As for me, for it is I, and I am an Englishman in Italiane; I know they haue a knife at command to cut my throate, Un Inglese Italianato é un Diavolo Incarnato.&quot;

Defining himself an &quot;Englishman in Italiane&quot;, John Florio writes a two-fold defence of Italian culture in England and of the practise of translation. The Epistle Dedicatorie shows that Florio knew that his &quot;Second Fruits&quot; was a provocative work, and here for the first time he signs himself with the adjective that stuck to him through life and after death: Resolute John Florio. Unlike his earlier manual, Florio&#x27;s &quot;Second Fruits&quot; is prefaced by a single commendatory sonnet: &quot;Phaeton to his friend Florio&quot;. This is one of the earliest Elizabethan sonnets to be printed, and was published in the &quot;Second Fruits&quot;, an Italian language book which contains a heterogeneous stock of raw materials for contemporary sonneteers.

=== Giardino di Ricreatione ===
Proverbs were a usual feature of most Elizabethan language lesson books, but in no manual did they play such an all-important part as in the &quot;Second Fruits&quot;. The proverbs of the book are, in fact, keyed with those published in a corollary work by Florio, the &quot;Giardino di Ricreatione&quot;: six thousands Italian proverbs, without their English equivalents. It is one of the most important of the earlier collections of this kind. The title itself is interesting: &quot;Giardino di ricreatione, nel quel crescono fronde, fiori e frutti, vaghe, leggiadri e soavi; sotto nome di auree sentenze, belli proverbii, et piacevoli riboboli, tutti Italiani, colti, scelti, e scritti, per Giovanni Florio, non solo utili ma dilettevoli per ogni spirito vago della Nobil lingua Italiana. Il numero d&#x27;essi é di 3400&quot;. The proverbs in the Italian side of the dialogues are starred to indicate that they are listed among the six thousand Italian proverbs collected in the &quot;Giardino&quot;.

== Tutor to Henry Wriothesley ==
It is not certain when John Florio took the role of tutor to Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton. Countess Clara Longworth de Chambrun was the first to suggest that Florio had been tutoring the Southampton before 1590. She points out that in &quot;Second Fruits&quot; (1591), there is a dialogue between John Florio and Henry, they play tennis together and go to see a play at theatre.

For Frances Yates too, this identification meets with some support from the fact that in the dialogue John quotes the proverb &quot;Chi si contenta gode&quot;, which is the motto on Florio&#x27;s portrait. Moreover, the topics touched on in the Second Fruits, like primero, the theatre, love, and tennis, represent Southampton&#x27;s tastes. Florio&#x27;s entrance into this brilliant literary circle closely associated with the drama, marks a very important stage in his career.

When he published his first dictionary, &quot;A World of Words&quot;, in 1598, Florio dedicated his laborious work to Henry: &quot;In truth I acknowledge an entyre debt, not onely of my best knowledge, but of all, yea of more then I know or can, to your bounteous Lordship most noble, most vertuous, and most Honorable Earle of Southampton, in whose paie and patronage I have lived some yeeres; to whom I owe and vowe the yeeres I have to live. But as to me, and manie more the glorious and gracious sunne-shine of your Honor hath infused light and life: so may my lesser borrowed light, after a principall respect to your benigne aspect, and influence, afforde some lustre to some others.&quot;

=== Danvers–Long feud ===
On Friday 4 October 1594, John Florio took part in the famous Danvers case, backing Henry&#x27;s friends in their efforts to escape. Henry Danvers and Sir Charles Denvers were the two elder sons of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey. Both close friends to Henry Wriothesley, they committed a crime in Wiltshire. According to one account, Henry Long was dining in the middle of the day with a party of friends in Cosham, when Henry Danvers, followed by his brother Charles and a number of retainers, burst into the room, and shot Long dead on the spot. According to another account, Henry Long had challenged Charles Danvers, that he was pressing an unfair advantage and had his arm raised to kill. When Henry Danvers thrust himself between to ward off the blow, was wounded in the act, and striking upwards with his dagger killed Henry Long accidentally.

Master Lawrence Grose, Sheriff, was informed on the murder, and on the evening of 12 October the following scene took place at Itchen&#x27;s Ferry: &quot;The said Grose, passing over Itchen’s Ferry with his wife that Saturday 12th, one Florio an Italian, and one Humphrey Drewell a servant of the Earl, being in the said passage boat threatened to cast Grose overboard, and said they would teach him to meddle with their fellows, with many other threatening words.&quot;

John Florio had a close relationship with Henry Wriothesley at least until 1603, when Henry&#x27;s family, Florio and other friends of the Southampton, flocked to him when he was released from the Tower.

== &quot;A World of Words&quot; (1598) ==
While he was engaged in the service of Henry Wriothesley, Florio produced a work which remains a landmark in the history of Italian scholarship in England. &quot;A Worlde of Wordes, or Dictionarie of the Italian and English tongues&quot; (London, 1598) is an Italian–English Dictionary, and, as such, only the second of its kind in England and much fuller than the short work published by William Thomas in the 1550s – with 44,000 words as opposed to Thomas&#x27;s 6,000.

Published by Edward Blount, and dedicated to Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, this work marked Florio as a scholar of the first magnitude. In the Epistle Dedicatorie John Florio celebrates the Italian language; however, his attitude towards English language is now changed. If in &quot;First Fruits&quot; he found the language &quot;besitted with manu languages&quot; now he has moved a step nearer appreciating what he now defines the &quot;sweete-mother-toonge&quot; of his native land.

The cited sources that follow the &quot;Epistle Dedicatorie&quot; of 1598 include a corpus that is made up mostly of contemporary literary texts, ranging from Sannazaro&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; and Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; to Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Cortegiano&quot;, Della Casa&#x27;s &quot;Galateo&quot;, and Caro&#x27;s &quot;Lettere famigliari&quot;, as well as wide range of Dialoghi such as those written by Sperone Speroni and Stefano Guazzo.

Fourteen citations alone or one-sixth of the catalogue are sources from Pietro Aretino, highlighting Florio&#x27;s interest in theatrical texts and his willingness to capitalise on his English readers&#x27; salacious interest in Aretino&#x27;s explicitly erotic and sexual content. Florio was shrewd enough to realise that if his Italian-English dictionary drew much of its vocabulary from such a popular author as Aretino, it would be well received by all those who wished to study first-hand Aretino&#x27;s lashing satire, bawdy language, and journalistic style.

&quot;A World of Words&quot; is a work of art in itself; the dictionary is an extraordinary resource not only for the history of Italian in Italy and abroad, but also for the history of early Modern English. It is a work that brings together the author&#x27;s three major roles: Florio as the plurilingual reader and word collector; Florio as teacher of Italian language and culture, as a grammarian and paroemiologist; and Florio as translator and creative writer.

== Shakespeare&#x27;s use of Florio ==
Numerous scholars have highlighted the great influence of Florio&#x27;s translation of Michel de Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that &quot;Shakespeare was Montaigne’s best reader&quot;. Scholars like Jonathan Bate and William M. Hamlin have noticed that Florio&#x27;s translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; had an impact on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, before the published translation appeared and they claim Shakespeare knew the translation before publication, but not providing any explanation or proof how it was possible that Shakespeare knew the translated work before the publication. F. O. Matthiessen, in his analysis of Florio&#x27;s translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, suggested the similarity between Florio&#x27;s and Shakespeare&#x27;s style, concluding that &quot;Shakespeare and Florio were constantly talking with the same people, hearing the same theories, breathing the same air.&quot;

Florio&#x27;s biographer Clara Longworth de Chambrun made an extensive analysis of Florio&#x27;s dramatic dialogues of &quot;First Fruits,&quot; &quot;Second Fruits&quot; and passages from Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, doing a comparison with Shakespeare&#x27;s dialogues and pointing out some similarities between the two writers. Further textual and linguistic analysis was performed by Rinaldo C. Simonini, who compared Florio&#x27;s dramatic dialogues of &quot;First Fruits&quot; and &quot;Second Fruits&quot; with Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

== Groom of the Privy Chamber (1604–1619) ==

=== Florio &amp; Queen Anne ===
With the accession of James I John Florio&#x27;s life at court begins a new chapter. He became Groom of the Privy Chamber, lived at court, and had a prestigious position at the centre of power. From 1604 to Queen Anne&#x27;s death in 1619 he had a secure income, and his life was on a steadier course.

Florio&#x27;s duties and his influence over the Queen at court emerge from various official documents. First, he became reader in Italian to Queen Anne and one of the grooms of her privy chamber. In a document dated March 1619 there is a list of Queen Anne&#x27;s &quot;Grooms of the Privy Chamber&quot; with the length of their service and the amounts of their yearly salary. In this Florio is stated to have served her for fifteen years at a salary of one hundred pounds per annum. This makes 1604 the year in which John Florio began his court service. A groom&#x27;s salary was sixty pounds per annum. The higher rate in Florio&#x27;s case seems to have been due to his additional functions as reader in Italian and private secretary to the Queen. He also wrote her letters and interviewed people for her. In addition to his attendance on the Queen, John Florio was also tutor in Italian and French to Prince Henry at court. In November 1606 Anne of Denmark gave him a valuable cup as a present at the christening of his grandchild, bought from the goldsmith John Williams.

==== Diplomatic affairs ====
Ottaviano Lotti, a representative of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in London, wrote to Florio in August 1606 for help to buy hunting dogs to present to Anne of Denmark, keeping the gift a secret from Jane Drummond, an influential gentlewoman in Anne of Denmark&#x27;s household. From Lotti&#x27;s dispatches, we know that John Florio had a major and confidential role with the Queen at court. This throws a flood of light upon Florio&#x27;s position with the Queen, which turns out to have been much more important than has hitherto been guessed.

Florio was also in close contact with Giovanni Carlo Scaramelli, Secretary to the Signoria; their relationship was important as it determined the political relationship between Venice and London at the time. Other ambassadors Florio got in contact with are Zorzi Giustinian, ambassador of Venice in London from January 1606 to 1608, Nicolò Molin, Henry Wotton, and many others. This diplomatic partnership between London and Venice, the English and Venetian agents and ambassadors, had John Florio as the crucial link between the two worlds.

==== Ben Jonson ====
Another of Florio&#x27;s tasks at court was to interview and select musicians, often Italian ones, who were seeking an introduction at court. Ottaviano Lotti, for example, in 1606 asked Florio to assist with his influence a musician, who wishes to obtain employment at court. They arranged a supper-party with the idea of inducing Florio to introduce the musician and his lyre at court. This shows not only another accomplishment Florio added in his career, but also another talent: his musical competence. The importance and influence which Florio&#x27;s established reputation and his court position gave him are illustrated by the fact that books were now dedicated to him. These dedications reveal that he had some association during these years with Nicholas Breton, Ben Jonson, and Thomas Thorpe. John Florio&#x27;s friendship with Ben Jonson is of great interest and importance. It is well-attested by an inscription written in Ben&#x27;s own hand upon the fly-leaf of a copy of &quot;Volpone&quot; which is now in the British Museum: &quot;To his louing Father, &amp; worthy Freind, Mr John Florio: The ayde of his Muses. Ben: Jonson seales this testemony of Freindship, &amp; Loue.&quot; The word &quot;Father&quot; which the dramatist uses in addressing his friend, suggests not only the disparity in their ages. It most importantly implies some suggestion of discipleship, with a more striking tribute by speaking of him as &quot;The ayde of his Muses&quot;.

==== Thomas Thorpe ====
Thomas Thorpe, in 1610, published a translation from &quot;Epictetus his Manuall.&quot; He dedicated this work to Florio, reminding him that he had procured a patron for an earlier work of John Healey&#x27;s &quot;His apprentises essay&quot;, and hoping that he would do the same by this one. In the three existing dedications by Thorpe, other than that to &quot;W. H&quot;., the first is addressed to Florio, the two others to the Earl of Pembroke, while the other, some years before, is addressed to the editor, Edward Blount.

We thus have Thorpe&#x27;s evidence that Florio procured him the Pembroke&#x27;s patronage. He also did the same for John Healey. Florio secured the patronage of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke for Healey&#x27;s &quot;The Discovery of a New World&quot;. This work was an extremely free and humour version of the &quot;Latin Mundus Alter ed Idem&quot;, a satire of England. Moreover, in 1609, John Florio gave to Thomas Thorpe his translation of Healey&#x27;s &quot;Discovery of a New World&quot;.

== Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; (1603) ==
Florio&#x27;s translation of Michel de Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; was licensed for publication to Edward Blount on 4 June 1600, and eventually published three years later, in 1603. Florio&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Essays&quot; came to be highly regarded as a literary art during the Elizabethan period. It was dedicated to six ladies of the court. The first book is for the Countess of Bedford and her mother. The second is divided between Lady Penelope Rich, Sidney&#x27;s Stella, and his daughter, Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland. He also adds an appropriate eulogy of the &#x27;perfect-unperfect&#x27; &quot;Arcadia.&quot; The third is given gracefully to two of Florio&#x27;s younger pupils. They are Lady Elizabeth Grey, daughter of the Earl of Shrewbury, and Lady Mary Nevill, daughter of England&#x27;s Lord High Treasurer.

In the letter addressed to the courteous reader, Florio champions translation as the most useful route for advancing knowledge and developing the language and culture of a nation. Again, here he connects this important issue with the recent army of opponents connected with the medievalism still firmly entrenched at the universities that were the most important sources of opposition. In his defence of translation, John Florio explained that there are many likely French words in his translation of Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; that, by being coupled with common words to explain them, may be &quot;familiar with our English, which well may beare them.&quot; He cites a number of such words he created, which he says some critics may object to: &quot;entraine, conscientious, endeare, tarnish, comporte, efface, facilitate, ammusing, debauching, regret, effort, emotion.&quot;

In the pages &quot;Of the Caniballes&quot; he borrows French words which were already in circulation but of late introduction and of restricted use. Some examples are &quot;febricitant, supplant, puissant.&quot; And at least one which appeared in an English text for the very first time: &quot;contexture&quot;. A key word for Montaigne which was used later by Bacon. Florio consciously experimented with English, grafting into it words and phrases from other languages. This led him to create not just new words, but also new grammatical constructions. For example, he was one of the first writers to use the genitive neuter pronoun &quot;its&quot;.

In his love of doubling, John Florio had taken the freedom of inventing compounds. &quot;L&#x27;ame plaine&quot; becomes &quot;a mind full-fraught&quot;, &quot;doux &amp; aggreable&quot; is &quot;a pleasing-sweet and gently-gliding speech&quot;. Words are combined in almost every fashion, and often with an extraordinarily fine effect. For example: &quot;marble-hearted&quot;. While the note of the sonnet cycles is caught in &quot;Pride-puft majestie&quot;, &quot;the fresh-bleeding memorie&quot;. Another great compound is &quot;with hight-swelling and heaven-disimbowelling words.&quot; Florio continually makes such alteration for the sake of a fuller picture. Such striving for action are always uppermost in his mind. Florio&#x27;s habit of seeing and saying things dramatically is one of his most distinctive qualities.

To read Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; in Florio&#x27;s translation is to read them, as it were, over the shoulders of some of England&#x27;s greatest writers.

== &quot;Queen Anna&#x27;s New World of Words&quot; (1611) ==
Florio&#x27;s magnum opus as lexicographer was his augmented dictionary, &quot;Queen Anna&#x27;s New World of Words, or Dictionarie of the Italian and English tongues&quot; (London 1611), embracing nearly 74,000 definitions. Not only was the volume almost twice larger than its predecessor, containing about 75,000 definitions, but in preparing it he had consulted 249 books, of which one-fifth appeared on the Index of prohibited books as against 72 listed in the &quot;World of Words&quot;, most belonging to the 17th century. These figures may be compared with the first edition of the Florentine &quot;Vocabolario della Crusca&quot;, published in 1612, which lists 230 works as sources for its material.

The sources consulted by John Florio are listed in the work and include books on all phrases of general and specialised knowledge. The definitions are so fully treated that for the most part the work is not only a dictionary but is also an encyclopedia of general knowledge of the time.

One of the most interesting features of the book-list is the high percentage of dramatic works which it contains. Vincenzo Spampanato has classified these as three tragedies (one of these, the &quot;Rosmunda&quot; of Rucellai, was one of the earliest modern regular tragedies) two tragi-comedies, Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Pastor Fido&quot;, and Celestina translated from the Spanish, five pastorals, among them being &quot;Aminta&quot;. The largest class are comedies, including Terence translated by Fabrini, Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Clizia&quot;, and many other comedies of the Intronati di Siena. In fact, approximately one-sixth of all the sources cited by Florio are now comedies, tragedies and pastorals by such authors as Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio, Matteo Bandello, Giovanni Boccaccio, Pietro Aretino, Machiavelli, Fiorentino, Ariosto, Sannazzaro, Tasso, and many old Italian Commedia dell&#x27;arte&#x27;s authors, for a total number of 39 plays.

In his search for words, Florio had also studied in Italian translations classical authors such as Tacitus, Cicero, Plato, Plutarch, Ovid, Pliny. Besides this wide reading in all subjects a close acquaintance with purely literary masterpieces is demanded of a lexicographer. The list shows that Dante had been studied with the aid of four commentators, Vellutello, Daniello, Boccaccio and Landino. Florio must have possessed a detailed knowledge of Dante, which was unusual at the period.

== Later years ==

=== Second marriage ===
In 1617, at the age of 65, Florio married Rose Spicer, his second wife. She nursed him through his last years and in his will he refers to her in terms of tender affection. The period as Groom of the Privy Chamber and Personal Secretary to the Queen were for Florio happy years. Anne had promised him a pension of £100 a year until death. But as King James&#x27; financial position worsened these Court pensions were never paid. Many loyal old courtiers were abandoned to poverty in the last years of his reign. Despite not being wealthy as he was before, Florio remained attached to all the things that once belonged to the Queen. Even after her death, he never sold them. Florio, in fact, still possessed her presents when he made his will, including her writing desk set with pearls and fitted with silver ink wells and sand box.

=== Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; ===
In 1620 Florio published the translation of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; anonymously. His translation omits the &quot;Proemio&quot; and &quot;Conclusione dell&#x27;autore&quot;, while replacing Tale III.x with an innocuous story taken from Francois de Belleforest&#x27;s &quot;Histoires tragiques&quot;, concluding that it &quot;was commended by all the company...because it was free from all folly and obscoeneness.&quot; Tale IX.x is also modified, while Tale V.x loses its homosexual innuendo.

=== Will and library ===
In 1623, two years before his death, at 70 years old, John Florio made his last will. He bequeathed his library to William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. He also gave him &quot;an unbound volume of divers written collections and rapsodies&quot;, asking him to place his books in his library &quot;eyther at Wilton or els at Baynards Castle at London.&quot; His books never reached Wilton House or Baynard&#x27;s Castle at London as requested. For unknown reasons, the executors named in the will renounced execution. Florio&#x27;s library has since disappeared. In his will John Florio mentioned &quot;about&quot; 340 books, most of them Italian, but also French, Spanish and English. Over the centuries some Florio scholars have attempted the impossible task of locating parts of his library. Arundel Del Re in his book about John Florio and &quot;First Fruits&quot; admitted he found only one book that belonged to Florio&#x27;s library. This is the &quot;Imprese&quot; by Paolo Giovio, and bears Florio&#x27;s signature: the book is now held in the British Library.

Frances Yates, Florio&#x27;s biographer, asserted that she once had seen an annotated copy of Chaucer that belonged to John Florio. In 2019, this copy was sold online by Peter Harrington. The cover contains John Florio&#x27;s handwriting: &quot;J. Florio: Ex dono John Dony.&quot; The copy is now in Yale University Library.

Michael Wyatt, in his study &quot;La biblioteca in volgare di John Florio&quot; (&quot;The Vernacular Library of John Florio&quot;) identified all the editions of the books used by Florio in compiling his dictionaries.

=== Death and resting place ===
John Florio died in Fulham, London, in about October 1625, a victim of the plague. Anthony Wood suggested that Florio&#x27;s sepulture was either in the church or in the graveyard of All Saints&#x27; Church, Fulham, but so far no stone marks of the resting place has been found and Frances Yates suggested a grimmer alternative: for those victims of the plague, Hurlingham Field was the site of a plague pit and Florio&#x27;s bones could &quot;lie in the bed of the lake at Hurlingham&quot;. Florio&#x27;s only surviving daughter, Aurelia, married James Molins, a surgeon. Aurelia Florio was a midwife and was one of England&#x27;s most celebrated midwives in the first part of the seventeenth century.

==Shakespeare authorship theory==
Florio, and his father, are two of the many individuals who have been proposed as the alternative author of the works of William Shakespeare by advocates of the Shakespeare authorship question. The Florios were probably first mentioned as authorship candidates in 1927.

According to Carla Rossi, the speculations about a Florio participation in Shakespeare&#x27;s writings are wholly without any foundation in the archives, though the object of intense speculation on the internet.

<text>Lord Beaumont currently properly refers only to the Duke of Norfolk as holder of the English Barony of Beaumont (created by writ in 1309). However, in a historical context, it can refer either to a past holder of that Barony or to a holder of one of the extinct Viscountcies of Beaumont:

* Viscount Beaumont (Peerage of England - created 1432, extinct 1507)
* Viscount Beaumont, of Swords in the County of Dublin (Peerage of Ireland - created 1622, extinct 1702)

<doc id="468838" wikidata="Q2499687" url="?curid=468838" title="Yatton">
<text>Yatton is a village and civil parish within the unitary authority of North Somerset, which falls within the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. It is located south-west of Bristol. Its population in 2011 was 7,552. The parish includes Claverham, a small village which was originally a farming hamlet.

The origins of the village and its name are unclear; however, there is evidence of Iron Age hill fort and a Roman villa in the area. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century and more recent road building have led to expansion of the village with Yatton now acting as a home to many commuters, while also supporting manufacturing industry and commerce. The village is located on the North Somerset Levels, where the low-lying land, a mixture of peat, estuarine alluvium and low hills of sand and gravel, is crossed by a myriad of watercourses, providing a habitat for several scarce species.

St Mary&#x27;s Church dates from the 14th century and there are a range of other places of worship. In addition to religious groups, Yatton has several sporting clubs and other community groups.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
The origin of the name Yatton is uncertain. It may come from the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;gatton&#x27; meaning &#x27;village on the track&#x27;; the track in question is a path of limestone leading from Cadbury Hill. The village has at one time or another been called Jatune, Eaton (from ea [river] and tun i.e. the settlement on the River Yeo and Yatton Blewitt), and is recorded as Lature in the Domesday Book. West Yatton was also known as Yatton-Kaynes in the Elizabethan era.

=== Pre-history ===
Situated on an area of slightly higher, drained ground surrounded by moorland (locally called a &#x27;batch&#x27;), Yatton was a well-established village by Norman times. The remains of an Iron Age hill fort at Cadbury Hill have been discovered, as well as a Roman villa, temple and hoard of coins. Older Christian burial grounds have also been discovered on Cadbury Hill.

The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred.

=== Railway ===
In the 1840s, the Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel as consulting engineer, was opened. It was initially leased to the Great Western Railway (GWR) but taken back into full ownership in 1849 and gained its own individuality which lasted until 1876 when all the broad gauge companies in the West Country merged into an enlarged GWR. The station was originally called Clevedon Road and renamed Yatton Junction when the Clevedon branch was built in 1847. Other branches followed, to Cheddar/Wells (1869) and the Wrington Vale Light Railway (1901) to Blagdon from Congresbury.
 Although the branch line to Blagdon was closed to passengers in 1932, and the Clevedon and Cheddar/Wells lines were closed during the 1960s, the classically Victorian station designed by Brunel is still in use. From 2001 to 2006 the station was operated by Wessex Trains when, in an echo of 1876, it was again absorbed into the new Greater Western Trains Co. It is now possible to walk or cycle along the former route of the Strawberry Line (so called because of the trade in Cheddar&#x27;s strawberries) from Yatton to Cheddar. A local group successfully raised funding to establish a community cafe in the old waiting room building at the station, and the cafe opened for business in December 2010. Prior to local authority cutbacks, Bakers Dolphin maintained a replacement bus connection (route 66) between Yatton and Clevedon. There is currently no public transport connection to Clevedon.

=== 20th century ===

In 1922 the site formerly known as &#x27;The Pound&#x27; was purchased and the Yatton Parish War Memorial was erected. The memorial is located at Top Scaur, at the Congresbury end of the High Street, and is inscribed with the names of Yatton villagers who died in the First and Second World Wars. Each year on Remembrance Sunday a march is held from St Mary&#x27;s Church to the memorial, where wreaths are laid by villagers and local organisations.

The village has continued to increase in size with several new developments planned or currently being constructed north of the railway station near North End Road and Arnold&#x27;s Way. Development to the south and east of the village has made the villages of Yatton, Claverham and Cleeve almost continuous as far as the A370. Cadbury House Country Club is being developed to become a 60-room hotel and leisure centre.

The hamlet of North End lies to the north of the North End roundabout, just before the junction for Kingston Seymour, and contains around 30 properties, including a number of farms and the &quot;Bridge Inn&quot; hotel.

== Governance ==
The parish council, which has 18 members, has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

North Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.

An electoral ward exists with the same name. The ward stretches to the Bristol Channel and therefore includes Kingston Seymour in addition to &quot;Yatton&quot;. The total ward population taken from the 2011 census was 9,273.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

== Geography ==
The area around Yatton and Claverham, which falls within the North Somerset Levels, is a mixture of peat, estuarine alluvium and low hills of sand and gravel with, to the south the limestone ridge of Cadbury Hill, which rises to . On its summit stands an Iron Age hill fort known, in archaeological circles, as Cadbury-Congresbury in order to differentiate it from the Cadbury hillfort in South Cadbury. It appears to have been constructed in the Iron Age when one or more ramparts, with walls and ditches, were built on the steep slopes of the hill to defend an area covering some .

Biddle Street has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest where management practices and the variation in the soils has resulted in the watercourses supporting a wide range of aquatic plant communities. Where open water occurs plants such as common water-starwort &quot;(Callitriche stagnalis)&quot;, European frogbit &quot;(Hydrocharis morsusranae)&quot;, fan-leaved water-crowfoot &quot;(Ranunculus circinatus)&quot;. The calcareous influence of the underlying Compton soils also encourages whorled water-milfoil &quot;(Myriophyllum verticillatum)&quot; and stonewort &quot;(Chara sp)&quot;. Also present are the nationally scarce rootless duckweed &quot;(Wolffia arrhiza)&quot; and hairlike pondweed &quot;(Potamogeton trichoides)&quot;.

Along with the rest of South West England, Yatton has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.

== Demography ==
After the Second World War the size and population of Yatton expanded dramatically. With a railway providing good access to Weston-super-Mare, Bristol and London, and similarly good access by road, the village saw large amounts of new housing development. Today the number of pre-war buildings is much smaller than the number of more recent residential and commercial constructions. According to the 2001 census, Yatton&#x27;s population was 9,176.

== Economy ==

Today Yatton is a large village. Page&#x27;s Court — the village&#x27;s shopping precinct —  includes a supermarket and several local shops and takeaways.

There are a number of thriving local businesses, including Pullin&#x27;s Bakers, Costain Technology Solutions (formerly Simulation Systems Ltd), Stowell Concrete, Smart Systems, Oxford Instruments, and Bob Martin Petcare. Farming remains an important activity in the area.

Fairey Hydraulics was sited in Claverham, becoming Claverham Ltd in 1998. The site closed in 2017, and is today a housing estate.

== Education ==
The local education authority is North Somerset Council. Yatton has a pre-school, infant and junior schools.

Secondary education is not available in the village, and so many of Yatton&#x27;s children commute daily to the nearby village of Backwell in order to attend Backwell School. The school is a specialist Arts College, and includes a sixth form and takes pupils from the age of 11 (Year 7) to the age of 18 (Year 13). In November 2008, Backwell School was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.

== Religious sites ==

St Mary&#x27;s Church, in central Yatton, built around 1400, is often called the &quot;Cathedral of the Moors&quot; since it is so large compared to the village. The tower has three stages with diagonal weathered buttresses with crocketed pinnacles. There is a south-east hexagonal stair turret rising above the parapet with panelled sides to the top, and an open cusped parapet. There are stained glass windows with the coats of arms of local lords of the manor. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The Old Rectory was a Prebendary house, built in the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building.

As well as St Mary&#x27;s (Church of England), Yatton has Methodist, Catholic and independent places of worship. Yatton Methodist Church is situated on the High Street, opposite the main shopping precinct. Horsecastle Chapel, an independent evangelical church, is on Horsecastle Farm Road. River of Life Church, (was YCF) affiliated to the Assemblies of God, meets in Yatton Infant School. St Dunstan&#x27;s, a Roman Catholic chapel of ease to the parish in Clevedon, is on Claverham Road.

The church of St. Barnabas in Claverham, dates from 1879 and is a grade II listed building. Along with churches in Kenn, Cleeve and Kingston Seymour the churches are managed as part of the Yatton Moor Team Ministry.

== Sports ==
There are active cricket, football and rugby clubs, two parks (Hangstones and Rock Road), a number of public houses, and many other leisure and sporting activities, including the Cleeve Claverham and Yatton Scout Group.

Yatton Rugby Club was founded in 1968 and as of the end of the 2015/16 season, were promoted to the Western Counties North division, having won the Tribute Somerset Premier League for 2015/16. They run three senior sides and have an extensive junior set-up.

Claverham (Yatton) Cricket Club was formed in 1905 and provides cricket to all playing levels and ages. The senior teams play in the ECB West of England Premier League.

== Public services ==

Yatton fire station opened in 1947, after the Fire Services Act 1947, when fire service responsibility transferred from national government to local authority control after World War II. The current station was built in 1973. Today, Yatton fire station, which is part of Avon Fire and Rescue Service, runs with two appliances, a water tender ladder and a specialist hose-laying vehicle.

The Yatton firefighters work on a retained duty system, which means that they do not work at the fire station, but are called to the station when a fire breaks out. They respond to emergencies in a area covering Yatton, Cleeve, Kingston Seymour, Congresbury, Wrington and Blagdon, with an average of 130–150 callouts per year. Calls vary from small grass fires to full major alerts and road traffic accidents on the busy A370 main road. The Avon Fire and Rescue Service named Yatton Fire Station was named &quot;highest performing retained duty station&quot; for 2010.

== Notable people ==
George Lukins, also known as the Yatton daemoniac, was an individual famous for his alleged demonic possession and the subsequent exorcism that occurred in 1788. Ken Day was born in Yatton in 1919 and played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club in seven matches between 1950 and 1956. Major Richard Foord, Liberal Democrat MP for Tiverton and Honiton, lived in Yatton for nineteen years.

<text>Hartmut Haenchen (born 21 March 1943) is a German conductor, known as a specialist for the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and for conducting operas in the leading opera houses of the world.

== Career ==

Born in Dresden, Haenchen began his musical career as a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor. By the age of 15, he was already conducting performances as cantor. As a 17-year-old, he attracted widespread attention with his revival of Johann Adolph Hasse&#x27;s Requiem. Haenchen subsequently studied conducting and voice at the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber. He then attended master classes in Berlin, Leningrad and at Carinthian Summer Festival in Austria, later attending rehearsals at the Bayreuth Festival and concerts conducted by Herbert von Karajan.

Haenchen&#x27;s first engagement was as director of the Robert-Franz-Singakademie (choral society) in Halle and conductor of the Halle Philharmonic Orchestra in 1966. He went on to win first prize at the Carl Maria von Weber Competition in Dresden in 1971. In 1972–1973 Haenchen served as principal Kapellmeister of the Zwickau Theatre. During that period he made his debut at the Berlin State Opera, directing Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. He appeared there regularly until 1986.

From 1973 to 1976, Haenchen was conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic and a regular guest with the Semperoper. Between 1976 and 1979, he served as music director of the Mecklenburgische Staatskapelle and Staatstheater in Schwerin. Subsequently, he began to make regular appearances at Komische Oper Berlin. From 1980 to 2014 he was artistic director of the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Chamber Orchestra in Berlin.

In 1986, Haenchen became music director of the De Nederlandse Opera (DNO) in Amsterdam and chief conductor of the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO) and the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra. During his tenure in Amsterdam, DNO became renowned for its high-quality ensemble productions and innovative stagings. Haenchen was particularly associated with the German repertoire: Richard Strauss, Mozart, and Wagner, but he also conducted opera of Verdi, Bartók, Tchaikovsky, Puccini, and Gluck. After the 1999 &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, Haenchen left his post but has continued as a guest conductor. With the NPO, the newly formed Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra quickly rose in stature, under his leadership, not only in its opera performances but also in symphonic concerts, recordings, and foreign tours. Haenchen resigned his position in September 2002 to protest budget cuts. However, he frequently returned to the NPO and was appointed as their honorary conductor in March 2023.

Haenchen has made guest appearances in virtually all the European countries and toured Japan, the United States and Canada. He has conducted operas in Amsterdam, Berlin, Bologna, Dresden, Geneva, Jerusalem, London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, New York City, Paris, Stuttgart, Warsaw, Vienna and the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden.

He was scheduled to conduct &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival in the summer of 2016 and 2017.

<doc id="468842" wikidata="Q456590" url="?curid=468842" title="Gervase Markham">
<text>Gervase (or Jervis) Markham (ca. 1568 – 3 February 1637) was an English poet and writer. He was best known for his work &quot;The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman&quot;, first published in London in 1615.

==Life==
Markham was the third son of Sir Robert Markham of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, and was probably born in 1568. He was a soldier of fortune in the Low Countries, and later was a captain under the Earl of Essex&#x27;s command in Ireland. He was acquainted with Latin and several modern languages, and had an exhaustive practical acquaintance with the arts of forestry and agriculture. He was a noted horse-breeder, and is said to have imported the first Arabian horse to England.

Very little is known of the events of his life. The story of the murderous quarrel between Gervase Markham and Sir John Holles related in the &quot;Biographia&quot; (s.v. Holles) has been generally connected with him, but in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Sir Clements R. Markham, a descendant from the same family, refers it to another contemporary of the same name, whose monument is still to be seen in Laneham church. Gervase Markham was buried at St Giles&#x27;s, Cripplegate, London, on 3 February 1637.

==Works==

Markham was a voluminous writer on many subjects, but repeated himself, and sometimes reprinted books under other titles. His booksellers procured from him a declaration in 1617 that he would produce no more on certain topics.

Markham&#x27;s writings include:
* 1593: &quot;A Discourse of Horsemanship&quot;, followed by other popular treatises on horsemanship and farriery;
* 1595: &quot;The most Honorable Tragedy of Sir Richard Grinvile&quot; (1595), reprinted (1871) by Professor E. Arber, a prolix and euphuistic poem in eight-lined stanzas on Sir Richard Grenville;
* 1595: &quot;The Poem of Poems, or Syon&#x27;s Muse&quot;, dedicated to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Sidney;
* 1597: &quot;Devoreux, Virtue&#x27;s Tears&quot;;
* 1600: &quot;The Teares of the Beloved&quot; and &quot;Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Tears&quot; (1601), long and rather commonplace poems on the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, both reprinted by Dr. A. B. Grosart in the &quot;Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library&quot; (1871);
* 1602: A translation of the satires of Lodovico Ariosto;
* 1607: &quot;Cavelarice, or The English Horseman&quot;, featuring secrets of William Bankes, master of the performing horse Marocco;
* 1607: &quot;The English Arcadia&quot;, part 1. A sequel to Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;. Part 2 appeared in 1613;

<text>The [[moment of inertia]], denoted by , measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis; it is the rotational analogue to mass (which determines an object&#x27;s resistance to &quot;linear&quot; acceleration). The moments of inertia of a mass have units of dimension ML2 ([mass] × [length]2). It should not be confused with the second moment of area, which has units of dimension L4 ([length]4) and is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia or sometimes as the angular mass.

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact closed-form expression. Typically this occurs when the mass density is constant, but in some cases, the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. In calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the parallel axis and the perpendicular axis theorems.

This article considers mainly symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the center of mass unless otherwise specified.

==Moments of inertia==
Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor: see below.

== List of 3D inertia tensors ==

This list of moment of inertia tensors is given for principal axes of each object.

To obtain the scalar moments of inertia I above, the tensor moment of inertia I is projected along some axis defined by a unit vector n according to the formula:

<doc id="468847" wikidata="Q5577745" url="?curid=468847" title="Going-to future">
<text>The &quot;going-to&quot; future is a grammatical construction used in English to refer to various types of future occurrences. It is made using appropriate forms of the expression &quot;to be going to&quot;. It is an alternative to other ways of referring to the future in English, such as the future construction formed with &quot;will&quot; (or &quot;shall&quot;) – in some contexts the different constructions are interchangeable, while in others they carry somewhat different implications.

Constructions analogous to the English &quot;going-to&quot; future are found in some other languages, including French, Spanish and some varieties of Arabic.

==Origin==
The &quot;going-to&quot; future originated in the late 15th century by the extension of the spatial sense of the verb &quot;go&quot; to a temporal sense (a common change, the same phenomenon can be seen in the preposition &quot;before&quot;). The original construction involved physical movement with an intention, such as &quot;I am going [outside] to harvest the crop.&quot; The location later became unnecessary, and the expression was reinterpreted to represent a near future.

==Contracted forms==

The &quot;going to&quot; future construction is frequently contracted in colloquial English, with the colloquial form gonna and the other variations of it resulting from a relaxed pronunciation. In some forms of English, the copula may also be omitted. Hence &quot;You&#x27;re going to be&quot; could be said as &quot;You&#x27;re gonna be&quot; or just &quot;You gonna be&quot;. In the grammatical first person, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna&quot; (which is, in full, &quot;I am going to&quot;) may further contract to &quot;I&#x27;m&#x27;n&#x27;a&quot; or &quot;&quot; .

These contracted forms can provide a distinction between the spatial and temporal senses of the expression: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna swim&quot; explicitly carries the temporal meaning of futurity, as opposed to the spatial meaning of &quot;I&#x27;m going [now] [in order] to swim&quot;, or &quot;I&#x27;m going [in the pool] to swim&quot;.

==Formation==
The &quot;going-to&quot; idiom, used to express futurity is a semi-modal verb that consists of a form of the copula verb &quot;be&quot;, the word &quot;going&quot; followed by the word &quot;to&quot;, for instance &quot;is going to&quot;. Like other modals, it is followed by the base infinitive of the main verb (compare with &quot;ought to&quot;.) (An alternative description is that it uses the verb &quot;go&quot; in the progressive aspect, most commonly in present progressive form, serving as an auxiliary verb and having the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive phrase as its complement. However this description fails to take into account sentences in which the main verb is elided, such as &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s going to.&quot;) It can be put into question and negative forms according to the normal rules of English grammar.

Some examples:
*The boys are going to fight. (subject &quot;the boys&quot; + copula &quot;are&quot; + &quot;going to&quot; + base-infinitive &quot;fight&quot;)
*I&#x27;m going to try the wine. (subject &quot;I&quot; + copula &quot;am&quot; + &quot;going to&quot; + base-infinitive phrase &quot;try the wine&quot;)
*He&#x27;s not going to make it. (negative form, copula negated with the addition of &quot;not&quot;)
*Are you going to bring Sue? (interrogative form, featuring subject–auxiliary inversion)
*Aren&#x27;t they (&quot;more formal:&quot; Are they not) going to wear coats? (negative interrogative form)
*We were going to tell you earlier. (past form of the &quot;going-to&quot; future, formed with the past copula &quot;were&quot;)
*Yes, I&#x27;m going to. (main verb is elided).

That the verb &quot;go&quot; as used in this construction is distinct from the ordinary lexical verb &quot;go&quot; can be seen in the fact that the two can be used together: &quot;I&#x27;m going to go to the store now.&quot; Also the lexical use of &quot;going to&quot; is not subject to the contractions to &quot;gonna&quot; and similar: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna get his autograph&quot; clearly implies the future meaning (intention), and not the meaning &quot;I&#x27;m going [somewhere] [in order] to get his autograph.&quot;

==Usage==
The &quot;going-to&quot; future is one of several constructions used in English to refer to future events (see ). The basic form of the &quot;going-to&quot; construction is in fact in the present tense; it is often used when the speaker wishes to draw a connection between present events, situations, or intentions and expected future events or situations, i.e. to express the present relevance of the future occurrence. It may therefore be described as expressing prospective aspect, in the same way that the present perfect (which refers to the present relevance of &quot;past&quot; occurrences) is said to express retrospective (or perfect) aspect.

There is no clear delineation between contexts where &quot;going to&quot; is used and those where other forms of future expression (such as the &quot;will/shall&quot; future, or the ordinary present tense) are used. Different forms are often interchangeable. Some general points of usage are listed below. 
*The &quot;going-to&quot; future is relatively informal; in more formal contexts it may be replaced by the &quot;will/shall&quot; future, or by expressions such as &quot;plan(s) to&quot;, &quot;expect(s) to&quot;, &quot;is/are expected to&quot;, etc.
*The ordinary present tense can be used to refer to the future when the context (or time adverbs) indicate futurity, and the reference is to some planned action: &quot;We are painting the house tomorrow&quot; (this could also be expressed with &quot;... going to paint ...&quot;). It is usually the present progressive that is used, as in the preceding example, but the simple present can also be used, particularly for precisely scheduled events: &quot;My train leaves at 4.15.&quot; (See also the obligatory use of present tense with future meaning in some dependent clauses.)
*When the expression of futurity is combined with that of some modality, such as obligation or possibility, a modal verb (not marked specifically for the future) may be used: &quot;We must/can do it tomorrow.&quot; There is also the expression &quot;am to&quot; etc., which implies obligation or expectation as in &quot;He is to deliver it this afternoon&quot; (see the following section), and the expression &quot;to be about to&quot; (also &quot;to be due to&quot; and similar), implying immediacy (&quot;I am about to leave&quot;).
*The &quot;going-to&quot; form sometimes indicates imminence, but sometimes does not; and it sometimes indicates intention, but sometimes does not (compare &quot;It&#x27;s going to rain&quot;, which expresses imminence but not intention, and &quot;I&#x27;m going to visit Paris someday&quot;, which expresses intention but not imminence).
*The &quot;will&quot; future is often used for announcing a decision at the time when it is made, while &quot;going to&quot; is more likely for a plan already in existence: compare &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll help her&quot; and &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m going to help her&quot;.
*The &quot;will&quot; future is used more often than &quot;going to&quot; in conditional sentences of the &quot;first conditional&quot; type: &quot;If it rains, you″ll get wet&quot; (although &quot;going to&quot; is also sometimes found in such sentences).
*In some contexts the &quot;going-to&quot; form can express unconditionality while the &quot;will&quot; form expresses conditionality (&quot;Don&#x27;t sit on that rock, it&#x27;s going to fall&quot; means it&#x27;s going to fall regardless of what you do, while &quot;Don&#x27;t sit on that rock, it will fall&quot; means that it will fall conditional on your sitting on it). But in some contexts (particularly with &quot;future in the past&quot; – see the following section) the reverse can be true (&quot;After 1962 ended, I would be a star&quot; unconditionally describes what subsequently did happen, while &quot;After 1962 ended, I was going to be a star&quot; describes only intention).

===The &quot;be + to&quot; construction===
English has a construction formed by a form of the copula &quot;be&quot; followed by &quot;to&quot; and the bare infinitive of the main verb (i.e. the copula followed by the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive). This is similar in form to the &quot;going-to&quot; future, with the omission of the word &quot;going&quot;. In the &quot;be + to&quot; construction only finite, indicative (or past subjunctive) forms of the copula can appear – that is, the copula used cannot be &quot;be&quot; itself, but one of the forms &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot; (possibly contracted in some cases).

The meaning of this construction is to indicate that something is expected to happen at a future time (usually in the near future), as a result of either some duty (deontic modality) or some set plan. For example:
* I″m to report to the principal this afternoon. (duty)
* The Prime Minister is to visit the West Bank. (plan)
* Troops are to be sent to war-torn Darfur. (plan; note passive voice)

In headline language the copula may be omitted, e.g. &quot;Prime Minister to visit West Bank&quot;.

Compared with the &quot;will&quot; future, the &quot;be + to&quot; construction may be less expressive of a prediction, and more of the existence of a plan or duty. Thus &quot;John will go ...&quot; implies a belief on the speaker&#x27;s part that this will occur, while &quot;John is to go ...&quot; implies knowledge on the speaker&#x27;s part that there exists a plan or obligation entailing such an occurrence (the latter statement will not be falsified if John ends up not going). The &quot;be + to&quot; construction may therefore resemble a renarrative mood in some ways.

When &quot;was&quot; or &quot;were&quot; is used as the copula, the plan or duty is placed in past time (and quite often implies that it was not carried out). It may also be used simply as a way of expressing &quot;future in the past&quot; (see the following section). For example:
::I was to visit my aunt, but I missed the train. (past plan, not in fact fulfilled)
::This was the battle at which they were finally to triumph. (future in the past, also: &quot;they would finally triumph&quot;)

The construction also appears in condition clauses:
::If you are to go on holiday, you need to work hard. (i.e. working hard is necessary for going on holiday)
::If he was/were to speak, it would change things significantly. (also &quot;if he spoke&quot;)
When the verb in such a clause is &quot;were&quot;, it can be inverted and the conjunction &quot;if&quot; dropped: &quot;Were he to speak, ...&quot; For details of these constructions, see English conditional sentences.

==Expressions using &quot;going to&quot; as relative future form==
The &quot;going-to&quot; construction, as well as other constructions used in English refer to future events, can be used not only to express the future relative to the present time, but also sometimes to express the future relative to some other time of reference (see relative tense).

Some reference points appear more suitable for use in relative future than others. The following are universally attested:
*Future relative to a past reference point is formed using the past tense of the copula, e.g. &quot;I &quot;was&quot; going to eat dinner&quot; (instead of the present &quot;I &quot;am&quot; going to eat dinner&quot;). This may express past intention (&quot;I was going to eat dinner&quot;) or prediction (&quot;It was going to rain&quot;).
*Ongoing intention or prediction existing up to the present time is also attested, based on the present perfect progressive of the copula. For example, &quot;I have been going to do it for some time&quot; (but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it) or &quot;It has been going to rain all afternoon&quot; (but it hasn&#x27;t started). Similar sentences can be formed on the past perfect progressive (e.g. &quot;I had been going to eat&quot;).
*Future relative to a past subjunctive is attested in a condition clause: &quot;If I was/were going to eat...&quot;

The following relative futures are more nebulous:
*Future event relative to a future reference point. In theory, one could string two going-to futures together (&quot;I&#x27;m going to be going to eat&quot;), or, to more easily disambiguate them, use the modular future for the reference point (&quot;I will be going to eat&quot;). A strong example might be one that incorporates the precise difference in time between the reference point and the event: &quot;We can&#x27;t visit Louise in June, because she&#x27;ll be going to have a baby three weeks from then.&quot;
**However, it is not clear that English speakers would agree on the naturalness of this construction or on the interpretation. In fact, some have argued that such a construction does not occur in English or other natural languages with the intended meaning; the latter &quot;going to&quot; in these constructions may signify the main verb to go as in &quot;to move from one place to another.&quot;
**Others have speculated about this grammatical lacuna. Hans Reichenbach&#x27;s scheme of tenses identifies a sequence S-R-E, i.e. speech act followed by reference point followed by event, but it does not correspond to an English tense in a strict sense. Latin had a form that may have corresponded to this use, e.g. in the phrase &quot;abiturus ero&quot;, which could be translated &quot;I shall be one of those who will leave.&quot; Other authors have argued that the future of the future is &quot;not attested in natural languages.&quot; The South Indian language Kannada has a posterior future tense that might correspond to this usage, but reportedly denotes &quot;to need to.&quot;
**Some have speculated that the lacuna, if it exists, may have a semantic origin; that is, the future is already difficult to specify, and there is simply little occasion in human experience for using a future event as a reference point for a &quot;further&quot; future event.
*Future relative to a hypothetical (conditional) state: &quot;I would be going to eat.&quot; A similar interpretation to future relative to future may arise instead: &quot;I would be going (on my way) to eat.&quot;
*Future relative to unspecified time: the infinitive (or occasionally present subjunctive) of the copula can be used, e.g. &quot;To be going to die is not a good feeling.&quot; The infinitive can be used in a variety of constructions, in line with the normal uses of the English infinitive; for example, &quot;He is said to be going to resign.&quot; Speakers may differ on the interpretation of such constructions.

Relative future is also possible for a limited number of uses of the modular &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; in their so-called past tense forms, respectively &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; (see future in the past).

Periphrastic phrases may be able to express some relative future meanings that are otherwise unattested. For example, the phrase &quot;to be about to&quot; means that in the very near future, one will do something. Hence, &quot;I will be about to leave&quot; expresses a future event relative to a future reference point.

Another construction, &quot;to be to&quot;, also has similar denotations in some constructions, e.g. &quot;I was to see the Queen the next day.&quot; However, its use is restricted to simple finite forms of the copula, namely the present indicative (&quot;I am to do it&quot;), the past indicative (&quot;I was to do it&quot;), and the past subjunctive (&quot;if I were to do it&quot; or &quot;were I to do it&quot;; these last have somewhat different implications, as described at English conditional sentences).

==Related forms in creoles==
Some creole languages have a marker of future time reference (or irrealis mood) modeled on the verb &quot;go&quot; as found in the &quot;going-to&quot; future of the English superstrate.

Examples include Jamaican English Creole /de go hapm/ &quot;is going to happen&quot;, /mi a go ɹon/ &quot;I am going to run&quot;, Belizean Creole English /gwein/ or /gouɲ/, Gullah &quot;Uh gwine he&#x27;p dem&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to help them&quot;, Hawaiian Creole English /Ai gon bai wan pickup/ &quot;I gonna buy one pickup&quot;, /Da gai sed hi gon fiks mi ap wit wan blain deit/ &quot;The guy said he gonna fix me up with one blind date&quot;, and Haitian Creole /Mwen va fini/ &quot;I go finish&quot;.

==Analogous forms in other languages==
Similarly to English, the French verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;) can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-future tense (&quot;le futur proche&quot;). For example, the English sentence &quot;I am going to do it tomorrow&quot; can be translated by &quot;Je vais le faire demain&quot; (literally &quot;I go it to do tomorrow&quot;; French does not have a distinct present progressive form, so &quot;je vais&quot; stands for both &quot;I go&quot; and &quot;I am going&quot;). As in English, the French form can generally be replaced by the present or future tense: &quot;Je le fais demain&quot; (&quot;I am doing it tomorrow&quot;) or &quot;Je le ferai demain&quot; (&quot;I will do it tomorrow&quot;).

Likewise, the Spanish verb &quot;ir&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;) can be used to express the future: &quot;Mi padre va a llegar mañana&quot; (&quot;My father is going to arrive tomorrow&quot;). Here the preposition &quot;a&quot; is used, analogous to the English &quot;to&quot;; the French construction does not have this.

In Welsh, a Brittonic and Celtic language, the verb &quot;mynd&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;) is used much like the English verb &quot;go&quot;. In the sentence &quot;dw i&#x27;n mynd i wneud e yfory&quot; (&quot;I am going to do it tomorrow&quot;) &quot;mynd&quot; is followed by the preposition &quot;i&quot; (&quot;to, for&quot;) which is itself followed by the verb &quot;gwneud&quot; (&quot;to do&quot;) in mutated form (hence the missing initial &#x27;g&#x27;). This forms a &quot;going-to future&quot; as found in English.

The form is well established in urban varieties of Irish, using &quot;Tá&quot; (the Irish verb &#x27;to be&#x27;), the preposition &#x27;chun&#x27; (&quot;to&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;) and the verbal noun moved by transformation to the end of the verbal phrase. So &quot;tá mé chun an bus a thógáil&quot; - (&quot;I am going to take the bus&quot;). It is much less used in rural dialects, where the plain future tense is still preferred.

<doc id="468852" wikidata="Q123085" url="?curid=468852" title="Juliana Berners">
<text>Juliana Berners, [[Order of St Benedict|O.S.B.]], (or Barnes or Bernes) (born 1388), was an English writer on heraldry, hawking and hunting, and is said to have been prioress of the St Mary of Sopwell, near St Albans in Hertfordshire.

==Life and work==
Very little is known about Juliana Berners, and that which is known cannot be verified with certainty. She was the author of treatises on field sports, such as hunting, and many people credit her with the entirety of &quot;The Boke of Saint Albans.&quot; A facsimile of &quot;The Boke of Saint Albans&quot;, published in 1810 by Joseph Haslewood, contains an introduction which examines the authorship of the book and the biography of Juliana Berners. Unfortunately, this introduction is largely speculative.

Based on her last name, scholars suggest that she was either the daughter of the courtier Sir James Berners or wife to the lord of the manor of Julians Barnes. Whatever family she came from, it is likely that she was high-born and well-educated. It is generally believed that she entered the monastic life and became the prioress of Sopwell Nunnery near St Albans. How and when she joined the nunnery is unknown.

Since she was most likely brought up at court, she no doubt hunted and fished with other fashionable court ladies. After she adopted the monastic life, she probably retained her love of hawking, hunting and fishing, and her passion for field sports, which led her to write her treatise on hunting and perhaps others. These treatises are remarkable in the fact that they are some of the earliest extant writings of their kind, as well as in their vision and insight. They include remarks on the virtues of environmental conservation and on etiquette for field sports, concepts which would not become commonly accepted for hundreds of years after the publication of these treatises.

Though so little is known about her life, and her claim to the authorship of &quot;The Boke of Saint Albans&quot; cannot be absolutely verified, numerous women&#x27;s fly-fishing clubs in Europe and the United States are named for Berners. She is remembered as one of the first authors (of either sex) to write on angling.

==Works==
===&quot;The Boke of St. Albans&quot;===
The first and rarest edition of &quot;The Boke of Saint Albans&quot; was printed in 1486 by an unknown schoolmaster at St Albans. It has no title-page. The only clue to the authorship of the Treatise, and the only documentary evidence of her, is an attribution at the end of the original 1486 book that reads: &quot;Explicit Dam Julyans Barnes in her boke of huntyng.&quot; Her name was changed by Wynkyn de Worde to &quot;Dame Julyans Bernes.&quot; There is no such person to be found in the pedigree of the Berners family, but there is a gap in the records of the priory of Sopwell between 1430 and 1480. De Worde&#x27;s edition (fol. 1496), also without a title page, begins:
This edition was adorned by three woodcuts, and included a &quot;Treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle&quot;, not contained in the St Albans edition.

When Joseph Haslewood published a facsimile of Wynkyn de Worde&#x27;s edition with a biographical and bibliographical notice, examined with the greatest care the author&#x27;s claims to figure as the earliest woman author in the English language. He assigned to her little else in the &quot;Boke&quot; except part of the treatise on hawking and the section on hunting. It is stated at the end of the &quot;Blasynge of Armys&quot; that the section was &quot;translatyd and compylyt&quot;, and it is likely that the other treatises are translations, probably from the French.

Only three perfect copies of the first edition are known to exist. A facsimile, entitled &quot;The Boke of St Albans&quot;, with an introduction by William Blades, appeared in 1881. During the 16th century the work was very popular, and was many times reprinted. It was edited by Gervase Markham in 1595 as &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Academie&quot;.

===&quot;Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle&quot;===
The &quot;Treatise on Fishing&quot;, which was added to the 1496 edition printed by Wynkyn de Worde, is the earliest known English language work on fly fishing. More than 150 years later it was an influence on Izaak Walton, another English writer, when he wrote &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;.

An older form of the treatise on fishing was edited in 1883 by T. Satchell from a manuscript in possession of Alfred Denison. This treatise probably dates from about 1450, and formed the foundation of that section in the book of 1496.

<text>William Blades (5 December 182427 April 1890), English printer and bibliographer, was born at Clapham, London.

== Career ==

In 1840 he was apprenticed to his father&#x27;s printing business in London, being subsequently taken into partnership. The firm was afterwards known as Blades, East &amp; Blades. His interest in printing led him to make a study of the volumes produced by William Caxton&#x27;s press, and of the early history of printing in England.

His &quot;Life and Typography of William Caxton, England&#x27;s First Printer&quot;, was published in 1861–1863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton&#x27;s hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order.

In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals. His publications relate chiefly to the early history of printing. The &quot;Enemies of Books&quot; was his most popular work, being produced in 1880. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1882.

On his death, his library was acquired by the St Bride Foundation as the initial collection of the library. The architect of the St Bride Foundation building, Robert Cunningham Murray, created a room to house the collection that was a near replica of Blade&#x27;s original library.

== Death ==

He died at Sutton in Surrey on 27 April 1890.

<text>Henry Willobie (or Willoughby) (1575? – 1596?) is the ostensible author of a 1594 verse novella called &quot;Willobie His Avisa&quot; (in modern spelling, &quot;Willoughby&#x27;s Avisa&quot;), a work that is of interest primarily because of its possible connection with William Shakespeare&#x27;s life and writings.

== Life and work ==
Henry Willobie was the second son of a Wiltshire gentleman of the same name. He matriculated from St John&#x27;s College, Oxford in December 1591 at the age of sixteen, and is probably the same Henry Willobie who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Exeter College, Oxford early in 1595. He published &quot;Willobie his Avisa&quot; in 1594.

Willobie may have died before 30 June 1596, when a new edition of &quot;Willobie his Avisa&quot; was published with the addition of an &quot;Apologie&quot; by Hadrian Dorrell, a friend of the author, which describes him as &quot;now of late gone to God.&quot; Dorrell alleges that he found the manuscript of &quot;Willobie his Avisa&quot; among his friend&#x27;s papers, which were left in his charge when Willobie departed from Oxford on Her Majesty&#x27;s service. There is no trace of any Hadrian Dorrell in the historical record, and the name may be a pseudonym, perhaps even for Willobie himself.

Several authors have suggested that Willobie was not the real author of the poem. Arthur Acheson suggested that Matthew Roydon may have been the author, arguing that the poem obliquely described Shakespeare&#x27;s relationship to Jane Davenant, the mother of William Davenant, who later hinted that he was Shakespeare&#x27;s son. Roydon&#x27;s authorship was later tentatively endorsed by G. B. Harrison, and reasserted by Christopher Hill. M. C. Bradbrook argued that it was a collaborative work written by Walter Raleigh&#x27;s circle, the so-called School of Night, with which Roydon was associated.

&quot;Willobie his Avisa&quot; was extremely popular, and passed through numerous editions. In 1596 a writer called Peter Colse produced a replicate named &quot;Penelope&#x27;s Complaint&quot;.

== Connection with Shakespeare ==

&quot;Willobie his Avisa&quot; was licensed for the press by printer John Windet on 3 September 1594. In the printed text, the poem is preceded by two commendatory poems, the second of which, signed &quot;Contraria Contrariis; Vigilantius; Dormitanus,&quot; contains a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, published four months previously:

:&quot;Yet Tarquyne pluckt his glistering grape,
:And Shake-speare paints poore Lucrece rape.&quot;

This is the earliest known printed allusion to Shakespeare by name (aside from the title pages of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;Lucrece&quot;).

The poem itself concerns a female character, Avisa (whose name is explained in Dorrell&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Reader&quot; as an acronym for &quot;Amans Uxor Inviolata Semper Amanda&quot;). Avisa tells a story alternately with her suitors, one of whom is introduced to the reader in a prose interlude signed by the author as &quot;Henrico Willobego Italo Hispalensis&quot;. This passage contains a reference which may be to Shakespeare. It runs as follows (&#x27;H.W.&#x27; refers to Willobie, and &#x27;A&#x27; to Avisa):

:&quot;H. W. being suddenly infected with the contagion of a fantastical fit, at the first sight of A, ... bewrayeth the secresy of his disease unto his familiar frend W. S., who not long before had tried the courtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered ... he determined to see whether it would sort to a happier end for this new actor, than it did for the old player.&quot; (spelling modernized)

Then follows a dialogue between H. W. and W. S., in which the latter gives somewhat commonplace advice to the disconsolate wooer.

The use of the word &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;player&quot; in connection with the initials &#x27;W.S.&#x27; is suggestive that the latter may refer to Shakespeare. If so, and if the poem is autobiographical, it implies that Willobie was in love with a woman who had been previously involved with Shakespeare.

<text>Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (; 28 May 1925 – 18 May 2012) was a German lyric baritone and conductor of classical music. One of the most famous Lieder (art song) performers of the post-war period, he is best known as a singer of Franz Schubert&#x27;s Lieder, particularly &quot;Winterreise&quot; of which his recordings with accompanists Gerald Moore and Jörg Demus are still critically acclaimed half a century after their release.

Recording an array of repertoire (spanning centuries) as musicologist Alan Blyth asserted, &quot;No singer in our time, or probably any other has managed the range and versatility of repertory achieved by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Opera, Lieder and oratorio in German, Italian or English came alike to him, yet he brought to each a precision and individuality that bespoke his perceptive insights into the idiom at hand.&quot; In addition, he recorded in French, Russian, Hebrew, Latin and Hungarian. He was described as &quot;one of the supreme vocal artists of the 20th century&quot; and &quot;the most influential singer of the 20th Century&quot;.

Fischer-Dieskau was ranked the second greatest singer of the century (after Jussi Björling) by Classic CD (United Kingdom) &quot;Top Singers of the Century&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll (June 1999). The French dubbed him &quot;Le miracle Fischer-Dieskau&quot; and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf called him &quot;a born god who has it all.&quot; At his peak, he was greatly admired for his interpretive insights and exceptional control of his soft, beautiful instrument. He dominated both the opera and concert platforms for over thirty years.

==Early years==
Albert Dietrich Fischer was born in 1925 in Berlin to Albert Fischer, a school principal, and Theodora (née Klingelhoffer) Fischer, a teacher. In 1934, his father added the hyphenated &quot;Dieskau&quot; to the family name (through his mother, he was descended from the Kammerherr von Dieskau, for whom Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the &quot;Peasant Cantata&quot;). He started singing as a child and began formal voice lessons at the age of 16. When he was drafted into the Wehrmacht during World War II in 1943, tending horses on the Russian Front, Fischer-Dieskau had just completed his secondary school studies and one semester at the Berlin Conservatory. He served in Grenadier Regiment 146 of the 65th Infantry Division south of Bologna in the winter of 1944–45 and entertained his comrades at soldiers&#x27; evenings behind the lines.

He was captured in Italy in 1945 and spent two years as an American prisoner of war. During that time, he sang Lieder in POW camps to homesick German soldiers. He had a physically and intellectually impaired brother, Martin, who was sent to an institution by the Nazi regime and starved to death. His family home was also destroyed during the war.

==Singing career==
In 1947, Fischer-Dieskau returned to Germany, where he launched his professional career as a singer in Badenweiler, singing in Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot; without any rehearsal. (He was a last-minute substitute for an indisposed singer.) He gave his first Lieder recital in Leipzig in the autumn of 1947 and followed it soon afterwards with a highly successful first concert at Berlin&#x27;s Titania-Palast.

From early in his career he collaborated with famous lyric sopranos Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Irmgard Seefried, and the recording producer Walter Legge, issuing instantly successful albums of Lieder by Schubert and Hugo Wolf.

In the autumn of 1948, Fischer-Dieskau was engaged as principal lyric baritone at the Städtische Oper Berlin (Municipal Opera, West Berlin), making his debut as Posa in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; under Ferenc Fricsay. This company, known after 1961 as the Deutsche Oper, would remain his artistic home until his retirement from the operatic stage, in 1978.

Subsequently, Fischer-Dieskau made guest appearances at the opera houses in Vienna and Munich. After 1949 he made concert tours in the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Italy. In 1951, he made his Salzburg Festival concert debut with Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer)&quot; under Wilhelm Furtwängler. That year, he also made his British debut, at the Royal Albert Hall in London during the Festival of Britain. He appeared in Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Mass of Life&quot;, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. He made regular opera appearances at the Bayreuth Festival between 1954 and 1961 and at the Salzburg Festival from 1956 until the early 1970s.

As an opera singer, Fischer-Dieskau performed mainly in Berlin and at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, at the Hamburg State Opera, in Japan, and at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Edinburgh, during the Edinburgh Festival. His first tour in the United States took place in 1955, when he was 29, with his concert debut in Cincinnati on 15 April (J. S. Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen&quot; ) (BWV 56) and 16 April (&quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot;). His American Lieder debut, singing Franz Schubert songs, took place in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on 19 April. His New York City debut occurred on 2 May at The Town Hall, where he sang Schubert&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Winterreise&quot; without an interval. Both American recitals were accompanied by Gerald Moore.

In 1951, Fischer-Dieskau made his first of many recordings of Lieder with Gerald Moore at Abbey Road Studios in London, including a complete &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot;, and they performed the work on 31 January 1952 at the Kingsway Hall, London, in the Mysore Concerts of the Philharmonia Concert Society. They gave recitals together until Moore retired from public performance in 1967. They continued, however, to record together until 1972, in which year they completed their massive project of recording all of the Schubert lieder appropriate for the male voice. Gerald Moore retired completely in 1972, and died in 1987, aged 87. Their recordings of &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; and &quot;Winterreise&quot; are highly prized as examples of their artistic partnership.

Fischer-Dieskau also performed many works of contemporary music, including Benjamin Britten (who chose Fischer-Dieskau as the baritone soloist when writing &quot;War Requiem&quot;), Samuel Barber, Hans Werner Henze, Karl Amadeus Hartmann (who wrote his &quot;Gesangsszene&quot; for him), Charles Ives, Ernst Krenek, Witold Lutosławski, Siegfried Matthus, Othmar Schoeck, Winfried Zillig, Gottfried von Einem and Aribert Reimann. He participated in the 1975 premiere and 1993 recording of Gottfried von Einem&#x27;s cantata &quot;An die Nachgeborenen&quot;, written in 1973 as a commission of the UN, both with Julia Hamari and the Wiener Symphoniker conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini.

Beyond his recordings of Lieder and the German opera repertoire, Fischer-Dieskau also recorded performances in the Italian operatic field. His recordings of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (alongside Renata Scotto and Carlo Bergonzi) and Rodrigo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, are probably the most respected of these ventures. (Others, such as the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (with Elena Souliotis), Giorgio Germont in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, and Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; (with Birgit Nilsson), are not delivered by him with the same degree of effectiveness.) As conductor Ferenc Fricsay put it, &quot;I never dreamed I&#x27;d find an Italian baritone in Berlin.&quot;

==Retirement==
Fischer-Dieskau retired from opera in 1978, the year he recorded his final opera, Aribert Reimann&#x27;s &quot;Lear&quot;, which the composer had written at his suggestion. He retired from the concert hall as of New Year&#x27;s Day, 1993, at 67, and dedicated himself to conducting, teaching (especially the interpretation of Lieder), painting and writing books. He still performed as a reciter, reading for example the letters of Strauss to Hugo von Hofmannsthal (whose part was read by Gert Westphal), for the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1994; and both performing and recording Strauss&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;. He also became an honorary member of the Robert Schumann Society.

==Recognition==
Throughout his career, his musicianship and technique were frequently described as flawless by critics. As Greg Sandow of Opera News put it, &quot;Overall, his technique is breath-taking; someone should build a monument to it.&quot;

As &#x27;the world&#x27;s greatest Lieder singer&#x27; (Time magazine), he regularly sold out concert halls all over the world until his retirement at the end of 1992. The precisely articulated accuracy of his performances, in which text and music were presented as equal partners, established standards that endure today. The current widespread interest in German Romantic art song is mainly due to his efforts. Perhaps most admired as a singer of Schubert Lieder, Fischer-Dieskau had, according to critic Joachim Kaiser, only one really serious competitor – himself, as over the decades he set new standards, explored new territories and expressed unanticipated feelings and emotions.

Few artists achieve the level of recognition, admiration and influence of Fischer-Dieskau, and even fewer live to see that influence realised during their own lifetime. Ushering in the modern recording era, he challenged our perception and processes of how recordings could be made, explored the possibilities of modern recording and exploited the potential for the popularity of classical music – and all this while setting standards of artistic achievement, integrity, risk-taking, and of the aesthetic ideal that became our new norm. Whenever we bask in the beauty of his tone, revere the probing, questioning power of his intellect, or simply wonder at the astonishing physical abilities throughout all that he has achieved in his long recording career, we must also pause and say THANK YOU to this great artist, whose legacy, like a great and bright star lighting the way for those who follow in his passion for singing, is exemplary in every way.—Thomas Hampson, May 2012, Hall of Fame, Gramophone Magazine.

After Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s death, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, France&#x27;s most internationally known newspaper, wrote that Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s vocal artistry bordered on a miracle (&quot;cela tenait du miracle&quot;): &quot;As soon as he opened his mouth, they believed every word he sang. Not a single word, not an intention, not a nuance did he pass over in his diction&quot; (&quot;dès qu&#x27;il ouvrait la bouche, on y croyait. Pas un mot, pas une intention, pas une nuance n&#x27;échappait à sa diction&quot;). In an obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s longtime accompanist in lieder, called the baritone a &quot;revolutionary performer&quot; because he was the first singer ever to succeed as a single person in delivering equally extraordinary performances in all three genres: opera, oratorio and lieder:

==Awards==

* Praemium Imperiale 2002
* Polar Music Prize 2005

* Won five Grammy Awards: in 1970, 1972, 1977, 1988, and 2000.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Fischer-Dieskau married the cellist Irmgard Poppen. Together they had three sons: Mathias (a stage designer), Martin (a conductor), and Manuel (a cellist with the Cherubini Quartet). Irmgard died in 1963 of complications following childbirth. Afterwards, Fischer-Dieskau was married to the actress Ruth Leuwerik, from 1965 to 1967, and Kristina Pugell, from 1968 to 1975. In 1977 he married the soprano Júlia Várady.

His older brother Klaus Fischer-Dieskau was a notable Berlin choral director who conducted for Fischer-Dieskau several times, including in his only recording of a passion by Heinrich Schütz in 1961.

Fischer-Dieskau smoked during a large part of his career. In an interview with &quot;B.Z.-News aus Berlin&quot; in 2002 he said, &quot;I quit smoking 20 years ago. I smoked for 35 years, and then stopped in a single day.&quot;

==Death==
On 18 May 2012, Fischer-Dieskau died in his sleep at his home in Berg, Upper Bavaria, 10 days before his 87th birthday.

<text>Nicholas Rowe (; 20 June 1674 – 6 December 1718) was an English dramatist, poet and miscellaneous writer who was appointed Poet Laureate in 1715. His plays and poems were well-received during his lifetime, with one of his translations described as one of the greatest productions in English poetry. He was also considered the first editor of the works of William Shakespeare.

==Life==
Nicholas Rowe was born in Little Barford, Bedfordshire, England, son of John Rowe (d. 1692), barrister and sergeant-at-law, and Elizabeth, daughter of Jasper Edwards, on 20 June 1674. His family possessed a considerable estate at Lamerton in Devonshire. His father practised law and published Benlow&#x27;s and Dallison&#x27;s Reports during the reign of King James II.

The future Poet Laureate was educated first at Highgate School, and then at Westminster School under the guidance of Richard Busby. In 1688, Rowe became a King&#x27;s Scholar, which was followed by his entrance into Middle Temple in 1691. His entrance into Middle Temple was decided upon by his father, who felt that Rowe had made sufficient progress to qualify him to study law. While at Middle Temple, he read statutes and reports with proficiency proportionate to the force of his mind, which was already such that he endeavoured to comprehend law, not as a series of precedents, or collection of positive precepts, but as a system of rational government and impartial justice.

On his father&#x27;s death, when he was nineteen, he became the master of an independent fortune. He was left to his own direction, and from that time ignored law to try his hand first at poetry, and then later at writing plays.

Rowe acted as under-secretary (1709–1711) to the Duke of Queensberry when he was principal secretary of state for Scotland. On the accession of George I, Rowe was made a surveyor of customs, and in 1715 he succeeded Nahum Tate as poet laureate.

He was also appointed clerk of the council to the Prince of Wales, and in 1718 was nominated by Lord Chancellor Parker as clerk of the presentations in Chancery. He died on 6 December 1718, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. A monument was erected to his memory in the Abbey by John Michael Rysbrack c. 1722.

:The inscription on his tomb reads as follows:
::&quot;To the Memory of NICHOLAS ROWE Esq: who died in 1718 Aged 45, And of Charlotte his only daughter the wife of Henry Fane Esq; who, inheriting her Father&#x27;s Spirit, and Amiable in her own Innocence &amp; Beauty, died in the 22nd year of her age 1739.&quot;
::&quot;Thy Reliques, Rowe, to this sad Shrine we trust, and near thy Shakespear place thy honour&#x27;d Bust, Oh next him skill&#x27;ed to draw the tender Tear, For never Heart felt Passion more sincere: To nobler sentiment to fire the Brave. For never Briton more disdain&#x27;d a Slave: Peace to the gentle Shade, and endless Rest, Blest in thy Genius, in thy love too blest; And blest, that timely from Our Scene remov&#x27;d Thy Soul enjoys that Liberty it lov&#x27;d.&quot;

::&quot;To these, so mourn&#x27;d in Death, so lov&#x27;d in Life! The childless Parent &amp; the widow&#x27;d wife With tears inscribes this monument Stone, That holds their Ashes &amp; expects her own.&quot;

Upon his death his widow received a pension from George I in 1719 in recognition of her husband&#x27;s translation of Lucan. This verse translation, or rather paraphrase of the &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, was called by Samuel Johnson one of the greatest productions in English poetry, and was widely read, running through eight editions between 1718 and 1807.

==Family==

Rowe was first married to a woman with the family name Parsons (whose given name is unknown), with whom he had a son John. His second wife was Anne Devenish, and they had a daughter named Charlotte. Daniel Lysons and Samuel Lysons noted that he did not have descendants after his son died childless.

==Works==

&quot;The Ambitious Stepmother&quot;, Rowe&#x27;s first play, produced in 1700 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields by Thomas Betterton and set in Persepolis, was well received. This was followed in 1701 by &quot;Tamerlane&quot;. In this play the conqueror Timur represented William III, and Louis XIV is denounced as Bajazet. It was for many years regularly acted on the anniversary of William&#x27;s landing at Torbay. In Dublin in 1712, at a time when political passions were running high, the performance provoked a serious riot.

&quot;The Fair Penitent&quot; (1702, published 1703), an adaptation of Massinger and Field&#x27;s &quot;The Fatal Dowry&quot;, was pronounced by Samuel Johnson as one of the most pleasing tragedies ever written in English. It featured the character of Lothario, whose name, as a result of this play, became synonymous with a rake (womaniser). Calista is said to have suggested to Samuel Richardson the character of Clarissa Harlowe, as Lothario suggested Lovelace. Samuel Johnson noted of &quot;The Fair Penitent&quot;, &quot;The story is domestic, and therefore easily received by the imagination, and assimilated to common life; the diction is exquisitely harmonious, and soft or spritely as occasion requires.&quot;

In 1704, Rowe tried his hand at comedy, producing &quot;The Biter&quot; at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, which was unsuccessful, and Rowe returned to tragedy in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1705). According to Johnson, this play was to share the fate of many such plays based on mythological heroes, as, &quot;We have been too early acquainted with the poetical heroes to expect any pleasure from their revival.&quot;

&quot;The Royal Convert&quot; (1707) was a story about a love triangle between two brothers, Hengist and Aribert, and a Christian woman named Ethelinda, who is martyred.

&quot;Jane Shore&quot;, professedly an imitation of Shakespeare&#x27;s style, was played at Drury Lane with Anne Oldfield in the title role in 1714. It ran for nineteen nights, and kept the stage longer than any other of Rowe&#x27;s works. In the play, which consists chiefly of domestic scenes and private distress, the wife is forgiven because she repents, and the husband is honoured because he forgives.

&quot;The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey&quot; followed in 1715, and as this play was not successful, it was his last foray into the medium.

Rowe published the first 18th-century edition of William Shakespeare in six volumes in 1709 (printed by Tonson) and is also considered the first editor of Shakespeare. His practical knowledge of the stage helped him divide the plays into scenes (and sometime acts), with the entrances and exits of the players noted. He also normalised the spelling of names and prefixed each play with a list of the &quot;dramatis personae&quot;. This 1709 edition was also the first to be illustrated, a frontispiece engraving being provided for each play. Unfortunately, Rowe based his text on the corrupt Fourth Folio, a course which was followed by many later 18th-century editors who followed in his editorial footsteps. Rowe also wrote a short biography of Shakespeare, entitled, &quot;Some Account of the Life &amp;c. of Mr. William Shakespear&quot;.

Rowe wrote occasional verses addressed to Godolphin and Halifax, adapted some of the odes of Horace to fit contemporary events, and translated the &quot;Caractères&quot; of Jean de La Bruyère and the &quot;Callipaedia&quot; of Claude Quillet. He also wrote a memoir of Boileau prefixed to a translation of the &quot;Lutrin&quot;. He also wrote a version of Lucan&#x27;s Pharsalia.

<doc id="468870" wikidata="Q482460" url="?curid=468870" title="White Day">
<text>White Day is celebrated annually on March 14, one month after Valentine&#x27;s Day, when men give reciprocal gifts to women who gave them gifts on Valentine&#x27;s Day. It began in Japan in 1978; its observance has spread to several other East Asian nations like China, Taiwan, South Korea and countries worldwide.

== Origin ==
Though Valentine&#x27;s Day was being celebrated in Japan by 1936, it did not begin to be popular until the 1970s, giving the day a different meaning from the Western observation. It was primarily an opportunity for girls to show that they like a boy. In 1977, a Fukuoka-based confectionery company, , marketed marshmallows to men on March 14, calling it . White Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan. The National Confectionery Industry Association started it as an &quot;answer day&quot; to Valentine&#x27;s Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Soon thereafter, confectionery companies began marketing white chocolate. Flowers and other gifts are also given on this day.

== Observation ==
White Day is celebrated one month after Valentine&#x27;s Day, on March 14. With countries that observe White Day, typically Valentine&#x27;s Day is celebrated by women and girls presenting chocolate gifts (either store-bought or handmade), usually to the other men and boys, as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation.

On White Day, the reverse happens: men who received a or on Valentine&#x27;s Day are expected to return the favor by giving gifts to the women. Gift exchanges happen between romantic partners, friends, and coworkers. Traditionally, popular White Day gifts include food like white chocolate, marshmallows, candy, cookies, and other &quot;white&quot; accessories like jewelry, bags, lotions, and lingerie. 

Sometimes the term is used to describe the generally recited rule for men that the return gift should be two to three times the worth of the Valentine&#x27;s gift they received.

In the latter half of the 2010s, sales figures indicated a decline in the popularity of the observation. It was seen as a result of reduced sales of obligation chocolates on Valentine&#x27;s Day. Another reason given for the reduction of popularity is the changing gender roles within Japanese culture.

=== International observation ===
Outside of Japan, the practice of giving response gifts one month after Valentine&#x27;s Day has spread internationally. In those cultures, White Day is, for the most part, observed similarly. Some places where this occurs include China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

<text>Thomas Betterton (August 1635 – 28 April 1710), the leading male actor and theatre manager during Restoration England, son of an under-cook to King Charles I, was born in London.

==Apprentice and actor==
Betterton was born in August 1635 in Tothill Street, Westminster. He was apprenticed to John Holden, Sir William Davenant&#x27;s publisher, and possibly later to a bookseller named John Rhodes, who had been wardrobe-keeper at the Blackfriars Theatre. In 1659, Rhodes obtained a license to set up a company of players at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane; and on the reopening of this theatre in 1660, Betterton made his first appearance on the stage.

Betterton&#x27;s talents at once brought him into prominence, and he was given leading parts. On the opening of the new theatre in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1661, Davenant, the patentee of the Duke&#x27;s Company, engaged Betterton and all Rhodes&#x27;s company to play in his &quot;The Siege of Rhodes&quot;. Also in 1661 he played Prince Alvaro in Davenant&#x27;s &quot;Love and Honour&quot;. Betterton, besides being a public favourite, was held in high esteem by Charles II, who sent him to Paris to examine stage improvements there. According to Cibber, after his return to England, it was the first time that the shifting scenes replaced tapestry in an English theatre.

In 1662 he married the actress Mary Saunderson (died 1712). She started her professional career playing some major female roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. She and her husband Thomas Betterton shared the stage in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which she played Ophelia, opposite to Betterton&#x27;s Hamlet.They also played Bosola and The Duchess in Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; in the early 1660s. In the meantime, she was also her husband&#x27;s consultant and business partner. In an age when the profession of acting was often thought as notorious and indecent, and actors, both male and female were unfairly criticized as whores, the Bettertons were still regarded as respectable. They were invited to teach the children from noble and royal families to perform John Crowne&#x27;s &quot;Calisto&quot;, 1675, in the last Stuart court Masque.

In appearance he was athletic, slightly above middle height, with a tendency to stoutness; his voice was strong rather than melodious, but in recitation it was used with the greatest dexterity. Pepys, Pope, Steele, and Cibber all bestow lavish praise on his acting. His repertory included a large number of Shakespearian roles, many of them presented in the versions adapted by Davenant, Dryden, Shadwell and Nahum Tate. Even though those adapted versions did not receive critical acclaim, they did not harm or shadow Betterton&#x27;s acting either. Still, his performances were largely praised. He played Lear opposite Elizabeth Barry&#x27;s Cordelia in Tate&#x27;s modified version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. Betterton was himself author of several adaptations which were popular in their day.

==Actor and manager==
From Davenant&#x27;s death in 1668, Betterton was the de facto manager and director of the Duke&#x27;s Company, and from the merger of London&#x27;s two theatre companies in 1682, he continued to fulfill these functions in the new United Company. Enduring progressively worse conditions and terms in this money-grubbing monopoly (see Restoration spectacular and Restoration comedy), the top actors walked out in 1695 and set up a cooperative company in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields under Betterton&#x27;s leadership. The new company opened with the premiere of Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot; with an all-star cast including Betterton as Valentine and Anne Bracegirdle as Angelica. But in a few years the profits fell off; and Betterton, laboring under the infirmities of age and gout, determined to quit the stage. At his benefit performance, when the profits are said to have been over £500, he played Valentine in &quot;Love for Love&quot;.

Betterton&#x27;s career not only spans the period of Restoration theatre, it also marks its high point. There was a period of time when the size of theatre audience started to reduce, in order to revive people&#x27;s interest in theatre, he invented new stage machines at Dorset Garden Theatre, transposed &quot;The Prophetess&quot; into an opera, and introduced French singers and dancers to the Restoration stage. He also built the first permanent theatre fully equipped with Italianate machinery. Additionally, he invested in remodeling the tennis court in the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and built a new theatre there, therefore in addition to his salary, he also received a small amount of &quot;rent&quot; fees for each performance done there. Betterton worked with all of the most significant playwrights of his age and the first generation of English actresses. During his time, with the exception of William Mountfort, who gained a versatility in terms of portraying roles, most of Betterton&#x27;s contemporary actors deliberately restricted themselves to certain popular character-types. However Betterton had more than 120 different roles from the genres such as heroic drama, Jonsonian comedy, comedies of manners, tragicomedies by Beaumont and Fletcher, and tragedies, comedies and histories by Shakespeare. At the age of seventy-five, he claimed, &quot;He was yet learning to be an actor.&quot; The first acting guide published in English was &quot;The Life of Mr Thomas Betterton&quot;, which was mainly a pastiche from French rhetoric manuals with passages borrowed from English plays.

Betterson&#x27;s innovation in scenery and theatre management, and his contributions to theatre making shaped the culture of English theatre.

Betterton performed to within fifteen days of his death. Three days before his death at seventy-five, he made his last appearance on the stage in 1710, as Melantius in &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. He died shortly afterwards, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. From his debut as an actor in 1659 to his last appearance in 1710, his fifty-year career stretched nearly to the end of Stuart Dynasty. Thomas Betterton&#x27;s death marks the end of a generation.

==In popular culture==
Betterton is portrayed by Tom Wilkinson in the 2004 film &quot;Stage Beauty&quot;. Wilkinson was in his mid 50s at the time, yet the film is set around 1662, when Betterton would have been younger than 30.

<text>Noel Lynch (20 January 1947 – 3 August 2021) was an Irish politician living in England and a member of the Green Party of England and Wales. He represented the Green Party on the London Assembly between 2 May 2003 and 10 June 2004, after replacing Victor Anderson who resigned. Due to a fall in the Green vote, he did not retain his seat at the 2004 London Assembly election, leaving Darren Johnson and Jenny Jones as the remaining members of the London Assembly Green Group. He was Co-ordinator of the London Federation of Green Parties.

==Early life and career==
Lynch grew up in Kilmallock, County Limerick, in Ireland before moving to London in 1986. He was the convenor of the London Federation of Green Parties and Co-Convenor of the Green Party Trade Union Group. Lynch owned a shop that was described &#x27;as the most interesting in London&#x27; by Time Out Magazine.

Lynch&#x27;s first experience of electoral politics was when he contested the Limerick West constituency as an Independent in the 1969 Irish General Election.

Lynch was active in community politics in Finchley. He was also a founder member of &quot;The Archer&quot;, a community newspaper for the N2 area, and he founded the East Finchley Traders Association. He was on the Administrative Committee of the Finchley Society and spent six years as a voluntary adviser with the East Finchley Advice Centre. Before becoming a member of the London Assembly, he worked for the No-Euro campaign. In addition, he was the founder of an independent newspaper, &quot;London Green News&quot;.

Within the Green Party, Lynch founded the Green Party Trade Union Group and the London Internationals Group. He chaired the London-Irish Green Group and the London Green Party Animal Rights Group.

Lynch was fourth on the Green Party&#x27;s list of candidates for the Top-Up (Additional Member System) seats at the 2000 London Assembly elections (11 seats elected by proportional representation). Three Green Party Assembly Members - Darren Johnson, Jenny Jones and Victor Anderson - were elected to Top-Up seats. In May 2003, Anderson resigned and was replaced by Lynch. In the 2004 London Assembly election, the Green vote share in the top-up seats election fell from 11.1% in 2000 to 8.37% in 2004, meaning that the party lost their third seat, held by Lynch, leaving Johnson and Jones as the remaining members of the London Assembly Green Group.

As an Assembly Member, Lynch was a member of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA), the Metropolitan Police Authority, the Culture, Sport and Tourism Committee, the Planning and Spatial Development Committee, the Health Committee and the Standards Committee (of which he was Chair). He focused on health issues, the homeless, GM crops, fluoride, the aged, disability issues and animal rights. He campaigned successfully to save Cricklewood Homeless Centre and improved the then fledgling Patients Forum of the London Ambulance Service. He organised conferences in City Hall on GM Crops and Non-animal Medical Research. He wrote four papers - &quot;Where Have All the Local Shops Gone?&quot;, &quot;Plastic not Fantastic&quot; (against plastic bag waste), &quot;Toilets Going to Waste&quot; (on the decline in public toilets) and &quot;Keep Off the Grass - the Loss of London&#x27;s Playing Fields&quot;. In addition, he asked 157 formal questions to the Mayor on a wide range of issues.

In 2003, Lynch was the Green Party&#x27;s candidate at the Brent East by-election, securing 3.1% of the vote (638 votes) and coming fourth. He was the party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for the Finchley and Golders Green constituency, where he came fourth with 1136 votes (2.6%) in the General Election of 2005.

Lynch was third on the Green Party&#x27;s list of candidates for the Top-Up (Additional Member System) seats at the 2008 London Assembly elections, but the Green Party did not receive enough votes to elect a third Assembly member. He was again third on the Green Party list for the 2012 London Assembly election. He was fourth on the list for 2016.

A tribute to Lynch was published on the City Hall website upon his death.

<text>Anne Oldfield (168323 October 1730) was an English actress and one of the highest paid actresses of her time.

==Early life and discovery==
She was born in London in 1683. Her father was a soldier, James Oldfield. Her mother was either Anne or Elizabeth Blanchard. Her grandfather owned a tavern and left her father several properties, he however mortgaged these which resulted in Anne and her mother being placed in financial difficulty when he died young. It appears that Oldfield received some education because her biographers state that she read widely in her youth. Oldfield and her mother went to live with her aunt, Mrs Voss, in the Mitre tavern, St James. In 1699, she attracted George Farquhar&#x27;s attention when he overheard her reciting lines from Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher&#x27;s play &quot;The Scornful Lady&quot; (1616) in a back room of her tavern. Soon after, she was hired by Christopher Rich to join the cast of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

==Career==
A year later she was cast in her first small role as Candiope in John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Secret Love; or, The Maiden Queen&quot; (1699). After her success in a minor role, she was given the lead in John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (1647). In the summer of 1703, Oldfield replaced Susanna Verbruggen when her contract was terminated before the company travelled to Bath to perform for Queen Anne and her court.

Oldfield became one of Drury Lane&#x27;s leading actresses. Colley Cibber acknowledged that she had as much as he to do with the success of his &quot;The Careless Husband&quot; (1704), in which she created the part of Lady Modish. Speaking of her portrayal of Lady Townly in his &quot;The Provoked Husband&quot; (1728), Cibber was to say, &quot;that here she outdid her usual Outdoing&quot;. She also played the title role in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot;, and Celia in his &quot;Volpone&quot;.

Contemporary gossip is recorded that there were rivalries between Oldfield, Anne Bracegirdle, Jane Rogers and Susannah Centlivre, all of whom were supposedly vying for the best roles. In 1706 Oldfield came into conflict with the Drury Lane&#x27;s management over benefits and salary she believed she had been promised, but which the theatre refused to pay. Oldfield left and joined the competing acting company at Haymarket Theatre before returning to Drury Lane shortly after with a fresh contract and a new position as joint-sharer of the Drury Lane Theatre. On a separate occasion, Oldfield was offered to become manager of the Theatre, &quot;but her sex was thought to be an objection to that measure&quot; thus being asked to name her own terms to stay in her old position, Oldfield received 200 guineas salary, which was ultimately raised to 500 guineas resulting in Oldfield becoming the highest paid actress of her time.
==Personal life==
Oldfield began a decade-long relationship with Whig politician Arthur Maynwaring around 1700. Owing to her success, Oldfield remained financially independent from Maynwaring. He supported her career by helping her work through new roles and by writing more than a dozen prologues and epilogues for her to perform. When she became pregnant with their son, Arthur. Oldfield kept acting until she was physically unable, which was unusual for the time. She went back to work just three months after the birth. Oldfield arranged for her lifelong friend, Margaret Saunders, to join the acting profession.

When Maynwaring died in 1712, rumours circulated that he had died from a venereal disease that Oldfield had given to him. In order to clear both their names, she ordered an official autopsy to be performed on his body, which revealed that he had died of tuberculosis. Oldfield was three months pregnant at the time, but her child is not believed to have survived the birth.

Several years after Maynwaring&#x27;s death, Oldfield began a relationship with Charles Churchill. The two lived together for many years and had a son, Charles. However, during this pregnancy, Oldfield was unable to continue acting due to her health, and was forced to leave the theatre for several months. She never fully recovered her health.

Throughout her last theatrical season she suffered from chronic pain in her abdomen. She retired from the stage in April 1730 and died from cancer of the uterus a few months later.

Oldfield died on 23 October 1730 at age 47, at 60 Grosvenor Street, London. She divided her property between her two sons. Oldfield was buried in Westminster Abbey, beneath the monument to Congreve. Her partner, Churchill, applied for permission to erect a monument there to her memory, but the dean of Westminster refused it.

==Memorial==

Alexander Pope, in his &quot;Sober Advice from Horace&quot;, wrote of her &quot;Engaging Oldfield, who, with grace and ease, Could join the arts to ruin and to please.&quot; Oldfield had said to her maid &quot;No, let a charming chintz and Brussels lace Wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face; One would not, sure, be frightful when one&#x27;s dead, And Betty give this cheek a little red.&quot;
