<text>.nfo (also written .NFO or NFO, a contraction of &quot;info&quot;, or &quot;information&quot;) is a filename extension for text files that accompany warez scene releases of pirated software or media.

NFO files contain information about the release, such as the digital media title, authorship, year, or license information. This information is delivered for publishing through digital media to make it searchable on the web as well as within local catalogues and libraries.

== Content ==

NFO files usually contain release information about the media. The information may include authorship and license information. If the NFO file is for software, product installation notes can also be found. NFO files are also often found in demoscene productions, where the respective groups include them for credits, contact details, and the software requirements.

Unlike README files, NFO files often contain elaborate ANSI art.

== History ==

NFO files were first introduced by &quot;Fabulous Furlough&quot; of the elite PC warez organization called The Humble Guys, or THG. The THG group would first upload their package to their world headquarters, &quot;Candyland BBS&quot; or later &quot;The P.I.T.S. BBS&quot;, to establish distribution immediately. Such organizations are also known as warez groups or crack groups. The first use came in 1990 on the THG release of the PC game &quot;Knights of Legend&quot;. This file was used in lieu of the more common README.TXT or README.1ST file names. The perpetuation of this file extension legacy was carried on by warez groups which followed after THG and is still in use to this day. Hence its strong presence on Usenet newsgroups that carry binaries and on P2P file trading networks.

The Humble Guys later became a demogroup, thus bringing the .nfo file tradition into the demoscene. More than forty thousand demoscene productions have an NFO file next to the program file.

Before Windows 95 was introduced, NFO files also sometimes used ANSI-escape sequences to generate animated ASCII art (ANSI art). These animations, however, required ANSI.SYS to be loaded by the DOS shell. If the user&#x27;s computer wasn&#x27;t already configured to load the ANSI.SYS driver, viewing ANSI art required reconfiguring and rebooting. Because of this, ANSI art was much less common, and getting ANSI art to display correctly on a Windows 95 PC often proved more difficult, leading to a decline of such art in NFO files.

The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code page 437 character set was originally designed by IBM for the earliest DOS PCs so many years ago. Therefore, it was not destined to become standardized throughout the non-English world. Recently to aid internationalization, instead of using the old code page 437 extended ASCII characters, modern ASCII art uses the current de facto web standard ISO-8859-1/ISO-8859-15 or Unicode UTF-8 characters.

=== Usage of NFO files in publishing of warez ===
The files have been explained as essentially being the press releases of the warez scene. They are commonly associated with warez groups who include them to declare credit of said release. NFO files were ubiquitous, and sometimes required, during the era of the BBS. The file was a stamp of authenticity, explicitly explaining what group released the software and described what modifications (or cracks) were applied if any. Once a software was &quot;packaged&quot; with an NFO and then released, it was then officially owned by that group and no other group could ethically re-release that particular package. A typical warez NFO file was elaborate and highly decorated, and usually included a large ASCII art logo along with software release and extended warez group information. The most important information is which group, which cracker and which member actually tested and packaged. The designers of these NFO files, who worked closely or within the warez groups, frequently incorporated extended ASCII characters from the character set code page 437 in the file.

As of 2019, NFO files can still be found in many ZIP archives. In modern-day warez NFO files, a large ASCII art logo is frequently shown at the top, followed by textual information below.

== Software ==
The home theater software Kodi uses NFO files for its library. Plex Media Server uses NFO files for match movie library. Filebot app fetch artwork and create NFO files for TV shows or movies. NFO files are also used by media managers ViMediaManager, tinyMediaManager, Ember Media Manager, CouchPotato - a usenet and torrents client, MediaElch, TV show organiser Media Companion, digital media library manager Media Center Master. An NFO plug-in is also available for Opus, an open access repositories software.

NFO files are plain text files. The simplest method to view is using a text editor and selecting a monospace font and set &quot;US Latin&quot; or &quot;extended ASCII&quot;. On Windows 95 using Microsoft Notepad the Terminal font set to 11pt usually produced a good rendering of ascii art on common CRTs of the time and could be set as the default viewer NFO files. However, web browsers use an incompatible alternative encoding scheme resulting in incorrect rendering of NFO files. Also, many modern text editors often use proportional fonts whereas the ASCII art included in both old and new NFO files is heavily dependent on the file being viewed with a fixed-width font. For this reason dedicated NFO viewers are available which are text editors with appropriate fonts (such as Terminus) and encoding settings, automatic window size and clickable hyperlinks. Additionally, online NFO viewers are also available to browse public NFO databases.

== Microsoft Windows ==

On Microsoft Windows, the NFO filename extension is associated with a Microsoft software tool called &quot;System Information&quot; (msinfo32.exe). System Information provides a general overview of a computer&#x27;s system specifications as well as detailed information on the system&#x27;s hardware components and information about the Windows environment. NFO files that are meant for System Information contain all of the information that System Information displays saved in an XML format.

<doc id="482581" wikidata="Q752660" url="?curid=482581" title="Candomblé">
<text>Candomblé () is an African diasporic religion that developed in Brazil during the 19th century. It arose through a process of syncretism between several of the traditional religions of West and Central Africa, especially those of the Yoruba, Bantu, and Gbe, coupled with influences from Roman Catholicism. There is no central authority in control of Candomblé, which is organized around autonomous &quot;terreiros&quot; (houses).

Candomblé venerates spirits, known varyingly as &quot;orixás&quot;, &quot;inkice&quot;, or &quot;vodun&quot;, which are deemed subservient to a transcendent creator god, Oludumaré. Deriving their names and attributes from traditional West African deities, the &quot;orixás&quot; are linked with Roman Catholic saints. Each individual is believed to have a tutelary &quot;orixá&quot; who has been connected to them since before birth and who informs their personality. An initiatory tradition, Candomblé&#x27;s members usually meet in &quot;terreiros&quot; run by a &quot;mãe de santo&quot; (priestess) or &quot;pai de santo&quot; (priest). A central ritual involves practitioners drumming, singing, and dancing to encourage an &quot;orixá&quot; to possess one of their members, with whom congregants can then interact. The &quot;orixás&quot; are given offerings such as fruit and sacrificed animals, while their will is deciphered through divination. Offerings may also be given to lesser spirits, including &quot;caboclos&quot; and the spirits of the dead, the &quot;egun&quot;. Healing rituals and the preparation of amulets and herbal remedies also play a prominent role.

Candomblé developed among Afro-Brazilian communities amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. It arose through the blending of the traditional religions brought to Brazil by enslaved West and Central Africans, the majority of them Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu, with the Roman Catholicism of the Portuguese colonialists who then controlled the area. It primarily coalesced in the Bahia region during the 19th century. Following Brazil&#x27;s independence from Portugal, the constitution of 1891 enshrined freedom of religion in the country, although Candomblé remained marginalized by the Roman Catholic establishment, which typically associated it with criminality. In the 20th century, growing emigration from Bahia spread Candomblé both throughout Brazil and abroad, while also influencing the development of another religion, Umbanda, in the 1920s. Since the late 20th century, some practitioners have emphasized a re-Africanization process to remove Roman Catholic influences and create forms of Candomblé closer to traditional West African religion.

The religion is divided into denominations, known as nations, based on which traditional African belief system has been its primary influence. The most prominent nations are the Ketu, Jeje, and Angola. Candomblé is centred in Brazil although smaller communities exist elsewhere, especially in other parts of South America. Both in Brazil and abroad Candomblé has spread beyond its Afro-Brazilian origins and is practiced by individuals of various ethnicities.

==Definition and terminology ==
Candomblé is a &quot;neo-African&quot; or African American religion, and more specifically an Afro-Brazilian religion. It arose in 19th-century Brazil, where the imported traditional African religions of enslaved West Africans had to adapt to a slave colony in which Roman Catholicism was the official religion. It is thus one of several religions that emerged in the Americas through the interaction of West African and Roman Catholic traditions, and for this reason is considered a &quot;sister religion&quot; of Cuban Santería and Haitian Vodou. 

Candomblé&#x27;s followers are called &quot;povo de santo&quot; (people of saint), or &quot;Candomblecistas&quot;. The term &quot;Candomblé&quot; itself probably derives from a Bantu word for dances, &quot;kandombele&quot;, which also developed into the term for a dance style in Argentina and Uruguay, &quot;Candombe&quot;. Another word sometimes applied to Candomblé is &quot;macumba&quot;; this generic term can be applied to Afro-Brazilian religions as a whole but is especially associated with sorcery or black magic, and thus some Candomblécistas distance themselves from it.

Candomblé is not institutionalised, with no central authority to determine doctrine and orthodoxy, and no central sacred text. It is heterogenous, displaying regional variation in its beliefs and practices. Each lineage or community of practitioners is autonomous, approaching the religion in ways informed by their tradition and the choices of their leader. 

Most Candomblecistas also practice Roman Catholicism—some priests and priestesses of Candomblé refuse to initiate anyone who is not a baptised Roman Catholic—while other practitioners have also pursued Evangelical Protestantism, New Age practices, or Buddhism. Sometimes these non-Candomblist elements have been directly integrated into Candomblé itself; there are reports of a Brazilian practitioner including a statue of the Mahayana Buddhist deity Hotei on their altar, and of a Belgian Candomblé group that incorporated characters from Welsh and Slavic mythologies in their practice. Candomblé has sometimes also been influenced by Spiritism, a French variant of Spiritualism, although many Spiritists distinguish their religion from Afro-Brazilian traditions. 

Afro-Brazilian religions often mix with each other rather than existing in pure forms, with many scholars viewing them on a continuum rather than as wholly discrete entities. Candomblé shares the names of its deities, the &quot;orixás&quot;, with Umbanda, a religion formed in Rio de Janeiro in the 1920s. Umbandista groups exist on a spectrum from those emphasising connections to Spiritism to those stressing links with Afro-Brazilian religions like Candomblé; the anthropologist Diana Brown noted that the boundary separating Umbanda from Candomblé was largely &quot;a matter of individual opinion&quot;. Omolocô was founded in Rio de Janeiro as an intermediate religion between Candomblé and Umbanda, with traditions merging these two systems sometimes labelled &quot;Umbandomblé&quot; by outsiders. There are also other Afro-Brazilian religions rooted largely in specific regions, including Babassuê in Pará, Batuque in Rio Grande do Sul, and Tambor de Mina in Maranhão and Pará. 

===&quot;Nações&quot;===

Candomblé divides into traditions known as &quot;nações&quot; (nations). The three most prominent are Nagô or Ketu (Queto), Jeje (Gege) or Mina-Jeje, and Angola or Congo-Angola; others include the Ijexá (Ijesha), Egba, Efan (Ekiti) and Caboclo. Each derives influence from a different African language group; Ketu uses Yoruba, Jeje adopts Ewe, and the Angola draws from the Bantu language group. Informed by these ethno-linguistic origins, each Candomblé nation has its own lexicon, chants, deities, sacred objects, and traditional knowledge. Although originating among ethnic differences, this has largely eroded over time, with members drawn to a nation for reasons other than ethnic heritage.

An initiate can transfer from one nation to another, a process referred to as &quot;trocar as águas&quot; (&quot;to change the waters&quot;). Attitudes between nations can be negative; those groups which emphasise claims to &quot;African purity&quot; have often denigrated other nations they deem more syncretic, with the Angola nation sometimes regarded as the most syncretic. The Nagô nation is the largest, reflecting how Yoruba traditional religion became the dominant West African influence within Afro-Brazilian religions in the 19th century, and even among nations other than the Nagô, Yoruba-derived terminology predominates widely.

==Beliefs==

===Olorun and the &quot;orixás&quot;===

Candomblé teaches the existence of a supreme divinity called Olorun or Olodumare. This entity is regarded as the creator of everything but is thought distant and unapproachable, and thus not specifically worshipped in Candomblé.

====The &quot;orixás&quot;====

Candomblé revolves around spirits termed &quot;orixás&quot; (&quot;orishas&quot;) or &quot;santos&quot; (&quot;saints&quot;). In the Angola tradition they are sometimes termed &quot;inkice&quot;, and in the Jeje tradition &quot;vodun&quot;. The males are termed &quot;aborôs&quot;, the females &quot;iabás&quot;. Believed to mediate between humanity and Olorun, the &quot;orixás&quot; have been varyingly conceived as ancestral figures, or embodiments of forces of nature. Their names may differ according to nation; in Nagô they commonly possess Yoruba names, but in the Jeje nation they are instead given Fon names.

The &quot;orixás&quot; are deemed morally ambiguous, each with their own virtues and flaws, and are sometimes in conflict with each other. Each &quot;orixá&quot; is associated with specific colours, foods, animals, and minerals, favoring certain offerings. Each &quot;orixá&quot; is associated with a particular day of the week; the priesthood also states that each year is governed by a specific &quot;orixá&quot; who will influence the events taking place within it. Their personalities are informed by a key conceptual opposition in Candomblé, that of the cool versus the hot.

Oxalá is the chief &quot;orixá&quot;, depicted as a frail old man who walks with a &quot;pachorô&quot; sceptre as a walking stick. Practitioners commonly believe that Olorun tasked him with creating humanity. In some accounts, all of the junior &quot;orixás&quot; are the children of Oxalá and one of his two wives, Nanã and Iemanjá. This trio are associated with water; Oxalá with fresh water, Nanã with the rain, and Iemanjá with the ocean. Other accounts present this cosmogony differently, for instance by claiming that Oxalá fathered all other &quot;orixás&quot; alone, having created the world from a mingau pudding. An alternative claim among practitioners is that Nanã is the grandmother of Oxalá and the mother of Iemanjá, the latter becoming both mother and wife to Oxalá.

Xangô is the &quot;orixá&quot; associated with thunder and lightning; one of his wives is Obá, a warrior who has only one ear. Ogum is the &quot;orixá&quot; of battle and of iron, often depicted with a machete; his companion is Oxóssi, the male &quot;orixá&quot; of the hunt and forest. Obaluaiê or Omolu is the &quot;orixá&quot; associated with infectious disease and its cure, while Osanyin is associated with leaves, herbs, and herbal knowledge. Oya is the &quot;orixá&quot; of wind and storms. Oxumaré is regarded as both male and female and is portrayed as a serpent or a rainbow. Oxum is the &quot;orixá&quot; of love, beauty, wealth and luxury, and is associated with fresh water, fish, mermaids, and butterflies. She is married to Ifa, regarded as the &quot;orixá&quot; of divination. 

Tempo is the &quot;orixá&quot; of time; originating in the Angola nation, he is associated with trees. Due to the link with trees, he is sometimes equated with the Nagô &quot;orixá&quot; Loko. The &quot;orixá&quot; Exú is regarded as a capricious trickster; as the guardian of entrances, he facilitates contact between humanity and the other &quot;orixá&quot;, thus usually being honoured and fed first in any ritual. His ritual paraphernalia is often kept separate from that of other &quot;orixás&quot;, while the entrances to most &quot;terreiros&quot; will have a clay head, decorated with cowries or nails, that represents Exú and is given offerings.

The &quot;orixás&quot; are regarded as having different aspects, known as &quot;marcas&quot; (&quot;types&quot; or &quot;qualities&quot;), each of which may have an individual name. Child forms of the &quot;orixás&quot; are termed &quot;erês&quot;. They are deemed the most uncontrollable spirits of all, associated with obscenities and pranks. The child forms of &quot;orixás&quot; have specific names; the &quot;erê&quot; of Oxalá is for instance called Ebozingo (&quot;Little Ebô&quot;) and Pombinho (&quot;Little Dove&quot;). 
The material image of an &quot;orixá&quot; is called an &quot;igbá&quot;.

====Saints====

Each &quot;orixá&quot; equates with a Roman Catholic saint. For instance, Omolu, an &quot;orixa&quot; of sickness, is often equated with Saint Lazarus the leper. Oxalá has been conflated with Our Lord of Bonfim, Oxum with Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, and Ogum with St Anthony of Padua. Due to his association with time, Tempo is sometimes equated with the Christian idea of the Holy Spirit. In Candomblé altars, the &quot;orixás&quot; are often represented with images and statues of Roman Catholic saints. 

This process may have begun as a subterfuge to retain the worship of African deities under European rule, although such syncretisms could have already been occurring in Africa prior to the Atlantic slave trade. From the later 20th century, some practitioners have attempted to distance the &quot;orixás&quot; from the saints as a means of re-emphasising the religion&#x27;s West African origins. The anthropologist Robert A. Voeks observed that it was the priesthood and more formally educated practitioners who preferred to distinguish the &quot;orixás&quot; from the saints, whereas less formally educated adherents tended not to.

====Relationships with the &quot;orixás&quot;====

In Candomblé, relationships are thought rooted in reciprocal obligations, and
Candomblecistas see the relationship between the &quot;orixás&quot; and humanity as being one of interdependence. Practitioners seek to build harmonious relationships with the &quot;orixás&quot;, thus securing their protection.

Candomblé teaches that everyone links to a particular &quot;orixá&quot;, one that influences that individual&#x27;s personality. This is their &quot;dono da cabeça&quot;: the owner or master of the person&#x27;s head. The gender of this tutelary &quot;orixá&quot; is not necessarily the same as their human&#x27;s. 

The identity of a person&#x27;s &quot;orixá&quot; can be ascertained through divination, and failing to know one&#x27;s &quot;orixá&quot; is sometimes interpreted as the cause of mental illness. Depending on the &quot;orixá&quot; in question, an initiate may choose to avoid or to engage in certain activities, such as avoiding specific foods or wearing specific colours. Some practitioners also believe in further &quot;orixá&quot; linked to an individual; a second is known as the &quot;juntó&quot;, while a third is called the &quot;adjuntó&quot;, the &quot;tojuntó&quot;, or the &quot;dijuntó&quot;. Some believe that a person can also have a fourth &quot;orixá&quot;, inherited from a deceased relative.

===&quot;Exus&quot; and &quot;caboclos&quot;===
Another spirit group in the Candomblé worldview are the &quot;exus&quot;, sometimes termed &quot;exuas&quot; when female, or &quot;exu-mirims&quot; when children. Deemed closer to humanity than the &quot;orixás&quot; and thus more accessible, the &quot;exus&quot; are often regarded as the &quot;slaves&quot; of the &quot;orixás&quot;. In common parlance they are often described as &quot;devils&quot;, although in Candomblé are not regarded as a force for absolute evil but rather thought capable of both good and bad acts. Practitioners believe that the &quot;exus&quot; can &quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot; the &quot;roads&quot; of fate in one&#x27;s life, bringing about both help and harm. Candomblé teaches that the &quot;exus&quot; can be induced to do a practitioner&#x27;s bidding, although need to be carefully controlled. The &quot;exus&quot; are recorded as having been part of Candomblé since at least the 1930s and probably arose earlier.

Also present in Candomblé are the &quot;caboclos&quot;, their name probably stemming from the Tupi language term &quot;kari&#x27;boka&quot; (&quot;deriving from the white&quot;). These spirits are typically those of indigenous Americans or of &quot;boiadeiros&quot; (&quot;cowboys&quot; or &quot;backwoodsmen&quot;), although in rarer cases &quot;caboclos&quot; are portrayed as being from the sea or from foreign countries. Almost exclusively male, the &quot;caboclos&quot; are believed to dwell in a forest land called Aruanda, and are characterised as smoking cigars and favoring beer.

The &quot;caboclos&quot; are particularly important in the Candomblé de Caboclo nation. This tradition has long been denigrated as inferior by other Candomblecistas, especially from the Nagô tradition. Many practitioners reject interaction with &quot;caboclos&quot;; this is the case for those who have tried to &quot;re-Africanize&quot; Candomblé since the late 20th century and who tend reject the &quot;caboclos&quot; as being of non-African derivation. As a result, some Candomblecistas have venerated &quot;orixás&quot; in the &quot;terreiro&quot; but only engaged with lesser spirits like the &quot;caboclos&quot; in the home. Where an individual has come to Candomblé via another Brazilian tradition like Umbanda, they are sometimes deemed to have brought &quot;caboclos&quot; or &quot;exus&quot; with them. In these instances, attempts are sometimes made to &quot;Africanize&quot; these spirits, ritually &quot;seating&quot; them in a material object, giving them an African-derived name, and then considering them a pledged slave of the &quot;orixás&quot;.

===Birth and the dead===

Candomblé adopts its cosmology largely from Yoruba traditional religion. The material world of humanity is called &quot;aiê&quot; (or &quot;aiye&quot;); the realm of the spirits is termed &quot;orun&quot;, and is divided into nine levels. Death is personified in the figure of Iku. A person&#x27;s inner head, in which their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot; is believed to reside, is called the &quot;ori&quot;.

Spirits of the dead are called &quot;eguns&quot;. The recently deceased are termed &quot;aparacá&quot;; after they have been &quot;educated&quot; by receiving sacrifices they become &quot;babá&quot;. After death, the &quot;egun&quot; can enter &quot;orun&quot;, although the level they reach depends on the spiritual growth they attained in life. Sometimes, &quot;eguns&quot; will seek to help the living but inadvertently harm them; given this potential, Candomblé stresses precautions in dealing with these entities. Contact with the &quot;egun&quot; is accompanied by rituals to neutralise their harmful power or pollution. The &quot;contra-egun&quot; is an armband made of plaited raffia which is sometimes worn to ward off dead spirits. Although thought possible, possession by &quot;eguns&quot; is considered rare, and is generally discouraged by Candomblé groups, who deem it spiritually polluting, a viewpoint that distinguishes Candomblé from Umbanda.

===&quot;Axé&quot;===
Candomblé teaches the existence of a force called &quot;ashe&quot; or &quot;axé&quot;, a central concept in Yoruba-derived traditions. The scholar Sheila Walker described &quot;axé&quot; as &quot;the spiritual force of the universe&quot;, and the anthropologist Joana Bahia called it &quot;sacred force.&quot; Jim Wafer termed it &quot;vital force&quot;, while Voeks favored &quot;vital energy&quot;. Scholar of religion Paul Johnson characterised it as &quot;a creative spiritual force with real material effects.&quot;

Practitioners believe &quot;axé&quot; can move, but can also concentrate in specific objects, such as leaves, roots, and specific body parts. Blood in particular is deemed to contain &quot;axé&quot; in its most concentrated form. Humans can accumulate &quot;axé&quot;, but also either lose or transfer it, with this force expressed through songs, prayers, and speech. Specific rituals and obligations are believed to maintain and enhance a person&#x27;s &quot;axé&quot;, while other ritual acts are designed to attract or share this force. &quot;Dendê&quot;, a sacred palm oil used to cook ritual meals, is considered to be a materialized form of &quot;axé&quot;.

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===
Candomblé generally has no fixed ethical precepts, although its teachings influence the lives of Candomblecistas. Rather than stressing a dichotomy between good and evil, emphasis is placed on achieving equilibrium between competing forces. Problems that arise in a person&#x27;s life are often interpreted as resulting from a disharmony in an individual&#x27;s relationship with their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;; harmony is ensured by following the &quot;orixá&quot;&#x27;s &quot;euó&quot; (taboos) regarding issues like food, drink, and colors. 

Male/female polarity is a recurring theme throughout Candomblé. Many roles within the religion are gendered. For instance, animal sacrifice and the shaving of an initiate&#x27;s head are usually reserved for male practitioners, while women are typically responsible for domestic duties in maintaining the ritual space. Such divisions mirror broader gender norms in Brazilian society. Restrictions are also placed on women while menstruating. However, women can still wield significant power as the heads of the &quot;terreiros&quot;; most &quot;terreiros&quot; in Bahia are led by women. Accordingly, it has been called a female-dominated religion, with scholarly debates taking place over whether it can be labelled matriarchal.

There is evidence that Candomblé is more accepting of sexual and gender non-conformity than mainstream Brazilian society. Many gay men are followers—in Rio de Janeiro many &quot;terreiros&quot; are integrated into the city&#x27;s gay social network—and a pervasive stereotype associates Candomblé with gay men. Homosexuals have described the religion as a more welcoming environment than Christianity, and have cited stories of relationships between male &quot;orixás&quot;, such as Oxôssi and Ossain, as affirming same-sex attraction. Some practitioners have involved themselves in political causes including environmentalism, indigenous rights, and the Black Power movement.

==Practices==

Candomblé is a practice-oriented religion; ritual correctness is considered more important than belief. Rituals often focus on pragmatic issues regarding prosperity, health, love, and fecundity. Those engaging in Candomblé include various initiates of varying degrees and non-initiates who may attend events and approach initiates seeking help with various problems. 

Candomblé is an initiatory religion, one which is organized around a structured hierarchy based on initiatory status. Knowledge about Candomblé&#x27;s beliefs and practices is referred to as the &quot;fundamentos&quot; (foundations&quot;), and is guarded by practitioners. It makes use of secrecy, and so Johnson has characterised it as a secret society. African-derived terms are used in ritual contexts; in general, words of Yoruba origin predominate in the Nagô nation, those from Ewe-Fon languages in Jeje nations, and words from the Bantu languages in the Angola nation. 

===Houses of Worship===

Candomblé places of worship are called &quot;terreiros&quot; (&quot;houses&quot;), or &quot;ilês&quot;. Each &quot;terreiro&quot; is independent and operates autonomously. They range in size from small houses to large compounds, and also vary in terms of their wealth and fame. A &quot;terreiro&quot;&#x27;s importance is generally regarded as being proportional to the number of initiates and clients that it has; the greater the number of initiates, the greater its own &quot;axé&quot;. Enmity often exists between &quot;terreiros&quot;, especially as they compete for members, with defection of individuals from one to another being common.

A &quot;terreiro&quot; may be concealed, so as not to attract unwanted attention. The interior consists of a series of rooms, some off-limits to non-initiates. They contain an altar to the deities, a space to perform ceremonies, and accommodation for the priests or priestesses. The &quot;bakisse&quot; is the &quot;room of the saints&quot;, a storeroom containing both ritual paraphernalia and the &quot;assentamentos&quot;, or seated objects, of the &quot;orixás&quot;, with most &quot;terreiros&quot; offering veneration to between twelve and twenty of these spirits. Another room, the &quot;roncó&quot; (&quot;retreat room&quot;) or &quot;camarinha&quot;, is used during initiations, while the &quot;barracão&quot; (&quot;big shed&quot;) is where public rituals, including divination, take place. &quot;Terreiros&quot; lacking a &quot;barracão&quot; may use a yard for public rites. The &quot;peji&quot;, or shrines to deities, will often be located around the perimeter of the &quot;barracão&quot;. 

The floor of the &quot;terreiro&quot; is deemed sacred, consecrated to the tutelary &quot;orixá&quot; of the house. The &quot;terreiro&quot; will often have a &quot;cumeeira&quot;, a central pole in the structure believed to link humanity&#x27;s world with that of the &quot;orixás&quot;. This stands above the &quot;entoto&quot; (&quot;foundation&quot;) of the &quot;terreiro&quot;, a space periodically &quot;fed&quot; with offerings. An outdoor enclosure may have a tree dedicated to Tempo, shrines to forest &quot;orixás&quot; like Oxossi and Ogun, and a &quot;balé&quot;, a place set aside for the souls of the dead. Plants used in rituals may also be grown in this outdoor area.

Public ceremonies take place at the &quot;terreiros&quot; where both initiates and non-initiates can attend to celebrate the &quot;orixás&quot;. Participants are expected to wear white; women wear skirts. Ceremonies often begin long after the advertised starting time. At these, food is offered to specific &quot;orixás&quot; while the rest is shared among participants, with the latter thereby gaining some of the &quot;axé&quot; of the &quot;orixás&quot;. These public rites are both preceded and succeeded by a range of private ritual acts.
Most of the rituals that take place at the &quot;terreiros&quot; are private and open only to initiates. Walker believed that it was these that represented &quot;the real core of the religious life of the Candomblé community.&quot;

====Priesthood and congregation====

The community of a &quot;terreiro&quot; is called an &quot;egbé&quot;. This is regarded as a &quot;family&quot;, its initiates being &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot; in the &quot;orixás&quot; (&quot;irmãos de Santo&quot; or &quot;irmãs de santo&quot;). Sexual or romantic relations between &quot;terreiro&quot; members is usually forbidden, although does happen. Being initiated into a &quot;terreito&quot; connects an individual to the lineage of that house; this lineage is linked to the &quot;axé&quot; of the &quot;terreiro&quot;. The founders of a &quot;terreiro&quot; are called &quot;essas&quot; and their names are evoked in the &quot;padê&quot;.

A priestess running a &quot;terreiro&quot; is a &quot;mâe de santo&quot; (mother of saints); a priest who does so is a &quot;pai de santo&quot; (father of saints). Specific terms also indicate which nation a person belongs to; in Nagô Candomblé, a male priest is called a &quot;babalorixá&quot;, a female priestess an &quot;iyalorixá&quot;. Serving as intermediaries between the &quot;orixás&quot; and humanity, this priesthood is responsible for all important functions, including educating novices, adjudicating disputes, and providing healing and divination services, these latter services often being their primary income. Not constrained by external religious authorities, these &quot;parents of saints&quot; often exert considerable control over their initiates. The latter are expected to submit to their authority, and to prostrate before them in an act called an &quot;iká&quot;; however, conflicts between these &quot;parents&quot; and their initiates are common. A &quot;terreiro&quot; will often disband when its chief priest or priestess dies. 

Assisting the &quot;mâe&quot; or &quot;pai de Santo&quot; is the &quot;iyakekerê&quot; (&quot;little mother&quot;) or &quot;mãe pequena&quot;, and the &quot;little father&quot;. Other roles in the &quot;terreiro&quot; include the &quot;iyabase&quot;, who prepares food for the &quot;orixás&quot;, and the &quot;alabê&quot; (musical director). Initiates, called the &quot;filhos&quot; (sons) and &quot;filhas de santo&quot; (daughters of the saints), assist as cooks, cleaners, and gardeners. Women initiates who do not enter trance but assist those who do are called &quot;ekedi&quot;; their male counterparts are termed &quot;ogan&quot;. The &quot;ogã&quot; are male members, often not initiated, whose role is largely honorific, consisting largely of contributing financially.

An individual who has taken steps toward initiation but not yet undergone this process is termed an &quot;abiã&quot; or &quot;abian&quot;.
An initiate of less than seven years is an &quot;iaô&quot; or &quot;iyawó&quot;; after seven years they may undergo the &quot;deká&quot; ceremony and thus be regarded as an &quot;ebomi&quot;, allowing them to open their own &quot;terreiro&quot;. Those who have performed seven years of initiatory rituals are called &quot;ebomi&quot; or &quot;ebame&quot;. At the end of the seven years, they &quot;receive the &quot;decá&quot;&quot; from their initiator, being given a tray of ritual objects; this enables them to go and form their own temple.
If another such &quot;terreiro&quot; splinters off, it is believed that the &quot;axé&quot; of the mother-&quot;terreiro&quot; transfers to the new one.

===Shrines and &quot;otás&quot;===

An altar to the &quot;orixás&quot; is called a &quot;peji&quot;. It contains an assemblage of objects termed the &quot;assentamento&quot; (&quot;seat&quot;) or &quot;assento&quot; of the &quot;orixá&quot;; this is regarded as the house of the &quot;orixá&quot;. This usually consists of various items placed within an enamel, earthenware, or wooden vessel, itself often wrapped in a cloth. The &quot;assentamento&quot; can be stored in the initiate&#x27;s home, or inside the &quot;terreiro&quot;&#x27;s &quot;bakisse&quot; room, which is only opened by the priestess or priest in charge. There, the &quot;assentamentos&quot; of the initiates may be arranged on a multi-level altar decorated with ribbons, colored lights, and flowers.

The key part of the &quot;assentamento&quot; is a sacred stone known as an &quot;otá&quot;. This &quot;otá&quot; possesses &quot;axé&quot;, and thus requires feeding. Each &quot;orixá&quot; is associated with a different kind of stone; those from the ocean or rivers are for instance linked to Oxum and Iemanjá, while those believed to have fallen from the sky are linked to Xangô. Practitioners are expected to find these stones, rather than buying them, after which they will be ritually consecrated, being washed, given offerings, and &quot;seated&quot; in their vessel. Alongside the &quot;otás&quot;, these spirit-vessels may contain &quot;ferramentos&quot;, or metal objects associated with specific &quot;orixás&quot;, cowrie shells, bracelets called &quot;idés&quot;, animal body parts, hair from the initiate who keeps it, statues of associated Roman Catholic saints, and a mix of water, honey, and herbal preparations. 

Objects used in ritual are often sanctified with a herbal infusion called &quot;amaci&quot;. Ritual objects are regarded as loci and accumulators of &quot;axé&quot;, although the supply of this force needs replenishing at various intervals. For this reason, they are given blood, to feed them with new &quot;axé&quot;. In Brazil, various stores specialise in paraphernalia required in Candomblé.

===Offerings and animal sacrifice===

Offerings to spirits are known as &quot;ebós&quot;, and can consist of food, drink, fowl, and money; when animal sacrifice is not involved, a food offering is termed a &quot;comida seca&quot;. These offerings are believed to generate &quot;axé&quot; which then gives an &quot;orixá&quot; the power to aid their worshippers. When a ceremony starts, practitioners typically provide a &quot;padé&quot;, or propitiatory offering, to the &quot;orixá&quot; Exu. 

As well as being offered in the &quot;terreiro&quot;, food is often placed at an appropriate landscape location; offerings to Oxum are for instance often deposited by a freshwater stream. Specific foodstuffs are associated with each &quot;orixá&quot;; a mix of okra with rice or manioc meal, known as &quot;amalá&quot;, is considered a favourite of Xangô, Obá, and Iansã. When placed in the &quot;terreiro&quot;, food is typically left in place for between one and three days, sufficient time for the &quot;orixá&quot; to consume the food&#x27;s essence. The ritual payment of money, often accompanying the sacrifices, is termed &quot;dinheiro do chão&quot; (&quot;money for the floor&quot;). As part of this, money is placed onto the floor and often splattered with blood, before being divided among the participants of the rite.

Candomblé entails animal sacrifice, which is called &quot;matanças&quot;. The individual performing the sacrifice is known as an &quot;axogun&quot; (or &quot;axogum&quot;) or sometimes as a &quot;faca&quot; (knife). Species typically used are chickens, guinea fowl, white doves, and goats. The animal will often have its neck cut with a knife, or in the case of birds, its head severed. After the animal is killed, its blood is spilled onto the altar; its organs are often removed and placed around the &quot;seat&quot; of the &quot;orixá&quot;. Following the sacrifice, is it common for divination to be performed to determine if the sacrifice has been accepted. Other body parts will then be consumed by the rite&#x27;s participants; the exception is if the sacrifice was for &quot;eguns&quot;, which is instead left to rot or placed in a river. Some of the food may then be taken away, to be left in the forest, thrown into a body of water, or placed at a crossroads; this is referred to as &quot;suspending a sacrifice&quot;. Outside Brazil, practitioners have faced challenges in performing animal sacrifice; in Germany, for instance, it is banned by law.

===Initiation===

Initiation is known as &quot;fazer cabeça&quot; (&quot;to make the head&quot;) or &quot;fazer o santo&quot; (&quot;making the saint&quot;). This is usually very expensive.
Initiates are known as &quot;filhos de santo&quot; (&quot;children of the saints&quot;). At their initiation, they are given a new name, the &quot;nome de santo&quot; (saint&#x27;s name), which usually indicates the identity of their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;. Many feel that an &quot;orixá&quot; has demanded their initiation, with it being their &quot;obrigação&quot; (&quot;duty&quot;). If a group of individuals are being initiated together, they are termed a &quot;barco&quot; (&quot;boat&quot;).

The length of the initiatory process varies between Candomblé houses but usually lasts from a few weeks to a few months. The initiate is first brought to the &quot;terreiro&quot;, where they are left for a period of relaxation, the &quot;descanso&quot;, so that they might become &quot;cool&quot;. They are dressed in white clothing, and they will be given a string of beads associated with their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;. The necklace is colored according to the latter; white for Oxalá, dark blue for Ogum, or red and white for Xangô, for instance. Washed and sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed animal, these beads are sometimes believed to protect the wearer from harm.

New initiates are secluded in a room in the &quot;terreiro&quot; called the &quot;roncô&quot;, where they sleep on a straw mat, eat only bland food, and are often forbidden to speak. During this period they are taught about their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;, such as its likes and dislikes and its associated drum rhythms and dances. The time spent in isolation varies, although three weeks is typical. They will be bathed in water mixed with herbs, before being taken to the altar room, where drumming and singing takes place. Animals are sacrificed, including a four-legged animal, and blood may be touched on the initiate&#x27;s body. 

The initiate&#x27;s head is then shaved and two cuts made into the apex of it with a razor, allowing the &quot;orixá&quot; entry into it; blood and herbs may be mixed into the wounds. A cone of wax, the &quot;adoxu&quot;, may be placed on the cut to stem the bleeding; the head will then be wrapped in cloth. Depending on the &quot;terreiro&quot;, cuts may also be made on the initiate&#x27;s tongue, back, upper arms, thighs, buttocks, and the soles of their feet. With the incisions made, the &quot;orixá&quot; is &quot;seated&quot; within the individual&#x27;s head during the &quot;assentar o santo&quot; ritual.

The new initiate may be presented to the rest of the community through the &quot;saida&quot; ceremony. Along with their white clothes, their body will often be covered in white spots. During this, they may be expected to give the name of the &quot;marca&quot; of their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;, which they are supposed to have discovered via a dream. In the &quot;panán&quot;, the initiate is symbolically re-taught mundane tasks, a ritual sometimes followed by an auction in which the initiate is symbolically sold to their spouse or a member of their family, a reference to the era of slavery. On the following Friday, they attend mass in a Roman Catholic church, and finally, a senior &quot;terreiro&quot; member will lead them back to their home. Becoming an initiate implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between the individual and the &quot;orixás&quot;, with the tutelary &quot;orixá&quot; now forever inhabiting that individual&#x27;s body.Over the course of the following year, the initiate may conduct further &quot;obligations&quot; to build their relationship with the &quot;orixá&quot;.

Candomblé includes additional, graded initiations, expected to take place one year, three years, and seven years after the original initiatory ceremony. Over the course of this they are expected to learn to receive all of their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;. In practice, many adherents cannot afford these ceremonies at the specified time and they instead take place years after.

===Possession===

Music and dance are fundamental elements of Candomblé. The drumming will often take place all night. In the Nagô tradition, three main types of drum are employed, the largest being the &quot;rum&quot;, the middle-sized being the &quot;rumpi&quot;, and the smallest being the &quot;lé&quot;. These drums are understood as living and need to be &quot;fed&quot;. The head drummer is the &quot;alabê&quot;. Many &quot;terreiros&quot; maintain that women should not be involved in this ritual drumming, although others reject this tradition. In some rituals, practitioners will drink a concoction containing jurema, a mildly hallucinogenic plant, sometimes mixed with the blood of sacrificed animals.

Although it is usually a dancer who becomes possessed, sometimes spectators will too. A possessed person is called a &quot;cavalo&quot; (horse); being possessed by the &quot;orixá&quot; is deemed a privilege. The state of vertigo signalling the onset of trance is known as &quot;barravento&quot;. As the trance begins, practitioners often experience a body spasm termed the &quot;arrepio&quot; (&quot;shiver&quot;). Practitioners believe that when an individual is possessed by a spirit, they have no control over the latter&#x27;s actions. A common way of referring to the possession is &quot;receber&quot; (&quot;to receive&quot;). As it entails being &quot;mounted&quot;, being possessed is regarded as being a symbolically female role, and some Candomblecistas believe that becoming a &quot;cavalo&quot; can turn a man homosexual. 

Practitioners may fully prostrate themselves before the possessed; this is termed a &quot;dobalé&quot;. After an individual becomes possessed, they may be led into an anteroom to be dressed in clothes associated with the possessing &quot;orixá&quot;; this usually includes brightly colored dresses, regardless of the gender of those involved. Those possessed by Ogun are for instance often given a metal helmet and axe, while those possessed by Oxum wear a crowd and carry a sword and the &quot;abebé&quot; fan.

The style of speech adopted by the possessed will be influenced by the type of spirit believed to be possessing them. Those possessed by an &quot;orixá&quot; may rarely if ever speak, refusing to eat, drink, or smoke to emphasise their aristocratic disposition. When they dance, it will often be stylized and controlled. When they do speak, the person possessed by an &quot;orixá&quot; may deliver predictions and prophecies. Those deemed to be possessed by &quot;caboclos&quot; will often smoke cigars, while those possessed by the &quot;erês&quot; child spirits may roll around the floor and squabble. Once the possessing spirit departs, it is expected that the possessed person will have no memory of it.

===Public festivals===

Although details of the liturgical calendar vary among &quot;terreiros&quot;, Candomblé features a yearly cycle of festivals or feasts to the &quot;orixás&quot;. These are sometimes private and sometimes open to the public. These are typically held on the Roman Catholic saint&#x27;s day associated with the saint linked to a particular &quot;orixá&quot;. The main festival season begins in September, with the feast of Oxala, and continues through to February, when the feast of Iemanjá takes place. In the Nagô nation, the Waters of Oxala ritual is performed at the start of the liturgical year; it involves bringing fresh water, sometimes from a well, to the terreiro to purify and replenish the assamentos.

In some cases, Candomblé festivals have become widely popular with the public, especially those of Oxala and Iemanjá. Hundreds of thousands of people congregate at the beach on Iemanjá&#x27;s Day (2 February), where they often load offerings to her onto boats, which then take them out into the water and cast them overboard. 

Among &quot;terreiros&quot; that hold festivals for the &quot;caboclos&quot;, this usually happens on 2 July, the day which marks Bahia&#x27;s independence from Portugal. Public festivals for &quot;exus&quot; are rarer. The tone of the event differs depending on which spirit category is being honoured; those for the &quot;orixás&quot; have more of a fixed structure and a greater formality, while those for the caboclos are more spontaneous and have greater interaction between the spirits and the human participants.

===Divination===

Initiates engage in divination, often as a key source of income.
The most common form of divination employed is the &quot;dilogun&quot; or &quot;jogo dos buzios&quot; (&quot;shell game&quot;), which is performed by both men and women. This entails throwing cowrie shells and drawing interpretation from their landing. 16 shells are commonly thrown, with a further four to confirm the answer provided by the first throwing. Each configuration of shells is associated with certain &quot;odu&quot;, or mythological stories, then interpreted as having pertinence for the client&#x27;s situation.

Another common divinatory practice involves slicing an onion in two and dropping the pieces to the ground, drawing conclusions from the face onto which they fall; alternatively a kola nut may be cut into quarters and read in the same way. Ifá is another Yoruba divinatory system, however by the start of the 21st century this was characterised as either extinct, or very rare in Brazil.

===Healing and amulet practices===
Healing forms an important part of Candomblé. Priests and priestesses may offer healing for conditions ranging from obesity and hair loss to pneumonia and cancer; in this capacity they are often called &quot;curandeiros&quot;. In the Candomblé worldview, a person&#x27;s problems may be caused by their disequilibrium with the spirit world, because they are lacking in &quot;axé&quot; and thus have an &quot;open&quot; body vulnerable to harmful influences, or because they are being punished by &quot;orixás&quot;. Alternatively, a person may be suffering because the spirit of a deceased person has attached itself to them, or because another human has wished them ill, either inadvertently, through the &quot;mau-olhado&quot; (evil eye), or through witchcraft and cursing.

People with a problem often approach a priest or priestess, who will then use divination to ascertain the cause and the remedy. A common first step in the healing process is the &quot;limpeza&quot;, or spiritual cleansing. This often entails an offering to a particular &quot;orixá&quot; or lesser spirit; a &quot;sacudimento&quot; (leaf whipping), whereby leaves are wiped over the patient&#x27;s body; or an &quot;abô&quot; (leaf bath), during which they are washed in water infused with various herbs and other ingredients. If the individual&#x27;s general health needs boosting, they may undergo the &quot;bori&quot; ceremony, in which food is placed on the patient&#x27;s head to feed their tutelary &quot;orixá&quot;.

If an &quot;egum&quot; is thought to be troubling the person, they will often undergo the &quot;cleansing of the body&quot; rite. In the &quot;troca da cobeça&quot; rite, the sickness is transferred to another, especially a bird that may be wiped over the patient before being killed. Healing may also necessitate the patient&#x27;s initiation into the religion. Staying healthy is then ensured by maintaining a state of equilibrium with the &quot;orixás&quot;, avoiding excess, and following lessons imparted in mythological tales. In addition to offering these treatments, a Candomblé healer may also recommend that the patient seek help from a medical professional. 

Candomblé healers are often well versed in herbalism, in which case they may be called a &quot;mâo de ofá&quot;. Herbs are deemed to contain &quot;axé&quot; which needs to be appropriately awakened: leaves should be fresh, not dried, and picked late at night or early in the morning to ensure maximum potency. If taken from the forest, permission should be sought from the overseeing &quot;orixá&quot; and offerings left, such as coins, honey, or tobacco; alternatively, healers often purchase them from the &quot;casas de folhas&quot; (&quot;houses of leaves&quot;) in markets. Leaves may then be rubbed directly on the patient or brewed into a tea or other medicinal concoction; practitioners may also produce &quot;pó&quot; (powder), which may have a variety of uses, from healing to harming or attracting someone&#x27;s romantic attention.

Candomblecistas often wear amulets. Common examples include horns or the &quot;figa&quot;, a fist with the thumb in inserted between the index and middle finger. A &quot;patuá&quot; consists of a small cloth pouch containing various objects, plant parts, and texts. Sprigs of the &quot;arruda&quot; or &quot;laranja-da-terra&quot; plants may also be carried to protect against the evil eye. Specific plants, associated with a particular &quot;orixá&quot;, are often kept by doorways to prevent the entry of negative forces.

===Funerals and the dead===

Following a senior initiate&#x27;s death, their &quot;terreiro&quot; will conduct the &quot;axexé&quot; rituals; these transform the deceased into an ancestral spirit of the &quot;terreiro&quot;&#x27;s own pantheon and ensures the dead person does not become a dangerous wandering spirit. Offerings, including sacrificed animals, are given to the deceased and to accompanying &quot;orixás&quot; during the &quot;axexé&quot;. A Roman Catholic mass will also be performed.

== History ==
===Origins===

Slavery was widespread in West Africa; most slaves were prisoners of war captured in conflicts with neighbouring groups, others were criminals or those in debt. Enslaved Africans first arrived in Brazil in the 1530s. These 16th-century arrivals came largely from the Guinea coast, but by the 17th century Angola and Congo populations had become dominant. Then, between 1775 and 1850, the majority of slaves were Yoruba and Dahomean, coming from the Gulf of Benin, largely in what is now Benin and Nigeria. After declaring itself independent from Portugal in 1822, Brazil abolished the slave trade in 1850, and then emancipated all slaves in 1888. In total, around four million Africans were transported to Brazil, more than to any other part of the Americas. In Brazil, they were concentrated predominantly in Bahia.

On arriving in Brazil, slaves were divided into &quot;nations&quot; based largely on their port of embarkation. This meant that Africans of different cultural backgrounds, regions, and religions were included together under a unifying term; those from the Bight of Benin were for instance called &quot;Nagô&quot;. As the Yoruba and Dahomean people made up the last wave of slaves, they became numerically dominant among Afro-Brazilians and their traditional cosmology became ascendant over that of longer established communities. The process of enslavement broke up the traditional links between African deities and specific regions, while also mixing deities from different peoples into a singular pantheon. Of the thousands of &quot;orishas&quot; venerated in West Africa, far fewer continued to be worshipped in Brazil; &quot;orisha&quot; associated with agriculture were abandoned, for instance, as slaves had little reason to protect the harvests of slave-owners. By the 18th century, accounts of African-derived rituals performed in Brazil were common, at which point they were referred to generically as &quot;calundu&quot;, a term of Bantu origin. 

In colonial Brazil, enslaved Africans were expected to give up their traditional religions for Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic nature of Brazilian colonial society, which allowed for a cult of saints, may have permitted greater leeway for the survival of traditional African religions than were available in Protestant-dominant areas of the Americas. Many of the slaves learned to classify their &quot;orixás&quot; in relation to the Roman Catholic saints and the calendar of saints&#x27; days. There is no evidence that the slaves simply used the cult of saints to conceal &quot;orixá&quot; worship, but rather that devotees understood the two pantheons as comprising similar figures with similar abilities to fix certain problems. Some in the Roman Catholic Church saw the syncretisation as a positive step in the process of converting the Africans to Christianity. The Christian teaching provided to enslaved Africans was often rudimentary. Slave owners often believed that allowing the slaves to keep their traditional customs would expend energies that might otherwise be directed toward rebellion.

===Formation and early history===

Although African religions had been present in Brazil since the 16th century, the &quot;organized, structured liturgy and community of practice called Candomblé&quot; only arose later. The earliest &quot;terreiros&quot; appeared in Bahia in the early 19th century. According to what the scholar Stefania Capone called &quot;the founding myth of Candomblé&quot;, the first &quot;terreiro&quot; was the Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká (also known as the Casa Branca or Engenho Velho), founded in Salvador in 1830, and from which the Nagô tradition descends. 

Various emancipated Yoruba began trading between Brazil and West Africa, and a significant role in the creation of Candomblé were several African freemen who were affluent and sent their children to be educated in Lagos. 

Brazil&#x27;s republican Constitution of 1891 enshrined freedom of religion. However, Afro-Brazilian religious traditions continued to face legal issues; the Penal Code of 1890 included prohibitions on Spiritism, talismans, and much herbal medicine, impacting Candomblé. The authorities continued to shut down &quot;terreiros&quot;, claiming they were a threat to public health. The late 19th century saw the first &quot;terreiros&quot; open in Rio de Janeiro, a city then seeing a rapid expansion in its population. The period also saw various upper-class white Brazilians seeking out Candomblé.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Candomblé became increasingly public in the 1930s, partly because Brazilians were increasingly encouraged to perceive themselves as part of a multi-racial, mixed society in the midst of President Getúlio Vargas&#x27; Estado Novo project. Vargas&#x27; Law Decree 1202 recognized the legitimacy of &quot;terreiros&quot;, while the Penal Code of 1940 offered them additional protections. The 1930s saw a proliferation of academic studies on Candomblé by scholars like Raimundo Nina Rodrigues, Edison Carneiro, and Ruth Landes, most focusing on the Nagô tradition. The growing literature, both scholarly and popular, helped document Candomblé while contributing to its greater standardisation. 

The religion spread during the 20th century. Growing Afro-Brazilian migration to São Paulo brought the rapid rise of Candomblé there; from virtually no &quot;terreiros&quot; until the 1960s, it had over 4000 by the century&#x27;s end. Some practitioners became increasingly well known; the priestess Mãe Menininha do Gantois became nationally recognised. Various organizations emerged to represent the &quot;terreiros&quot;, notably the Bahian Federation of the Afro-Brazilian Cults, the National Institute and Supreme Sacerdotal Organ of Afro-Brazilian Culture and Tradition, and the Conference of the Tradition and Culture of the Orixás. Candomblé federations emerged in most Brazilian states, representing practitioners in their dealings with the government and society more broadly. 

Growing links were also established with other African diasporic and West African religions. Brazilians took part in the first International Congress of Orisha Tradition and Culture in Ifẹ, Nigeria in 1981; the second was held in Salvador in 1983. The late 20th century saw some practitioners—most famously Mãe Stella Azevedo—try to &quot;re-Africanise&quot; Candomblé by removing Roman Catholic elements. This was an effort to attract prestige, and proved popular among white middle-class practitioners who had little standing with the predominantly Afro-Brazilian Bahian Candomblé establishment. Other practitioners rejected this approach, deeming Roman Catholic influences an important part of Candomblé. 

Candomblé was increasingly respectable by the late 20th century, a situation fuelled by well-educated Afro-Brazilians embracing their cultural heritage, by increased Brazilian trade with West Africa, and by the growing number of intellectual and white initiates. By the early 21st century, tourist literature increasingly portrayed Candomblé as an intrinsic part of Brazilian culture; Varig Airlines used the tagline &quot;Fly with &quot;Axé&quot;.&quot; Conversely, the 2000s saw growing Evangelical Protestant opposition, including physical attacks on practitioners and &quot;terreiros&quot;, to which Candomblecistas responded with protest marches.

==Demographics==

One census report indicated that around 1.3 percent of Brazil&#x27;s population identified as Candomblé followers. This likely reflects only the number of initiates, with a larger body of non-initiates sometimes attending ceremonies or consulting initiates for healing and other services. 

Candomblé is centred largely in and around the city of Salvador, sometimes referred to as &quot;Black Rome,&quot; and regarded by some followers as a holy city. A 1997 census by the Bahian Federation of Afro-Brazilian Religions recorded 1,144 &quot;terreiros&quot; in Salvador. Practitioners in Rio de Janeiro and Sâo Paulo often regard Bahian &quot;terreiros&quot; as being more authentic. Candomblé has also spread to other parts of South America like Argentina and Uruguay, as well as to European countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy.

In Brazil, Candomblé is a largely urban phenomenon, generally found among the poor, with most followers being black women. Membership is more diverse in southern Brazil, where there are large numbers of white and middle-class followers; there are also followers among Brazil&#x27;s Japanese minority. Women predominate in the Ketu nation, although men dominate the Angola and Jeje nations. 

Many Candomblecistas have a family link to the tradition, with their parents or other relatives being initiates. Others convert to the movement without such connections, sometimes having already explored Pentecostalism, Spiritism, or Umbanda; some Umbandistas feel that they can go &quot;deeper&quot; by moving towards Candomblé. Many describe having been ill or plagued with misfortune prior to being initiated into Candomblé, having determined through divination that their ailments would cease if they did so. It has been argued that Candomblé offers a sense of empowerment to the socially marginalised, and has appeal for those who identify strongly with an African heritage; some black people in Germany, for instance, have been attracted to it because they feel it is more authentically African than Christianity or Islam.

==Reception and influence==
Candomblé has been described as a much maligned religion. Practitioners have often encountered intolerance and religious discrimination: their religion is given the negative label &quot;macumba&quot;, &quot;terreiro&quot; leaders are often stereotyped as greedy and conniving, and &quot;terreiros&quot; have been attacked. More extreme hostile views of Candomblé have regarded it as devil worship, while milder critical views see it as superstition that attracts the simple-minded and desperate. Brazil&#x27;s Roman Catholics have mixed opinions of Candomblé and the attendance of its practitioners at mass, while Evangelical and Pentecostal groups more uniformly target Candomblecistas as part of their &quot;spiritual war&quot; against Satan. 

Candomblé has elsewhere been seen as &quot;a treasured symbol of Brazilian cultural identity and an icon of African Diaspora culture and politics&quot;. Various academics have sought to portray it in the best light possible to counter racist stereotypes about Afro-Brazilians. Academic studies have in turn influenced the way that the religion is practiced, helping to establish &quot;correct practice&quot; among divergent groups; many &quot;terreiros&quot; own copies of academic studies about the religion, sometimes to convey an image of authority.

Since the 1960s, Candomblé has featured in films such as &quot;The Given Word&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Amulet of Ogum&quot; (1974), as well as documentaries like Geraldo Sarno&#x27;s &quot;Iaô&quot; (1974). It has also influenced novelists, appearing in works by writers like Jorge Amado, and Toni Morrison. References to the religion also appeared in Brazilian popular music. For instance, Maria Bethânia and Gal Costa&#x27;s song &quot;Prayer to Mãe Menininha&quot; made it into the country&#x27;s chart. Objects associated with Candomblé first went on display in police museums but as the religion gained greater acceptance such material also begun to appear in museums devoted to folklore and Afro-Brazilian culture. From the 1990s, practitioners began establishing their own museums within their &quot;terreiros&quot;. For instance, the bedroom of Mãe Menininha do Gantois, located in her Bahia &quot;terreiro&quot;, was converted into a memorial in 1992 and then formally recognised as a heritage site in 2002.

<text>The vulcanoids are a hypothetical population of asteroids that orbit the Sun in a dynamically stable zone inside the orbit of the planet Mercury. They are named after the hypothetical planet Vulcan, which was proposed on the basis of irregularities in Mercury&#x27;s orbit that were later found to be explained by general relativity. So far, no vulcanoids have been discovered, and it is not yet clear whether any exist.

If they do exist, the vulcanoids could easily evade detection because they would be very small and near the bright glare of the Sun. Due to their proximity to the Sun, searches from the ground can only be carried out during twilight or solar eclipses. Any vulcanoids must be between about and in diameter and are probably located in nearly circular orbits near the outer edge of the gravitationally stable zone between the Sun and Mercury. These should be distinguished from Atira asteroids, which may have perihelia within the orbit of Mercury, but whose aphelia extends as far as the orbits of Venus or within Earth&#x27;s orbital path. Because they cross the orbit of Mercury, these bodies are not classed as vulcanoids.

The vulcanoids, should they be found, may provide scientists with material from the first period of planet formation, as well as insights into the conditions prevalent in the early Solar System. Although every other gravitationally stable region in the Solar System has been found to contain objects, non-gravitational forces (such as the Yarkovsky effect) or the influence of a migrating planet in the early stages of the Solar System&#x27;s development may have depleted this area of any asteroids that may have been there.

==History and observation==

Celestial bodies interior to the orbit of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing in front of the Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury&#x27;s orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet&#x27;s perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within the orbit of Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier&#x27;s proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury&#x27;s orbit was explained by Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.

Vulcanoids, should they exist, would be difficult to detect due to the strong glare of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.

In 1998, astronomers analysed data from the SOHO spacecraft&#x27;s LASCO instrument, which is a set of three coronagraphs. The data taken between January and May of that year did not show any vulcanoids brighter than magnitude 7. This corresponds to a diameter of about , assuming the asteroids have an albedo similar to that of Mercury. In particular, a large planetoid at a distance of 0.18 AU, predicted by the theory of scale relativity, was ruled out.

Later attempts to detect the vulcanoids involved taking astronomical equipment above the interference of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, to heights where the twilight sky is darker and clearer than on the ground. In 2000, planetary scientist Alan Stern performed surveys of the vulcanoid zone using a Lockheed U-2 spy plane. The flights were conducted at a height of during twilight. In 2002, he and Dan Durda performed similar observations on an F-18 fighter jet. They made three flights over the Mojave Desert at an altitude of and made observations with the Southwest Universal Imaging System—Airborne (SWUIS-A).

Even at these heights the atmosphere is still present and can interfere with searches for vulcanoids. In 2004, a sub-orbital spaceflight was attempted in order to get a camera above Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A Black Brant rocket was launched from White Sands, New Mexico, on January 16, carrying a powerful camera named VulCam, on a ten-minute flight. This flight reached an altitude of and took over 50,000 images. None of the images revealed any vulcanoids, but there were technical problems.

Searches of NASA&#x27;s two STEREO spacecraft data have failed to detect any vulcanoid asteroids. It is doubtful that there are any vulcanoids larger than in diameter.

The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; space probe took a few images of the outer regions of the vulcanoid zone; however, its opportunities were limited because its instruments had to be pointed away from the Sun at all times to avoid damage. Before its demise in 2015, however, the craft failed to produce substantial evidence on vulcanoids.

On August 13, 2021, an asteroid, , was discovered with a perihelion well within the orbit of Mercury. At its minimum distance to the Sun of 0.1331 AU, it comes more than twice as close to the Sun as Mercury&#x27;s perihelion at 0.307499 AU. This puts its nearest approach well within the hypothesized Vulcanoid Zone.

==Orbit==

A vulcanoid is an asteroid in a stable orbit with a semi-major axis less than that of Mercury (i.e. 0.387 AU). This does not include objects like sungrazing comets, which, although they have perihelia inside the orbit of Mercury, have far greater semi-major axes.

The vulcanoids are thought to exist in a gravitationally stable band inside the orbit of Mercury, at distances of 0.06–0.21 AU from the Sun. All other similarly stable regions in the Solar System have been found to contain objects, although non-gravitational forces such as radiation pressure, Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect may have depleted the vulcanoid area of its original contents. There may be no more than 300–900 vulcanoids larger than in radius remaining, if any. A 2020 study found that the Yarkovsky–O&#x27;Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect is strong enough to destroy hypothetical vulcanoids as large as 100 km in radius on timescales far smaller than the age of the Solar System; would-be vulcanoid asteroids were found to be steadily spun up by the YORP effect until they rotationally fission into smaller bodies, which occurs repeatedly until the debris is small enough to be pushed out of the vulcanoid region by the Yarkovsky effect; this would explain why no vulcanoids have been observed. The gravitational stability of the vulcanoid zone is due in part to the fact that there is only one neighbouring planet. In that respect it can be compared to the Kuiper belt.

The outer edge of the vulcanoid zone is approximately 0.21 AU from the Sun. Objects more distant than this are unstable due to interactions with Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. (Some definitions would nonetheless include such unstable objects as vulcanoids as long as their orbits lie completely interior to that of Mercury.) The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06 AU are particularly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09 AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000 K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to become the limiting factor in their lifetime.

The maximum possible volume of the vulcanoid zone is very small compared to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, tending to lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near the outer edge of the vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are unlikely to have inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury&#x27;s Lagrange points, are also possible.

==Physical characteristics==

Any vulcanoids that exist must be relatively small. Previous searches, particularly from the STEREO spacecraft, rule out asteroids larger than in diameter. The minimum size is about ; particles smaller than 0.2 μm are strongly repulsed by radiation pressure, and objects smaller than 70 m would be drawn into the Sun by Poynting–Robertson drag. Between these upper and lower limits, a population of asteroids between and in diameter is thought to be possible. They would be almost hot enough to glow red hot.
It is thought that the vulcanoids would be very rich in elements with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material left over from the earliest stages of the Solar System&#x27;s formation.

There is evidence that Mercury was struck by a large object relatively late in its development, a collision which stripped away much of Mercury&#x27;s crust and mantle, and explaining the thinness of Mercury&#x27;s mantle compared to the mantles of the other terrestrial planets. If such an impact occurred, much of the resulting debris might still be orbiting the Sun in the vulcanoid zone.

==Significance==

Vulcanoids, being an entirely new class of celestial bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering whether or not they exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet&#x27;s surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.

<text>Motor Booty Affair is the seventh album by funk band Parliament, released in 1978. It contains two of the group&#x27;s most popular tracks, &quot;Rumpofsteelskin&quot; and &quot;Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)&quot;, which went to number one on the Billboard Soul Singles chart.

Artist Overton Loyd created the art for &quot;Motor Booty Affair&quot;. The main release consisted of a gate-fold album cover featuring a pop-up rendition of the city of Atlantis, with Loyd&#x27;s artwork on the front and back covers. His illustrations included cartoon portraits of some of the &quot;characters&quot; mentioned in the songs on the album, including &quot;Mr. Wiggles&quot;. It also included cardboard cutout figures featuring Loyd&#x27;s cartoon illustrations of most of the characters mentioned in the songs. There was a picture disk, with Loyd&#x27;s illustration printed directly on the vinyl LP. The album was Parliament&#x27;s fifth consecutive gold album (500,000 copies sold).

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Bay State Banner&quot; wrote that the album &quot;had bop and free jazz, bass playing of remarkable range and liberty, courageous and engaging piano, wisecracking but unpredictable vocals, lyrics that said it all in slang so right you felt you&#x27;d been using it all your life instead of hearing it for the first time.&quot;

<doc id="482589" wikidata="Q815241" url="?curid=482589" title="Runestone">
<text>A runestone is typically a raised stone with a runic inscription, but the term can also be applied to inscriptions on boulders and on bedrock. The tradition of erecting runestones as a memorial to dead men began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, but the majority of the extant runestones date from the late Viking Age. While most of these are located in Scandinavia, particularly Sweden, there are also scattered runestones in locations that were visited by Norsemen. Runestones were usually brightly coloured when erected, though this is no longer evident as the colour has worn off.

==History==

The tradition of raising stones that had runic inscriptions first appeared in the 4th and 5th century, in Norway and Sweden, and these early runestones were usually placed next to graves, though their precise function as commemorative monuments has been questioned. The earliest Danish runestones appeared in the 8th and 9th centuries, and there are about 50 runestones from the Migration Period in Scandinavia. Most runestones were erected during the period 950–1100 CE, and then they were mostly raised in Sweden, and to a lesser degree in Denmark and Norway.

The tradition is mentioned in both &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and &quot;Hávamál&quot;:
What may have increased the spread of runestones was an event in Denmark in the 960s. King Harald Bluetooth had just been baptised and in order to mark the arrival of a new order and a new age, he commanded the construction of a runestone. The inscription reads

The runestone has three sides of which two are decorated with images. On one side, there is an animal that is the prototype of the runic animals that would be commonly engraved on runestones, and on another side there is Denmark&#x27;s oldest depiction of Jesus. Shortly after this stone had been made, something happened in Scandinavia&#x27;s runic tradition. Scores of chieftains and powerful Norse clans consciously tried to imitate King Harald, and from Denmark a runestone wave spread northwards through Sweden. In most districts, the fad died out after a generation, but, in the central Swedish provinces of Uppland and Södermanland, the fashion lasted into the 12th century.

==Distribution==

There are about 3,000 runestones among the about 6,000 runic inscriptions in Scandinavia. There are also runestones in other parts of the world as the tradition of raising runestones followed the Norsemen wherever they went, from the Isle of Man (Manx Runestones) in the west to the Black Sea in the east (Berezan&#x27; Runestone), and from Jämtland in the north to Schleswig in the south.

The runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none. Sweden has between 1,700 and 2,500 depending on definition. The Swedish district of Uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1,196 inscriptions in stone, whereas Södermanland is second with 391.

Outside of Scandinavia, the Isle of Man stands out with its 30 runestones from the 9th century and early 11th century. Scattered runestones have also been found in England, Ireland, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. With the exception of the runestone on Berezan&#x27;, there are no runestones in Eastern Europe, which probably is due to a lack of available stones and the fact that the local population probably did not treat the foreigners&#x27; stones with much respect.

Runestones were placed on selected spots in the landscape, such as assembly locations, roads, bridge constructions, and fords. In medieval churches, there are often runestones that have been inserted as construction material, and it is debated whether they were originally part of the church location or had been moved there. In southern Scania, runestones can be tied to large estates that also had churches constructed on their land. In the Mälaren Valley, the runestones appear to be placed so that they mark essential parts of the domains of an estate, such as courtyard, grave field, and borders to neighbouring estates. Runestones usually appear as single monuments and more rarely as pairs. In some cases, such as the Hunnestad Monument, they are part of larger monuments together with other raised stones.

Although scholars know where 95% of all runestones were discovered, only about 40% were discovered in their original location. The remainder have been found in churches, roads, bridges, graves, farms, and water routes. On the other hand, scholars agree that the stones were not moved very far from their original sites.

===Effect of religion===
In many districts, 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity, but, in Uppland, which has the highest concentration of runic inscriptions in the world, about 70% of the 1,196 stone inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, and only a few runestones are not Christian.

Scholars have suggested that the reason why so many Christian runestones were raised in Uppland is that the district was the focal point in the conflict between Norse paganism and the newly Christianized King of Sweden. It is possible that the chieftains tried to demonstrate their allegiance to the king and to display their Christian faith to the world and to God by adding Christian crosses and prayers on their runestones. What speaks against this theory is the fact that Norway, Denmark, and Götaland did not have any corresponding development in the runestone tradition. Moreover, not a single runestone declares that there was any relationship towards the king. Additionally, the runestones appear to show that the conversion was a rather peaceful process.

According to another theory, it was a social fashion that was popular among certain clans, but not among all of them. Once some clans in southern Uppland had begun to raise runestones, neighbouring clans emulated them. However, in parts where these clans were less influential, the runestone raising did not reach the same popularity. Several scholars have pointed out the long Viking expeditions and the considerable amassment of wealth in the district. At this time, Swedish chieftains near Stockholm had created considerable fortunes through trade and pillaging both in the East and in the West. They had seen the Danish Jelling stones or they had been inspired by Irish high crosses and other monuments.

The runestones show the different ways in which Christianity changed Norse society, and one of the greatest changes involved no longer burying the deceased on the clan&#x27;s grave field among his ancestors. Instead, he was buried in the cemetery of the church, while the runestone would serve as a memorial at the homestead, but for certain families, there was less change as they had churches built adjoining the family grave field.

==Inscriptions==

The main purpose of a runestone was to mark territory, to explain inheritance, to boast about constructions, to bring glory to dead kinsmen and to tell of important events. In some parts of Uppland, the runestones also appear to have functioned as social and economical markers.

Virtually all the runestones from the late Viking Age make use of the same formula. The text tells in memory of whom the runestone is raised, who raised it, and often how the deceased and the one who raised the runestone are related to each other. Also, the inscription can tell the social status of the dead person, possible foreign voyage, place of death, and also a prayer, as in the following example, the Lingsberg Runestone U 241:

===Stone raisers===
Most runestones were raised by men and only one runestone in eight is raised by a single woman, while at least 10% are raised by a woman together with several men. It is common that the runestones were raised by sons and widows of the deceased, but they could also be raised by sisters and brothers. It is almost only in Uppland, Södermanland, and Öland that women raised runestones together with male relatives. It is not known why many people such as sisters, brothers, uncles, parents, housecarls, and business partners can be enumerated on runestones, but it is possible that it is because they are part of the inheritors.

===Those commemorated===

A vast majority, 94%, are raised in memory of men, but, contrary to common perception, the vast majority of the runestones are raised in memory of people who died at home. The most famous runestones and those that people tend to think of are those that tell of foreign voyages, but they comprise only c. 10% of all runestones, and they were raised in usually memory of those not having returned from Viking expeditions and not as tributes to those having returned. These runestones contain roughly the same message as the majority of the runestones, which is that people wanted to commemorate one or several dead kinsmen.

====Expeditions in the East====
The first man who scholars know fell on the eastern route was the East Geat Eyvindr whose fate is mentioned on the 9th century Kälvesten Runestone. The epitaph reads:

It is unfortunate for historians that the stones rarely reveal where the men died. On the Smula Runestone in Västergötland, we are informed only that they died during a war campaign in the East: &quot;Gulli/Kolli raised this stone in memory of his wife&#x27;s brothers Ásbjôrn and Juli, very good valiant men. And they died in the east in the retinue&quot;. Another runemaster in the same province laconically states on the Dalum Runestone: &quot;Tóki and his brothers raised this stone in memory of their brothers. One died in the west, another in the east&quot;.

The country that is mentioned on the most runestones is the Byzantine Empire, which at the time comprised most of Asia Minor and the Balkans, as well as a part of Southern Italy. If a man died in the Byzantine Empire, no matter how he had died or in which province, the event was noted as &quot;he died in Greece&quot;. Sometimes an exception could be made for Southern Italy, which was known as the land of the Lombards, such as Inga&#x27;s Óleifr who, it is presumed, was a member of the Varangian Guard, and about whom the Djulafors Runestone in Södermanland says: &quot;Inga raised this stone in memory of Óleifr, her ... He ploughed his stern to the east, and met his end in the land of the Lombards.&quot;

Other Norsemen died in Gardariki (Russia and Ukraine) such as Sigviðr on the Esta Runestone who his son Ingifastr reported had fled in Novgorod (&quot;Holmgarðr&quot;): &quot;He fell in Holmgarðr, the ship&#x27;s leader with the seamen.&quot; There were others who died not as far from home and it appears that there were close contacts with Estonia due to many personal names such as &quot;Æistfari&quot; (&quot;traveller to Estonia&quot;), &quot;Æistulfr&quot; (&quot;Wolf of Estonians&quot;) and Æistr (&quot;Estonian&quot;). One of the runestones that report of deaths in Estonia is the Ängby Runestone which tells that a Björn had died in Vironia (&quot;Virland&quot;).

There were many ways to die as reported by the runestones. The Åda Runestone reports that Bergviðr drowned during a voyage to Livonia, and the Sjonhem Runestone tells that the Gotlander Hróðfúss was killed in a treacherous way by what was probably a people in the Balkans. The most famous runestones that tell of eastern voyages are the Ingvar Runestones which tell of Ingvar the Far-Travelled&#x27;s expedition to Serkland, i.e., the Muslim world. It ended in tragedy as none of the more than 25 runestones that were raised in its memory tells of any survivor.

====Expeditions in the West====
Other Vikings travelled westwards. The Anglo-Saxon rulers paid large sums, Danegelds, to Vikings, who mostly came from Denmark and who arrived to the English shores during the 990s and the first decades of the 11th century. What may be part of a Danegeld has been found submerged in a creek in Södra Betby in Södermanland, Sweden. At the location, there is also a runestone with the text: &quot;[...] raise the stone in memory of Jôrundr, his son, who was in the west with Ulfr, Hákon&#x27;s son.&quot; It is not unlikely that the voyage westwards is connected with the English silver treasure. Other runestones are more explicit with the Danegelds. Ulf of Borresta who lived in Vallentuna travelled westwards several times, as reported on the Yttergärde Runestone:
Tosti may have been the Swedish chieftain Skoglar Tosti who is otherwise only mentioned by Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and who Snorri reports to have been a &quot;great warrior&quot; who &quot;was out for long periods of time on war expeditions&quot;. Þorketill was Thorkell the Tall, one of the most famous Viking chieftains, and who often stayed in England. Knútr is no one else but Canute the Great, who became king of England in 1016.

Canute sent home most of the Vikings who had helped him conquer England, but he kept a strong bodyguard, the Þingalið. It was considered to be a great honour to be part of this force, and, on the Häggeby Runestone in Uppland, it is reported that Geiri &quot;sat in the Assembly&#x27;s retinue in the west,&quot; and the Landeryd Runestone mentions Þjalfi, &quot;who was with Knútr&quot;. Some Swedish Vikings wanted nothing else but to travel with Danes such as Thorkell and Canute the Great, but they did not make it to their destinations. Sveinn, who came from Husby-Sjuhundra in Uppland, died when he was half-way to England, as explained on the runestone that was raised in his memory: &quot;He died in Jútland. He meant to travel to England&quot;. Other Vikings, such as Guðvér did not only attack England, but also Saxony, as reported by the Grinda Runestone in Södermanland:

There are in total about 30 runestones that tell of people who went to England, see the England Runestones. Some of them are very laconic and only tell that the Viking was buried in London, or in Bath, Somerset.
===Conversion===
Swedish men who travelled to Denmark, England, or Saxony and the Byzantine Empire played an important part in the introduction of Christianity in Sweden, and two runestones tell of men baptized in Denmark, such as the runestone in Amnö, which says &quot;He died in christening robes in Denmark.&quot; A similar message is given on another runestone in Vallentuna near Stockholm that tells that two sons waited until they were on their death beds before they converted: &quot;They died in (their) christening robes.&quot; Christening robes or baptismal clothes, &quot;hvitavaðir&quot;, were given to pagan Scandinavians when they were baptized, and in Uppland there are at least seven stones that tell of convertees having died in such robes.

The language used by the missionaries appears on several runestones, and they suggest that the missionaries used a rather uniform language when they preached. The expression &quot;light and paradise&quot; is presented on three runestones, of which two are located in Uppland and a third on the Danish island Bornholm. The runestone U 160 in Risbyle says &quot;May God and God&#x27;s mother help his spirit and soul; grant him light and paradise.&quot; and the Bornholm runestone also appeals to Saint Michael: &quot;May Christ and Saint Michael help the souls of Auðbjôrn and Gunnhildr into light and paradise.&quot;

Christian terminology was superimposed on the earlier pagan, and so &quot;Paradise&quot; substituted &quot;Valhalla&quot;, invocations to Thor and magic charms were replaced with Saint Michael, Christ, God, and the Mother of God. Saint Michael, who was the leader of the army of Heaven, subsumed Odin&#x27;s role as the psychopomp, and led the dead Christians to &quot;light and paradise&quot;. There are invocations to Saint Michael on one runestone in Uppland, one on Gotland, on three on Bornholm and on one on Lolland.

There is also the Bogesund runestone that testifies to the change that people were no longer buried at the family&#x27;s grave field: &quot;He died in Eikrey(?). He is buried in the churchyard.&quot;

===Other types of runestones===
Another interesting class of runestone is rune-stone-as-self promotion. Bragging was a virtue in Norse society, a habit in which the heroes of sagas often indulged, and is exemplified in runestones of the time. Hundreds of people had stones carved with the purpose of advertising their own achievements or positive traits. A few examples will suffice:
* U 1011: &quot;Vigmund had this stone carved in memory of himself, the cleverest of men. May God help the soul of Vigmund, the ship captain. Vigmund and Åfrid carved this memorial while he lived.&quot;
* Frösö Runestone: &quot;Östman Gudfast&#x27;s son made the bridge, and he Christianized Jämtland&quot;
* Dr 212: &quot;Eskill Skulkason had this stone raised to himself. Ever will stand this memorial that Eskill made;&quot;
* U 164: &quot;Jarlabanki had this stone put up in his own lifetime. And he made this causeway for his soul&#x27;s sake. And he owned the whole of Täby by himself. May God help his soul.&quot;

Other runestones, as evidenced in two of the previous three inscriptions, memorialize the pious acts of relatively new Christians. In these, we can see the kinds of good works people who could afford to commission runestones undertook. Other inscriptions hint at religious beliefs. For example, one reads:
* U 160: &quot;Ulvshattil and Gye and Une ordered this stone erected in memory of Ulv, their good father. He lived in Skolhamra. God and God&#x27;s Mother save his spirit and soul, endow him with light and paradise.&quot;

Although most runestones were set up to perpetuate the memories of men, many speak of women, often represented as conscientious landowners and pious Christians:
* Sö 101: &quot;Sigrid, Alrik&#x27;s mother, Orm&#x27;s daughter made this bridge for her husband Holmgers, father of Sigoerd, for his soul&quot;
as important members of extended families:
* Br Olsen;215: &quot;Mael-Lomchon and the daughter of Dubh-Gael, whom Adils had to wife, raised this cross in memory of Mael-Muire, his fostermother. It is better to leave a good fosterson than a bad son&quot;

and as much-missed loved ones:
* N 68: &quot;Gunnor, Thythrik&#x27;s daughter, made a bridge in memory of her daughter Astrid. She was the most skilful girl in Hadeland.&quot;

===As sources===
The only existing Scandinavian texts dating to the period before 1050 (besides a few finds of inscriptions on coins) are found amongst the runic inscriptions, some of which were scratched onto pieces of wood or metal spearheads, but for the most part they have been found on actual stones. In addition, the runestones usually remain in their original form and at their original locations, and so their importance as historical sources cannot be overstated.

The inscriptions seldom provide solid historical evidence of events and identifiable people but instead offer insight into the development of language and poetry, kinship, and habits of name-giving, settlement, depictions from Norse paganism, place-names and communications, Viking as well as trading expeditions, and, not least, the spread of Christianity. Though the stones offer Scandinavian historians their main resource of information concerning early Scandinavian society, not much can be learned by studying the stones individually. The wealth of information that the stones provide can be found in the different movements and reasons for erecting the stones, in each region respectively. Approximately ten percent of the known runestones announce the travels and deaths of men abroad. These runic inscriptions coincide with certain Latin sources, such as the &quot;Annals of St. Bertin&quot; and the writings of Liudprand of Cremona, which contain valuable information on Scandinavians/Rus&#x27; who visited Byzantium.

==Imagery==
The inscription is usually arranged inside a band, which often has the shape of a serpent, a dragon or a quadruped beast.

===Norse legends===
It appears from the imagery of the Swedish runestones that the most popular Norse legend in the area was that of Sigurd the dragon slayer. He is depicted on several runestones, but the most famous of them is the Ramsund inscription. The inscription itself is of a common kind that tells of the building of a bridge, but the ornamentation shows Sigurd sitting in a pit thrusting his sword, forged by Regin, through the body of the dragon, which also forms the runic band in which the runes are engraved. In the left part of the inscription lies Regin, who is beheaded with all his smithying tools around him. To the right of Regin, Sigurd is sitting and he has just burnt his thumb on the dragon&#x27;s heart that he is roasting. He is putting the thumb in his mouth and begins to understand the language of the marsh-tits that are sitting in the tree. They warn him of Regin&#x27;s schemes. Sigurd&#x27;s horse Grani is also shown tethered to the tree.

Another important personage from the legend of the Nibelungs is Gunnarr. On the Västerljung Runestone, there are three sides and one of them shows a man whose arms and legs are encircled by snakes. He is holding his arms stretched out gripping an object that may be a harp, but that part is damaged due to flaking. The image appears to be depicting an older version of the Gunnarr legend in which he played the harp with his fingers, which appears in the archaic eddic poem &quot;Atlakviða&quot;.

===Norse myths===

The Norse god who was most popular was Thor, and the Altuna Runestone in Uppland shows Thor&#x27;s fishing expedition when he tried to capture the Midgard Serpent. Two centuries later, the Icelander Snorri Sturluson would write: &quot;The Midgarth Serpent bit at the ox-head and the hook caught in the roof of its mouth. When it felt that, it started so violently that both Thor&#x27;s fists went smack against the gunwale. Then Thor got angry, assumed all his godly strength, and dug his heels so sturdily that his feet went right through the bottom of the boat and he braced them on the sea bed.&quot; (Jansson&#x27;s translation). The Altuna Runestone has also included the foot that went through the planks.

It appears that Ragnarök is depicted on the Ledberg stone in Östergötland. On one of its sides it shows a large warrior with a helmet, and who is bitten at his feet by a beast. This beast is, it is presumed, Fenrir, the brother of the Midgard Serpent, and who is attacking Odin. On the bottom of the illustration, there is a prostrate man who is holding out his hands and who has no legs. There is a close parallel from an illustration at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man. The Manx illustration shows Odin with a spear and with one of his ravens on his shoulders, and Odin is attacked in the same way as he is on the Ledberg stone. Adding to the stone&#x27;s spiritual content is a magic formula that was known all across the world of the pagan Norsemen.

On one of the stones from the Hunnestad Monument in Scania, there is an image of a woman riding a wolf using snakes as reins. The stone may be an illustration of the giantess Hyrrokin (&quot;fire-wrinkled&quot;), who was summoned by the gods to help launch Baldr&#x27;s funeral ship &quot;Hringhorni&quot;, which was too heavy for them. It was the same kind of wolf that is referred to as the &quot;Valkyrie horse&quot; on the Rök runestone.

==Colour==

Today, most runestones are painted with falu red, since the colour red makes it easy to discern the ornamentation, and it is appropriate since red paint was also used on runes during the Viking Age. In fact, one of the Old Norse words for &quot;writing in runes&quot; was &quot;fá&quot; and it originally meant &quot;to paint&quot; in Proto-Norse (&quot;faihian&quot;). Moreover, in &quot;Hávamál&quot;, Odin says: &quot;So do I write / and colour the runes&quot; and in &quot;Guðrúnarkviða II&quot;, Gudrun says &quot;In the cup were runes of every kind / Written and reddened, I could not read them&quot;.

There are several runestones where it is declared that they were originally painted. A runestone in Södermanland says &quot;Here shall these stones stand, reddened with runes&quot;, a second runestone in the same province says &quot;Ásbjörn carved and Ulfr painted&quot; and a third runestone in Södermanland says &quot;Ásbjôrn cut the stone, painted as a marker, bound with runes&quot;. Sometimes, the original colours have been preserved unusually well, and especially if the runestones were used as construction material in churches not very long after they had been made. One runestone in the church of Köping on Öland was discovered to be painted all over, and the colour of the words was alternating between black and red.

The most common paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water. It also appears that the Vikings imported white lead, green malachite and blue azurite from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists have been able to analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours were white and red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in &quot;Grettis saga&quot;, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in &quot;Egils saga&quot; where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.

==Preservation and care==
The exposed runestones face several threats to the inscribed rock surface.

In Sweden, lichen grows at approximately per year. In more ideal conditions it can grow considerably faster. Many runestones are placed alongside roads and road dust causes lichen to grow faster, making lichen a major problem. The lichen&#x27;s small root strands break through the rock, and blast off tiny pieces, making the rock porous, and over time degrade the inscriptions. Algae and moss also cause the rock to become porous and crumble.

Water entering the cracks and crevices of the stone can cause whole sections to fall off either by freezing or by a combination of dirt, organic matter, and moisture, which can cause a hollowing effect under the stone surface.

Proper preservation techniques slow down the rate of degradation. One method to combat the lichen, algae and moss problem is to smear in fine-grained moist clay over the entire stone. This is then left to sit for a few weeks, which suffocates the organic matter and kills it.

<text>Toad in the hole is a traditional British dish consisting of sausages in Yorkshire pudding batter, usually served with onion gravy and vegetables. Historically, the dish has also been prepared using other meats, such as rump steak and lamb&#x27;s kidney.

==History==

=== 18th century origins ===
Batter puddings became popular in the early 18th century. Cookery writer Jennifer Stead has drawn attention to a description of a recipe identical to toad in the hole from the middle of the century. 

Dishes like toad in the hole appeared in print as early as 1762, when it was described as a &quot;vulgar&quot; name for a &quot;small piece of beef baked in a large pudding&quot;. Toad in the hole was originally created as a way to stretch out meat in poor households. Chefs therefore suggested using the cheapest meats in this dish. In 1747, for example, Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery&quot; listed a recipe for &quot;pigeon in a hole&quot;, calling for pigeon rather than sausages. 

=== 19th century ===
In 1861, Isabella Beeton listed a similar recipe using rump steak and lamb&#x27;s kidney, while Charles Elmé Francatelli&#x27;s 1852 recipe mentions &quot;6&quot;d&quot;. or 1&quot;s&quot;.&quot; worth of any kind of cheap meat. This recipe was described as &quot;English cooked-again stewed meat&quot; (&quot;lesso rifatto all&#x27;inglese&quot;) or &quot;toad in the Hole&quot;, in the first book of modern Italian cuisine, which stressed that meat was to be left over from stews and re-cooked in batter.

=== 20th century ===
During World War I, school children were often fed toad in the hole for the midday meal.

=== 21st century ===
In 2017, a marketing survey found that 23% of British people had never tried toad in the hole. In the 21st century, vegetarian and vegan versions of toad in the hole appeared. These included vegan versions made with Linda McCartney Food&#x27;s vegan sausages and a vegetarian version published by Ravinder Bhogal that combined toad in the hole with cauliflower cheese.

== Name ==
The dish with left over meat was originally not called toad in the hole. In the 1787 book &quot;A Provincial Glossary&quot; by Francis Grose, for example, &quot;toad in a hole&quot; was referred to as &quot;meat boiled in a crust&quot;, though a 28 September 1765 passage in The Newcastle Chronicle reads, &quot;No, you shall lay on the common side of the world; like a toad in a hole that is bak&#x27;d for the Devil&#x27;s dinner&quot;. The first appearance of the word &quot;hole&quot; in the dish&#x27;s name, not counting &quot;Pigeons in a Hole&quot; found in the cookbook by Hannah Glasse, appeared in the 1900 publication &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot;, which described the dish as a &quot;batter-pudding with a hole in the middle containing meat&quot;. Despite popular belief, there is no record of the dish ever being made with toad. 

The origin of the name is unclear, but it may refer to the way toads wait for their prey in their burrows, with their heads poking out, just as sausages peep through the batter. It may also derive from the &quot;living entombed animal&quot; phenomenon of live frogs or toads supposedly being found encased in stone, which was a popular hoax / false belief of the late 18th century.

The term is sometimes used for &quot;egg in the basket&quot; (an egg fried in a hole of a slice of bread).

<text>Durability is the ability of a physical product to remain functional, without requiring excessive maintenance or repair, when faced with the challenges of normal operation over its design lifetime. There are several measures of durability in use, including years of life, hours of use, and number of operational cycles. In economics, goods with a long usable life are referred to as durable goods.

Because there is no objective measure of durability for clothing, price has become an important indicator.

== Requirements for product durability ==

Product durability is predicated by good repairability and regenerability in conjunction with maintenance. Every durable product must be capable of adapting to technical, technological and design developments. This must be accompanied by a willingness on the part of consumers to forgo having the &quot;very latest&quot; version of a product.

In the United Kingdom, durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods that can be demanded by consumers was not clearly established until an amendment of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994.

Reliability testing verifies the resistance of a product or material to wear. Common tests evaluate fatigue, abrasion, corrosion and exposure to environmental conditions.

== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ==
The lifespan of household goods is a significant factor in sustainable consumption. Longer product life spans can contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable level of consumption. Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product lifespans to sustainable production and consumption.

==Types of durability==

Durability can encompass several specific physical properties of designed products, including:

*Ageing (of polymers)
*Dust resistance
*Resistance to fatigue
*Fire resistance
*Radiation hardening
*Thermal resistance
*Rot-proofing
*Rustproofing
*Toughness
*Waterproofing

==Examples==
*Chemically strengthened glass e.g. Superfest
*Durable medical equipment
*Durable water repellent

*Availability
*Consumables
**Disposable product
*Interchangeable parts
*Maintainability
*Product life
*Product stewardship
*Throwaway society

<doc id="482605" wikidata="Q543076" url="?curid=482605" title="Council of Vienne">
<text>The Council of Vienne was the fifteenth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church and met between 1311 and 1312 in Vienne, France. This occurred during the Avignon Papacy and was the only ecumenical council to be held in the Kingdom of France (the previous 2 had been held in Lyon, which was under the Kingdom of Burgundy). One of its principal acts was to withdraw papal support for the Knights Templar at the instigation of Philip IV of France. The Council, unable to decide on a course of action, tabled the discussion. In March 1312 Philip arrived and pressured the Council and Clement to act. Pope Clement V passed papal bulls dissolving the Templar Order, confiscating their lands, and labeling them heretics.

Church reform was represented by the decision concerning the Franciscans, allowing abbots to decide how to interpret their Rule. The Beguines and Beghards of Germany were condemned as heretics, while the council forbade marriage for clerics, concubinage, rape, fornication, adultery, and incest.

The council addressed the possibility of a crusade, hearing from James II of Aragon and Henry II of Cyprus, before deciding to assign Philip of France as its leader. It was through Philip&#x27;s influence that Clement finally canonized Pietro Angelerio, taking care not to use his papal title Celestine V. The final act of the council was to establish university chairs for Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic languages.

==Background==
The Knights Templar were a military order founded in the twelfth century to ensure the safety of pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem. In the following centuries the order grew in power and wealth. In the early 14th century, Philip IV of France urgently needed money to continue his war with England, and he accused the Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques De Molay, of corruption and heresy. On 13 October 1307 Philip had all French Templars arrested, charged with heresy, and tortured until they allegedly confessed to their charges. These forced admissions released Philip from his obligation to repay loans obtained from the Templars and allowed him to confiscate the Templars&#x27; assets in France.

The arrests of the Knights Templar, coupled with the defiance of the Colonna cardinals and Philip IV against Pope Boniface VIII, convinced Clement V to call a general council. Though the site of Vienne was criticised for its lack of neutrality (being under the control of Philip), Clement nevertheless chose it as the site for the council.

==Council==

Pope Clement V convened the Council by issuing the bulls and on 12 August 1308.

The opening of the Council was delayed, giving time to the Templars to arrive so they could answer the charges put against them, and was not convened until 16 October 1311. The was sent to nearly 500 clerics, prelates, masters of militant Orders, and priors. The attendees consisted of twenty cardinals, four patriarchs, about one hundred archbishops and bishops, plus several abbots and priors. The great princes, including the rulers of Sicily, Hungary, Bohemia, Cyprus, and Scandinavia, as well as the kings of France, England, and the Iberian peninsula, had been invited. No king appeared, except Philip IV who arrived the following spring to pressure the council against the Templars.

===Knights Templar===

The main item on the agenda of the Council not only cited the Order of Knights Templar itself, but also &quot;its lands&quot;, which suggested that further seizures of property were proposed. Besides this, the agenda also invited archbishops and prelates to bring proposals for improvement in the life of the Church. Special notices were sent to the Templars directing them to send suitable (defenders) to the Council. The Grand Master Jacques de Molay and others were also commanded to appear in person. Molay, however, was already imprisoned in Paris and trials of other Templars were already in progress.

The Council began with a majority of the cardinals and nearly all the members of the Council being of the opinion that the Order of Knights Templar should be granted the right to defend itself. Furthermore, they believed that no proof collected up to then was sufficient to convict the order of the heresy of which Philip accused it. The discussion of Knights Templar was then put on hold.

In February 1312 envoys from the Philip IV negotiated with the Pope, without consulting the Council, and Philip held an assembly in Lyon to put further pressure on the Pope and the Council on the topic of the Templars. Philip IV then went to Vienne on 20 March. Clement was forced to adopt the expedient of suppressing the Order of Knights Templar, not by legal methods (&quot;de jure&quot;), but on the grounds of the general welfare of the Church and by Apostolic ordinance (). The Pope then presented to the commission of cardinals (for their approval) the bull to suppress the Templars in (&quot;A voice from on high&quot;), dated 22 March 1312.

The Council, to placate Philip IV of France, condemned the Templars, delivering their wealth in France to him. Delegates for King James II of Aragon insisted the Templar property in Aragon be given to the Order of Calatrava. The bulls of 2 May and of 16 May confiscated Templar property. The fate of the Templars themselves was decided by the bull of 6 May. In the bulls (18 Dec 1312), (31 Dec 1312) and (13 Jan 1313), Clement V dealt with further aspects of the Templars&#x27; property.

===Church reform===
The Council instituted into canon law the ecclesiastical tradition of forbidding clerical marriages. Included in this were punishments for concubinage, rape, fornication, adultery, and incest. Any cleric who broke canon law was deposed, and their marriages ruled invalid.

====Franciscan rule====
Prior to the Council, Ubertino da Casale, formerly a friar at Santa Croce, Florence, protested that only a few brethren were following the Rule of Saint Francis. These brethren were called spirituals. Upon arrival at the Council, the spirituals, defended by Ubertino of Casale, faced opposition from those that ran the Franciscan order.

At the final session of the council, Clement issued the papal bull reinforcing the previous bull, , which left decisions regarding behaviour and accumulation of wine and grain to the abbot in charge of that monastery.

====Disbanding the Beguines====
In 1312, the Council and Clement&#x27;s papal bull, , condemned the Beguines and Beghards movement, a group of laymen and laywomen that lived in semi-monastic communities, as heretical. According to the Council, members of this movement were deemed heretics because of their antinomian heresy of the &quot;Free Spirit&quot;. Following the Council&#x27;s decision, there were instances where Beghards and Beguines were burned as heretics.

===Crusade and Philip IV&#x27;s vow===
A crusade was also discussed as part of the Council. The delegates of the King of Aragon wanted to attack the Muslim city of Granada. In response, the papal vice-chancellor suggested to the Aragonese delegates that the Catalans, now located in Thebes and Athens, should march through the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia to attack the Muslims in the Holy Land. Henry II of Cyprus&#x27; envoys suggested a naval blockade to coincide with an invasion of Egypt.

On 3 April 1312, Philip IV vowed to the council to go on crusade within the next six years. Clement, however, insisted the crusade begin within one year and assigned Philip as its leader. Philip died 29 November 1314, but the crusading tithe instituted by the church had been spent by the reign of Charles IV of France.

===University chairs===
The Council decreed the establishment of chairs (professorships) of Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic at the Universities of Avignon, Paris, Oxford, Bologna and Salamanca, although the chairs of Arabic were not actually set up. The delegates from Aragon pushed for the creation of an adequate place to teach different languages so as to preach the Gospel to every man.
===Canonization of Peter di Murrone===
The issue of Pope Celestine V&#x27;s (Pietro Angelerio) sainthood was brought to the Council. There was division on his canonisation amongst the cardinals; the Colonna contingent voted for his canonization while the Caetera group voted against. Clement assigned a commission of prelates from outside the papal curia to investigate the issue. Clement was still hesitant to canonize Angelerio after the report was completed, until Philip IV&#x27;s influence forced the issue. Clement waited two years to canonize Pietro Angelerio. Clement used his given name as saint, rather than his papal name of Celestine V refusing to fully surrender to Capetian influence.

==Aftermath==
The Council ended on 6 May 1312. A Parisian chronicler, John of Saint-Victor, stated, &quot;It was said by many that the council was created for the purpose of extorting money.&quot; The French ascendancy into the highest echelons of the Church hierarchy became very obvious at the Council.

According to the Friedberg edition of the all of Clement&#x27;s decrees were made at the Council of Vienne. John XXII&#x27;s prefatory letter, however, states Clement combined decrees drafted before and after the meeting at Vienne. In 1312, in anticipation of a revised version of the Council being drafted at the time, Clement ordered that copies of the Vienne decrees that were then in circulation be recalled or burned. The final draft was approved in March 1314, but Clement&#x27;s death interrupted the distribution of the new copies.

<text>Ouarzazate (; , ), nicknamed &quot;the door of the desert&quot;, is a city and capital of Ouarzazate Province in the region of Drâa-Tafilalet, south-central Morocco. 

Ouarzazate is a primary tourist destination in Morocco during the holidays, as well as a starting point for excursions into and across the Draa Valley and the desert. The fortified village Aït Benhaddou west of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Ouarzazate area is a noted film-making location, with Morocco&#x27;s biggest studios inviting many international companies to work here. Films such as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975), &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005), &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997), &quot;Legionnaire&quot; (1998), &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (2006), &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (2024) were shot here, as was part of the TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. It was the filming location for the fictional city of Agapenta in the fourth season of the Netflix series Outer Banks.

==Etymology==
Its name comes from a Berber phrase meaning &quot;without noise&quot; or &quot;without confusion&quot;.

==History==
For a long time, Ouarzazate was a small crossing point for African traders on their way to northern Morocco and Europe. In the 16th century, Sheikh Abu al-&#x27;Abaas Ahmed bin Abdellah al-Wizkiti al-Warzazi, emir of the &quot;qasba&quot; of Ouarzazate and father of Lalla Masuda, helped establish Saadi control over the Sous-Dra&#x27;a region. 

Ouarzazate was home to a thriving Jewish community. In 1954, about 170 Jews lived in the Mellah. The &quot;Old Synagogue&quot;, a synagogue said to be nearly 300 years old, is located in Ouarzazate. There is also a Jewish cemetery, which is no longer in use.

During the French period, Ouarzazate expanded considerably as a garrison town, administrative centre and customs post and a church (Eglise Saint Therese) was built in 1931. It is home to the Kasbah Taourirt, which was the kasbah of the former caïd and later owned by T&#x27;hami El Glaoui. The Krupp field gun which secured Glaoui power is displayed outside the kasbah today. 

The city was part of the route of the 2006 and 2007 Dakar Rally.

The nearby Ouarzazate solar power station, co-funded by the Arab League, was connected to the Moroccan power grid in February 2016.

On 1 November 2023, Ouarzazate along with Casablanca joined UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network.

== Geography ==
Ouarzazate is at an elevation of in the middle of a bare plateau south of the High Atlas Mountains, with a desert to the city&#x27;s south.

==Climate==
Ouarzazate has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). The city is hot and dry in summer, but can be very cold in winter, with icy winds coming from the High Atlas Mountains.


== Landmarks ==
The Kasbah Taourirt is the city&#x27;s historic kasbah (fortified residence, or &quot;tighremt&quot; in Berber languages). It was owned and expanded by the Glaoui family in the late 19th century and the 20th century. Built mainly of rammed earth, it is one of the most impressive examples of this type of structure, which characterizes the architecture of the predominantly Berber-inhabited Atlas mountain and oasis regions of Morocco.

A short distance west of the city is Aït Benhaddou, a historic ksar (fortified village) and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
==Film industry==

Film is a major industry in Ouarazazate and constitute a major part of its economy. Its success is due to the presence of desert landscapes and historical architecture, the availability of trained technicians, low productions costs, and Morocco&#x27;s streamlined process for obtaining film permits. Most productions are from the USA or Western Europe, but the number of Indian and Chinese productions has also increased in recent years. According to a study published in 2020, about 20 to 50 foreign film and television productions are shot in Ouarzazate every year. In 2017, the heads of Moroccan film studios claimed that about 80 percent of staff used on film productions were Moroccan.

Atlas Studios is the largest movie studios in the world in terms of land area. It was established in 1983. Movies were shot here including &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Hanna&quot;, and &quot;Babel&quot;. It was also the location of an episode of the television series &quot;The Amazing Race 10&quot; and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; season 3. &quot;Prison Break&quot; season 5 was filmed here.

Another large studio in Ouarzazate is CLA Studios, established in 2004.

The Cinema Museum, located across from the Kasbah Taourirt, opened in 2007 and is housed in a former film studio. The museum displays film sets, props, and technical equipment from previous productions.

<doc id="482611" wikidata="Q3304394" url="?curid=482611" title="Pork pie">
<text>A pork pie is a traditional English meat pie, usually served either at room temperature or cold (although often served hot in Yorkshire). It consists of a filling of roughly chopped pork and pork fat, surrounded by a layer of jellied pork stock in a hot water crust pastry. It is normally eaten as a snack or with a salad.

==History==

Modern pork pies are a direct descendant of the raised meat pies of medieval cuisine, which used a dense hot water crust pastry as a simple means of preserving the filling. In France the same recipes gave rise to the modern . Many medieval meat pie recipes were sweetened, often with fruit, and were meant to be eaten cold: the crust was discarded rather than being eaten. A particularly elaborate and spectacular recipe described in medieval recipe collection &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; was a meat pie featuring a crust formed into battlements and filled with sweet custards, the entire pie then being served flambeed: a distant descendant of this dish, with hollow pastry turrets around a central pork pie, was still current in the 18th century under the name &quot;battalia pie&quot;. Hannah Glasse&#x27;s influential 1747 recipe collection included a recipe for a &quot;Cheshire pork pie&quot;, having a filling of layers of pork loin and apple, slightly sweetened with sugar, and filled with half a pint (285ml) of white wine. By the 19th century sweetened fruit and meat combinations had become less common, and the raised crust pork pie took its modern form.

==Types==
Traditional pies use a mix of fat and cured meat, giving the filling a pink colour. They are often produced in moulds or forms, giving the outside of the pie a very regular shape. This method is simpler and cheaper for volume production, and hence the more common choice for commercial manufacturers.

As the meat shrinks when the pie is cooked, traditional recipes specified that clarified butter or a hot pork stock was poured into the pie after baking. This would set when cool, filling the gap between meat and pastry and preventing air from reaching the filling and causing it to spoil. Commercial makers use a 6% solution of gelatin at between , added into the pie immediately after baking.

===Melton Mowbray pork pie===
The Melton Mowbray pork pie is named after Melton Mowbray, a town in Leicestershire. While it is sometimes claimed that Melton pies became popular among fox hunters in the area in the late eighteenth century, it has also been stated that the association of the pork pie trade with Melton originated around 1831 as a sideline in a small baker and confectioners&#x27; shop in the town, owned by Edward Adcock. Within the next decade a number of other bakers then started supplying them, notably Enoch Evans, a former grocer, who seems to have been particularly responsible for establishing the industry on a large scale. Whether true or not the association with hunting provided valuable publicity, although one local hunting columnist writing in 1872 stated that it was extremely unlikely that &quot;our aristocratic visitors carry lumps of pie with them on horseback&quot;.

The main distinctive feature of a Melton pie is that it is made with a hand-formed crust. The uncured meat of a Melton pie is grey in colour when cooked and the meat is chopped, rather than minced. As the pies are baked free-standing, the sides bow outwards, rather than being vertical as with mould-baked pies. Melton Mowbray pork pies are served at room temperature, unlike pork pies in Yorkshire which may be served hot.

In the light of the premium price of the Melton Mowbray pie, the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association applied for protection under European protected designation of origin laws as a result of the increasing production of Melton Mowbray-style pies by large commercial companies in factories far from Melton Mowbray, and recipes that deviated from the original uncured pork form. Protection was granted on 4 April 2008, with the result that only pies made within a designated zone around Melton (made within a zone around the town), and using the traditional recipe including uncured pork, are allowed to carry the Melton Mowbray name on their packaging.

There is a tradition in the East Midlands of eating pork pies for breakfast at Christmas. While its origin is unclear, the association of pork pies with Christmas dates back to at least the mid-19th century and it was by far the busiest time of year for the Melton manufacturers.

=== Pork pies in Yorkshire ===
In Yorkshire, pork pies are often served hot, accompanied with gravy or with mushy peas and mint sauce. It is also a common combination served at Bonfire Night celebrations. In Yorkshire slang a pork pie is sometimes called a &quot;growler&quot;, a term probably derived from the &quot;NAAFI growler&quot; of earlier naval and army slang.

An annual pork pie competition is held in April at The Old Bridge Inn, Ripponden, Yorkshire.

==Variations==

The &quot;gala pie&quot; is a variety of pork pie where the filling includes a proportion of chicken and a hard-boiled egg (also known as a &quot;Grosvenor pie&quot;). Gala pies are often baked in long, loaf-type tins, with multiple eggs arranged along the centre. 
Smaller, , varieties, sometimes branded as a &quot;picnic pie&quot;, often have additional ingredients added to the filling such as apples, pickles and bacon.

In some cases the solid pastry top is replaced by a pastry lattice, allowing the meat filling to be seen. A recent development is to have a layer of Branston pickle inserted under the lattice crust. Occasionally the top crust is dispensed with altogether in favour of a layer of cranberries sealed into place with aspic.

<doc id="482612" wikidata="Q1666491" url="?curid=482612" title="Hua Hin district">
<text>Hua Hin (, ) is one of eight districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Prachuap Khiri Khan province in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula in Thailand. Its seat of government, also named Hua Hin, is a beach resort town. The district&#x27;s population was estimated at 65,983 in December 2019 by the Bureau of Registration Administration in an area of . By road, it is south-southwest of Bangkok.

Hua Hin district is in the middle of what the Thai government is promoting as the “Thai Riviera”, the stretch of coastline between Phetchaburi in the north and Chumphon in the south.

==History==
In 1834, before the name Hua Hin was coined, some agricultural areas of Phetchaburi province were hit by severe drought. A group of farmers moved south until they found a small village that had bright white sand and a row of rocks along the beach. They settled there and gave it the name &quot;Samore Riang&quot; (&quot;Samo Riang&quot;), which means &#x27;rows of rocks&#x27;.

In 1921 the director of the state railway, Prince Purachatra, built the Railway Hotel close to the beach. Prince Krom Phra Naresworarit was the first member of the royal family to build a group of palaces at Ban Laem Hin, called Sukaves, and gave the beach next to his palace the name &quot;Hua Hin&quot;. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) liked the place so much that he built a summer palace there which was later named &quot;Klai Kang Won&quot; (&#x27;far from worries&#x27;). From 2004 until 2006 it was the full-time residence of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), until health issues forced him to return to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where medical facilities and physicians were closer at hand.

In 1932 Hua Hin was part of Pran Buri district as a minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;). In 1949 Hua Hin became a separate district of Prachuap Khiri Khan. After the building of Thailand&#x27;s southern railway connected the district with Bangkok along with various destinations en route, Hua Hin became the first and most popular beach resort in the country. Over the five-year period from 2014 to 2019, the number of Thai and foreign visitors to Hua Hin has risen six percent per year.

In August 2016, there were four bomb blasts in Hua Hin over a period of 24 hours. One person died, 20 others were injured. In the aftermath of the bombing 90 security cameras were installed and are monitored by the Tourist Police. Another 60 cameras are monitored by the municipal office. There are plans to install several hundred more.

==Climate==
Hua Hin has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Historically, temperatures are very warm to hot throughout the year, with only small variations. The year begins with the dry season (December–April), before the monsoon arrives in May. Rains ease somewhat from June to August before the heaviest rains begin in September and continue through November.

== Administration ==

=== Central administration ===
Hua Hin district is divided into seven sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 63 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

=== Local administration ===
There is one town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in the district:
* Hua Hin (Thai: ) consisting of sub-districts Hua Hin and Nong Kae.

There is one sub-district municipality (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) in the district:
* Nong Phlap (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Nong Phlap.

There are five sub-district administrative organizations (SAO) in the district:
* Hin Lek Fai (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Hin Lek Fai.
* Nong Phlap (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Nong Phlap.
* Thap Tai (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Thap Tai.
* Huai Sat Yai (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Huai Sat Yai.
* Bueng Nakhon (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Bueng Nakhon.

==Environment==
The quality of the waters of the Gulf of Thailand off central Hua Hin were rated &quot; good to fair&quot; in 2016 by the Pollution Control Department.

==Boundaries==
Hua Hin district is bordered by:

*North: Cha-am district, Phetchaburi province.
*East: Gulf of Thailand
*West: Myanmar (Burma)
*South: Pran Buri district, Prachuap Khiri Khan province.

== Transport ==
Hua Hin is served by road, rail, and sea routes.
The main station is Hua Hin railway station and it is the northernmost station in the district. Smaller stations are also located in the area including Nong Kae railway station which is closer to Khao Takiap, Suan Son Pradiphat Railway Halt, close to Suan Son Pradiphat Beach and Rajabhakti Park as well as Khao Tao railway station.

, work is underway on the construction of double tracks from Bangkok&#x27;s Bang Sue Central Station to Chumphon. Trains will travel the route at up to 160 kilometres per hour. The new tracks—due to be completed in 2022—will enable trains to travel the Bangkok–Hua Hin segment in &quot;two to three hours&quot; according to a State Railway of Thailand (SRT) spokesman. As a comparison, , SRT&#x27;s Train 44 travels from Hua Hin to Bangkok&#x27;s Bangkok Railway Station in three hours and thirty-three minutes (02:22–05:55). Plans for high-speed rail from Bangkok to Surat Thani which would serve Hua Hin en route, have been shelved due to lack of investor interest.

Since 2018, there is no longer daily ferry service between Hua Hin and Pattaya. In November 2018, Hua Hin deputy chief Chareewat Phramanee confirmed the ferry service, suspended due to low tourist numbers during low season, would be up and running again for high season between Hua Hin and Pattaya, a 2.5 hour journey on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 340.

Hua Hin Airport is in Hua Hin District. AirAsia serves the airport with a direct flight only to Chiang Mai. The other destinations have been discontinued.

In August 2018 the Department of Airports announced that it will spend 3.5 billion baht to upgrade Hua Hin Airport over the next five years. The number of travellers using the airport is expected to increase by tenfold, to three million a year, in that time frame. The upgrade is part of the &quot;Riviera Thailand&quot; and Southern Economic Corridor projects. The work at the airport will take four to five years. It includes enlarging the existing passenger terminal, building a second one, expanding hangar space, and widening the runway from 30 to 45 metres.

== Health ==
Hua Hin is served by Hua Hin Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health. It is the largest hospital in Prachuap Khiri Khan province.

They are also 2 more Hospital that&#x27;s popular in Hua-Hin

Bangkok Hospital

San Paulo Hua-Hin Hospital

==Education==
Hua Hin and Cha-am host a number of tertiary education institutions such as Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Silpakorn University, Suan Dusit Rajabhat (Hospitality) University, and the Petchaburi Technology and Agricultural University. Webster University Thailand had a campus near Hua Hin, but ceased operations on December 31, 2021. The Rajamangala University of Technology also has a campus in the vicinity, the Rattanakosin (Wangklaikangwon Campus).

<doc id="482626" wikidata="Q1083697" url="?curid=482626" title="Western Interior Seaway">
<text>The Western Interior Seaway (also called the Cretaceous Seaway, the Niobraran Sea, the North American Inland Sea, or the Western Interior Sea) was a large inland sea that split the continent of North America into two landmasses for 34 million years. The ancient sea, which existed from the early Late Cretaceous (100 Ma) to the earliest Paleocene (66 Ma), connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The two land masses it created were Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. At its largest extent, it was deep, wide and over long.

==Origin and geology==

By the late Cretaceous, Eurasia and the Americas had separated along the south Atlantic, and subduction on the west coast of the Americas had commenced, resulting in the Laramide orogeny, the early phase of growth of the modern Rocky Mountains. The Western Interior Seaway may be seen as a downwarping of the continental crust ahead of the growing Laramide/Rockies mountain chain. 

The earliest phase of the seaway began in the mid-Cretaceous when an arm of the Arctic Ocean transgressed south over western North America; this formed the Mowry Sea, so named for the Mowry Shale, an organic-rich rock formation. In the south, the Gulf of Mexico was originally an extension of the Tethys Ocean. In time, the southern embayment merged with the Mowry Sea in the late Cretaceous, forming a completed seaway, creating isolated environments for land animals and plants. 

Relative sea levels fell multiple times, as a margin of land temporarily rose above the water along the ancestral Transcontinental Arch, each time rejoining the separated, divergent land populations, allowing a temporary mixing of newer species before again separating the populations.

At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from the Rockies east to the Appalachian Mountains, some wide. At its deepest, it may have been only deep, shallow in terms of seas. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded silt that formed shifting delta systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little sedimentation on the eastern shores of the seaway; the western boundary, however, consisted of a thick clastic wedge eroded eastward from the Sevier orogenic belt. The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in sea level and sediment supply.

Widespread carbonate deposition suggests that the seaway was warm and tropical, with abundant calcareous planktonic algae. Remnants of these deposits are found in northwest Kansas. A prominent example is Monument Rocks, an exposed chalk formation towering over the surrounding range land. The Western Interior Seaway is believed to have behaved similarly to a giant estuary in terms of water mass transport. Riverine inputs exited the seaway as coastal jets, while correspondingly drawing in water from the Tethys in the south and Boreal waters from the north. During the late Cretaceous, the Western Interior Seaway went through multiple periods of anoxia, when the bottom water was devoid of oxygen and the water column was stratified.

At the end of the Cretaceous, continued Laramide uplift hoisted the sandbanks (sandstone) and muddy brackish lagoons (shale), thick sequences of silt and sandstone still seen today as the Laramie Formation, while low-lying basins between them gradually subsided. The Western Interior Seaway divided across the Dakotas and retreated south towards the Gulf of Mexico. This shrunken and final regressive phase is sometimes called the Pierre Seaway.

During the early Paleocene, parts of the Western Interior Seaway still occupied areas of the Mississippi Embayment, submerging the site of present-day Memphis. Later transgression, however, was associated with the Cenozoic Tejas sequence, rather than with the previous event responsible for the seaway.

==Phases==
The Western Interior Seaway experienced multiple sequences of transgression and regression as the sea level rose and lowered, respectively. Over at least the last 20 million years of the Cretaceous, the seaway generally regressed, but period of transgression over time have been given different names relative to their cyclothem. The Niobrara sea was formed by the first sea level rise expanding the seaway westward, which then regressed through the Aquilian Land-vertebrate age. Following this, the sea level rose again in the &quot;Clagette transgression&quot;, named for the Clagette Shale, before regressing again in the Judithian. The sea level then rose again to form the shallow Bearpaw Sea of the &quot;Bearpaw transgression&quot; (named after the Bearpaw Shale), which expanded over much of Wyoming, Montana, and the prairie provinces, before regressing in the Edmontonian. Following this was a localized &quot;Lewis&quot; sea separated from the Bearpaw Sea to the north, before more regression of the Western Interior Seaway.

==Fauna==
The Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea, filled with abundant marine life. Interior seaway denizens included predatory marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs. Other marine life included sharks such as &quot;Squalicorax, Cretoxyrhina,&quot; and the giant durophagous &quot;Ptychodus mortoni&quot; (believed to be  long); and advanced bony fish including &quot;Pachyrhizodus&quot;, &quot;Enchodus&quot;, and the massive long &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;, larger than any modern bony fish. Other sea life included invertebrates such as mollusks, ammonites, squid-like belemnites, and plankton including coccolithophores that secreted the chalky platelets that give the Cretaceous its name, foraminiferans and radiolarians.

The seaway was home to early birds, including the flightless &quot;Hesperornis&quot; that had stout legs for swimming through water and tiny wings used for marine steering rather than flight; and the tern-like &quot;Ichthyornis&quot;, an early avian with a toothy beak. &quot;Ichthyornis&quot; shared the sky with large pterosaurs such as &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. &quot;Pteranodon&quot; fossils are very common; it was probably a major participant in the surface ecosystem, though it was found in only the southern reaches of the seaway.

Inoceramids (oyster-like bivalve molluscs) were well-adapted to life in the oxygen-poor bottom mud of the seaway. These left abundant fossils in the Kiowa, Greenhorn, Niobrara, Mancos, and Pierre formations. There is great variety in the shells and the many distinct species have been dated and can be used to identify specific beds in those rock formations of the seaway. Many species can easily fit in the palm of the hand, while some like &quot;Inoceramus (Haploscapha) grandis&quot; could be well over a meter in diameter. Entire schools of fish sometimes sought shelter within the shell of the giant &quot;Platyceramus&quot;. The shells of the genus are known for being composed of prismatic calcitic crystals that grew perpendicular to the surface, and fossils often retain a pearly luster.

<text>Scavengers are animals that consume dead organisms that have died from causes other than predation or have been killed by other predators. While scavenging generally refers to carnivores feeding on carrion, it is also a herbivorous feeding behavior. Scavengers play an important role in the ecosystem by consuming dead animal and plant material. &quot;Decomposers&quot; and detritivores complete this process, by consuming the remains left by scavengers.

Scavengers aid in overcoming fluctuations of food resources in the environment. The process and rate of scavenging is affected by both biotic and abiotic factors, such as carcass size, habitat, temperature, and seasons.

== Etymology ==
Scavenger is an alteration of &quot;scavager,&quot; from Middle English &quot;skawager&quot; meaning &quot;customs collector&quot;, from &quot;skawage&quot; meaning &quot;customs&quot;, from Old North French &quot;escauwage&quot; meaning &quot;inspection&quot;, from &quot;schauwer&quot; meaning &quot;to inspect&quot;, of Germanic origin; akin to Old English &quot;scēawian&quot; and German &quot;schauen&quot; meaning &quot;to look at&quot;, and modern English &quot;show&quot; (with semantic drift).

== Types of scavengers (animals) ==
Obligate scavenging (subsisting entirely or mainly on dead animals) is rare among vertebrates, due to the difficulty of finding enough carrion without expending too much energy.

Well-known invertebrate scavengers of animal material include burying beetles and blowflies, which are obligate scavengers, and yellowjackets. Fly larvae are also common scavengers for organic materials at the bottom of freshwater bodies. For example, &quot;Tokunagayusurika akamusi&quot; is a species of midge fly whose larvae live as obligate scavengers at the bottom of lakes and whose adults almost never feed and only live up to a few weeks.

Most scavenging animals are facultative scavengers that gain most of their food through other methods, especially predation. Many large carnivores that hunt regularly, such as hyenas and jackals, but also animals rarely thought of as scavengers, such as African lions, leopards, and wolves will scavenge if given the chance. They may also use their size and ferocity to intimidate the original hunters (the cheetah is a notable victim, rather than a perpetrator). Almost all scavengers above insect size are predators and will hunt if not enough carrion is available, as few ecosystems provide enough dead animals year-round to keep its scavengers fed on that alone. Scavenging wild dogs and crows frequently exploit roadkill.

Scavengers of dead plant material include termites that build nests in grasslands and then collect dead plant material for consumption within the nest. The interaction between scavenging animals and humans is seen today most commonly in suburban settings with animals such as opossums, polecats and raccoons. In some African towns and villages, scavenging from hyenas is also common.

In the prehistoric eras, the species &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; may have been an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and possibly juvenile sauropods, although some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The debate about whether &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was an apex predator or scavenger was among the longest ongoing feuds in paleontology; however, most scientists now agree that &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; was an opportunistic carnivore, acting mostly as a predator but also scavenging when it could sense it. Recent research also shows that while an adult &quot;T. rex&quot; would energetically gain little through scavenging, smaller theropods of approximately might have gained levels similar to those of hyenas, though not enough for them to rely on scavenging. 

Other research suggests that carcasses of giant sauropods may have made scavenging much more profitable to carnivores than it is now. For example, a single 40 tonne &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; carcass would have been worth roughly 6 years of calories for an average allosaur. As a result of this resource oversupply, it is possible that some theropods evolved to get most of their calories by scavenging giant sauropod carcasses, and may not have needed to consistently hunt in order to survive. The same study suggested that theropods in relatively sauropod-free environments, such as tyrannosaurs, were not exposed to the same type of carrion oversupply, and were therefore forced to hunt in order to survive.

Animals which consume feces, such as dung beetles, are referred to as coprovores. Animals that collect small particles of dead organic material of both animal and plant origin are referred to as detritivores.

== Ecological function ==
Scavengers play a fundamental role in the environment through the removal of decaying organisms, serving as a natural sanitation service. While microscopic and invertebrate decomposers break down dead organisms into simple organic matter which are used by nearby autotrophs, scavengers help conserve energy and nutrients obtained from carrion within the upper trophic levels, and are able to disperse the energy and nutrients farther away from the site of the carrion than decomposers.

Scavenging unites animals which normally would not come into contact, and results in the formation of highly structured and complex communities which engage in nonrandom interactions. Scavenging communities function in the redistribution of energy obtained from carcasses and reducing diseases associated with decomposition. Oftentimes, scavenger communities differ in consistency due to carcass size and carcass types, as well as by seasonal effects as consequence of differing invertebrate and microbial activity.

Competition for carrion results in the inclusion or exclusion of certain scavengers from access to carrion, shaping the scavenger community. When carrion decomposes at a slower rate during cooler seasons, competitions between scavengers decrease, while the number of scavenger species present increases.

Alterations in scavenging communities may result in drastic changes to the scavenging community in general, reduce ecosystem services and have detrimental effects on animal and humans. The reintroduction of gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) into Yellowstone National Park in the United States caused drastic changes to the prevalent scavenging community, resulting in the provision of carrion to many mammalian and avian species. Likewise, the reduction of vulture species in India lead to the increase of opportunistic species such as feral dogs and rats. The presence of both species at carcasses resulted in the increase of diseases such as rabies and bubonic plague in wildlife and livestock, as feral dogs and rats are transmitters of such diseases. Furthermore, the decline of vulture populations in India has been linked to the increased rates of anthrax in humans due to the handling and ingestion of infected livestock carcasses. An increase of disease transmission has been observed in mammalian scavengers in Kenya due to the decrease in vulture populations in the area, as the decrease in vulture populations resulted in an increase of the number of mammalian scavengers at a given carcass along with the time spent at a carcass.

=== Disease transmission ===
Scavenging may provide a direct and indirect method for transmitting disease between animals. Scavengers of infected carcasses may become hosts for certain pathogens and consequently vectors of disease themselves. An example of this phenomenon is the increased transmission of tuberculosis observed when scavengers engage in eating infected carcasses. Likewise, the ingestion of bat carcasses infected with rabies by striped skunks (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;) resulted in increased infection of these organisms with the virus.

A major vector of transmission of diseases are various bird species, with outbreak being influenced by such carrier birds and their environment. An avian cholera outbreak from 2006 to 2007 off the coast Newfoundland, Canada resulted in the mortality of many marine bird species. The transmission, perpetuation and spread of the outbreak was mainly restricted to gull species who scavenge for food in the area. Similarly, an increase of transmission of avian influenza virus to chickens by domestic ducks from Indonesian farms permitted to scavenge surrounding areas was observed in 2007. The scavenging of ducks in rice paddy fields in particular resulted in increased contact with other bird species feeding on leftover rice, which may have contributed to increased infection and transmission of the avian influenza virus. The domestic ducks may not have demonstrated symptoms of infection themselves, though were observed to excrete high concentrations of the avian influenza virus.

== Threats ==
Many species that scavenge face persecution globally. Vultures, in particular, have faced incredible persecution and threats by humans. Before its ban by regional governments in 2006, the veterinary drug Diclofenac has resulted in at least a 95% decline of &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures in Asia. Habitat loss and food shortage have contributed to the decline of vulture species in West Africa due to the growing human population and over-hunting of vulture food sources, as well as changes in livestock husbandry. Poisoning certain predators to increase the number of game animals is still a common hunting practice in Europe and contributes to the poisoning of vultures when they consume the carcasses of poisoned predators.

== Benefits to humans ==
Highly efficient scavengers, also known as dominant or apex-scavengers, can have benefits to humans. Increases in dominant scavenger populations, such as vultures, can reduce populations of smaller opportunistic scavengers, such as rats. These smaller scavengers are often pests and disease vectors.

==In humans==

In the 1980s, Lewis Binford suggested that early humans primarily obtained meat via scavenging, not through hunting. In 2010, Dennis Bramble and Daniel Lieberman proposed that early carnivorous human ancestors subsequently developed long-distance running behaviors which improved the ability to scavenge and hunt: they could reach scavenging sites more quickly and also pursue a single animal until it could be safely killed at close range due to exhaustion and hyperthermia.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of excarnation—that is, the exposure of dead human bodies to carrion birds and/or other scavenging animals—is the distinctive characteristic of sky burial, which involves the dismemberment of human cadavers of whom the remains are fed to vultures, and traditionally the main funerary rite (alongside cremation) used to dispose of the human body. A similar funerary practice that features excarnation can be found in Zoroastrianism; in order to prevent the pollution of the sacred elements (fire, earth, and water) from contact with decomposing bodies, human cadavers are exposed on the Towers of Silence to be eaten by vultures and wild dogs.

Studies in behavioral ecology and ecological epidemiology have shown that cannibalistic necrophagy, although rare, has been observed as a survival behavior in several social species, including anatomically modern humans; however, episodes of human cannibalism occur rarely in most human societies. Many instances have occurred in human history, especially in times of war and famine, where necrophagy and human cannibalism emerged as a survival behavior, although anthropologists report the usage of ritual cannibalism among funerary practices and as the preferred means of disposal of the dead in some tribal societies.

<text>Eadberht III Præn was the King of Kent from 796 to 798. His brief reign was the result of a rebellion against the hegemony of Mercia, and it marked the last time that Kent existed as an independent kingdom.

Offa of Mercia seems to have ruled Kent directly from 785 until 796, when the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Offa died and Eadberht, &quot;who was by another name Præn&quot;, took possession of Kent. Eadberht had apparently previously been in exile on the continent under the protection of Charlemagne, and his rebellion has been seen as serving Frankish interests.

The pro-Mercian Archbishop of Canterbury, Æthelhard, fled during the rebellion. Cœnwulf of Mercia was engaged in correspondence with Pope Leo III at this time concerning the situation of the Church in England, and in the course of this Leo accepted a Mercian reconquest of Kent and excommunicated Eadberht, on the grounds that he was a former priest. Having received papal approval, Cœnwulf reconquered Kent. He placed his brother in charge and captured Eadberht in 798. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Cœnwulf &quot;ravaged over Kent and captured Eadberht Præn, their king, and led him bound into Mercia.&quot; A later addition to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; says that Eadberht was blinded and had his hands cut off, but Roger of Wendover states that he was set free by Coenwulf at some point as an act of clemency.

<text>Labanotation (grammatically correct form &quot;Labannotation&quot; or &quot;Laban notation&quot; is uncommon) is a system for analyzing and recording human movement (notation system), invented by Austro-Hungarian choreographer and dancer Rudolf von Laban (1879–1958, a central figure in European modern dance), who developed his notation on movements in the 1920s.

==History==
Laban&#x27;s first book on the subject was published in German in 1928 called Schrifttanz (Written Dance); a similar version in French and English appeared in 1930. A few years later Laban&#x27;s interest turned to other matters and he gave his notation system to the world. The German dancer, choreographer and pedagogue Albrecht Knust, who by 1930 had together with Laban&#x27;s daughter Azra (Azraela) established the &quot;Tanz-Schreib-Stube&quot; (the first Dance Notation Bureau), was the first-ever full-time kinetographer-movement notator. Between 1946 and 1950 Knust wrote his major work Das Handbuch der Kinetographie Laban (The Manual of Kinetography Laban) in eight-volumes in German, typed carbon copies appeared in 1951 in English. Ann Hutchinson Guest and former student of Sigurd Leeder, studied the system differences among and between the various practitioners taught by former Laban student Irma Betz, and had the opportunity to confer with Laban, Knust and Leeder personally on movement details and ideas, developed it further naming it Labanotation. The two systems differ somewhat.

Laban&#x27;s notation system is used as a type of dance notation in other applications including Laban Movement Analysis, robotics and human movement simulation. With Labanotation, any form of human movement can be recorded: The basis is natural human movement, every change must be noted.

This notation system could be used to describe movement in terms of spatial models and concepts, which contrasts with other movement notation systems based on anatomical analysis, letter codes, stick figures, music notes, track systems, or word notes. The system precisely and accurately portrays temporal patterns, actions, floor plans, body parts and a three-dimensional use of space. Laban&#x27;s notation system eventually evolved into modern-day Labanotation and Kinetography Laban.

Labanotation and Kinetography Laban evolved separately in the 1930s through 1950s, Labanotation in the United States and England, and Kinetography Laban in Germany and other European countries. As a result of their different evolutionary paths, Kinetography Laban hasn&#x27;t changed significantly since inception, whereas Labanotation evolved over time to meet new needs. For example, at the behest of members of the Dance Notation Bureau, the Labanotation system was expanded to allow it to convey the motivation or meaning behind movements. Kinetography Laban practitioners, on the other hand, tend to work within the constraints of the existing notation system, using spatial description alone to describe movement.

The International Council of Kinetography Laban was created in 1959 to clarify, standardize and eliminate differences between Labanotation and Kinetography Laban. Thanks to this, one or both are currently used throughout the world almost interchangeably, and are readable to practitioners of either system.

==Main concepts==
Labanotation uses abstract symbols to define the:
* Direction and level of the movement
* Part of the body doing the movement
* Duration of the movement
* Dynamic quality of the movement

===Direction and level of the movement===
The shapes of the direction symbols indicate nine different directions in space and the shading of the symbol specifies the level of the movement.

Each &quot;direction symbol&quot; indicates the orientation of a line between the proximal and distal points of a body part or a limb. That is, &quot;the direction signs indicate the direction towards which the limbs must incline&quot;.

The direction symbols are organized as three levels: high, middle, and low (or deep):

===Part of the body doing the movement===

Labanotation is a record of the facts, the framework of the movement, so that it can be reproduced.

The symbols are placed on a vertical staff, the horizontal dimension of the staff represents the symmetry of the body, and the vertical dimension represents time passing by.

The location of a symbol on the staff defines the body part it represents. The centre line of the staff represents the centre line of the body, symbols on the right represent the right side of the body, symbols on the left, the left side.

===Duration of the movement===
The staff is read from bottom to top and the length of a symbol defines the duration of the movement. Drawing on western music notation, Labanotation uses bar lines to mark the measures and double bar lines at the start and end of the movement score. The starting position of the dancer can be given before the double bar lines at the start of the score.

Movement is indicated as &quot;the transition from one point to the next&quot;, that is as one &quot;directional destination&quot; to the next.

Spatial distance, spatial relationships, transference of weight, centre of weight, turns, body parts, paths, and floor plans can all be notated by specific symbols. Jumps are indicated by an absence of any symbol in the support column, indicating that no part of the body is touching the floor.

===Dynamic quality of the movement===

The dynamic quality is often indicated through the use of effort signs (see Laban Movement Analysis).

The four effort categories are
* Space: Direct / Indirect
* Weight: Strong / Light
* Time: Sudden / Sustained
* Flow: Bound / Free

Dynamics in Labanotation are also indicated through a set of symbols indicating a rise or lowering of energy resulting from physical or emotional motive, e.g. physically forceful versus an intense emotional state.

===Motif notation===
Motif description, or the preferred term &#x27;Motif notation&#x27;, is closely related to Labanotation in its use of the same family of symbols and terminology. Labanotation is used for a literal, detailed description of movement so it can be reproduced as it was created or performed. In contrast, Motif Notation highlights core elements and leitmotifs depicting the overall structure or essential elements of a movement sequence. It can be used to set a structure for dance improvisation or for an educational exploration of movement concepts. Not limited to dance, Motif Notation can be used to direct one&#x27;s focus when learning to swing a golf club, the primary features of a character in a play, or the intent of a person&#x27;s movement in a therapy session.

<text>Public Law 280 is a federal law of the United States that changes legal jurisdiction on Indian lands and over Indian persons. The law transfers some jurisdiction from the federal government to states in both civil and criminal cases in certain places. It was passed in 1953.

There are 574 federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States, up from 562 when the law was passed. 39% of these are in Alaska; the rest in the continental US. This law covered a little more than 300 tribes when it took effect. 

In 1968, the law was amended so that states had to have the consent of the tribes to assume jurisdiction from federal government. Where states had already assumed jurisdiction, jurisdiction would retrocede to the federal government if the tribes requested it. Nearly 30 tribes were involved in retrocession. Also in 1968 the Indian Civil Rights Act was passed, causing funding to begin rising for tribal justice systems. Funding increased from $1.5 million in 1972 to $10 million in 1990. In 2010, the Tribal Law and Order Act was enacted with the goal of decreasing crime against indigenous women and children.

The Act mandated a transfer of federal law enforcement authority within certain tribal nations to state governments in six states: California, Minnesota (except the Red Lake Nation and Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe), Nebraska, Oregon (except the Warm Springs Reservation), Wisconsin (except later the Menominee Indian Reservation) and, upon its statehood, Alaska. There are currently 6 mandatory P.L. 280 states which are the listed above. Mandatory states did not get the option to refuse the jurisdiction granted by P.L. 280 whereas the ten additional states listed below, had the option of adopting this policy. These states include, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Washington. Not all of these states adopted full jurisdiction within their state. The federal government offered little assistance to either the states or tribes in the transfer of jurisdiction. Arizona, Florida, Iowa, South Dakota and Utah are the only optional states that have not receded any of their P.L. 280 jurisdiction. Optional P.L. 280 states did not need consent from tribes in order to enact full or partial jurisdiction of this law.

The Act added to a complex matrix of jurisdictional conflict that defined tribal governance at the end of the 20th century. In various states, local police, tribal police, BIA police, and the FBI are the arms of a law enforcement system that enforces laws of tribes, states and the federal government. The Act also added that tribe cannot put non-natives on trial, even when crime occurs on reservation land.

Under the Act, states, local sheriffs and state law enforcement agencies take tribal members to state courts for prosecution in cases arising from criminal matters within reservation boundaries. But most tribal governments and pueblos have also adopted their own codes, and administer court systems to adjudicate violations of the code.

In states where the Act has not been applied, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) police respond to major crimes on reservations or pueblos. The FBI joins in investigations of the most serious criminal matters such as murders or kidnappings. In those states, when allegations against tribal members arise from crimes on a reservation, the United States Attorney cites violations of the United States Code in a United States district court. Tribal and pueblo police also enforce local codes in &quot;non-PL 280&quot; states.

The law protects individuals from dealing with federal prosecution on tribal land but with that comes less tribal sovereignty for the indigenous nations that are affected by P.L. 280. After the change in jurisdiction there were some issues that came forth from state legislation that led to less funding. When tribal communities voiced their concerns and criticisms of the P.L. 280, they were often met with hostility from states. Since tribal communities lost a majority of their funding from the federal government, the states&#x27; capabilities were stretched thin. They were now asked to perform duties out of their area of expertise with the same funding they were receiving. This led to criticism from local agencies because they were unaware of their jurisdictional duties surrounding tribal communities. With neither the state or tribal communities receiving funding for this change in legislature we began to see tribal communities suffer economically, which also led to an increase in crime rates.

==Impact==

Very few research studies have been conducted to make a conclusion on the impact of the law on tribal land across the nation. There are questions about its effectiveness on criminal behavior and socioeconomic impact to the affected tribes. Studies that have been done have shown that the law has led to an increase in crime and has slowed the economic growth of some reservations. Native women and children have suffered disproportionately as victims of crime because of PL 280.

<text>The córdoba (, sign: C$; code: NIO) is the currency of Nicaragua and is divided into 100 &quot;centavos&quot;.

== History ==
The first córdoba was introduced with the new National Bank of Nicaragua (Banco Nacional de Nicaragua Incorporado) which was created in 1912, after which the government of Adolfo Díaz promulgated the Monetary Conversion Law, in March 1912. This law created the monetary unit &quot;córdoba&quot;, named after Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, founder of Nicaragua and the cities of León and Granada, but due to the prevailing political instability at that time, the Córdoba did not circulate until 1913. It replaced the peso moneda corriente, the Nicaraguan currency between 1878 and 1912.

In 1960 the Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) was founded and the banknotes and coins that until that date were issued by the National Bank of Nicaragua, began to be issued by the central bank.

From 1979 onwards, a period characterised by high inflation began, which caused the currency to lose value and led to the currency exchange and conversion operation of 14 February 1988, in which the córdoba, under the Sandinista regime&#x27;s &quot;Operation Berta&quot; (Operación Berta), was replaced by the &quot;new córdoba&quot; (córdoba nuevo) at an exchange rate of 1,000 to 1. In the period 1988-1990, the period of high inflation continued, which led to the córdoba nuevo being replaced by the córdoba oro, with parity against the US dollar. In 1992, the &quot;cordoba&quot; was established and persists to this day.

== Coins ==

=== First córdoba ===
In 1912, coins were introduced in denominations of , 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos and 1 córdoba. The and 1 centavo were minted in bronze, the 5 centavos in cupro-nickel and the higher denominations in silver. The 1 córdoba was only minted in 1912, whilst centavo production ceased in 1937.

In 1939, cupro-nickel replaced silver on the 10, 25, and 50 centavos. In 1943, a single year issue of brass 1, 5, 10, and 25 centavos was made. These were the last 1 centavo coins. In 1972, cupro-nickel 1 córdoba coins were issued, followed, in 1974, by aluminium 5 and 10 centavos.

A new series of coins, featuring a portrait of Augusto César Sandino, was introduced in 1981, consisting of aluminum 5 and 10 centavos, nickel-clad steel 25 centavos and cupro-nickel 50 centavos, 1 and 5 córdobas. Nickel clad steel replaced cupro nickel between 1983 and 1984. In 1987, the final coins of the 1st córdoba were issued, featuring Sandino&#x27;s characteristic hat. Aluminum 500 córdobas were issued.

The 25 and 50 centavo coins, along with 1 córdoba coins, minted in 1985 were mostly recalled and destroyed by the Central Bank. A few of the 1 córdoba were circulated as seen.

=== Second córdoba ===

No coins were issued for this currency.

=== Third córdoba (córdoba oro) ===

In 1991, coins dated 1987 but actually introduced with that year&#x27;s re-denomination, in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 centavos and aluminum-bronze 50 centavos. 1 and 5 córdobas were issued.

In 1994, coins were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos. All were minted in chrome-plated steel. In 1997, nickel-clad steel 50 centavos, 1 and 5 córdobas were introduced, followed by copper-plated steel 5 centavos and brass-plated steel 10 and 25 centavos in 2002 and brass-plated steel 10 córdobas in 2007.


In 2012, the Central Bank issued a 5 Córdobas coin to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the Córdoba.
== Banknotes ==

=== First córdoba ===
In 1912, the National Bank of Nicaragua introduced notes for 10, 25, and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 córdobas, together with old half- and 1-peso moneda corriente notes overprinted for 4 and 8 centavos of the new currency. In 1934, all circulating banknotes were exchanged for notes which had been overprinted with &quot;REVALIDO&quot; (&quot;revalidated&quot;). The last notes for less than 1 córdoba were dated 1938. In 1945, 500-córdoba notes were introduced, followed by 1,000-córdoba notes in 1953.
In 1962, the Central Bank of Nicaragua took over paper money issuance by a bank resolution of 8 February 1962 and executive decree No. 71 of 26 April 1962. The 1-córdoba notes were replaced by coins in 1972. After 5-córdoba coins were introduced in 1981, 2 and 5-córdoba notes were withdrawn. In 1987, 5000-córdoba notes were introduced, followed by overprinted 10,000 (on 10), 20,000 (on 20), 50,000 (on 50), 100,000 (on 100), 100,000 (on 500), 200,000 (on 1,000), 500,000 (on 1,000), and 1,000,000 (on 1,000) córdobas notes as inflation drastically reduced the córdoba&#x27;s value.

=== Second córdoba ===

The second córdoba was only issued in banknote form. Notes (dated 1985) were issued in 1988 in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 córdobas together with undated 5000 córdobas. In 1989, notes for 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 córdobas were introduced, followed the next year by 200,000, 500,000, 1 million, 5 million, and 10 million córdobas notes.

=== Third córdoba (córdoba oro) ===
In 1991, notes were introduced for 1, 5, 10, and 25 centavos, , 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 córdobas. The notes below 1 córdoba were replaced by coins in 1994, with 5 córdobas notes also being replaced in 1997. 500 córdobas notes were introduced in 2002.

Famous people from Nicaragua&#x27;s history are depicted on the obverses of the current banknotes. The reverses depict landmarks or natural habitats in the country.


=== 2009 series ===

On May 15, 2009, polymer ten and twenty córdoba notes were issued to circulate alongside their paper counterparts. A new polymer two hundred and a paper one hundred córdoba banknote was first issued on June 1, 2009. A new polymer 50 córdoba was issued on December 3, 2009. The new designed paper 500 córdoba banknote was introduced on January 12, 2010. A commemorative design of the 50 córdobas was introduced on September 15, 2010, to commemorate the Banco Central de Nicaragua&#x27;s 50th anniversary of its establishment. In 2012, the Banco Central de Nicaragua (Central Bank of Nicaragua) began issuing a new series of córdoba banknotes with revised security features, beginning with the 10, 20, and 200 córdoba polymer banknotes, which is similar to their first issue, but the notable change is the embossed &quot;10&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, and &quot;200&quot; on the see-through window now being of an opaque white.
The 100 córdoba banknote was also revised. The notable differences from the first issue is that the note was issued on the 100th anniversary of the córdoba currency. Also notable is the wider security thread, a revised registration device, a repositioned serial number, subtle underprint design changes and the commemorative text &quot;1912-2012 Centenario del Cordoba&quot; in pearlescent ink at the left front of the note. The 500 córdoba banknote was also revised. The most notable change for the note is the bank logo patch, now a holographic patch instead of an optically variable device and a wider security thread.
=== 2015 and 2017 series ===
On 26 October 2015, the Banco Central de Nicaragua introduced a new family of banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Córdobas. The six lower denominations are printed in polymer, while the 500 Córdobas note is printed on cotton paper substrate. On 1 December 2016, the Banco Central de Nicaragua introduced a 1,000 Córdobas banknote to ease high-value transactions. A commemorative design was issued on 1 December 2016 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of poet Rubén Darío and a regular issue was issued on 2 January 2017.

In July 2019, the 500 and 1000 Córdoba banknotes were reissued in polymer, to circulate in parallel with existing issues.
==Exchange rate==
In 1991, the Central Bank of Nicaragua established a crawling peg scheme in accordance with FMI exchange rate policies with a 12% annual rate of devaluation; , this scheme continued to devalue the córdoba against the United States dollar by 5% per annum and decrease further at 3% per annum, subsecuently.

<text>John Purroy Mitchel (July 19, 1879 – July 6, 1918) was the 95th mayor of New York, in office from 1914 to 1917. At 34, he was the second-youngest mayor of the city, and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Boy Mayor of New York&quot;. Mitchel won the 1913 mayoral election in a landslide, but lost the Republican primary in 1917 and came in second place in the general election as an Independent. He is remembered for his short career as leader of anti-Tammany Hall reform politics in New York, as well as for his early death as an Army Air Service officer during a training flight in Louisiana amid World War I.

Mitchel was praised by reformists in New York. Journalist Oswald Garrison Villard, the editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, called him &quot;the ablest and best Mayor New York ever had.&quot; Former President Theodore Roosevelt, endorsing Mitchel&#x27;s re-election bid in 1917, stated that he had &quot;given us as nearly an ideal administration of the New York City government as I have seen in my lifetime.&quot; However, he is generally held to have been ineffective as a politician.

Mitchel&#x27;s later staunchly Roman Catholic New York family had been founded by his paternal grandfather and namesake, John Mitchel, an Ulster Presbyterian Young Irelander who became a renowned writer and leader in the Irish nationalist movement, as well as a staunch supporter of the Confederacy.

==Early life==
John Purroy Mitchel was born on July 19, 1879, in Fordham, the Bronx, to James Mitchel, a New York City fire marshal, and Mary Purroy, who worked as a schoolteacher until her marriage. James had served in the Confederate States Army, as did two of his brothers who died in action during the Civil War. James was a Presbyterian Irish-American, the son of Irish nationalist writer John Mitchel. 

John&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Venezuelan-born Juan Bautista Purroy, was that country&#x27;s consul in New York, which made Mitchel the first Mayor of New York City of Hispanic descent. Mitchel&#x27;s great-grandfather, José Joaquin de Purroy, was a lawyer from Spain who settled in Venezuela. The Purroy family also included leading politicians in the Bronx.

John graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in the late 1890s, obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Columbia College in 1899 and graduating from New York Law School in 1902 with honors. Mitchel then pursued a career as a private attorney.

==Early career==
In December 1906, Mitchel was hired by family friend and New York City corporation counsel William B. Ellison to investigate the office of John F. Ahearn, borough president of Manhattan, leading to Ahearn&#x27;s dismissal. Mitchel began his career as assistant corporation counsel and then became a member of the Commissioners of Accounts, from which he investigated city departments. Mitchel gained results and recognition for his thorough and professional investigations into various city departments and high-ranking officials. Mitchel, with the help of Henry Bruere and other staff members of the Bureau of Municipal Research turned the insignificant Commissioners of Accounts into an administration of importance.

The young Mitchel&#x27;s reputation as a reformer earned him the support of anti-Tammany Hall forces in local politics. In 1909, Mitchel was elected president of the Board of Aldermen. As president of the board of aldermen, Mitchel was able to enact fiscal reforms, cutting waste and improving accounting practices. He unsuccessfully fought for a municipally-owned transit system, and voted against allowing the Interborough Rapid Transit and Brooklyn Rapid Transit companies permission to extend their existing subway and elevated lines. Mitchel served as acting mayor for a six-week period in 1910, after incumbent William Jay Gaynor was shot. His biggest accomplishment during his short tenure was the act of neutrality during a garment industry strike.

==Political career==
=== Mayoral campaign ===

As the 1913 mayoral election approached, the Citizens Municipal Committee of 107 set out to find a candidate that would give New York &quot;a non-partisan, efficient and progressive government.&quot; They were assisted in this endeavor by the Fusion Executive Committee, led by Joseph M. Price of the City Club of New York. After nine ballots, Mitchel was nominated as a candidate for mayor. During his campaign, Mitchel focused on modernizing and fighting corruption in the city government.

At the age of 34, Mitchel was elected mayor on the Republican Party slate in a landslide. He defeated Democratic candidate Edward E. McCall by 121,000 votes, thus becoming the second youngest mayor of New York City; he was often referred to as the &quot;Boy Mayor of New York.&quot;

===Tenure as mayor===

Mitchel&#x27;s administration introduced widespread reforms, particularly in the New York City Police Department as overseen by Police Commissioner Arthur Woods. Woods fought corruption in the department and increased its efficiency and scope in attacking crime. His administration was neutral during garment and transportation worker&#x27;s strikes in 1916.

At 1:30 P.M., on April 17, 1914, Michael P. Mahoney fired a gun at Mitchel as the mayor was getting in his car. The bullet ricocheted off a pedestrian and hit Frank Lyon Polk, New York City&#x27;s corporation counsel, in the chin.

Mitchel&#x27;s early popularity was soon diminished due to his fiscal policies and vision of education. Mitchel was heavily criticized for combining vocational and academic courses in the Gary Plan, and began to trim the size of the Board of Education and attempted to control teachers&#x27; salaries. While Mitchel was a Catholic, he alienated that voting bloc by his investigation into corruption in Catholic charities. 

Mitchel advocated for universal military training to prepare for war. In a speech at Princeton University on March 1, 1917, he described universal military training as &quot;the [only] truly democratic solution to the problem of preparedness on land.&quot; These positions alienated New Yorkers, who felt he focused on military patriotism over politics.

Mitchel ran again for mayor in the highly charged wartime election of 1917. His reelection campaign suffered, as many New Yorkers felt he cared more about American involvement in World War I, socializing with the city&#x27;s elite, and fiscal management than local issues. He narrowly lost the Republican primary to William M. Bennett after a contentious recount, but then ran for re-election as a pro-war Fusion candidate.

Mitchel&#x27;s campaign focused on wartime patriotism, with a media campaign that denounced Germans, Irish, and Jews as unpatriotic sympathizers with the enemy cause. Mitchel faced Bennett, anti-war Socialist Morris Hillquit, and Tammany Hall Democrat John F. Hylan in the general election; Hylan, whose campaign was sharply critical of Mitchel, won in a landslide without taking a clear position on the war, while Mitchel barely finished in second place ahead of Hillquit.

==Death==
After losing re-election, Mitchel joined the Army Air Service as a flying cadet, completing training in San Diego and obtaining the rank of major. On the morning of July 6, 1918, while returning from a short military training flight to Gerstner Field near Lake Charles, Louisiana, his plane suddenly went into a nosedive, causing him to fall from his plane due to an unfastened seatbelt. Mitchel plummeted to his death, his body landing in a marsh about 0.5 miles south of the field.

Mitchel&#x27;s body was returned to New York City. His funeral was held at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan, and he was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx on July 11, 1918.

==Legacy==
Historian Mark D. Hirsch has said of Mitchel&#x27;s tenure as mayor: He was one of the ablest mayors in the judgments of many and provided an outstanding administration, but was exasperatingly guilty of every blunder that could be attributed to youthful stubbornness, unnecessary asperity, and poor judgment both by himself and his advisers.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois Chicago ranked Mitchel as the seventeenth-worst American big-city mayor to have served since 1820.

Mitchel Air Force Base on Long Island was named for him in 1918. A bronze memorial plaque with Mitchel&#x27;s likeness is affixed between the two stone pylons at the western end of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University. A plaque of his likeness is located on an entrance to the base of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir jogging track in Central Park.

The Fire Department of New York operated a fireboat named &quot;John Purroy Mitchel&quot; from 1921 to 1966.

American singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom&#x27;s 2015 song &quot;Sapokanikan&quot; references Mitchel and the circumstances of his death.

<text>Dance notation is the symbolic representation of human dance movement and form, using methods such as graphic symbols and figures, path mapping, numerical systems, and letter and word notations. Several dance notation systems have been invented, many of which are designed to document specific types of dance while others have been developed with capturing the broader spectrum of human movement potential. A &quot;dance score&quot; is a recorded dance notation that describes a particular dance.

== Usage ==

The primary uses of dance notation are historical dance preservation through documentation and analysis (e.g., in ethnochoreology) or reconstruction of choreography, dance forms, and technical exercises. Dance notation systems also allow for dance works to be documented and therefore potentially copyrighted.

Two popular dance notation systems used in Western culture are Labanotation (also known as Kinetography Laban) and Benesh Movement Notation. Others include Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation and DanceWriting.

Many dance notation systems are designed for specific types of dance. Some examples include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from Israel, Morris Dance Notation for Morris dance, and Beauchamp–Feuillet Notation for Baroque dance. As a result, these systems usually cannot effectively describe other types of dance.

== History ==

In the 1680s, Pierre Beauchamp invented a dance notation system for Baroque dance. His system, known as Beauchamp–Feuillet notation, was published in 1700 by Raoul Auger Feuillet and used to record dances throughout the eighteenth century.

A well-known collection of dance scores is the Sergeyev Collection, recorded using Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov&#x27;s notation method (1892). This collection documents the Imperial Ballet&#x27;s (today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) repertoire from the turn of the 20th century, including Marius Petipa&#x27;s original choreographic designs for &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Le Corsaire&quot;, and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, as well as &quot;Coppélia&quot; and the original version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. It was with this collection that many of these works were first staged outside Russia.

In 1934, the composer Joseph Schillinger created a highly accurate notation system based on the 3D bone rotation and translation of a moving dancer. With motion capture technology half a century in the future, there was no way to effectively measure and record this information at the time.

In 1948, Hanya Holm became the first Broadway choreographer to have her dance scores copyrighted, for her work on &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;.

In 1951, Stanley D. Kahn published Kahnotation, a dance notation system specific to tap dance.

In 1956, Rudolf and Joan Benesh first published Benesh Movement Notation, a written system for recording human movement. It is most widely used in the recording and restaging of dance works.

In 1958, Eshkol and Wachman published an exposition of their movement notation.

In 1969, Romanian choreographer Theodor Vasilescu published a dance notation system for Romanian folk dances.

In the 1970s, North Korean choreographer U Chang-sop developed a system of dance notation for Korean dance called the Chamo System of Dance Notation, which uses pictorially based symbols.

In 1975, Ann Hutchinson Guest reconstructed choreographer Arthur Saint-Léon&#x27;s &quot;Pas de Six&quot; from his 1844 ballet &quot;La Vivandière&quot;, along with its original music by composer Cesare Pugni, for the Joffrey Ballet. The piece was reconstructed from Saint-Léon&#x27;s work, which was documented using his own method of dance notation, known as &quot;La Sténochorégraphie&quot;.

In 1982, the first computerized notation system—the &quot;DOM&quot; (Dance on Microprocessor) dance notation system—was created by Eddie Dombrower for Apple II computers. The system displayed an animated figure on the screen that performed dance moves specified by the choreographer.

In 2017, Felipe Hsieh created Tango Notation, a dance notation system specific to Argentine tango.

<doc id="482682" wikidata="Q609792" url="?curid=482682" title="Junkers Ju 390">
<text>The Junkers Ju 390 was a German long-range derivative of the Junkers Ju 290 aircraft, intended to be used as a heavy transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft and long-range bomber. It was one of the aircraft designs submitted for the abortive &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project, along with the Messerschmitt Me 264, the Focke-Wulf Ta 400 and the Heinkel He 277.

==Design and development==
Two prototypes were created by attaching an extra pair of inner-wing segments to the wings of Ju 290 airframes and adding new sections to lengthen the fuselages. The first prototype, V1 (bearing &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; code of GH+UK), was modified from the Ju 90 V6 airframe (Werknummer J4918, civil registration D-AOKD from July 1940 to April 1941, then to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as KH+XC from April 1941 to April 1942, then returned to Junkers and used for Ju 390 V1 construction). It made its maiden flight on 20 October 1943 and performed well, resulting in an order in early 1944 for six more prototypes (Ju 390 V2 to V7) and 20 examples of the intended production version. to be named Ju 390 A-1. None of these had been built by the time that the project was cancelled (along with Ju 290 production) in mid-1944.

==Operational history==
The Ju 390 V1 was constructed and largely assembled at Junkers&#x27; plant at Dessau in Germany and the first test flight took place on 20 October 1943. This was done by adding an additional wing section and engines and adding a fuselage section immediately aft of the wings to increase the length to 31 m (102 ft). Its performance was satisfactory enough that the Air Ministry ordered six additional prototypes (Ju 390 V2 to V7) and 20 examples of the intended Ju 390A-1 production version. On 29 June 1944, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Quartermaster General noted that the RLM paid Junkers to complete the first seven Ju 390 prototypes. The contracts for the Ju 390 V2 to V7 and production aircraft were cancelled on 20 June 1944 and all work ceased in September 1944, and the Ju 390 V2 would never be built. On 26 November 1943, the Ju 390 V1 — with many other new aircraft and prototypes — was shown to Adolf Hitler at Insterburg, East Prussia. According to the logbook of former Junkers test pilot Hans-Joachim Pancherz, the Ju 390 V1 was brought to Prague immediately after it had been displayed at Insterburg and took part in a number of test flights, which continued until March 1944, including tests of aerial refueling. The Ju 390 V1 was returned to Dessau in November 1944, where it was stripped of parts and finally destroyed in late April 1945 as the US Army approached.

The Ju 390A-1 would have had a fuselage longer than that of the Ju 390 V1 for a total of length of 33.5 m (110 ft) and it was to be equipped with FuG 200 Hohentwiel ASV (Air to Surface Vessel) radar and defensive armament consisting of five 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon. Green (1970) wrote that the armament was four 20 mm MG 151/20s and three 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. At a hearing before British authorities on 26 September 1945, Professor Heinrich Hertel, chief designer and technical director of Junkers Aircraft &amp; Motor Works, asserted the Ju 390 V2 had never been completed. German author Friedrich Georg claimed in his book that test pilot &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Joachim Eisermann flew the Ju 390 V2 on 9 February 1945 at Rechlin air base. The log is said to have recorded a handling flight lasting 50 minutes and composed of circuits around Rechlin, and that a second 20-minute flight was used to ferry the prototype to Lärz. Kay (2004) stated that the second Ju 390 prototype was discarded without being flown because of a July 1944 RLM decree sanctioning an end to all large combat plane programs in Nazi Germany in favor of the Emergency Fighter Program. Pancherz himself stated in 1980 that only the first Ju 390 flew and cast doubt on all claims of the Ju 390 making a test flight to the vicinity of New York City.

==Alleged flights==
===South Africa flight===
A speculative article in the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper in 1969 titled &quot;Lone Bomber Raid on New York Planned by Hitler&quot;, in which Hans Pancherz reportedly claimed to have made a test flight from Germany to Cape Town in early 1944. Author James P. Duffy has carried out extensive research into this claim, which has proved fruitless.

===New York flight===
A letter published in the 11 November 1955 issue of the British magazine &quot;RAF Flying Review (&quot;of which aviation writer William Green was an editor) claimed that two Ju 390s had made a flight to America, including a one-hour stay over New York City. The magazine&#x27;s editors were skeptical of the claim. In March 1956, the Review published a letter from an RAF officer which claimed to clarify the account. According to Green&#x27;s reporting, in June 1944, Allied Intelligence had learned from prisoner interrogations that a Ju 390 had been delivered in January 1944 to &quot;Fernaufklärungsgruppe&quot; 5, based at Mont-de-Marsan near Bordeaux and that it had completed a 32-hour reconnaissance flight to within of the U.S. coast, north of New York City. This was rejected just after the war by British authorities. Aviation historian Dr. Kenneth P. Werrell states that the story of the flight originated in &quot;General Report on Aircraft Engines and Aircraft Equipment&quot;, two British intelligence reports from August 1944, which were based in part on the interrogation of prisoners. The reports claimed that the Ju 390 had taken photographs of the coast of Long Island but no photos or other evidence for the existence of such photos has been found.

The claimed flight was mentioned in many books following the &quot;RAF Flying Review&quot; account, including Green&#x27;s respected &quot;Warplanes of the Second World War&quot; (1968) and &quot;Warplanes of the Third Reich&quot; (1970) but without ever citing sources. Further authors then cited Green&#x27;s books as their source for the claimed flight. Werrell told Duffy that Green had said many years later that he no longer placed &quot;much credence&quot; in the flight. Werrell later examined the data regarding the range of the Ju 390 and concluded that although a great circle round trip from France to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland was possible, adding another for a round trip from St. John&#x27;s to Long Island made the flight &quot;most unlikely&quot;.

Karl Kössler and Günter Ott, in their book &quot;Die großen Dessauer: Junkers Ju 89, 90, 290, 390. Die Geschichte einer Flugzeugfamilie&quot; (The Big Dessauers... History of an Aircraft Family) also examined the claimed flight and debunked the flight north of New York. Assuming there was only one aircraft in existence, Kössler and Ott note it was nowhere near France at the time when the flight was supposed to have taken place. They also assert that the Ju 390 V1 was unlikely to have been capable of taking off with the fuel load necessary for such a long flight due to concerns about the strength of its structure; it would have required a takeoff weight of , while the maximum takeoff weight during its trials had been though prototypes are never flown at maximum gross weight until testing can determine the aircraft&#x27;s handling. According to Kössler and Ott, the Ju 390 V2 could not have made the flight since it was not completed before September/October 1944.

===Japan flight===
In his book &quot;The Bunker&quot;, author James P. O&#x27;Donnell mentions a flight to Japan. O&#x27;Donnell claimed that Albert Speer, in an early 1970s telephone interview, stated that there had been a secret Ju 390 flight to Japan &quot;late in the war&quot;. The flight, by a Luftwaffe test pilot, had supposedly been non-stop via the polar route. O&#x27;Donnell is the sole source for the story; Speer never mentioned the story in any of his writings or other interviews. Kössler and Ott make no mention of the claim.

<text>Bent (sometimes stylised as BENT) is a 1979 British-American play by Martin Sherman. It revolves around the persecution of gays in Nazi Germany, and takes place during and after the Night of the Long Knives.

The title of the play refers to the slang word &quot;bent&quot; used in some European countries to refer to homosexuals. When the play was first performed, there was only a trickle of historical research or even awareness about the Nazi persecution of homosexuals. In some regards, the play helped increase that historical research and education in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Plot==
Maximilian Berber (Max), a promiscuous gay man in 1930s Berlin, is at odds with his wealthy family because of his homosexuality. One evening, much to the resentment of his boyfriend Rudolph Hennings (Rudy), he brings home a handsome Sturmabteilung man, Wolfgang Granz (Wolf). Unfortunately, it is the night that Hitler orders the assassination of the upper echelon of the Sturmabteilung corps, to consolidate his power. Wolf is discovered the next morning and killed by SS men in Max and Rudy&#x27;s apartment, and the two have to flee their home.

They seek counsel from Rudy&#x27;s boss Greta. Greta is a drag queen; she ran her own gay club, which is newly shut down (implicitly due to, at the time, new Paragraph 175 enforcements). Greta explains that the SS approached her for information about Wolf, and that she took them to Max and Rudy&#x27;s apartment. She officially fires Rudy and hands Max the finder&#x27;s fee she earned from the SS. They leave the club and Berlin behind.

Max&#x27;s uncle Freddie, who is also gay, but lives a more discreet life with rent boys to satisfy his desires, has organized new papers for Max to flee to France where homosexuality is legal, but Max refuses to leave Rudy behind. As a result, Max and Rudy are found in a forest tent-colony and arrested by the Gestapo. They are forced to board a train headed for Dachau concentration camp.

On the train, Rudy is spotted wearing glasses by an officer. The officer makes Rudy crush his glasses, and then orders Rudy to be taken, presumably to be killed for his poor eyesight. Rudy is beaten within an inch of his life, all the while Max tries to ignore his screams. Another prisoner on the train, wearing a pink triangle patch, explains the patch system during the Holocaust to Max and tells Max that he must show no sentiment towards Rudy. The officer has Rudy taken back to Max and coerces Max to beat Rudy to death. Max is taken by the guards and lies to them, telling them that he is a Jew rather than a homosexual, because he believes his chances for survival in the camp will be better if he is not assigned the pink triangle. Max later confesses, to the same prisoner from the train, that the guards then forced him to have intercourse with the body of a dead pre-teen girl to &quot;prove&quot; he was not homosexual. That prisoner reveals their name is Horst.

In the camp, Max makes friends with Horst, who shows him the dignity that lies in acknowledging what one is. They fall in love and become lovers through their imagination and through their words. After Horst is shot by camp guards, Max puts on Horst&#x27;s jacket with the pink triangle and commits suicide by grabbing an electric fence.

==Premiere==
Bent premiered in London in 1979 at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, London, the production later transferring to the West End. Ian McKellen played Max and Tom Bell played Horst.

*1980 – &quot;Bent&quot; was premièred in French at Le Théâtre de Poche in Brussels (Belgium) in January 1980, in a French translation by Lena Grinda, directed by Derek Goldby, with Alain Libolt, Jean-Pierre Dauzun, Yves Deguenne, Pierre Dumaine, Fabrice Eberhard, Bernard Graczyk, Thomas Hutereau, Jean Couvrin, Tobias Kempf, and Roland Mahauden. There was a rerun in September 1998.
*1980 – In April the play was staged in Germany for the first time at the Nationaltheater in Mannheim
*1981 – The first production in Brazil was in 1981, at Teatro Villa Lobos (Rio de Janeiro) with José Mayer (Max), Tonico Pereira (Horst), Ricardo Blat (Rudy), and Paulo César Grande. In spite of the fact that Brazil was then a military dictatorship, Sherman&#x27;s text was presented uncensored.
*1981 – The first Canadian production of &quot;Bent&quot; was in 1981 at the Bathurst Street Theatre, Toronto, Ontario, in English; it starred Richard Monette as Max, Brent Carver as Horst and Jeff Wincott as Wolf/Kapo.
*1983 – In Israel, the play was first produced in 1983, and has since been revived on five occasions, most recently in 2018, at the Israeli National Habima Theatre. It reportedly caused riots in Israel, due to the controversial subject matter.
*1989 – Sean Mathias directed a revival of the play, performed as a one-night benefit for Stonewall, featuring Ian McKellen, Richard E Grant, Ian Charleson, and Ralph Fiennes. After receiving critical acclaim the one-night revival, Mathias directed a full run in 1990, with McKellen, Paul Rhys, and Christopher Eccleston, which won the City Limits Award for Revival of the Year.
*2003 – &quot;Bent&quot; was presented by Singaporean theatre company Toy Factory Theatre Ensemble, directed by Beatrice Chia.
*2009 – &quot;Bent&quot; was presented in Amarillo, Texas by AVENUE 10, causing the theater to be targeted by an anti-homosexual Christian group Repent Amarillo, who shut down the venue by tipping off local law enforcement.
* 2015 – A Polish production in a translation by Rubi Birden premiered in Warsaw Teatr Dramatyczny on 2 October 2015 starring Mariusz Drężek, Kamil Siegmund, Piotr Bulcewicz, Piotr Siwkiewicz, and Maciej Wyczański.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Slovakia on 3 April 2004, with a second round on 17 April. Although former Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar received the most votes in the first round, he was defeated by Ivan Gašparovič in the run-off.

Eduard Kukan, who had led the opinion polling prior to the elections, was surprisingly eliminated in the first round, narrowly beaten into third place by Gašparovič. Gašparovič later admitted that he had not expect to qualify for the second round, and on first round election night he had gone home to sleep and only found out about his success when he was woken up by phone calls from friends.

Incumbent president Rudolf Schuster finished fourth with just 7% of the vote. He subsequently retired from politics.

===Early years===
The Alberta Liberal Party was formed on September 1, 1905. The Liberals formed the government in Alberta for the first 16 years of the province&#x27;s existence. Alexander C. Rutherford (1905–1910), Arthur L. Sifton (1910–1917) and Charles Stewart (1917–1921) led Liberal governments, until the party was swept from office in the 1921 election by the United Farmers of Alberta.

===1921: Loss of power===

When Premier Charles Stewart resigned as leader after his government&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the United Farmers of Alberta in the 1921 election, John R. Boyle, a former Attorney-General, led the legislative caucus until he was appointed to the judiciary in 1924, and Charles R. Mitchell, also a former cabinet minister succeeded him. John C. Bowen acted in the interim until a party convention chose Joseph Tweed Shaw, a former independent left-wing M.P.

In the lead-up to the 1930 election, the party chose George H. Webster, M.L.A. for Calgary City. He resigned in favour of William R. Howson, who led the party energetically if unsuccessfully in 1935. After he was appointed to the provincial superior court in 1936, Edward Leslie Gray succeeded him.

===Unity coalition===
Discussions on a coalition of opposition forces began in the early thirties to put together a strong opposition to the United Farmers government. The Liberals refused to join when their fortunes were going up during the leadership William Howson. At the height of Liberal popularity they had managed to lure two United Farmers MLAs to sit in the Liberal caucus.

After the defeat of old line parties by Social Credit in the 1935 Alberta general election, the coalition idea picked up steam. Edward Gray, Liberal leader cautiously entered the party into the Unity Movement giving riding associations the opportunity to support Liberal candidates or Independent candidates.

The Alberta Liberals were tepid to support the Independent Citizens&#x27; Association led by John Percy Page. They wanted the Independents to remain independent and were against having a new party formed based on the coalition. The Liberals maintained the party organization by keeping the Constituency Associations and Party Executive Intact. After Gray resigned the leadership on April 19, 1941, to accept a patronage position the party did not officially replace him as leader until James Prowse in 1947.

The President of the Party who stood for election annually, became the official face of the party in all matters of party business. The party also kept a rump caucus from 1940 to 1944 that started out with one member and got to three by dissolution in 1944. The Liberals despite internal pressure to break with the coalition agreed not to run candidates in the 1944 election.

Cooperation with the Independents officially came to an end when the federal Camrose riding association passed a motion at a meeting in August 1945 calling on the executive of the provincial Liberal party to reorganize in all Alberta provincial constituencies free of alliances and arrangements with other parties.

The party held a meeting on January 7, 1946, to discuss proposals to participate in the 1948 Alberta general election.

===Post-war===
Prowse became the first true leader of the party in the post coalition era. He led the party from 1947 to 1958 leading to significant gains in popular votes and seats. He resigned the leadership to run for Mayor of Edmonton, and was succeeded by John Walter Grant MacEwan, M.L.A. for Calgary City. MacEwan was beset by problems entirely beyond his ability to control. The electoral ability of any opposition party leader became very chancy with the abolition of the STV electoral system used for Edmonton and Calgary cities.

The Manning government had successfully renewed and reinvigorated itself, and recovered much of the ground it had previously lost, while the recent Diefenbaker landslide made the Progressive Conservative Party seem a more attractive vehicle for the party&#x27;s traditional supporters.

MacEwan was the first of many leaders who faced a problem similar to those of Liberals in Britain and other Western Canadian provinces. Ideologically, the party was being squeezed between traditional conservatism and social democracy. In a social sense, the party presented an older and more traditional image in comparison to the Alberta Progressive Conservatives, who, given the predominance of Social Credit, seemed fairly liberal. Almost inevitably, the Liberals were reduced to a single member, Michael Maccagno of Lac La Biche. MacEwan retired shortly after this disaster.

===1960s===
He was succeeded by David B. Hunter, then mayor of Athabasca, who campaigned aggressively on the creation of a publicly owned electrical power company, with strong environmentalist overtones. This likely limited any growth by the Alberta New Democrats in the 1963 election, and it established the party with a distinct image and identity separate from the Progressive Conservatives. However, it was internally divisive, and a number of candidates, including one of its two successful ones, repudiated the platform&#x27;s main plank. Hunter himself was defeated personally in Athabasca. He did not resign until after he lost a later byelection, when he decided to run for Parliament (unsuccessfully).

Maccagno, who was leader of the minuscule opposition in the Legislature, served as interim leader, but did not regard himself as leadership material. In a convention which exposed the deep ideological fault lines within the party, Adrian Douglas Berry, a Calgary alderman, emerged as leader from a highly acrimonious contest. Internal dissensions continued, and late in 1966, Berry resigned under circumstances still not explained. As a provincial election could be expected within months, Maccagno became leader almost by default, and somewhat unwillingly led the party into the 1967 provincial election.

Maccagno was elected, the first Liberal leader since 1955 and the last until 1986 to achieve the feat and the party increased its representation from two to three seats. However, the party placed fourth in the popular vote. Peter Lougheed and the Progressive Conservatives presented the attraction of a modern, urban-based party which was decidedly more liberal than the Social Credit government. The Tories displaced the Liberals as the apparent alternative to the Socreds.

===Shut out===
The next four years were a bad time for the Liberals. The party placed very poorly in a byelection to replace a Liberal MLA who had died, and the party had lost its other two seats when Maccagno resigned to run in the 1968 federal election and then in November 1969, the last remaining Liberal MLA, Bill Dickie, crossed the floor to join Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, who had rapidly established themselves as a credible government-in-waiting.

In 1969, the party chose a Calgary clergyman turned businessman, John T. Lowery, to succeed Maccagno. Lowery thought he saw some hope in an electoral arrangement with Social Credit, which he believed was showing signs of modernization and rejuvenation under Manning&#x27;s successor, Harry Strom. He was likely encouraged in this by the two federal ministers from Alberta, Bud Olson and Pat Mahoney, both former Socreds. When word of negotiations to that effect came out, it became evident that any such proposal was deeply opposed by the core membership of both parties. Lowery resigned in the face of it.

The following year saw the provincial Liberals come very close to extinction. The party&#x27;s political credibility had been steadily eroding, and with the negotiations with Social Credit, it was not immediately clear that it had any ideological purpose. There was much discussion of the party abandoning provincial politics altogether (there was only one organization at federal and provincial levels), and concentrating on federal politics, which looked a great deal more hopeful at the time than they did two years later.

It took a major act of will for the party to decide to soldier on as an independent force, which it did in repudiating Lowery, and deciding to contest the 1971 election, however hopeless the prospects might be. The party chose, almost by default, Robert Russell of St. Albert, a highly controversial figure who had been passed over twice, but who had a strong desire for the position, and who had strongly supported David Hunter&#x27;s vision for the party.

The party suffered as bad a defeat as anyone could have expected in the 1971 election. It was shut out of the legislature altogether in an election that saw Social Credit defeated after 36 years in power at the hands of Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives.

It is widely argued that the provincial Liberals&#x27; popularity in Alberta was especially hurt during the federal government of Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party of Canada between 1968 and 1984. Trudeau&#x27;s policies were unpopular in western Canada and especially in Alberta, particularly official bilingualism, and the National Energy Program (NEP), which exacerbated feelings of western alienation. During this period, the provincial Liberal party suffered because of its connections with its federal cousins.

===1986: Return to the legislature===
The Liberals&#x27; fortunes improved in the late 1980s and they returned to the Alberta legislature in the 1986 election, when leader Nicholas Taylor led them to win 4 seats and 12% of the popular vote. Following the 1987 leadership review, a leadership contest was held in 1988.

The race was contested by Taylor, MLA, Sheldon Chumir, MLA, Grant Mitchell, and Edmonton Mayor Laurence Decore. Decore was elected leader of the party on a first ballot victory.

The Alberta Liberal Party ran one candidate in the 1989 Senate Election, Bill Code, who finished with 22.5% of the vote.

===The party in the 1990s===
In the 1993 election, the Liberals, under former Edmonton mayor Laurence Decore, enjoyed their greatest success since holding power when they swept Edmonton, winning a total of 32 seats, and collecting 39% of the popular vote. This enabled the party to displace the New Democrats to become the Official Opposition to the Progressive Conservative government of Ralph Klein.

Although Decore now led the second-largest opposition caucus in the province&#x27;s history, the result was still seen as a disappointment to some prominent Liberals who felt the party had missed its best chance in over 70 years to form government. Under increasing pressure, Decore resigned the leadership in 1994. Four MLAs contested the race to succeed him: Edmonton McClung MLA Grant Mitchell, Fort McMurray MLA Adam Germain, Edmonton-Roper MLA Sine Chadi, and Calgary-Buffalo MLA Gary Dickson. After all the ballots had been counted, Mitchell was elected as party leader.

The party continued to hold its position as Official Opposition, but lost 10 seats in the 1997 election. With 18 seats in the Alberta legislature, Mitchell resigned as leader, and another race was declared.

The 1998 leadership race also saw four contestants: former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Nancy MacBeth, Lethbridge East MLA Ken Nicol, Edmonton Meadowlark MLA Karen Leibovici, and Edmonton Riverview MLA Linda Sloan. MacBeth was elected on the first ballot.

===The 2000s===

In the 2001 election, MacBeth led a campaign which ended with only seven Liberal MLAs being elected. MacBeth also lost her own seat in the election.

In the days following the 2001 election, MacBeth resigned and Ken Nicol was acclaimed leader. Nicol led the party until 2004, when he ran for the federal Liberal Party of Canada in the Lethbridge riding. Edmonton Mill Woods MLA Don Massey briefly stood as interim leader until a leadership race was held.

On March 27, 2004, Kevin Taft was elected the new leader of the Alberta Liberal Party. In the 2004 provincial election, the Liberals more than doubled their seats to 16 and increased their share of the popular vote to 29%. More significantly, and to the surprise of most observers, the Liberals were able to win three seats in the traditionally conservative city of Calgary. Additionally, in June 2007, Craig Cheffins won in a by-election, making him the fourth Alberta Liberal MLA in Calgary.

The provincial election of March 3, 2008, proved to be another setback for the party. Going up against rookie Premier Ed Stelmach, the Alberta Liberals had high hopes of increasing their seat count dramatically, particularly with the supposed discontent with the Tories in Calgary. However, the result was humbling for the Alberta Liberals. The party ended with only nine seats, down from 16 when the election was called. The party&#x27;s power based in Edmonton was hit especially hard, with eight seats won in 2004 going Conservative. On June 26, 2008, Taft announce his intention to resign as leader. Dr. David Swann was elected as the new Liberal leader on December 13, 2008, defeating two other contenders on the first ballot.

After serving as leader for three years on February 1, 2011, Swann announced his resignation as leader. The 2011 leadership election saw another doctor, Dr. Raj Sherman, win the leadership of the party, who then went on to lead the party into the 2012 general election.

===Recent history===
In the 2012 general election, the Liberals dropped from eight seats in the legislature to five. It was the third party in the legislature. Sherman announced his resignation as leader on January 26, 2015, effective immediately. Calgary-Mountain View MLA and former leader David Swann was named interim leader on February 1, 2015, chosen over Edmonton-Centre MLA Laurie Blakeman in a vote by the party&#x27;s board of directors.

Although still interim leader, Swann led the party into the 2015 provincial election in which the Alberta New Democratic Party swept to power with a majority government, defeating the Progressive Conservatives after 44 years. The Liberal Party was reduced from 5 seats to 1; Swann became the party&#x27;s sole MLA.

In the leadership election of 2017, lawyer and former Calgary-Buffalo candidate David Khan received 54.8% of the votes, defeating one rival to become the permanent Liberal leader, under controversial circumstances. Under his leadership, the Liberals were shut out of the legislature in the 2019 provincial election for the first time since 1982 and experienced their worst results since 1971. Khan resigned from the leadership on November 22, 2020.

On March 6, 2021, John Roggeveen was selected by the board of directors as the interim leader.

The August 12, 2022 deadline for nominations for the party&#x27;s leadership election passed with no candidates signing up to run for the position.

On December 8, 2022, Roggeveen was appointed the permanent leader of the party.

In the 2023 general election, the Liberals got its lowest vote record in its history with just 0.24%, which is thought to also be due somewhat to the federal Liberals very high unpopularity in the province, even though both parties have no connection with each other, sharing only its name and a similar platform. Talk has begun within the Party to potentially change its name to distance itself more from the Federal Liberals, such as in other provinces like when BC United changed its name from the BC Liberal Party (BC United is actually on the centre-right of the political spectrum), and the Saskatchewan Progress Party changing its name from the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan.

<doc id="482702" wikidata="Q4862784" url="?curid=482702" title="Baron Sandys">
<text>Baron Sandys () is a title that has been created three times, once in the Peerage of England, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation, as Baron Sandys, &quot;of The Vyne&quot;, in Hampshire, was in the Peerage of England in 1523 for William Sandys, the favourite of King Henry VIII. It passed through several generations of his descendants until it fell into abeyance circa 1683 at the death of the eighth Baron, in which state it has remained since.

The second creation, as Baron Sandys, &quot;of Ombersley in the County of Worcester&quot;, was in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1743 for Samuel Sandys, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. This title became extinct on the death of his son Edwin, the second Baron, in 1797. The family estates were inherited by Edwin&#x27;s niece Mary Hill, Marchioness of Downshire, widow of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire.

The third creation, again as Baron Sandys, &quot;of Ombersley in the County of Worcester&quot;, was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1802 for Mary Hill, Marchioness of Downshire, widow of Arthur Hill, 2nd Marquess of Downshire.

The barony was created with remainder to her younger sons Lord Arthur Moyses William Hill, Lord Marcus Hill, Lord Augustus Hill and Lord George Hill successively, and failing them to her eldest son Arthur Blundell Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire.

She was succeeded according to the special remainder by her second son Lord Arthur Moyses William, the second Baron. He was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and also represented County Down in the House of Commons. He never married and was succeeded by his next brother, the third Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Newry and Evesham. In 1861 Lord Sandys assumed by Royal licence the surname of Sandys in lieu of Hill. This line of the family failed on the death of his younger son, the fifth Baron, in 1904. The late Baron was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the grandson of Lord George Hill, the fifth son of the first Baroness.

The sixth baron&#x27;s son, the seventh Baron, succeeded in 1961. Lord Sandys notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1979 and 1983 in the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. He died on 11 February 2013
and was succeeded in the peerage, under the terms of the special remainder, by the ninth Marquess of Downshire.

The family seat is Ombersley Court in Ombersley near Droitwich in Worcestershire. The house has been up for sale since the death of the previous Lord Sandys. The traditional burial place of the family is the Sandys Mausoleum in the churchyard of St Andrew, Ombersley. When St Andrew&#x27;s Church was built in its current form between 1825 and 1829, the chancel of the old church was adapted for use as a mausoleum for the Sandys family, who were lords of the manor.

<text>Eduard Kukan (26 December 1939 – 10 February 2022) was a Slovakian politician who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1998 to 2006. He was a candidate in the presidential election held on 3 April 2004, and although pre-election polls had suggested he would come first, he actually came in third behind the eventual President Ivan Gašparovič and former prime minister Vladimír Mečiar, thus preventing him from contesting the run-off. He was elected Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in 2009, a position he held until 2019.

In 1999, Kukan was appointed United Nations Special Envoy on Kosovo by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, a role he held alongside Carl Bildt.

==Early life and education==
Kukan graduated from The Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1964, where he also gained a strong knowledge of the Swahili language. After graduation he received a Doctorate in Law from the Faculty of Law of the Charles University in Prague.

==Diplomatic career==
Since then his employments have included:

*Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia in Prague (began on 1 August 1964)
**Headquarters in the Department of Sub-Saharan Africa (1964–1968)
**Secretariat of the Minister (1973–1977)
**Director of the Department of Sub-Saharan Africa (1981–1985)
**Director of the Department of Latin America (1988–1990)
*Czechoslovak Embassy in Lusaka (1968–1973)
*Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington as Minister-Counsellor and Deputy Ambassador (1977–1981)
*Czechoslovak Embassy in Addis Ababa as Ambassador (1985–1988)
*Permanent Representative of Czechoslovakia to the United Nations in New York (1991)
*Permanent Representative of Slovakia to the UN (1993)
**UN Chairman of the Committee for Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Affairs
**Special Envoy for the Balkans (1991–2001)
*Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia (March 1994 – December 1994)
*Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia (October 1998 – 2006)
*Special Envoy for the Balkans (1991–2001)

==Member of the European Parliament, 2009–2019==
Kukan has been a Member of the European Parliament since the 2009 European elections. In the election campaign, he led the list of candidates of the centre-right Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKÚ).

Kukan has since been serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition, he was a member of the Subcommittee on Human Rights between 2009 and 2014. In 2014, he moved to the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

In 2010, Kukan joined the &quot;Friends of the EEAS&quot;, an unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on the formation of the European External Action Service.

Kukan led the parliament&#x27;s monitoring mission during the Ugandan general elections in 2016.

==Other activities==
* Global Panel Foundation, Member of the Board of Advisors 
* He was a teacher at the Comenius University in Bratislava, Faculty of Law, Department of International Law and International Relations.

==Personal life and death==
Kukan was married and had two adult children. In addition to his native tongue and Swahili, he spoke English, Russian, and Spanish. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary law degree by the Upsala College in New Jersey.

He died from a heart attack in Bratislava on 9 February 2022, at the age of 82.

<text>The Goldendoodle is a designer dog created by crossbreeding a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. First widely bred in the 1990s, they are bred in three different sizes—each corresponding to the size of Poodle used as a parent.

Goldendoodles often demonstrate Golden Retrievers&#x27; intuitive and human-oriented nature in addition to the intelligent personality and &quot;allergy-friendly&quot; coat of a Poodle.

== History ==
In the 1990s, designer dog breeders in Australia and the United States (Ryan Harvey) started to widely cross Golden Retrievers and Poodles, adopting the term goldendoodle to describe the cross. The name doodle is also used to describe this crossbreed. The name goldendoodle is derived from &quot;golden&quot; (from Golden Retriever) and &quot;Labradoodle&quot; (itself a portmanteau of Labrador Retriever and a Poodle). Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually preceded the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who crossed the two breeds in 1969. The cross can result in a healthier animal than either of the parent breeds.

The original aim of the goldendoodle&#x27;s breeders was to produce an alternative to the popular labradoodle. Initially goldendoodles were only bred from standard-sized Poodles, but designer breeders also started using small varieties of Poodles to create a smaller crossbreed. As they are a crossbreed, they are not recognized by the AKC, FCI or British Kennel Clubs. Goldendoodles have been developed beyond the F1 (Golden Retriever crossed with a Poodle) and are now available in deeper generations created by crossing two goldendoodles. These are called multigenerational or multigen goldendoodles.

== Characteristics ==

=== Appearance ===
The appearance, size, and coat of goldendoodles can vary considerably according to their breeding generations and what type of Poodle parents they have. While some goldendoodles share common traits, each goldendoodle might have its own unique appearance and temperament.

In general, goldendoodles have round skulls, broad muzzles, heavily feathered tail, drop ears, and oval-shaped eyes. Goldendoodles&#x27; retriever parentage makes their body long and muscular, and likely to have a deep chest and wide stance.

The goldendoodle can be bred from any one of the Standard, Miniature or Toy-sized Poodles, the resultant offspring coming in several sizes: the standard, medium and miniature goldendoodles. The standard goldendoodle typically stands and weighs , the medium goldendoodle typically stands and weighs , and the miniature goldendoodle typically stands up to and weighs 

The goldendoodle is a long-haired dog breed and their coat can vary considerably, there are three main coat types: straight, wavy and curly. Wavy coated goldendoodles are a combination of the Poodle&#x27;s curly coat and the Golden Retriever&#x27;s straight coat. Their coat is wavy, with loose, shaggy curls. This type of coat is the most common amongst goldendoodles. Curly coated goldendoodles resemble the coat of a Poodle. Their coat is thick and curly. Goldendoodle coats come in varying colors, with the most common colors being cream, red, black, gold, apricot, brown, or a combination (parti-colored).

Goldendoodles are often claimed to be &#x27;hypoallergenic&#x27; or &#x27;non-shedding&#x27;. However research has shown that hypoallergenicity can not be an official dog breed characteristic. AKC also asserts that &quot;there is no such thing as a completely hypoallergenic dog&quot;.

It used to be thought that the higher the percentage of Poodle is in a goldendoodle&#x27;s heritage, the less likely it is to shed. It was also thought that curlier coated goldendoodles tend to shed lighter and produce less dander.

=== Behavior ===
In general, goldendoodles tend to take on a Golden Retriever’s friendly, affectionate, trustworthy and enthusiastic nature, whilst also demonstrating a Poodle’s reputable intelligence, sociability and trainability. Goldendoodles predominantly exhibit high levels of energy, loyalty and playfulness; they are often friendly with children and considered a good family pet. This friendliness and loyalty, however, means they are prone to separation anxiety, especially as puppies. The crossbreed often exhibits strong retriever instincts inherited from its gundog parent breeds, which make them have an active mouth and high tendency to retrieve objects.

A 2019 behavioural study compared goldendoodles to their parent breeds: on average, goldendoodles displayed greater dog-rivalry, dog-directed aggression and fear, and stranger-directed fear than purebred Golden Retrievers or Poodles.

== Health ==
Goldendoodles may avoid inheriting disease or health issues from parents, but may alternatively be susceptible to more health issues if the parents are unhealthy to begin with.

Goldendoodles are prone to megaesophagus.

== Popularity and uses ==
Primarily bred as companion dogs, goldendoodles have been successfully trained as therapy dogs, guide dogs, nut-detection dogs detecting nuts in food for people with nut allergies, and other forms of assistance dogs.

In some regions of the United States it has become one of the most popular dog varieties. In Australia, it was named one of the top twenty most popular dog varieties in 2020 where, due to the increased demand for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic, prices for a puppy have risen from around $3,500 AUD before the pandemic, to as much as $15,000 AUD by September 2020.

In a 2012 charity auction, American musician Usher paid US$12,000 for a goldendoodle puppy.

Despite their growing popularity, goldendoodles remain unrecognized by prominent canine organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC) or British Kennel Clubs due to their hybrid status.

<text>A secret treaty is a treaty (international agreement) in which the contracting state parties have agreed to conceal the treaty&#x27;s existence or substance from other states and the public. Such a commitment to keep the agreement secret may be contained in the instrument itself or in a separate agreement.

According to one compilation of secret treaties published in 2004, there have been 593 secret treaties negotiated by 110 countries and independent political entities since the year 1521. Secret treaties were highly important in the balance of power diplomacy of 18th and 19th century Europe, but are rare today.

Secret treaties have been prevalent in authoritarian states where rulers use the treaties to suppress domestic opposition and unrest.

==History==

The &quot;elaborate alliance systems&quot; among European powers, &quot;each secured by a network of secret treaties, financial arrangements, and &#x27;military understandings, are commonly cited as one of the causes of World War I. For example, the Reinsurance Treaty of June 1887 between Germany and Russia, which was negotiated by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck for Germany to avoid a two-front war, was a &quot;highly secret treaty&quot; in which the two powers pledged a three-year period to remain neutral if the other became involved in a war with a third country unless Germany attacked Russia&#x27;s longstanding ally, France, or Russia attacked Germany&#x27;s longstanding ally, Austria-Hungary.

The use of &quot;secret agreements and undertakings between several allies or between one state and another&quot; continued throughout World War I. Some of them were irreconcilably inconsistent, &quot;leaving a bitter legacy of dispute&quot; at the end of the war. Some important secret treaties of the era include the one for the German–Ottoman alliance, which was concluded in Constantinople on August 2, 1914. That treaty provided that Germany and Turkey would remain neutral in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, but if Russia intervened &quot;with active military measures&quot;, both countries would become military allies. Another important secret treaty was the Treaty of London, concluded on April 26, 1915, in which Italy was promised certain territorial concessions in exchange for joining the war on the Triple Entente (Allied) side. Another secret treaty was the Treaty of Bucharest, concluded between Romania and the Triple Entente powers (Britain, France, Italy, and Russia) on August 17, 1916 in which Romania pledged to attack Austria-Hungary and not to seek a separate peace in exchange for certain territorial gains. Article 16 of that treaty provided, &quot;The present arrangement shall be held secret.&quot;

==Early efforts at reform==

After the outbreak of World War I, public opinion in many countries demanded more open diplomacy. After the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power in Russia in November 1917, Leon Trotsky published the secret treaties that the Tsarist government had made with the Entente powers, including the Treaty of London and the Constantinople Agreement. He proposed the abolition of secret diplomacy. That move caused international embarrassment and &quot;a strong, sustained reaction against secret diplomacy&quot;.

US President Woodrow Wilson was an opponent of secret diplomacy and viewed it as a threat to peace. He made the abolition of secret diplomacy the first point of his Fourteen Points, set forth in a speech to Congress, on January 8, 1918, after the country had entered the war. Wilson &quot;dissociated the United States from the Allies&#x27; earlier secret commitments and sought to abolish them forever once the war had been won&quot;. The Fourteen Points were based on a draft paper prepared by Walter Lippmann and his colleagues on the Inquiry, Isaiah Bowman, Sidney Mezes, and David Hunter Miller. Lippmann&#x27;s draft was a direct response to the secret treaties, which Lippman had been shown by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Lippman&#x27;s task was &quot;to take the secret treaties, analyze the parts which were tolerable, and separate them from those which we regarded as intolerable, and then develop a position which conceded as much to the Allies as it could, but took away the poison. ... It was all keyed upon the secret treaties. That&#x27;s what decided what went into the Fourteen Points.&quot;

Wilson repeated his Fourteen Points at the Paris Peace Conference, where he proposed a commitment to &quot;open covenants ... openly arrived at&quot; and the elimination of &quot;private international understandings of any kind [so that] diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view&quot;. The Wilsonian position was codified in Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which mandated that all League of Nations members states register every treaty or international agreement with the League secretariat and that no treaty was binding unless so registered. That led to the rise of the treaty registration system &quot;although not every treaty that would have been subject to registration was duly registered&quot;.

===League of Nations era===
In 1935, Italy was determined to annex Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), and the League attempted to moderate between the two countries with little success. In December 1935, British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare made a secret plan with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval outside of the League of Nations and concluded the Hoare–Laval Pact to give away most of Abyssinia to Italy. Two months later, news leaked out about the Hoare–Laval Pact, and Hoare resigned from the Cabinet amid public opposition to appeasement. The episode severely damaged the reputation of the League, which showed that it could not serve as an effective channel for the adjudication of international disputes.

One of the most infamous secret treaties in history was the Additional Secret Protocol to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which was negotiated by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The pact itself, a ten-year non-aggression agreement, was public, but the Additional Secret Protocol, superseded by a similar secret protocol, the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty, the next month, carved up spheres of influence in Eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and placed Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Bessarabia (part of Romania), and eastern Poland in the Soviet sphere and western Poland and Lithuania in the German sphere. The existence of the secret protocol was not confirmed until 1989. When it became public, it caused outrage in the Baltic states although they had suspected its existence.

The percentages agreement was a secret pact between Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the Fourth Moscow Conference in October 1944 on how to divide various European countries among the leaders&#x27; respective spheres of influence. The agreement was officially made public by Churchill twelve years later in the final volume of his memoir of the Second World War.
==Decline in modern times==

After World War II, the registration system that had begun with the League of Nations was continued through the United Nations. Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations, based on Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, provides that:

Similarly, Article 80 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (which entered into force in 1980) requires a party to the convention to register any treaty to which it is a party once the treaty enters into force. However, neither Article 102 of the UN Charter nor Article 80 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties has preserved the latter part of Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Consequently, failure to register a treaty &quot;as soon as possible&quot; is a violation of the Charter and Convention, but does not render the treaty invalid or ineffective.

Over the years, the UN has developed an extensive treaty-registration system, detailed in its Repertory of Practice and Treaty Handbook. From December 1946 through July 2013, the United Nations Secretariat recorded over 200,000 treaties published in the United Nations Treaty Series pursuant to Article 102 of the UN Charter. Still, today &quot;a substantial number of treaties are not registered, mainly due to practical reasons, such as the administrative or ephemeral charter of some treaties&quot;. Non-registered treaties are not necessarily secret, since such treaties are often published elsewhere.

Some true secret treaties still exist, however, mostly in the context of agreements to establish foreign military bases. For example, after the 1960 Security Treaty between the U.S. and Japan, the two nations entered into three agreements that (according to an expert panel convened by the Japanese Foreign Ministry) could be defined as secret treaties, at least in a broad sense. These agreements involved the transit and storage of nuclear weapons by U.S. forces in Japan despite Japan&#x27;s formal non-nuclear weapons policy. Prior to their public release in 2010, the Japanese government had gone so far as convicting journalist Nishiyama Takichi, who tried to expose one treaty, for espionage. Operation Condor was a secret treaty between the US and five South American nations to coordinate counter-insurgency and &quot;dirty war&quot; against communist rebels and other leftists in Latin America.

According to Dörr &amp; Schmalenbach&#x27;s commentary on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, &quot;the fact that today secret treaties do not play an essential role is less a result of [Article 102 of the UN Charter] than of an overall change in the conduct of international relations&quot;.

According to Charles Lipson:

With private international understandings &quot;virtually eliminated&quot; among democratic states, informal agreements &quot;live on as their closest modern substitutes&quot;.

==Secrecy of international negotiations==
Secret treaties (in which the agreement itself is secret) are distinct from secret negotiations (in which the ongoing negotiations are confidential, but the final agreement is public). Colin Warbrick writes that in Britain, &quot;the prerogative power to negotiate and conclude treaties puts the government in a powerful position. It does not need to seek a negotiating mandate from Parliament and can keep its positions confidential until the conclusion of negotiations.&quot; The traditional rule in favor of secrecy of negotiations is in tension with values of transparency: Anne Peters writes that &quot;the growing significance of multilateral treaties as global ... instruments invites a readjustment of the relative weight accorded to the values of discreteness and confidentiality of diplomatic treaty negotiations ... on one hand, and the interests of third parties and the global public on the other hand.&quot; The secrecy of negotiations for free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement have been politically controversial, with some commentators favoring greater transparency and others emphasizing the need for confidentiality.

<text>Baron Ellenborough, of Ellenborough in the County of Cumberland, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 19 April 1802 for the lawyer, judge and politician Sir Edward Law, Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1802 to 1818. His son, the second Baron, notably served as Governor-General of India. On 22 October 1844 the second Baron was created Viscount Southam, of Southam in the County of Gloucester, and Earl of Ellenborough, in the County of Cumberland. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His only son predeceased him and on his death in 1871 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.

However, he was succeeded in the barony by his nephew, the third Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Law, Member of Parliament for Cambridge University, second son of the first Baron. In 1885 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Towry (which was that of his father&#x27;s mother). On the death of his son, the fourth Baron, this line of the family failed. He was succeeded by his cousin, the fifth Baron. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the sixth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the ninth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2013.

<text>Marjane Satrapi (; ; born 22 November 1969) is a French-Iranian graphic novelist, cartoonist, illustrator, film director, and children&#x27;s book author. Her best-known works include the graphic novel &quot;Persepolis&quot; and its film adaptation, the graphic novel &quot;Chicken with Plums&quot;, &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom&quot; and the Marie Curie biopic &quot;Radioactive&quot;.

==Biography==
Satrapi was born in Iran. She grew up in Tehran in an upper-middle class Iranian family and attended the French-language school Lycée Razi. Both her parents were politically active and supported leftist causes against the monarchy of the last Shah. Her maternal great-grandfather, Nasser-al-Din Shah, was the Persian emperor from 1848 to 1896. When the Iranian Revolution took place in 1979, her parents had to undergo the rule of the Islamic fundamentalists who had taken power.

During her youth, Satrapi was exposed to the growing brutalities of the various regimes. Many of her family and friends were persecuted, arrested, and murdered. She found a hero in her paternal uncle, Anoosh, who had been a political prisoner and lived in exile in the Soviet Union for a time. Satrapi greatly admired her uncle, and he in turn doted on her, treating her more as a daughter than a niece. Once back in Iran, Anoosh was arrested again and sentenced to death. Anoosh was only allowed one visitor the night before his execution, and he requested Satrapi. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in the prison. It is said that Anoosh was the nephew of Fereydun Ebrahimi, Minister of Justice of Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government, a secessionist government that tried to secede from Pahlavi Persia in 1945.

Although Satrapi&#x27;s parents encouraged her to be strong-willed and defend her rights, they grew concerned for her safety. In her teens by this time, she was skirting trouble with police for disregarding modesty codes and buying music banned by the regime.

They arranged for her to live with a family friend, Zozo, to study abroad, and in 1983, at age fourteen, she arrived in Vienna, Austria, to attend the Lycée Français de Vienne. She stayed in Vienna through her high school years, often moving from one residence to another as situations changed, and sometimes stayed at friends&#x27; homes. Eventually, she was homeless and lived on the streets for three months, until she was hospitalized for an almost deadly bout of bronchitis. Upon recovery, she returned to Iran. She studied visual communication, eventually obtaining a master&#x27;s degree from Islamic Azad University in Tehran.

Satrapi then married Reza, a veteran of the Iran–Iraq War, when she was 21, whom she later divorced. She then moved to Strasbourg, France, to study at the Haute école des arts du Rhin (HEAR). Her parents told her that Iran was no longer the place for her, and encouraged her to stay in Europe permanently.

Satrapi is currently married to Mattias Ripa, a Swedish national. They live in Paris. Apart from her native language, Persian, she speaks French, English, Swedish, German, and Italian.

==Career==

===Graphic novel===
Satrapi became famous worldwide because of her critically acclaimed autobiographical graphic novels, originally published in French in four parts in 2000–2003 and in English translation in two parts in 2003 and 2004, respectively, as &quot;Persepolis and Persepolis 2&quot;, which describe her childhood in Iran and her adolescence in Europe. &quot;Persepolis&quot; won the &quot;Angoulême &quot;Coup de Coeur&quot; Award&quot; at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. In 2013, Chicago schools were ordered by the district to remove &quot;Persepolis&quot; from classrooms because of the work&#x27;s graphic language and violence. This banning incited protests and controversy. Her later publication, &quot;Embroideries&quot; (&quot;Broderies&quot;), was also nominated for the Angoulême Album of the Year award in 2003, an award that her graphic novel &quot;Chicken with Plums&quot; (&quot;Poulet aux prunes&quot;) won. She has also contributed to the Op-Ed section of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

ComicsAlliance listed Satrapi as one of 12 women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.

Satrapi prefers the term &quot;comic books&quot; to &quot;graphic novels.&quot; &quot;People are so afraid to say the word &#x27;comic&#x27;,&quot; she told the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2011. &quot;It makes you think of a grown man with pimples, a ponytail and a big belly. Change it to &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; and that disappears. No: it&#x27;s all comics.&quot;

===Films===
&quot;Persepolis&quot; was adapted into an animated film of the same name. It debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival in May 2007 and shared a Special Jury Prize with Carlos Reygadas&#x27;s &quot;Silent Light&quot; (&quot;Luz silenciosa&quot;). Co-written and co-directed by Satrapi and director Vincent Paronnaud, the French-language picture stars the voices of Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, and Simon Abkarian. The English version, starring the voices of Gena Rowlands, Sean Penn, and Iggy Pop, was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 80th Academy Awards in January 2008. Satrapi was the first woman to be nominated for the award. However, the Iranian government denounced the film and got it dropped from the Bangkok International Film Festival. Otherwise, &quot;Persepolis&quot; was a very successful film both commercially (with over a million admissions in France alone) as well as critically, winning Best First Film at the César Awards 2008. The film reflects many tendencies of first-time filmmaking in France (which makes up around 40% of all French cinema each year), notably in its focus on very intimate rites of passage, and quite ambivalently recounted coming-of-age moments.

Satrapi and Paronnaud continued their successful collaboration with a second film, a live-action adaptation of &quot;Chicken with Plums&quot;, released in late 2011. In 2012, Satrapi directed and acted in the comedy crime film &quot;La bande des Jotas&quot; (&quot;Gang of the Jotas&quot;), from her own screenplay.

In 2014 Satrapi directed the comedy-horror film &quot;The Voices&quot;, from a screenplay by Michael R. Perry.

In 2019, Satrapi directed a biopic of two-time Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie, titled &quot;Radioactive&quot;.

In 2021, Satrapi starred in the French animated short film &quot;The Soloists&quot;, voicing Ava, one of the three eponymous sisters fighting to express their musical talents in a country with blatantly sexist laws.

===Political activism===
Following the Iranian elections in June 2009, Satrapi and Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf appeared before Green Party members in the European Parliament to present a document allegedly received from a member of the Iranian electoral commission claiming that the reform candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, had actually won the election, and that the conservative incumbent Mahmoud Ahmedinejad had received only 12% of the vote.

In 2022 she voiced her support for the Mahsa Amini protests.

<text>Edward Osbaldeston was an English martyr, born about 1560. Не was hanged, drawn and quartered at York, 16 November 1594.

==Life==
Edward Osbaldeston was born about 1560 at Osbaldeston Hall near Blackburn, Lancashire. He was the son of Thomas Osbaldeston, and nephew of Edward Osbaldeston, of Osbaldeston Hall. He went to the English College of Douai, then at Reims, where he was ordained deacon in December 1583, and priest 21 September 1585. He had said his first Mass on the feast day of St. Jerome, and in consequence had a great devotion to that saint.

He was sent on the English mission 27 April 1589, and was apprehended at night through the instrumentality of an Anglican priest named Thomas Clark at an inn at Tollerton, Yorkshire, upon St. Jerome&#x27;s day, 30 September 1594.

The day following his arrest he was taken to York where he was tried at the next assizes and attained of high treason for being a priest.

Bishop Richard Challoner prints the greater part of a letter addressed by the martyr to his fellow-prisoners in York Castle, the full text of which is still extant, and which reveals the great humility and serene trust in God with which he anticipated his death.

Edward Osbaldeston was among the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.

<doc id="482784" wikidata="Q2449246" url="?curid=482784" title="Teller Amendment">
<text>The Teller Amendment was an amendment to a joint resolution of the United States Congress, enacted on April 20, 1898, in reply to President William McKinley&#x27;s War Message.The amendment was introduced after the USS &quot;Maine&quot; exploded in February 1898, an event that heightened tensions occurring between the United States and Spain. This eventually led Congress to declare war on Spain in April and demand the Spanish relinquish control of Cuba. To make clear that the United States had no colonial ambitions, Congress approved an amendment proposed by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, affirming Cuba&#x27;s right to independence. The amendment aided in placing a restriction on the United States military&#x27;s presence in Cuba. Accordingly, the United States in the amendment commanded that the government of Spain expel its land and naval forces from Cuba and its waters. According to the clause, the U.S. could not annex Cuba but only leave &quot;control of the island to its people.&quot; In simple terms, the United States would recognize the Cuban people as &quot;free and independent.&quot; However, the United States would not depart from the country until it had helped to pacify it. In order to pacify it, they would be permitted to employ land and naval forces as necessary to complete the objective at hand. Once pacified, the United States would have relinquished authority of Cuba&#x27;s government to its people. 

==McKinley&#x27;s war message==
In the political atmosphere in the U.S. growing out of the Cuban struggle for independence, and following on the February 15, 1898 the sinking of the USS &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana harbor President William McKinley, on 11 April 1898, asked the Congress,

... to authorize and empower the President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between the government of Spain and the people of Cuba, and to ensure in the island the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations, ensuring peace and tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and to use the military and naval forces of the United States as may be necessary for these purposes.

==Congressional response==
Congress debated a joint resolution in response to the president&#x27;s request for a week. In near-final form, its three parts constituted:

==The Teller Amendment==
Senator Henry M. Teller, a Republican from Colorado proposed the amendment to ensure that the United States would not establish permanent control over Cuba following the cessation of hostilities with Spain. The Republican McKinley administration would not recognize belligerency or independence as it was unsure of the form an insurgency government might take. Without recognizing some government in Cuba, Congressmen feared McKinley was simply priming the island for annexation. The Teller clause quelled any anxiety of annexation by stating that the United States

... hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its people.

The proposed amendment gained support from several forces:

... those who opposed annexing territory containing large numbers of blacks and Catholics, those who sincerely supported Cuban independence, and representatives of the domestic sugar business, including sponsor Senator Henry Teller of Colorado, who feared Cuban competition.

(A significant import tariff on foreign sugar would be removed should Cuba be annexed.)

The Senate passed the amendment by voice vote, then passed the amended version of the resolution 42 to 35, on April 19, 1898, and the House concurred the same day, 311 to 6. President McKinley signed the joint resolution on April 20, 1898, and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain.

This joint resolution would declare: 

The Spanish–American War lasted from April 25 to August 12, 1898, and it ended with the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. As a result, Spain lost control over the remains of its overseas empire consisting of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippine islands, Guam and other islands.

After Spanish troops left the island in December 1898, the United States occupied Cuba until 1902, and as promised in the Teller Amendment did not attempt to annex the island. However, under the Platt Amendment, crafted in 1901 by U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root to replace the Teller Amendment, important decisions of the government of Cuba remained subject to override by the United States. This suzerainty bred resentment toward the U.S.

Some historians have questioned Teller&#x27;s intentions, claiming that the real motive behind the resolution was to protect American beet sugar growers from Cuban competition. On the other hand, Teller became a leading opponent of land annexation in Cuba to grow sugar in the early 1900s, as well as President Roosevelt&#x27;s plans to grant tariff preferences to Cuba in 1903.

<doc id="482788" wikidata="Q2270653" url="?curid=482788" title="Sonic the Fighters">
<text>also known as Sonic Championship, is a 1996 three-dimensional fighting video game from Sega. The game, developed by Sega AM2 and built on their Model 2 arcade system, pits players in one-on-one battles with a roster of characters from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was made using the fighting engine for &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; (1995), and it was the first 3D game in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series; the idea for a &quot;Sonic&quot; fighting game was conceived when a Sega AM2 programmer experimented with a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog model in &quot;Fighting Vipers,&quot; its animation impressing and convincing the Sonic Team to approve the project.

A home console port for the Sega Saturn was announced, but ultimately canceled, resulting in the game staying an arcade exclusive until 2005 with the compilation &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; for GameCube and PlayStation 2. It was rereleased again in 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring new playable characters and an online versus mode. It has since been included as a bonus game in the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; series.

&quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; received mixed reviews. Critics praised the graphics, especially the cartoon-like animations, but criticized the gameplay as rudimentary. It was ultimately regarded as disappointing for fans of the fighting game genre but an obscure novelty for &quot;Sonic&quot; fans.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; is a 3D fighting game in which players compete in one-on-one battles with characters from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise. In the game&#x27;s scenario, Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends each own one of the Chaos Emeralds. They are holding a fighting tournament to determine who will take the emeralds in order to power a spaceship and stop series antagonists Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic from building an evil fortress in space. The original arcade and 2005 release included eight playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Espio the Chameleon, Fang the Sniper, and new characters Bean the Dynamite and Bark the Polar Bear. The 2012 re-release added Metal Sonic, Doctor Robotnik, and Honey the Cat as playable characters, all previously only accessible through hacking into the original arcade version. Honey is based on a character with the same name from &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; (1996).

The game employs simple fighting game mechanics. Each character can punch, kick, and use a defensive barrier. Combining these buttons also allows for a variety of special moves unique to each character. The barrier can block attacks, but it can be damaged and eventually be destroyed by an opponent; players have access to limited number of barriers per match. The barrier does not protect from being grabbed or thrown, or from attacks from behind. Players can spend a barrier to temporarily enter &quot;Hyper Mode&quot; which allows them to perform several attacks in quick succession. Some attacks can be avoided by squatting or dodging. Players can also perform a &quot;safe landing&quot; which allows them to recover quickly when thrown or launched into the air.

==Development and release==

&quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was developed by Sega AM2, Sega&#x27;s arcade game development team behind the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series. The idea for a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; fighting game was conceived by AM2 lead developer Yu Suzuki who saw one of his programmers dabbling with a Sonic the Hedgehog model in AM2&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot;. Suzuki pitched the idea for a &quot;Sonic&quot; fighting game to Hiroshi Kataoka, another one of the heads of AM2. Since Sonic Team was in charge of licensing the &quot;Sonic&quot; characters, Kataoka had to present the idea to the head of Sonic Team, Yuji Naka. Kataoka was worried Naka would not like the concept of &quot;Sonic&quot; characters fighting each other, but Naka was receptive. At first Naka was concerned that Sonic would be unable to fight considering his large head and short arms, but he was delighted after seeing the smooth animation accomplished by Suzuki&#x27;s team. Original Sonic character designer Naoto Ohshima was also pleased with Sonic&#x27;s animations. Sega AM2 began development with Sonic Team supervising over the implementation of the characters and setting. They developed for the Sega Model 2 arcade board using the &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; engine as a foundation to build from.

Since this was the first time Sonic was being rendered with 3D graphics, Naka gave Kataoka a Sonic figurine to help his team model the character. Suzuki focused his team on modeling the characters&#x27; faces correctly so they were instantly recognizable on arcade floors. The development team added in the barrier mechanism because the characters&#x27; arms were too small for traditional blocking to look distinct. They also added rings that drop when a player is hit to make it easier for beginners to judge how much damage they were taking instead of referring to the health bar. AM2 explored whether dropped rings could be picked up to restore health or the barrier&#x27;s power, but ultimately did not include this feature. They made the controls simple to help beginners to the genre.

In early prototypes demonstrated for the press, only Sonic and Tails were shown fighting on an early stage based on Green Hill Zone. Other characters were added later, and Naka personally asked AM2 to create new characters for the Sonic universe. Suzuki jokingly said that anyone who attempted a &quot;Sonic&quot; game had the duty to create new characters. They conceived two new characters, Bean the Dynamite and Bark the Polar Bear. Bean&#x27;s design was inspired by the lead character in the Sega arcade game &quot;Dynamite Düx&quot; (1989). In later years, hackers found Honey from &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; was hidden in &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; as a playable character, and modeled as an anthropomorphic cat. Kataoka believes Honey&#x27;s character designer slipped her in there purposely.

&quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was first released in Japanese arcades in June 1996 followed by a limited release in North America in July. With its simplified controls, the game was marketed towards beginners, including women and children. In August 2005, it received its first home console release through &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot;, a &quot;Sonic&quot; games compilation for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. The collection also included &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, &quot;Sonic R&quot;, and several &quot;Sonic&quot; Game Gear titles. In November 2012, &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via each consoles&#x27; respective online marketplace. This version added Metal Sonic, Doctor Robotnik, and Honey the Cat as playable characters and featured new online versus modes. &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; is playable at the in-game arcades in &quot;Lost Judgment&quot; (2021), added as part of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series&#x27; 30th anniversary, and &quot;Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man who Erased His Name&quot; (2023). This version of the game retains the hidden characters from the digital re-releases.

Kataoka stated in 2006 that &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was the game he was most proud of. Naka also approved of the final product.

===Abandoned Sega Saturn port===
In early stages of development, Sega was planning to port &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; to the Sega Saturn. Initial release windows were theorized for late 1996, a few months after the planned arcade release. At the E3 1996 video game convention, a SquareSoft representative was given a private demonstration of new Sega Saturn development software, and reported to the press later that a Saturn version of &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was shown. In 1997, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reported a rumor that &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; would release for the Saturn in Japan mid-year and North America a couple months later. In 1998, the Saturn port was still scheduled for release in Japan, though the North American release had since been dropped. Ultimately, a Saturn port was never released. Yojiro Ogawa of Sonic Team said in retrospect that &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; was not ported to the Saturn because it was difficult to reproduce a similar experience to the arcade version. He felt they were able to accomplish this when it was re-released in 2005&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==
In July 1996, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; as being the thirteenth most popular arcade game in Japan at the time. After seeing it demoed at a Japanese arcade expo, &quot;GamePro&quot; shared their admiration of the game&#x27;s cartoon-like animation, comparing it to &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave an average review, praising the visuals but criticizing the gameplay. They believed the backgrounds and character animations were detailed well, but felt that hardcore fighting game fans would be disappointed with the lack of gameplay depth. They concluded by giving the game 3 out of 5 stars, calling it a fun game that &quot;exploits &quot;Sonic&quot; milieu without feeling too aggressive.&quot;

Critics shared mixed thoughts for its 2005 re-release on &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot;. Both &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; called it a stripped-down version of the original &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; believed it was a simplified version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. The gameplay was criticized, with most reviewers describing it as rudimentary, simple, and dated. The lack of extensive combos and depth to the game&#x27;s strategy contributed to this. Some critics recommended the game to fans of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series for the novelty of seeing a sizable roster of &quot;Sonic&quot; characters fighting with cartoon-like moves, and because this release was the only way to play the game at home at the time.
The 2012 release received unfavorable reviews. &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; called it an interesting and obscure release, and a fascinating part of Sega&#x27;s history, but concluded that it loses traction because of its lack of seriousness as a fighting game. They did, however, praise the cartoon quality of the graphics. They thought the way the characters squashed and stretched was rarely seen and still uncommon even in 2012. &quot;GamesMaster&quot; felt the game lacked depth to its gameplay compared to other fighting games. &quot;X360&quot; criticized its repetitive, simplistic gameplay and lamented how the game &quot;repeatedly discourages the use of skill.&quot;

<doc id="482794" wikidata="Q1960889" url="?curid=482794" title="Isabelle (comics)">
<text>Isabelle was a Belgian comic series drawn by Will and written by André Franquin, Delporte and Raymond Macherot.

The comic first appeared in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in 1969. Created by a top team of already-famous contributors to the magazine, the series gained a small but fanatical following. The first stories were written by Franquin (of Gaston Lagaffe fame), Delporte (editor of &quot;Spirou&quot; and writer of many comics) and Macherot (creator of &quot;Sibylline&quot;). Later, Delporte alone wrote the stories in collaboration with Will. Twelve albums were published until the series ended with Will&#x27;s death in 2000.

==Plot==
The little girl Isabelle (named after Franquin&#x27;s daughter) gets into a lot of adventures when the evil witch Kalendula troubles Isabelle&#x27;s uncle Hermès and his fiancée, the good witch Calendula (who is the descendant of the evil Kalendula). Other stories are about a magical painting, a flying village or a floating island.

The stories have a poetical tone, although mixed with tons of jokes and puns, rhyming ghosts, a talking diamond and Isabelle&#x27;s down-to-earth aunt – whose greatest concern when Isabelle gets into an adventure is whether she&#x27;s dressed warmly enough, even when she descends into Hades. The drawings are packed with details and the poetic nature of the stories comes through in the imaginative animals and backgrounds.

== Main characters ==

* Isabel, an apparently normal girl who in reality experiences extraordinary adventures
* Hermes, magician and Isabelle&#x27;s uncle
* Calendula, a witch Hermes is in love with
* Kalendula, cruel witch and grandmother of the previous one
* Chuintufle, a critter of darkness, with the appearance of a hairy worm
* Ursula, Isabel&#x27;s aunt who bakes cakes and pies, but is not aware of Isabel&#x27;s adventures

<text>The Party of the Democratic Left (, SDĽ) was a social-democratic political party in Slovakia from 1990 to 2004. It was founded in 1990 out of the Communist Party of Slovakia.

== History ==
At the party congress on 14 December 1991 in Trenčín, the congress adopted new party constitution and decided to leave federation of Communist Party of Czecho-Slovakia, due to disputes with the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and changing situation in the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. Congress reconfirmed Peter Weiss as party chairman.

From 1994 to 1997, SDĽ was a member of a coalition called &quot;Common Choice&quot; () that gained 10.18% (18 seats) in the Slovak parliament. They did not form a part of the government. Since the 2002 elections, it has had no seat in the Slovak legislature. It was a member of the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International.

On 4 December 2004, the party membership voted to merge with Direction – Social Democracy from 1 January 2005. The latter party had broken off from the SDL five years earlier.

<text>Aluísio Tancredo Gonçalves de Azevedo (; 14 April 1857 – 21 January 1913) was a Brazilian novelist, caricaturist, diplomat, playwright and short story writer. Initially a Romantic writer, he would later adhere to the Naturalist movement. He introduced the Naturalist movement in Brazil with the novel &quot;O Mulato&quot;, in 1881. He founded and occupied the 4th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1897 until his death in 1913.

==Biography==
Azevedo was born in São Luís, to David Gonçalves de Azevedo (the Portuguese vice-consul in Brazil) and Emília Amália Pinto de Magalhães. He was the younger brother of the famous playwright Artur Azevedo.

As a child, Aluísio would work as a traveling salesman. Following this, due to his love of painting and drawing, he would move to Rio de Janeiro in 1876 (where his brother Artur was living already), to study at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. After graduating, he drew caricatures for journals such as &quot;O Fígaro&quot;, &quot;O Mequetrefe&quot;, &quot;Zig-Zag&quot; and &quot;A Semana Illustrada&quot;.

His father&#x27;s death, in 1878, made him return to São Luís, in order to take care of his family. He then initiated his writer career, publishing in 1880 a typical Romantic novel, &quot;Uma Lágrima de Mulher&quot;. He helped on the creation of an anticlerical journal named &quot;O Pensador&quot;, where he wrote Abolitionist articles. In 1881 he publishes the first Brazilian Naturalist novel ever: &quot;O Mulato&quot;, that deals with the themes of racism. Consolidating his career as a writer, he could return to Rio.

He would write endlessly during the period of 1882–1895. Also dating from this period are his famous novels &quot;Casa de Pensão&quot; (1884) and &quot;O Cortiço&quot; (1890), as well as many other works written in partnership with his brother or with Émile Rouède.

In 1895 he became a diplomat. He served as a minister in Spain, Japan, England, Italy and Argentina, where he died.

<doc id="482812" wikidata="Q744325" url="?curid=482812" title="Grzegorz Rosiński">
<text>Grzegorz Rosiński ( ; born 3 August 1941) is a Polish comic book artist, illustrator and painter. He is best known for providing the artwork for the series &quot;Thorgal&quot;. His other notable work includes art drawn in the &quot;Hans&quot; and &quot;Chninkel&quot; series of comic books.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Grzegorz Rosiński was born in Stalowa Wola in 1941. In 1967 he graduated the Liceum of Fine Arts in Warsaw and then joined the Academy of Fine Arts of Warsaw.

===Major works===
Until the late 1970s he authored numerous book illustrations for various Polish publishers and authors. He also authors some of the most popular Polish comic book series of the time, including the &quot;Illustrated History of Poland&quot;, &quot;Kapitan Żbik&quot; and &quot;Pilot śmigłowca&quot;. Initially publishing his comic books only in newspapers and magazines (among them &quot;Sztandar Młodych&quot;), with time his works started to be published separately. He is also the creator and the first editor of the &quot;Relax&quot; magazine, the first Polish language magazine devoted solely to comic books.
In 1976 Rosiński received a scholarship in Belgium, where he met Jean Van Hamme, who wrote for him the series &quot;Thorgal&quot;, one of the most popular European comic book series. Since 1980, 31 volumes have been published. The comic has appeared in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. Rosiński also has made some comics for the &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, under the pseudonym &#x27;Rosek&#x27;. Although he returned to Poland, he continued in the next decades to collaborate with Belgian and French authors. In 1980 he started another successful series of comic books named &quot;Hans&quot;, this time with André-Paul Duchâteau. In 1992 Rosiński was replaced by Zbigniew Kasprzak (&quot;Kas&quot;) as the artist of the series.

After the imposition of the Martial Law in Poland in 1981, Rosiński moved to Belgium. At first, he lived with Jean Van Hamme while his wife and three kids stay behind in Warsaw. A few years later he received Belgian citizenship. He became one of the most popular authors of comic books in Western Europe. Among his later works are a series &quot;Chninkel&quot; (with Van Hamme) started in 1987 and a 1992 series titled &quot;La complainte des landes perdues&quot; (with Jean Dufaux). In 2001 the Rosiński-Van Hamme duo published yet another comic book titled &quot;Western&quot;, based on a western plot, in which Rosiński changed his style considerably. Since 2004 he published a series on &quot;Count Skarbek&quot; (with Yves Sente).

During the summer of 2011, a major exhibition was shown in the medieval town of Saint-Ursanne, Switzerland.

===Honours===
In 2006, he was awarded the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for his &quot;outstanding artistic achievements and the promotion of Polish culture&quot;. In 2007, during the International Festival of Comics and Games in Łódź, he was awarded the Silver Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis. In 2010, he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Leopold II from King Albert II of Belgium.

<text>The Afghanistan Meteorological Authority(Pashto: د افغانستان د هوا پېژندنې اداره), also referred to as the Afghanistan Meteorological Department, is located in Kabul, Afghanistan. The agency operates under the Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority and is led by Abdul Qadeer.

== History ==
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the Afghanistan Meteorological Authority had one of the most advanced weather stations available at the time and a staff of 600.

=== First Taliban Regime ===
In 1996, Taliban forces sacked its office because weather forecasting had been banned as it was considered to be sorcery. Equipment was ruined and over 100 years worth of weather records were destroyed. During that time, only real-time observers remained on staff. Because of the ban, farmers were harmed because drought information and forecasting could not take place. In 1998, an Ariana Afghan Airlines flight flew into unexpected weather, causing it to crash into a mountain, killing 45 people.

=== Recovery ===
In 2003, France financed the installation of over a dozen simple weather stations around Afghanistan. The stations provide basic information such as temperature, barometric pressure, and rainfall. Also in 2003, the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva provided the Authority with copies of its lost records.

Canadian troops at Camp Julien assisted in collecting data by launching weather balloons twice a day. The data was primarily for NATO and the armies of the U.S. and Germany, but was shared with the AMA as well. In 2016, weather balloon launches at Kabul International Airport were done by contract and NATO meteorologists on the NATO side of the complex. NATO had a Combined Meteorological Unit staffed by a Romanian Officer in Charge, Czech Republic military, and U.S. and Turkish contractors. With the aim of providing full services while the Afghans were trained to take over operations.

<text>The Raveonettes are a Danish indie rock duo, consisting of Sune Rose Wagner on guitar, instruments and vocals, and Sharin Foo on bass, guitar and vocals. Their music is characterized by close two-part vocal harmonies inspired by The Everly Brothers coupled with hard-edged electric guitar overlaid with liberal doses of noise. Their songs juxtapose the structural and chordal simplicity of 1950s and 1960s rock with intense electric instrumentation, driving beats, and often dark lyrical content (e.g., crime, drugs, murder, suicide, love, lust, and betrayal), similar to another of the band&#x27;s influences, The Velvet Underground.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
The duo met in Copenhagen and, after forming the band, began recording &quot;Whip It On&quot; at Once Was &amp; Sauna Recording Studio, a former Sony Studios facility. They booked the studio for three weeks during non-session down time late in 2001 and handled all production chores themselves. Adding guitarist Manoj Ramdas and jazz drummer Jakob Hoyer, The Raveonettes booked one of their first gigs at the SPOT festival in Aarhus, the second largest city in Denmark. After the release of &quot;Whip It On&quot; on the seminal Danish Crunchy Frog label, Hoyer and Ramdas would contribute to the next three Raveonettes albums, along with other additional musicians. However, by the time &quot;Lust Lust Lust&quot; was released in 2007, Sune and Sharin would be the only two musicians credited, showing a return to the dynamic around the time of the mini-album.

Officially,the band was discovered by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor David Fricke at the SPOT festival, and his rave review of the duo immediately resulted in a number of offers from major labels. Unofficially, the band discovered that David Fricke would be present at the SPOT festival, and they rushed a band together and headed for the festival. The band is managed by Richard Gottehrer, who has been with them from the start.

&quot;Whip It On&quot; was named &quot;Best Rock Album of the Year&quot; at the Danish Music Awards (Denmark&#x27;s Grammy equivalent) on 1 March 2003, while The Raveonettes were picked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Q Magazine&quot; as being among the harbingers of the &quot;Next Wave&quot; of contemporary music.

In 2006, &quot;Blender&quot; named Sharin Foo one of rock&#x27;s hottest women, alongside Courtney Love, Joan Jett and Liz Phair.

=== &quot;Chain Gang of Love&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Chain Gang of Love&quot;, was produced by Richard Gottehrer and The Raveonettes&#x27; own Sune Rose Wagner. The album was recorded in Denmark and New York from 9–17 October, 6–12 November, and 4–10 December 2002, and mixed in London in early 2003. The thirteen songs on &quot;Chain Gang of Love&quot; are written by Sune Rose Wagner with the exception of &quot;That Great Love Sound&quot;, which Sune co-wrote with Gottehrer. Portions of this song were featured in a U.S. ad for Kmart. The album is notable in that all the songs were written in the key B-flat major.

=== &quot;Pretty in Black&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Pretty in Black&quot;, broadened their musical palette, featuring guest vocals from Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes as well as guest instrumental spots from Maureen Tucker (of The Velvet Underground) and Martin Rev (of Suicide). This was their first album in which Sharin Foo did not play bass; instead, The Raveonettes added bass player Anders Christensen, who had toured with seminal jazz drummer Paul Motian, amongst others. Christensen recorded on the album and toured with the band. At the end of the 2005 tour, guitar player Manoj Ramdas left the band to concentrate on his new band SPEKTR.

The video for the single &quot;Love in a Trashcan&quot;, directed by Peder Pedersen, features pink bars and blocks with words like &quot;Vamp&quot; and &quot;Teaser&quot; scrolling by the band members, and is reminiscent of an early-1960s cosmetic ad.

=== &quot;Lust Lust Lust&quot; ===
The duo&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Lust Lust Lust&quot;, was released in November 2007 in Europe and February 2008 in the U.S. The album received generally positive reviews, with the &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s Hardeep Phull describing it as &quot;their most engrossing album.&quot;

In December 2008, Sune Rose Wagner released a solo album, simply titled &quot;Sune Rose Wagner&quot;. All of the songs are sung in his native language of Danish.

=== &quot;In and Out of Control&quot; ===
The Raveonettes&#x27; fourth album, &quot;In and Out of Control&quot;, was released 6 October 2009, with &quot;Last Dance&quot; released as the lead-off single. The album was co-written and produced by Thomas Troelsen. Both &quot;Last Dance&quot; and &quot;Suicide&quot;, another song from the album, have been featured on The CW&#x27;s &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;.

===&quot;Raven in the Grave&quot;===
&quot;Raven in the Grave&quot;, The Raveonettes&#x27; fifth album, was released 4 April 2011. The album has produced three singles to date.

===&quot;Observator&quot;===
The duo released a new album, titled &quot;Observator&quot;, on 11 September 2012. The lead single &#x27;Observations&#x27; was released 25 June. The second single &#x27;She Owns the Streets&#x27; was released 9 July.

===&quot;Pe&#x27;ahi&quot;===
The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Pe&#x27;ahi&quot;, was released 22 July 2014. Due to the purposeful lack of promotion or formal announcement of a release date the album was dubbed a &quot;surprise&quot; release.

===&quot;2016 Atomized&quot; (Anti-Album), hiatus, return and &quot;The Raveonettes Sing…&quot;===
In 2015 the band announced the Rave-Sound-of-the-Month saying that in every month of 2016 the band were recording and releasing a new song. Dubbed by the band as the &quot;Anti-Album&quot;, the twelve songs were released individually for download online in each month of the year and were released 21 April 2017 as a full album titled &quot;2016 Atomized&quot;.

In March 2018 the band released a song called &quot;Ghost&quot;, recorded during the 2016 Atomized project. The duo then went on an indefinite hiatus to allow Sune to release a solo album in 2018; though this never materialised. In November 2020, the band released the song &quot;Snowstorm&quot;, their first release in over two years.

The band returned to touring in 2022, performing their EP Whip It On in full at various festivals throughout the summer as well as a tour at the end of the year. New music is also in the works, with a new album completed in late 2023. The band will release their ninth studio album, &quot;The Raveonettes Sing…&quot;, on 19 July 2024. The album, according to the press release, is a &quot;collection of some of the songs that inspired us to start the band&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by its first single, a cover of the Gram Parsons song, &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel&quot;, on 17 May 2024. The album&#x27;s second single, a cover of The Everly Brothers song &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, was released on 29 May 2024.

=== &quot;Pe&#x27;ahi 2&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Pe&#x27;ahi 2&quot;, is set to be released on 25 April 2025. It continues the thematic thread of their 2014 album Pe&#x27;ahi, which explores themes of life&#x27;s fragility, death, longing, and vulnerability. The album was recorded in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen.The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Blackest&quot;, was released on 28 February 2025.

== Instruments ==
During live performances, the band usually utilizes Fender instruments (Sune uses a number of Jazzmasters while Sharin opts for either Mustang or jazz bass, and a Jazzmaster). Sune plays a number of different guitars and basses on their albums, including different Fenders, Gibsons, and Gretsches. In the fall of 2005, the tour van containing the band&#x27;s equipment (including Sune&#x27;s prized 1960 Jazzmaster and Sharin&#x27;s treasured Gretsch 6120) was stolen during their tour of the U.S.A.

<text>Turkish coffee is a style of coffee prepared in a &quot;cezve&quot; using very finely ground coffee beans without filtering or settling to remove the grounds.

==Preparation==
Turkish coffee is very finely ground coffee brewed by boiling. Any coffee bean may be used; arabica varieties are considered best, but robusta or a blend is also used. The coffee grounds are left in the coffee when served. The coffee may be ground at home in a manual grinder made for the very fine grind, ground to order by coffee merchants in most parts of the world, or bought ready-ground from many shops.
Coffee and water, usually with added sugar, is brought to the boil in a special pot called &quot;cezve&quot; in Turkey, and often called &quot;ibrik&quot; elsewhere. As soon as the mixture begins to froth, and before it boils over, it is taken off the heat; it may be briefly reheated twice more to increase the desired froth. Sometimes about one-third of the coffee is distributed to individual cups; the remaining amount is returned to the fire and distributed to the cups as soon as it comes to the boil. The coffee is traditionally served in a small porcelain cup called a &quot;&quot; &#x27;coffee cup&#x27;.

Another ancient tradition involves placing the cezve filled with coffee in a pan filled with hot sand. The pan is heated over an open flame, thereby letting the sand take total control of the heat. The heat created by the sand lets the coffee foam to the top almost immediately. The heat can also be adjusted by the depth of the cezve in the sand. This process is usually repeated three to four times and then the coffee is finally served in small cups called demitasse cups.

The amount of sugar is specified when ordering the coffee. It may be unsweetened (), with little or moderate sugar (, or ), or sweet (). Coffee is often served with something small and sweet to eat, such as Turkish delight. It is sometimes flavoured with cardamom, mastic, salep, or ambergris.
A lot of the powdered coffee grounds are transferred from the to the cup; in the cup, some settle on the bottom but much remains in suspension and is consumed with the coffee.

===According to connoisseurs===
In a paper for the 2013 Oxford Food Symposium, Tan and Bursa identified the features of the art or craft of making and serving Turkish coffee, according to the traditional procedures:

* Roasting. Ideally the best green Arabica beans are medium-roasted in small quantities over steady heat in a shallow, wrought-iron roasting pan. It is crucial to stop at the right moment, then transfer the beans to the next stage:

* Cooling. The beans are allowed to cool down in a wooden box and absorb excess oil. The kind of wood is claimed to affect the taste, walnut being the best.

* Pounding or grinding. The beans must be reduced into a very fine powder. The fineness of the powder is crucial to the success of Turkish coffee since it affects the foam and mouth feel. (According to one source, the particle size should be 75–125 microns.) Strict connoisseurs insist that they must be hand-pounded in a wooden mortar, although it is difficult to do this while achieving a uniform fineness. Consequently, it has become more usual to grind them in a brass or copper mill, though it does make for drier particles.

* Brewing. It is essential to use a proper &quot;cezve&quot;. This vessel is a conical flask, being wider at the base than at the neck, and is made of thick forged copper. (A common sized &quot;cezve&quot; will make one cup of coffee, and they can easily be ordered online in many western countries.) Cold water, several teaspoons of the ground coffee (at least 7 grams per person) and any sugar are put in the &quot;cezve&quot; and it is put on the fire. The tapering shape of the vessel encourages the formation of foam and retains the volatile aromas. The coffee should never be allowed to come to a rolling boil, and must not be over-done. &quot;This stage requires close monitoring and delicate timing since a good Turkish coffee has the thickest possible layer of froth at the top&quot;. Some think that the metallic copper helps to improve the taste.

* Serving. The &quot;cezve&quot; has a spout by which it is poured into the serving cup. While the cup design might not seem to have anything to do with the taste of the beverage, connoisseurs say it makes a difference. The best cups are made of porcelain with a thin rim: it affects mouth feel. A long cultural tradition emphasises the pleasure of being served coffee in beautiful cups, which are family heirlooms. The beverage is served together with a glass of water which should be sipped first to cleanse the mouth. Other cultural traditions affect the guest&#x27;s appreciation of the beverage and the conviviality of the occasion, including story-telling, fortune-telling, and so forth.

While some of these stages may be curtailed in modern coffee drinking, for example the coffee might be purchased already roasted and ground, the rituals and paraphernalia (e.g. the anticipatory smell of the roasting beans) do act on the imagination and have a psychological effect.

==History==
Coffee drinking spread in the Islamic world in the 16th century. From the Hijaz it arrived in Cairo; from thence it went to Syria and Istanbul. The coffee tree was first cultivated commercially in the Yemen, having been introduced there from the rainforests of Ethiopia where it grew wild. For a long time Yemenis had a world monopoly on the export of coffee beans (according to Carl Linnaeus, by deliberately destroying their ability to germinate). For nearly a century (1538–1636), the Ottoman Empire controlled the southern coastal region of the Yemen, notably its famous coffee port Mocha. In the 18th century Egypt was the richest province of the Ottoman Empire, and the chief commodity it traded was Yemeni coffee. Cairo merchants were responsible for moving it from the Yemen to markets in the Islamic world.

Coffee was in use in Istanbul by 1539, for a legal document mentions Ottoman admiral Barbaros Hayreddin Pasha&#x27;s house had a coffee chamber. It appears that the first coffeehouse in Istanbul was opened in 1554 (some say 1551) by Hakem of Aleppo and Șems of Damascus (they may have been separate establishments at first). Soon, coffeehouses spread all over Istanbul and even to small towns in Anatolia.

Ignatius d&#x27;Ohsson described for French readers the Turkish method of brewing coffee (, 1789). His description, translated in this note, closely resembles the present day version, including the production of foam. From the traveller Jean de Thévenot it appears Turks were using it at least a century before that. He mentions that they drank it black; some added cloves, cardamom or sugar, but it was thought to be less healthy, and until recently, an older generation of connoisseurs disdained the habit of sugaring Turkish coffee.

===Origin of the Turkish method===

There are inconsistent claims as to the origin of Turkish coffee. Without citing historical sources, some authors have asserted the method originated in the Yemen. or in Damascus (a plausible, if unsubstantiated claim, since the Middle Eastern coffeehouse did probably originate in Damascus and was brought to Istanbul by Syrians, see above); or with the Turkish people themselves.

Yemenis may have been the first to consume coffee as a hot beverage (instead of chewing the bean, or adding it to solid food) and the earliest social users were probably Sufi mystics in that region who needed to stay awake for their nocturnal vigils. However a 1762 Danish scientific expedition noted that Yemenis did not like coffee made the &quot;Turkish&quot; way, and rarely drank it, thinking it bad for the health: they much preferred &quot;kisher&quot;, a beverage made of the coffee shells which more closely resembled a tea; Likewise, according to scientist John Ellis (1774), French visitors to the Yemeni royal court noticed that only a version was drunk made from coffee husks with a colour like beer. In 1910, the U.S. consul at Aden reported and it has been said that Yemenis do not drink much coffee to this day.

If Turkish coffee is defined as &quot;a very strong black coffee served with the fine grounds in it&quot;, then the method is generic in Middle Eastern cities (in rural areas a different method is used and is called Arabic coffee) and goes by various other names too, such as Egyptian coffee, Syrian coffee, and so forth, though there may be some local variations.

===Illegality and acceptance===

The English word &quot;coffee&quot; derives from Turkish , which came from Arabic , which could mean . It is sometimes stated that coffee was forbidden in Islam, albeit the ban was not very effective. However, it seems most Muslim religious scholars actually supported coffee, or were not averse to it on principle. It was governments who wanted to suppress coffee gatherings, fearing they were foci of political dissent. &quot;What was condemned was not caffeine&#x27;s physiological effects but rather the freedom of coffeehouse talk which rulers considered subversive&quot;.

Already in 1543 several ships were ordered to be sunk in Istanbul harbour for importing coffee. Under Sultan Murad IV those found keeping a coffeehouse were cudgelled for a first offence, sewn in a bag and thrown into the Bosphorus for a second. These bans were sporadic and often ignored. (Similarly, the government of Charles II of England tried to suppress coffee houses as seditious gatherings - the ban lasted a few days - and, much later, the republican government of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk tried to prohibit or discourage coffeehouses in Turkish villages, saying they were places where men gathered to waste their time). Eventually the authorities found it to their advantage to tax the trade not suppress it. Fifteen years after coffee arrived in Istanbul there were over 600 coffeehouses, wrote an Armenian historian.

To prepare Turkish coffee very well is not easy, and prominent Ottoman Turks kept specialist coffee cooks for the purpose. Sultan Süleyman had a or chief coffee-cook, and it became a traditional practice for sultans. To demonstrate the civility of their rule, they built magnificent coffeehouses in newly conquered parts of the Ottoman Empire.

===International diffusion===
====Western Europe====

From the Ottoman Empire, coffee-drinking spread to western Europe, probably being first introduced into Venice, where it was consumed as a medicine. Early consumers were travellers who imported it for their own use. Other early users were &quot;virtuosi&quot;: gentleman-scholars curious about the outside world and willing to try exotic products. Since these early adopters were trying to recreate the genuine article, probably they were making proper Turkish coffee, or at least something like it. For example, Jean de Thévenot imported authentic &quot;ibriks&quot; from the Ottoman Empire.

However, most early modern Europeans did not like coffee, which is an acquired taste, and especially they did not like the black, bitter Turkish version. In any case it was too expensive: in France, coffee beans sold for the equivalent of $8,000 a kilo. Coffee did not become a popular beverage until it was altered to appeal to European palates and its price drastically lowered, as follows.

The Yemeni coffee monopoly was broken by the Dutch, who managed to obtain viable coffee plants from Mocha and propagated them to their empire in Java. They were followed by the French, who planted a tree at the Jardin des Plantes de Paris; it has been claimed that &quot;This tree was destined to be the progenitor of most of the coffee of the French colonies, as well as those of South America, Central America, and Mexico&quot;, i.e. most of the coffee in the world, though it has been called &quot;a neat story&quot;. By the time of the French Revolution, 80% of the world&#x27;s coffee was grown in the Americas and French coffee was ousting the Yemeni product in Cairo, even being exported back to Mocha itself. The price of coffee fell so much that by mid-18th century it was accessible to French townspeople of all classes.
When coffee was eventually popularised, what was served was not genuine Turkish coffee, but a product heavily diluted with water (much weaker than modern espresso) or milk, and sweetened with sugar. &quot;Combining coffee with fresh milk turned a Turkish drink into a French one&quot;. Already in 1689, in a paper for fellow scientists at the Royal Society, London, John Houghton though stressing coffee&#x27;s Ottoman origins, said very good coffee was made by boiling the grounds in plenty of water and letting them settle, leaving a clear, reddish liquor: which is not Turkish coffee.

Despite this, the &quot;Turkish&quot; connection was strongly promoted, since its exotic connotations helped the new drink to sell. Coffeehouse keepers wore turbans, or called their shops &quot;Turk&#x27;s Head&quot; and suchlike. Especially in France there was a craze for things Turkish: fashion plates depicted aristocratic ladies taking coffee while dressed as sultanas, attended by servants in Moorish costume. Its medical value was stressed: it became popular in France when doctors advised café au lait was good for the health. In England, the earliest advertisement (1652) for a coffee house — owned by Pasqua Rosée, an Armenian from Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) — claimed that Turkish people &quot;are not troubled with the Stone, Gout, Dropsie, or Scurvey&quot; and &quot;their skins are exceedingly cleer and white&quot;. Despite this, Rosée&#x27;s product was weak enough to be drunk a half pint (485 ml) at a time on an empty stomach, not an attribute of real Turkish coffee. If there were &#x27;Turkish&#x27; coffeehouses in Oxford or Paris, the cited historical sources do not show they were serving coffee made in the Turkish manner.

The real Ottoman influence was on European coffee house culture. &quot;The coffeehouse and café, far from being English and French creations, were at heart an import from Mecca, Cairo, and Constantinople&quot;, a topic outside the scope of this article.

====America====
The first person who brought coffee to America may have been Captain John Smith and, since he had been in Turkish service (he had been enslaved and given to a &quot;pasha&quot; mistress), conceivably he prepared it in the Turkish manner. Already by 1683 William Penn was complaining about the price of coffee in Pennsylvania.

===Decline===
In the 20th century, especially in wartime and the 1950s, shortages in Turkey meant that coffee was scarcely available for years at a time, or was adulterated with chickpeas and other substances. Habits changed; the old coffee culture declined; the epicurean coffee aficionado was less to be seen. Although still important in Turkish tradition, today Turks drink more tea than coffee. A survey of Turkish regions found that in some areas &quot;coffee&quot; was made without using coffee beans at all. By 2018 there were said to be over 400 Starbucks stores in Istanbul alone, and younger Turks were embracing third-wave coffee. The most popular brand in Turkey is Nescafé. However, UNESCO has inscribed Turkish coffee culture and tradition on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and &quot;there still exist serious aficionados who would never trade the taste of Turkish coffee with anything else&quot;.

==Culture==
===Fortune-telling===
The grounds left after drinking Turkish coffee are sometimes used to tell fortunes, a practice known as tasseography. The cup is turned over into the saucer to cool, and the patterns of the coffee grounds are interpreted.

===Turkish weddings===
As well as being an everyday beverage, Turkish coffee is also a part of the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom&#x27;s parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl&#x27;s family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be must prepare and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom&#x27;s coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl&#x27;s house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present from the girl. In some regions, however, &quot;if the coffee is brewed without any froth, it means &#x27;You have no chance!&#x27;&quot;

==Names and variants==

There is controversy about its name e.g. in some ex-Ottoman dependencies, mostly due to nationalistic feelings or political rivalry with Turkey.

===Within Turkey===
Dibek Coffee

Dibek Coffee is a type of Turkish coffee named after the traditional method used to grind the beans. Originally, “dibek” referred to two slightly indented stones used to crush roasted coffee beans by rubbing them together. Over time, the design of the dibek became deeper and more practical.

The roasted beans are crushed in the dibek using a wooden or iron hammer until they reach the desired size. Unlike finely powdered coffee, the coffee ground in a dibek has a coarse texture. This method preserves the aromatic oils in the coffee, enhancing its flavor and helping to maintain its foam during cooking.

Dibek Coffee is recognized as a local specialty in various regions of Türkiye. It is traditionally prepared in a coffeehouse in Kırklareli that has been operating for 142 years. It is also considered a local product in the Gökçeada district of Çanakkale and Zeytinliköy. Additionally, Dibek Coffee is highlighted as a gastronomic representative of İzmir and its surrounding areas, including Urla, Seferihisar, Sığacık, Çeşme, Alaçatı, and nearby villages.

Cilveli Coffee

Cilveli Coffee is made by adding a mixture of double-roasted ground almonds and two spices to foamy Turkish coffee in a cup. A spoon is served alongside the coffee, allowing the guest to first eat the almond mixture on top before drinking the coffee. The combination of the almond mixture and foam creates a unique flavor. Double-roasting the almonds prevents them from sinking to the bottom of the coffee.

Cilveli Coffee is a traditional type of Turkish coffee from Manisa. Historically, it was prepared for princes, and in Manisa, it is also part of marriage rituals. Young women would offer this coffee to show their approval of a suitor and his family during a visit.

===Armenia===
This type of strong coffee is a standard of Armenian households. The main difference is that cardamom is used in Armenian coffee. Armenians introduced the coffee to Corfu when they settled the island, where it is known as &quot;eastern coffee&quot; due to its Eastern origin. Corfu, which had never been part of the Ottoman holdings, did not have an established Ottoman coffee culture before it was introduced by the Armenians. According to &quot;The Reuben Percy Anecdotes&quot; compiled by journalist Thomas Byerley, an Armenian opened a coffee shop in Europe in 1674, at a time when coffee was first becoming fashionable in the West.

The term &quot;Turkish coffee&quot; is still used in many languages but in Armenian it is either called , or , referring to the traditional preparation done without milk or creamer. If unsweetened it is called &#x27;bitter&#x27; () in Armenia, but more commonly it is brewed with a little sugar (&quot;normal&quot;). Armenians will sometimes serve a plate of baklava, gata, or nazook alongside the coffee.

=== Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Lithuania ===
A beverage called or is very popular in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, although other forms of coffee preparation such as espresso have become more popular in the last few decades, decreasing the popularity of &#x27;. &#x27; is usually no longer served in cafés, but it is prepared in pubs and kiosks, and in homes. The Czech and Slovak form of Turkish coffee is different from Turkish coffee in Turkey, the Arab world or Balkan countries, since a is not used; instead the desired amount of ground coffee is put in a cup and boiling or almost boiling water is poured over it. In recent years, Turkish coffee is also made in a &quot;&quot; ( in Czech), but &quot;Turkish coffee&quot; usually means the method described above. Coffee is prepared in the same way in Poland and Lithuania.

===Greece===
In Greece, Turkish coffee was formerly referred to simply as &#x27;Turkish&#x27; (). But political tensions with Turkey in the 1950s led to the political euphemism &quot;Greek coffee&quot; (),&quot; which became even more popular after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974: &quot;[…] Greek–Turkish relations at all levels became strained, &#x27;Turkish coffee&#x27; became &#x27;Greek coffee&#x27; by substitution of one Greek word for another while leaving the Arabic loan-word, for which there is no Greek equivalent, unchanged.&quot; There were even advertising campaigns promoting the name &quot;Greek coffee&quot; in the 1990s. The name for a coffee pot remains either a () in mainland Greek or a () in Cypriot Greek.

===Former Yugoslavia===
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkish coffee is also called &quot;Bosnian coffee&quot; (), which is made slightly differently from its Turkish counterpart. A deviation from the Turkish preparation is that when the water reaches its boiling point, a small amount is saved aside for later, usually in a coffee cup. Then, the coffee is added to the pot (), and the remaining water in the cup is added to the pot. Everything is put back on the heat source to reach its boiling point again, which only takes a couple of seconds since the coffee is already very hot. Coffee drinking in Bosnia is a traditional daily custom and plays an important role during social gatherings.

In Serbia, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Croatia it is called &#x27;Turkish coffee&#x27;, &#x27;domestic coffee&#x27; or simply &#x27;coffee&#x27;. It is nearly identical to the Turkish version. In Serbia, Turkish coffee is also called (), which means &#x27;Serbian coffee&#x27;.

<text>Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll, 10th Earl of Argyll (25 July 1658 – September 1703) was a Scottish peer.

==Biography==
The eldest son of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll and Mary Stuart, daughter of James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray, Campbell sought to recover his father&#x27;s estates (by gaining King James VII&#x27;s favour). However, after failing to do so, he went to The Hague and supported William and Mary&#x27;s quest for the throne; this important support later led to the monarchs returning his father&#x27;s estate in 1690. In spite of the attainder, he was admitted in 1689 to the Convention of the Estates of Scotland as earl of Argyll, and he was deputed, with Sir James Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple, to present the crown to William in its name, and to tender him the coronation oath. Also, he was made a Privy Councillor. He was William&#x27;s chief Scottish advisor, and was colonel-in-chief of the Earl of Argyll&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, that was involved in the 1692 massacre of the MacDonalds of Glen Coe, but took no part in any of its field operations. In 1696 he was made a lord of the treasury, and was created a duke in 1701.

On 12 March 1678, he married Elizabeth Tollemache (daughter of Elizabeth and Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet) at Edinburgh, Scotland. Elizabeth&#x27;s stepfather John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale was a dominant figure in Scottish politics of the era. They had four children, born at Ham House outside London:

*John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (10 October 1680 – 4 October 1743)
*Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll (June 1682 – 15 April 1761)
*Lady Margaret Campbell (2 June 1690 – died bef 1703), not mentioned in father&#x27;s will
*Lady Anne Campbell (12 Jan 1692 – 20 October 1736), m. James Stuart, 2nd Earl of Bute

The 1st Duke of Argyll is buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

<doc id="482840" wikidata="Q465874" url="?curid=482840" title="Nicholas Longworth">
<text>Nicholas Longworth III (November 5, 1869 – April 9, 1931) was an American lawyer and politician who became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. A Republican, he was elected to the Ohio Senate, where he initiated the successful Longworth Act of 1902, regulating the issuance of municipal bonds. As congressman for Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district, he soon became a popular social figure of Washington, and married President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s daughter Alice Lee. Their relationship became strained when he opposed her father in the Republican Party split of 1912. Longworth became Majority Leader of the House in 1923, and Speaker from 1925 to 1931. 

In 1962, the Longworth House Office Building was named after him.

==Early years and education==
Longworth was the son of Nicholas Longworth II and Susan Walker. The Longworth family was an old, prominent, and wealthy family which dominated Cincinnati, Ohio. He had two younger sisters, Anna and Clara. Nicholas Longworth II was the son of Joseph Longworth and grandson of winemaker Nicholas Longworth I, both distinguished citizens of Cincinnati.

Nicholas Longworth III attended the Franklin School, a school for boys in Cincinnati, and then went on to attend Harvard College (Class of 1891), where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter) and the Porcellian Club. He was a talented, but not necessarily an industrious student; one friend wrote about him: &quot;His good head made it easy for him to get perfectly respectable marks without doing much of any work.&quot; After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard, he attended Harvard Law School for one year, but transferred to and received his law degree from Cincinnati Law School in 1894.

Longworth was a violinist, and on their first visit to Bayreuth, his wife Alice Lee Roosevelt reported that &quot;Nick was really a musician and cared deeply for music...&quot; Later she observed that &quot;In Washington, Nick never had much time to play his violin, and in those days there were very few people to play with him. In Cincinnati there were the orchestra, the College of Music, and the Conservatory to draw on, and soon we were having musical parties, at least once, and often two or three times a week. ... We would all have dinner first, the musicians and a few others who cared for music, and afterwards lose no time getting started, by about nine at the latest. From then on music and yet more music until midnight and usually long after.&quot; In a letter to Longworth&#x27;s sister Clara, Leopold Stokowski wrote &quot;Your brother had a rare understanding of music. He penetrated directly into the spirit of music. It was his natural element.&quot;

==Professional life and entry into politics==


Longworth began a law practice in Cincinnati after being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1894. His political career began with a position on the city&#x27;s Board of Education in 1898.

As the protégé of Republican boss George B. Cox, Longworth was elected to the Ohio General Assembly, serving in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1899 and 1900, then in the State Senate from 1901 to 1903. In 1902 he was instrumental in writing and passing the Longworth Act, a bill regulating the issuance of municipal bonds, which has been labeled &quot;one of the most successful laws in Ohio&#x27;s history.&quot; Longworth was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the First Congressional District of Ohio which included the city of Cincinnati and the surrounding counties.

Longworth, a bachelor when he entered Congress, married Alice Lee Roosevelt, the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, on February 17, 1906, in a White House wedding that received widespread public attention In 1925, Roosevelt gave birth to a daughter named Paulina Longworth, who was conceived from her affair with Senator William Borah. One family friend said of Paulina, &quot;everybody called her &#x27;Aurora Borah Alice. Biographers and historians have concluded that though Longworth was delighted with Paulina&#x27;s birth and doted on her, he almost certainly knew that Borah was her father. Longworth also had affairs, but the couple remained married, though Alice&#x27;s support for the progressive movement while Longworth sided with the conservative wing of the Republican Party caused a political rift between them.

Throughout his political career, Longworth championed issues regarding foreign affairs and the protective tariff. As the progressive Republicans pulled apart from the conservatives in 1910–12, Longworth sided with the conservatives. When they bolted from the party in the 1912 election to support Theodore Roosevelt and establish their own party, Longworth, along with many of Roosevelt&#x27;s closest political allies, remained firmly behind Republican standard-bearer President William Howard Taft. Longworth agreed more with Taft than Roosevelt on critical issues like an independent judiciary and support for business. As a result of the Republican Party rift, Longworth and his wife Alice found themselves on opposite sides of the divide in the fall campaign. She actively supported her father&#x27;s third-party presidential candidacy, even though her husband was running for reelection on the Republican ticket. Longworth narrowly lost his House seat to Democratic challenger Stanley E. Bowdle.

==Majority leader and Speaker of the House==
Longworth returned to Congress in 1915, after defeating Bowdle in an election rematch, and served until his death in 1931. He became House Majority Leader in 1923, and rose to speaker in 1925, succeeding Frederick Gillett, who had been elected to the Senate.

Soon after becoming speaker, he set out to restore to the speakership many of the powers that had been stripped away during the revolt against Joseph Cannon. He also punished 13 progressives who supported Robert M. La Follette instead of Calvin Coolidge in the 1924 election. He expelled the rebels from the GOP caucus, and stripped even the committee chairmen among them of all seniority. Additionally, Longworth took control of the Steering Committee and Committee on Committees and placed his own men on the Rules Committee, guaranteeing that he controlled the work of the House.

Ignoring the progressive wing of the party, Longworth pursued legislation that aimed for balanced budgets and major tax reductions, resisting any new programs that would expand the role of government. However, Longworth defied President Herbert Hoover in 1931 by supporting the long-stalled veterans bonus bill; it passed but Hoover vetoed it, setting up the Bonus March of 1932.

Longworth reached across the aisle to Democrats, forging a productive relationship with John Nance Garner, that party&#x27;s House minority leader, who relied upon informal methods to strengthen his party&#x27;s influence. He enjoyed a close rapport with Garner, who said of Longworth, &quot;I was the heathen and Nick was the aristocrat.&quot; Together they hosted a daily gathering of Democratic and Republican congressmen in a secluded room in the Capitol, which became known as the &quot;Bureau of Education.&quot; This unofficial club provided a place for politicians to relax with a drink and get to know and work with one another across party lines.

==Final days and death==
Longworth served as speaker until the end of the 71st Congress on March 4, 1931, and was speaker-presumptive for the upcoming 72nd Congress at the time of his death (as he had won reelection in November 1930 and as at the time Republicans retained a narrow 3-seat House majority). He died unexpectedly from pneumonia on April 9 while visiting his friend Dwight Filley Davis (of Davis Cup fame), and Daniel J. Duckett in Aiken, South Carolina. His body was subsequently interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. At a memorial service held at the Library of Congress on May 3, 1931, his old friends Efrem Zimbalist and Harold Bauer played Brahms&#x27;s D minor sonata.

==Character==
Donald C. Bacon described Longworth as &quot;Debonair and aristocratic, given to wearing spats and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was perpetually cheerful, quick with a joke or witty retort, and unfailingly friendly. He seemed never to have a care and made hard decisions with such ease and detachment that some people wondered if anything at all really mattered to him.&quot;

One particular famous retort is attributed to Longworth. One day, while he was lounging in a chair at the Capitol, another member of the House ran his hand over Longworth&#x27;s bald pate and commented, &quot;Nice and smooth. Feels just like my wife&#x27;s bottom.&quot; Longworth felt his own head and said: &quot;Yes, so it does.&quot;

Journalist Frank R. Kent of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote of him:

<text>In continuum mechanics, a power-law fluid, or the Ostwald–de Waele relationship, is a type of generalized Newtonian fluid. This mathematical relationship is useful because of its simplicity, but only approximately describes the behaviour of a real non-Newtonian fluid. Power-law fluids can be subdivided into three different types of fluids based on the value of their flow behaviour index: pseudoplastic, Newtonian fluid, and dilatant. A first-order fluid is another name for a power-law fluid with exponential dependence of viscosity on temperature. As a Newtonian fluid in a circular pipe give a quadratic velocity profile, a power-law fluid will result in a power-law velocity profile.

== Description ==
In continuum mechanics, a power-law fluid, or the Ostwald–de Waele relationship, is a type of generalized Newtonian fluid (time-independent non-Newtonian fluid) for which the shear stress, , is given by
:formula_1

where:
* is the &quot;flow consistency index&quot; (SI units Pa·s&quot;n&quot;),
* is the shear rate or the velocity gradient perpendicular to the plane of shear (SI unit s−1), and
* is the &quot;flow behavior index&quot; (dimensionless).

The quantity

:formula_2

represents an &quot;apparent&quot; or &quot;effective viscosity&quot; as a function of the shear rate (SI unit Pa s). The value of and can be obtained from the graph of formula_3 and formula_4. The slope line gives the value of , from which can be calculated. The intercept at formula_5 gives the value of formula_6.

Also known as the Ostwald–de Waele power law after Wilhelm Ostwald and Armand de Waele, this mathematical relationship is useful because of its simplicity, but only approximately describes the behaviour of a real non-Newtonian fluid. For example, if were less than one, the power law predicts that the effective viscosity would decrease with increasing shear rate indefinitely, requiring a fluid with infinite viscosity at rest and zero viscosity as the shear rate approaches infinity, but a real fluid has both a minimum and a maximum effective viscosity that depend on the physical chemistry at the molecular level. Therefore, the power law is only a good description of fluid behaviour across the range of shear rates to which the coefficients were fitted. There are a number of other models that better describe the entire flow behaviour of shear-dependent fluids, but they do so at the expense of simplicity, so the power law is still used to describe fluid behaviour, permit mathematical predictions, and correlate experimental data.

== Types ==
Power-law fluids can be subdivided into three different types of fluids based on the value of their flow behaviour index:
=== Pseudoplastic fluids ===
Pseudoplastic, or &quot;shear-thinning&quot; are those fluids whose behaviour is time independent and which have a lower apparent viscosity at higher shear rates, and are usually solutions of large, polymeric molecules in a solvent with smaller molecules. It is generally supposed that the large molecular chains tumble at random and affect large volumes of fluid under low shear, but that they gradually align themselves in the direction of increasing shear and produce less resistance.

A common household example of a strongly shear-thinning fluid is styling gel, which is primarily composed of water and a fixative such as a vinyl acetate/vinylpyrrolidone copolymer (PVP/PA). If one were to hold a sample of hair gel in one hand and a sample of corn syrup or glycerine in the other, they would find that the hair gel is much harder to pour off the fingers (a low shear application), but that it produces much less resistance when rubbed between the fingers (a high shear application).

This type of behavior is widely encountered in solutions or suspensions. In these cases, large molecules or fine particles form loosely bounded aggregates or alignment groupings that are stable and reproducible at any given shear rate. But these fluids rapidly and reversibly break down or reform with an increase or decrease in shear rate. Pseudo plastic fluids show this behavior over a wide range of shear rates; however often approach a limiting Newtonian behavior at very low and very high rates of shear. These Newtonian regions are characterized by the viscosities formula_7 and formula_8 respectively.

=== Newtonian fluids ===
A Newtonian fluid is a power-law fluid with a behaviour index of 1, where the shear stress is directly proportional to the shear rate:

:formula_9

These fluids have a constant viscosity, &quot;μ&quot;, across all shear rates and include many of the most common fluids, such as water, most aqueous solutions, oils, corn syrup, glycerine, air and other gases.

While this holds true for relatively low shear rates, at high rates most oils in reality also behave in a non-Newtonian fashion and thin. Typical examples include oil films in automotive engine shell bearings and to a lesser extent in geartooth contacts.

=== Dilatant fluids ===
Dilatant, or &quot;shear-thickening&quot; fluids increase in apparent viscosity at higher shear rates.

They are in common use in viscous couplings in automobiles. When both ends of the coupling are spinning at the same rotational speed, the viscosity of the dilatant fluid is minimal, but if the ends of the coupling differ in speed, the coupling fluid becomes very viscous. They are used to prevent all of the torque from going to one wheel when the traction on that wheel drops, e.g. when one wheel is on ice. The viscous coupling between the two driven wheels ensures that both wheels turn at the same rate, providing torque to the wheel that is not slipping. Viscous couplings are also used to keep the front axle and the rear axle spinning at the same rate in four-wheel drive passenger automobiles.

Dilatant fluids are rarely encountered in everyday situations. One common example is an uncooked paste of cornstarch and water, sometimes known as oobleck. Under high shear rates, the water is squeezed out from between the starch molecules, which are able to interact more strongly, enormously increasing the viscosity.

While not strictly a dilatant fluid, Silly Putty (viscoelastic fluid) is an example of a material that shares these viscosity characteristics.

== First-order fluid ==

A &quot;first-order fluid&quot; is another name for a power-law fluid with exponential dependence of viscosity on temperature.

: formula_10

where &quot;γ̇&quot; is the shear rate, &quot;T&quot; is temperature and &quot;μ&quot;0, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coefficients.

The model can be re-written as

: formula_11

== Velocity profile in a circular pipe ==

Just like a Newtonian fluid in a circular pipe gives a quadratic velocity profile, a power-law fluid will result in a power-law velocity profile,

:formula_12

where &quot;u&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is the (radially) local axial velocity, &quot;&quot; is the pressure gradient along the pipe, and &quot;R&quot; is the pipe radius.

<doc id="482844" wikidata="Q16951955" url="?curid=482844" title="Corteno">
<text>The Corteno or is a breed of sheep from the Val Camonica, in the province of Brescia in Lombardy, northern Italy. It is raised in the comune of Corteno Golgi, from which it takes its name, and in the neighbouring comuni of Edolo, Malonno and Paisco Loveno, all lying within the Comunità Montana di Valle Camonica. It is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.

==History==

The origin of the Corteno breed is unknown, but is probably shared with that of other lop-eared breeds of the Alpine region such as the Bergamasca, the Biellese and the Lamon. Numbers were estimated at 4000 in 1983, and at about 1600 in 1995. In 2006 the total number was estimated at 1500, of which 131 were registered in the herdbook. The conservation status of the breed was listed as &quot;critical&quot; by the FAO in 2007. In 2013 the number registered for the breed was 295.

==Use==

The meat of the Corteno is exceptionally fatty. It is traditionally used to produce Cuz, a local type of preserved meat. Whole carcases of wether mutton are boiled in a cauldron for five or six hours with salt and a little water; the meat is then put up in terracotta jars with more salt and sealed with the mutton-fat.

<doc id="482847" wikidata="Q2725132" url="?curid=482847" title="Panchagavya">
<text>Panchagavya or panchakavyam is a mixture used in traditional Hindu rituals that is prepared by mixing five ingredients. The three direct constituents are cow dung, cow urine, and milk; the two derived products are curd and ghee. These are mixed and then allowed to ferment. The Sanskrit word &quot;panchagavya&quot; means &quot;five cow-derivatives&quot;. When used in Ayurvedic medicine, it is also called cowpathy.

==Risks==
Proponents claim that cow urine therapy is capable of curing several diseases, including certain types of cancer, although these claims have no scientific backing. In fact, studies concerning ingesting individual components of panchagavya, such as cow urine, have shown no positive benefit, and significant side effects, including convulsion, depressed respiration, and death. Cow urine can also be a source of harmful bacteria and infectious diseases, including leptospirosis.

==Non-medicinal applications==
Panchgavya is used as a fertilizer and pesticide in agricultural operations. Proponents claim that it is a growth promoter in the poultry diet, that it is capable of increasing the growth of plankton for fish feed, and that it increases the production of milk in cows, increases the weight of pigs, and increases the egg laying capacity of poultry. It is sometimes used as a base in cosmetic products.

==Religious Customs==

It was reported by the Indian Antiquary in June 1895 (pages 168-169) that cow-dung had general use in Brahman purifications and was eaten by Hindus as an atonement for sin:

 &quot;Cow-dung and cow-urine, with milk, curds and butter, form the five cow-products, which are worshipped in South India. New earthen pots, are cleansed by pouring into them the five cow products - milk, curds, butter, dung and urine. The five pots are set on darba grass and worshipped. They are called the god Panchgavia, and the worshipper thinks on their merit and good qualities, lays flowers on them, and mentally presents them with a golden throne. Water is sprinkled and waved over them. They are crowned with coloured rice, and are mentally presented with jewels, rich dresses, and sandal wood. Flowers, incense, a burning lamp, plantains, and betel are offered, a low bow is made, and the following prayer repeated:

&quot;Panchgaviâ, forgive our sins and the sins of all beings who sacrifice to you and who drink you. You have come from the body of the cow; therefore I pray you to forgive my sins and to cleanse my body. Cleanse me, who offer you worship, from my sins. Pardon and save me.&quot;

After a second bow and the meditation of Hari, the five products are mixed in one cup; the priest drinks a little, pours it into the hollow hands of the worshippers and they drink. Nothing is so cleansing as this mixture. All Indians often drink it. The five nectars - milk, curds, butter, sugar and honey - are good, but much less powerful.&quot;

The ancient Mahabharata epic relates that Shri, the Hindu goddess of fortune and prosperity, invisibly resides in the urine and dung of cows.

<text>A gurdwara or gurudwara () is a place of assembly and worship in Sikhism, but its normal meaning is &quot;place of guru&quot; or &quot;home of guru&quot;. Sikhs also refer to gurdwaras as &quot;Gurdwara Sahib&quot;. People from all faiths and religions are welcomed in gurdwaras. Each gurdwara has a &quot;Darbar Sahib&quot; where the Guru Granth Sahib is placed on a (an elevated throne) in a prominent central position. Any congregant (sometimes with specialized training, in which case they are known by the term granthi) may recite, sing, and explain the verses from the Guru Granth Sahib, in the presence of the rest of the congregation.

All gurdwaras have a hall, where people can eat free lacto-vegetarian food served by volunteers at the gurdwara. They may also have a medical facility room, library, nursery, classroom, meeting rooms, playground, sports ground, a gift shop, and finally a repair shop. A gurdwara can be identified from a distance by tall flagpoles bearing the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag.

The best-known gurdwaras are in the Darbar Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab, including Golden Temple (Sri Harmandir Sahib), the spiritual center of the Sikhs and Akal Takht, the political center of the Sikhs.
==History==

=== Dharamsals ===

==== Origin ====
Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak was ordained directly by God to construct &quot;dharamsals&quot; (places of worship; meaning ‘abode of righteousness’), as per the B.40 Janamsakhi:

The above statement separates the institution of Sikh dharamsals from those of other faiths, ordaining it as an independent institution based upon Sikhism alone. The first centre was built in Kartarpur, on the banks of Ravi River in the Punjab region by the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak Dev in the year 1521. It now lies in the Narowal District of west Punjab (Pakistan). During the time of Guru Nanak, Sikh places of worship were known as dharamsals where &quot;kirtan&quot; was conducted by the early Sikh congregation.

The worship centres were built as a place where Sikhs could gather to hear the guru give spiritual discourse and sing religious hymns in the praise of . 

==== Spread ====
Guru Nanak would arrange early Sikh followers into various &quot;sangat&quot; congregations or parishes and instructed them to erect a dharamsal dedicated to spreading their Guru&#x27;s message and teachings in their local area.

Bhai Gurdas states the following:

Guru Nanak set-up an important dharamsal in the new-found Kartarpur after settling there. Other important dharamsals were located in Khadur, Goindwal, Ramdaspur, Tarn Taran, Kartarpur (Doaba) and Sri Hargobindpur, all of whom had been directly founded upon the instruction of a Sikh guru. When the Manji system and the later Masand systems of preachers and dioceses was set-up, they were directed to found a dharamsal in their dedicated area of missionary work. Passionate early Sikhs would found dharamsals at various places across the Indian subcontinent and in Afghanistan as a means of expressing their devotion to the faith. Udasis were commanded by Guru Hargobind and his successors to found dharamsals in the distant reaches of the subcontinent far from the nucleus of Sikh centrality and rejuvenate the abandoned, dilapidated, or struggling dharamsals which had been founded by Guru Nanak and his followers in faraway places, which struggled due to their extreme distance from the central Sikh authority located mainly in Punjab. Guru Tegh Bahadur founded new dharamsal centres during his missionary tours of the Malwa region of Punjab and in northeastern India. Dharamsals were also established on trade routes utilized by Sikh Khatri merchants, especially upon the routes between Chitagong-to-Kabul plus Agra-to-Burhampur.

==== Structure and operation ====
The dharamsals were simple constructions and modest buildings, usually just consisting of a single humble room to house the local devotees of a locality for prayers. This was especially true in the rural areas, villages, and small towns where most of the local Sikh congregations consisted of simple peasants with little means of wealth. They were not built upon a specific axis because Sikhs believe God is omnipresent and the entire Earth is divine and equally fitting as such. The Adi Granth was installed at dharamsals after its codification and introduction in 1604. The dharamsals likely did not contain intricate and ornate furniture, fittings, and other decorative accessories, unlike modern-day gurdwaras. Dharamsals incorporated a body of water for public bathing due to the importance placed upon &quot;isnan&quot; (customary bathing in the morning) in Sikhism. Wherever natural sources of water were not readily available, a &quot;baoli&quot; (step-well), bucket well, or &quot;rahat&quot; (Persian wheel) would be implemented and installed in the courtyard of the structure or near a pool of water. The dharamsals incorporated a &quot;langar&quot; (communal kitchen) and lodge, especially the ones on important highways and trade routes, where persons could eat and stay without discriminated based upon their religious or caste-background. This facilitated the fast spread of Sikhism throughout the Punjab. Some dharamsals contained a hospital ward where the sick and injured could receive treatment. Other dharamsals incorporated carpentry workshops to construct beds and other needed furniture. The dharamsals often contained a school where one could learn Gurmukhi, Sikh music, and interpretation of Sikh scriptures.

=== Gurdwaras ===
As the Sikh population continued to grow, Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh guru, introduced the word &quot;gurdwara&quot;. Gurdwaras evolved out of the earlier Dharamsal centres.

The etymology of the term &quot;gurdwara&quot; is from the words () (a reference to the Sikh gurus) and () (gateway in Punjabi), together meaning &#x27;the gateway through which the guru could be reached&#x27;. Thereafter, all Sikh places of worship came to be known as gurdwaras.

The use of &#x27;sahib&#x27;, as sometimes appended in the term &quot;Gurdwara Sahib&quot;, derives from a loanword of Arabic origin, meaning &quot;companion&quot; or &quot;friend&quot;.

Kanwarjit Singh Kang classifies gurdwaras into two distinct categories:

# Community gurdwaras - which are constructed by Sikhs to meet their religious and social requirements (includes ones constructed outside of India)
# Historical gurdwaras - which are constructed by Sikhs at sites of historical importance in the history of Sikhism (these gurdwaras tend to be more famous)
Some of the prominent Sikh shrines established by the Sikh gurus are:
* Nankana Sahib, established in the 1490s by first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev, Punjab, Pakistan.
* Sultanpur Lodhi, established in 1499 became the Sikh centre during Guru Nanak Dev time Kapurthala District, Punjab (India).
* Kartarpur Sahib, established in 1521 by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev, near River Ravi, Narowal, Punjab, Pakistan.
* Khadur Sahib, established in 1539 by the second Sikh Guru, Guru Angad Dev ji, near River Beas, Amritsar District, Punjab, India.
* Goindwal Sahib, established in 1552 by the third Sikh Guru, Guru Amar Das ji, near River Beas, Amritsar District Punjab, India.
* Sri Amritsar, established in 1577 By the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das ji, District Amritsar, Punjab India.
* Tarn Taran Sahib, established in 1590 by the fifth Sikh Guru, [Guru Arjan Dev ji], District Tarn Taran Sahib, Punjab India.
* Kartarpur Sahib, established in 1594 by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev, near river Beas, Jalandhar District, Punjab India.
* Sri Hargobindpur, established by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev, near river Beas, Gurdaspur District, Punjab India.
* Kiratpur Sahib, established in 1627 by the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind, near river Sutlej, Ropar District, Punjab, India.
* Anandpur Sahib, established in 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, near river Sutlej, Punjab, India.
* Paonta Sahib, established in 1685 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, near river Yamuna, Himachal Pradesh India.

By the early 20th century, a number of Sikh gurdwaras in British India were under the control of the Udasi mahants (clergymen). The Gurdwara Reform Movement of the 1920s resulted in Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee taking control of these gurdwaras.
===Panj Takht===
The which literally means five seats or thrones of authority, are five gurdwaras which have a very special significance for the Sikh community. They are result of the historical growth of the religion of Sikhism and represent the centers of power of the religion.
* Akal Takht Sahib, (the Throne of the Timeless One) established by Guru Hargobind in 1609 is situated in the complex of The Golden Temple, Amritsar, India
* Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, located in Anandpur Sahib, Punjab, India
* Takht Sri Damdama Sahib, located in Bathinda, Punjab, India
* Takhat Sri Harimandir Patna Sahib, in the neighborhood of Patna Sahib, Patna, Bihar, India
* Takht Sri Hazur Sahib, located on banks of the River Godavari in Nanded, Maharashtra, India.

==Description==
A gurdwara has a main hall called a darbar, a community kitchen called a , and other facilities. The essential features of a gurdwara are these public spaces, the presence of the holy book and eternal Sikh guru the Granth Sahib, the pursuit of the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Sikh code of conduct and convention), and the provision of daily services:
* : singing hymns from the Granth Sahib. Strictly speaking only Shabads from Guru Granth Sahib, Dasam Granth, and the compositions of Bhai Gurdas and Bhai Nand Lal, can be performed within a gurdwara.
* : religious discourse and reading of Gurbani from the Guru Granth Sahib, with its explanations. There are two types of discourse: and .
* and : providing a free community kitchen called a langar for all visitors, regardless of cultural, religious, regional, caste, or class affiliations.
Other ceremonies performed there include the Sikh marriage ceremony, ; some of the rites of the death ceremony, ; and most of the important Sikh Festivals. The , a Sikh processional singing of holy hymns throughout a community, begin and conclude at a gurdwara.

Gurdwaras around the world may also serve the Sikh community in other ways, including acting as libraries of Sikh literature and schools to teach children Gurmukhi, housing the Sikh scriptures, and organizing charitable work in the wider community on behalf of Sikhs. Many historical gurdwaras associated with the lives of the Sikh Gurus have a sarovar (eco-friendly pool) attached for bathing.

Gurdwaras have no idols or statues.

==Customs==

Many gurdwaras are designed to seat men on one side and women on the other, although designs vary, and the divided seating is far from mandatory. They do not generally sit together but on separate sides of the room, both at an equal distance from the Guru Granth Sahib, as a sign of equality. Worshippers are offered (sweet flour and ghee-based food offered as ) in the hall, which is usually given into cupped hands by a (gurdwara volunteer).

In the room, food is cooked and served by the volunteers in the community. Only lacto-vegetarian food is served in the langar hall, to suit the visitors from different backgrounds so that no person may be offended. All people belonging to different faiths sit together to share a common meal, regardless of any dietary restrictions. The main philosophy behind the is two-fold: to provide training to engage in and an opportunity to serve people from all walks of life, and to help banish all distinctions between high and low or rich and poor.

==Architecture==

Gurdwara buildings do not have to conform to any set architectural design. The only established requirements are: the installation of the Granth Sahib under a canopy or in a canopied seat, usually on a platform higher than the specific floor on which the devotees sit, and a tall Sikh pennant flag atop the building.

In the 21st century, more and more gurdwaras (especially within India) have been following the Harimandir Sahib pattern, a synthesis of Indo-Islamic and Sikh architecture. Most of them have square halls, stand on a higher plinth, have entrances on all four sides, and have square or octagonal domed sanctums usually in the middle. During recent decades, to meet the requirements of larger gatherings, bigger and better ventilated assembly halls, with the sanctum at one end, have become accepted style. The location of the sanctum, more often than not, is such as to allow space for circumambulation. Sometimes, to augment the space, verandahs are built to skirt the hall. A popular model for the dome is the ribbed lotus, topped by an ornamental pinnacle. Arched copings, kiosks and solid domelets are used for exterior decorations.

==Spiritual significance==

===Meditating by the Guru Granth Sahib===

It is the duty of all Sikhs to engage in personal and communal meditation, and the study of the holy scriptures. Meditating and understanding the meaning of texts from the Granth Sahib is important for the proper moral and spiritual development of a Sikh. One must study Gurmukhi script and be able to read Gurbani to understand the meaning of the text. A Sikh has to revert to the Granth Sahib for the all spiritual guidance in one&#x27;s life.

===Holy congregation and reflecting on Gurbani===

It is believed that a Sikh is more easily and deeply engrossed by Gurbani when engaged in congregation gatherings. For this reason, it is necessary for a Sikh to visit gurdwara. On joining the holy congregation, Sikhs should take part and obtain the benefit from the combined study of the holy scriptures. No one is to be barred from entering a gurdwara regardless of their religious or regional background and are welcomed in.

===Voluntary service (Seva)===

Seva is an important and prominent part of the Sikh religion. Dasvand forms a central part of Sikh belief (of Vand Chhako) and literally means donating ten percent of one&#x27;s harvest, both financial and in the form of time and service such as seva to the gurdwara and anywhere where help is needed. All Sikhs therefore get involved in this communal service whenever an opportunity arises. This in its simple forms can be: sweeping and washing the floors of the gurdwara, serving water and food (Langar) to or fanning the congregation, offering provisions or preparing food and doing other &#x27;house keeping&#x27; duties.

===Community life and other matters===

Sikhism offers strong support for a healthy communal life, and a Sikh must undertake to support all worthy projects which would benefit the larger community and promote Sikh principles. Importance is given to Inter-faith dialogue, support for the poor and weak; better community understanding and co-operation.

==Learning and other facilities==
Many gurdwaras also have other facilities for Sikhs to learn more about their religion, such as libraries, complexes for courses in Gurmukhi, Sikhism and Sikh scriptures, meeting rooms, and room-and-board accommodation for those who need it. Gurdwaras are open to all people, regardless of sex, age, sexuality or religion, and are generally open all hours of a day. Some gurdwaras also provide temporary accommodations () for visitors or devotees. The gurdwara also serves as a community centre and a guest house for travellers, occasionally a clinic, and a base for local charitable activities. Apart from morning and evening services, the gurdwaras hold special congregations to mark important anniversaries on the Sikh calendar. They become scenes of much éclat and festivity during celebrations in honour of the birth and death () anniversaries of the Gurus and Vaisakhi.

<doc id="482860" wikidata="Q338100" url="?curid=482860" title="John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll">
<text>Field Marshal John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll (June 1723 – 24 May 1806), styled Marquess of Lorne from 1761 to 1770, was a Scottish soldier and nobleman. After serving as a junior officer in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession, he was given command of a regiment and was redeployed to Scotland where he opposed the Jacobites at Loch Fyne at an early stage of the Jacobite Rebellion and went on to fight against them at the Battle of Falkirk Muir and then at the Battle of Culloden. He later became adjutant-general in Ireland and spent some 20 years as a Member of Parliament before retiring to Inveraray Castle.

==Military career==
Born the son of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and Mary Campbell (née Bellenden), the daughter of John Bellenden, 2nd Lord Bellenden of Broughton, Campbell was educated at a private school in London and commissioned as second lieutenant in the 21st Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1739. He was promoted to captain in 1741 and major in 1743. He became Member of Parliament for Glasgow Burghs in March 1744 but was immediately deployed to Flanders to serve in the War of the Austrian Succession.

Campbell became lieutenant colonel commanding the 30th Regiment of Foot early in 1745 and was redeployed to Scotland where he opposed the Jacobites at Loch Fyne in November 1745 at an early stage of the Jacobite Rebellion. He went on to see action under Lieutenant General Henry Hawley at the Battle of Falkirk Muir where the British cavalry was completely routed in January 1746. He also served under the Duke of Cumberland at the Battle of Culloden where the Jacobites were finally defeated in April 1746.In 1749 Campbell transferred to the command of the 42nd Regiment of Foot who were serving in Ireland: he went on to become adjutant-general in Ireland in 1754. Promoted to colonel on 10 November 1755, he became colonel of the 54th Regiment of Foot in December 1755 and colonel of the 14th Dragoons in April 1757. He was promoted to major-general on 25 August 1759 and to lieutenant general on 19 January 1761. He took the courtesy title of Marquess of Lorne, and stood down from the House of Commons on his disqualification from representing a Scottish seat, when his father became 4th Duke of Argyll on 15 April 1761. He became Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1762 and was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament for Dover, an English seat, in January 1765. He became colonel of the 1st Regiment of Foot later that year.

Campbell stood down from the House of Commons again when, on the formation of the Chatham Ministry, he was created Baron Sundridge in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in November 1766. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1767, succeeded his father as 5th Duke of Argyll in November 1770 and was promoted to full general on 24 March 1778. He went on to be colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Footguards in May 1782 and, having been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire on 6 May 1794, was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796.

In retirement Campbell lived at Inveraray Castle and became an expert on agricultural improvement with a seat on the Board of Agriculture; he was also first president of the Highland and Agricultural Society. He died on 24 May 1806 and was buried at Kilmun Parish Church.

==Marriage and children==
In 1759 Campbell married Elizabeth Gunning, widow of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton and mother of James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton and Douglas Hamilton, 8th Duke of Hamilton. She was later created Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon in her own right. They had five children:
* Lady Augusta Campbell (born 31 March 1760, died 22 June 1831)
* George John Campbell, Earl of Campbell (born 17 February 1763, died 9 July 1764)
* George William Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll (born 22 September 1768, died 22 October 1839)
* Lady Charlotte Susan Maria Campbell (born 28 January 1775, died 1 April 1861)
* John Douglas Edward Henry Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll (born 21 December 1777, died 25 April 1847)

<doc id="482862" wikidata="Q3285425" url="?curid=482862" title="O Cortiço">
<text>O Cortiço (titled in ) is an influential Brazilian novel written in 1890 by Aluísio Azevedo. The novel depicts a part of Brazil&#x27;s culture in the late 19th century, represented by a variety of colorful characters living in a single Rio de Janeiro tenement. It is written with the intention of belonging to the Realism movement leaning towards Naturalism, much like Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.

Azevedo&#x27;s &quot;The Slum&quot; tells the stories of Portuguese and other European immigrants, mulattos, and former African slaves living and working together in a single community. It explores the author&#x27;s intensely naturalistic beliefs, having various characters being defined and changed by their environment, race and social position.

Examples are: the division between the lackadaisical, yet passionate, mulattos and the hard-working, driven Portuguese immigrants, how the climate and culture of Brazil can slowly transform these immigrants&#x27; behavior in atavistic ways. In addition, the role of women is a key theme, with all female characters in one way or another revealing their purpose in the slum.

In 2013 the book became a musical on Brazilian Broadway starring Gabriel Boni Rodrigues and Rafael Morelli. Today the play is with Daniel Tupauan and Christian Coronel.

<text>The Molossidae, or free-tailed bats, are a family of bats within the order Chiroptera.
The Molossidae is the fourth-largest family of bats, containing about 110 species as of 2012. They are generally quite robust, and consist of many strong-flying forms with relatively long and narrow wings with wrinkled lips shared through their genus. Their strong flying form allows them to fly 60 miles per hour using tail winds and at altitudes over 10,000 feet. This makes them unique among bats, as they are the only bat family that withstands the elevation. They are widespread, being found on every continent except Antarctica. They are typically found in caves, abandoned mines, or tunnels.

==Common ancestry==
The family&#x27;s scientific name comes from the type genus &quot;Molossus&quot;, which in turn is from the Molossus breed of dogs.

The family&#x27;s common name is derived from a length of &quot;free&quot; tail, projecting beyond the end of the uropatagium—the membrane that connects the base of the tail to the hind legs.

Another common name for some members of this group, and indeed a few species from other families, is mastiff bat. The western mastiff bat (&quot;Eumops perotis&quot;), a large species from the southwestern United States and Mexico with wings over across, is perhaps one of the best known with this name. They are widespread, being found on every continent except Antarctica.

==Anatomy==
The tail is usually best seen when resting. A special ring of cartilage slides up or down the tail vertebrae by muscular action to stretch or retract the tail membrane. This gives many species a degree of fine tuning in their flight maneuvers to rival their day-flying ecological equivalents, such as swifts, swallows, and martins. As a result, these animals include the fastest-flying of all bat species among their number. The dental formula of free-tailed bats varies between species: 

Free-tailed bats are usually grey, brown, or black in color, with some exceptions. They range from in length, excluding the tail, and can weigh from , depending on species. They are insectivorous, and catch their food on the wing. While some species roost in small groups in hollow trees or rocky crevices, some cave-dwelling species form vast colonies of up to 50 million individuals.

Molecular sequence data support the monophyly of the Molossidae as a whole, but not that of many of its genera, such as &quot;Chaerephon&quot;, &quot;Mops&quot;, &quot;Mormopterus&quot;, and &quot;Tadarida&quot;. The grouping of &quot;Chaerephon&quot; minus &quot;C. jobimena&quot; plus &quot;Mops&quot; was found to be monophyletic, as was &quot;Otomops&quot;.

==Systematics==

A 2012 study attempted to show the relationships of genera within the subfamily Molossinae (the other subfamily of Molossidae, Tomopeatinae, only contains the blunt-eared bat).
This study used genetic data to create a phylogeny, which contrasted from previous phylogenies constructed using morphological data.
Traits that were previously used to group species, such as having a flat skull, were shown to have no relation to evolutionary relationship, meaning that flat-headedness evolved multiple times within the family.
Of the 16 genera of Molossinae, 15 were used to create the phylogeny (left), with researchers unable to include Peters&#x27;s flat-headed bat, the only member of &quot;Platymops&quot;.

The results of this study showed that &quot;Chaerephon&quot; is paraphyletic, forming a clade with &quot;Mops&quot;.
There was strong support for Old World and New World clades.
While the genus &quot;Tadarida&quot; has one New World species, the Mexican free-tailed bat, the genus itself has its origins in the Old World.
The most recent common ancestor of &quot;Tadarida&quot; with New World genera was 29 million years ago.
Several tribes have been proposed within the Molossinae.
Ammerman &quot;et al.&quot; proposed Molossini (containing &quot;Molossus&quot;, &quot;Eumops&quot;, &quot;Molossops&quot;, &quot;Cynomops&quot;, &quot;Neoplatymops&quot;, &quot;Nyctinomops&quot;, and &quot;Promops&quot;); Tadarini (containing &quot;Tadarida&quot;, &quot;Chaerephon&quot;, &quot;Mops&quot;, &quot;Platymops&quot;, &quot;Sauromys&quot;, &quot;Myopterus&quot;, and &quot;Otomops&quot;); Cheiromelini (containing &quot;Cheiromeles&quot;); and Mormopterini (containing &quot;Mormopterus&quot;)

<text>Inveraray Castle ( ; Scottish Gaelic &quot;Caisteal Inbhir Aora&quot; ) is a country house near Inveraray in the county of Argyll, in western Scotland, on the shore of Loch Fyne, Scotland&#x27;s longest sea loch. It is one of the earliest examples of Gothic Revival architecture.

It has been the seat of the Dukes of Argyll, chiefs of Clan Campbell, since the 18th century.

== History and architecture ==
James V stayed at the old castle of Inveraray in September 1533. A new lute was bought for him in Glasgow and carried to Inveraray by his servant Troilus.

The present castle was built in the Gothic Revival style. Improvements on the estate began in 1743 by Archibald Campbell, Earl of Ilay, soon to become 3rd Duke of Argyll. The foundation stone of the new castle was laid in October 1746, and it replaced an earlier 15th-century castle.

It is one of the earliest Gothic Revival buildings, together with Strawberry Hill House. It was built of ashlar lapis ollaris. Originally, all the roofs were flat and crenellated. Later, a third floor with pitched roof and dormer windows was added on all four wings, and steep conical roofs were added to the four round towers. In the 1770s, the village of Inveraray was demolished and rebuilt a short distance away, to give the castle a more secluded setting.

Designers who worked on the new castle include William Adam and Roger Morris. The interior has a number of neoclassical rooms created later in the 18th century for the 5th Duke by Robert Mylne. These are among the rooms open to the public. James Lees-Milne was not impressed by the house when he visited it in 1943, noting the &quot;ugly&quot; grey stone and calling it &quot;grim and forbidding&quot;.

In 1975 a devastating fire struck Inveraray and for some time the 12th Duke and his family lived in the castle&#x27;s basement, while restorations were carried out, funded by a worldwide fundraising drive.

== Modern era ==
The castle is open to visitors. Its collection includes more than 1,300 pikes, muskets, swords and other weapons. His Grace The 13th Duke of Argyll and his family live in private apartments in the castle, which occupy two floors and are set between two of the four crenellated circular towers. Recent renovations included the installation of the house&#x27;s first central heating system, powered by burning wood-chips from the family&#x27;s forestry holdings. It was previously heated only by open fires.

Inveraray Castle is a Category A listed building. It is surrounded by a garden and an estate of . Besides welcoming visitors to the castle, the estate&#x27;s activities include commercial forestry, tenanted farming, wind and hydro power, and deer stalking.

== In popular culture ==
The castle has featured in a number of media productions including: &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2012); &quot;Great Estates Scotland&quot; (2014); and Susan Calman&#x27;s &quot;Secret Scotland&quot; (2020). The &quot;Best of the West&quot; festival, organised by the Duchess, was held at the castle each September until 2018. Other productions included &quot;An American Aristocrat&#x27;s Guide to Great Estates&quot;, the BBC miniseries &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot;, and &quot;The Diplomat&quot; (2024).

The castle is reputedly haunted.

<text>Stephen Ray Mariucci (born November 4, 1955), nicknamed &quot;Mooch&quot;, is an American sportscaster and former football coach who was the head coach of two National Football League (NFL) teams, the San Francisco 49ers (1997–2002) and the Detroit Lions (2003–2005), and for a year at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Early life==
Mariucci was born and raised in Iron Mountain, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, where he met best friend and current Michigan State University basketball head coach Tom Izzo. Both attended Iron Mountain High where they were teammates on the football, basketball, and track teams.

At Northern Michigan University (NMU) in Marquette, where they were roommates, Mariucci was a three-time All-America (Division II) quarterback. As a sophomore in 1975, he led the Wildcats to three postseason wins and the national championship. Mariucci signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in but was released a month later 

==Early career==
He began his coaching career at his alma mater (1978–79), and moved to Cal State Fullerton and Louisville Mariucci&#x27;s first pro position was as a receivers coach for the USFL&#x27;s Orlando Renegades in 1985. Later that fall, he had a brief stint in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams as quality control coach.

Mariucci returned to college football and joined the USC staff in 1986 and coached wide receiver Ken Henry to a season where he had 807 yards with 7 TDs; WR Randy Tanner also had 408 yards 

He then moved to the coaching staff at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal) in 1987. that first season, WR Brian Bedford had 515 yards with 4 TDs and WR Mike Ford had 479 yards In 1989, WR Brian Treggs had 746 yards 

In 1990 and 1991, he was the Golden Bears&#x27; offensive coordinator. Quarterback Mike Pawlawski threw for 2,069 yards with 17 TDs and RBs Anthony Wallace and Russell White combined to run for 2,002 yards with 16 TDs. In 1991, Pawlawski threw for 2,517 yards with 21 TDs and White ran for 1,177 yards with 14 TDs; WR Sean Dawkins had 723 yards 

Mariucci then moved to the NFL, and became the quarterback coach for the Green Bay Packers in 1992 under new head coach After four years with the Packers, he returned to Cal as head coach in 1996 and went ending with an Aloha Bowl loss 

==Coaching career in professional football==

Following his season with the Golden Bears, Mariucci was considered a leading candidate for several NFL head coaching positions, and was hired by the San Francisco 49ers to succeed George Seifert.

In his first season in 1997, the 49ers went during the regular season, earning home-field advantage in the playoffs in the National Football Conference (NFC). After defeating the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional round, San Francisco hosted the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, but lost 23–10 in a muddy, rainy contest at Candlestick Park. The defeat was the 49ers&#x27; fourth NFC title loss of the 1990s, following losses to the New York Giants in 1990 and the Dallas Cowboys in 1992 and 1993, and it was their third playoff loss to the Packers in as many seasons. In 1998, the 49ers posted a 12–4 record and returned to the playoffs as a wild-card team, finally beating the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card game, but lost 20–18 in the divisional round to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons. The Wild Card Game saw Terrell Owens drop several passes but redeem himself with The Catch II, scoring the winning touchdown. Two highly disappointing seasons followed, with the team finishing and in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The 49ers bounced back in 2001, posting record and returning to the playoffs, only to be eliminated by the Green Bay Packers.

Mariucci&#x27;s final season in San Francisco was 2002. The 49ers won the NFC West with a record and beat the New York Giants in a wild-card game, posting the third-biggest comeback playoff victory in NFL history (second biggest at the time). However, they were crushed by the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the divisional round. On January 15, 2003, the 49ers fired Mariucci, reportedly after Mariucci lost a power struggle with general manager Terry Donahue. As San Francisco&#x27;s coach, he compiled a 60–43 (.583) record, while his teams earned playoff berths four times. His firing caused an uproar among 49ers fans. The 49ers struggled heavily following Mariucci&#x27;s departure, finishing without a winning season for the subsequent eight seasons.

Mariucci was named the Detroit Lions&#x27; 22nd head coach on February 4, 2003, and was fired on November 28, 2005. In his abbreviated three seasons in Detroit, he compiled a disappointing record. Mariucci&#x27;s troubles in Detroit were partially attributed by many fans and experts to poor personnel evaluations by then Lions&#x27; general manager Matt Millen, who had signed Mariucci to a five-year $25 million guaranteed contract, the NFL&#x27;s highest coaching contract at the time. During his time in Detroit, the Lions finished no higher than third in their division and never contended for a playoff berth. The decision to fire Mariucci came after a blowout loss on national television on Thanksgiving Day to the Atlanta Falcons in 2005.

During the Brett Favre–Green Bay Packers dispute throughout the 2008 off-season, Favre criticized the Packers for not interviewing Mariucci for their head coaching job in 2006. Mariucci, who previously worked with Favre, was figured to be a great candidate for the West Coast Offense style played in Green Bay.

Mariucci is one of thirteen head coaches since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 to lead his team to a division title in his first season. Mariucci established an NFL mark for consecutive wins by a rookie head coach with an 11-game winning streak, which has since been trumped by Jim Caldwell&#x27;s start with the Indianapolis Colts during the 2009 season.

Throughout his career, Mariucci coached a high number of players (9) inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Hall of Fame inductees coached by Mariucci as either their position or head coach include: Tony Gonzalez, Brett Favre, Steve Young, Jerry Rice, Kevin Greene, Rod Woodson, Chris Doleman, Charles Haley, and Terrell Owens.

==After coaching==
Since being fired by the Detroit Lions, Mariucci has not returned to coaching. He has since been hired by NFL Network to work on their show &quot;NFL GameDay&quot; and contribute as an analyst on NFL Network&#x27;s four-hour pregame show &quot;NFL GameDay Morning,&quot; as well as provide follow-up reports from the late afternoon and Sunday night matchups on &quot;NFL GameDay Highlights.&quot;

Mariucci now resides in Monte Sereno, California. He has four children: Stephen, Tyler, Adam, and Brielle. His eldest son Tyler is an assistant athletic director at San Diego State University. Adam works in Real Estate in New York City and his son Stephen is country music artist, Stephen Ray.

In 2011, Mariucci founded the Mariucci Family Foundation. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing opportunities and support for underserved youth and families.

Shortly after Pete Carroll left University of Southern California (USC), Mariucci was reportedly seen on campus, and ESPN&#x27;s Adam Schefter reported shortly thereafter that Mariucci was a candidate for the Trojans head coach position and that the university had &quot;made contact&quot; with the announcer.

Following the dismissal of Arkansas head coach Bobby Petrino in April 2012, Mariucci was recommended as a replacement by Carroll.

Mariucci expressed interest in the head coaching job of the San Diego Chargers in late 2012 with speculation of Norv Turner&#x27;s departure from San Diego.

<text>Sulfites or sulphites are compounds that contain the sulfite ion (systematic name: sulfate(IV) ion), . The sulfite ion is the conjugate base of bisulfite. Although its acid (sulfurous acid) is elusive, its salts are widely used.

Sulfites are substances that naturally occur in some foods and the human body. They are also used as regulated food additives. When in food or drink, sulfites are often lumped together with sulfur dioxide.

==Structure==
The structure of the sulfite anion can be described with three equivalent resonance structures. In each resonance structure, the sulfur atom is double-bonded to one oxygen atom with a formal charge of zero (neutral), and sulfur is singly bonded to the other two oxygen atoms, which each carry a formal charge of −1, together accounting for the −2 charge on the anion. There is also a non-bonded lone pair on the sulfur, so the structure predicted by VSEPR theory is trigonal pyramidal, as in ammonia (NH3). In the hybrid resonance structure, the S−O bonds are equivalently of bond order one and one-third.

Evidence from 17O NMR spectroscopic data suggests that protonation of the sulfite ion gives a mixture of isomers:

==Commercial uses==
Sulfites are used as a food preservative or enhancer. They may come in various forms, such as:
* Sulfur dioxide, which is not a sulfite, but a closely related chemical oxide
* Potassium bisulfite or potassium metabisulfite
* Sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite or sodium sulfite

===Wine===
Sulfites occur naturally in all wines to some extent. Sulfites are commonly introduced to arrest fermentation at a desired time, and may also be added to wine as preservatives to prevent spoilage and oxidation at several stages of the winemaking. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) protects wine not only from oxidation, but also from bacteria.

Organic wines are not necessarily sulfite-free, but generally have lower amounts and regulations stipulate lower maximum sulfite contents for these wines. In general, white wines contain more sulfites than red wines and sweeter wines contain more sulfites than drier ones.

In the United States, wines bottled after mid-1987 must have a label stating that they contain sulfites if they contain more than 10 parts per million (ppm).
In the European Union an equivalent regulation came into force in November 2005. This includes sulfur dioxide, and the limit is on the milligrams per kilogram or per litre of sulfur dioxide equivalent. In 2012, a new regulation for organic wines came into force. In the United Kingdom, similar laws apply. Bottles of wine that contain over 10 mg/L (ppm) of &quot;sulfites&quot; (or sulfur dioxide) are required to bear &quot;contains sulphites&quot; on the label. This does not differ if sulfites are naturally occurring or added in the winemaking process.

===Other foods===
Sulfites are often used as preservatives in dried fruits, preserved radish, and dried potato products.

Most beers no longer contain sulfites, although some alcoholic ciders contain them. Although shrimp are sometimes treated with sulfites on fishing vessels, the chemical may not appear on the label. In 1986, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States banned the addition of sulfites to all fresh fruit and vegetables that are eaten raw.

===E numbers===
E numbers for sulfites as food additives are:

==Health effects==
Allergic reactions to sulfites appear to be very rare in the general population, but more common in hyperallergic individuals.

Sulfites are counted among the top nine food allergens, but a reaction to sulfite is not a true allergy. Some people have positive skin allergy tests to sulfites indicating true (IgE-mediated) allergy. Chronic skin conditions in the hands, perineum, and face have been reported in individuals that regularly use cosmetics or medications containing sulfites. Occupational exposure to sulfites has been reported to cause persistent skin symptoms.

It may cause breathing difficulty within minutes after eating a food containing it. Asthmatics and possibly people with salicylate sensitivity (or aspirin sensitivity) are at an elevated risk for reaction to sulfites. Anaphylaxis and life-threatening reactions are rare. Other potential symptoms include sneezing, swelling of the throat, hives, and migraine.

A 2017 study has shown negative impacts of sulfites on bacteria found in the human microbiome.

== Use and labeling regulations ==
In 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites as preservatives on foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as salad ingredients). This has contributed to the increased use of erythorbic acid and its salts as preservatives.
They also cannot be added to foods high in vitamin B1 such as meats because sulfites can destroy vitamin B1 from foods

Generally, U.S. labeling regulations do not require products to indicate the presence of sulfites in foods unless it is added specifically as a preservative; still, many companies voluntarily label sulfite-containing foods. Sulfites used in food processing (but not as a preservative) are required to be listed if they are not incidental additives (21 CFR 101.100(a)(3)), and if there are more than 10 ppm in the finished product (21 CFR 101.100(a)(4))

Sulfites that are allowed to be added in food in the US are sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite.
Products likely to contain sulfites at less than 10 ppm (fruits and alcoholic beverages) do not require ingredients labels, and the presence of sulfites usually is undisclosed.

In Australia and New Zealand, sulfites must be declared in the statement of ingredients when present in packaged foods in concentrations of 10 mg/kg (ppm) or more as an ingredient; or as an ingredient of a compound ingredient; or as a food additive or component of a food additive; or as a processing aid or component of a processing aid.

Sulfites that can be added to foods in Canada are potassium bisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, sodium bisulfite, sodium dithionite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, sulfur dioxide and sulfurous acid. These can also be declared using the common names sulfites, sulfates, sulfiting agents.

In the European Union, &quot;EU law requires food labels to indicate &quot;contains sulfites&quot; (when exceeding 10 milligrams per kilogram or per litre) without specifying the amount&quot;.

==Metabolic diseases==
High sulfite content in the blood and urine of babies can be caused by molybdenum cofactor deficiency disease which leads to neurological damage and early death unless treated. Treatment, requiring daily injections, became available in 2009.

<doc id="482875" wikidata="Q1552951" url="?curid=482875" title="Alliance of the New Citizen">
<text>The Alliance of the New Citizen (, ANO) was a liberal political party in Slovakia existing from 2001 to 2011. The acronym was a pun on &quot;áno&quot;, Slovak for &quot;yes&quot;. It was founded and led by media entrepreneur Pavol Rusko. The party positioned itself as liberal and was a member of international liberal organisations. It was part of the centre-right governing coalition of Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda from October 2002 to September 2005.

After its first election, its populist appeal waned and it developed a more liberal approach.

ANO was legally renamed and thus succeeded (but not in terms of personnel or political positions) by the Free Word Party of Nora Mojsejová (, SSS-NM) in November 2011, when Eleonóra Mojsejová a Slovak businesswoman and TV personality took over the party. The party changed its name to CITIZENS () in 2013 and in 2014 to IDEA. It was finally dissolved in 2017. Its last president was Miroslav Leňo.

==Foundation ==
The party was founded in 2001 as the Alliance of the New Citizen (ANO). It was the first modern political party in Slovakia to consider itself to be liberal. Its leader Pavol Rusko was also the founder and former owner of Markíza (the biggest commercial TV channel in Slovakia). Rusko at first thought to join the Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) which was part of the previous government, yet after some bad blood, around January 2001 Rusko decided to create a new political party.

==Elections and government participation==
In August 2002, Pavol Rusko claimed that the party is financed completely from his own money, and the money of his close friend, businessman Ján Kováčik who borrowed the party an undisclosed sum of money. Rusko estimated the cost of the political party to 25 million Slovak korunas so far, with an additional 15 million expected for the campaign before the 2002 Slovak parliamentary election. In the election, the party finished sixth, gaining 230,309 votes (8.01% total) and capturing 15 out of 150 seats in the National Council of the Slovak Republic.

ANO was a member of the government coalition together with SDKÚ, SMK-MKP and KDH from October 2002 to September 2005, when it was expelled from the coalition after disputes with both SDKÚ and KDH. The party remained in opposition until the next parliamentary election but a group of MPs around Ľubomír Lintner continued to support the government.

The following ANO nominees were part of the Second Mikuláš Dzurinda government:
* Deputy Prime Minister - Robert Nemcsics (16 October 2002 — 9 September 2003)
* Deputy Prime Minister - Pavol Rusko (23 September 2003 — 24 August 2005)
* Deputy Prime Minister - Jirko Malchárek (4 October 2005 — 4 July 2006)
* Minister of Industry - Robert Nemcsics (16 October 2002 — 9 September 2003)
* Minister of Industry - Pavol Rusko (23 September 2003 — 24 August 2005)
* Minister of Culture - Rudolf Chmel (16 October 2002 — 24 May 2005)
* Minister of Culture - (24 May 2005 — 5 April 2006)
* Minister of Culture - Rudolf Chmel (5 April 2006 — 4 July 2006)
* Minister of Health - Rudolf Zajac (16 October 2002 — 4 July 2006)

In March 2003 an internal conflict started within the party between its leader Pavol Rusko and Economy Minister Robert Nemcsics and Deputy Transport Minister Branislav Opaterný. The party&#x27;s regional organizations unanimously supported Rusko and the party&#x27;s regional board meetings unambiguously called on both Nemcsics and Opaterný to abdicate from their positions and give up their deputy mandates.

On 6 March 2006, Jirko Malchárek, and Alexandra Novotná created a new political party Hope.

In the parliamentary election of June 17, 2006, the party won only 1.42% of the popular vote and lost parliamentary representation. It did not take part in other elections and slowly fell into obscurity.

==Successor parties==
In 2011 the party was bought by a known Slovak businesswoman Nora Mojsejová who did not have to collect thousands of signatures needed by law to register a new political party. If a party that is already registered changes its name, no signatures are necessary. Mojsejová changed its name to Free Word Party of Nora Mojsejová and entered the 2012 Slovak parliamentary election where she received 1.22% of votes, not winning any seats in the National Council but finishing ahead of long-time Slovak Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).

In 2013 party changed its name to CITIZENS. In 2014 party changed again its name to IDEA and new president became Miroslav Leňo.

==Party leadership==
* 2001–07 Pavol Rusko
* 2007–11 Robert Nemcsics
* 2011–13 Eleonóra Mojsejová
* 2013–14 Miroslav Mišánik
* 2014–17Miroslav Leňo

<doc id="482876" wikidata="Q4470201" url="?curid=482876" title="John Griffin, 4th Baron Howard de Walden">
<text>Field Marshal John Griffin Griffin, 4th Baron Howard de Walden, KB (13 March 1719 – 25 May 1797), was a British Army officer, politician and peer. He served as a junior officer with the Pragmatic Army in the Dutch Republic and Germany during the War of the Austrian Succession. After changing his surname to Griffin in 1749, he commanded a brigade at the Battle of Corbach in July 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He also commanded a brigade at the Battle of Warburg and was wounded at the Battle of Kloster Kampen.

==Early life==

He was born John Griffin Whitwell, the son of William Whitwell by his wife Anne Griffin, sister and sole heiress of Edward Griffin, 3rd Baron Griffin of Braybrooke, and granddaughter of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk and 3rd Baron Howard de Walden (1619–1689).

==Career==
Whitwell was educated at Winchester College and commissioned as an ensign in the 3rd regiment of Foot Guards and lieutenant in the Army in 1739. He served with the Pragmatic Army in the Low Countries and Germany during the War of the Austrian Succession and was promoted to captain in his regiment and lieutenant colonel in the Army in March 1744.

Whitwell&#x27;s aunt Elizabeth, Countess of Portsmouth agreed to leave him her interest in Audley End House if he changed his surname to Griffin: he did so in 1749, by Act of Parliament, becoming John Griffin Griffin. He became Member of Parliament for Andover in November 1749. Promoted to colonel on 29 May 1756 he became first major of his regiment on 9 May 1758. Promoted to major-general on 12 September 1759, he became colonel of the 50th Regiment of Foot in October 1759 and colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot in May 1760.

Griffin commanded a brigade of at least four battalions at the Battle of Corbach in July 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. At Corbach, following the arrival of French reinforcements from Frankenberg, the allied army was forced to withdraw. He also commanded a brigade at the Battle of Warburg later that month where the allied army were more successful. He was present and wounded at the Battle of Kloster Kampen in October 1760.

Griffin was appointed Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath on 11 April 1761 and inherited Audley End House outright when his aunt died in 1762. Promoted to lieutenant-general on 26 March 1765, he became colonel of the 1st Troop, Horse Grenadier Guards in March 1766 and was promoted to full general on 14 April 1778. During the political crisis in the early 1780s at the end of the American Revolutionary War he was generally a supporter of William Pitt the Younger.

Pitt arranged for the Barony of Howard de Walden to be called out of abeyance in Griffin&#x27;s favour, so elevating him to the House of Lords, on 3 August 1784 and for Griffin to be appointed Lord Lieutenant of Essex in November 1784. Griffin became colonel of the 4th Dragoons in March 1788, was additionally created 1st Baron Braybrooke on 30 August 1788 and was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796. He died on 25 May 1797.

==Family==

In 1749 he married Anna Maria Schutz and in 1765 he married Catherine Clayton; there were no children from either marriage.

<text>Nicholas Culpeper (18 October 1616 – 10 January 1654) was an English botanist, herbalist, physician and astrologer. His book &quot;The English Physitian&quot; (1652, later &quot;Complete Herbal&quot;, 1653 ff.) is a source of pharmaceutical and herbal lore of the time, and &quot;Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick&quot; (1655) one of the most detailed works on medical astrology in Early Modern Europe. Culpeper catalogued hundreds of outdoor medicinal herbs. He scolded contemporaries for some of the methods they used in herbal medicine: &quot;This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, and , and took a voyage to visit my mother , by whose advice, together with the help of , I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by , a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it.&quot;

Culpeper came from a line of notabilities, including the courtier Thomas Culpeper, who was reputed to be a lover of Katherine Howard (also a distant relative, her mother was Joyce Culpeper), the fifth wife of Henry VIII.

==Biography==
Culpeper was the son of Nicholas Culpeper (senior), a cleric. Shortly after his birth his father died and he was taken to Isfield, the home of his maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Attersoll, where he was brought up by his mother. Attersoll was an influence on the young boy&#x27;s political and religious beliefs and taught him both Latin and Greek. As a boy Culpeper became interested in astronomy, astrology, time, his grandfather&#x27;s collection of clocks, and medical texts in Attersoll&#x27;s library. Meanwhile his grandmother introduced him to the world of medicinal plants and herbs. He would go on, throughout his life, spending time in the countryside cataloguing plants.

From the age of 16 he studied at Cambridge, but it is not known at which college, although his father studied at Queens&#x27;, and his grandfather was a member of Jesus College. He was then apprenticed to an apothecary. After seven years his master absconded with the money paid for the indenture, and soon after, Culpeper&#x27;s mother died of breast cancer.

In 1640, Culpeper married Alice Field, the 15-year-old heiress of a wealthy grain merchant, which allowed him to set up a pharmacy at the halfway house in Spitalfields, London, outside the authority of the City of London, at a time when medical facilities in London were at breaking point. Arguing that &quot;no man deserved to starve to pay an insulting, insolent physician&quot; and obtaining his herbal supplies from the nearby countryside, Culpeper could provide his services free of charge. This and a willingness to examine patients in person rather than simply examining their urine (in his view, &quot;as much piss as the Thames might hold&quot; did not help in diagnosis), Culpeper was extremely active, sometimes seeing as many as 40 patients in a morning. Using a combination of experience and astrology, he devoted himself to using herbs to treat his patients.

During the early months of the English Civil War, Culpeper was accused of witchcraft and the Society of Apothecaries tried to rein in his practice. Alienated and radicalised, he joined the London Trained bands in August 1643 under the command of Philip Skippon and fought at the First Battle of Newbury, where he carried out battlefield surgery. He was taken back to London after sustaining a serious chest injury from a bullet, from which he never fully recovered. There he cooperated with the Republican astrologer William Lilly on &quot;A Prophesy of the White King&quot;, which predicted the King&#x27;s death. Culpeper died of tuberculosis in London on 10 January 1654 at the age of 37 and was buried in New Churchyard, Bethlem. Only one of his seven children, Mary, reached adulthood. He was survived by his wife, Alice, who married the astrologer John Heydon in 1656. The date of her death is uncertain: some sources say 1659, but others that she was licensed as a midwife in 1665.

==Political beliefs==
Influenced during his apprenticeship by the radical preacher John Goodwin, who said no authority was above question, Culpeper became a radical republican and opposed the &quot;closed shop&quot; of medicine enforced by censors of the College of Physicians. In his youth, Culpeper translated medical and herbal texts for his master, such as the &quot;London Pharmacopaeia&quot; from Latin. During the political turmoil of the English Civil War, the College of Physicians was unable to enforce its ban on the publication of medical texts, and Culpeper deliberately chose to publish his translations in vernacular English as self-help medical guides for use by the poor, who could not afford to consult physicians. He followed them up with a manual on childbirth and with his main work, &quot;The English Physitian&quot;, which was deliberately sold cheaply. It became available also in colonial America and has been in print continually since the 17th century.

Culpeper saw medicine as a public asset, not a commercial secret, and the prices physicians charged as too high compared with the cheap, universal availability of nature&#x27;s medicine. He felt the use of Latin and the high fees charged by doctors, lawyers and priests worked to deprive the public of power and freedom.

Culpeper was a radical in his time, angering his fellow physicians by condemning their greed, unwillingness to stray from Galen and use of harmful practices such as toxic remedies and bloodletting. The Society of Apothecaries were similarly incensed by the way he suggested cheap herbal remedies, as opposed to their expensive concoctions.

==Philosophy of herbalism==
Culpeper attempted to make medical treatments more accessible to lay persons by educating them about maintaining their health. Ultimately his ambition was to reform the system of medicine by questioning traditional methods and knowledge and exploring new solutions for ill health. The systematisation of the use of herbals by Culpeper was a key development in the evolution of modern pharmaceuticals, most of which originally had herbal origins.

Culpeper&#x27;s emphasis on reason rather than tradition is reflected in the introduction to his &quot;Complete Herbal&quot;. He was one of the best-known astrological botanists of his day, pairing the plants and diseases with planetary influences, countering illnesses with nostrums that were paired with an opposing planetary influence. Combining remedial care with Galenic humoral philosophy and questionable astrology, he forged a strangely workable system of medicine; combined with his &quot;Singles&quot; forceful commentaries, Culpeper was a widely read source for medical treatment in his time.

Though widely read his reputation was quite mixed. Eleanour Sinclair Rohde wrote of him, &quot;One cannot help suspecting that Culpeper knew perfectly well what nonsense he was talking, but that he also realised how remunerative such nonsense was and how much is customers were impressed by it.&quot; Similarly other modern writers assert that even in his own time he was regarded as, &quot;something of a fraud&quot; or a quack.

Analysis has shown that more than 90% of the botanical entries in &quot;The English Physitian&quot; were derived, if not copied outright, from apothecary John Parkinson&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Botanicum&quot; of 1640. Parkinson&#x27;s folio was massive, lavishly illustrated, and described over 3800 plants from around Europe. Culpeper&#x27;s streamlining of the content involved eschewing illustrations, narrowing the focus to only English herbs, and omitting any non-medical uses of said plants, such as in animal husbandry or domestic chores. This smaller scope allowed Culpeper&#x27;s book to be sold for a small fraction of the price, and resulted in much wider circulation. This flagrant &quot;borrowing&quot; did not escape notice at the time; one fellow apothecary published a 21-page critique including the assertion that &quot;Culpeper’s writings are either only other men’s writings which he hath translated into English or collections of other men’s works which he hath deformed&quot;.

==Legacy==
Culpeper&#x27;s translations and approach to using herbals have had an extensive impact on medicine in early North American colonies, and even modern medications. Culpeper was one of the first to translate from Latin documents discussing medicinal plants found in the Americas and colonists introduced medicinal plants from the Europe to the New World because they were featured in herbals like Culpeper&#x27;s. Culpeper described the medical use of the foxglove, the botanical precursor to digitalis, used to treat heart conditions. His influence is demonstrated by the existence of a chain of &quot;Culpeper&quot; herb and spice shops in Canada, North America and beyond, and by the continued popularity of his remedies among New Age and alternative holistic medicine practitioners.

Nicholas is featured as the title protagonist in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s story &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot;, part of his &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; anthology.

==Excerpts from &quot;The English Physitian&quot;==
Some examples of herbs, their claimed uses and preparations, as set out in &quot;The English Physitian&quot;.
*Anemone, as a juice applied externally to clean ulcerations, infections and cure leprosy; or inhaled to clear the nostrils
*Bedstraw, boiled in oil and applied externally as a stimulant, or consumed as an aphrodisiac; also applied raw externally to stimulate clotting
*Burdock, crushed and mixed with salt, as a treatment for dog bites; taken orally for flatulence, as an analgesic for tooth pain, and to strengthen the back
*Cottonweed, boiled in lye as a treatment for head lice or infestations in cloth or clothing; inhaled for headaches and coughing
*Dittany, as an abortifacient, to induce labour; as a treatment for poisoned weapons, and to draw out splinters and broken bones; the smell is said to drive away &quot;venomous beasts&quot;. (One species of dittany, &quot;Dictamnus albus&quot;, is now known to contain alkaloids, limonoid triterpenoids, flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids, coumarins, and phenylpropane)
*Fleabane, for bites from &quot;venomous beasts&quot;, and its smoke for killing gnats and fleas; but dangerous to pregnant women
*Hellebore, causes sneezing if ground and inhaled; for killing rodents if mixed with food. (Hellebore is now known to contain poisonous alkaloids: cardiac glycosides in the roots and ranunculin and protoanemonin, especially in the leaves and sap.)
*Mugwort, for inducing labour, assisting in birth and afterbirth, and easing labour pains
*Pennyroyal, for strengthening the backs of women, assisting with vertigo, and helping expel gas. (The active constituent of pennyroyal is now known to be pulegone.)
*Savory, for helping expel gas, and mixed with peas and beans for this reason
*Wood Betony, for &quot;falling sickness&quot; and headaches, anti-anoretic, &quot;helps sour belchings&quot;, cramps, convulsions, bruises, afterbirth, gout, and killing worms

==Partial list of works==
*&quot;A Physical Directory, or a Translation of the London Directory&quot; (1649) – translation of the &quot;Pharmacopoeia Londonesis&quot; of the Royal College of Physicians.
*&quot;Directory for Midwives&quot; (1651)
*&quot;Semeiotics Uranica&quot;, or (An Astrological Judgement of Diseases) (1651)
*&quot;Catastrophe Magnatum&quot; or (The Fall of Monarchy) (1652)
*&quot;The English Physitian&quot; (1652), later entitled &quot;The Complete Herbal&quot;
*&quot;Astrological Judgement of Diseases from the Decumbiture of the Sick&quot; (1655)
*&quot;A Treatise on Aurum Potabile&quot; (1656): This is certainly not by Nicholas Culpeper and lacks his style of writing. It is a confusing and repetitious work by John Heydon.

<doc id="482882" wikidata="Q255328" url="?curid=482882" title="The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert">
<text>The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert is a 1994 Australian road comedy film written and directed by Stephan Elliott. The plot follows two drag queens, played by Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce, and a transgender woman, played by Terence Stamp, as they journey across the Australian Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a tour bus that they have named &quot;Priscilla&quot;, along the way encountering various groups and individuals.

The film was a surprise worldwide hit and its positive portrayal of LGBT individuals helped to introduce LGBT themes to a mainstream audience. It received predominantly positive reviews and won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 67th Academy Awards. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and became a cult classic both in Australia and abroad.

The film was based upon the lives of three actual drag queens – Cindy Pastel, Strykermyer and Lady Bump – who were originally meant to play themselves but were later replaced with what the studio considered &quot;bankable&quot; actors. These original queens were profiled in the 1995 documentary &quot;Ladies Please&quot;.

&quot;Priscilla&quot; subsequently provided the basis for a musical, &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, which opened in 2006 in Sydney before travelling to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Broadway.

==Plot==
Anthony &quot;Tick&quot; Belrose, using the drag pseudonym of Mitzi Del Bra, is a Sydney-based drag queen who accepts an offer to perform his drag act at Lasseters Hotel Casino Resort managed by his estranged wife Marion in Alice Springs, a remote town in central Australia. After persuading his friends and fellow performers, Bernadette Bassenger, a recently bereaved transgender woman, and Adam Whitely, a flamboyant and obnoxious younger drag queen who goes under the drag name Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to join him, the three set out for a four-week run at the casino in a large tour bus, which Adam christens &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;.

While on the long journey through remote lands bordering the Simpson Desert, they meet a variety of characters, including a group of friendly Aboriginal Australians for whom they perform at a corroboree; the less accepting attitudes of rural Australia in such towns as Broken Hill; and are subjected to homophobic abuse and violence, including having their bus vandalised with homophobic graffiti.

When the bus breaks down in the middle of the desert, Adam spends the whole day repainting it lavender to cover up the vandalism. The trio later meet Bob, a middle-aged mechanic from a small outback town who joins them on their journey after his Filipina wife Cynthia leaves him. Just before they arrive at Alice Springs, Tick reveals that Marion is actually his wife, as they never divorced, and that they are going there as a favour to her.

Continuing their journey, they stop for repairs at the remote opal-mining town of Coober Pedy, where Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before Bob and Bernadette save him. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick&#x27;s marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfill a long-held dream of Adam&#x27;s, which, in the original plan, is to climb Kings Canyon in full drag regalia.

Upon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality. He is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father&#x27;s sexuality and lifestyle. While Benjamin is playing with Adam, he reveals that Marion has previously been in a lesbian relationship of her own. When their contract at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son. Bernadette decides to remain at the resort for a while with Bob, who has decided to work at the hotel after the two of them have become close.

The dummy attached to a kite that was released earlier in the film comes up again during the film&#x27;s post-credits scene, where it is revealed that it has travelled to Tibet and landed in a temple where a monk recovers it. Before the monk recovers the dummy, we can briefly see another figure sitting/praying in a background temple.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Real-life inspiration===

The film was based on the lives of three drag queens who performed as Cindy Pastel (Ritchie Finger), Strykermyer (Mark Fitzhugh) and Lady Bump (Stuart Garske). The original intention was to have them play themselves, but once the film attracted a large budget this was scrapped as it was decided &quot;bankable&quot; actors were needed. This ultimately led to the casting of three straight men with no background in drag, and as &quot;The Age&quot; wrote, &quot;the people upon whose lives the mega-hit was based were overlooked&quot;. The three original queens were profiled in a later documentary, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Ladies Please&quot;.

===Development===
The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert had originally been constructed (mainly out of frustation) by filmmakers Stephan Elliott and Stuart Quin whilst waiting for a response from Phil Collin&#x27;s agent David Wardlow about the stars participation in the film &quot;Frauds&quot;. Elliott, in an effort to distract himself, promised a new film, and good to his word, delivered a script after just 10 days, and a surprisingly wonderful script, although agreed at the time to be &quot;tricky&quot; Rebel Penfold-Russell came on as Executive Producer and the team was off. Andrena Finlay, Rebel and Stuart (The co-founders of the production company Latent Image) pitched &quot;Priscilla&quot; to various financiers at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, without success; however, before Cannes, they had taken the project to Sarah Radclyffe at Working Title, who took the film&#x27;s concept to PolyGram with Graeme Mason, who suggested Michael Hamlyn as the British co-producer and, with the backing of the Australian Film Finance Corporation, were able to begin production of the film on a relatively modest budget of 2.7 million Australian dollars.

Elliott and the film&#x27;s eventual producers, Michael Hamlyn and Al Clark, agreed to work for $50,000 each, a relatively low fee for filmmakers at the time, while the lack of funding meant that the crew agreed to receive takings of the film&#x27;s eventual profits in compensation for their low salaries. Due to the involvement of the Australian FFC, only one non-Australian actor was allowed to appear in the film, and Clark initially considered David Bowie, whom he had known back in the 1980s, and later briefly thought of John Hurt, although neither was available.

===Casting===
As noted above, the idea of casting the actual drag queens upon whom the story was based was abandoned when the producers decided to seek out &quot;bankable&quot; straight actors without a background in drag instead. In May 1993, after travelling around the Australian Outback searching for appropriate sites to film in, &quot;Priscilla&quot;″s creators attended the Cannes Film Festival and Marche to advertise their project, hoping to capitalise on the selection of Elliot&#x27;s first film &quot;Frauds&quot;, which was &quot;In Competition&quot; at the festival and despite the fact that they had not yet confirmed any actors for the roles. Their primary choice for the role of Bernadette was Tony Curtis, who read and approved of the script, but eventually became unavailable. They then approached John Cleese, who was not interested.

For the part of Tick, they had initially wanted Rupert Everett and for Adam they wanted Jason Donovan. However, at a pre-production casting meeting held at Cannes, Everett and Donovan did not get on well with one another and were found to be openly hostile toward the production staff. In light of this, it was readily agreed that they would not be suitable for the parts and the search for their three leading men would resume. However, Donovan would go on to play Tick in the West End musical adaptation of the film.

After unsuccessfully lobbying Colin Firth to play the role of Tick, producers eventually awarded the part to Hugo Weaving. Initially considering Tim Curry for the part of Bernadette, they cast Terence Stamp, who was initially anxious about the role because it was unlike anything that he had performed previously, although he eventually came on board with the concept. Stamp himself suggested Bill Hunter for the role of Bob, who accepted the role without even reading the script or being told anything about the greater concept of the film other than the basic character description, while Australian actor Guy Pearce (who had previously appeared with Donovan in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; in the late 1980s) was hired at the eleventh hour to portray the sassy but spirited Adam.

===Filming===

The Imperial Hotel in Erskineville, Sydney was the filming location for the opening and closing scenes. The Imperial Hotel has hosted drag shows since 1983, and continues to be an icon for Sydney&#x27;s LGBT community, with its restaurant renamed &#x27;Priscillas&#x27; in honour of the film. Many scenes, including one where Bernadette encounters a butch, bigoted woman named Shirley, were filmed at the outback town of Broken Hill in New South Wales, largely in a hotel named Mario&#x27;s Palace (now simply the Palace Hotel), which Al Clark believed was &quot;drag queen heaven&quot;. Some small scenes were filmed in the All Nations Hotel.

They also decided to film at Coober Pedy, a remote rough-and-tumble opal mining town in south-central Australia which featured prominently in the film. The executive producer, Rebel Penfold-Russell, appears as the marathon runner.

Initially, they tried to get permission to film upon Uluru, but this was rejected by organisations responsible for the monument, such as the Uluru Board of Management, as it would have been in violation of Indigenous Australian religious beliefs. Instead, the scene was filmed in Kings Canyon. Dialogue from the scene was rewritten slightly to accommodate the new location.

===Post-production===
With filming over, the director and producers began editing the footage, repeatedly travelling to both London and to Los Angeles, which had then just been hit by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Scenes were deleted on the advice of early viewers to shorten the film.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; took $18,459,245 at the box office in Australia, which is . It was the fifth highest-grossing Australian film in Australia of all time.

Being an Australian film, not an American-produced Hollywood blockbuster, &quot;Priscilla&quot; was released as a minor commercial product in North America and other English-speaking nations.

Director Elliott noted that the audiences viewing the film in Australia, the United States, and France all reacted to it differently, going on to state that &quot;At a screening we had for an Australian audience, they laughed at all the Aussieisms. The Americans laughed too, but at different jokes. There is a line where Tick says, &#x27;Bernadette has left her cake out in the rain...&#x27;, the Americans laughed for ten minutes.&quot; Tom O&#x27;Regan, a scholar of film studies, remarked that the film actually carried different meanings for members of different nationalities and subcultural groups, with LGBT Americans believing that the film was &quot;the big one that will bring gay lifestyles into the mainstream&quot;, while Australians tended to &quot;embrace it as just another successful Australian film&quot;.

===Critical reaction===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Priscilla&quot; has a 94% rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10; the consensus states: &quot;While its premise is ripe for comedy – and it certainly delivers its fair share of laughs – &quot;Priscilla&quot; is also a surprisingly tender and thoughtful road movie with some outstanding performances.&quot; Metacritic gives a 70 out of 100 rating, based on 20 critics.

American film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; felt that Bernadette was the key part of the film, stating that &quot;the real subject of the movie is not homosexuality, not drag queens, not showbiz, but simply the life of a middle-aged person trapped in a job that has become tiresome&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; presents a defiant culture clash in generous, warmly entertaining ways.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented &quot;In this roaringly comic and powerfully affecting road movie, Terence Stamp gives one of the year&#x27;s best performances.&quot; Kenneth Turan from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;The comic pizazz and bawdy dazzle of this film&#x27;s vision of gaudy drag performers trekking across the Australian outback certainly has a boisterous, addictive way about it.&quot;

===Cultural impact and legacy===

&quot;Priscilla&quot;, along with other contemporary Australian films &quot;Young Einstein&quot; (1988), &quot;Sweetie&quot; (1989), &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992), and &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), provided Australian cinema with a reputation for &quot;quirkiness&quot;, &quot;eccentricity&quot; and &quot;individuality&quot; across the world. Both &quot;Priscilla&quot; and &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (which had also featured a soundtrack containing ABBA songs) in particular became cult classics, not only in their native Australia, but also in the United Kingdom, where a wave of Australian influences, such as the soap operas &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home &amp; Away&quot;, had made their mark in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1995, an American film, &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;, was released, featuring three drag queens who travel across the United States. According to Al Clark, the creators of &quot;Priscilla&quot; heard about the film while shooting theirs, and &quot;for a moment [were] troubled&quot; until they read the script of &quot;To Wong Foo&quot;, when they decided that it was sufficiently different from &quot;Priscilla&quot; to not be a commercial and critical threat. &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; had a mixed critical response in comparison to &quot;Priscilla&quot;, but was a box office success in North America as it was a film from a major Hollywood studio and starred big-name actors. Like &quot;Priscilla&quot;, &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; has also enjoyed a cult following.

During the 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, &quot;Priscilla&quot; was part of a parade of images of Australian popular culture. A 1980 Denning (resembling the bus used in the film) featuring a giant steel stiletto heel which extended from and retracted into the roof – inspired by scenes from the film – paraded around the Olympic Stadium. The bus was accompanied by several stiletto heel tricycle floats and drag queens in big wigs in tribute to the film&#x27;s international success and the local Sydney gay community. The music video for Iggy Azalea&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Work&quot; paid homage to scenes from the film.

The bus used in the film, which was a 1976 Hino Freighter from Japan, was rediscovered in 2019 at a property in Ewingar, New South Wales. A campaign was launched by the History Trust of South Australia, with the help of the Government of South Australia to restore the bus for eventual display in the National Motor Museum, Birdwood. Restoration works on the vehicle are taking place in Brisbane.

===Racism and sexism controversy===
The film has come under criticism for alleged racist and sexist elements, particularly in the portrayal of the Filipina character, Cynthia. Melba Marginson of the Centre for Filipino Concerns stated that Cynthia was portrayed as &quot;a gold-digger, a prostitute, an entertainer whose expertise is popping out ping-pong balls from her sex-organ, a manic depressive, loud and vulgar. The worst stereotype of the Filipina.&quot; She argued that, by portraying Cynthia in this manner, the filmmakers were &quot;violently kill[ing]&quot; the dignity of Filipina women, something that she feared would lead to &quot;more violence against us.&quot; An editor writing in &quot;The Age&quot; echoed these concerns, highlighting that &quot;It is perhaps a pity that a film with a message of tolerance and acceptance for homosexuals should feel the need of what looks very much to us like a racist and sexist stereotype.&quot; Similarly, in his study of bisexuality in cinema, Wayne M. Bryant argued that while it was &quot;an excellent film&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla&quot; was marred by &quot;instances of gratuitous sexism.&quot;

Producer Clark defended the film against these accusations, arguing that while Cynthia was a stereotype, it was not the purpose of filmmakers to avoid the portrayal of &quot;vulnerable characters&quot; from specific minority backgrounds. He stated that she was &quot;a misfit like the three protagonists are, and just about everybody else in the film is, and her presence is no more a statement about Filipino women than having three drag queens is a statement about Australian men.&quot; Tom O&#x27;Regan noted that as a result of this controversy, the film gained &quot;an ambiguous reputation.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The film featured a soundtrack made up of pre-existing &quot;camp classics&quot; (pop music songs that have a particular fanbase in the LGBT community). The original plan by the film&#x27;s creators was to have a Kylie Minogue song in the finale, although it was later decided that an ABBA song would be more appropriate because its &quot;tacky qualities&quot; were &quot;more timeless&quot; (although in the musical adaptation, the character Adam performs a medley of Kylie Minogue songs atop Uluru). The film itself featured four main songs, which were performed by two or more of the drag queens as a part of their show within the film; &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been to Me&quot; by Charlene, &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor, &quot;Finally&quot; by CeCe Peniston, and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; by ABBA. On 23 August 1994, Fontana Island released the soundtrack on CD.

Original music for the soundtrack was composed by Guy Gross, with choral and instrumental arrangements by Derek Williams, and released separately on CD.

<doc id="482903" wikidata="Q1505987" url="?curid=482903" title="Western Design Center">
<text>The Western Design Center (WDC), located in Mesa, Arizona, is a company which develops intellectual property for, and licenses manufacture of, MOS Technology 65xx based microprocessors, microcontrollers (µCs), and related support devices. WDC was founded in 1978 by a former MOS Technology employee and co-holder of the MOS Technology 6502 patent, Bill Mensch. Prior to leaving MOS Technology in 1977 Bill was the microprocessor design manager at MOS Technology.

Beyond discrete devices, WDC offers device designs in the form of semiconductor intellectual property cores (IP cores) to use inside other chips such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), and provides ASIC and embedded systems consulting services revolving around their processor designs. WDC also produces C compilers, assembler/linker packages, simulators, development–evaluation printed circuit boards, and in-circuit emulators for their processors.

==Hardware products==
The first product developed by WDC was the WDC 65C02, a CMOS version of the NMOS based MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. The 65C02 reduced the power consumption, improved noise immunity and added some new instructions. The 65C02 was subsequently adopted for use in the Apple IIc computer and, later, in an enhanced version of the Apple IIe.

Mensch&#x27;s next design, which was to become an important product at WDC, was a 65C02-compatible 16-bit microprocessor, the 65C816, later designated W65C816S. The 65C816&#x27;s design came about following consultation with Apple and was adopted by them for use in the Apple IIGS computer. The 65C816 was later chosen as the core of the Ricoh 5A22 processor that powered the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

===Devices===
===Personal computer===
The Mensch Computer is a W65C265 and W65C22-based hobbyist experimental personal computer named after company founder Bill Mensch.

<text>Belarusian State University (BSU) (, ; ) is a university in Minsk, Belarus. It was founded on October 30, 1921. In 2023 the university was ranked the number 387 university in the world in the QS World University Rankings.

==History==
===1919-49; early years===
On February 25, 1919, the Central Executive Committee of the Belorussian SSR resolved to establish the first national university in Belarus. However, the occupation of Minsk by the Polish army delayed these plans, and the university&#x27;s opening was set back to October 30, 1921.

Initially, the university comprised three faculties (Workers, Medicine, and Humanities) that enrolled a total of 1,390 students. The faculty included 14 professors, 49 lecturers and 10 teaching assistants, most of whom were transferred from the universities of Moscow, Kazan and Kiev. In 1922, the Pedagogical Faculty was established. The first class that counted 34 economists and 26 lawyers graduated in 1925. By 1930, the university consisted of six faculties: Workers, Medicine, Pedagogical, National Economy, Law and Soviet Development, Chemical Technology.

In 1941 the university consisted of six Faculties: Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, Biology, History, Geography, and Languages. There was also a Workers Faculty that provided part-time education to full-time employees of factories and plants, as well as special part-time Polish- and Yiddish-language sections. After Minsk was occupied by Nazi Germany in June 1941, some students and academic staff were evacuated to the east. In May 1943, Belarusian State University was re-opened in the town of Skhodnya, 12 km northwest of Moscow. The university relocated back to Minsk in the summer of 1944 and classes resumed. In 1949, the university was named after Vladimir Lenin to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Byelorussian SSR.

===1950-2007===
In 1975 the Faculty of Radiophysics and Electronics was split off from the Faculty of Physics, and in 1989 the Faculty of Philosophy and Economics was established. The research institutes for physico-chemical problems and nuclear problems were opened in 1978 and 1986, respectively.

After Belarus gained independence from the USSR in 1991, new faculties and institutes were created: the Faculty of International Relations (1995), the State Institute of Management and Social Technologies (2003), the Military Faculty (2003), the St. Methodius and Cyril Theological Institute (2004), the Humanities Faculty (2004); the Institute of Business and Technology Management (2006), the Confucius Institute for Sinology (2007).

Rector Alyaksandr Kazulin was fired in 2003 on accusations of corruption.

===2008-present; criticism and political controversies===
In 2008, the activist Franak Viačorka, a member of Partyja BPF, was expelled from the Journalism Faculty of the Belarusian State University and forced into military service. In the same year, Michaił Paškievič, a member of the United Civic Party and leader of the party&#x27;s youth wing, was expelled from the BSU History Faculty for political activity.

In 2009, the BSU Law Faculty expelled the student Tatsiana Shaputska, a member of the Malady Front, after her participation in the Civil Society Forum of the Eastern Partnership in Brussels.

As part of the international sanctions against the regime in Belarus following a crackdown of the opposition following the 2010 Belarusian presidential election, Siarhiej Abłamiejka, at that time rector of the Belarusian State University, was banned from entering the European Union. In its decision, the EU Council accused him of being &quot;responsible for the expulsion of several students from the University because they participated in the demonstrations on 19 December 2010 and in other peaceful demonstrations in 2011.&quot; It was reported that students were expelled from the Belarusian State University for participating in the protests in 2010 and 2011.

According to reports by human rights organizations, politically motivated expulsions from the Belarusian State University continued also after the EU lifted most of its sanctions against Belarus in 2014.

According to reports by media and human rights organizations, many students of the Belarusian State University are being forced to vote early at elections and referendums, which is considered an essential part of centralized electoral fraud in Belarus. No election or referendum in Belarus has been recognized by the United States, the European Union, or the OSCE as free and fair since the mid-1990s.

In 2020–21, several university teachers were fired for political reasons. A number of students who participated in the protests or openly expressed their civil position were expelled. Professor Svetlana Volchek was arrested for writing to the university leadership expressing concern about police violence during the protests, and found guilty of spreading information about a planned protest.

In 2021, four previously expelled BSU students were sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for protesting in the university and &quot;disruption of the educational process&quot;. All of them were recognized as political prisoners. Several BSU employees were witnesses.

Aliaksandr Danilevich, a university professor and a member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, was arrested by Belarusian police on May 20, 2022. In February 2022 he had signed a petition calling for an end to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. After he signed the petition the university told him they would not extend his contract; the day before his arrest he had asked for a written explanation to why his contract was ended.

==Ranking==
In 2023 the university was ranked the number 387 university in the world in the QS World University Rankings.

==Campus==

<doc id="482912" wikidata="Q863789" url="?curid=482912" title="Bingham plastic">
<text>In materials science, a Bingham plastic is a viscoplastic material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high stress. It is named after Eugene C. Bingham who proposed its mathematical form.

It is used as a common mathematical model of mud flow in drilling engineering, and in the handling of slurries. A common example is toothpaste, which will not be extruded until a certain pressure is applied to the tube. It is then pushed out as a relatively coherent plug.

==Explanation==
Figure 1 shows a graph of the behaviour of an ordinary viscous (or Newtonian) fluid in red, for example in a pipe. If the pressure at one end of a pipe is increased this produces a stress on the fluid tending to make it move (called the shear stress) and the volumetric flow rate increases proportionally. However, for a Bingham Plastic fluid (in blue), stress can be applied but it will not flow until a certain value, the yield stress, is reached. Beyond this point the flow rate increases steadily with increasing shear stress. This is roughly the way in which Bingham presented his observation, in an experimental study of paints. These properties allow a Bingham plastic to have a textured surface with peaks and ridges instead of a featureless surface like a Newtonian fluid.

Figure 2 shows the way in which it is normally presented currently. The graph shows shear stress on the vertical axis and shear rate on the horizontal one. (Volumetric flow rate depends on the size of the pipe, shear rate is a measure of how the velocity changes with distance. It is proportional to flow rate, but does not depend on pipe size.) As before, the Newtonian fluid flows and gives a shear rate for any finite value of shear stress. However, the Bingham plastic again does not exhibit any shear rate (no flow and thus no velocity) until a certain stress is achieved. For the Newtonian fluid the slope of this line is the viscosity, which is the only parameter needed to describe its flow. By contrast, the Bingham plastic requires two parameters, the yield stress and the slope of the line, known as the plastic viscosity.

The physical reason for this behaviour is that the liquid contains particles (such as clay) or large molecules (such as polymers) which have some kind of interaction, creating a weak solid structure, formerly known as a false body, and a certain amount of stress is required to break this structure. Once the structure has been broken, the particles move with the liquid under viscous forces. If the stress is removed, the particles associate again.

==Definition==
The material is an elastic solid for shear stress formula_1, less than a critical value formula_2. Once the critical shear stress (or &quot;yield stress&quot;) is exceeded, the material flows in such a way that the shear rate, ∂&quot;u&quot;/∂&quot;y&quot; (as defined in the article on viscosity), is directly proportional to the amount by which the applied shear stress exceeds the yield stress:

:formula_3

==Friction factor formulae==
In fluid flow, it is a common problem to calculate the pressure drop in an established piping network. Once the friction factor, &quot;f&quot;, is known, it becomes easier to handle different pipe-flow problems, viz. calculating the pressure drop for evaluating pumping costs or to find the flow-rate in a piping network for a given pressure drop. It is usually extremely difficult to arrive at exact analytical solution to calculate the friction factor associated with flow of non-Newtonian fluids and therefore explicit approximations are used to calculate it. Once the friction factor has been calculated the pressure drop can be easily determined for a given flow by the Darcy–Weisbach equation:

:formula_4

where:
* formula_5 is the Darcy friction factor (SI units: dimensionless)
* formula_6 is the frictional head loss (SI units: m)
* formula_7 is the gravitational acceleration (SI units: m/s²)
* formula_8 is the pipe diameter (SI units: m)
* formula_9 is the pipe length (SI units: m)
* formula_10 is the mean fluid velocity (SI units: m/s)

===Laminar flow===
An exact description of friction loss for Bingham plastics in fully developed laminar pipe flow was first published by Buckingham. His expression, the &quot;Buckingham–Reiner&quot; equation, can be written in a dimensionless form as follows:

:formula_11

where:
* formula_12 is the laminar flow Darcy friction factor (SI units: dimensionless)
* formula_13 is the Reynolds number (SI units: dimensionless)
* formula_14 is the Hedstrom number (SI units: dimensionless)

The Reynolds number and the Hedstrom number are respectively defined as:
:formula_15 and
:formula_16

where:
* formula_17 is the mass density of fluid (SI units: kg/m3)
* formula_18 is the dynamic viscosity of fluid (SI units: kg/m s)
* formula_19 is the yield point (yield strength) of fluid (SI units: Pa)

===Turbulent flow===
Darby and Melson developed an empirical expression
that was then refined, and is given by:

:formula_20

where:

* formula_21 is the turbulent flow friction factor (SI units: dimensionless)
* formula_22
Note: Darby and Melson&#x27;s expression is for a Fanning friction factor, and needs to be multiplied by 4 to be used in the friction loss equations located elsewhere on this page.

==Approximations of the Buckingham–Reiner equation==
Although an exact analytical solution of the Buckingham–Reiner equation can be obtained because it is a fourth order polynomial equation in &quot;f&quot;, due to complexity of the solution it is rarely employed. Therefore, researchers have tried to develop explicit approximations for the Buckingham–Reiner equation.

===Swamee–Aggarwal equation===
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor &quot;f&quot; for laminar flow of Bingham plastic fluids. It is an approximation of the implicit &quot;Buckingham–Reiner&quot; equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data.
The Swamee–Aggarwal equation is given by:

:formula_23

===Danish–Kumar solution===
Danish &quot;et al.&quot; have provided an explicit procedure to calculate the friction factor &quot;f&quot; by using the Adomian decomposition method. The friction factor containing two terms through this method is given as:

:formula_24

where

:formula_25

and

:formula_26

==Combined equation for friction factor for all flow regimes==

===Darby–Melson equation===
In 1981, Darby and Melson, using the approach of Churchill and of Churchill and Usagi, developed an expression to get a single friction factor equation valid for all flow regimes:

:formula_27

where:
:formula_28

Both Swamee–Aggarwal equation and the Darby–Melson equation can be combined to give an explicit equation for determining the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids in any regime. Relative roughness is not a parameter in any of the equations because the friction factor of Bingham plastic fluids is not sensitive to pipe roughness.

Whitaker was born in Rostrevor, a small town in the south of County Down, to Roman Catholic parents on 8 December 1916, and was reared in Drogheda, County Louth, in modest circumstances. Neither of his parents were from Ulster. His mother, Jane O&#x27;Connor, came from Ballyguirey East, Labasheeda, County Clare. His father, Edward Whitaker, hailed from County Westmeath and was assistant manager of a linen mill. He received his primary and secondary education at the local CBS in Drogheda. He studied mathematics, Celtic studies and Latin by correspondence course at University of London, and was awarded external degrees in economics: a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1941 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1952.

==Career==
In 1956, Whitaker was appointed Secretary of the Department of Finance, at the age of thirty-nine. His appointment took place at a time when Ireland&#x27;s economy was in deep depression. Economic growth was non-existent, inflation apparently insoluble, unemployment rife, living standards low and emigration at a figure not far below the birth rate. Whitaker believed that free trade, with increased competition and the end of protectionism, would become inevitable and that jobs would have to be created by a shift from agriculture to industry and services. He formed a team of officials within the department which produced a detailed study of the economy, culminating in a plan recommending policies for improvement. The plan was accepted by the government and was transformed into a White Paper which became known as the &quot;First Programme for Economic Expansion&quot;, and quite unusually this was published with his name attached in November 1958. The programme which became known as the &quot;Grey Book&quot; who many argue brought the stimulus of foreign investment into the Irish economy. However other reforms such as the Department of Industry and Commerce&#x27;s export profits tax relief introduced in 1956, were opposed by Whitaker.

Before devoting himself to poetry, Thomas Kinsella was Whitaker&#x27;s private secretary. TK Whitaker opposed the low tax strategy.

In 1977, Taoiseach Jack Lynch nominated Whitaker as a member of the 14th Seanad. He served as a Senator from 1977 to 1981, where he sat as an independent member.

In 1981, he was nominated to the 15th Seanad by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, where he served until 1982. FitzGerald also appointed him to chair a Committee of Inquiry into the Irish penal system, and he chaired a Parole Board or Sentence Review Group for several years.

Whitaker also served as Chancellor of the National University of Ireland from 1976 to 1996. He was also President of the Royal Irish Academy and as such, a member of the Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland, from 1985 to 1987. He had had a very strong love for the Irish language throughout his career and the collection of Irish poetry, &quot;An Duanaire: Poems of the Dispossessed 1600–1900&quot;, edited by Seán Ó Tuama and Thomas Kinsella was dedicated to Whitaker. From 1995 to 1996 he chaired the Constitution Review Group, an independent expert group established by the government, which published its report in July 1996.

==Awards and recognition==
Whitaker received many national and international honours and tributes for his achievements during his lifetime, most notably the conferral of &quot;Irishman of the 20th Century&quot; in 2001 and Greatest Living Irish Person in 2002. In November 2014, the Institute of Banking conferred an Honorary Fellowship on Whitaker and created an annual T.K. Whitaker Scholarship in his name. In April 2015, he was presented with a lifetime achievement award by University College Dublin&#x27;s Economics Society for his outstanding contribution to Ireland&#x27;s economic policy.

In November 2016, to mark his centenary year, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council acknowledged Whitaker&#x27;s &quot;outstanding and progressive contribution to Irish public service and to society&quot;. The Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Cormac Devlin, presented a special award to Whitaker which was accepted by Ken Whitaker on behalf of his father.

==Whitaker Square==
Whitaker Square in the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin 2 is named in his honour. The offices of the Economic and Social Research Institute are located on the square.

==Personal life==
Whitaker married Nora Fogarty in 1941; they had six children. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1994, he remarried, to Mary Moore in 2005. The couple were invited to Áras an Uachtaráin in 2006 for his 90th birthday by the President of Ireland. Mary Moore Whitaker died in 2008. T.K. Whitaker turned 100 in December 2016 and died a month later on 9 January 2017, having survived both of his wives.

Whitaker and his family spoke Irish at home. The family spent a good deal of time in the North Mayo Gaeltacht after buying and renovating a former schoolhouse in Glencullen Lower, near Bangor Erris, in 1972. Whitaker was also a keen salmon angler in the nearby Carrowmore Lake and Owenmore.

<text>The Alberta New Democratic Party (Alberta NDP; ), is social democratic political party in Alberta, Canada. The party sits on the centre-left to left-wing of the political spectrum and is a provincial Alberta affiliate of the federal New Democratic Party.

The successor to the Alberta section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the even earlier Alberta wing of the Canadian Labour Party and the United Farmers of Alberta. From the mid-1980s to 2004, the party abbreviated its name as the &quot;New Democrats&quot; (ND).

The party served as Official Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1982 to 1993. It was shut out of the legislature following the 1993 election, returning in the 1997 election with two seats. The party won no more than four seats in subsequent elections until the 2015 election, in which it won 54 of the 87 seats in the legislature and formed a majority government. Until 2015, Alberta had been the only province in western Canada—the party&#x27;s birthplace—where the NDP had never governed at the provincial level. The Alberta NDP was defeated after a single term in the 2019 election by the United Conservative Party—the first time that a governing party in Alberta had been unseated after a single term.

==History==

=== Origins and early years (1932–1962) ===

The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was founded in Calgary on 1 August 1932. However, it faced challenges in Alberta due to lack of support from the governing United Farmers of Alberta party and the Labour Party. While some UFA Members of Parliament supported the CCF and ran unsuccessfully as CCF candidates in the 1935 federal election, most UFA leaders and members were ambivalent. The CCF did not run candidates in the 1935 provincial election due to its ties with the UFA and Labour Party. The UFA lost all its seats in the election, and CCF candidates associated with the UFA were defeated due to the unpopularity of the UFA government and the rising popularity of William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit movement.

In 1936, William Irvine, a CCF founder and defeated UFA Member of Parliament, was elected the Alberta CCF&#x27;s first president. In 1937, the UFA decided to leave electoral politics entirely and, in 1938, the CCF committed itself to run candidates in the next provincial and elections setting up local riding clubs for that purpose. In 1939, former UFA/CCF MLA Chester Ronning became the Alberta CCF&#x27;s first leader in the 1940 provincial election but despite winning 11% of the vote the party did not win any seats in the Alberta Legislature - the CCF had not garnered the support of the UFA&#x27;s conservative supporters or put a dent in support for the agrarian populism of the Social Credit Party of Alberta.

The Alberta wing of the Labour Party federated with the CCF in 1935, but ran its own candidates in the 1935 and 1940 provincial elections. In 1942, the Alberta CCF clubs formally merged with the Labour Party and Elmer Roper became the new leader after achieving an unexpected victory in a 1942 by-election, becoming the party&#x27;s first Alberta MLA (excepting Chester Ronning, who had been elected in 1932 as a joint UFA/CCF candidate). In the next two years party membership soared from 2,500 to over 12,000.

In the 1944 election, the CCF received 24% of the vote but won only 2 seats, both of them in Edmonton and Calgary where the use of single transferable vote ensured fair representation. (The disproportionality was due to the way boundaries of the constituencies outside the cities were drawn and the use of Instant-runoff voting outside the cities, which did not help a lesser party like the CCF.) The Social Credit government received more than half of ballots cast. Roper was joined in the legislature by Aylmer Liesemer, a Calgary schoolteacher. The rise of support for the CCF after 1942 mobilized the business community to pull out of efforts to build an anti-Social Credit party and instead back the Social Credit government, now led by Ernest Manning, after William Aberhart&#x27;s death in 1943, as a bulwark against socialists. Unlike the Saskatchewan CCF, which won office in the 1944 Saskatchewan election on a platform calling for social programs, the Alberta CCF was more radical and campaigned on provincial ownership of the province&#x27;s resources and utilities. Irvine also advocated an alliance with the communist Labor-Progressive Party which would have been beneficial in the cities where the single transferable vote electoral system was used.

Through the 1940s and 1950s, the CCF&#x27;s vote percentage declined, eventually falling under 10 percent. At any one time, the party never won more than two seats. The party was kept to two MLAs throughout the 1950s. Roper lost his seat in the 1955 election. In the same election, Stanley Ruzycki and Nick Dushenski were elected. Roper was succeeded as party leader by Floyd Albin Johnson. The 1959 general election was a disaster for the CCF, losing both its existing seats. Party leader Johnson, running in the Dunvegan electoral district, failed to win his seat, leaving the party shut out of the legislature.

=== Alberta NDP in opposition (1962–2015) ===

The CCF merged with the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961, becoming the New Democratic Party of Canada. In Alberta, the NDP was founded in 1962 with a new leader, Neil Reimer, Canadian director of the Oil Workers International Union. The NDP did not, at first, build much on the CCF&#x27;s popularity, and, with the exception of a 1966 by-election victory by Garth Turcott, did not win any seats until the 1971 election when Grant Notley, who had taken over the party in 1968, was elected to the legislature.

With the cancellation of single transferable voting in Edmonton in 1956, the NDP did not win a seat in Edmonton until 1982. (This is in strong contrast to the steady winning of one seat in Edmonton in each election, from the 1926 introduction of STV in Edmonton to 1952. The pattern in Calgary is similar. Although not successful in getting a seat in that city every election under STV, it was not until 1986 that a CCF or NDP MLA was elected in Calgary, following STV&#x27;s cessation in 1956.)

==== Rise to Official Opposition ====
The election of the Progressive Conservatives in 1971 led to the gradual collapse of Social Credit. The Alberta Liberal Party suffered in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to its association with the unpopular federal Liberal Party government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

The decline of Social Credit and the unpopularity of the Liberals allowed the New Democrats to become the main opposition to the Lougheed-led Conservatives. Under Grant Notley’s leadership from 1968 to 1984, the NDP&#x27;s popularity gradually increased. It grew from 10% in the 1971 election to 19% in the 1982 election. Despite winning only two seats, the party became the Official Opposition in 1982.

In the 1986 election, under Ray Martin&#x27;s leadership, the party won 30% of the vote and 16 seats, marking a high point for New Democrat support. Party membership increased from around 5,000 in the 1970s to 20,000 after the 1986 provincial election. However, the New Democrats were unable to gain additional seats in the 1989 election. While they remained the Official Opposition in the legislature, their popular support fell behind the Liberals for the first time in decades, with the Liberals at 28% and the NDs at 26%.

==== Wipeout and recovery ====
In the 1993 election, their popular vote fell by more than half to 11%, and they were shut out of the legislature altogether. This was mainly due to the anti-PC vote consolidating around the Liberals. Both the Liberals and Tories were preaching the need for fiscal conservatism at the time. Ray Martin resigned as leader and was succeeded first by Ross Harvey and then by Pam Barrett. The party regained its presence in the legislature by winning two seats in the 1997 election. Barrett resigned her position as party leader in 2000 after claiming a near-death experience in a dentist&#x27;s chair. She was succeeded by Raj Pannu. The party retained its two seats in the 2001 election.

In 2004, the party reverted to the traditional &quot;NDP&quot; abbreviation and the colour orange. That same year Raj Panu resigned as leader and was replaced by Brian Mason. In the 2004 Alberta general election the party doubled its seats from two to four—which re-elected then leader Brian Mason and Raj Pannu, returning former leader Ray Martin, and newcomer David Eggen. The party received 10% of the vote province-wide.

In the 2008 election, the party was reduced to two seats. Brian Mason was re-elected as was newcomer Rachel Notley. Ray Martin and David Eggen were narrowly defeated. The party received 8.5% of the popular vote.

==== Attempts at political cooperation ====

At its 2008 provincial convention, the party overwhelmingly rejected a proposal by the Environment Caucus recommending a party task force be mandated to &quot;investigate a variety of options for political cooperation with the Alberta Liberals and/or Greens.&quot; and &quot;to prepare a motion to be considered&quot; at the next Party Convention.
The proposal was opposed by NDP leader Brian Mason.

Alberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan independently distributed a proposal for a cooperation pact with the Alberta Liberal Party and Alberta Greens to defeat Progressive Conservative candidates. The proposal, titled &quot;The Way Forward: An AFL proposal for a united alternative to the Conservatives,&quot; suggested that the parties not compete against each other in certain ridings. Although McGowan was unable to speak on the issue before the resolution was defeated, he later addressed it during his report to the Convention as AFL President. He urged members to acknowledge the need for significant change in light of 40 years of Tory government and the recent election results.

==== Growing momentum ====
In the 2012 provincial election the NDP picked up two seats in Edmonton, regaining their previous 4 seat total. Both Rachel Notley and Brian Mason safely held onto their seats while David Eggen was re-elected as the member for Edmonton-Calder. Newcomer Deron Bilous was also elected in Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview, the seat formerly held by Martin. In many other ridings the party also won more votes than it had attained previously.

On April 29, 2014, Brian Mason announced that he would step down as leader as soon as a leadership election could be held to choose his successor. The leadership convention was held in Edmonton from October 18 to October 19, 2014. Rachel Notley was elected as the party&#x27;s next leader, defeating fellow MLA David Eggen and union leader Rod Loyola in the first ballot with 70% of the vote.

===First government (2015–2019)===


The incumbent PC premier Jim Prentice called an election on April 7, 2015, following the reveal of a new budget to strengthen his party&#x27;s mandate. On election night, the NDP won 54 seats, re-electing all four of their incumbents as well as 50 new members to the legislative assembly. The NDP had high expectations for Edmonton, given Notley&#x27;s local ties and the city&#x27;s historically favourable stance towards centre-left parties. Surpassing all projections, the party won every seat in the capital and also swept Red Deer and Lethbridge. They also secured 15 seats in Calgary, the long-standing stronghold of the Tories, and gained 16 more seats across the rest of Alberta, mostly in the northern and central regions.

The Notley Government was characterized by a small cabinet and an intense focus on the economy. At the time of the early election call Alberta was sinking into a deep recession caused by the collapse of world oil prices. As a result of the province&#x27;s dependence on oil royalties over more traditional revenue sources, Alberta&#x27;s deficit soared. After reversing prior budget cuts, Notley mostly shied away from major wealth redistribution and preferred to stimulate the economy through infrastructure spending and maintaining public services. Most new programs, such as school lunches, were introduced cautiously through pilot programs. Despite ostensibly being a party of labour, the NDP froze wages and generally took the side of management in labour disputes, and a higher minimum wage was phased in relatively slowly. Labour code changes were generally incremental, though an update to labour standards on farms was extremely divisive in rural Alberta. However, Notley moved forwards with a carbon pricing scheme and plans for sustainability and energy transitions early in her term. Controversially such plans were framed around creating a social license for pursuing oil sand expansion, and she championed the creation of pipelines and partnered heavily with the oil industry. As a result plans to raise oil royalties were scrapped, and tax increases on corporations and higher income brackets were modest. Eventually this led to a schism between the NDP governments of Alberta and British Columbia over the twinning of the Transmountain Pipeline, which remained a contentious project in the Canadian political arena and particularly within the federal New Democratic Party. While the Alberta economy recovered from the depths of the energy recession by 2019, the oil industry remained relatively stagnant and economic growth had been nowhere near what Alberta had enjoyed in the previous decade.

===Return to Opposition (2019–present)===

The NDP was dealt a severe blow when the PCs and Wildrose merged to form the United Conservative Party, which immediately ascended to a large lead in opinion polling.

In the 2019 election, the NDP suffered a significant defeat to the UCP. Despite receiving more votes compared to the previous election, the NDP lost a majority of their seats, ending with only 24 seats. The party performed well in Edmonton but struggled in the rest of the province, winning only a few seats in Calgary, the Edmonton suburbs, and Lethbridge. This was the first time in Alberta&#x27;s history that an incumbent government has been defeated after one term. Rachel Notley remained popular within the NDP and continued as the Leader of the Opposition, leading the largest opposition caucus in Alberta since 1993.

In the 2023 election, the NDP received a record high popular vote for the party with 44%, dominating Edmonton and gaining a significant portion of the vote in Calgary. However, their success was largely limited to urban areas as they only won one rural seat Banff-Kananaskis. With 38 MLAs, the party elected the largest official opposition in Alberta history.

On January 16, 2024, Notley announced she would be resigning as party leader effective the next leadership election, scheduled for June 22, 2024. Former Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi emerged victorious, winning with 86% of the vote, the largest for any winner of a provincial leadership election of any major political party in Canada.

<doc id="482915" wikidata="Q833376" url="?curid=482915" title="Distinguished Service Cross (United States)">
<text>The Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) is the United States Army&#x27;s second highest military decoration for soldiers who display extraordinary heroism in combat with an armed enemy force. Actions that merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be of such a high degree that they are above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations, but which do not meet the criteria for the Medal of Honor. The Army Distinguished Service Cross is equivalent to the Naval Services&#x27; Navy Cross, the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Air Force Cross, and the Coast Guard Cross. Prior to the creation of the Air Force Cross in 1960, airmen were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

The Distinguished Service Cross was first awarded during World War I. In addition, a number of awards were bestowed for actions which took place before World War I. In many cases, the medal was awarded to soldiers who had received a Certificate of Merit for gallantry; at the time, this certificate was the only other honor for gallantry the Army could present to combatants in lieu of a Medal of Honor. Others were furnished in belated recognition of actions which occurred in the Philippine–American War, during the Boxer Rebellion, and Pancho Villa Expedition.

The Distinguished Service Cross is distinct from the Distinguished Service Medal, which is awarded to Army soldiers in recognition of exceptionally meritorious service to the government of the United States in a duty of great responsibility. The Distinguished Service Cross is only awarded for actions in combat, while the Distinguished Service Medal has no such restriction.

==Description==
A cross of bronze, high and wide with an eagle on the center and a scroll below the eagle bearing the inscription &quot;&quot;. On the reverse side, the center of the cross is circled by a wreath with a space for engraving the name of the recipient.

==Service ribbon==
The service ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes:
* Old Glory Red 67156;
* White 67101;
* Imperial Blue 67175;
* White;
* Old Glory Red.

==Criteria==
The Distinguished Service Cross is awarded to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army (or in the Air Force, before 1960), distinguishes themselves by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a Medal of Honor; while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States; while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing/foreign force; or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The act or acts of heroism must have been so notable and have involved risk of life so extraordinary as to set the individual apart from their comrades.

==Components==
The following are authorized components of the Distinguished Service Cross:
# Decoration (regular size): MIL-D-3943/4. NSN 8455-00-269-5745 for decoration set. NSN 8455-00-246-3827 for individual replacement medal.
# Decoration (miniature size): MIL-D-3943/4. NSN 8455-00-996-50007.
# Ribbon: MIL-R-11589/50. NSN 8455-00-252-9919.
# Lapel Button (a colored enameled replica of service ribbon): MIL-L-11484/1. NSN 8455-00-253-0808.

Additional awards of the Army Distinguished Service Cross are denoted with oak leaf clusters.

==Background==
The Distinguished Service Cross was established by President Woodrow Wilson on January 2, 1918. General John J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the expeditionary forces in France, had recommended that recognition other than the Medal of Honor be authorized for the United States Army for valorous service rendered in like manner to that awarded by the European armies. The request for the establishment of the medal was forwarded from the secretary of war to the president in a letter dated December 28, 1917. The act of Congress establishing this award (193-65th Congress), dated July 9, 1918, is contained in . The establishment of the Distinguished Service Cross was promulgated in War Department General Order No. 6, dated January 12, 1918.

The first style of the Distinguished Service Cross was designed by Captain Aymar E. Embury II, Engineers Officer Reserve Corps, and World War I artist Lieutenant J. Andre Smith. The first medals were struck by the United States Mint from a sculpture by Gaetano Cecere, who went on to design the Soldier&#x27;s Medal. It was decided that minor changes were needed to make the medal more attractive. In light of the urgency in supplying the decorations to General Pershing, the first one hundred medals were struck from the original design. They were sent on the understanding that replacements in the second design (also numbered from 1 to 100) would be provided once they were available. Embury made the modifications with the plaster model for the second (and current) version made by John R. Sinnock, who also sculpted various other medals, including the Purple Heart.

Army Regulation (AR) 670–1, governing the wear and appearance of army uniforms and insignia, and its associated guide specify that the Distinguished Service Cross appears second in the order of precedence of U.S. military decorations, preceded only by the Medal of Honor. Policy for awards, approving authority, supply, and issue of decorations is contained in AR 600-8-22. provides for a 10% increase in retired pay for enlisted personnel who have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and retired with more than 20 years of service.

==Awarding history==
===World War I===
During World War I, 6,309 awards of the Distinguished Service Cross were made to 6,185 recipients. Several dozen Army soldiers, as well as eight marines and two French Army officers, received two Distinguished Service Crosses. The first awards were made on March 18, 1918, to 3 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division.

A handful, mostly United States Army Air Service aviators, were decorated three or more times. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, the top U.S. ace of the war, was awarded a record eight Distinguished Service Crosses, one of which was later upgraded to the Medal of Honor, while flying with the 94th Aero Squadron. Fellow aviators Captain Douglas Campbell, also of the 94th, and First Lieutenant Frank O&#x27;Driscoll &quot;Monk&quot; Hunter of the 103rd Aero Squadron each received five. Another 94th aviator, Major Reed McKinley Chambers, was awarded four Distinguished Service Crosses. Three aviators received three Distinguished Service Crosses First Lieutenant Murray K. Guthrie of the 13th Aero Squadron, First Lieutenant Ralph A. O&#x27;Neill of the 147th Aero Squadron, and Glen A. Preston, an aerial observation pilot with the 99th Aero Squadron. Among other prominent aviators were Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, the Chief of Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force; Second Lieutenant Frank Luke of the 27th Aero Squadron, who was honored with the Medal of Honor and two Distinguished Service Crosses; and Sumner Sewall of the 95th Aero Squadron, recipient of two Distinguished Service Crosses, who served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945. Edward Peck Curtis, also of the 95th Aero Squadron received the Distinguished Service Cross as a first lieutenant.

Colonel John H. Parker, the commander of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th Division, was the only ground soldier in World War I to receive four Distinguished Service Crosses. First Lieutenant Oscar B. Nelson of the 168th Infantry Regiment, 42nd Division, was honored three times, the third award being posthumous.

Several men who had previously received the Medal of Honor received the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I. Most notable of these was Marine Corps legend, Sergeant Major Daniel Daly, who was twice decorated with the Medal of Honor, and who received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism as First Sergeant of the 73rd Company, Sixth Marine Regiment, during the Battle of Belleau Wood in June 1918. Colonel Charles E. Kilbourne, who received the Medal of Honor in the Philippine Insurrection, was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross as chief of staff of the 89th Division. First Lieutenant James B. McConnell, also decorated with the Medal of Honor for actions in the Philippines as a private with the 33rd Infantry, received the Distinguished Service Cross posthumously as a first lieutenant with the 4th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division.

Marine Corps Colonel Hiram I. Bearss, recipient of the Medal of Honor in the Philippines, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross while attached to the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th Division. Marine Gunner Henry L. Hulbert, also a recipient of the Navy Medal of Honor in the Philippines, received the Distinguished Service Cross for bravery while serving with the 5th Marine Regiment during the Battle of Belleau Wood. Spanish–American War Medal of Honor recipient John H. Quick also received the Distinguished Service Cross at Belleau Wood as Sergeant Major of the Sixth Marine Regiment.

Besides Rickenbacker, several men received both the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross during World War I. Navy recipients were John Henry Balch, a U.S. Navy Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate, and Joel T. Boone, a U.S. Navy Lieutenant (Medical Corps), both attached to the Sixth Marine Regiment. Army recipients were Private Daniel R. Edwards of the 3rd Machine-Gun Battalion, 1st Division, Colonel William J. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan of the 165th Infantry Regiment, 42nd Division, and Second Lieutenant Samuel I. Parker of the 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division.

Two recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross during World War I went on to earn the Medal of Honor in World War II – Major (later Brigadier General) Theodore Roosevelt Jr. of the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, son of the former president, and Brigadier General (later General of the Army) Douglas MacArthur of the 42nd Division. Other recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I who went on to acclaim in World War II include George S. Patton Jr. and Carl Spaatz.

Among other prominent recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross during World War I were Brigadier General John L. Hines, decorated as commanding general of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, and Major General Charles Pelot Summerall, decorated as commanding general of the 1st Division, who both went on to serve as Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Private Sam Ervin of the 28th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, went on to serve as a United States Senator from the state of North Carolina. Major Dwight F. Davis, decorated as Assistant Chief of Staff of the 69th Infantry Brigade, 35th Division, founded the Davis Cup international tennis competition and served as United States Secretary of War in the Coolidge Administration. Father John B. DeValles, chaplain (first lieutenant), known as the Angel of the Trenches for administering to the needs of both Allied and German soldiers. He founded the first Portuguese parochial school at the Espirito Santo Church in Fall River, Massachusetts. B. Caroll Reece, decorated as a First Lieutenant with the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th Division, went on to represent the state of Tennessee in the United States House of Representatives for a total of 17 terms. Twenty one African American soldiers from the 370th Infantry Regiment received the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for action in both the Meuse–Argonne and Oise–Aisne campaigns.

===Between the World Wars===
In the immediate aftermath of World War I, 62 awards were made for actions in North Russia and Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Also, approximately 132 retroactive awards were made for actions in previous conflicts, including the Indian Wars, the Spanish–American War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Mexican border conflicts. Fifteen soldiers previously awarded Certificates of Merit for non-combat gallantry between 1899 and 1917 were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

Prominent among post-World War I Distinguished Service Cross recipients for acts before that war was General J. Franklin Bell, Chief of Staff of the Army from 1906 to 1910. A recipient of the Medal of Honor during the Philippine Insurrection, in 1925 he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for bravery in the Spanish–American War in 1898. In 1920, General Peyton C. March, then serving as Chief of Staff of the Army, was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for bravery in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War when he was a 1st lieutenant. March&#x27;s successor, General of the Armies John J. Pershing, received a Distinguished Service Cross in 1941 for bravery during the Philippine Insurrection. Second Lieutenant Gordon Johnston and Corporal Arthur M. Ferguson, both Medal of Honor recipients for the Philippine Insurrection, were also awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for other acts of bravery in the Philippines. Future Governor of American Samoa Otto Dowling received the cross for displaying bravery while responding to a fire at Lake Denmark Powder Depot, which he commanded at the time.

Among the recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross for Siberia and North Russia were Robert L. Eichelberger, who would earn a second medal in World War II, and Sidney C. Graves, who had previously received a Distinguished Service Cross in World War I.

===World War II===
During World War II, just over 5,000 awards were made. Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel John C. Meyer, Major General James A. Van Fleet, and Master Sergeant Llewellyn Chilson were three-time recipients. Jeannette Guyot and Virginia Hall were the only two women to receive the award.

A number of recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross in earlier conflicts were again honored in World War II. Chester Hirschfelder, who as a captain with the 5th Machine Gun Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, had received his first Distinguished Service Cross in 1918, received two more in 1944 as a colonel commanding the 9th Infantry Regiment of that same division. Three recipients of two Distinguished Service Crosses in World War IDouglas MacArthur, Hanford MacNider and Harry H. Semmesreceived their third in World War II. A handful of men who had received the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I received a second in World War II. Among these were George S. Patton Jr., whose second Distinguished Service Cross came as commanding general of the Seventh Army in Sicily, and Fred L. Walker, commander of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division in the breakout from Anzio and advance on Rome. Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, whose first Distinguished Service Cross was awarded for valor in Siberia in 1919, received a second for valor in New Guinea in the Buna campaign of 1942–43.

A little over fifty soldiers (and one sailor) received two Distinguished Service Crosses in World War II. The sailor was John D. Bulkeley, who also received the Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross and was one of the most highly decorated Americans of World War II. Among Army recipients of two Distinguished Service Crosses were Creighton W. Abrams Jr., later the Chief of Staff of the Army, William O. Darby, one of the fathers of the U.S. Army Rangers, and Robert T. Frederick, commander of the U.S-Canadian 1st Special Service Force. Six men of the 82nd Airborne Division received two Distinguished Service Crosses: Charles Billingslea, James M. Gavin, Arthur F. Gorham, Matthew B. Ridgway, Reuben Henry Tucker III and Benjamin H. Vandervoort. Several fighter pilots also received two Distinguished Service Crosses, including Donald Blakeslee, Paul P. Douglas Jr., William E. Dyess, Dominic &quot;Don&quot; Gentile, Gerald R. Johnson, Charles &quot;Mac&quot; MacDonald, James B. Morehead, Jay T. &quot;Cock&quot; Robbins, David C. Schilling, Jesús A. Villamor, William T. Whisner Jr. and Ray S. Wetmore. Bomber pilot Richard H. Carmichael also received two Distinguished Service Crosses.

The commander of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, U.S. 101st Airborne Division, Richard Winters, received a Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the assault on Brecourt Manor on D-Day; a member of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, U.S. 101st Airborne Division, Harrison C. Summers received a Distinguished Service Cross for his role on the assault to capture a building complex nearby designated &quot;WXYZ&quot; on the field order map.

During World War II, twelve soldiers, three airmen, and two sailors received both the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross: from the Army, Bernard P. Bell, Maurice L. &quot;Footsie&quot; Britt, Herbert H. Burr, Leonard A. Funk, Gerry H. Kisters, James M. Logan, George L. Mabry Jr., Douglas MacArthur, Audie L. Murphy, Junior J. Spurrier, Jack L. Treadwell and Jonathan M. Wainwright; from the Army Air Forces, Richard I. Bong, Horace S. Carswell Jr. and Thomas B. McGuire Jr.; and from the Navy, John D. Bulkeley and Samuel D. Dealey (who also received four Navy Crosses). One World War II Distinguished Service Cross recipient, Raymond Harvey, would earn the Medal of Honor in the Korean War.

General Paul W. Tibbets, commander of the 509th Composite Group (509 CG), was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General Spaatz for piloting the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress plane which dropped the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima.

===Korean War===
In the Korean War, there were just over 800 awards, of which over 300 were posthumous.

Robert R. Martin, colonel with the 24th Infantry Division was a first recipient in the Korean war.

Lloyd L. &quot;Scooter&quot; Burke, a lieutenant with the 1st Cavalry Division, Benjamin F. Wilson, a master sergeant with the 7th Infantry Division, Lewis Millett, a captain with the 27th Infantry Regiment and Air Force fighter ace George A. Davis Jr., each earned both the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross in Korea.

Colonel Arthur Champeny, previously decorated for bravery at Saint-Mihiel in September 1918 and a second time at Santa Maria Infante, Italy in May 1944, received a third Distinguished Service Cross in September 1950. Fighter pilot William T. Whisner, recipient of two Distinguished Service Crosses in World War II, was awarded a third in Korea.

Other foreign recipients came from the Belgian, British, French, Greek, Philippine, South Korean and Turkish armies. Soldiers serving with the Greek Expeditionary Force received 6 Distinguished Service Crosses in total during the Korean War.

===Vietnam War===
There were just over 1,000 awards in the Vietnam War, almost 400 of which were posthumous.
Patrick Brady, a helicopter pilot with the 44th Medical Brigade, and Robert L. Howard, a Special Forces NCO, received both the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross in Vietnam. Major General Keith L. Ware, who had earned the Medal of Honor in World War II and who was killed in action in September 1968, received a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross.

James F. Hollingsworth, who received a Distinguished Service Cross in April 1945 as commander of 2nd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, received a second award in November 1966 as assistant division commander of the 1st Infantry Division, and a third in March 1967 as acting division commander of the 1st Infantry Division. He was the subject of the narrative &quot;The General Goes Zapping Charlie Cong&quot;. Thomas H. Tackaberry, who received his first Distinguished Service Cross in Korea, received a second in September 1966 as a battalion commander with the 1st Cavalry Division and a third in September 1969 as commander of the 196th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. Both later rose to lieutenant general.

One World War II recipient, William E. DePuy, and two Korean War recipients, Richard E. Cavazos and Ralph Puckett Jr., received a second Distinguished Service Cross in Vietnam. Both DePuy and Cavazos would later rise to full general.

Besides Hollingsworth and Tackaberry, eleven other soldiers earned two Distinguished Service Crosses in Vietnam. Two, John R. Deane Jr. and Barry R. McCaffrey, later rose to full general, and a third, Henry E. Emerson, retired as a lieutenant general. McCaffrey also served as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Clinton Administration. Colonel David H. Hackworth, who also received ten Silver Stars in Korea and Vietnam, later rose to prominence as a military affairs journalist. George S. Patton IV, son of a two-time Distinguished Service Cross recipient, received two Distinguished Service Crosses in 1968 as commander of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. Sergeant Adelbert Waldron III, twice awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1969 as a sniper with the 9th Infantry Division, is credited with 109 confirmed kills, the most among U.S. snipers. Dennis Tomcik, a first lieutenant with the 47th Infantry Regiment, was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for two separate actions in 1968 in the Kien Hoa Province.

Alexander M. Haig Jr., also decorated in March 1967 as a battalion commander in the 1st Infantry Division, preceded General Rogers as SACEUR, and became Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. Former West Point football All-American, then Captain Bill Carpenter, &quot;The Lonesome End&quot;, received the award in 1966, and would go on to retire as a major general.

First Lieutenant Norman A. Mordue received the Distinguished Service Cross for valor in May 1967 while serving with the 1st Cavalry Division. He was appointed to the U.S. federal bench in 1998 and in 2006 became the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. Eldon Bargewell, decorated in 1971 as a staff sergeant with MACV-SOG, was later commissioned and as of early 2006 was a major general on the staff of Multi-National Force Iraq and the only Vietnam-era DSC recipient still on active duty. David Christian, described as the &quot;Youngest Most Decorated Officer of the Vietnam War&quot;, received the Distinguished Service Cross recipient while leading a long range reconnaissance patrol of the 1st Infantry Division, and later became a prominent advocate for veterans.

Among Distinguished Service Cross recipients for valor in the early battles in Vietnam were four members of the 1st Cavalry Division decorated for valor in the Battle of Ia Drang Valley in November 1965 – Lt. Col. Hal Moore who later became a Lieutenant General, Major Bruce Crandall, and two other members of their unit. The actions of all four were later portrayed in the film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, based on Hal Moore&#x27;s book on the battle. Crandall&#x27;s Distinguished Service Cross was later upgraded to the Medal of Honor, which was presented to him in February 2007.

Six Distinguished Service Crosses were awarded to Son Tay raiders, participants in the November 1970 attempt to rescue U.S. POWs in North Vietnam. Among the recipients were Special Forces soldiers Richard J. &quot;Dick&quot; Meadows and Arthur D. &quot;Bull&quot; Simons.

===1975 to present===
After the Vietnam War, the Distinguished Service Cross has been awarded multiple times. , it has been awarded 16 times for actions during Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan. , the Distinguished Service Cross has been awarded 13 times for actions during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Master Sergeant David R. Halbruner was awarded the medal for his actions during the 2012 Benghazi attack; there has also been only one award for actions during the 2015 Bamako hotel attack.

==Notable recipients==

Note that the inclusion of one, or more, Oak Leaf Clusters signifies each additional Distinguished Service Cross awarded to that recipient.


==Revocation==
In a number of cases, an award of the Distinguished Service Cross has later been revoked. In most cases, this has been for one of three reasons: the award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor, duplicate awards had been made to the same recipient for the same action by two different headquarters, or the award had been revoked to allow republication with a new and revised award citation. Such revocations have occurred over the history of the decoration.

One of the earliest such cases involves one of the most famous American soldiers of World War I, Alvin York, who initially received a Distinguished Service Cross which was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. And as noted above under &quot;Notable Recipients&quot;, top American World War I ace pilot Eddie Rickenbacker originally received eight DSCs, but one was upgraded in 1930 to the Medal of Honor. In 1980, MSG Roy P. Benavidez, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, had his Vietnam-era DSC upgraded to the Medal of Honor, which was presented to him by President Reagan at a Pentagon ceremony on February 24, 1981.

A number of DSC revocations and upgrades to the Medal of Honor were the result of reviews initiated by the Army or mandated by the United States Congress. In the early 1990s the Army began a review of discrimination against black soldiers in World War II, none of whom had received the Medal of Honor but several of whom had received lesser awards. Later, the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 provided for a &quot;Review Regarding Upgrading of Distinguished-Service Crosses and Navy Crosses Awarded to Asian-Americans and Native American Pacific Islanders for World War II Service&quot; and the National Defense Authorization Act for 2002 provided for a &quot;Review Regarding Award of Medal of Honor to Certain Jewish American and Hispanic American War Veterans&quot;. There is currently a petition circulating to upgrade the Distinguished Service Cross of Major Richard Winters to a Medal of Honor.

In January 1997, as a result of its review, the Army revoked six awards of the Distinguished Service Cross to black soldiers and upgraded them to the Medal of Honor. These were to Vernon Baker, Edward A. Carter Jr., John R. Fox, Willy F. James Jr., Charles L. Thomas and George Watson. In 2001, the Army officially revoked 21 awards of the Distinguished Service Cross and one of the Silver Star to Asian-American soldiers, mostly Japanese-American, whose awards were upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Among those whose DSC was upgraded was U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye. Others include Francis B. Wai and Rudolph B. Davila.

Jon E. Swanson, posthumously awarded a DSC in 1972, had this revoked in November 2005 (Department of the Army General Order No. 9 of 2005), after his DSC was upgraded to the Medal of Honor in December 2002 (Department of the Army General Order No. 14 of 2002). Another Vietnam War helicopter pilot, Bruce P. Crandall, was awarded the DSC in June 2001 (General Order No. 25 of 2001). This award was rescinded in November 2005 when a new citation was issued (General Order No. 9 of 2005), but the DSC itself was later upgraded to the Medal of Honor, which was presented in February 2007 (the DSC was revoked in General Order No. 3 of 2007).

<doc id="482918" wikidata="Q454213" url="?curid=482918" title="Tomás Mac Giolla">
<text>Tomás Mac Giolla (; born Thomas Gill; 25 January 1924 – 4 February 2010) was an Irish Workers&#x27; Party politician who served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1993 to 1994, Leader of the Workers&#x27; Party from 1962 to 1988 and President of Sinn Féin from 1962 to 1970. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin West constituency from 1982 to 1992.

==Early life==
He was born Thomas Gill in Nenagh, County Tipperary. His uncle T. P. Gill was a Member of Parliament (MP) and member of the Irish Parliamentary Party of Charles Stewart Parnell. Tomás&#x27;s father Robert Paul Gill, an engineer and architect, also stood unsuccessfully for election on a number of occasions. His mother was Mary Hourigan.

Mac Giolla was educated at the local national school in Nenagh before completing his secondary education at St. Flannan&#x27;s College, Ennis, County Clare. While at St. Flannan&#x27;s, he changed to using the Irish language version of his name. He won a scholarship to University College Dublin where he qualified with a Bachelor of Arts degree, followed by a degree in Commerce.

A qualified Accountant, Mac Giolla was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board (ESB) from 1947 until he went into full-time politics in 1977.

In his early life Mac Giolla was an active republican. He joined Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) around 1950. He was interned by the government of Ireland during the 1956–62 IRA border campaign. He also served a number of prison sentences in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin.

In 1961, he married May McLoughlin who was also an active member of Sinn Féin as well as of Cumann na mBan, the women&#x27;s section of the IRA. She died on 24 March 2018.

==Political career==
===1960s===

At the 1961 general election, Mac Giolla unsuccessfully contested the Tipperary North constituency for Sinn Féin.

In 1962, he became president of Sinn Féin, and was part of the leadership that moved the party to the left during the 1960s. 

In 1970, Sinn Féin split and Mac Giolla remained leader of Official Sinn Féin, with a faction led by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh initially known as Provisional Sinn Féin. Initially, Mac Giolla&#x27;s approach to his former comrades in the Provisional movement was one of conciliation, though over time, bitterness emerged. He was firm in his belief that the rise of the Provisionals was largely due to support from elements within Fianna Fáil. As violence in Northern Ireland escalated, Mac Giolla reiterated that the Official IRA (OIRA) favoured mass popular resistance, but would resort to &quot;retaliatory&quot; military action when deemed necessary. In contrast, he condemned the Provisionals&#x27; armed struggle, labelling it both counterproductive and sectarian. This stance sometimes led to confusion. 

After the OIRA killed Unionist Northern Ireland Senator John Barnhill, Mac Giolla initially blamed British agents. However, the Officials later admitted and defended the operation as a necessary retaliation against repression. Following Bloody Sunday on 30 January 1972 the OIRA bombed the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment. This resulted in the deaths of seven people, including five female cleaners. Mac Giolla expressed shock at the attack and attributed it to an ineffective bomb maker. The question of how far the OIRA should go in using armed force was one of the issues that led to the ceasefire in May 1972, which Mac Giolla fully supported. The Officials argued that the violence was deepening sectarian divisions and preventing unity between workers. In a speech at Carrickmore, County Tyrone, in July 1972, Mac Giolla stated that &quot;the Irish revolution … demands the support of the Protestant working class,&quot; asserting that the violence of August 1969 had been carried out not by ordinary Protestants against Catholics, but by the B Specials and some members of the Orange Order. He also claimed that the Provisional IRA&#x27;s campaign was pushing Protestants towards reaction. By 1978, Mac Giolla was asserting that &quot;the Provos are engaged in a war against the Irish people … can anyone say that the atrocities of the infamous Black and Tans were any worse?&quot; This sharp criticism of the Provisional IRA became a defining feature of Mac Giolla&#x27;s rhetoric and that of his party.

In 1969 he attended and spoke at a march in opposition to the Vietnam War in Dublin.

===1970s===
In November 1973 Tomás Mac Giolla addressed the World Congress of Peace Forces in Moscow, at a time when the Officials were becoming increasingly associated with Eastern Bloc socialism. While Mac Giolla had previously criticised the Soviet system, he never fully explained when or why his stance changed. He later suggested that Cuba would be a more suitable model for Ireland than the Eastern European states. Despite his prominent role, Mac Giolla was not the primary architect of these ideological shifts within the party. His more traditional republican outlook continued to cause unease among some members. As president of Official Sinn Féin, however, Mac Giolla played a crucial role in steering the party towards electoral politics, a process that was further solidified in 1977 when the party added &quot;The Workers&#x27; Party&quot; to its name. His popularity among the rank and file helped ease concerns within the movement, particularly for those who viewed the name change as a further departure from its republican roots. In 1982 the party became simply the Workers&#x27; Party.

Mac Giolla was elected to Dublin City Council representing the Ballyfermot local electoral area in 1979 and at every subsequent local election until he retired from the council in 1997. 

===1980s===
In the November 1982 general election Mac Giolla was elected to Dáil Éireann for his party. In 1988, he stepped down as party leader and was succeeded by Proinsias De Rossa. He served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1993 to 1994, the first Workers&#x27; Party councillor to serve as Lord Mayor, and remained a member of Dublin Corporation until 1998.

===1990s to 2010===
While president he was regarded as a mediator between the Marxist–Leninist wing headed by Seán Garland and the social democratic wing of Proinsias De Rossa. At the 1992 special Ardfheis he voted for the motion to abandon democratic centralism and to re-constitute the party much as the Italian Communist Party became the Democratic Party of the Left. However the motion failed to reach the required two-thirds majority and after the departure of six Workers&#x27; Party TDs led by De Rossa to form the new Democratic Left party in 1992, Mac Giolla was the sole member of the Workers&#x27; Party in the Dáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the general election later that year by a margin of just 59 votes to Liam Lawlor of Fianna Fáil. In 1999, Mac Giolla wrote to the chairman of the Flood Tribunal calling for an investigation into revelations that former Dublin Assistant City and County Manager George Redmond had been the official supervisor at the election count in Dublin West and was a close associate of Liam Lawlor. In 2003, Redmond was convicted of corruption by a Dublin court but subsequently had his conviction quashed due to conflicting evidence.

In his eighties, Mac Giolla continued to be active and was a member of the group which campaigned to prevent the demolition of No. 16 Moore Street in Dublin city centre, where the surrender after the Easter Rising was completed. He also served on the Dublin &#x27;98 committee to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the 1798 Rebellion.

He died in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin on 4 February 2010 after a long illness.

<doc id="482923" wikidata="Q436181" url="?curid=482923" title="Síle de Valera">
<text>Síle de Valera (; born 17 December 1954) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as a Minister of State from 2002 to 2006 and as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands from 1997 to 2002. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1977 to 1981 and from 1987 to 2007. She was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 1979 to 1984.

==Early and personal life==
Síle de Valera was born in 1954, in Dublin, Ireland to Terence de Valera (1922–2007), the youngest child of Éamon de Valera, and his wife Phyllis Blake (1920–2002). She has a younger sister. She was educated at Loreto College, Foxrock and at University College Dublin, where she qualified as a career guidance teacher. De Valera&#x27;s grandfather, Éamon de Valera, was the founder of Fianna Fáil, a Taoiseach and the third President of Ireland. She is a niece of Vivion de Valera, a former TD, and is a first cousin of Éamon Ó Cuív, a TD who succeeded her as a minister.

==Political career==
De Valera was first elected to Dáil Éireann in the Fianna Fáil landslide victory at the 1977 general election. She was elected for the Dublin County Mid constituency, which included the Tallaght area of County Dublin, being the youngest TD elected at that election. In June 1979, she was elected to the European Parliament for a five-year term. Later that year she was one of the Fianna Fáil TDs who criticised the policies of Taoiseach Jack Lynch in relation to Northern Ireland, and was a prominent supporter of Charles Haughey, who succeeded him as Taoiseach in December 1979. She was highly critical of Margaret Thatcher and the British Government, and became a noted supporter of the Anti H-Block movement. She called on nationalists to vote for Bobby Sands in the 1981 by-election, which he won. She also controversially called on Fianna Fáil voters to give preference votes for Anti H-Block candidates in the 1981 general election.
She held her Dáil seat until the 1981 general election, when the constituency boundaries were redrawn. She sought re-election in the new constituency of Dublin South. This caused tension within the local Fianna Fáil party, for one of the other candidates, Séamus Brennan, was a prominent opponent of Haughey. De Valera narrowly failed to be elected, losing to another Fianna Fáil candidate, Niall Andrews. She contested the constituency again at the February 1982 general election, but saw her vote drop, and once again failed to be elected.

At the November 1982 general election she sought election to the Clare constituency, where one of the sitting TDs, Bill Loughnane—a fellow supporter of Haughey—had died. Clare was the constituency her grandfather Éamon de Valera had represented from 1917 to 1959. Again, she narrowly failed to be elected, but remained living in the constituency, and at the 1987 general election she was elected a TD for Clare. She was re-elected there at every election until her retirement in 2007.

De Valera resigned briefly from Fianna Fáil in 1993, due to the removal of the &#x27;stopover&#x27; at Shannon Airport. She was persuaded to rejoin the party in 1994 by its new leader, Bertie Ahern; he then appointed her to the opposition front bench. In 1997, she was appointed as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. She introduced broadcasting legislation in 1999 to ensure that the public could continue to watch the most important sporting events on ordinary television. A speech given by de Valera in Boston about her fear of closer EU integration stimulated a debate on whether Ireland&#x27;s economic and social values were closer to those of the USA or the EU, &quot;Boston or Berlin&quot;. She lost her place in the cabinet in 2002, but was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, with special responsibility for Adult Education, Youth Affairs and Educational Disadvantage.

On 11 November 2005, she announced her intention to retire at the following election. She resigned as Minister of State on 8 December 2006, and was succeeded by a member of another Irish political family, Seán Haughey.
