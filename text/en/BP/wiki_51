<text>Steven Lee &quot;Luke&quot; Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known as the sole continuous founding member of the rock band Toto. His reputation as a skilled guitarist led to a steady flow of session work beginning in the 1970s that has since established him as a prolific session musician, recording guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums spanning a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Notably, Lukather played guitar on Boz Scaggs&#x27; albums &quot;Down Two Then Left&quot; (1977) and &quot;Middle Man&quot; (1980), and was a prominent contributor to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). Lukather has released nine solo albums, the latest of which, &quot;Bridges&quot;, was released in June 2023.

Influenced by blues-rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, and such jazz fusion players as Al Di Meola and John McLaughlin, Lukather is known for a &quot;melodic and intense&quot; playing style. He is also recognized for his efficiency in the studio, often recording tracks in one take using minimal sound processing. While he once used many guitar effects in the studio and on stage, he now frequently disparages such practice, and instead advocates cleaner tones and minimal studio processing. Lukather plays primarily a signature electric guitar manufactured by Ernie Ball Music Man bearing his nickname, Luke. He also plays Yamaha and Ovation Adamas series acoustic–electric guitars.

==Early life==
Steven Lee Lukather was born on October 21, 1957, in the San Fernando Valley, California. His father was an assistant director and production manager at Paramount Studios, and worked on shows such as &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. Lukather first played keyboards and drums, and then taught himself how to play the guitar starting at age seven, when his father bought him a copy of the Beatles album &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; and a Kay acoustic guitar. Lukather has said that the album &quot;changed his life&quot; and that he was greatly influenced by the guitar playing of George Harrison in particular.

At Grant High School, Lukather met David Paich and the Porcaro brothers (Jeff, Steve, and Mike), all of whom eventually became members of Toto. Lukather, who had been a self-taught musician, began taking guitar lessons from Jimmy Wyble. With Wyble, Lukather expanded his knowledge of wider aspects of music, including orchestration. It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested in the idea of becoming a session musician, a vocation that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians.

Jeff Porcaro, who had been playing drums with Steely Dan since 1973, became a mentor to Lukather and nurtured his interest in session work. Lukather&#x27;s first job in the music industry was studio work with Boz Scaggs, after which Paich and Jeff Porcaro—who had become prominent session musicians in their own right—asked Lukather to join them in forming Toto in 1976 along with Bobby Kimball, David Hungate, and Steve Porcaro.

==Toto==
Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band&#x27;s entire history, as well as composer and lead and backing vocalist. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band&#x27;s songwriting efforts during the development of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Toto&quot;—he penned all but two of the album&#x27;s tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. His first song writing credit is &quot;Hydra&quot;, which he co-wrote with the rest of the band for their second self-titled album. However, Lukather&#x27;s role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role.
Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Tambu&quot; except for two instrumental tracks. The &quot;Tambu&quot; single &quot;I Will Remember&quot;, co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some &quot;Tambu&quot; reviewers contrasted Lukather&#x27;s vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band&#x27;s live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Toto XX&quot; that Lukather returned primarily to the role of backup vocalist.

Lukather&#x27;s songwriting contributions grew from a few tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing almost every track starting in the late 1980s. Lukather admitted that the reason why he has no songwriting contributions on the first two Toto albums was that he wasn&#x27;t writing many songs at the time, being intimidated by the talent of the band&#x27;s chief songwriter, David Paich. He credits Paich with encouraging him to contribute more songs to the band. He wrote very few of Toto&#x27;s songs by himself, an exception being the hit single &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot; from &quot;Toto IV&quot;. Lukather has said that writing lyrics is not one of his strengths. Thus, he collaborated with other band members to complete song ideas and make them into viable album tracks. Lukather&#x27;s official site claims he contributed to writing all the songs on Toto&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Falling in Between&quot;, even though &quot;Spiritual Man&quot; officially credits Paich as the sole writer.

By 2008, Lukather was the only original Toto member still performing with the band: Bobby Kimball was also in the band at the time, but had been absent from it for some time – whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation. However, in June of the same year, Lukather decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band. In a 2011 interview discussing his career with Toto, Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing. In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. They continued to tour on a limited basis in 2011 and 2012.

Although Lukather indicated in April 2011 that the band would not record any further material, Toto announced an international tour schedule and new studio album in March 2014. In March 2015 &quot;Toto XIV&quot; was released. The band toured in celebration of its 40th anniversary from 2016 to 2019, when Lukather announced an indefinite hiatus. A new Toto lineup converged in 2020 to resume performances, featuring Lukather and Williams as the only members persisting from previous lineups, though Paich would still make guest appearances and is considered an official member. The group has virtual livestream performances and eventual live concerts planned for 2020 and 2021, with John Pierce on bass guitar, Robert &quot;Sput&quot; Searight on drums, Steve Maggiora on keyboards, Dominique &quot;Xavier&quot; Taplin on keyboards, and Warren Ham providing additional vocals.

On January 10, 2024, the band announced &quot;The Dogz of Oz&quot; lineup and officially welcomed back Greg Phillinganes (Keyboards) and Shannon Forrest (Drums), along with a touring schedule extending into 2025.

==Session work==
Lukather achieved notability in the 1970s and 1980s as one of the most sought-after session guitarists in Los Angeles, playing with a wide range of artists from Aretha Franklin to Warren Zevon. He has performed on over 1,500 records spanning 36 years. Music journalist Jude Gold noted, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather.&quot; Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years: &quot;There is no &#x27;session guy&#x27; thing any more—not like it was. It&#x27;s not like the old days when I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone.&quot; His own output as a session musician has slowed along with the rest of the industry—as of 2009, Lukather stated he was doing only a few sessions a year.

Named by Gibson Guitar Corporation as one of the Top 10 session guitarists of all time, Lukather has performed on many notable tracks, including Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s Physical album Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s &quot;Faces&quot; album, soloing on the tracks &quot;Back on the Road&quot; and &quot;You Went Away&quot;, two tracks from the Lionel Richie album &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;, and the Richard Marx album &quot;Repeat Offender&quot;. Lukather and Jeff Porcaro were heavily involved in the recording of virtually all of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. Mark Ronson has said, &quot;I&#x27;ve done way more time Googling Lukather&#x27;s tone on &#x27;Beat It&#x27; than . . . Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the tone that drives the whole record - that&#x27;s the riff.&quot; In addition to recording guitar tracks, Lukather has also written or produced music for Lionel Richie, Richard Marx, Chicago, Donna Summer, and The Tubes. He won a Grammy award in 1982 for the George Benson song &quot;Turn Your Love Around&quot; (co-written with Jay Graydon and Bill Champlin).

==Solo albums==

Lukather has released nine solo studio albums: &quot;Lukather&quot; (1989), &quot;Candyman&quot; (1994), &quot;Luke&quot; (1997), &quot;Santamental&quot; (2003), &quot;Ever Changing Times&quot; (2008), &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (2010), &quot;Transition&quot; (2013), &quot;I Found the Sun Again&quot; (2021), and &quot;Bridges&quot; (2023).

===1989–1997: &quot;Lukather&quot;, &quot;Candyman&quot;, and &quot;Luke&quot;===
The 1989 album &quot;Lukather&quot; came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise—counting off on various tracks, for instance—is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single &quot;Swear Your Love&quot; came from the album.

&quot;Candyman&quot;, recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather&#x27;s band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Peña, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether &quot;Candyman&quot; was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of &quot;Candyman&quot; were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather&#x27;s; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song &quot;Red House&quot;. The European release of &quot;Candyman&quot; was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as &quot;Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys&quot; and sometimes as just &quot;Los Lobotomys&quot;. The song &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; was released as a single in Europe and included &quot;Red House&quot; as a B-side.

Lukather describes 1997&#x27;s &quot;Luke&quot; as a much different and more &quot;introspective&quot; album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather&#x27;s musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. &quot;Luke&quot; is an experimental album, and like &quot;Candyman&quot; it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. &quot;Luke&quot; also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of &quot;Luke&quot; includes a version of the Jeff Beck song &quot;The Pump&quot;. The song &quot;Hate Everything About U&quot; was released as a single.

===2003: &quot;Santamental&quot;===

&quot;Santamental&quot;, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather&#x27;s record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, &quot;But I never dreamt in a million years that I&#x27;d do a Christmas record.&quot;

The musicians Lukather chose for &quot;Santamental&quot;, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for &quot;Joy to the World&quot; after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; along with Lukather&#x27;s son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition &quot;Broken Heart for Christmas&quot;. Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the &quot;Keith Richards of our generation&quot;. Well-known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song &quot;Look Out For Angels&quot;, and there is a version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis Jr. &quot;Santamental&quot; was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it &quot;his first and last Christmas album&quot;.

===2008–2013: &quot;Ever Changing Times&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, and &quot;Transition&quot;===

&quot;Ever Changing Times&quot;, released on February 22, 2008, is a collection of songs Lukather recorded in 2007 between Toto tours. The album contains contributions from fellow session musicians Bill Champlin, Abe Laboriel, Jr., Leland Sklar, Steve Porcaro, and many others. Lukather&#x27;s son Trevor contributed as well. Joseph Williams provides backing vocals on five of the tracks. Lukather wrote the songs for the album in a hotel room with his son and a handful of other musicians, using basic equipment. His song-writing philosophy is that if a song sounds good with only guitars and vocals, it will likely sound good after a full production. Lukather collaborated with Grammy Award-winning engineer and producer Steve MacMillan on the project, with the goal of introducing some new methods and techniques into the recording process. Lukather described the final tracks as &quot;perfectly imperfect&quot;, preferring to record with the five-piece backing band in one room and in one take. MacMillan encouraged Lukather to use &quot;organic, vintage tones&quot;. As a result, Lukather eschewed effects and played the guitar parts directly through tube amplifiers manufactured by Marshall, Vox, and some boutique brands. Lukather commented that MacMillan served as a valuable &quot;second set of ears&quot; in the studio, often encouraging him to keep parts that he normally would have discarded. As Toto had recently disbanded when &quot;Ever Changing Times&quot; was released, Lukather embarked on a solo tour to promote the album. The shows featured a mixture of songs from the album, songs written for other side projects, and &quot;a few Toto obscurities&quot;.

Lukather&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, was released on October 11, 2010, in Europe and Japan, and November 16 as a digital download worldwide. The material was written predominantly in collaboration with longtime associate C. J. Vanston, and the album features stalwart musicians from Lukather&#x27;s touring band. Songwriter Randy Goodrum, who has collaborated with Lukather many times over the years including on the 1986 Toto single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be over You&quot;, contributes to the track &quot;Brody&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; draws from Lukather&#x27;s personal experiences in the two years since &quot;Ever Changing Times&quot;. Critic Arlene Weiss noted that the album features three distinct flavors of music: one that &quot;bares [Lukather&#x27;s] soul and emotional heartache&quot;, one that pans elements of popular culture like TMZ.com, and one that expresses optimism and enthusiasm about the future. While Lukather focused on instrumental writing and production on previous albums but collaborated with lyricists, he wrote much of the lyrics for &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; himself. Lukather describes the album as being a &quot;real&quot; and &quot;honest&quot; reflection of the period between 2008 and 2010, when he experienced difficulties within his private life.

In December 2011, Lukather announced the beginning of work on &quot;Transition&quot;. The album was produced with songwriter and record producer C.J. Vanston and involved musicians Chad Smith, Gregg Bissonette, Leland Sklar, Steve Weingart, and others. Throughout 2012, Lukather released notes and news of the album development through his web site. The title was announced on October 12, 2012. The album was released January 21, 2013.

===2020–present: &quot;I Found the Sun Again, Bridges&quot;===
After seven years without the release of any solo material, Lukather released a single entitled &quot;Run to Me&quot; on August 19, 2020. Two months later, he announced that he would release solo albums simultaneously with longtime Toto collaborator Joseph Williams. Lukather&#x27;s and Williams&#x27; albums, on which they mutually contributed, are entitled &quot;I Found the Sun Again&quot; and &quot;Denizen Tenant&quot;, respectively, and released on February 26, 2021. Lukather&#x27;s latest album is titled &quot;Bridges&quot; and was released on June 16, 2023. It is preceded by the first single, &quot;When I See You Again&quot;. On Instagram, he said &quot;My ninth solo album, &quot;Bridges&quot;, could not be more accurately titled. I see it as a bridge between my solo music and Toto music. This is as close as we will get to a new Toto record.&quot;

==Side projects==

When not working with Toto, Lukather has participated in numerous side projects including playing with jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys and with other session musicians, and touring with Larry Carlton, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and others.

Lukather was a long-time member of the band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of session musicians including jazz and be-bop player David &quot;Creatchy&quot; Garfield and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro, replaced after his death by Simon Phillips, who also replaced Porcaro in Toto. Los Lobotomys formed in the mid-1980s and played regular shows in the Los Angeles area, often inviting whatever session musicians happened to be available and in the area. They recorded an album under the Los Lobotomys name in 1989, and the band was heavily involved in the recording of Lukather&#x27;s &quot;Candyman&quot;. Los Lobotomys recorded a live album in 2004 comprising several tracks from &quot;Candyman&quot; and from the 1989 album.

In 1998, Lukather received an invitation to tour Japan with fellow guitarist Larry Carlton after Japanese promoters requested that Carlton&#x27;s annual tours each be different from the last. Lukather and Carlton exchanged some recorded material and decided that a collaboration would be interesting. Lukather was flattered by the invitation to tour with Carlton, citing him as his favorite guitarist. Lukather speaks highly of their stage efforts, although the two were admittedly outside their normal realm of work. He stated in an interview that &quot;you can hear us having fun on the record—you can hear the smiles on our faces.&quot; After several shows, the duo realized that they should record their collaboration even if just for their own use. Guitarist and producer Steve Vai heard one of the subsequent recordings and expressed interest in releasing it under his Favored Nations label, also home to such artists as Eric Johnson and Dweezil Zappa. Vai and Lukather mixed and produced the recording, which is said to be a mixture of jazz, blues, and fusion music. The resulting album, &quot;No Substitutions: Live in Osaka&quot;, won a 2001 Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Album reviewers described Lukather as having a heavier style than Carlton. Lukather and Carlton later did an international tour in support of the album.

In 2005, Lukather won critical praise for his rendition of the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Little Wing&quot; at a 90th birthday celebration for jazz guitarist Les Paul. Returning after a five-year absence, the 2012 G3 Tour featured Lukather alongside Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.

In the autumn of 2006, Lukather contributed his cover-version of the Michael Landau-song &quot;I&#x27;m Buzzed&quot; (originally from Landau&#x27;s &quot;Tales From The Bulge&quot; album) from a live recording of his side band project, El Grupo, to the album project Artists for Charity – Guitarists 4the Kids, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.

In February 2012, Ringo Starr announced that Lukather would be the guitarist in his All Starr Band for their summer tour. Lukather has been touring with that ensemble since that time, performing three Toto songs (&quot;Hold the Line&quot;, &quot;Rosanna&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot;) nightly.

Lukather contributes material and expertise to instructional and educational enterprises. In 1985, he released the instructional &quot;Star Licks&quot; guitar video featuring many of the guitar parts from the first five Toto studio albums. It was released on DVD in 2005. The guitarist has also been participating in the Fermatta Master Class Series project, an educational cooperative organized by the Fermatta Music Academy in Mexico.

Lukather has periodically performed with a side band named Nerve Bundle at The Baked Potato in Studio City, CA around Christmas time. The band features Toss Panos on drums, Jeff Babko on keyboards, and Jorgen Carlsson on bass.

In 2024, Lukather contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

==Musical style and equipment==

Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, and Jimmy Page, and such jazz fusion players as John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola, Lukather is known for a &quot;melodic and intense&quot; playing style. He has also cited Steely Dan as a major long-time influence—one that emerges prominently in later solo work such as &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. Journalist Jude Gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his &quot;exaggerated wide bends&quot; are distinctive and quickly recognizable. Well-versed in music theory, Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians—this ability enhances his value as a session musician. In interviews, he has explained how he thinks of the guitar in a &quot;chordal cluster&quot; format, and not the typical &quot;linear scale&quot; format.

Lukather&#x27;s approach to engineering his sound in the studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing a large number of takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: &quot;If a solo didn&#x27;t work—either because I didn&#x27;t have the right sound, or because I wasn&#x27;t inspired at that moment—I&#x27;d just move on. A part either works or it doesn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It&#x27;s always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears.&quot; Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.

Despite being known in the past for having an intricate set of effects units, Lukather now says he plays mostly free of such modifications after seeing some overdone commercial unit configurations named after him. Other than some delay, he has not used many effects in recent years. He has held a long association with Bob Bradshaw of Custom Audio Electronics, who designed and manufactured key elements of Lukather&#x27;s effects rack. Lukather was one of the few official endorsers of EMG pickups, having collaborated on his own Lukather signature &quot;SL20&quot; pickup system, which is in essence a &quot;loaded pickguard&quot; system incorporating two single-coil EMG SLV pickups and an EMG 85 humbucker. The system also has single master volume and tone knobs. In December 2012, Lukather collaborated with DiMarzio pickups on a new set of signature pickups called &quot;Transition&quot;. He has been using these pickups in his Music-Man Luke3 guitar.

Lukather endorses Music Man guitars and has a signature model named &quot;Luke&quot; that incorporated his signature EMG pickup system. The guitar started out with only MusicMan specifications (including a Floyd Rose locking vibrato, later replaced with a vintage-style fulcrum bridge), but in 1998, the manufacturer made several customizations to the model to better fit Lukather&#x27;s playing style. Music Man also produces a Ball Family Reserve Steve Lukather Model that features an alder body with a mahogany &quot;tone block&quot; inlaid under the pickups, capped with a figured maple top and transparent finish. In 2012 a new version of the guitar called the LIII was introduced with a 3% larger but similarly contoured body, all-rosewood neck and passive pickup options (dual humbucker or single-single-humbucker) combined with an active preamp and 12-dB boost activated from a push/push tone pot. the LIII model also debuted Lukather&#x27;s switch from EMG to custom DiMarzio &quot;Transition&quot; model pickups. In 2013 Lukather changed to a roasted maple neck with a rosewood fret board, citing the exceptional stability of roasted maple while touring as a factor in his decision. As a result, the LIII specification and production was changed to match Lukather&#x27;s preference. Lukather has also been known to play Ibanez and Valley Arts guitars. His relationship with Ibanez and Valley Arts yielded an endorsement for a brief time in the 1980s with the release of the Ibanez Roadstar RS1010SL and Valley Arts Custom Pro Steve Lukather Signature guitars in 1984–85. He has played Ovation Adamas series acoustic–electric guitars. Starting before his 2010 &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; tour, Lukather began playing and endorsing Yamaha Studio Response Technology acoustic–electric guitars.

Information about his current equipment can be found on Lukather&#x27;s website.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Lukather married singer Marie Currie (twin sister of Runaways frontwoman Cherie Currie), with whom he had collaborated on an album with her twin sister titled &quot;Messin&#x27; with the Boys&quot;. He and Currie had two children before divorcing by the early 1990s.

Lukather married his longtime girlfriend, Shawn Batten, in 2002. They had two children and divorced in 2010.

<doc id="476241" wikidata="Q334480" url="?curid=476241" title="George Reid (Scottish politician)">
<text>Sir George Newlands Reid (born 4 June 1939) is a Scottish politician and journalist who served as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2003 to 2007. A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Mid Scotland and Fife region from 1999 to 2003 and then for the Ochil constituency from 2003 to 2007. Reid was Member of Parliament (MP) for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire from February 1974 to 1979.

== Early life ==

Reid was born on 4 June 1939 in Tullibody, near Alloa, Clackmannanshire, the son of George Reid, a company director, and Margaret (née Forsyth). He was educated at Tullibody School and Dollar Academy. Reid attended the University of St Andrews, where he earned an MA with First-class honours in History in 1962. He then continued with further studies in Switzerland and at Union College in the United States, obtaining a diploma in international relations.

== Journalist career ==
Reid worked as a broadcast journalist and television producer for the BBC, Granada Television and Scottish Television, and as a print journalist for several newspapers. In this time he produced over 200 television documentaries, including Emmy winner &quot;Contract 736&quot;, about the construction of the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2.

After leaving Westminster he briefly returned to journalism. For BBC Scotland, he presented Agenda, which was produced by Kirsty Wark. He was producer of the famous reportage by Michael Buerk of the Ethiopian famine of 1984 that inspired the Band Aid and Live Aid charity campaigns, which led him to be headhunted by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent. He was part of an international disaster team that responded to the 1988 Armenian earthquake. He was Director of Public Affairs of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent for 12 years, based in Geneva, Switzerland, but working worldwide in conflict and disaster zones.

== Political career ==

=== Early political career ===
Reid was elected as the Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire in the February 1974 general election, with a majority of 3,610. He more than doubled his majority to 7,341 in the October 1974 general election, but then lost by a narrow 984 votes in the 1979 general election.

During his time at Westminster he served as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and that of the Western European Union.

In 1995 Reid re-entered Scottish politics by delivering the annual Donaldson Lecture at the SNP conference, drawing on his knowledge of continental European politics to argue a case for why a party like the SNP could be expected to prosper if a Scottish Parliament was established. Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland George Robertson&#x27;s contrary claim that devolution would &quot;kill the SNP stone dead&quot; was dismissed by Reid by saying &quot;Ho, ho, ho&quot;.

=== Election to Holyrood ===
He stood in the Ochil constituency, which covered approximately the same area as his old seat, at Westminster in the UK general election 1997, coming in second. When the new Labour administration moved forward with proposals for a Scottish Parliament, Reid first served on the pre-establishment Consultative Steering Group, and then was elected in the first election in 1999 to represent Mid Scotland and Fife.

At the opening of the Parliament Reid was defeated 82 votes to 44 by Sir David Steel for the position of Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and was instead elected a Deputy Presiding Officer.
=== Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament (2003–2007) ===
At the 2003 Scottish Parliament election Reid succeeded in winning the Ochil constituency first past the post. He was then elected by his fellow MSPs to succeed David Steel as Presiding Officer. As the Presiding Officer is expected to be strictly nonpartisan, he voluntarily suspended his SNP membership for the duration of his tenure.

As the Presiding Officer has a role in advising the monarch, Reid was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2004. He oversaw the completion of the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood and the move from the Mound to Holyrood in 2004. At the official opening of the new building that year, he made a keynote speech in which he paid tribute to the construction as an architectural achievement, and urged parliamentarians to &quot;listen to the building&quot; to inspire them in their future endeavours.

As Presiding Officer he also led the creation of a Scottish Futures Forum, to promote cross-party strategic thinking. He was appointed President of the Royal Commonwealth Society Scotland, and became Patron of the Scottish Disability Equality Forum.

== Post–Presiding Officer ==

Reid chose not to seek re-election at the end of the 2007 Parliamentary term. As an independent figure with experience of a devolved parliament, he was chosen to lead a review of the administration of the troubled Northern Ireland Assembly. Reid also joined the European Union&#x27;s Caucasus-Caspian diplomatic commission. On 19 April 2007 he was made a Freeman of the County of Clackmannanshire. He had his portrait taken by photographer Harry Benson the same year.

In May 2008, Reid was appointed as the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for the duration of the General Assembly&#x27;s sitting that year. He was then appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in January 2008, to serve as the Queen&#x27;s personal representative to the Church of Scotland. This position is second only to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in the ceremonial Order of Precedence.

In 2006 he was appointed by the University of Glasgow as an Honorary Professor in the School of Law. Between 2008 and 2011 he was an independent adviser on the Scottish Ministerial Code.

In September 2009, Reid was appointed by the National Trust for Scotland to lead a wide-ranging internal governance review. Reid produced a report, making a range of recommendations that were accepted by the Trust. In 2009, he was appointed as Her Majesty&#x27;s Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire.

He was an Electoral Commissioner from 2010 to 2014.

In 2013 he underwent major surgery for bladder cancer. He resigned all his positions, then made a good recovery.

==Awards and honours==
After relief efforts for the 1988 Armenian earthquake Reid was recognised with the Gold Medal of the Supreme Soviet of Armenia and the Pirogov Gold Medal of the USSR.

During his time as Presiding Officer he won the Herald newspaper&#x27;s Scottish Politician of the Year award in 2003 and 2005, becoming the first person to have won the award on two occasions, followed by a lifetime achievement award in 2013. Reid was made a Free man of Clackmannanshire in 2007.

He received also several honorary doctorates, i.e. an LLD degree from the University of St Andrews in 2005, a DUniv degree from Queen Margaret University in 2006, the degree of Dr.h.c. from the University of Edinburgh in 2007, and a DUniv degree from the University of Stirling in 2008.

Reid was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to Scottish politics and public life. In 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). 

On 10 June 2022, Reid was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle (KT).

<text>Nisin is a polycyclic antibacterial peptide produced by the bacterium &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; that is used as a food preservative. It has 34 amino acid residues, including the uncommon amino acids lanthionine (Lan), methyllanthionine (MeLan), didehydroalanine (Dha), and didehydroaminobutyric acid (Dhb). These unusual amino acids are introduced by posttranslational modification of the precursor peptide. In these reactions a ribosomally synthesized 57-mer is converted to the final peptide. The unsaturated amino acids originate from serine and threonine, and the enzyme-catalysed addition of cysteine residues to the didehydro amino acids result in the multiple (5) thioether bridges. 

Subtilin and epidermin are related to nisin. All are members of a class of molecules known as lantibiotics.

In the food industry, nisin is obtained from the culturing of &quot;L. lactis&quot; on natural substrates, such as dextrose, and it is not chemically synthesized.

It was originally isolated in the late 1930s, and produced since the 1950s as Nisaplin from naturally occurring sources by Aplin and Barrett in laboratories in Beaminster in Dorset (now owned by International Flavors &amp; Fragrances), and approved as an additive for food use in the US in the late 1960s.

==Properties==
While most bacteriocins generally inhibit only closely related species, nisin is a rare example of a &quot;broad-spectrum&quot; bacteriocin effective against many Gram-positive organisms, including lactic acid bacteria (commonly associated with avoiding food spoilage),&quot; Listeria monocytogenes&quot; (a known pathogen), &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;, &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, etc. It is also particularly effective against spores. Gram-negative bacteria are protected by their outer membrane but may become susceptible to nisin action after a heat shock or when this is coupled with the chelator EDTA. When used in combination with EDTA, nisin can inhibit &quot;E. coli O157:H7&quot; and &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot;. Nisin, as a class I bacteriocin, is very stable at acidic pHs and is more heat stable at lower pHs. The mode of action of Nisin against pathogens such as &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; is to dissipate the membrane potential and pH gradient.

Nisin is soluble in water and effective at levels nearing the parts-per-billion range. Nisin concentration can be measured using various techniques such as chromatography or by a simple agar diffusion bioassay.

== Applications ==

=== Food production ===
Nisin is used in processed cheese, meats, beverages, etc. during production to extend shelf life by suppressing Gram-positive spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. In foods, it is common to use nisin at levels ranging from ~1-25 ppm, depending on the food type and regulatory approval. As a food additive, nisin has an E number of E234. 

=== Other ===
Due to its naturally selective spectrum of activity, it is also employed as a selective agent in microbiological media to isolate gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and moulds.

Nisin has also been used in food packaging applications and can serve as a preservative by controlled release onto the food surface from the polymer packaging.

In combination with miconazole, it has been studied as a possible treatment for infections of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;.

<doc id="476247" wikidata="Q1183089" url="?curid=476247" title="Dehydroalanine">
<text>Dehydroalanine (Cα,β-didehydroalanine, α,β-di-dehydroalanine, 2-aminoacrylate, or 2,3-didehydroalanine) is a dehydroamino acid. It does not exist in its free form, but it occurs naturally as a residue found in peptides of microbial origin. As an amino acid residue, it is unusual because it has an unsaturated backbone.

==Structure and reactivity==
Like most primary enamines, dehydroalanine is unstable. Dehydroalanine hydrolyzes to pyruvate.

&quot;N&quot;-Acylated derivatives of dehydroalanine, such as peptides and related compounds, are stable. For example, methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate is the N-acetylated derivative of the ester. As a residue in a peptide, it is generated by a post translational modification. The required precursors are serine or cysteine residues, which undergo enzyme-mediated loss of water and hydrogen sulfide, respectively.

Most amino acid residues are unreactive toward nucleophiles, but those containing dehydroalanine or some other dehydroamino acids are exceptions. These are electrophilic due to the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, and can, for example, alkylate other amino acids. This activity has made DHA useful synthetically to prepare lanthionine.

==Occurrence==
The dehydroalanine residue was first detected in nisin, a cyclic peptide with antimicrobial activity. Dehydroalanine is also present in some lantibiotics and microcystins.

DHA can be formed from cysteine or serine by simple base catalysis without the need for an enzyme, which can happen during cooking and alkaline food preparation processes. It can then alkylate other amino acid residues, such as lysine, forming lysinoalanine cross-links and racemization of the original alanine. The resulting proteins have lower nutritional quality for some species but higher nutritional quality for others. Some lysinoalanines may also cause kidney enlargement in rats.

Many dehydroalanine-containing peptides are toxic.

A dehydroalanine residue was long thought to be an important electrophilic catalytic residue in histidine ammonia-lyase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzymes, but the active residue was later found instead to be a different unsaturated alanine derivative — 3,5-dihydro-5-methyldiene-4&quot;H&quot;-imidazol-4-one — that is even more electrophilic.

N-Acyl dehydroalanine derivatives have been synthesized by dehydration of serines using a &quot;tert&quot;-butoxycarbonate leaving group, or by conversion of Cysteine derivatives using various reagents for the elimination of the Thiol-group.

Newest methods allow the gram-scale synthesis of various protected dehydroamino acids by electrochemical oxidation of the respective amino acid derivative in methanol, followed by acid-catalyzed elimination of methanol.

<doc id="476248" wikidata="Q1364799" url="?curid=476248" title="Tian">
<text>Tian () is one of the oldest Chinese terms for heaven and a key concept in Chinese mythology, philosophy, and religion. During the Shang dynasty (17th―11th century BCE), the Chinese referred to their highest god as &quot;Shangdi&quot; or &quot;Di&quot; (, &#x27;Lord&#x27;). During the following Zhou dynasty, Tian became synonymous with this figure. Before the 20th century, worship of Tian was an orthodox state religion of China.

In Taoism and Confucianism, Tian (the celestial aspect of the cosmos, often translated as &quot;Heaven&quot;) is mentioned in relationship to its complementary aspect of &quot;Dì&quot; (, often translated as &quot;Earth&quot;). They are thought to maintain the two poles of the Three Realms of reality, with the middle realm occupied by Humanity (, ), and the lower world occupied by demons (, ) and &quot;ghosts&quot;, the damned, (, ). Tian was variously thought as a &quot;supreme power reigning over lesser gods and human beings&quot; that brought &quot;order and calm...or catastrophe and punishment&quot;, a deity, destiny, an impersonal force that controls events, a holy world or afterlife containing other worlds or afterlives, or one or more of these.

==Characters==
The modern Chinese character and early seal script both combine and , but some of the original characters in Shāng oracle bone script and Zhōu bronzeware script anthropomorphically portray a large head on a great person. The ancient oracle and bronze ideograms for depict a stick figure person with arms stretched out denoting &quot;great; large&quot;. The oracle and bronze characters for Tian emphasize the cranium of this &#x27;great (person)&#x27;, either with a square or round head, or head marked with one or two lines. Schuessler notes the bronze graphs for Tian, showing a person with a round head, resemble those for &quot;4th Celestial stem&quot;, and suggests &quot;The anthropomorphic graph may or may not indicate that the original meaning was &#x27;deity&#x27;, rather than &#x27;sky&#x27;.&quot;

Two variant Chinese characters for are (written with &#x27;two&#x27; and &#x27;human&#x27;) and the Daoist coinage (with &#x27;blue&#x27; and &#x27;qi&#x27;, cf. &#x27;blue sky&#x27;).

==Etymology==
Tian reconstructions in Middle Chinese (–10th centuries CE) include &quot;t&#x27;ien&quot;, &quot;t&#x27;iɛn&quot;, &quot;tʰɛn&quot; &gt; &quot;tʰian&quot;, and &quot;then&quot;. Reconstructions in Old Chinese (–3rd centuries BCE) include *&quot;t&#x27;ien&quot;, *&quot;t&#x27;en&quot;, *&quot;hlin&quot;, *&quot;thîn&quot;, and *&quot;l̥ˤin&quot;.

For the etymology of Tian, Schuessler links it with the Turkic and Mongolian word &quot;tengri&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27;, &#x27;heaven&#x27;, &#x27;deity&#x27; or the Tibeto-Burman words &quot;taleŋ&quot; (Adi) and &quot;tǎ-lyaŋ&quot; (Lepcha), both meaning &#x27;sky&#x27; or &#x27;God&#x27;. He also suggests a likely connection between Tian, &#x27;summit, mountaintop&#x27;, and &#x27;summit&#x27;, &#x27;top of the head&#x27;, &#x27;forehead&#x27;, which have cognates such as Zemeic Naga &quot;tiŋ&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27;. However, other reconstructions of &#x27;s OC pronunciation *&quot;qʰl&#x27;iːn&quot; or *&quot;l̥ˤi[n]&quot; reconstructed a voiceless lateral onset, either a cluster or a single consonant, respectively. Baxter &amp; Sagart pointed to attested dialectal differences in Eastern Han Chinese, the use of as a phonetic component in phono-semantic compound Chinese characters, and the choice of to transcribe foreign syllables, all of which prompted them to conclude that, around 200 CE, &#x27;s onset had two pronunciations: coronal *&quot;tʰ&quot; and dorsal *&quot;x&quot;, both of which likely originated from an earlier voiceless lateral *&quot;l̥ˤ&quot;. Further etymology is unknown. It is proposed that transcriptions of a Xiongnu word for &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;haak-lin&quot; , is related.

===Compounds===
Tian is one of the components in hundreds of Chinese compounds. Some significant ones include:
* Mandate of Heaven
*Heavenly Questions, a section of the &quot;Chu Ci&quot;.
* ( &#x27;Son of Heaven&#x27;), an honorific designation for the Emperor;
*All under heaven
* (, ) &#x27;the world; the universe&#x27;.
*Xingtian
* (, , a Chinese name for the Kaaba, from &quot;Bayt Allah&quot; ().

==Chinese interpretations==

&quot;Lord Heaven&quot; and &quot;Jade Emperor&quot; were terms for a supreme deity in Confucianism and Taoism who was an anthropromorphized Tian, and some conceptions of it thought of the names as synonymous.

Tian was viewed as &quot;the dwelling place of gods and other superhuman beings&quot;. It was also viewed as &quot;the guardian of both the moral laws of mankind and the physical laws of nature...and is synonymous with the divine will.&quot;

In Chinese culture, heaven tends to be &quot;synonymous with order&quot;, &quot;containing the blueprints for creation&quot;, &quot;the mandate by which earthly rulers govern, and the standards by which to measure beauty, goodness, and truth.&quot;

Zhou dynasty nobles made the worship of heaven a major part of their political philosophy and viewed it as &quot;many gods&quot; who embodied order and kingship, as well as the mandate of heaven.

=== Confucianism ===
&quot;Confucianism has a religious side with a deep reverence for Heaven and Earth (Di), whose powers regulate the flow of nature and influence human events.&quot; Yin and yang are also thought to be integral to this relationship and permeate both, as well as humans and man-made constructs. This &quot;cosmos&quot; and its &quot;principles&quot; is something that &quot;[t]he ways of man should conform to, or else&quot; frustration will result.

Many Confucianists, both historically and in current times, use the &quot;I Ching&quot; to divine events through the changes of Tian and other natural forces. Historical and current Confucianists were/are often environmentalists out of their respect for Heaven and the other aspects of nature and the principle that comes from their unity and, more generally, harmony as a whole, which is &quot;the basis for a sincere mind.&quot; The Emperor of China as &quot;Tianzi&quot; was formerly vital to Confucianism.

Mount Tai is seen as a sacred place in Confucianism and was traditionally the most revered place where Chinese emperors offered sacrifices to Heaven and Earth.

==== Confucius ====
The concept of Tian is pervasive in Confucianism. Confucius had a deep trust in Heaven and believed that Heaven overruled human efforts. He also believed that he was carrying out the will of Heaven, and that Heaven would not allow its servant, Confucius, to be dead until his work was done and complete. Many attributes of Heaven were delineated in his &quot;Analects&quot;.

Confucius honored Heaven as the supreme source of goodness:
The Master said, &quot;Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!&quot;
Confucius felt himself personally dependent upon Heaven: &quot;Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me! may Heaven reject me!&quot;

Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived:
 The Master being very ill, Zi Lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him. During a remission of his illness, he said, &quot;Long has the conduct of You been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven? Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?&quot; 

Confucius believed that Heaven gives people tasks to perform to teach them of virtues and morality:
The Master said, &quot;At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.&quot; 

He believed that Heaven knew what he was doing and approved of him, even though none of the rulers on earth might want him as a guide:
The Master said, &quot;Alas! there is no one that knows me.&quot; Zi Gong said, &quot;What do you mean by thus saying - that no one knows you?&quot; The Master replied, &quot;I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there is Heaven - that knows me!&quot; 

Perhaps the most remarkable saying, recorded twice, is one in which Confucius expresses complete trust in the overruling providence of Heaven:
The Master was put in fear in Kuang. He said, &quot;After the death of King Wen, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me? If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of Kuang do to me?&quot; 

===Mozi===
For Mozi, Heaven is the divine ruler, just as the Son of Heaven is the earthly ruler. Mozi believed that spirits and minor demons exist or at least rituals should be performed as if they did for social reasons, but their function is to carry out the will of Heaven, watching for evil-doers and punishing them. Mozi taught that Heaven loves all people equally and that each person should similarly love all human beings without distinguishing between his own relatives and those of others. Mozi criticized the Confucians of his own time for not following the teachings of Confucius. In Mozi&#x27;s &quot;Will of Heaven&quot; (), he writes:
Moreover, I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man&#x27;s good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people&#x27;s food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present.&quot;

===Schools of cosmology===
There are three major schools on the structure of Tian. Most other hypothesis were developed from them.
*&quot;Gaitian shuo&quot; () &quot;Canopy-Heavens hypothesis&quot; originated from the text Zhoubi Suanjing. The earth is covered by a material Tian.
*&quot;Huntian shuo&quot; () &quot;Egg-like hypothesis&quot;. The earth surrounded by a Tian sphere rotating over it. The celestial bodies are attached to the Tian sphere. (See , Chinese creation myth.)
*&quot;Xuanye shuo&quot; () &quot;Firmament hypothesis&quot;. The Tian is an infinite space. The celestial bodies were light matters floating on it moved by &quot;Qi&quot;. A summary by Ji Meng () is in the astronomical chapters of the Book of Jin.

Tian schools influenced popular conception of the universe and earth until the 17th century, when they were replaced by cosmological concepts imported from Europe.

Sometimes the sky is divided into &quot;Jiutian&quot; () &#x27;nine sky divisions&#x27;—the middle sky and the eight directions.

===Buddhism===
The Tian are the heaven worlds and pure lands in Buddhist cosmology.

Some devas are also called Tian.

===Taoism===
The number of vertical heaven layers in Taoism is different. A common belief in Taoism is that there were 36 Tian &quot;arranged on six levels&quot; that have &quot;different deities&quot;. The highest heaven is the &quot;Great Web&quot; which was sometimes said to be where Yuanshi Tianzun lived.

After death, some Taoists were thought to explore &quot;heavenly realms&quot; and/or become Taoist immortals. These immortals could be good or evil, and there were sometimes rivalries between them.

Some heavens in Taoism were thought to be evil, as in Shangqing Daoism, although Tian was mostly thought of as a force for good.

Heaven is sometimes seen as synonymous with the Dao or a natural energy that can be accessed by living in accordance with the Dao.

A Tao realm inconceivable and incomprehensible by normal humans and even Confucius and Confucianists was sometimes called &quot;the Heavens&quot;. Higher, spiritual versions of Daoists such as Laozi were thought to exist in there when they were alive and absorb &quot;the purest Yin and Yang&quot;, as well as &quot;xian&quot; who were reborn into it after their human selves&#x27; spirits were sent there. These spiritual versions were thought to be abstract beings that can manifest in that world as mythical beings such as dragons who eat yin and yang energy and ride clouds and their qi.

=== Chinese folk religion ===
Some Tian in Chinese folk religion were thought to be many different or a hierarchy of multiple, sphere-like realms that contained morally ambiguous creatures and spirits such as fox spirits and fire-breathing dragons.

The Tao realm was thought to exist by many ancient folk religion practitioners.

===Ahom religion===
Ahom religion ethnically originated from Dai people of Yunnan in Southwest China has a concept of Mong Phi (Heavenly Kingdom) which is often identified as Tian.

===Yiguandao===
In Yiguandao, Tian is divided into three vertical worlds. &quot;Li Tian&quot; () &#x27;heaven of truth&#x27;, &quot;Qi Tian&quot; () &#x27;heaven of spirit&#x27; and &quot;Xiang Tian&quot; () &#x27;heaven of matter&#x27;.

== Japanese interpretations ==
In some cases, the heavens in Shinto were thought to be a hierarchy of multiple, sphere-like realms that contained kami such as fox spirits&quot;.&quot;

Myths about the kami were told &quot;of their doings on Earth and in heaven.&quot; Heaven was thought to be a clean and orderly place for nature gods in Shinto.

==Interpretation by Western sinologists==
The sinologist Herrlee Creel, who wrote a comprehensive study called &quot;The Origin of the Deity T&#x27;ien&quot;, gives this overview.

Creel refers to the historical shift in ancient Chinese names for &#x27;god&#x27; from Shang oracles that frequently used &quot;Di&quot; and &quot;Shangdi&quot; and rarely used &quot;Tian&quot;, to Zhou bronzes and texts that used &quot;Tian&quot; more frequently than &quot;Shangdi&quot;. The chapter &quot;Tang Shi&quot; ( &#x27;Tang&#x27;s speech&#x27;) illustrates how early Zhou texts used Tian in contexts with &quot;Shangdi&quot;. According to tradition, Tang of Shang assembled his subjects to overthrow King Jie of Xia, the infamous last ruler of the Xia Dynasty, but they were reluctant to attack.

Having established that Tian was not a deity of the Shang people, Creel proposes a hypothesis for how it originated. Both the Shang and Zhou peoples pictographically represented &quot;da&quot; as &#x27;a large or great man&#x27;. The Zhou subsequently added a head on him to denote &quot;tian&quot; meaning &#x27;king, kings&#x27; (cf. &quot;wang&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;, &#x27;ruler&#x27;, which had oracle graphs picturing a line under a &#x27;great person&#x27; and bronze graphs that added the top line). From &#x27;king&#x27;, Tian was semantically extended to mean &#x27;dead kings&#x27;, &#x27;ancestral kings&#x27;, who controlled &#x27;fate; providence&#x27;, and ultimately a single omnipotent deity &quot;Tian&quot; &#x27;Heaven&#x27;. In addition, Tian named both &#x27;the heavens&#x27; (where ancestral kings and gods supposedly lived) and the visible &#x27;sky&#x27;.

Another possibility is that Tian may be related to Tengri, hinting at an ultimate origin as a loan word from a prehistoric Central Asian language that contributed to the creation of the word.

Kelly James Clark argued that Confucius himself saw Tian as an anthropomorphic god that Clark hypothetically refers to as &#x27;Heavenly Supreme Emperor&#x27;, although most other scholars on Confucianism disagree with this view.

<doc id="476251" wikidata="Q1724806" url="?curid=476251" title="Lantibiotics">
<text>Lantibiotics are a class of polycyclic peptide antibiotics that contain the characteristic thioether amino acids lanthionine or methyllanthionine, as well as the unsaturated amino acids dehydroalanine, and 2-aminoisobutyric acid. They belong to ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides.

Lanthionine is composed of two alanine residues that are crosslinked on their β-carbon atoms by a thioether (monosulfide) linkage.

Lantibiotics are produced by a large number of Gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptomyces&quot; to attack other Gram-positive bacteria, and as such, they are considered a member of the bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are classified according to their extent of posttranslational modification. The lantibiotics are a class of more extensively modified bacteriocins, also called Class I bacteriocins. (Bacteriocins for which disulfide bonds are the only modification to the peptide are Class II bacteriocins.)

Lantibiotics are well studied because of the commercial use of these bacteria in the food industry for making dairy products such as cheese.

Nisin and epidermin are members of a family of lantibiotics that bind to lipid II, a cell wall precursor lipid component of target bacteria and disrupt cell wall production. The duramycin family of lantibiotics binds phosphoethanolamine in the membranes of its target cells and seem to disrupt several physiological functions.

== History ==

The name lantibiotics was introduced in 1988 as an abbreviation for &quot;lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotics&quot;. The first structures of these antimicrobial agents were produced by pioneering work by Gross and Morell in the late 1960s and early 1970s, thus marking the formal introduction of lantibiotics. Since then, lantibiotics such as nisin have been used auspiciously for food preservation and have yet to encounter significant bacterial resistance. These attributes of lantibiotics have led to more detailed research into their structures and biosynthetic pathways.

== Classification ==

*Type A lantibiotics are long flexible molecules - e.g., nisin, bisin, subtilin, epidermin, gallidermin Subgroup AI includes mutacin II; subgroup AII includes mutacin I and III.
*Type B lantibiotics are globular - e.g., mersacidin. actagardine, duramycin, and cinnamycin.
Some contain 2 peptides, e.g. haloduracin.

=== Examples ===
(Sublancin may be an S-linked glycopeptide).

== Biosynthesis ==

They are synthesised with a leader polypeptide sequence that is removed only during the transport of the molecule out of the synthesising cell. They are synthesized by ribosomes, which distinguishes them from most natural antibiotics. There are four known enzymes (lanthipeptide synthetases) responsible for producing lanthionine rings.

== Mechanism of action ==

Lantibiotics show substantial specificity for some components (e.g., lipid II) of bacterial cell membranes especially of Gram-positive bacteria. Type A lantibiotics kill rapidly by pore formation, type B lantibiotics inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis. They are active in very low concentrations.

== Application ==

=== Food preservation ===

Lantibiotics are produced by Gram-positive bacteria and show strong antimicrobial action toward a wide range of other Gram-positive bacteria. As such, they have become attractive candidates for use in food preservation (by inhibiting pathogens that cause food spoilage) and the pharmaceutical industry (to prevent or fight infections in humans or animals).

=== Clinical antibiotic ===

One type known as B lantibiotic NVB302 entered phase 1 clinical trials in 2011 for use against &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, and reported good results in 2012.

== Databases ==

BACTIBASE is an open-access database for bacteriocins including lantibiotics. LANTIBASE is a lantibiotic specific resource.

<doc id="476255" wikidata="Q1595286" url="?curid=476255" title="Hong Kong Monetary Authority">
<text>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is the central banking institution of Hong Kong. It is a government authority founded on 1 April 1993 when the Office of the Exchange Fund and the Office of the Commissioner of Banking merged. The organisation reports directly to the Financial Secretary.

==Responsibilities==
The exchange fund was established and managed originally by the Currency Ordinance in 1935, now named the Exchange Fund Ordinance. Under the Ordinance, the HKMA&#x27;s primary objective is to ensure the stability of the Hong Kong currency and the banking system. It is also responsible for promoting the efficiency, integrity and development of the financial system.

The HKMA issues banknotes only in the denomination of ten Hong Kong dollars. The role of issuing other banknotes is delegated to the note-issuing banks in the territory, namely The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of China.

==Policies==
The official reserves of Hong Kong and the banking system are important underpinnings of the linked exchange rate system.

===Tools===
Since 1995, the HKMA has entered into a stability pact with central banks in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia to engage in repurchase agreements, which provide liquidity on a two-way basis.

==Infrastructure==

The Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), established in the 1990, provides computerised clearing and settlement facilities for Exchange Fund Bills and Notes. It extended the service to other Hong Kong dollar debt securities in late 1993. A seamless interface allow the co-existence of the CMU and the newly launched real-time gross settlement (RTGS) inter-bank payment system. This enables end-of-day delivery versus payment (DVP) services as opposed to Non-DVP.

In 2018, HKMA developed the infrastructure for the Faster Payment System and launched it in September of that year.

=== Banking licenses ===
Banking stability mainly depends on the banking system and supervision. A three-tier banking system () was implemented in the 1980s. Institutions are also managed differently depending on whether they are categorised as licensed banks, restricted license banks or deposit-taking institutions. Overseas banks may also establish local representative offices in Hong Kong.

In 2019, the HKMA began issuing the first batch of virtual bank licenses in Hong Kong; these banks were not required to have physical branches in the city.

==Monetary stability==

===Currency board system===
It is included the Linked Exchange Rate System and noticeable features such as the Aggregate Balance, Certificates of Indebtedness and coins issued and the Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes.

The Interest Rate Adjustment Mechanism is an automatic system that maintains the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. Lately the HKMA has been disclosing the forecast change in the Aggregate Balance attributes to increase the transparency of the Currency Board operation.

In 1995, Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton Friedman mistakenly predicted the Hong Kong dollar&#x27;s demise within two years of the 1997 handover. He also predicted the absorption of the territory&#x27;s financial reserves of billion (billion) by Beijing, which would not be able to bear the subrogation of Hong Kong&#x27;s monetary policy to the United States.

As with any monetary system not based on a fiat money (which includes currency boards, currency unions and the traditional gold standard) it is impossible to use monetary policy to stabilise the business cycle: this means that any macroeconomic adjustment has to be achieved by changes in the prices of assets and labour. In Hong Kong, this is made easier by two factors: the first is the openness of the economy, with an aggregate demand heavily dependent on international trading partners; this reduces the risk of classic liquidity traps. The second factor is the scarce political clout of the trade unions, which makes it easier to trim the nominal salaries during recessionary times. Moreover, the high saving rates and the moral stigma attached to bankruptcy have kept relatively low the level of defaults on mortgages even during the deep recessions after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003.

===Exchange fund===

Under colonial rule, the HKMA did not place funds with local banks not rated by Moody&#x27;s Investors Service or Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s. Only the three note-issuing banks could receive deposits because they had been rated by &quot;objective international standards&quot;.

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, currency speculators sold the Hong Kong dollar heavily and shorted local stocks and Hang Seng Index futures. The government controversially used the exchange fund to acquire billion (billion) worth of blue-chip shares in a two-week market intervention, beginning 12 August 1998 with the aim of punishing and deterring currency speculators. The intervention was widely criticised as being detrimental to Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation as one of the world&#x27;s financial centres. Democratic Party leader Martin Lee Chu-ming criticised the government for becoming &quot;a player, a very key player&quot; instead of being a regulator. Conversely, one speculator said in hindsight that the government&#x27;s intervention &quot;raised public confidence in the market when it was near total collapse&quot; and &quot;prevented a bigger crisis and saved the market&quot;. Most stocks acquired during that operation were successively disposed with the creation of a tracker fund, the TraHK. This reduced the portfolio of Hong Kong equities to 5.3% of the reserves in 2003. However, the percentage crept back and had risen above 10% by 2006.


In August 1998, as part of its wider remit to protect the currency, the HKMA lent the Thai government billion from the fund as part of a $17billion bailout organised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

==Headquarters==
The HKMA is headquartered in Tower 2 of the International Finance Centre. It purchased fourteen floors in Tower 2. The 55th, 56th, and the 77th to 88th floors were bought for million in 2001. An exhibition area currently containing an exhibit of Hong Kong&#x27;s monetary history, along with a library of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre, occupy the 55th floor. The 88th floor of the tower contains the office of the chief executive of the HKMA, and is served by an individual lift.

==Chief executive==
The Chief Executive is appointed for a five-year term by the Financial Secretary, and is continuously renewable with no term limit.

=== List of chief executives ===
=== Deputy chief executives ===
The chief executive is supported by a number of deputy chief executives, shown below in order of appointment.

# David Carse (1993–2003)
# Andrew Sheng (1993–1998)
# Norman Chan (1996–2005)
# Anthony Latter (1999–2003)
# William Ryback (2003–2007)
# Peter Pang (2004–2016)
# Choi Yiu-kwan (2005–2009)
# Eddie Yue (2007–2019)
# Arthur Yuen (since January 2010)
# Howard Lee (since February 2016)
# Edmond Lau (2021–2022)
# Darryl Chan (since November 2022)

==Events==
The HKMA hosted the meeting of the World Bank and IMF in 1997, at an estimated cost of million. Yam hoped that hosting the event would cement Hong Kong&#x27;s status as an international financial centre. He added, &quot;The presence of the world&#x27;s leading finance ministers, central bank governors and top commercial bankers in Hong Kong so soon after the change of sovereignty will help boost international and local confidence in Hong Kong&quot;.

The HKMA is also host to the 2022 Global Financial Leaders&#x27; Investment Summit.

<text>Microcystins—or cyanoginosins—are a class of toxins produced by certain cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae. Over 250 different microcystins have been discovered so far, of which microcystin-LR is the most common. Chemically they are cyclic heptapeptides produced through nonribosomal peptide synthases.

Cyanobacteria can produce microcystins in large quantities during algal blooms which then pose a major threat to drinking and irrigation water supplies, and the environment at large.

==Characteristics==

Microcystins—or cyanoginosins—are a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria; primarily &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; but also other &quot;Microcystis&quot;, as well as members of the &quot;Planktothrix&quot;, &quot;Anabaena&quot;, &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; and &quot;Nostoc&quot; genera.

Microcystin-LR (i.e. &quot;X&quot; = leucine, &quot;Z&quot; = arginine) is the most toxic form of over 80 known toxic variants, and is also the most studied by chemists, pharmacologists, biologists, and ecologists. Microcystin-containing &#x27;blooms&#x27; are a problem worldwide, including China, Brazil, Australia, South Africa, the United States and much of Europe. Hartebeespoort Dam in South Africa is one of the most contaminated sites in Africa, and possibly in the world.

== Chemistry ==
Microcystins have a common structural framework of D-Ala1-&quot;X&quot;2-3-&quot;Z&quot;4-Adda5-D-γ-Glu6-7, where &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are variable amino acids; the systematic name &quot;microcystin-&quot;XZ&quot;&quot; (MC-&quot;XZ&quot; in short) is then assigned based on the one letter codes (if available; longer codes otherwise) of the amino acids. If the molecule show any other modification, the differences are noted in square brackets before &quot;MC&quot;. Of these, several are uncommon non-proteinogenic amino acids:

* D-Masp is D-erythro-β-methyl-isoaspartic acid, a derivative of aspartic acid in β-amino acid form;
* Adda is (all-&quot;S&quot;,all-&quot;E&quot;)-3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid, a β-amino acid exclusively found in microcystin and the related nodularin;
* Mdha is N-methyldehydroalanine, a derivative of dehydroalanine. In nodularin it is replaced by Mdhb (N-methyldehydrobutyrine), another dehydroamino acid derivative.

== Mechanism of action ==
Microcystins covalently bond to and inhibit protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A and can thus cause pansteatitis. The ADDA residue is key to this functionality: greatly simplified synthetic analogues consisting of ADDA and one additional amino acid can show the same inhibiting function.

==Factors affecting production==

The microcystin-producing &quot;Microcystis&quot; is a genus of freshwater cyanobacteria and thrives in warm water conditions, especially in stagnant waters. The EPA predicted in 2013 that climate change and changing environmental conditions may lead to harmful algae growth and may negatively impact human health. Algal growth is also encouraged through the process of eutrophication (oversupply of nutrients). In particular, dissolved reactive phosphorus promotes algal growth.

Microcystins may have evolved as a way to deal with low iron supply in cyanobacteria: the molecule binds iron, and non-producing strains are significantly worse at coping with low iron levels. Low iron supply up-regulates &quot;McyD&quot;, one of the microcystin synthetic operons. Sufficient iron supply, however, can still boost microcystin production by making the bacterium better at photosynthesis, therefore producing sufficient ATP for MC biosynthesis.

Microcystin production is also positively correlated with temperature. Bright light and red light increases transcription of &quot;McyD&quot;, but blue light reduces it. A wide range of other factors such as pH may also affect MC production, but comparison is complicated due to a lack of standard testing conditions.

==Exposure pathways==
There are several ways of exposure to these hepatotoxins that humans can encounter one of which is through recreational activities like swimming, surfing, fishing, and other activities involving direct contact with contaminated water. Another rare, yet extremely toxic, route of exposure that has been identified by scientists is through hemodialysis surgeries. One of the fatal cases for microcystic intoxication through hemodialysis was studied in Brazil where 48% of patients that received the surgery in a specific period of time died because the water used in the procedure was found to be contaminated.

Microcystins are chemically stable over a wide range of temperature and pH, possibly as a result of their cyclic structure.
Microcystin-LR water contamination is resistant to boiling and microwave treatments.
Microcystin-producing bacteria algal blooms can overwhelm the filter capacities of water treatment plants. Some evidence shows the toxin can be transported by irrigation into the food chain.

===Lake Erie blooms===
In 2011, a record outbreak of blooming microcystis occurred in Lake Erie, in part related to the wettest spring on record, and expanded lake bottom dead zones, reduced fish populations, fouled beaches, and damaged the local tourism industry, which generates more than $10 billion in revenue annually.

In August 2014, the City of Toledo, Ohio detected unsafe levels of microcystin in its water supply due to harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, the shallowest of the Great Lakes. The city issued an advisory to approximately 500,000 people that the water was not safe for drinking or cooking. An Ohio state task force found that Lake Erie received more phosphorus than any other Great Lake, both from crop land, due to the farming practices, and from urban water-treatment centres.

===San Francisco Bay Area===
In 2016, microcystin had been found in San Francisco Bay Area shellfish in seawater, apparently from freshwater runoff, exacerbated by drought.

===Iowa===
In 2018, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources found microcystins at levels of 0.3 µg/L, or micrograms per liter (ppb), in the raw water supplies of 15 out of 26 public water systems tested.

=== Oregon ===
In 2023, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Oregon Health Authority issued a cyanobacteria advisory for much of the Willamette River as it runs through Portland. The advisory affected the Willamette from the Ross Island Lagoon through Cathedral Park. Testing by the DEQ showed microcystin levels at 549 ppb.

==Human health effects upon exposure==
Microcystins cannot be broken down by standard proteases like pepsin, trypsin, collagenase, and chymotrypsin due to their cyclic chemical nature. They are hepatotoxic, i.e., able to cause serious damage to the liver. Once ingested, microcystin travels to the liver via the bile acid transport system, where most is stored, though some remains in the blood stream and may contaminate tissue.
Acute health effects of Microcystin-LR are abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, diarrhea, headache, blistering around the mouth, and after inhalation sore throat, dry cough, and pneumonia.

Studies suggest that the absorption of microcystins occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, it was found that these hepatotoxins inhibit the activity of protein enzymes phosphatase PP1 and PP2A causing hemorrhagic shock and were found to kill within 45 minutes in mice studies.

There appears to be inadequate information to assess the carcinogenic potential of microcystins by applying EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. A few studies suggest a relationship may exist between liver and colorectral cancers and the occurrence of cyanobacteria in drinking water in China. Evidence is, however, limited due to limited ability to accurately assess and measure exposure.

==Regulation==
In the US, the EPA issued a health advisory in 2015. A ten day Health Advisory was calculated for different ages which is considered protective of non-carcinogenic adverse health effects over a ten-day exposure to microcystins in drinking water: 0.3 μg/L for bottle-fed infants and young children of pre-school age and 1.6 μg/L for children of school age through adults.

<text>HârnMaster is a fantasy role-playing game based in the fantasy world of Hârn. The system, like the world, was designed primarily by N. Robin Crossby.

==History==
&quot;Hârnmaster&quot; was published as a role-playing game using the Hârn setting by Columbia Games in 1986. All previously published &quot;Hârn&quot; supplements were intended to be system independent but Columbia gauged reader interest and decided to produce a game system specifically for the Hârn setting. N. Robin Crossby led the design and based the new game on notes for designs that he had saved from the 1970s. Columbia began to focus on supporting the &quot;Hârnmaster&quot; role-playing game rather than just the setting, and published their first ever Hârn adventures, &quot;100 Bushels of Rye&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Staff of Fanon&quot; (1988), and the rules supplement &quot;Pilots&#x27; Almanac&quot; (1988), followed books about magic and other supplements for the game. Columbia also resumed publication wargames including the Hârn miniatures wargame &quot;Battle Lust&quot; (1992), designed to be compatible with &quot;Hârnmaster&quot;. Columbia produced a few more adventures along with a second edition (1996) of &quot;Hârnmaster&quot; which was a simpler version of the game with the magic systems moved into the supplements &quot;Hârnmaster Magic&quot; (1997) and &quot;Hârnmaster Religion&quot; (1998), and the rulebooks &quot;Hârnmaster Manor&quot; (1999) and &quot;Hârnmaster Barbarians&quot; (2000) to finish the line. Crossby created his own version of the game, &quot;Hârnmaster Gold&quot; (1998), using rules that he intended to increase realism. When the d20 System came out, Columbia reprinted some of their setting material including &quot;Trobridge Inn&quot; (2001) and &quot;Evael: Kingdom of the Elves&quot; (2002) with dual game statistics for &quot;Hârnmaster&quot; and d20. Keléstia Productions began publication with the &quot;Hârnmaster Gold Player Edition&quot; (2003), and additional rule books afte that. Columbia began work on a more streamlined third edition of &quot;Hârnmaster&quot; (2003).

===Supplements===
Additional supplements were published for the game, including &quot;Tome of the Ancient and Esoteric Mysteries of the Powers of Peleahn&quot; (1989).

==Description==
There are now multiple versions of HârnMaster available through the original publishers and through various third-party vendors. Each version has different strengths:

HârnMaster was originally published in 1986 by Columbia Games and is out of print. The third edition of HârnMaster, is the latest and was released in 2002 by Columbia Games.

HârnMaster Core Rules was published by Columbia Games and later supplemented by HârnMaster Religion, HârnMaster Magic, HârnMaster Barbarians, and HârnManor (a set of rules for developing consistent medieval manors for use as role-playing settings or as settings for collaborative fiction).

HârnMaster Core was seen by some as an oversimplification of the original. Some fans appreciated the change as it made play move faster at the expense of realism. Others preferred the realism of the original. Original author N. Robin Crossby responded with the even more detailed HârnMaster Gold.

HârnMaster Gold Player&#x27;s Edition and GM&#x27;s Edition are published by Kelestia Productions and is known for exceptional realism. It is best suited for a realist style of play, and is not well-suited for those who prefer a fast-paced game.

Many players wanted a still faster, better-balanced game with more social options for characters. Columbia Games HârnMaster 3rd Edition fixed many of the difficulties of the Core Rules while remaining compatible with the Magic, Religion, and other expansions. It is suited for a faster-paced game than HârnMaster Gold. 

In addition to the multiple versions of HârnMaster published by Kelestia Productions and Columbia Games, there are numerous house rules available through the dedicated fan community.

==Rules==
Hârnmaster characters are described primarily by their attributes and skills. Attributes are initially generated in the range of 3-18 and may be modified by race, background, gender, or medical conditions. Compared to many other games, Hârnmaster has a very large and detailed set of attributes. In addition to the common qualities of Strength, Stamina, and Intelligence, etc., Hârnmaster attributes independently measure a character&#x27;s eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell, his physical attractiveness (to a member of the same species), both manual and bodily dexterity, willpower, and psychic strength. In addition to these basic attributes, a number of derived attributes (such as Endurance, derived from Strength, Stamina, and Will) are used to describe a character&#x27;s basic qualities and abilities.

Attributes are also used as a basis for the skill system, which is the core mechanism for combat and non-combat task resolution. The Hârnmaster system provides no character classes, instead using a character&#x27;s background (which is generated in great detail) to determine his initial skills. A character generally begins play with several sets of skills:
* Automatic skills, which any character can attempt to use without training. This includes common tasks such as climbing and jumping, common knowledge, and basic social skills.
* Family skills, determined by the player character&#x27;s family background. Characters are assumed to have worked in the occupation of their parent (or other guardian) until the age of 10-12, and have basic skills in these occupations.
* Occupational skills, derived from the character&#x27;s employment. These skills can be entirely distinct from family skills (if the character did not follow his parents&#x27; occupation), or can be an improvement to the family skills that were already gained (someone who was raised by fishermen begins play as a better fisherman than one who was raised by woodcarvers).
* Optional militia skills, which can represent rudimentary combat training for a character whose primary occupation is not combat related.

Each skill is improved independently, in response to use in play or to study and training. There are no theoretical limitations on what skills a character can learn; a priest or wizard is free to learn combat skills of any type, and a knight or soldier is free to focus on knowledge skills or stealth and thievery. In practice, skill acquisition and advancement can be limited by in-game circumstances, such as the availability of a teacher or social norms (non-noble characters, for instance, are prohibited from owning certain weapons- making it difficult for non-noble characters to attain proficiency with these weapons).

While attributes are rated on a 3-18 scale, skills are rated from 1-95 and attempts to use skills are resolved with a 1d100 roll. Attributes are tested directly by multiplying the attribute by a number between 1 and 5 (depending on the difficulty of the task), and rolling a 1d100. Penalties to skill or attribute checks- due to fatigue, injury, encumbrance, or other circumstances- decrease the &#x27;target&#x27; number that the player must roll under in order to succeed. Successes or failures by rolls that end in 5 are considered to be Critical Success or Critical Failure; other successes and failures are rated as Marginal. Conflicts between two characters- such as combat- are resolved by cross referencing the degrees of success and failure of each party on a chart. For example, in combat, a Critical Success for an attacker combined with Critical Failure for a defender would mean that a particularly fierce blow had been struck. Critical Success for a defender and Critical Failure for the attacker might indicate that not only had a blow been blocked or dodged, but that the attacker may have been thrown off balance, disarmed, or put at a tactical disadvantage. More moderate results would result in more modest successes for one party, or a temporary stalemate.

In combat, each injury is tracked individually, rather than subtracting from a pool of Hit Points or Life Points. More serious injuries introduce the risk of a character being knocked unconscious from shock, being instantly killed, or (optionally) losing a limb. A character may also be killed or knocked unconscious by blood loss or a combination of lesser injuries. Unhealed injuries penalize a characters actions, including combat actions, reducing their overall effectiveness. Each injury heals at a different rate, depending on its severity, and open wounds have the potential to become infected, slowing healing and possibly causing death. Permanent injuries- either in the form of amputated or otherwise lost limbs- or attribute penalties caused by poorly-healed injuries are also a possibility. The combat and injury system is quite lethal, compared to many roleplaying systems. Even for veteran characters, combat with a skilled opponent or a sneak attack by an opponent armed with a modest weapon can lead to death in a single strike; an unarmed blow to the neck or a bowshot to the eye can be fatal.

The magic system is based around six elemental principles: Lyahvi (Air/Light/Illusion), Peleahn (Fire), Jmorvi (Metal/Artifice), Fyrvia (Life/Growth/Decay), Odivshe (Water/Cold), and Savorya (Mind/Spirit/Knowledge). The principles are arranged in a wheel, with Lyahvi being opposed to Fyrvia, Peleahn to Odivshe, and Jmorvi to Savorya. Mages, known as &quot;Shek-Pvar,&quot; begin their careers attuned to one of the elements, and are said to be in that elemental &quot;convocation&quot;. Spells are learned as skills, with substantial bonuses for spells in one&#x27;s own convocation, substantial penalties for spells in the opposing convocation, and smaller effects for the other convocations; there are also &quot;neutral&quot; spells which are not part of any convocation, and &quot;common&quot; spells for which a version exists in each convocation. Eventually a mage can become a &quot;grey mage&quot;, losing both the penalties and bonuses based on spells&#x27; elemental alignment. The system also has rules for researching and learning new spells as well as creating spells &quot;on the fly&quot; (usually with a large chance of failure).

Characters track a piety level with their patron deity, if any (Hârn has ten well-detailed major deities and a larger number of lesser ones). Characters with high piety scores and proper priestly training may then petition their deity for miracles appropriate to the deity&#x27;s nature (healing, divination, sustenance, etc.).

There are also rules for psionic abilities (telepathy, telekinesis, precognition, etc.) which are handled in the same way as other skills.

==Reception==
In Issue 6 of &quot;The Games Machine&quot; (May 1988), John Woods was pleased by the quality of &quot;Harnmaster&quot;, commenting that &quot;The layout of the book has a business-like feel that suits the style of the rules well.&quot; He liked the open-ended feel of the character generation rules, and thought the &quot;complex but understandable&quot; combat system &quot;is the most thorough and realistic fantasy combat system I’ve seen.&quot; He admitted that its complexity would slow play down somewhat, but he pointed out that the gruesomely realistic consequences of combat wounds would force most players &quot;to avoid combat wherever possible - a very satisfactory situation. Too many GMs and players rely on monster-bashing to the exclusion of role-playing, and it is good to see a system that encourages the opposite trend.&quot; He recommended this for players willing to put in the time and effort to learn it well, saying, &quot;&quot;Harnmaster&quot; is a system for the purist. Whilst the rules are exceedingly clearly written throughout, they will take time and effort to master, and compared to simpler systems will always require more work and thought from players and GMs alike in play.&quot; He concluded, &quot;If you enjoy realism in role-playing, give &quot;Harnmaster&quot; a try.&quot;

In the March 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue #3), Jake Thornton questioned why this game had not achieved the same level of market saturation as some other role-playing games, since he believed that it did just as good a job of outlining its mechanics. He did admit that the magic system was rather unexciting, but commented that &quot;Happily the mechanics for combat are more interesting.&quot; He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying, &quot;&quot;Harnmaster&quot; is not a particularly innovative game, relying in general on tried and trusted ideas. Despite this, the clarity of writing and layout together with the sheer volume of ready made background and support material must make it an attractive alternative for those who like a wealth of detail but haven&#x27;t got the time themselves.&quot; 

In the October 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Ken Rolston reviewed both &quot;HârnMaster&quot; and its first supplementary adventure, &quot;Araka-Kalai&quot;, published in 1987. Rolston called &quot;HârnMaster&quot; &quot;a comprehensive, logical, authentic &#x27;medieval&#x27; fantasy campaign setting [with] epic scale and original concept&quot;; he considered it &quot;state of the art&quot; compared to all other major competitors. Rolston&#x27;s only criticism &quot;was the absence of published examples of adventures&quot;, apparently &quot;perceived as a virtue by Columbia Games.&quot; In considering the adventure &quot;Araka-Kalai&quot;, Rolston commented that &quot;The graphics are excellent, with color maps, abundant diagrams of locations and buildings, and appropriate, expressive illustrations of scenes, characters, and creatures. The style of presentation is clear and detailed, and is dry with an occasional droll impulse. It is well organized for reading and reference. And the campaign materials — well, they’re voluminous, historically and socially plausible, and full of dramatic fantasy adventure and thematic hooks.&quot; He felt the setting was so original that it was &quot;more distinguished as a campaign setting than an adventure supplement&quot; and gave it a thumbs up, saying, &quot;This is a strongly recommended adventure setting.&quot;

In Issue 13 of &quot;Arcane&quot; (December 1996), Andy Butcher reviewed the second edition of &quot;Harmaster&quot;, and thought the streamlining of the rules, with complexities shunted off into an &quot;optional rules&quot; section made the game &quot;easier to learn and understand, it gives referees the chance to customise the level of detail used in their games.&quot; Butcher also liked the new three-ring binder format, allowing future additions to be added to various parts of the binder. However, Butcher still felt the Harnmaster system&#x27;s weakness was the lack of religion and magic, saying, &quot;It would have been better to drop the psionic rules and campaign background sections and at least present the basics of the magic and religion rules.&quot; He concluded by giving the second edition of &quot;Harnmaster&quot; a below-average rating 6 out of 10, commenting, &quot;A detailed fantasy system that&#x27;s logically structured and well designed. Unfortunately, the presentation and high quality of the writing and design don&#x27;t quite make up for the lack of rules for magic and religion. If you want to run a historically based &#x27;low fantasy&#x27; campaign, though, it could be what you&#x27;re looking for.&quot;

<text>Lucy Terry Prince, often credited as simply Lucy Terry (c. 1733–1821), was an American settler and poet. Kidnapped in Africa and enslaved, she was taken to the British colony of Rhode Island. Her future husband purchased her freedom before their marriage in 1756. She composed a ballad poem, &quot;Bars Fight&quot;, about a 1746 incident in which two white families were attacked by Native Americans. It was preserved orally until it was published in 1855. It is considered the oldest known work of literature by an African American.

==Early life==
Terry was born in c. 1733 on the African continent. She was abducted from there and sold into slavery in Rhode Island as an infant in about 1733. She lived in Rhode Island until the age of five, when she was sold to Ebenezer Wells of Deerfield, Massachusetts, who allowed the five-year-old Terry to be baptized into the Christian faith during the Great Awakening.

In 1756, Lucy married Abijah Prince, a successful free Black man from Curaçao, who had purchased her freedom. They were married by justice of the peace Elijah Williams. In 1764, the Princes settled in Guilford, Vermont, where all six children were born. They were Tatnai, Cesar, Drucilla, Durexa, Abijah Jr., and Festus. Cesar fought in the American Revolutionary War.

==Poetry==
Terry&#x27;s work &quot;Bars Fight&quot;, composed in 1746, is a ballad about an attack upon two white families by Native Americans on August 25, 1746. This poem is part of the American captivity narrative genre. The attack occurred in an area of Deerfield called &quot;The Bars&quot;, which was a colonial term for a meadow. The poem was preserved orally until 1855, when it was published in Josiah Gilbert Holland&#x27;s &quot;History of Western Massachusetts&quot;. This poem is the only surviving work by Terry. However, she was famous in her own time for her &quot;rhymes and stories&quot;.

Terry&#x27;s work is considered the oldest known work of literature by an African American, though Phillis Wheatley&#x27;s, &quot;Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral&quot;, printed in 1773, was the first published work by an African American.

==Farm sabotage and oral arguments==
Lucy Terry Prince and Abijah Prince became prominent and prosperous smallholders in Guilford, Vermont but were eventually ruined by a dispute started by their neighbor John Noyes, a Connecticut man from a slaveholding family, who referred to Lucy&#x27;s husband as &quot;Abijah Negro.&quot; Noyes and various men he had hired damaged the Princes&#x27; farm and filed frivolous lawsuits against them. The Princes won every lawsuit but failed to end the feud. After a particularly fateful incident, the Princes retained the services of Samuel Knight, a prominent jurist of the era. In 1785, Lucy successfully pled her case before the Governor of Vermont, who found that she had been &quot;much injured&quot; by the Noyes who were &quot;greatly oppressing&quot; her and her husband. Soon afterward, a mob assembled by Noyes invaded the Princes&#x27; farm in the middle of the night, beat a black farmhand nearly to death, burned crops, and left the household in ruins. The state of Vermont prosecuted the mob and sentenced them to prison. Noyes bailed out his henchmen, was not himself prosecuted, and served as a state legislator in Vermont for over a decade.

In 1803, Lucy, now destitute, returned to the Vermont Supreme Court to argue on behalf of her sons against false land claims made against them by Colonel Eli Brownson. She was awarded a sum of $200. She was the first woman to argue before the high court, holding her own against two of the leading lawyers in the state, one of whom later became Chief Justice.

In 1806, after months of petitioning, Lucy convinced the town selectmen of Sunderland, Vermont to purchase an additional $200 (~$ in ) of land from Brownson for her use, to provide for her family.

Lucy reportedly delivered a three-hour address to the board of trustees of Williams College while trying to gain admittance for her son Festus. She was unsuccessful, and Festus was reportedly denied entry on account of the school&#x27;s racist admission policies. This oral history was recorded at the time of Lucy&#x27;s death by a resident, who also reported that Lucy remained popular in her hometown until her old age and that young boys would often come to her home to hear her talk.

== Death ==
Prince&#x27;s husband died in 1794. By 1803, Prince had moved to nearby Sunderland. She rode on horseback annually to visit her husband&#x27;s grave until she died in 1821.

The following obituary was published for Prince on Tuesday, August 21, 1821, in the Greenfield, Massachusetts, paper &quot;The Frankylin Herald&quot;:
At Sunderland, Vt., July 11th, Mrs. Lucy Prince, a woman of colour. From the church and town records where she formerly resided, we learn that she was brought from Bristol, Rhode Island, to Deerfield, Mass. when she was four years old, by Mr. Ebenezer Wells: that she was 97 years of age—that she was early devoted to God in Baptism: that she united with the church in Deerfield in 1744—Was married to Abijah Prince, May 17th, 1756, by Elijah Williams, Esq. and that she had been the mother of six children. In this remarkable woman there was an assemblage of qualities rarely to be found among her sex. Her volubility was exceeded by none, and in general, the fluency of her speech was not destitute of instruction and education. She was much respected among her acquaintances, who treated her with deference.
The Prince family was remembered in Guilford for many decades after their death. John Noyes&#x27; daughter was once startled off a horse by the sight of their ghosts, and ghost sightings on their farm have been reported even into the 21st century.

==Historical record==
Only a single letter in Abijah&#x27;s handwriting and none in Lucy&#x27;s has survived. Because the shopkeeper&#x27;s records show that the household sometimes purchased paper, it is suspected that Lucy wrote other literary works, which were eventually lost during the attacks on her household and declining fortune.

<text>Ernst Ferdinand Sauerbruch (; 3 July 1875 – 2 July 1951) was a German surgeon. His major work was on the use of negative-pressure chambers for surgery.

== Biography ==
Sauerbruch was born in Barmen (now a district of Wuppertal), Germany. He studied medicine at the Philipps University of Marburg, the University of Greifswald, the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, and the University of Leipzig, from the last of which he graduated in 1902. He went to Breslau in 1903, where he developed the Sauerbruch chamber, a pressure chamber for operating on the open thorax, which he demonstrated in 1904. This invention was a breakthrough in thorax medicine and allowed heart and lung operations to take place at greatly reduced risk. As a battlefield surgeon during World War I, he developed several new types of limb prostheses, which for the first time enabled simple movements to be executed with the remaining muscle of the patient.

Sauerbruch worked at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1918 to 1927 on surgical techniques and diets for treating tuberculosis. From 1928 to 1949, he was the head of the surgical department at the Charité in Berlin, attaining international fame for his innovative operations. Because of his experience and extraordinary skills, he quickly attained an international reputation and operated on many prominent patients. At the same time, he was well known for his uncompromising and passionate dedication to all patients independent of their social, political or ethnic backgrounds. 

Before World War II, the German Government awarded Sauerbruch the German National Prize for Art and Science. Sauerbruch&#x27;s position towards the Nazi government is still the subject of debate. In his position, he was clearly in contact with the political elite but he was never a member of the NSDAP. However, he did support the political objectives of the NSDAP and encouraged other scientists to join it. In 1935, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed him to the Prussian State Council, and he remained a member through the end of the Nazi regime. He was a fervent nationalist who wanted to undo the &quot;humiliation of Versailles&quot; and was keen to show off his country as an advanced and sophisticated society. While he had accepted the &quot;German Nationalpreis&quot;, a short-lived German alternative to the Nobel Prize, it is said he also publicly spoke out for people who were persecuted (e.g. the Impressionist painter Max Liebermann). He was part of the so-called &quot;Mittwochsgesellschaft&quot; (de) (Wednesday Society), a group of scientists that included critical voices; and after 20 July 1944 he was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo because his son Peter had ties to Claus von Stauffenberg.

In 1937, he became a member of the newly established Reich Research Council that supported &quot;research projects&quot; of the SS, including experiments on prisoners in the concentration camps. As head of the General Medicine Branch of the RRC, it was alleged that he personally approved the funds which financed August Hirt&#x27;s experiments with mustard gas on prisoners at Natzweiler concentration camp from 1941 until 1944. However, he was one of the few university professors who publicly spoke out against the NS-Euthanasia program T4. In 1942, he became Surgeon General to the army. In mid-September 1943, Sauerbruch was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the War Merit Cross with Swords. On 12 October 1945, he was charged by the Allies for having contributed to the Nazi dictatorship, but acquitted for lack of evidence.

Sauerbruch continued hospital surgery throughout the whole war; his operating theatre was taken by the Red Army in 1945. Late in life, he developed dementia and was dismissed from the Charité because he continued to perform surgeries on patients, some with uncertain results. His colleagues detected the errors but were unable to stop him because of his fame and power.

Sauerbruch died in East Berlin at the age of seventy-five. He is buried at Wannsee. A high school in Grossröhrsdorf in Saxony in modern Germany bears his name.

Portrayals in Media

Sauerbruch&#x27;s life was portrayed in the German 1954 film &quot;Sauerbruch – Das war mein Leben&quot;, which is based on his memoirs &quot;Das war mein Leben&quot; (This Was My Life), although the validity of these memoirs (written by the journalist Hans Rudolf Berndorff) is contested by Sauerbruch&#x27;s disciple Rudolf Nissen.

The second series of the German series &quot;Charité at War (TV series)&quot; depicts the workings of the Charité under Sauerbruch&#x27;s leadership during World War II and the impact of the contemporary political climate on the hospital staff.

== Children ==
His eldest son Hans Sauerbruch (1910–1996) became a painter; he lived in Berlin, Rome and after the war in Konstanz where his son, the architect Matthias Sauerbruch, was born.

Sauerbruch&#x27;s second son, Friedrich Sauerbruch (born 1911), was a surgeon as well. He assisted his father and was actually responsible for the termination of his father&#x27;s activities at the Charité (which had become too risky due to his illness). He lived in Berlin and later in Moers.

The third son Peter Sauerbruch (5 June 1913 – 29 September 2010) was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 4 January 1943 as a Hauptmann in the general staff of the 14th Panzer Division and leader of a Kampfgruppe &quot;Sauerbruch&quot;. He lived in Hamburg and Munich.

<doc id="476292" wikidata="Q603260" url="?curid=476292" title="Three Character Classic">
<text>The Three Character Classic (), commonly known as San Zi Jing, also translated as Trimetric Classic, is one of the Chinese classic texts. It was probably written in the 13th century and is mainly attributed to Wang Yinglin (王應麟, 1223–1296) during the Song dynasty. It is also attributed to Ou Shizi (1234–1324).

The work is not one of the traditional six Confucian classics, but rather the embodiment of Confucianism suitable for teaching young children. Until the latter part of the 1800s, it served as a child&#x27;s first formal education at home. The text is written in triplets of characters for easy memorization. With illiteracy common for most people at the time, the oral tradition of reciting the classic ensured its popularity and survival through the centuries. With the short and simple text arranged in three-character verses, children learned many common characters, grammar structures, elements of Chinese history and the basis of Confucian morality, especially filial piety and respect for elders (the Five Relationships in Chinese society).

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; formed the basis of elementary education, along with &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; and &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;. The group came to be known as &quot;San Bai Qian&quot; (Three, Hundred, Thousand), from the first character in their titles. They were the almost universal introductory literacy texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers. Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, they could recognize and pronounce, though not necessarily write or understand the meaning of, roughly 2,000 characters (there was some duplication among the texts). Since Chinese did not use an alphabet, this was an effective, though time-consuming, way of giving a &quot;crash course&quot; in character recognition before going on to understanding texts and writing characters.

The text fell into disuse during the Cultural Revolution given the state&#x27;s opposition to non-socialist ideologies. The classic, however, continued to circulate in other parts of the Chinese-speaking world with its inclusion in the &quot;Chinese Almanac&quot; (通勝) along with several other classics such as the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;.

The first four verses state the core &quot;credo&quot; of Confucianism, that is, that human nature is inherently good, as developed by Mencius, considered one of the most influential traditional Chinese philosophers after Confucius.

::::::人之初 (&quot;rén zhī chū&quot;) People at birth,
::::::性本善 (&quot;xìng běn shàn&quot;) Are naturally good (kind-hearted).
::::::性相近 (&quot;xìng xiāng jìn&quot;) Their natures are similar,
::::::習相遠 (&quot;xí xiāng yuǎn&quot;) (But) their habits make them different (from each other).

Even nowadays, the above two introductory quotes are very familiar to most youth in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if not known by heart. Though the work is no longer taught at public schools (it is still taught in Beijing today if not in all schools), some parents still use this classic to teach their young children to pronounce Chinese characters. It is sometimes a game for elementary school children to show off who can recite the most sentences from this classic.

==Editions==
The &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; was translated in 1796 into Manchu as (Wylie: Manchu nikan ghergen i kamtsime sughe San tsz&#x27; ging pitghe; Möllendorff: Manju nikan hergen-i kamcime suhe San ze ging ni bithe).

The most well-known English translation of the text was completed by Herbert Giles in 1900 and revised in 1910. The translation was based on the original Song dynasty version. Giles had published an earlier translation (Shanghai 1873) but he rejected that and other early translations as inaccurate. Earlier translations into English include those by Robert Morrison, 1812; Solomon Caesar Malan and Hung Hsiu-chʻüan, 1856, and Stanislas Julien, 1864.

A &quot;Christian Three Character Classic&quot; (Chinese: 新增三字經; Pinyin: Xīnzēng Sānzì Jīng) by Walter Henry Medhurst was first published in 1823 as an aid to missionary education. The three-character rhyming format was retained but the content was completely different.

=== Vietnam ===

The earliest recorded date that the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; was introduced to Vietnam is around 1820-1830 according to primary sources at the time. From there, it was circulated and modified. Different variants of the text began to emerge. The texts would either have different characters used, new lines, or different ordering. The most common variant of the &quot;Three Character Classic&quot; in Vietnam has 30 lines that are different from the Chinese edition. There are also two lines in the Vietnamese version that do not exist in the Chinese version.
The two lines were added to form a full sequence of numbers (Chinese version begins from three to ten). 

* One (nhất thái cực 一太極)
* Two (nhị âm dương 二陰陽)
* Three (tam tài 三才, tam quang 三光, tam cương 三綱)
* Four (tứ thời 四時, tứ phương 四方)
* Five (ngũ hành 五行, ngũ thường 五常)
* Six (lục cốc 六穀, lục súc 六畜)
* Seven (thất tình 七情)
* Eight (bát âm 八音)
* Nine (cửu tộc 九族)
* Ten (thập nghĩa 十義)

The text was also translated into vernacular Vietnamese, with the books such as Tam tự giải âm 三字解音, Tam tự kinh diễn âm 三字經演音, Tam tự kinh giải âm diễn ca 三字經解音演歌, Tam tự kinh thích nghiã 三字經釋義, and Tam tự kinh lục bát diễn âm 三字經六八演音 having chữ Nôm characters annotating the original text.

=== Differences in Chinese texts ===
The following stanzas do not appear in the Giles translation and originally appeared in Simplified Chinese. They list the dynasties that followed the Song dynasty up to and including the founding of Republican China. These stanzas were probably added cumulatively sometime between late 13th century and after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949.
¹ this line replaces the original one in the Song version where it says &quot;The Seventeen Dynastic Histories... 十七史...&quot;.

== Reception ==
The first two lines were recited at the Academy Awards 2021 by Chloé Zhao, the award winner for best director.

<doc id="476297" wikidata="Q240256" url="?curid=476297" title="Ahmose (queen)">
<text>Ahmose was an Ancient Egyptian queen in the Eighteenth Dynasty. She was the Great Royal Wife of the dynasty&#x27;s third pharaoh, Thutmose I, and the mother of the queen and pharaoh Hatshepsut. Her name means &quot;Born of the Moon&quot;.

==Family==

It is not known who Ahmose&#x27;s father and mother were. It has been suggested that Ahmose was either a daughter of pharaoh Amenhotep I or a daughter of pharaoh Ahmose I and possibly Ahmose I&#x27;s sister-wife Ahmose-Nefertari. Ahmose was never called a &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. This fact creates some doubt about these theories about Ahmose&#x27;s royal family connections. However, Ahmose did hold the title &quot;King&#x27;s Sister&quot;. This may suggest that she was a sister of Pharaoh Thutmose I.

Ahmose is identified with an impressive array of titles: &quot;Hereditary Princess&quot; (iryt-p`t), &quot;Great of Praises&quot; (wrt-hzwt), &quot;Mistress of Great Beloved Sweetness&quot; (nebt-bnrt-‘3(t)-mrwt), &quot;Great King’s Wife, his beloved&quot; (hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f), &quot;Mistress of Gladness&quot; (hnwt-ndjm-ib), &quot;Lady of all Women&quot; (hnwt-hmwt-nbwt), &quot;Mistress of the Two Lands&quot; (hnwt-t3wy), &quot;Companion of Horus&quot; (zm3yt-hrw), &quot;Beloved Companion of Horus&quot; (zm3yt-hrw-mryt.f), &quot;King’s Sister&quot; (snt-niswt)

Ahmose was the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose I. She is depicted in Deir-el-Bahari and she appears there with a daughter named Neferubity. Ahmose was also the mother of the queen-pharaoh Hatshepsut. It is not known with certainty whether Princes Amenmose and Wadjmose were her sons. They are generally thought to be the sons of Queen Mutnofret, another wife of Thutmose I.

==Monuments and inscriptions==
An official named Yuf served as the second prophet of the dues (&quot;S&#x27;w&quot;) of the altar, the doorkeeper of the temple, and as a priest. He also served several royal women. He first served queen Ahhotep, the mother of pharaoh Ahmose I, he was responsible for repairing the disturbed tomb of Queen Sobekemsaf, and eventually served Queen Ahmose. Yuf recorded that Queen Ahmose appointed him as assistant treasurer and entrusted him with the service to a statue of her majesty

Ahmose features prominently in the divine conception scenes. Hatshepsut had scenes created showing how the god Amun approached her mother, Ahmose, and how she (Hatshepsut) was of divine birth. The inscriptions show how the god Thoth first mentions Queen Ahmose to Amun. &quot;Ahmose is her name, the beneficent, mistress of [--], She is the wife of the king Aakheperkare (Thutmose I), given life forever&quot; (from Breasted&#x27;s Ancient Records). The god Amun then proceeds to the palace and makes himself known to the Queen. They proceed to conceive a child and Amun declares that she should be named Khnemet-Amun-Hatshepsut. Amun proceeds to the god Khnum and instructs him to create Hatshepsut. The scenes continue to show the confinement of the queen and the birth of her divine daughter.

Many years later Pharaoh Amenhotep III copied these scenes almost exactly to show how Amun visited his mother, Queen Mutemwiya, and conceived the royal prince.

Events
* 14 May — Jack Johnson is convicted in Chicago of violating the 1910 Mann Act and is subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day plus a fine of $1,000. In June, while still free with an appeal pending, Johnson flees the United States and does not return until July 1920. Johnson is the first person to be prosecuted under the Act, which prohibits so-called white slavery including the interstate transport of females for &quot;immoral purposes&quot;. Johnson has had affairs with white prostitutes who have travelled with him to other states. In Johnson&#x27;s case, it is held that the authorities are using the Act&#x27;s ambiguous language to justify a selective prosecution which amounts to harassment, based on their desire to deprive him of his title for racist reasons. Johnson retains the title for another two years.

<doc id="476310" wikidata="Q2026337" url="?curid=476310" title="MirOS BSD">
<text>MirOS BSD (originally called MirBSD) is a free and open source operating system which started as a fork of OpenBSD 3.1 in August 2002. It was intended to maintain the security of OpenBSD with better support for European localisation. Since then it has also incorporated code from other free BSD descendants, including NetBSD, MicroBSD and FreeBSD. Code from MirOS BSD was also incorporated into ekkoBSD, and when ekkoBSD ceased to exist, artwork, code and developers ended up working on MirOS BSD for a while.

Unlike the three major BSD distributions, MirOS BSD supports only the x86 and SPARC architectures.

One of the project&#x27;s goals was to be able to port the MirOS userland to run on the Linux kernel, hence the deprecation of the MirBSD name in favour of MirOS.

== History ==
MirOS BSD originated as &quot;OpenBSD-current-mirabilos&quot;, an OpenBSD patchkit, but soon grew on its own after some differences in opinion between the OpenBSD project leader Theo de Raadt and Thorsten Glaser. Despite the forking, MirOS BSD was synchronised with the ongoing development of OpenBSD, thus inheriting most of its good security history, as well as NetBSD and other BSD flavours.

One goal was to provide a faster integration cycle for new features and software than OpenBSD. According to the developers, &quot;controversial decisions are often made differently from OpenBSD; for instance, there won&#x27;t be any support for SMP in MirOS&quot;. There will also be a more tolerant software inclusion policy, and &quot;the end result is, hopefully, a more refined BSD experience&quot;.

Another goal of MirOS BSD was to create a more &quot;modular&quot; base BSD system, similar to Debian. While &quot;MirOS Linux&quot; (linux kernel + BSD userland) was discussed by the developers sometime in 2004, it has not materialised.

== Features ==
* Development snapshots are live and installation CD for x86 and SPARC architectures on one media, via the DuaLive technology.
* Latest snapshots have been extended to further boot a grml (a Linux-based rescue system, x86 only) via the Triforce technology
* &quot;mksh&quot; (MirBSD Korn shell): an actively developed flavour of KornShell and heir of pdksh
* The base system and some MirPorts store &quot;dotfiles&quot; data in ~/.etc. directory in user&#x27;s home to avoid cluttering the root of the home directory
* Application packages from the NetBSD-derived pkgsrc repositories were configured for use in MirBSD starting in 2011.
The most important differences to OpenBSD were:
* Completely rewritten, GRUB multi boot compatible, boot loader and boot manager without an 8 GiB limit and with Soekris support
* Slim base system (without NIS, Kerberos, BIND, i18n, BSD games, etc.), Bind and the BSDgames being available as a port
* Binary security updates for stable releases
* ISDN support
* IPv6 support in the web server software
* wtf, a database of acronyms
* Some of the GNUtools (like gzip and *roff) were replaced by original UNIX code released by Caldera International (SCO) under a BSD licence
* 64-bit time handling routines (time_t)
* Correct handling of leap seconds
* Full GCC 3.4 support: C, C++, Pascal, Objective-C
* Current versions of the GNU developer toolchain (rcs, binutils, gdb, texinfo, lynx etc.)
* GNU CVS 1.12 with custom extensions
* Improved random number generator
* Uses sv4cpio with/without CRC instead of tar archives as its package format; support for new formats in cpio
* Improved support for UTF-8 and the Unicode BMP, including wide character support for libncurses (&quot;libncursesw&quot;) and friends
** In fact, MirBSD only supports the BMP, so the &quot;UTF-8&quot; support is limited to the part common between UTF-8 and CESU-8.

== Cooperation ==
Aside from cooperating with other BSDs, submitting patches to upstream software authors, and synergy effects with FreeWRT, there was an active cooperation with Grml both in inclusion and technical areas. Other projects, such as Debian are also fed with MirSoftware.

== MirPorts ==
&quot;MirPorts&quot; was a derivative of the OpenBSD ports tree and was developed by Benny Siegert. MirPorts does not use the package tools from OpenBSD written in Perl, but continues to maintain the previous C-based tools. New features are in-place package upgrades and installing a MirPorts instance as a non-root user. Unlike OpenBSD ports, MirPorts are not tied to specific OS versions and even on stable releases using the newest version was recommended. &quot;MirLibtool&quot; was a modified version of GNU libtool 1.5 installed by MirPorts to build shared libraries in a portable way.

Multiple platforms are supported &quot;out of the box&quot;:

* MirOS BSD (-stable and -current)
* OpenBSD (-stable and -current)
* MidnightBSD
* Mac OS X (10.4 and newer) / Darwin

Following the MirOS BSD policy of faster software availability to the user, many ports removed for political reasons in OpenBSD (e.g. all the DJB software or the Flash Plugin) have been kept in MirPorts and can continue to be used. MirPorts was intended to be a place for unofficial or rejected OpenBSD ports.

<doc id="476312" wikidata="Q801616" url="?curid=476312" title="Wimbledon station">
<text>Wimbledon is an interchange station in the centre of Wimbledon for London Underground, London Trams and National Rail services, and is the only station in London that provides an interchange between the London Underground and Tramlink.

It serves as a junction for services from the Underground&#x27;s District line, two National Rail operators (South Western Railway and Thameslink), and Tramlink services. The station is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is from on the South West Main Line.

The station has 11 platforms. Platforms 1–4 are for London Underground, platforms 5 and 8 are for inner suburban South Western Railway services, platform 9 is for Thameslink and platforms 10a and 10b are for Tramlink. Platforms 6 and 7 are adjacent to the fast tracks intended for express and outer suburban South Western Railway services, but most of these services only call at Wimbledon during the Wimbledon Tennis Championships or on Sundays for outer suburban services. Access to these platforms is via sliding gates through safety fencing installed in March 2014.

==History==
The first railway station in Wimbledon was opened on 21 May 1838, when the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) opened its line from its terminus at Nine Elms in Battersea to Woking. The original station was to the south of the current station on the opposite side of the Wimbledon Bridge.

On 22 October 1855, the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway (W&amp;CR) opened the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line to West Croydon via Mitcham and on 1 October 1868 the Tooting, Merton and Wimbledon Railway (TM&amp;WR) opened a line to Streatham via Tooting Junction (now just Tooting). They shared a detached platform slightly to the southwest of the main LSWR station, until the whole station was relocated to the northeast of Wimbledon Bridge for the opening of the District Railway.

===The District line and Sutton loop===
On 3 June 1889, the District Railway (DR, now London Underground&#x27;s District line) opened the LSWR-built extension of its line from Putney Bridge, making Wimbledon station the new terminus of that branch and providing Wimbledon with a direct connection to the developing London Underground system. The station was rebuilt on its current site for the opening of this service. District line steam-hauled services were replaced by electric services from 27 August 1905.

The station was rebuilt again with its current Portland stone entrance building by the Southern Railway (SR, the post grouping successor to the L&amp;SWR) in the late 1920s as part of the SR&#x27;s construction of the line to Sutton. Parliamentary approval for this line had been obtained by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W&amp;SR) in 1910, but work was delayed by World War I. From the W&amp;SR&#x27;s inception, the DR was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the London Electric Railway (LER, precursor of London Underground) planned, through its ownership of the DR, to use part of the route for an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR, now the Northern line) to Sutton. The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&amp;SLR to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the LER giving up its rights over the W&amp;SR route.

The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. It opened on 7 July 1929 to South Merton and to Sutton on 5 January 1930.

===Tramlink=== 
On 2 June 1997, the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line was closed by Railtrack for conversion to operation as part of the Tramlink tram operations. Platform 10, originally the down platform for the Wimbledon &amp; Croydon and Wimbledon &amp; Sutton lines, was used for the single track terminus of Tramlink and rail tracks and infrastructure were replaced with those for the tram system. The new service opened on 30 May 2000. The other end of Platform 10 became a terminating bay for trains from the Tooting direction. Platform 9, the W&amp;C and W&amp;S up platform, became a reversible platform for all Thameslink services between the Sutton and Tooting lines. 

To increase the capacity of Tramlink services, a second platform was built in place of the former Thameslink bay. The service was suspended between Dundonald Road and Wimbledon from 13 July until November 2015 for the work to be carried out. The original tram platform was renumbered to &#x27;10a&#x27; with the new part called &#x27;10b&#x27;, opening on 2 November 2015. As a result, tram frequency increased from 8 per hour to 12 per hour from April 2016.

===Forecourt===

Before 14 March 2011, there was a roundabout outside the main entrance of the station to allow for vehicles to drop off passengers. This made the approach to the station somewhat cramped and not ideal during busy times. On 14 March 2011, vehicle access to the station&#x27;s forecourt was permanently removed and the approach to the station was completely repaved. This made the much larger open space outside the station&#x27;s entrance more ideal during busy times. These works were completed by June 2011 and the approach was hastily cleared in preparation for the Wimbledon Tennis Championships which would see a large increase in passengers passing through the station.

===Laddie===

Wimbledon station was also the haunt of a &#x27;Railway Collection Dog&#x27;. Airedale Terrier &quot;Laddie&quot; was born in September 1948 and started work on Wimbledon Station in 1949, collecting donations on behalf of the Southern Railwaymen&#x27;s Homes at Woking, via a box strapped to his back. He retired in 1956, having collected over £5,000 and spent the rest of his days with the residents at the Home.
Upon his death, in 1960, he was stuffed and returned to Wimbledon station. He continued to collect for the Homes, in a glass case situated on Platforms 7/8, until 1990, when he retired once more and became part of the National Railway Collection.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 12 October 1972, a freight train ran into the rear of an electric multiple unit that was standing at platform 10. Twelve people were injured. The accident was due to inattentiveness by the driver of the freight train.
*On 6 November 2017, a passenger train formed of two Class 450 electric multiple units derailed near Wimbledon. Four people were injured and over 300 passengers were evacuated from the train.

==Oyster cards==
Wimbledon station presents an unusual procedure with the Oyster card pay-as-you-go electronic ticketing system.
Ordinarily, London Underground and National Rail passengers with Oyster cards must &quot;touch in&quot; at the start of their journey and &quot;touch out&quot; at the end: those who fail to &quot;touch out&quot; will be charged the maximum possible fare from their starting point. However, Tramlink passengers starting a journey at Wimbledon, after passing through the entry gates, will not be able to &quot;touch out&quot; at the end of their tram journey, since tram stops provide no facility to do so; instead they must &quot;touch in&quot; a second time on the tram platform at Wimbledon, after passing through the ticket barrier, and the system will then recognise that no train or tube journey has been made.

A similar issue arises for passengers arriving at Wimbledon by tram. Normally tram users do not touch out, but at Wimbledon they must do so to leave the station: touching out at the regular turnstile accomplishes this. If, however, a passenger touches their card at a standalone Oyster reader (such as the one by the manual gates), the system will see this as starting a new journey rather than ending one, and will deduct a maximum fare from the card.

==Services==
===National Rail===
National Rail services at Wimbledon are operated by South Western Railway and Thameslink.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:

* 14 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to

A limited number of early morning and late evening trams to and from New Addington also run to and from Wimbledon.






==Future==

If Crossrail 2 is built, new tunnels will be dug between Wimbledon and Raynes Park, calling at Wimbledon in tunnel and routing trains via and central London to Hackney and beyond to either Alexandra Palace (in tunnel the whole way) or Hertford East (surfacing before Tottenham Hale, taking over the West Anglia Main Line north of there). This would provide another set of transport links for the area and direct services to and .

There is also a proposal for an extension of the Tramlink services running from Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden, St Helier and Rose Hill.

==Connections==
*London Buses routes 57, 93, 131, 156, 163, 164, 200, 219 and 493 and night route N87 serve the station.

<doc id="476320" wikidata="Q632686" url="?curid=476320" title="Xenophyophorea">
<text>Xenophyophorea is a clade of foraminiferans. Xenophyophores are multinucleate unicellular organisms found on the ocean floor throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, at depths of . They are a kind of foraminiferan that extract minerals from their surroundings and use them to form an exoskeleton known as a test.

They were first described by Henry Bowman Brady in 1883. They are abundant on abyssal plains, and in some regions are the dominant species. Fifteen genera and 75 species have been described, varying widely in size. The largest, &quot;Syringammina fragilissima&quot;, is among the largest known coenocytes, reaching up to in diameter.

== Naming and classification ==
The name Xenophyophora means &quot;bearer of foreign bodies&quot;, from the Greek. This refers to the sediments, called xenophyae, which are cemented together to construct their tests. In 1883, Henry Bowman Brady classified them as primitive Foraminifera. Later they were placed within the sponges. In the beginning of the 20th century they were considered an independent class of Rhizopoda, and later as a new eukaryotic phylum of Protista. Phylogenetic studies suggest that xenophyophores are a specialized group of monothalamous (single-chambered) Foraminifera.

A 2013 molecular study using small subunit rDNA found &quot;Syringammina&quot; and &quot;Shinkaiya&quot; to form a monophyletic clade closely related to &quot;Rhizammina algaeformis&quot;. Further molecular evidence has confirmed the monophyly of xenophyophores. This study also suggested that many individual genera are polyphyletic, with similar body shapes convergently evolving multiple times.

Historically xenophyophores have been divided into the agglutinated Psamminida and the flexible, proteinaceous Stannomida. However, cladistic analyses based on molecular data have suggested a high amount of homoplasy, and that the division between psamminids and stannomids is not well supported.

==Anatomy==

Xenophyophores are unicellular, but have many nuclei. 
Many form delicate and elaborate agglutinated tests—shells often made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and other foreign mineral particles glued together with organic cements—that range from a few millimetres to 20 centimetres across. The softness and structure of tests varies from soft and lumpy shapes to fans and complex structures.

Some xenophyophores—notably &quot;Psammina&quot;—have compartmentalized tests consisting of multiple chambers.

Species of this group are morphologically variable, but the general structural pattern includes a test enclosing a branching system of organic tubules together with masses of waste material.

A number of unique terms are used to refer to anatomical aspects of the group:

* Individual waste pellets are referred to as &quot;stercomes&quot; or &quot;stercomata&quot;; pellets that are bundled together in long strings are referred to as &quot;stercomares&quot;. Stercomares also include small, yellow-red spherical bodies known as &quot;xanthosomes&quot;.
* Xenophyophores also commonly have abundant crystals of barite called &quot;granellae&quot; within their cytoplasm. This is not to be confused with the &quot;granellare&quot;, which refers to the plasma body and its tube.
* &quot;Linellae&quot; are long (several mm in length), threadlike structures found outside of the granellare in some xenophyophores (genera traditionally grouped together as &quot;stannomida&quot;); they are flexible and form part of the test.
* &quot;Xenophyae&quot;, for which the group is named, are the agglutinated particles from which the test is constructed. They vary by species; they can contain sediment particles, sponge spicules, radiolarian tests, and even the tests of smaller foraminifera.

The protoplasm of xenophyophores contributes less than 1% of the total mass of the organism.

They select certain minerals and elements from their environment that are included in its tests and cytoplasm, or concentrated in excretions. The selected minerals vary with species, but often include barite, lead and uranium. The granellare of &quot;Shinkaiya&quot; have been found to contain high concentrations of mercury.

Studies have found unusually high concentrations of radioactive nuclides in xenophyophores; this was first reported in &quot;Occultammina&quot; but has since been found to be true of many other xenophyophore species from different parts of the ocean.

== Growth and reproduction ==
Very little is known about xenophyophore reproduction. It is assumed that an alternation of generations takes place, as in other foraminifera; however, this has not been confirmed.

Gametes form in a specialised part of the granellare that may look like swollen side-branch (in &quot;Psammetta&quot;) or a stalked bulb (in &quot;Cerelasma&quot;). Gametes are reportedly about 20 μm in diameter, with two flagella; after this, an amoeba-like stage seems to be present. It is also possible that the amoeboid stage represents amoeboid gametes, found in other foraminifera. These amoeboid structures are also sometimes found inside the granellare. Juveniles have occasionally been found in association with adults; in Psametta they are horseshoe-shaped and already covered in xenophyae.

The location of the initial plasma can sometimes be pointed out in adult xenophyophores. In some species this is denoted by a sharp change in the type of xenophyae; in others, the juvenile is regular and the adult is irregular; still others flip this pattern, so that the juvenile is irregular and the adult is regular.

Growth is episodic; one observational study taking place over a period of eight months saw a three-to-tenfold growth in specimens of &quot;Reticulammina labyrinthica&quot;. This growth occurred in phases lasting 2–3 days each; each phase was separated by a resting period of approximately two months. These growth phases were approximately synchronous between specimens, but it is unclear if this is biologically or developmentally controlled; some evidence suggests the synchrony may have been due to chance.

Each episode of growth occurred in three phases: first, the base becomes wider and flatter, causing the surface texture to become smoother; then, the original shape of the organism is regained (albeit larger); and finally, the surface texture is rebuilt. The rapid rate of growth observed suggests that xenophyophores may not be as long-lived as previously hypothesised.

== Habitat and range ==
Xenophyophores are an important part of the deep sea-floor, as they have been found in all four major ocean basins. They are often found in areas of enhanced organic carbon flux, such as beneath productive surface waters, in sub-marine canyons, in settings with sloped topography (e.g. seamounts, abyssal hills) and on continental slopes. They are not found in areas of hypoxic waters.

Xenophyophores have been found between depths of 500 and 10,600 metres. Most are epifaunal (living atop the seabed), but one species (&quot;Occultammina profunda&quot;), is known to be infaunal; it buries itself up to deep into the sediment.

Xenophyophore densities are highest on soft sediments; however, they may still be found on rocky substrates including basalts, canyon walls, and manganese crusts.

==Feeding==
The diet and feeding ecology of xenophyophores was long the subject of speculation; the fragile tests and deepwater habitat of the group makes &quot;in vivo&quot; observation difficult. Early propositions included suspension feeding, bacterial farming, deposit feeding, and trapping particulate matter inside the test. Studies have since confirmed active uptake of food from surrounding sediments using the pseudopodia and using the test to trap particles. Analysis of lipid concentrations within xenophyophores revealed especially high concentrations of bacteria in the stercomata, suggesting that xenophyophores utilise bacteria growing on their waste products in order to supplement their feeding.

A 2021 study that utilised isotopic labeling to examine the question of xenophyophore feeding confirmed rapid uptake of both diatoms and dissolved organic matter in the form of glucose. This study found no evidence to support a bacterial farming function for the test, and instead proposed that it aided to function in the collection of phytodetritus by increasing surface area. These authors argued that xenophyophores fill a major role in ocean-floor biogeochemical cycling.

== Fossil record ==
As of 2017, no positively-identified xenophyophore fossils had been discovered.

It has been suggested that the mysterious vendozoans of the Ediacaran period represent fossil xenophyophores. However, the discovery of C27 sterols associated with the fossils of &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; cast doubt on this identification, as these sterols are today associated only with animals. These researchers suggest that &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; and relatives are instead stem-bilaterians. Other ediacaran fossils, such as &quot;Palaeopascichnus&quot; &quot;Intrites&quot;, &quot;Yelovichnus&quot;, and &quot;Neonereites&quot; have been posited as fossil xenophyophores and linked to the Eocene fossil &quot;Benkovacina.&quot; However, analysis of the latter found neither barite crystals nor evidence of agglutinated foraminifera in the wall. A 2011 study that examined growth and development of &quot;Palaeopascichnus&quot; concluded it was likely not a xenophyophore. A 2014 study of &quot;Pteridinum&quot; reached similar conclusions.

Some researchers have suggested that the enigmatic graphoglyptids &quot;Paleodictyon&quot;, known from the early Cambrian through recent times, could represent the remains of xenophyophores, and noted the similarity of the extant xenophyophore &quot;Occultammina&quot; to the fossil. Supporting this notion is the similar abyssal habitat of living xenophyophores to the inferred habitat of fossil graphoglyptids; however, the large size (up to 0.5m) and regularity of many graphoglyptids as well as the apparent absence of xenophyae in their fossils casts doubt on the possibility. Modern examples of &quot;Paleodictyon&quot; have been discovered; however, no evidence of tests, stercomares, grannelares, or xenophyophore DNA was found, and the trace may alternately represent a burrow or a glass sponge.

Certain Carboniferous fossils have been suggested to represent the remains of xenophyophores due to the concentration of barium within the fossils as well as supposed morphological similarity; however, the barium content was later determined to be due to diagenetic alteration of the material and the morphology of the specimen instead supported an algal affinity.

==Ecology==

Local population densities may be as high as 2,000 individuals per , making them dominant organisms in some areas. Xenophyophores have been found to be &quot;ecosystem engineers&quot;, providing habitat and serving as traps for organic particles, increasing diversity in the surrounding area. Research has shown that areas dominated by xenophyophores have 3–4 times the number of benthic crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs than equivalent areas that lack xenophyophores. The xenophyophores themselves also play commensal host to a number of organisms—such as isopods (e.g., genus &quot;Hebefustis&quot;), sipunculan and polychaete worms, nematodes, and harpacticoid copepods—some of which may take up semi-permanent residence within a xenophyophore&#x27;s test. Brittle stars (Ophiuroidea) also appear to have a relationship with xenophyophores, as they are consistently found directly underneath or on top of the protozoans. They can also function as nurseries for fish; snailfish have been found to lay eggs in the shelter of the xenophyophore test.

Starfish, monoplacophorans, and molpadiid sea cucumbers have all been observed feeding on xenophyophores; specifically, the monoplacophoran &quot;Neopilina galatheae&quot; has been proposed as a specialised predator of the group.

Despite this abundance, the relatively low amount of protoplasm per unit of test means that xenophyophores often contribute little to total biomass.

Xenophyophores are difficult to study due to their extreme fragility. Specimens are invariably damaged during sampling, rendering them useless for captive study or cell culture. For this reason, very little is known of their life history. As they occur in all the world&#x27;s oceans and in great numbers, xenophyophores could be indispensable agents in the process of sediment deposition and in maintaining biological diversity in benthic ecosystems.

Scientists in the submersible DSV Alvin at a depth of 3,088 metres at the Alaskan continental margin in the Gulf of Alaska collected a spatangoid urchin, &quot;Cystochinus loveni&quot;, about 5 cm diameter, which was wearing a cloak consisting of over 1,000 protists and other creatures, including 245 living xenophyophores, mainly &quot;Psammina&quot; species, each 3–6 mm. The fragility of the xenophyophores suggests that the urchin either very carefully collected them, or that they settled and grew there. Among several possible explanations for the urchin&#x27;s behaviour, perhaps the most likely are chemical camouflage and weighing itself down to avoid being moved in currents.

Different xenophyophore ecomorphs are found in different settings; reticulated or heavily folded genera such as &quot;Reticulammina&quot; and &quot;Syringammina&quot; are more common in areas where the substrate is sloped or near canyon walls, while more fan-shaped forms like &quot;Stannophyllum&quot; are more common in areas with quieter water and/or lower primary productivity.

<text>The dickcissel (Spiza americana) is a small seed-eating migratory bird in the family Cardinalidae. It breeds on the prairie grasslands of the Midwestern United States and winters in Central America, northern Colombia, and northern Venezuela. It is the only member of the genus Spiza, though some sources list another supposedly extinct species (see below).

==Taxonomy==
The dickcissel was formally described in 1789 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name &quot;Emberiza americana&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;black throated bunting&quot; which the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant had described and illustrated in 1785 in his &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;. The dickcissel is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Spiza&quot; that was introduced in 1824 by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name &quot;Spiza&quot; is the Ancient Greek word for a common type of finch, now assumed to be a chaffinch. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

The dickcissel is part of a group of the Cardinalidae that also includes &quot;Amaurospiza, Cyanocompsa, Cyanoloxia&quot;, and &quot;Passerina&quot;. &quot;Spiza&quot; is the only one among these that lacks blue structural colors in its plumage. Though the color pattern and habits of the dickcissel make it stand apart from other Cardinalidae, its robust, cone-shaped bill – stouter than in American sparrows or true finches, which it somewhat resembles at first glance – gives away its relationships.

===&quot;Townsend&#x27;s dickcissel&quot;===

A problematic specimen is often discussed under the name of Spiza townsendi (or &quot;Spiza townsendii&quot;, the original misspelt specific name proposed by John James Audubon). This individual was collected on May 11, 1833, by Audubon&#x27;s colleague John Kirk Townsend in New Garden Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The specimen remains unique and nothing is known about what it represents with certainty; it had thus even been suggested to be an extinct relative. In 2014, Kyle Blaney photographed the bird in Ontario, proving its continuing existence.

It is commonly called &quot;Townsend&#x27;s dickcissel&quot; (or &quot;Townsend&#x27;s bunting&quot;, &quot;Townsend&#x27;s finch&quot;) in reference to the collector whom the scientific name honors. Rather than a distinct species or subspecies, it is (as certainly as this can be said in absence of direct proof) a color variant. Comparing the birds, it is immediately obvious that the yellow lipochrome pigments are entirely absent in &quot;Townsend&#x27;s dickcissel&quot;. The specimen has foxed today, giving it an altogether beige hue, but when originally shot, the olive areas of the head were grey as the cheeks, and the yellow and buff on face and underside was pure white. The brown wings and tail were rufous, due to the pheomelanins not being tinged by lipochromes.

Thus, this bird is very likely certainly the result of a simple genetic change, perhaps just a single point mutation, affecting some part of the carotinoid metabolism – essentially the same thing that happens in albinism, but in a different metabolic pathway. Though the bird seemed to be healthy and had survived to maturity when it found its untimely end through Townsend&#x27;s gun, no other such specimens have been documented before, nor ever since. Albinism and other pigment aberrations are not infrequently seen in birds, and the lack of further specimens is somewhat puzzling in that respect.

No specific details are known about the dickcissel&#x27;s lipochrome metabolism; it may be more fine-tuned than in other birds, so that most mutations therein will be lethal and Audubon&#x27;s bird was simply one of the very few individuals that survived. In wild birds, varying from species to species, some color aberrations are less frequently seen than others, and in captive birds such as canaries, some color mutations have only arisen a handful of times at most during several centuries of dedicated breeding and screening for novel color variants (see also Budgerigar colour genetics). While only a complete molecular biological study of the dickcissel&#x27;s metabolism and the specimen&#x27;s ancient DNA stands any reasonable chance to resolve the question with certainty, the hypothesis of an extremely uncommon color mutation is plausible, and such phenomena certainly occur in other Passeroidea.

Alternatively, the bird was considered a hybrid, but the present state of knowledge of the dickcissel&#x27;s relations makes this not very plausible; a number of species exist with which &quot;Spiza&quot; could conceivably produce hybrids, such as &quot;Passerina&quot;, but the lack of even the slightest hint of blue structural colors in Townsend&#x27;s specimen and it moreover being not different from a dickcissel in habitus makes the hybrid theory suspect. Regardless, Townsend observed the bird making vocalizations reminiscent more of an indigo bunting (&quot;Passerina cyanea&quot;), and by comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of the specimen with those of the dickcissel, the indigo bunting, and perhaps other &quot;Passerina&quot;, the hybridization hypothesis should be far more easy to prove or reject than a color aberration. On the other hand, not enough is known on whether dickcissels pick up their characteristic vocalizations from conspecific males or whether they are innate, thus no firm conclusion regarding Townsend&#x27;s observations has been made.

==Description==

Their length is , wingspan is , and weight is. Dickcissels have a large, pale bill, a yellow line over the eyes, brownish upperparts with black streaks on the back, dark wings, a rust patch on the shoulders, and light underparts. Adult males have a black throat patch, a yellow breast, and grey cheeks and crown. This head and breast pattern is especially brilliant in the breeding plumage, making it resemble an eastern meadowlark. Females and juveniles are brownish on the cheeks and crown, and are somewhat similar in appearance to house sparrows; they have streaked flanks.

In flight, they make a low, &quot;electric&quot;, buzzing &quot;fpppt&quot;. From an open perch in a field, this bird&#x27;s song is a sharp &quot;dick dick&quot; followed by a buzzed &quot;cissel&quot;, also transcribed as &quot;skee-dlees chis chis chis&quot; or &quot;dick dick ciss ciss ciss&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is fields in midwestern North America. Following the breeding season the species migrates in large flocks to southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. They may occur as vagrants well outside of their normal range. From 1966 to 2015 the dickcissel experienced a greater than 1.5% population reduction in the northern part of its breeding range and throughout the Midwestern United States.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The birds migrate to their breeding range rather late, with the first arriving only in May, with most birds only arriving in early June. They nest near the ground in dense grasses or small shrubs, or up to high in bushes and trees. Males may have up to six mates, with most attracting only one or two, and several failing to attract any mates at all. Yet if such &quot;bachelors&quot; survive until the next summer, they will get another try to attract females, as the partners only stay together for raising one brood. Dickcissels are thus among the few songbirds that are truly polygynous. When they leave for winter quarters by early August or so, what little pair bond existed during the summer is broken up.

===Feeding===
Dickcissels forage on the ground or in fields. They mainly eat insects and seeds. Outside of the nesting season, they usually feed in flocks. They are considered a pest by farmers in some regions because flocks can consume large quantities of cultivated grains.

Dickcissel populations frequently fluctuate in numbers, even to the extent that their range changes notably. In the early 19th century, dickcissels expanded eastward, establishing a population in New England and the mid-Atlantic states that disappeared around the end of the century. Both appearance and disappearance were probably related to changes in land use.

<text>West Green is one of the 14 residential neighbourhoods in Crawley, a town and borough in West Sussex, England. Crawley was planned and laid out as a New Town after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings. West Green was the first neighbourhood to be developed, and is one of the smallest and closest to the town centre.

==Location within Crawley==
West Green is a roughly triangular area of , bounded by the Arun Valley railway line to the south, the A23 (Crawley Avenue) to the west and north, and the High Street to the east. The latter formed part of the main London to Brighton road until it was bypassed in the 1930s. Northgate and the town centre lie to the east, Southgate is to the south, Ifield is to the west and Langley Green shares a border to the north.

When the New Town was planned, each neighbourhood was allocated a colour, which appears on street name signs together with the neighbourhood&#x27;s name. West Green&#x27;s colour is dark blue.

==History==
A small settlement developed in the Anglo-Saxon era around a crossroads where a northeast–southwest trackway connecting the main Saxon-era estates and farms of the Weald crossed an east–west route between Worth and Ifield. After the Norman Conquest, the pattern of land use and travel changed, and a new north–south route between London and the south coast developed slightly to the east. Crawley, originally a small village itself, grew around this from the 13th century onwards. The two settlements, apart, grew slowly alongside each other for the next few centuries. The name &quot;West Green&quot; was first recorded in 1532.

In the 19th century, the increasing prosperity of Crawley—by now, a thriving market town—stimulated residential growth in West Green. In 1841 it had only 20 houses, but the arrival of the railway in the town in 1848 was significant: the existing development at West Green was close to Crawley railway station, and land was available for further building. This took place haphazardly and without any planning: local builders erected individual houses or streets speculatively and in a mixture of styles. The variety of villas, semi-detached houses and terraces in Leopold, Spencers, Victoria, Albany and Princess Roads—built in the 1880s just north of the railway line— typify this. In the same decade a small chapel was built—the forerunner of St Peter&#x27;s Church, an Anglican church built on a triangle of land near the ancient crossroads in 1893. The east–west track had become the main Ifield Road, and Horsham Rural District Council—responsible for the land in the early 20th century—built some council housing along the road in the interwar period. Overall, of approximately 900 houses built in Crawley during that time, more than 100 were built in West Green.

John George Haigh, who moved to Crawley from London in 1943, carried out six murders—known as the &quot;Acid Bath Murders&quot;—at a workshop in Leopold Road between 1944 and 1949. He was hanged for his crimes in August of that year. The case brought notoriety to the town and aroused considerable interest among local people.

===New Town era===

Crawley was designated as a New Town in January 1947 after the New Towns Act 1946 identified it as a suitable site for one. Crawley Development Corporation was formed, led by the architect Thomas Bennett, and planner Anthony Minoprio provided a master plan for the town&#x27;s development. He proposed a double ring of nine neighbourhoods surrounding an extended town centre; West Green was to be one of the inner ring of four, and the first to be built. By 1949, when building work started, West Green&#x27;s population was about 2,000—mainly concentrated in the area between Ifield Road and the railway line—and the Development Corporation had to consider how to fit new development around this.

By the end of the 1948–1949 financial year, the Development Corporation had bought of land in West Green, and was negotiating the acquisition, mostly by compulsory purchase order, of another . At that stage, were intended to be developed immediately. Most of the land was designated for housing, the neighbourhood centre (parade of shops, pub and community centre) and a new school, but about were reserved for open space and allotments. Minoprio planned a wide variety of housing types, from high-density low-rise blocks of flats near the town centre to large detached houses.

The New Town&#x27;s first set of houses were built in West Green during this period. In 1947, the Development Corporation granted the design contract for 34 houses to architectural practice Godman &amp; Kay. A Hove-based firm, H.J. Paris Ltd, won the £7,397 (£ today) contract for the road construction and site preparation in 1948. The Horsham-based building firm Hoad &amp; Taylor built the houses at a cost of £45,220 (£ today), and residents moved in during the summer of 1949. The road ran northeastwards from the old Ifield Road and was named Smalls Mead; it lay near the path of one section of the ancient trackway, which had historically been called Smalls Lane. By 1952, 622 houses had been built or started, and the neighbourhood was effectively complete in 1954. By that time, the neighbourhood centre—with shops, post office, community centre and public house—had been established at the junction of Ewhurst Road and West Green Drive.

The southeastern corner of the neighbourhood was redeveloped early in the 21st century as part of the Borough Council&#x27;s efforts to improve the town centre. Robinson Road, the site of Crawley&#x27;s original hospital, post office and school, was demolished, and Spencers Road was severed. A large mixed-use development, anchored by an Asda superstore, was completed on the site in September 2003. Around the same time at the other end of the High Street, and again just within the boundary of West Green, the Crawley Leisure Park was built on the site of the Sun Inn. This was an old house at the northern end of Crawley village, which was converted into an inn in the 1870s.

==Demography==

The neighbourhood is coterminous with the administrative ward of the same name, which is one of the fifteen wards in Crawley. These divisions are used for collecting census and other statistical and demographic data. It had a population of 4,404 at the 2001 United Kingdom Census. Its population density was therefore —much higher than the figure of for Crawley overall. There were 2,005 households, of which 1,125 (56%) were owned by the occupier, 668 (33%) were rented from Crawley Borough Council or another public-sector landlord, 143 (7%) were rented privately and 69 (3%) were occupied rent-free. The rate of owner-occupancy is much lower than in Crawley as a whole, and a much higher proportion of housing is rented from the council.

According to the census, 91.2% of residents are White, 6.2% are Asian or Asian-British, 1% are Black or Black-British, 0.9% are mixed-race and 0.7% are from another ethnic background. The proportion of white people is slightly higher, and that of Asian people slightly lower, than in Crawley overall; other proportions are comparable to Crawley as a whole. The age distribution of West Green&#x27;s population is different from that of Crawley as a whole: as at the 2001 census, 866 (19.7% of residents) were under 18 years old, 2,558 (58.1%) were between 18 and 64 years old, and 980 (22.3%) were 65 years old and over. The corresponding figures for Crawley were 23,748 (23.8%), 61,338 (61.5%) and 14,658 (14.7%), indicating that West Green has an older age profile.

==Services==

Crawley Hospital was built on a site in West Green Drive between 1959 and 1962. It was extended in the late 1960s and in 1981. It replaced a 1930s building which had in turn succeeded a small cottage hospital at the south end of Crawley High Street. Since the 1990s many services have been moved to East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, and Crawley Hospital now has &quot;sub-acute&quot; status and has 143 beds. Crawley&#x27;s ambulance station was moved to playing fields off Ifield Avenue by the early 1980s from its former town-centre location. Crawley fire station, headquarters of the Crawley and Mid Sussex District Team of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, is on the same road. The station has five vehicle bays with three standard water tenders, a heavy rescue tender and a four-wheel drive appliance. It received 1,390 calls in the 2009–10 reporting year.

The town&#x27;s main cemetery, which existed before the New town was planned, is in the far southwest corner of West Green, between the bypass and the railway line.

==Public buildings==
Until the early 20th century, West Green was in the Parish of Ifield. Its Anglican parish church, St Margaret&#x27;s, was distant from the community; so in 1880 a chapel of ease, St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s, was built. This was replaced by a larger church, St Peter&#x27;s, in 1892. This was given its own parish in 1901: the Parish of West Crawley was created from territory moved from Ifield. St Peter&#x27;s Church was designed by W. Hilton Nash and built by local construction firm owner Richard Cook. The sandstone building, with a chancel, single-aisled nave, vestry and bell-turret, holds 439 people and cost £2,800 (£ as of 2009) to build. It was for many years a part of the Parish of Crawley under St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church. On 8 September 2017 St Peter&#x27;s became the parish church of the newly created Parish of West Green St Peter.

Crawley Baptist Church, established in 1883, moved to Crabtree Road in West Green in 1954. The building was demolished in 2002 and replaced with a new structure on the same site. Crawley&#x27;s Hindu community established a mandir (temple) on Spencers Road in about 1970; and the Sikh community have a gurdwara on the same street, which in 2009 was due to be demolished and replaced with a larger building. No work has taken place as of 2025.

A Church of England school was opened on West Green Drive in the 1930s. In 1951, the Local Education Authority set up a temporary school on the site in response to the early growth of the New Town, and permanent infant and junior school divisions were opened in 1952 and 1953 respectively. Under the name of West Green Primary School, the school now has seven classes of pupils between the ages of 4 and 11.

The master plan proposed that a neighbourhood centre, consisting of community centre, public house, school, church and shopping parade, should be an integral part of each neighbourhood. The Development Corporation provided a temporary community centre building, and West Sussex County Council extended the school building in 1954 to provide a permanent facility. This was augmented by a youth centre in 1960. A pub, the Apple Tree, was built in the mid-1950s, and the Development Corporation provided a parade of seven shops: the smallest parade in any of Crawley&#x27;s neighbourhoods, reflecting its proximity to the town centre.

==Listed buildings==


The boundary between the West Green and Northgate neighbourhoods follows the ancient parish boundary between the Parishes of Ifield and Crawley. This ran up the middle of the High Street, so all buildings on its west side are within West Green. There are five listed buildings in the neighbourhood.

The George Hotel, listed at Grade II*, is an early 16th-century coaching inn which expanded over the next two centuries to take over surrounding buildings. Crawley&#x27;s location midway between London and Brighton on the direct route between them, which was turnpiked in 1770, contributed to its growth, as it became the natural stopping place for traffic of all types. Extensive changes in the next two centuries included various extensions and the building of an annexe (since demolished) in the middle of the High Street.

The other four listed buildings have a Grade II designation. The building now designated as 34 and 36 High Street is a two-storey, red-brick building dating from the late 18th century, with six sash windows, a pair of original brick chimneys and a tiled roof. The ground floor has been converted into two retail units. Further north, 44–48 High Street, on the corner of Ifield Road, is a group of three shop units housed in a building originally constructed as a four-bay timber-framed house in about 1600. The exterior is now stuccoed, and the building was redesigned in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was converted into shops. There are four equally spaced 19th-century sash windows on the side facing the High Street. The north face, fronting Ifield Road, has a jettied overhang, a traditional feature of timber-framed buildings in the area; the main (east) side was originally jettied as well but has since been built up. The oldest visible parts of the building are the southernmost bay, where there is 17th-century brickwork and timber, and the chimney from the same period. Many early 18th-century fittings remain inside. On Ifield Road itself, a now-derelict house at No. 10 is a mid-17th-century timber-framed house with exterior tile-hanging and 19th-century brickwork; and No. 60 and 62 were a pair of cottages created in the 19th century from a 16th-century timber-framed farmhouse, which is now used as one building again. Its exterior is partly of brick and partly tile-hung, the roof is tiled, and substantial wooden beams and trusses are visible inside.

==Transport==
Metrobus, which operates all local bus services in Crawley, serves Crawley Hospital and other stops in West Green on routes 1 and 2. There is also a free service from Crawley bus station to the Asda superstore. Crawley railway station is near the southeastern corner of the neighbourhood, and Ifield railway station is close to the west side.

Levels of vehicle ownership, as measured by the 2001 census, are lower than in Crawley as a whole. At the census date, the mean number of vehicles per household was 0.97 (the overall Crawley figure was 1.21), and 32.4% of households had no transport of their own, compared to 20.4% in Crawley overall.

<text>Nigel de Longchamps, also known as &quot;Nigel Wireker&quot;, (fl. c. 1190, died c. 1200), &quot;Neel de Longchamps&quot;, or &quot;Nigel of Canterbury&quot;, was an Anglo-Norman satirist and poet of the late twelfth century, writing in Latin. He is known to have been a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, from 1186 to 1193, and perhaps earlier (he claims to have met Thomas Becket, killed in 1170).

==Works==

===Speculum stultorum===
He is the author of the &quot;Speculum stultorum&quot; (A Mirror of Fools), a satire in Latin elegiac verse on the clergy and society in general. The hero is Burnellus, or Brunellus, a foolish ass, who goes in search of a means of lengthening his tail. Brunellus first visits Salernum to obtain drugs for this purpose. However, he loses these when attacked by a Cistercian monk with dogs. He then goes to Paris to study, but makes no progress there, being unable to remember the city&#x27;s name after eight years of study. He then decides to join a religious order, but instead founds a new one by taking the easiest parts from the rules of other orders. Finally, his master recaptures him.

The poem was immensely popular for centuries. Under the title &quot;Daun Burnel the Asse&quot; it is mentioned by Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales, in the Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale.

===Other works===
Many other short Latin poems from a thirteenth-century manuscript are attributed to him, along with a prose treatise, &quot;Contra Curiales et Officinales Clericos&quot;. This treatise is an affectionate reproof to William Longchamp the Chancellor, in his role as Bishop of Ely. Wireker takes his intimate friend (possibly a relative) to task for attempting to combine Church with State.

<doc id="476342" wikidata="Q1477486" url="?curid=476342" title="Rajas">
<text>Rajas (Sanskrit: रजस्) is one of the three &quot;guṇas&quot; (tendencies, qualities, attributes), a philosophical and psychological concept developed by the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The other two qualities are &quot;sattva&quot; (goodness, balance) and &quot;tamas&quot; (lethargy, violence, disorder). &quot;Rajas&quot; is innate tendency or quality that drives motion, energy and activity.

&quot;Rajas&quot; is sometimes translated as passion, where it is used in the sense of activity, without any particular value and it can contextually be either good or bad. &quot;Rajas&quot; helps actualize the other two &quot;guṇa&quot;. In simply it is the mixture of both &quot;sattva&quot; and &quot;tamas&quot;.

==Description==
In Samkhya philosophy, a is one of three &quot;tendencies, qualities&quot;: &quot;sattva&quot;, &quot;rajas&quot; and &quot;tamas&quot;. This category of qualities have been widely adopted by various schools of Hinduism for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. The three qualities are:

* &quot;Sattva&quot; is the quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, universalizing, holistic, constructive, creative, building, positive attitude, luminous, serenity, being-ness, peaceful, virtuous.
* &quot;Rajas&quot; is the quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, self-centeredness, egoistic, individualizing, driven, moving, dynamic.
* &quot;Tamas&quot; is the quality of imbalance, disorder, chaos, anxiety, impure, destructive, delusion, negative, dull or inactive, apathy, inertia or lethargy, violent, vicious, ignorant.

In Indian philosophy, these qualities are not considered as present in either-or fashion. Rather, everyone and everything has all three, only in different proportions and in different contexts. The living being or substance is viewed as the net result of the joint effect of these three qualities.

According to Samkhya school, no one and nothing is either purely &quot;sattvic&quot; or purely &quot;rajasic&quot; or purely &quot;tamasic&quot;. One&#x27;s nature and behavior is a complex interplay of all of these, with each &quot;guna&quot; in varying degrees. In some, the conduct is &quot;rajasic&quot; with significant influence of &quot;sattvic guṇa&quot;, in some it is &quot;rajasic&quot; with significant influence of &quot;tamasic guna&quot;, and so on.

In the fourteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;rajas&quot; is described as being of a passionate nature, driving desire, attachment, and action. When rajas is dominant, it manifests as greed, restlessness, agitation, and constant engagement in actions, which obscure wisdom and keep one bound to the cycle of worldly pursuits.

==Discussion==
&quot;Rajas&quot; is that quality or attribute in a substance (prakriti) or individual which promotes or upholds the activity of the other aspects of nature (prakriti) such as one or more of the following:
# action;famous 
# change, mutation;
# passion, excitement;
# birth, creation, generation.
If a person or thing tends to be extremely active, excitable, or passionate, that person or thing could be said to have a preponderance of &quot;rajas&quot;. It is contrasted with the quality of &quot;tamas&quot;, which is the quality of inactivity, darkness, and laziness, and with &quot;sattva&quot;, which is the quality of purity, clarity, calmness and creativity. &quot;Rajas&quot; is viewed as being more positive than &quot;tamas&quot;, and less positive than &quot;sattva&quot;, except, perhaps, for one who has &quot;transcended the gunas&quot; and achieved equanimity in all fields of relative life.

<doc id="476344" wikidata="Q877719" url="?curid=476344" title="Fiordland National Park">
<text>Fiordland National Park is a national park in the south-west corner of South Island of New Zealand. It is the largest of the 13 national parks in New Zealand, with an area covering , and a major part of the Te Wāhipounamu a UNESCO World Heritage Site established in 1990. The park is administered by the Department of Conservation. The southern ranges of the Southern Alps cover most of Fiordland National Park, combined with the deep glacier-carved valleys.

The park is a significant refuge for many threatened native animals, ranging from dolphins and bats to reptiles, insects, and endangered species of birds endemic to New Zealand such as the takahē, mōhua, kākāpō, and southern brown kiwi.

==History==
===Māori history===
One of the earliest settlers on the South Island were the Waitaha people, who are believed to have settled directly to the South Island from &quot;Hawaiki&quot; on the &quot;Uruao&quot; canoe. Later migrations of Kāti Māmoe from the North Island. Similarly, Ngāi Tahu later migrated from the North Island and joining the Kāti Māmoe iwi. The Māori history of Fiordland can be traced for more than 1000 years with the creation of Ngāi Tahu. Its waterways that make up the fiords were intended to provide havens along its rugged coastline, which had plenty of forests and birds to sustain travellers. Fiordland offered many other resources to sustain groups on their expeditions such as, kākāpō and shellfish.

In Māori mythology, the fiords are created by the workmanship of &quot;Tū Te Rakiwhanoa&quot;, who carved indentations into the coastline to make it habitable. But habitation in Fiordland has always been thin. Although, Māori made seasonal visits here to fish, hunt and to collect greenstone from Milford Sound, and tribal groups found sanctuary here, living amid the penguins and seals. In Māori mythology, a legend named &quot;Hine-nui-te-pō&quot; created sandflys to keep people from becoming idle in Fiordland to protect people from its &quot;beauty&quot;.

===European history===
Captain James Cook, a British explorer, circumnavigated the South Island with his crew of HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; in March 1770. They advanced towards the south-west coast of Fiordland but sailed away since it was late. Although they did not enter Dusky Sound on their first voyage to New Zealand, Cook noted the presence of a promising harbour here, and giving it the name &quot;Dusky Bay&quot;. They managed to shelter at Dusky Sound during their second voyage aboard HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; and Cook met some Māori families while they were sheltered here. Andreas Reischek, an Austrian naturalist explored Fiordland in the late 1880s. His collection of bird skins from the area were destroyed after being waterlogged as a result of inadequate stowage aboard the &quot;Stella&quot;. Despite his contributions to the study of New Zealand natural history, Reischek is remembered for his theft of &quot;taonga&quot; from Māori hosts.

 of Fiordland were set aside as a national reserve in 1904, following suggestions by then-future Prime Minister Thomas Mackenzie and Southland Commissioner of Crown Lands, John Hay, that the region should be declared a national park.

The area had already become a destination for trampers, following the opening up of the Milford Track from Lake Te Anau to Milford Sound in 1889 by New Zealand explorers Quintin McKinnon and Donald Sutherland, which received significant publicity from a 1908 article in the London Spectator describing it as the &quot;Finest Walk in the World&quot;.

The Fiordland &quot;public reserve&quot; was created as a park administered by the Department of Lands and Survey - in practical terms similar to a National Park. The only two officially named &quot;national parks&quot; in New Zealand at the time, Tongariro National Park and Egmont National Park, were administered by park boards. Consolidation of the management of these parks led to the National Parks Act of 1952, which brought Fiordland National Park into the fold, formally making it the third National Park in New Zealand.
Fiordland National Park&#x27;s establishment in the early 1950s occurred the same time with the opening of the Homer Tunnel for public use, which provided road access to Milford Sound.

==Geography==

During the cooler past, glaciers carved many deep fiords, the most famous (and most visited) of which is Milford Sound / Piopiotahi. Other notable fiords include Doubtful Sound / Patea and Tamatea / Dusky Sound. The retreat of the glaciers after the ice age left behind U-shaped valleys with sheer cliffs and as a result Fiordland&#x27;s coast is steep and crenellated, with some of the 15 fiords reaching as far as inland.

The southern ranges of the Southern Alps cover most of Fiordland National Park and, combined with the deep glacier-carved valleys, present a highly inaccessible landscape. At the northern end of the park, the Darran Mountains contain several peaks rising to over , with views of Mount Aspiring / Tititea to the north in the neighbouring Mount Aspiring National Park. Further south, the Franklin Mountains, Stuart Mountains, and Murchison Mountains reach around , with the peaks diminishing in height from north to south. The Kepler, Dingwall, Kaherekoau, Princess and Cameron Mountains further south only reach .

The carving action of the glaciers has succeeded in cutting off islands from the mainland, leaving two large uninhabited offshore islands, Secretary Island and Resolution Island, as well as many smaller ones. Although these glaciers are long-gone, a few small glaciers and permanent snow fields remain, with the southernmost glacier situated below Caroline Peak.

Several large lakes lie wholly or partly within the park&#x27;s boundaries, notably Lake Te Anau and Lake Manapouri, both on the western boundary of the national park, as well as the southern lakes Lake Monowai, Lake Hauroko, and Lake Poteriteri. All of these lakes exhibit the topography typical of glacier-carved valleys, with Lake Te Anau and Lake Manapouri in particular having several arms similar in look to the fiords on the west coast of the park.

The Sutherland Falls, to the southwest of Milford Sound on the Milford Track, are among the world&#x27;s highest waterfalls. Other tall waterfalls in the park include Browne Falls, Humboldt Falls, Lady Alice Falls, and Bowen Falls, as well as countless temporary waterfalls in the fiords that come alive following rainfall.

===Climate===
Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains; the cooling of this air as it rises produces a prodigious amount of rainfall, exceeding seven metres in many parts of the park. This supports the lush temperate rainforests of the Fiordland temperate forests ecoregion.


==Ecology==
===Flora===
Fiordland National Park contains the majority of the largest area of unmodified vegetation in New Zealand. The dense forests, often clinging to steep valley sides, comprise mostly silver beech and mountain beech, but also podocarps. A large variety of shrubs and ferns, often dominated by crown fern, make up a rich understory of plants, with the forest floor covered in mosses and liverworts. The abundant vegetation is supported by the high rainfall, but continues to be damaged by introduced species such as red deer and possum.

===Fauna===
The park is also a significant refuge for many threatened native animals, ranging from dolphins and bats to reptiles, insects, and birds. Among the birds are several endangered species endemic to New Zealand such as the takahē, mōhua (yellowhead), and the critically endangered kākāpō, the only flightless parrot in the world. The vulnerable Fiordland crested penguin and southern brown kiwi are also almost exclusively found within the park.

The special nature of the Fiordland area for conservation was recognised in the late 1890s by Richard Henry, pioneering the transfer of threatened species such as kākāpō and kiwi to islands in Dusky Sound. Conservation work and management of endangered species continues via a number of programmes by the Department of Conservation. The Takahē Recovery Programme ensures the survival of the last wild population of takahē. This unique bird, the largest living member of the rail family, was once thought to be extinct. After rediscovery of the takahē in the Murchison Mountains in 1948, a special area of was set aside in Fiordland National Park for its conservation, with the population reaching a milestone of 300 birds in 2016. Although the National Park comprises 15% of New Zealand&#x27;s conservation estate, it receives less than 1% of the Department of Conservation&#x27;s pest-control budget.

Several offshore islands belonging to Fiordland National Park are dedicated sanctuaries for threatened native species:

*Anchor Island - kākāpō, little spotted kiwi, tīeke (saddleback), mōhua
*Bauza Island - tīeke
*Breaksea Island - tīeke, mōhua, knobbled weevil, Fiordland skink
*Chalky Island - Te Kakahu skink, tīeke, mōhua, kākāpō, little spotted kiwi, orange-fronted kākāriki
*Coal Island - tokoeka (Haast brown kiwi), mōhua
*Indian Island
*Passage Islands
*Resolution Island - New Zealand rock wren, mōhua, tīeke, knobbled weevil
*Secretary Island - Fiordland crested penguin, kiwi/tokoeka, rock wren, kōkako, takahē, mōhua, endemic mistletoe species

Mōhua and tokoeka (Haast brown kiwi) have also been released on Pomona Island in Lake Te Anau, and the Eglinton Valley contains significant populations of long-tailed bats.

In addition to these sanctuaries, there are also three sizeable possum-free islands in the fiords of the national park: Cooper Island and Long Island in Dusky Sound / Tamatea, and Great Island in Taiari / Chalky Inlet. However, these islands are still occupied by stoats, rats or mice, compromising their suitability as bird sanctuaries.

==Conservation and human interaction==

Fiordland became the scene of one of New Zealand&#x27;s most significant conservation debates when in the 1960s it was proposed to raise the level of Lake Manapouri to assist hydro-electricity production at West Arm. The ensuing battle resulted in government ultimately bowing to the weight of petitions and passing a bill in the 1970s that gave the lake statutory protection.

In 1986, Fiordland National Park was individually recognised as a World Heritage Site, and in 1990, together with three other national parks to the north, as part of the Te Wāhipounamu World Heritage Area.

The park&#x27;s protected area includes all of the islands along its coast, as well as the remote Solander Islands. Although the park&#x27;s seaward-boundary is at the mean high water mark, a total of ten adjoining marine reserves protect large areas of water in several of the fiords. The most recent expansion of Fiordland National Park was the 1999 addition of the Waitutu Forest. Possible future additions are Big Bay, parts of the Livingston/Eglinton Ranges, and the Dean/Rowallan catchment area.


===Access===

Main road access into Fiordland National Park is limited to the Milford Road (SH 94), which runs north from Te Anau, skirting the edge of the park before entering the park as the highway joins the valley of the Eglinton River just north of Te Anau Downs. From there the road continues to the northwest corner of the park, passing through the Hollyford Valley and then through the Homer Tunnel on the descent to the terminus of the road at Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, where there is a large car park, a wharf for the tour boats, and a visitor centre.

A handful of other roads provide access to various entry points into the national park:

* An unsealed side road in the upper Hollyford Valley leads to the start of the Hollyford Track.
* runs close to the park&#x27;s boundary between Te Anau and Manapouri, with minor side roads to two entry points along the Kepler loop track,
* a narrow winding gravel road runs along the Borland and the Grebe Valley, providing access to three tramping tracks and to a campsite at Lake Manapouri&#x27;s South Arm,
* a short unsealed access road leads to a campsite at Lake Monowai and the start of two tramping tracks,
* another unsealed road runs up the Lill Burn Valley and to tramping tracks in the area south of Lake Hauroko, including a track to Lake Poteriteri, the largest lake in New Zealand with no road access.

A gravel road not connected to the rest of the public road network links Doubtful Sound / Patea with the western edge of Lake Manapouri via Wilmot Pass. That road is only used by shuttle buses for Doubtful Sound tours from Manapouri, which include a boat transfer across Lake Manapouri and bus transfer over Wilmot Pass to tour boats awaiting at a small jetty in Doubtful Sound.

Light aircraft and helicopter services link with Milford Sound, which also has a small boat marina.

Parts of Fiordland National Park are a designated Wilderness Area and aircraft landings are not permitted. The Wilderness Areas award special protection for large tracts of wild land containing natural features of such significance that they are preserved in their natural condition, without any man-made structures or facilities. Entry is usually restricted to foot travel, there are typically no tramping tracks, and in some cases, special permits are required, such as for several offshore islands and the Takahē Specially Protected Area in the Murchison Mountains.

===Activities===
Fiordland National Park is the most popular national park in New Zealand for international visitors. Well over half a million people visit the national park every year, however, the visitor numbers are almost exclusively concentrated in the park&#x27;s northern and eastern corridor from Te Anau to Milford Sound.

Most tourists are attracted to the easily accessible areas of the national park such as Milford Sound, where boat tours of the fiord and kayaking are the most popular activities. Some boat tour packages include a visit to the Milford Discovery Centre &amp; Underwater Observatory.
Along the Milford Road from Te Anau there are also camping grounds and several short walks, some of which are even accessible by wheelchair. Popular stopping points along the road are at the Mirror Lakes, the Homer Pass area immediately to the east of the tunnel, and The Chasm.

Te Anau, situated on the shore of Lake Te Anau, is the closest town to the national park and provides many accommodation options as well as all the amenities expected of a small town. The only other settlement close to the park is the much smaller Manapouri.

Doubtful Sound also offers boat tours. These day-long tours depart from Manapouri and include return boat transfer across Lake Manapouri and bus transfer over Wilmot Pass to get to Doubtful Sound. From Te Anau, boat trips across the lake to the Te Ana-au Caves are available.

Fiordland National Park is also a popular destination for alpine climbers and especially for trampers, with the multi-day Milford, Kepler and Hollyford tracks, and half of the Routeburn Track within the park. The latter three can also be walked in and out as day walks, whereas access to both ends of the Milford Track is only via boat and is regulated and must be pre-booked, in particular during the summer peak season.

Aside from these major tramping tracks, which also offer guided walks, dozens of lesser known tracks are maintained by the Department of Conservation, ranging from tracks requiring intermediate skills, such as the Hump Ridge Track and the Lake Marian track to advanced multi-day hikes like the Dusky Track and several routes that should only be attempted by experienced trampers. Fiordland is a challenging tramping destination, and given the size of the national park, there are few tracks. Off-track travel by expert trampers often relies on following deer trails. Sandflies, flooding and poor weather are a hazard, and being stranded for a day or two due to flooded river crossings is not uncommon on tracks like the Dusky Track. Trampers on these remote tracks also face three-wire bridges, tree falls, and rough terrain where mud can be knee-deep.

Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, Te Houhou / George Sound, Doubtful Sound / Patea, and Dusky Sound / Tamatea are the only fiords accessible via tracks or routes. Inland, the southern lakes of Lake Monowai and Lake Hauroko have road access to campsites and tracks, and Lake Poteriteri can be reached via a tramping track.

The steep granite peaks of the Darren Mountains are a popular area for mountain climbers.
The park is also a renowned destination for rainbow trout and brown trout fly fishing.

=== Management of invasive species ===
Red deer were introduced to New Zealand in the 1850s and they subsequently colonised the Fiordland Park area. By the 1920s, the large herds of wild deer in the NZ back country competing with sheep and cattle for feed resulted in pressure on the NZ government from the farming community, and deer cullers were employed by the Internal Affairs department to indiscriminately shoot deer in an effort to reduce the population. Costs were recouped from the sale of deer hides.

During the early 1960s, an international market for wild venison was established, and with no restrictions on hunting, market hunters established themselves in the rugged park country and used pack horses, jetboats and fixed wing aircraft to get the carcasses out to market. Experiments with shooting wild deer from helicopters were highly successful and a competitive industry was based on this technique. By the late 1970s, the deer population in Fiordland had been severely reduced, and combined with a flourishing deer farming industry this has reduced the impact of aerial hunting over the national park. Market helicopter-based hunting in Fiordland continues today in a reduced fashion, with the largest market being Germany.

The Department of Conservation also uses helicopters to poison the invasive possum population with aerial dropping of 1080 poison, despite some public opposition.

==In popular culture==
The scenic, rugged landscape is known for its natural beauty, making it a very popular sight-seeing and filming location. Milford Sound and areas of Fiordland National Park were used to depict the Misty Mountains during filming of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The area was again used extensively in &quot;The Hobbit Trilogy&quot;. Parts of the 2017 film &quot;&quot; were filmed in the park, as well as &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

<doc id="476351" wikidata="Q1323330" url="?curid=476351" title="Ekman number">
<text>The Ekman number (Ek) is a dimensionless number used in fluid dynamics to describe the ratio of viscous forces to Coriolis forces. It is frequently used in describing geophysical phenomena in the oceans and atmosphere in order to characterise the ratio of viscous forces to the Coriolis forces arising from planetary rotation. It is named after the Swedish oceanographer Vagn Walfrid Ekman.

When the Ekman number is small, disturbances are able to propagate before decaying owing to low frictional effects. The Ekman number also describes the order of magnitude for the thickness of an Ekman layer, a boundary layer in which viscous diffusion is balanced by Coriolis effects, rather than the usual convective inertia.

==Definitions==
It is defined as:

:formula_1

- where &quot;D&quot; is a characteristic (usually vertical) length scale of a phenomenon; &quot;ν&quot;, the kinematic eddy viscosity; Ω, the angular velocity of planetary rotation; and φ, the latitude. The term 2 Ω sin φ is the Coriolis frequency.
It is given in terms of the kinematic viscosity, &quot;ν&quot;; the angular velocity, Ω; and a characteristic length scale, &quot;L&quot;.

There do appear to be some differing conventions in the literature.

Tritton gives:

:formula_2

In contrast, the NRL Plasma Formulary gives:

:formula_3

where Ro is the Rossby number and Re is the Reynolds number.

These equations can generally not be used in oceanography. An estimation of the viscous terms of Navier-Stokes equation (with eventually the Eddy Viscosity) and of the Coriolis terms needs to be done.

<text>Alfa Laval AB is a Swedish company, founded in 1883 by Gustaf de Laval and Oscar Lamm. The company started by providing centrifuges to dairies to be used to separate cream from milk. It now deals in the production of specialised products for heavy industry. The products are used to heat, cool, separate and transport such products as oil, water, chemicals, beverages, foodstuffs, starch and pharmaceuticals.

Alfa Laval is headquartered in Lund, Sweden and has subsidiary companies in over 100 countries around the world, including South Africa, Denmark, Italy, India, Japan, China, Netherlands, and the United States. As of the end of 2021, Alfa Laval had a global workforce of 18,574 employees and revenue of $4.77 billion.

==Company structure and end-markets==
Alfa Laval is a heavy industry company that focuses on the large-scale operations, such as the Marine, Energy, Food &amp; Water industries.

===Alfa Laval Marine division===

Alfa Laval manufactures valves, pumps, heat exchangers, evaporators, distillers, oil separators, filters, ballast water treatment systems, and all other hardware vital to the operation of the a ship&#x27;s engine room. As of 2011, Alfa Laval consolidated its Marine, Offshore, and Diesel divisions into one, Marine &amp; Diesel, division in an effort to simplify logistics and administration of its marine wing to better serve maritime industry.

Alfa Laval’s Marine division works with end-markets in shipbuilding, offshore oil and gas, and diesel &amp; gas-engine power. The division also develops technology to help marine customers comply with environmental regulations. Product areas include marine separation and heat transfer equipment, boilers and gas systems, and pumping systems.

In 2014, Alfa Laval acquired marine pump manufacturer Framo AS. It was Alfa Laval’s largest acquisition to that point, in order to further expanded the company’s offering of marine equipment.

In 2021, Alfa Laval acquired StormGeo, a weather analysis software provider for NOK 3.63 billion ($440 million). The use of StormGeo&#x27;s digital products is increasing the decarbonisation of the industry; since 2018, their use has saved carriers 2.1 million tonnes of fuel, reducing CO2 emissions by 6.2 million tonnes.

Also part of the strategy to expand digital services for offshore vessels was the acquisition in 2022 of Danish company BunkerMetric, a developer of advanced decision support tools for offshore bunker vessels. The use of tools from both solutions will help optimise and improve the efficiency of maritime carriers. BunkerMetric&#x27;s procurement optimisation tool will be part of the subscription of StormGeo&#x27;s existing offering.

===Alfa Laval Energy division===
Alfa Laval’s Energy division has a long track record working with end-markets in oil &amp; gas drilling and production, oil &amp; gas and renewable fuel processing &amp; transportation, oil refineries, and the petrochemicals industry. Other areas include HVAC applications, district heating and district cooling, power generation, engine cooling, pulp, paper, municipal and industrial waste treatment and recycling, bio-based material, mining and minerals. Product areas include heat exchanger and industrial scale centrifugal separation technologies.

===Alfa Laval Food &amp; Water division===
Alfa Laval’s Food &amp; Water division works with end-markets in food manufacturing, dairy, pharmaceuticals, ethanol, starch, sugar, municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater treatment, proteins, biotech, vegetable oils, and breweries. Product areas include high speed separators, food systems, food heat transfer, decanters, and hygienic fluid handling technologies.

In 2022, Alfa Laval acquired Desmet, part of the Desmet Ballestra, a world leader in engineering and supplying processing plants and technologies for edible oils and biofuel sectors. This acquisition is to support Alfa Laval&#x27;s transformation towards renewable fuels.

==History==
===Origins and early expansion===
Alfa Laval was founded as AB Separator by Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval and engineer Oscar Lamm in Stockholm in 1883. The De Laval Cream Separator Co., an American subsidiary, was founded the same year.

The company’s origin was de Laval’s invention of a continuous milk separator, which he and Lamm had first patented in 1878. Prior to this, dairy producers manually skimmed cream from milk, which was laborious and time-consuming. Capable of handling up to 130 litres per hour, de Laval’s centrifugal separator made this process easier and more efficient.

In 1888, AB Separator also began selling pumps to transport skimmed milk from the separator. In 1890, AB Separator introduced the first continuous separator with disc stacks featuring conical metal discs called Alfa Discs, which increased the separation capacity.

AB Separator was a privately held company until 1901, when it was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The company continued to expand internationally in the early 1900s, opening subsidiaries in Denmark, South Africa, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ireland by 1936.

In 1938, AB Separator began manufacturing its first heat exchanger. These were produced in Lund, Sweden, where later became the company’s headquarter.

===Name and ownership changes===
In 1963, AB Separator changed its name to Alfa-Laval AB, combining the name of the company’s founder with a reference to the Alfa Disc technology in its separators.

In 1991, the company returned to private ownership after it was acquired by the Swedish packaging group Tetra Pak. It was then renamed Alfa Laval AB and made into an independent industrial group within the newly formed Tetra Laval Group.

Tetra Laval sold a majority stake of Alfa Laval to the Swedish private equity group Industri Kapital (now known as IK Investment Partners) in 2000, who purchased the company with the intention of listing it publicly within a five-year period. Alfa Laval returned to the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2002. As of 2019, Tetra Laval has retained a 29.1% minority stake in the company.

==International operations==
Manufacturing at Alfa Laval is carried out in several countries including Sweden, India, China, the UK, and USA.
As of 2022, Alfa Laval has over forty manufacturing units globally and holds more than 2,000 patents.

===Canada===
In Canada, Alfa Laval has had a presence for over 100 years, previously as DeLaval, which would provide such services to farmers as assisting them in the storage of their milk and providing cream separators. Alfa Laval is headquartered in Toronto and in 2009 opened a service centre in Edmonton, Alberta. In late 2010, staff in the Canadian operations numbered 74.

===United States===
Alfa Laval has been present in the United States of America for more than 130 years—marketing and supplying a broad range of heat exchangers, separators, decanters, pumps, tank cleaning devices, valves and fittings to customers in a wide range of market segments.

===United Kingdom===
Alfa Laval&#x27;s head office in UK is located in Camberley, Surrey. Their pumps and manufacturing division was located in Eastbourne before closing in 2023, with further sales office in Birmingham.

==Sustainability partnerships==

Much of Alfa Laval’s current development is focused on technologies for improving energy efficiency to reduce carbon emissions, meeting marine environmental regulations, and providing cleaner water. The company is also a participant in a number of global partnerships for improving sustainability.

In 2018, Alfa Laval became a part-owner in Malta, Inc., for which they also supply heat transfer technologies. Incubated at X Development (formerly Google X), Malta Inc. is developing a new thermal energy storage solution that will enable the shift to renewable energy sources.

Also in 2021, Alfa Laval and Wallenius Marine formed a joint venture called AlfaWall Oceanbird. The partnership aims to supply wind propulsion solutions for the shipping industry, in order to reduce emissions.

<doc id="476361" wikidata="Q1654461" url="?curid=476361" title="IRIS GL">
<text>IRIS GL (Integrated Raster Imaging System Graphics Library) is a proprietary graphics API created by Silicon Graphics (SGI) in the early 1980s for producing 2D and 3D computer graphics on their IRIX-based IRIS graphical workstations. Later SGI removed their proprietary code, reworked various system calls, and released IRIS GL as the industry standard OpenGL.

== History ==
In 1982, SGI began development of IRIS GL. It soon became much more popular than the ANSI standard PHIGS, as developers considered it more intuitive and flexible. In the years after 1982, IRIS GL began licensing it to many companies, including IBM. Fragmentation soon became an issue with IRIS GL&#x27;s popularity, in the implementations and a much bigger one with many different windowing systems. In 1985, the X window system came around, and finally there was a somewhat common system. The system was also more transparent, and more reliable.

Soon another competitor came along from Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment Corporation, relying on the X window system. It was technically called X3D, though soon became more commonly known as PHIGS Extension To X (PEX). By the late 1980&#x27;s, full implementations were avaliable. Around that time, developers that used IRIS GL wanted an unfragmented open graphics standard from SGI, because they had to support as many devices as possible.

In 1989, to comply with the demands and not be replaced, SGI started development of OpenGL. Two years later, the OpenGL ARB was formed with people from many different companies. In June 1992, the OpenGL 1.0 specification was released, with support for as many applications as possible. To avoid namespace conflicts, every function was prefixed with &quot;gl&quot;. Unlike PEX, the window system dependent parts were removed. Many other parts were cleaned up, removed, or renamed.

<doc id="476364" wikidata="Q3244134" url="?curid=476364" title="Anal retentiveness">
<text>Anal retentiveness is a personality trait that is characterized by excessive concern with details. The concept originated in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, where one aspect of the anal stage of psychosexual development is pleasure in the retention of feces. Fixation in this stage can potentially result in a personality marked by frugality, obstinacy and orderliness. Despite its psychoanalytic roots and the literal meaning of the words, in common usage the term generally refers merely to certain kinds of obsessive behaviour.

==Origins==
In Freudian psychology, the anal stage is said to follow the oral stage of infant or early-childhood development, and occurs from around the age of 18 months to 3 years old. The infant&#x27;s attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation, usually synchronous with learning to control its excretory functions. Freud posited that children who experience conflicts during this stage may develop certain fixations or personality traits. If the association of the libido with the anal erogenous zone and excretory function is not satisfactorily resolved (for example, as a result of the child being too frequently or severely chastised for toilet training accidents), so-called &#x27;anal retentive&#x27; character traits, such as excessive orderliness, stubbornness, and compulsions for control, may develop at a later stage. If excretory pleasure is overindulged during this period the individual may develop &quot;anal-expulsive&quot; personality traits.

==Influence==
Freud&#x27;s theories on early childhood have been influential on the psychological community; the phrase &quot;anal retentive&quot; and the term &quot;anal&quot; survive in common usage. The second edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM-II) introduced obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), with a definition based on Freud&#x27;s description of anal-retentive personality. According to Kathleen Berger, writing in the year 2000, there is no conclusive research linking anal stage conflicts with &quot;anal&quot; personality types.

<text>Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (born Cecilia Helena Payne; – ) was a British and American astronomer and astrophysicist. In her 1925 doctoral thesis she proposed that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. 

Her groundbreaking conclusion was initially rejected by leading astrophysicists, including Henry Norris Russell, because it contradicted the science of the time, which held that no significant elemental differences distinguished the Sun and Earth. Independent observations eventually proved that she was correct. 

Overcoming barriers for female scientists – Payne did not receive a degree from Cambridge despite completing her studies – her work on the cosmic makeup of the universe and the nature of variable stars was foundational to modern astrophysics. She was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society while still a student at Cambridge and later became the first recipient of the American Astronomical Society’s prestigious Annie J. Cannon award. Her success also opened the door for countless female astronomers, including her Harvard colleague, Helen Sawyer Hogg, and in 1956, she was appointed Harvard’s first female Professor and female Department Chair.

==Early life==
Cecilia Helena Payne, born in Wendover in Buckinghamshire, England, was one of three children to Emma Leonora Helena (née Pertz) and Edward John Payne, a London barrister, historian and musician who had been an Oxford fellow. Her mother came from a Prussian family and had two distinguished uncles, historian Georg Heinrich Pertz and the Swedenborgian writer James John Garth Wilkinson. When Cecilia was four, her father died, leaving her mother to raise the family on her own.

==Education==
Payne began her formal education in Wendover at a private school run by Elizabeth Edwards. When Payne was twelve, her family moved to London to support her brother Humfry&#x27;s education; he later became an archaeologist. Payne initially attended St Mary&#x27;s College, Paddington, where she was unable to study much mathematics or science. In 1918, she transferred to St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, where her music teacher, Gustav Holst, encouraged her to pursue a career in music. However, Payne decided to focus on science. The following year she won a scholarship covering her expenses at Newnham College, Cambridge University, where she studied physics and chemistry. 

Her interest in astronomy began after she attended a lecture by Arthur Eddington, detailing his 1919 expedition to the island of Príncipe in the Gulf of Guinea off the west coast of Africa to observe and photograph the stars near a solar eclipse as a test of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. She said of the lecture: &quot;The result was a complete transformation of my world picture. [...] My world had been so shaken that I experienced something very like a nervous breakdown.&quot; Although she completed her studies, she did not receive an official degree, because Cambridge did not grant degrees to women until 1948.

Payne realized that her only career option in the U.K. was to become a teacher, so she looked for grants that would enable her to move to the United States. LJ (Leslie John) Comrie, an astronomy PhD candidate at Cambridge University, introduced her to Harlow Shapley, the Director of the Harvard College Observatory, after a lecture in London at the British Astronomical Association. In 1923, Payne moved to the United States to study at Harvard College, enabled by a fellowship established to encourage women to study at the Harvard Observatory. Adelaide Ames had been the first recipient of this fellowship in 1922, with Payne following as the second. Lawrence H. Aller later described Payne as one of the &quot;most capable go-getters&quot; in Shapley&#x27;s observatory.

===Doctoral thesis===
Shapley persuaded Payne to write a doctoral dissertation, and so in 1925 she became the first person to earn a PhD in astronomy from Radcliffe College of Harvard University. Her thesis title was &quot;Stellar Atmospheres; A Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars&quot;.While analyzing glass plates at the Harvard College Observatory, Payne made a groundbreaking discovery by accurately relating the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures using Indian physicist Meghnad Saha&#x27;s ionization theory. She demonstrated that the great variation in stellar absorption lines was due to differing amounts of ionization at different temperatures, not to varying amounts of elements. Payne found that silicon, carbon, and several common metals seen in the Sun&#x27;s spectrum were present in about the same relative amounts as on Earth, which aligned with the prevailing belief that stars had a similar elemental composition as on Earth. However, she also found that helium, and particularly hydrogen, were vastly more abundant in stars, with hydrogen being about a million times more prevalent, leading her to conclude that hydrogen was the overwhelming constituent of stars, making it the most abundant element in the Universe.

However, when Payne&#x27;s dissertation was reviewed, Henry Norris Russell, a pre-eminent astronomer of the day who adhered to the theories of American physicist Henry Rowland, urged her not to assert that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen because it contradicted the scientific consensus of the time that the elemental composition of the Sun and the Earth were similar. Russell, in a 1914 article, had argued that: 
The agreement of the solar and terrestrial lists is such as to confirm very strongly Rowland&#x27;s opinion that, if the Earth&#x27;s crust should be raised to the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, it would give a very similar absorption spectrum. The spectra of the Sun and other stars were similar, so it appeared that the relative abundance of elements in the universe was like that in Earth&#x27;s crust.

Consequently, Russell described her results as &quot;spurious&quot;. Although she included all calculations and results, Payne agreed to write in her thesis that her results were &quot;almost certainly not real.&quot;

Four years later, however, Russell realized that Payne had been correct when he derived the same results by different means, effectively demonstrating that hydrogen and helium were the most abundant elements in the Milky Way. Sharing his results in 1929, Russell briefly acknowledged Payne&#x27;s earlier work and discovery, including the mention that &quot;[t]he most important previous determination of the abundance of the elements by astrophysical means is that by Miss Payne [...]&quot;. Nevertheless, Russell was generally credited for the conclusions she had reached four years prior.

Nearly 40 years after Payne&#x27;s thesis was published, astronomer Otto Struve described her work as &quot;the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy&quot;. Today&#x27;s accepted ratios for hydrogen and helium in the Milky Way Galaxy are ~74% hydrogen and ~24% helium, confirming the results of Payne-Gaposchkin&#x27;s calculations from 1925.

==Career==

After earning her doctorate in 1925, Payne remained at Harvard for the entirety of her academic career. Initially, women were barred from becoming professors at Harvard, so she spent years doing less prestigious, low-paid research jobs. Her early work focused on stars of high luminosity to understand the structure of the Milky Way. Later she surveyed all stars brighter than the tenth magnitude. She then studied variable stars, making over 1,250,000 observations with her assistants. This work later was extended to the Magellanic Clouds, adding a further 2,000,000 observations of variable stars. 

These data were used to determine the paths of stellar evolution. She published her conclusions in her second book, &quot;The Stars of High Luminosity&quot; (1930). On a tour through Europe in 1933, Payne met Russian-born astrophysicist in Germany. She helped him obtain a visa to the United States, where they married in March 1934. Her observations and analysis of variable stars, carried out with Sergei Gaposchkin, laid the basis for all subsequent work on such objects.

Her work resulted in several published books, including &quot;The Stars of High Luminosity&quot; (1930), &quot;Variable Stars&quot; (1938) and &quot;Variable Stars and Galactic Structure&quot; (1954). Harlow Shapley (the Director of the Harvard College Observatory) had made efforts to improve her position, and in 1938 she was given the title of &quot;Astronomer&quot;. On Payne&#x27;s request, her title was later changed to Phillips Astronomer, an endowed position which would make her an &quot;officer of the university&quot;; in order to get approval for her title, Shapley assured the university that giving Payne-Gaposchkin this position would not make her equivalent to a professor, but privately pushed for the position to be later converted into an explicit professorship as the &quot;Phillips Professor of Astronomy&quot;. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1943. Her courses were not recorded in the Harvard University catalogue until 1945.

When Donald Menzel became Director of the Harvard College Observatory in 1954, he tried to improve her appointment, and in 1956 she became the first woman to be promoted to full professor from within the faculty at Harvard&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. She was appointed the Phillips Professor of Astronomy in 1958. Later, with her appointment to the Chair of the Department of Astronomy, she also became the first woman to head a department at Harvard.[14]

Her students included Joseph Ashbrook, Frank Drake, Harlan Smith and Paul W. Hodge, all of whom made important contributions to astronomy. She also supervised Helen Sawyer Hogg, Frank Kameny and Owen Gingerich.

Payne-Gaposchkin retired from active teaching in 1966 and was subsequently appointed Professor Emerita of Harvard. She continued her research as a member of staff at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, as well as editing the journals and books published by Harvard Observatory for ten years. She edited and published the lectures of Walter Baade as &quot;Evolution of Stars and Galaxies&quot; (1963).

==Legacy==
Payne-Gaposchkin&#x27;s career marked a turning point at Harvard College Observatory. Under the direction of Harlow Shapley and Dr. E. J. Sheridan (whom Payne-Gaposchkin described as a mentor), the observatory had already offered more opportunities in astronomy to women than did other institutions. This was evident in the achievements accomplished earlier in the century by Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, Annie Jump Cannon, and Henrietta Swan Leavitt. However, with Payne&#x27;s PhD, women entered the mainstream.

The trail she blazed into the largely male-dominated scientific community was an inspiration to many. For example, she became a role model for astrophysicist Joan Feynman. Feynman&#x27;s mother and grandmother had dissuaded her from pursuing science, since they believed women were not physically capable of understanding scientific concepts. Feynman was inspired by Payne-Gaposchkin when she came across her work in an astronomy textbook. Seeing Payne-Gaposchkin&#x27;s published research convinced Feynman that she could, in fact, follow her scientific passions.

While accepting the Henry Norris Russell Prize from the American Astronomical Society, Payne spoke of her lifelong passion for research: &quot;The reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the first person in the history of the world to see something or understand something. Nothing can compare with that experience [...] The reward of the old scientist is the sense of having seen a vague sketch grow into a masterly landscape.&quot;

==Personal life==
In her autobiography, Payne said that while in school she created an experiment on the efficacy of prayer by dividing her exams in two groups, praying for success only on one, the other one being a control group. She achieved the higher marks in the latter group. Later on, she became an agnostic.

In 1931, Payne became a United States citizen, so held joint citizenship of both the UK and the US. On a tour through Europe in 1933, she met Russian-born astrophysicist in Germany. She helped him get a visa to the United States, and they married in March 1934, settling in the historic town of Lexington, Massachusetts, a short commute from Harvard. Payne added her husband&#x27;s name to her own, and the Payne-Gaposchkins had three children: Edward, Katherine, and Peter. Payne&#x27;s daughter remembers her as &quot;an inspired seamstress, an inventive knitter, and a voracious reader&quot;. Payne and her family were members of the First Unitarian Church in Lexington, where Cecilia taught Sunday school. 
She was also active with the Quakers. 

She died at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 7, 1979, aged 79. Shortly before her death, Payne had her autobiography privately printed as &quot;The Dyer&#x27;s Hand&quot;. It was later reprinted as &quot;Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin: An Autobiography and Other Recollections&quot;.

Payne&#x27;s younger brother, Humfry Payne (1902–1936), who married author and film critic Dilys Powell, became director of the British School of Archaeology at Athens, where he died in 1936, aged 34. Payne&#x27;s granddaughter, Cecilia Gaposchkin, is a professor of late medieval cultural history and French history at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire.

<text>Manfred Mohr (born June 8, 1938 in Pforzheim/Germany) is a German artist considered to be a pioneer in the field of digital art. He has lived and worked in New York since 1981.

==Life and career==
Mohr started his career as an action painter and jazz musician. He began using a computer in 1969 because of a growing interest in creating algorithmic art. He lived in Barcelona in 1962 and in Paris between 1963 and 1983.

His early computer works are algorithmic and based on his former drawings with a strong attitude on rhythm and repetition. In 1990 he was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica (Golden Nica) at the Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria. He maintained an art studio in Paris from 1963 to 1983. Mohr attended Kunst + Werkschule in Pforzheim and École des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

In 1968 he co-founded the seminar &quot;Art et Informatique&quot; at the University of Vincennes and in May 1971 had a solo exhibit at ARC - Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. That exhibition has become known historically as the first solo show in a museum of works entirely calculated and drawn by a digital computer.

Recent solo exhibitions of his work include Art Basel &quot;Art Features&quot; with bitforms gallery in Basel, DAM Gallery in Berlin, Mueller-Roth Gallery in Stuttgart, Carroll / Fletcher Gallery in London, bitforms gallery in New York City, Galerie Charlot in Paris, the Museum of Kulturspeicher in Würzburg, and Galerie Wack in Kaiserslautern.

Major retrospectives of his work include ZKM | Media Museum in Karlsruhe in 2013, the Kunsthalle in Bremen in 2007, Joseph Albers Museum in Bottrop, Germany in 1998, and the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum in Ludwigshafen, Germany in 1987.

Mohr&#x27;s work is collected by the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Joseph Albers Museum, the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, the Museum for Concret Art in Ingolstadt, the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart, Musee d’Art Contemporain and Musée des Beaux-Arts in Montreal, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Musée de l&#x27;Élysée in Switzerland, and many others. Mohr has had numerous solo exhibitions in both museums and galleries in New York, Zürich, Cologne, Paris, Amsterdam, Stuttgart, Berlin, Montreal, São Paulo, and Seoul. Additionally, he has participated in group exhibitions at the Leo Castelli Gallery and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Mohr has received many awards including the 2013 ACM SIGGRAPH Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement in Digital Art, 2006 (ddaa) Digital Art Award Cologne/Berlin, a fellowship from New York Foundation for the Arts in 1997, the 1990 Golden Nica from Ars Electronica in Linz, the 1990 Camille Graeser Prize in Zürich, and the 1973 Ljubljana Print Biennial. In 1994, the first comprehensive monograph on his work was published by Waser-Verlag in Zürich.

<text>Tamas (Sanskrit: तमस् &quot;tamas&quot;, ) is one of the three &quot;guṇas&quot; (tendencies, qualities, attributes), a philosophical and psychological concept developed by the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The other two qualities are &quot;rajas&quot; (passion and activity) and &quot;sattva&quot; (purity, goodness). &quot;Tamas&quot; is the quality of inertia, inactivity, dullness, or lethargy. Generally it is referred to as the lowest &quot;guṇa&quot; of the three.

==Etymology==
The Vedic word &quot;támas&quot; refers to &quot;darkness.&quot; The Indo-European word &quot;*temH-es&quot;, means &quot;dark&quot;, and the Lithuanian word &quot;tamsa&quot;, mean &quot;darkness.&quot;
Serbian word &quot;tama&quot; means &quot;darkness&quot;.

==Hinduism==
In Samkhya philosophy, a is one of three &quot;tendencies, qualities&quot;: &quot;sattva&quot;, &quot;rajas&quot; and &quot;tamas&quot;. This category of qualities have been widely adopted by various schools of Hinduism for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. The three qualities are:

* &quot;Sattva&quot; is the quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, universalizing, holistic, positive, peaceful, virtuous.
* &quot;Rajas&quot; is the quality of passion, activity, being driven, moving, dynamic.
* &quot;Tamas&quot; is the quality of dullness or inactivity, apathy, inertia or lethargy.

Action that is virtuous, thought through, free from attachment, and without craving for results is considered Sattvic. Action that is driven purely by craving for pleasure, selfishness and much effort is Rajasic. Action that is undertaken because of delusion, disregarding consequences, without considering loss or injury to others or self, is called Tamasic.

— Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, verses 23–25 [31]

In Indian philosophy, these qualities are not considered as present in either-or fashion. Rather, everyone and everything has all three, only in different proportions and in different contexts. The living being or substance is viewed as the net result of the joint effect of these three qualities.

According to the Samkya school, no one and nothing is either purely Sattvic, Rajasic or Tamasic. One&#x27;s nature and behavior is a complex interplay of all &quot;guṇas&quot; in varying degrees. In some, the conduct is Rajasic with significant influence of Sattvic &quot;guṇa;&quot; in some it is Rajasic with significant influence of Tamasic &quot;guṇa&quot;, and so on.

==Sikhism==
The Sikh scripture refers to &quot;tamas&quot; in its verses:
*&quot;The Fourteenth Day: one who enters into the fourth state, overcomes time, and the three qualities of &quot;rajas&quot;, &quot;tamas&quot;, and &quot;sattva&quot;.&quot; (SGGS )
*&quot;Those who embody the energies of &quot;sattva&quot;-white light, &quot;rajas&quot;-red passion, and &quot;tamas&quot;-black darkness, abide in the Fear of God, along with the many created forms.&quot; (SGGS )
*&quot;Your Power is diffused through the three gunas: &quot;rajas&quot;, &quot;tamas&quot; and &quot;sattva&quot;.&quot; (SGGS )
*&quot;&quot;Rajas&quot;, the quality of energy and activity; &quot;tamas&quot;, the quality of darkness and inertia; and &quot;sattva&quot;, the quality of purity and light, are all called the creations of Maya, Your illusion. That man who realizes the fourth state – he alone obtains the supreme state.&quot; (SGGS )

<doc id="476378" wikidata="Q1477129" url="?curid=476378" title="Seeress (Germanic)">
<text>In Germanic paganism, a seeress is a woman said to have the ability to foretell future events and perform sorcery. They are also referred to with many other names meaning &quot;prophetess&quot;, &quot;staff bearer&quot; and &quot;sorceress&quot;, and they are frequently called &quot;witches&quot; both in early sources and in modern scholarship. In Norse mythology the seeress is usually referred to as &quot;völva&quot; or &quot;vala&quot;.

Seeresses were an expression of the pre-Christian shamanic traditions of Europe, and they held an authoritative position in Germanic society. Mentions of Germanic seeresses occur as early as the Roman era, when, for example, they at times led armed resistance against Roman rule and acted as envoys to Rome. After the Roman Era, seeresses occur in records among the North Germanic people, where they form a reoccurring motif in Norse mythology. Both the classical and the Norse accounts imply that they used wands, and describe them as sitting on raised platforms during séances.

Ancient Roman and Greek literature records the name of several Germanic seeresses, including Albruna, Veleda, Ganna, and, by way of an archaeological find, Waluburg. Norse mythology mentions several seeresses, some of them by name, including Heimlaug völva, Þorbjörg lítilvölva, Þordís spákona, and Þuríðr Sundafyllir. In North Germanic religion, the goddess Freyja has a particular association with seeresses, and there are indications that the Viking princess and Rus&#x27; saint, Olga of Kiev, was one such, serving as a &quot;priestess of Freyja&quot; among the Scandinavian elite in Kievan Rus&#x27; before they converted to Christianity.

Archaeologists have identified several graves that appear to be the remains of Scandinavian seeresses. These graves contain objects such as wands, seeds with hallucinogenic and aphrodisiac properties, and a variety of items indicating high status.

Societal beliefs about the practices and abilities of seeresses would contribute to the development of the European concept of &quot;witches&quot;, because their practices survived Christianization, although the practitioners became marginalized, and evolved into north European mediaeval witchcraft. Germanic seeresses are mentioned in popular culture in a variety of contexts. In Germanic Heathenry, a modern practice of Germanic pagan religion, seeresses once again play a role.

== Names and terminology ==

Aside from the names of individuals, Roman era accounts do not contain information about how the early Germanic peoples referred to them, but sixth century Goth scholar Jordanes reported in his &quot;Getica&quot; that the early Goths had called their seeresses (Goth-Latin). The word also appears in Old English (OE), (&quot;seeress&quot; or &quot;witch&quot;) and in Old High German (OHG) as (&quot;necromancy&quot;) and (&quot;necromancer&quot;), and from these forms an earlier Proto-Germanic form *&quot;χalja-rūnō(n)&quot; has been reconstructed, in which the first element is *&quot;χaljō&quot;, i.e. &quot;Hel&quot;, the abode of the dead, and the second is *&quot;rūnō&quot; (&quot;mystery, secret&quot;). At this time the word *&quot;rūnō&quot; still referred to chanting and not to letters (&quot;rune&quot;), and in the sense &quot;incantation&quot; it was probably borrowed from Proto-Germanic into Finnish where &quot;runo&quot; means &quot;poem&quot;.

In OE, &quot;hellerune&quot; (&quot;seeress&quot; or &quot;witch&quot;), or &quot;helrūne&quot;, has the synonym &quot;&quot;, a term that is also found in Old Dutch, &quot;haghetisse&quot; (&quot;witch&quot;) and in OHG , &quot;hagzussa&quot; or &quot;&quot;. These West Germanic forms are probably derived from a Proto-Germanic word with positive connotations, , from which are also derived Old Norse (ON) &quot;hagr&quot; (&quot;skillful&quot;) and Middle High German (MHG) &quot;be-hac&quot; (&quot;of pleasure&quot;). However, it is sometimes proposed that the first element is a term corresponding to Swedish &quot;hage&quot; (&quot;wooded paddock&quot;) in the sense of &quot;fence&quot;, i.e. PGmc *&quot;χaʒōn&quot; (&quot;pasture&quot;, &quot;enclosure&quot;), from whence also English &quot;hedge&quot; (through *&quot;χaʒjaz&quot;). In that case it would be etymologically related to ON &quot;túnriða&quot; and OHG (&quot;fence rider&quot;), where &quot;tún&quot;/&quot;zûn&quot; does not refer to an enclosure but metonymically to the fence surrounding it. In the &quot;Westrogothic law &quot;, it was a punishable offence to accuse a woman of having ridden a fence-gate, in the appearance (&quot;&quot;) of a troll. Kluge reconstructs the PGmc form as , where the last element *&quot;tusjō&quot; could mean &quot;spirit&quot;, from PIE *-.

The various names in North Germanic sources may give the impression that there were two types of sorceress, the staff-bearers, or seeresses (&quot;vǫlva&quot;), and the women who were named for performing magic (&quot;seiðkona&quot;). However, there is little that the scholar could use to differentiate them, if such a distinction ever existed, and the two types of names are often used synonymously and about the same women.

The term &quot;vǫlva&quot; means &quot;staff bearer&quot; and is related etymologically to the names of the early Germanic seeresses &quot;Ganna&quot;, &quot;Gambara&quot; and &quot;Waluburg&quot;. The use of wands in divination and clairvoyance appears to have lived on from the classical era into the Viking Age. The name &quot;vǫlva&quot; and derivations of the name appear 23 times in the sources, and &quot;seiðkona&quot; (&quot;seiðr woman/wife&quot;) appears eight times; the two terms are often used interchangeably. The second most common term is &quot;spákona&quot; (&quot;prophecy woman/wife&quot;) with the variants &quot;spákerling&quot; (&quot;old prophecy woman&quot;) and &quot;spámey&quot; (&quot;prophecy maiden&quot;), which appears 22 times, again interchangeably with &quot;vǫlva&quot; and &quot;seiðkona&quot; to refer to the same woman. There is also the name &quot;vísendakona&quot; (&quot;knowing woman&quot;), which appears eight times in the sources. Þorbiorg in &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot; is called both a &quot;vísendakona&quot;, &quot;vǫlva&quot; and a &quot;spákona&quot;. It is possible that the names once had different meanings, but at the time of the saga&#x27;s composition, they were no longer distinguished in meaning, just as the words &quot;sorceress&quot; and &quot;witch&quot; are interchangeable in modern popular language. There are also five instances of a group of rarer names having the element &quot;galdr&quot; (&quot;incantation&quot;), with the names &quot;galdrakonur&quot; (&quot;galdr women&quot;), &quot;galdrakerling&quot; (&quot;old galdr woman&quot;) and &quot;galdrasnót&quot; (&quot;galdr lady&quot;). In addition there is the word &quot;galdrakind&quot; (&quot;galdr creature&quot;) with negative connotations.

There is also the reconstructed word *&quot;vitka&quot; which may be connected to the &quot;Wecha&quot; in &quot;Gesta Danorum, book III&quot; and refer to a kind of sorceress. It seems to be the feminine form of &quot;vitki&quot; (&quot;sorcerer&quot;), and it is only attested from &quot;Lokasenna&quot; 24, where Loki accuses Odin of having travelled around the world &quot;vitka líki&quot; (in the &quot;guise of a vitka&quot;).

The personal name &quot;Heiðr&quot; appears 66 times as a word for sorceress in the prose sources. It appears twice in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, in &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; and in &quot;Vǫluspá&quot;, where it is a name assumed by Gullveig in connection with the War of the Gods. In a study by McKinnell of Norse sagas and &quot;Landnámabók&quot;, there is only one instance of a woman named &quot;Heiðr&quot; who does not act as a seeress. The name has been connected to &quot;heath&quot; and &quot;heathen&quot;, but it has also been explained with meanings that connote &quot;radiance and golden light, honour and payment&quot;.

Lastly, there is the term &quot;fjolkyngiskona&quot; that only meant &quot;sorceress&quot;, and a number of derogatory names that correspond to &quot;witch&quot; with many negative connotations, and these terms include &quot;skass&quot; (&quot;ogress&quot;), &quot;flagð(kona)&quot; (&quot;ogress&quot;), &quot;gýgr&quot; (&quot;ogress&quot;), &quot;fála&quot; (&quot;Giantess&quot;), &quot;hála&quot; and &quot;fordæða&quot; (&quot;evil doer&quot;).

=== The term shamanism ===

There has long been an academic debate on whether the seeresses&#x27; practice should be regarded as shamanism. However, this does not pertain to the concept of shamanism in a wider definition (see e.g. the definitions of the OED), but rather to what degree similarities can be found between what is preserved about them in Old Norse literature and the shamanism of northern Eurasia in a more restricted sense. The majority of scholars support the &quot;shamanic interpretation, and the presence of ecstatic rituals&quot; (e.g. Ellis Davidson, Ohlmarks, Pálsson, Meulengracht Sørensen, Turville-Petre and de Vries), while a minority is skeptical (e.g. Bugge, Dillmann, Dumézil, Näsström and Schjødt), but there are divergent opinions within the two camps. Clive Tolley, who is among the sceptics, writes that if shamanism is defined as &quot;tundra shamanism&quot; as represented by the Sámi of Scandinavia and as defined by Edward Vajda, then the differences are too great. He allies himself with the position of Ohlmarks, who was familiar with a wide range shamanism and rejected it in 1939, in a debate with Dag Strömbäck who found similarities with Sámi practices. However, Tolley concedes that if shamanism is defined in line with the words of Åke Hultkrantz (1993) as &quot;[...] direct contact with spiritual beings and guardian spirits, together with the mediating role played by a shaman in a ritual setting [...] The presence of guardian spirits during the trance and following shamanic actions [...]&quot; then it is correct to define their practices as &quot;broadly shamanic&quot;. However, he considers that in this case shamanism also includes traditional practices from a large part of Europe, such as the witchcraft of medieval Europe and the practices of ancient Greece. An opposing view is held by Neil Price, who has studied circumpolar shamanism, and argues that he finds enough similarities to define the North Germanic seeresses as shamans also in the stricter sense.

== Role in society ==

Fate is central in Germanic literature and mythology, and men&#x27;s destiny is inextricably linked to supernatural women and seeresses. Morris comments that the importance of fate can not be overstressed, and the seeresses were feared and revered by gods and mortals alike. Even the god Odin himself consulted them. The Norns are an example of the link between women and fate, which was elevated in Germanic society, and the association was incarnated by the seeresses.

The political role that the seeresses played was always present when the Romans were dealing with the Germanic tribes, and the Romans had to take their opinion into account. Ganna&#x27;s political influence was so considerable that she was taken to Rome together with Masyos, the king of her tribe, where they had an audience with the Roman emperor Domitian and were treated with honours, after which they returned home.
The Roman historian Tacitus, who appears to have met Ganna and to have been informed by her of most of what we know of early Germanic religion, wrote:

Another telling account by Tacitus about their power was a statement by the Batavian tribe to the Romans:

However, the seeresses do not appear to have been just any women, but were those who occupied a special office. Both Mogk and Sundqvist have commented that although the seeresses were referred to as &quot;priestesses&quot; by the Romans, they probably should not be so labelled in a strict sense. As for the later North Germanic version, Näsström writes that the völva did not perform any sacrifices, but her roles as a prophetess and as a sorceress were still important aspects of the spiritual life of her society. Price comments that Katherine Morris has usefully defined these women:
== Attestations ==
Germanic seeresses are first described by the Romans, who discuss the role seeresses played in Germanic society. A gap in the historical record occurs until the North Germanic record began over a millennium later, when the Old Norse sagas frequently mention seeresses among the North Germanic peoples. It is noteworthy that Veleda, who prophesied in a high tower in the first century, finds an echo in the thirteenth-century account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva who prophesied from a raised platform in &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot;. Simek comments that the saga&#x27;s account of Þorbjörg&#x27;s raised platform and her wand conveys authentic practices from Germanic paganism.

=== Roman Era ===

In his ethnography of the ancient Germanic peoples, &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus expounds on some of these points. In chapter eight, he reports the following about women in then-contemporary Germanic society and the role of seeresses:

:It is recorded that some armies that were already wavering and on the point of collapse have been rallied by women pleading steadfastly, blocking their path with bared breasts, and reminding their men how near they themselves are to being taken captive. This they fear by a long way more desperately for their women than for themselves. Indeed, peoples who are ordered to include girls of noble family among their hostages are thereby placed under a more effective restraint. They even believe that there is something holy and an element of the prophetic in women, hence they neither scorn their advice nor ignore their predictions. Under the Deified Vespasian we witnessed how Veleda was long regarded by many of them as a divine being; and in former times, too, they revered Albruna and a number of other women, not through servile flattery nor as if they had to make goddesses out of them.

Writing also in the first century AD, Greek geographer and historian Strabo records the following about the Cimbri, a Germanic people, in chapter 2.3 of volume seven of his encyclopedia &quot;Geographica&quot;:

:Writers report a custom of the Cimbri to this effect: Their wives, who would accompany them on their expeditions, were attended by priestesses who were seers; these were grey-haired, clad in white, with flaxen cloaks fastened on with clasps, girt with girdles of bronze, and bare-footed; now sword in hand these priestesses would meet with the prisoners of war throughout the camp, and having first crowned them with wreaths would lead them to a brazen vessel of about twenty amphorae; and they had a raised platform which the priestess would mount, and then, bending over the kettle, would cut the throat of each prisoner after he had been lifted up; and from the blood that poured forth into the vessel some of the priestesses would draw a prophecy, while still others would split open the body and from an inspection of the entrails would utter a prophecy of victory for their own people; and during the battles they would beat on the hides that were stretched over the wicker-bodies of the wagons and in this way produce an unearthly noise.

Writing in the second century CE, Roman historian Cassius Dio describes in chapter 50 of his &quot;Roman History&quot; an encounter between Nero Claudius Drusus and a woman with supernatural abilities among the Cherusci, a Germanic people. According to Diorites Cassius, the woman foresees Drusus&#x27;s death, and he dies soon thereafter:

:The events related happened in the consulship of Iullus Antonius and Fabius Maximus. In the following year Drusus became consul with Titus Crispinus, and omens occurred that were anything but favourable to him. Many buildings were destroyed by storm and by thunderbolts, among them any temples; even that of Jupiter Capitolinus and the gods worshipped with him was injured. Drusus, however, paid no heed to any of these things, but invaded the country of the Chatti and advanced as far as that of the Suebi, conquering with difficulty the territory traversed and defeating the forces that attacked him only after considerable bloodshed. From there he proceeded to the country of the Cherusci, and crossing the Visurgis, advanced as far as the Albis, pillaging everything on his way.
:The Albis rises in the Vandalic Mountains, and empties, a mighty river, into the northern ocean. Drusus undertook to cross this river, but failing in the attempt, set up trophies and withdrew. For a woman of superhuman size met him and said: &quot;Whither, pray, art thou hastening, insatiable Drusus? It is not fated that thou shalt look upon all these lands. But depart; for the end alike of thy labours and of thy life is already at hand&quot;.
:It is indeed marvellous that such a voice should have come to any man from the Deity, yet I cannot discredit the tale; for Drusus immediately departed, and as he was returning in haste, died on the way of some disease before reaching the Rhine. And I find confirmation of the story in these incidents: wolves were prowling about the camp and howling just before his death; two youths were seen riding through the midst of the camp; a sound as of women lamenting was heard; and there were shooting stars in the sky. So much for these events.
==== Albruna ====
==== Veleda ====

In the first and second centuries CE, Greek and Roman authors—such as Greek historian Strabo, Roman senator Tacitus, and Roman historian Cassius Dio—wrote about the ancient Germanic peoples, and made note of the role of seeresses in Germanic society. Tacitus mentions Germanic seeresses in book 4 of his first century CE &quot;Histories&quot;.

:The legionary commander Munius Lupercus was sent along with other presents to Veleda, an unmarried woman who enjoyed wide influence over the tribe of the Bructeri. The Germans traditionally regard many of the female sex as prophetic, and indeed, by an excess of superstition, as divine. This was a case in point. Veleda&#x27;s prestige stood high, for she had foretold the German successes and the extermination of the legions. But Lupercus was put to death before he reached her.
==== Ganna ====
A seeress named &quot;Ganna&quot; is mentioned by the Roman historiographer Cassius Dio in the early 3rd century. The context is the campaign east of the Rhine by Emperor Domitian in the 80s of the 1st century CE. Ganna belonged to a tribe called the &quot;Semnones&quot; who were settled east of the river Elbe, and she appears to have been active in the second half of the 1st century, after Veleda&#x27;s time. Ganna&#x27;s political influence was considerable enough that she was taken to Rome together with Masyos, the king of her tribe, where they had an audience with the Roman emperor and were treated with honours, after which they returned home. This probably happened in 86 AD, the year after his final war with the Chatti, when he made a treaty with the Cherusci, who were settled between the rivers Weser and the Elbe.

During their stay in Rome, Ganna and Masyos appear also to have met with the Roman historian Tacitus who reports that he discussed the Semnoni religious practices with informants from that tribe, who considered themselves the noblest of the Suebi. Bruce Lincoln (1986) discusses Tacitus&#x27; meeting with Ganna and what the Roman historian learnt of the mythological traditions of the early Germanic tribes, and of the Semnoni&#x27;s ancestral relationships with the other tribes from &quot;Ing&quot; (Yngvi), &quot;Ist&quot; and &quot;Irmin&quot; (Odin), the sons of Mannus, the son of Tuisto. The Semnoni reenacted the &quot;horrific origins&quot; of their nation with a human sacrifice, with each victim representing Tuisto (the &quot;twin&quot;) and being cut up to repeat the &quot;acts of creation&quot;, which can be compared to how Odin and his brothers cut up the body of the primordial giant Ymir (the &quot;twin&quot;) to form the world in Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek notes that Tacitus also learnt that the Semnoni performed their rites at a holy grove that was the cradle of the tribe&#x27;s inception, and that could only be entered when they were fettered. The god who was worshiped was probably Odin, and being fettered may have been an imitation of Odin&#x27;s self-sacrifice. This grove has for a long time been identified with the Grove of Fetters, where the hero was sacrificed to Odin in the Eddic poem, &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;.

It is notable that Ganna is not referred to as a &quot;sibylla&quot;, but as a &quot;theiázousa&quot; in Greek, which means &quot;someone making prophesies&quot;. Her name &quot;Ganna&quot; is usually interpreted as Proto-Germanic &quot;Gan-no&quot; and compared with Old Norse &quot;gandr&quot; in the meaning &quot;magical staff&quot; (for the meanings of &quot;gan&quot;- and &quot;gandr&quot;, see the section on magical &quot;Projection&quot;); Ganna would mean the &quot;one who carries the magical staff&quot; or &quot;she who controls the magical staff&quot; or something similar. Her name is thus grouped with other seeresses with staff names, like Gambara (&quot;wand-bearer&quot;) and Waluburg from &quot;walu&quot;-, &quot;staff&quot; (ON &quot;vǫlr&quot;), and the same word is found in the name of North Germanic seeresses, the &quot;vǫlur&quot;. Simek analyses &quot;gandr&quot; as a &quot;magic staff&quot; and the &quot;insignia of her calling&quot;, but in a later work he adds that it meant &quot;magic object or being&quot; and instead of referring to a wand as her tool or insignia, her name may instead have been a reference to her function among the Germanic tribes (like Veleda&#x27;s name). Sundqvist suggests that the name may have referred instead to her abilities, like de Vries who connects her name directly to the ablaut grade &quot;ginn&quot;- (&quot;magical ability&quot;), also treated further down in the section on magical &quot;Projection&quot;.

==== Waluburg ====
Dating from the second century CE, an ostracon with a Greek inscription reading &quot;Waluburg. Se[m]noni Sibylla&quot; (Greek &#x27;Waluburg, sibyl from the Semnones&#x27;) was discovered in the early twentieth century on Elephantine, an Egyptian island. The name occurs among a list of Roman and Graeco-Egyptian soldier names, perhaps indicating its use as a payroll.

The first element *- is probably Proto-Germanic * &#x27;staff&#x27;, which could be a reference to the seeresses&#x27; insignia, the magic staff, and which connects her name semantically to that of her fellow tribeswoman, the seeress Ganna, who probably taught her the craft and who had an audience with emperor Domitian in Rome. In the same way, her name may also be connected to the name of another Germanic seeress, Gambara, which can be interpreted as &#x27;staff bearer&#x27; (* or *), see . The staffs are also reflected in the North Germanic word for seeress, &#x27;staff bearer&#x27;. In North Germanic accounts, the seeresses were always equipped with a staff, a &quot;vǫlr&quot;, from the same Proto-Germanic root *.

Schubart proposes that she may have been a war prisoner accompanying a Roman soldier in his career that led to him being stationed in Egypt at the first cataract. Simek considers her to have been deported by the Roman authorities, and he writes that it is uncertain how she arrived at Elephantine, but it is not surprising considering the significant and obvious influence that the Germanic seeresses wielded politically. Clement of Alexandria who lived in Egypt at the same time as Waluburg, and the earlier Plutarch, mentioned that the Germanic seeresses also could predict the future while studying the eddies, the whirling and the splashing of currents, and Schubart suggests that this is the reason why Waluburg found herself at the swirling waters of the First Cataract of the Nile.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
==== Gambara ====
The &quot;Origo Gentis Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;Origin of the Lombard/Langobard people&quot;), a seventh-century Latin account, and the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Lombard/Langobards&quot;), from the 8th c., relate the legend that before, or after, the Langobard people, then known as the Winnili, emigrated from Scandinavia, led by the brothers Ibor and Agio, their neighbours, the Vandals, demanded that they pay tribute, but their mother Gambara advised them not to. Before the battle, the Vandals called on Odin (&quot;Godan&quot;) to give them victory, but Gambara invoked Odin&#x27;s wife Frigg (&quot;Frea&quot;) instead. Frigg advised them to trick Odin, by having the Winnili women spread their hair in front of their faces so as to look bearded and stand before the window from which Odin looked down on Earth. Odin was embarrassed and asked who the &quot;long-beards&quot; (&quot;longobarbae&quot;) were, and thus naming them he became their godfather and had to grant them victory.

Gambara is called &quot;phitonissa&quot; in Latin which means &quot;priestess&quot; or &quot;sorceress&quot;, and in the &quot;Chronicum Gothanum&quot;, she is also specifically called &quot;sibylla&quot;, i.e. &quot;seeress&quot;. Pohl comments that Gambara lived in a world and era where prophecy was important, and not being a virgin like Veleda, she combined the roles of priestess, wise woman, mother and queen. Her name may mean &quot;wand-bearer&quot; (*&quot;gand-bera&quot; or *&quot;gand-bara&quot;) with the same meaning as Old Norse &quot;vǫlva&quot;, while the name of her son &quot;Ibor&quot; means &quot;boar&quot;, the animal sacred to the Norse god Freyr, the god of fertility and the main god of the Vanir clan of the gods. Hauck argues that the legend goes back to a time when the early Lombards primarily worshiped the mother goddess Freyja, as part of the Scandinavian Vanir worship, and he adds that a Lombard counterpart of Uppsala has been discovered in Žuráň, near Brno in the modern day Czech republic.

In Lombard, Odin and Frigg were called &quot;Godan&quot; and &quot;Frea&quot;, while they were called &quot;Uodan&quot; and &quot;Friia&quot; in Old High German and &quot;Woden&quot; and &quot;Frig&quot; in Old English. The window from which Odin looked down on earth recalls the &quot;Hliðskjálf&quot; of Norse mythology, from where he could see everything, and where Frigg also conspires against Odin in the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, in a parallel with the Lombard myth. Frigg&#x27;s infidelity and connection with prophecy normally belong to Freyja, and her association with magic (&quot;seiðr&quot;), but there are many similarities between them, and Freyja and Frigg may originally have been the same goddess. Scholars may identify Frea as Frigg/Freyja, or simply as Freyja.

==== Haliurunas ====
&quot;Getica&quot;, a 6th century work on the history of the Goths, reports that the early Goths had called their seeresses &quot;haliurunas&quot; (or &quot;haliurunnae&quot;, etc.) (Goth-Latin). They were in the words of Wolfram &quot;women who engaged in magic with the world of the dead&quot;, and they were banished from their tribe by Filimer who was the last pre-Amal dynasty king of the migrating Goths. They found refuge in the wilderness where they were impregnated by unclean spirits from the Steppe, and engendered the Huns, which Pohl compares with the origin of the Sarmatians as presented by Herodotus. The account serves as an explanation for the origins of the Huns.

The account may be based on a historic event when Filimer banished his seeresses as scapegoats for a defeat when their prophesy had proved wrong, They may also have represented the conservative faction and resisted change. This change may have been the rise of the Amal clan and their claims of ancestry from the &quot;anses&quot; (the Aesir clan of gods). As in the case of the early Lombards, this would have taken place after a decisive victory that saved a tribe whose existence had been threatened by enemies. Odin was still a new god, and the Goths worshiped instead the &quot;old&quot; god Gaut who was made the Scandinavian great-grandfather of Amal, the founder of the new ruling clan.

Wagner argues that the demonization of both the women and the Huns shows that the account was written in a Christian context. Morris (1991) comments that it was a precedent for future Christian tradition, where demonic women have intercourse with the Devil or with demons. In the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Leechbook&quot; from the 10th century, there is a prescription for a salve against &quot;women with whom the Devil has sexual intercourse,&quot; and in the 11th century, there appeared the idea that witches and heretics had sexual orgies during their meetings at night.

=== North Germanic corpus ===
Few records of myths among the Germanic peoples survive to modern times. The North Germanic record is an exception, containing the vast majority of material that survives about the mythology of the Germanic peoples. These sources mention numerous seeresses among the North Germanic peoples, including the following:

&quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot; provides a particularly detailed account of the appearance and activities of a seeress. For example, regarding the seeress Þorbjörg Lítilvölva:

A high seat was set for her, complete with a cushion. This was to be stuffed with chicken feathers.

When she arrived one evening, along with the man who had been sent to fetch her, she was wearing a black mantle with a strap, which was adorned with precious stones right down to the hem. About her neck she wore a string of glass beads and on her head a hood of black lambskin lined with white catskin. She bore a staff with a knob at the top, adorned with brass set with stones on top. About her waist she had a linked charm belt with a large purse. In it she kept the charms which she needed for her predictions. She wore calfskin boots lined with fur, with long, sturdy laces and large pewter knobs on the ends. On her hands she wore gloves of catskin, white and lined with fur.

When she entered, everyone was supposed to offer her respectful greetings, and she responded by according to how the person appealed to her. Farmer Thorkel took the wise woman by the hand and led her to the seat which had been prepared for her. He then asked her to survey his flock, servants and buildings. She had little to say about all of it.

That evening tables were set up and food prepared for the seeress. A porridge of kid&#x27;s milk was made for her and as meat she was given the hearts of all the animals available there. She had a spoon of brass and a knife with an ivory shaft, its two halves clasped with bronze bands, and the point of which had broken off.
=== Olga of Kiev ===

There are indications that Olga of Kiev may have served as a Völva, and as a &quot;priestess of Freyja&quot;, before converting to Christianity. In the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, she is described by the noblemen as the &quot;wisest of all women&quot;, where &quot;wise&quot; has several meanings and her reputation as being &quot;wise&quot; goes back to her pre-conversion years. Her wisdom is also reported by &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvassonar&quot;, where she is called &quot;Allogia&quot; and mistaken for Vladimir the Great&#x27;s old mother, although she was his grand-mother. There she is described as &quot;very wise&quot; and her main function at the court was as a prophetess, one whose predictions also came true. When the king of Kievan Rus&#x27; celebrated Yule, he asked her to predict the future and to do so she was carried to him on a chair which recalls the elevated platforms of the seeresses. Although he may not have transmitted a historical event, Oddr Snorrason, who wrote the saga in the 12th c., clearly identified Olga as a völva.

Olga is strongly associated with birds in the sources, which also was true of the goddess Freyja, the goddess of magic (seiðr). The goddess was popular among Scandinavian women in general, and especially among aristocratic women who profited from corollary authority and power. Older scholarship believed that the aristocratic Norse women passively waited at home for their husbands, but the modern view is that they actively took part in warfare from home with seiðr, a magic reflected in the Norse poem &quot;Darraðarljóð&quot;. Consequently, Olga may have been regarded as a high priestess of Freyja, a status which would not only have appealed to her Scandinavian kinsmen but also to her Slavic subjects who would have identified Freyja with the Slavic goddess Mokosh, who was represented as the only goddess among the six raised idols in Kiev.

In 2008, a Scandinavian chamber grave called N°6 was excavated in Pskov, where Olga was born. It was a syncretic grave containing elements from Norse paganism and from Christianity; it has been dated to c. 960. It contained an object called a &quot;jartegn&quot;, a token given to officials by Scandinavian kings and Rus&#x27; rulers, indicating that the buried man had political influence. On the front side it has a bident, which later evolved into a trident and was a symbol of the Rurik dynasty. Above the bident there is a key, and keys were a symbol of the Scandinavian mistress, as Scandinavian women carried the keys of the homestead; Kovalev (2012) argues that the key was also a symbol of Freyja. According to Kovalev, during her regency, before Sviatoslav I came of age, Olga may have chosen to add the key to the seal of the ruler of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the key being a symbol whose significance would have been understood all over northern Europe, not only as the symbol of a woman who has authority, but also as a symbol of guardianship. On the reverse side the &quot;jartegn&quot; has the image of a falcon, a bird not only associated with the Swedish and Rus&#x27; elite of the Viking Age, but also especially associated with the goddesses Freyja and Frigg, who can transform themselves into falcons.). The falcon also appears to wear a cloak of the type worn by Scandinavian women. There is a cross above the falcon; coins bearing the falcon and the cross are dated to Olga&#x27;s time in the 950s and the 960s. Images of women with a bird&#x27;s head have also been found on the Norwegian 9th c. Oseberg tapestry fragments, and the women have been identified as priestesses of Freyja wearing bird masks. Several scholars consider the woman who was buried with the tapestry to have been a völva.

== Archaeological Record ==
The archaeological record for Viking Age society features a variety of graves that are identified as those of North Germanic seeresses. A notable example occurs at Fyrkat, in the northern Jutland region of Denmark. Fyrkat is the site of a former Viking Age ring fortress; the cemetery section of the site contains, among about 30 others, the grave of a woman buried within a horse-drawn carriage and wearing a red and blue dress embroidered with gold thread, all signs of high status. While the grave contains items commonly found in female Viking Age graves such as scissors and spindle whorls, it also contains a variety of other rare and exotic items. For example, the woman wore silver toe rings (otherwise unknown in the Scandinavian record) and her burial contained two bronze bowls originating from Central Asia.

The grave also contained a small purse with seeds from henbane, a poisonous plant, inside it, and a partially disintegrated metal wand, used by seeresses in the Old Norse record. According to the National Museum of Denmark:

:If these seeds are thrown onto a fire, a mildly hallucinogenic smoke is produced. Taken in the right quantities, they can produce hallucinations and euphoric states. Henbane was often used by the witches of later periods. It could be used as a &quot;witch&#x27;s salve&quot; to produce a psychedelic effect, if the magic practitioners rubbed it into their skin. Did the woman from Fyrkat do this? In her belt buckle was white lead, which was sometimes used as an ingredient in skin ointment.

Henbane&#x27;s aphrodisiac properties may have also been relevant to its use by the seeress. At the feet of the corpse was a small box, called a box brooch and originating from the Swedish island of Gotland, which contained owl pellets and bird bones. The grave also contained amulets shaped like a chair, potentially a reflection of the long-standing association of seeresses and chairs (as described in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; from the first century CE, discussed above).

A ship setting grave in Köpingsvik, a location on the Swedish island of Öland, also appears to have contained a seeress. The woman was buried wrapped in bear fur with a variety of notable grave goods: the grave contained a bronze-ornamented staff with a small house atop it, a jug made in Central Asia, and a bronze cauldron smithed in Western Europe. The grave contained animals and humans, perhaps sacrificed.

The Oseberg ship burial also may have contained a seeress. The ship contained the remains of two people, one a woman of elevated status and the other possibly a slave. Along with a variety of other objects, the grave contained a purse containing cannabis seeds and a wooden wand.

Another notable grave containing what has been identified as the remains of a seeress was excavated by archaeologists in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland, Sweden. The grave contained female human remains interred with an iron wand or staff, a carriage, horses, and Arabic bronze jugs. The grave also contained a small silver figurine of a woman with a large necklace, which has been interpreted by archaeologists as representing the goddess Freyja, a deity strongly associated with seiðr, death, and sex.

== Activities ==

In Scandinavian sources, seeresses work as diviners using a practice called seiðr on a ritual platform called &quot;seiðhjallr&quot; (see below), which is associated with shamanism. They also take part in other activities, but they do not appear to perform sacrifices. They are described as ritual specialists travelling from settlement to settlement, sometimes with a group of followers, and late sources tell that they received payment for their services.

=== Chanting ===
In the Roman era, the Germanic word for chanting was similar to the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form *&quot;ʒalđran&quot;, which later evolved into Old Norse &quot;galdr&quot; (&quot;song, charm; witchcraft, sorcery&quot;), OHG (&quot;incantation, charm&quot;) and Old English &quot;ʒealdor&quot; with the same meaning, also rendered as &quot;galdor&quot; (&quot;sound, song, incantation, spell, enchantment&quot;). It is derived from *&quot;ʒalanan&quot;, which became ON &quot;gala&quot; (&quot;to crow, sing&quot;), OHG (&quot;to incantate&quot;) and OE (&quot;to sing&quot;). It is related to the English &quot;nightingale&quot; and &quot;yell&quot;, to Latin &quot;gallus&quot; (&quot;cock&quot;) and it appears in ON &quot;gylfra&quot; (&quot;witch&quot;). The many uses of chanting are revealed in the words that are derived from &quot;galdr&quot;, such as &quot;galdrabók&quot; (&quot;book of magic&quot;), &quot;galdrasmiðja&quot; (&quot;objects used for magic&quot;), &quot;galdravél&quot; (&quot;a magic device&quot;), &quot;galdrahríð&quot; (&quot;magic storm&quot;), &quot;galdrastafir&quot; (&quot;magical characters&quot;) and &quot;valgaldr&quot; (a kind of Odinic necromancy). The modern Swedish word &quot;galen&quot; (&quot;crazy&quot;, literally &quot;having been chanted&quot;) is derived from the word for this practice.

Other names for the songs are &quot;varðlok(k)ur&quot; and &quot;seiðlæti&quot;, where the latter simply means &quot;seiðr songs&quot;. The former term is more complex, and scholars such as Cleasby and Vigfússon, Tolley, Strömbäck and Price have derived it from &quot;vǫrðr&quot; (&quot;guard, protector&quot;). Several scholars have also compared it to the Scotting dialect word &quot;warlock&quot;, and scholars such as Cleasby, Vigfússon and Strömbäck consider it to be the origin of the Scottish word. Katherine Morris translates the word as &quot;warlock-song&quot;.

In &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot;, the songs are said to be sung or spoken by the seeresses&#x27; followers, but at the same time there is only one woman who knows them and sings them. Price argues that since the name appears with two spellings (depending on the manuscript), it is possible to interpret the name in two ways, either by referring to &quot;loka&quot; (&quot;fastening&quot;) or &quot;lokka&quot; (&quot;lure&quot;). He interprets the spelling &quot;varðlokkur&quot; as meaning &quot;to lure the spirits&quot;, and &quot;varðlokur&quot; as meaning &quot;locking the spirits under the seeress&#x27; power&quot;. In this way the term can be simultaneously interpreted as attracting the spirits and locking them under the summoner&#x27;s power, and probably also securing them as protection against hostile entities. In the poem &quot;Grógaldr&quot;, &quot;urðarlokkur&quot;, the norn of fate Urðr&#x27;s &quot;lokkur&quot;, are said to protect a person on all sides, and they are also likely bound to that individual. Tolley points out that the form &quot;urðarlok(k)ur&quot; for these protective spells is probably a reinterperation of an older &quot;vǫrðlokur&quot; (&quot;ward spells&quot;), or more likely another possible form with the same meaning, &quot;varðarlokur&quot; (&quot;spells of warding&quot;).

The chants appear to have been sung with a high pitch, and they are reported to have been pleasing to the ear. In the &quot;Laxdœla saga&quot;, the sweetness of a chant (&quot;seiðlæti&quot;) lures a boy to his death, as intended, and a pleasing sound would also have been understood as attracting spirits to the summoner. Price suggests that the nearest equivalent to these high pitched and pleasing chants are the traditional Swedish herding calls (&quot;lockrop&quot; in modern Swedish, which still contains the linguistic element &quot;lokk&quot;-).

=== Projection ===

While the &quot;varðlok(k)ur&quot; (mentioned above) attracted protective spirits that provided information to the enchantress, there were animal spirits that were sent out to collect information for her, and to perform other tasks. Consequently, the task of the sorceress was to control spirits, and the name that appears to have been used for these spirits and for several other aspects in sorcery is &quot;gandr&quot; (pl. &quot;gandir&quot;); the relationship between the extended meanings of &quot;gandr&quot; is complex and a matter of discussion among scholars. The original meaning appears to be &quot;something which is connected with the soul of the magician and can be sent out from him or her in sleep or ecstasy&quot;.

According to de Vries, the origin of &quot;gandr&quot; is a word &quot;gan&quot;- meaning &quot;magic&quot;, of which there was an ablaut grade &quot;gin&quot;- (in English there is still a semantic relationship between the ablaut grades &quot;swam&quot; and &quot;swim&quot;, and &quot;sat&quot; and &quot;sit&quot;) that may be found in the name of the primordial chasm &quot;Ginnungagap&quot; (&quot;space filled with magic powers&quot;), and on the migration age Björketorp and Stentoften runestones, it appears in the sense &quot;magically powerful&quot; in Proto-Norse &quot;ginnarunaʀ&quot; (&quot;powerful runes&quot;). It was also used as an intensifier in the compounds &quot;ginnregin&quot; (&quot;great powers&quot;, i.e. the gods) and &quot;ginnheilagr&quot; (&quot;extremely holy&quot;). As a noun it meant &quot;falsehood&quot; and &quot;deception&quot;, while the verb &quot;ginna&quot; meant &quot;to dupe or to fool someone&quot;.

The &quot;gan&quot;- ablaut grade was combined with the suffix -&quot;đra&quot;-, the same as in &quot;galdr&quot;, from &quot;gala&quot;, &quot;chant&quot; (see section on &quot;Chanting&quot;, above). Tolley argues that the original meaning cannot have included &quot;staff&quot;, but rather that it would have meant &quot;sorcerer spirit&quot; from which would have been derived the additional meanings &quot;wand&quot;, &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;serpent&quot; (Jörmungandr). The &quot;sorcerer&#x27;s spirit&quot; (&quot;gandr&quot;) could be summoned or sent out to gather information; this spirit is in animal form, but possibly not always. The extension to the meanings &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;serpent&quot; is due to the fact that spirits had animal form, and the term &quot;gandreið&quot; originally meant the ride of a sorcerer on a spirit in animal form such as that of a wolf. Supernatural creatures could also use wolves as steeds; later the term came to refer to the sorcerer riding on a staff.

In Old Norse sources, the noun &quot;gandreið&quot; and the verb &quot;renna gand&quot; (or &quot;renna gǫndum&quot;) can refer to going out to gather information in a non-corporeal sense, but it can also refer to magically flying on a staff in a physical sense. Price disagrees with Tolley&#x27;s argument that &quot;staff&quot; was not part of the original meaning of &quot;gandr&quot; and suggests that the staff/wand (&quot;gandr&quot; or &quot;gǫndull&quot;) was part of the ritual of summoning and releasing the &quot;gandir&quot; (&quot;spirits&quot;) for the purpose of clairvoyance or prophesy, and sometimes in order to harm people. The use of the staff may have implied sexual magic and sexual acts while it was used, and the staff was possibly also ridden in order to hurt enemies.

Some examples of aggressive projection are also preserved in Old English poems, such as the &quot;Nine Herbs Charm&quot;, &quot;Against a Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Wið færstice&quot;. Especially the last poem contains many Germanic pagan elements that are also found in Old Norse sources, such as sorceresses (&quot;hægtessan&quot;), elves (&quot;ylfa&quot;), Æsir gods (&quot;esa&quot;), the magic of smiths, and the presence of women that are like Valkyries.

During the eighth decade of the first century, the Semnonian seeress Ganna succeeded the Bructerian seeress Veleda as the leader of an alliance of Germanic tribes when the latter had been captured and deported by the Romans. Her name &quot;Ganna&quot; is usually linked to the ON word &quot;gandr&quot; – Simek comments that instead of being a reference to a wand as her tool or insignia, her name may be a reference to her function among the Germanic tribes (like Veleda&#x27;s name). Sundqvist also comments that the name may have referred instead to her abilities, like de Vries who connects her name directly to the grade &quot;gin(n)&quot;- (see above).

=== Prophesying ===
There are two ways in which the seeress conveys the acquired information to the audience. One of them is by having a seizure during the trance and gasping for air with a wide open mouth (&quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot; and &quot;Hauks þáttr hábrókar&quot;). She delivers her prophesy during the trance, and it may be said that a song appears from elsewhere in her mouth (&quot;Ǫrvar-Odds saga&quot; and &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;). In &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot;, it is in the beginning of the trance that she breathes in, and Tolley considers that this may represent a breathing in of spirits rather than her letting out her soul. Price comments that as far as textual criticism is concerned, this detail can not have been borrowed from those of the neighbouring Fenno-Ugric peoples, because the closest practitioners are the Yukaghir people on the other side of Eurasia, whose practices were inaccessible for the saga writers.

The other situation occurs when the seeress has returned from her trance and tells about it while awake (&quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot; and &quot;Vatnsdœla saga&quot;).

== Attributes ==
=== Wands ===

=== Staffs ===
Given that seeresses are often referred to as &quot;staff bearers&quot; the use of staffs was also a prominent tool for völva as well as other magic users. These staffs were often made from metal alloys and were used in funeral rituals and other religious rites. 

=== Platforms ===
There appears to be a continuity between elements such as the first century Bructerian seeress Veleda&#x27;s tower and the &quot;seiðhjallr&quot; that played an important role in Scandinavian sources. The word &quot;seiðhjallr&quot; means &quot;incantation scaffold&quot;, for performing magic.

=== Hallucinogens ===

The notion of ecstatic experience induced or complemented by the use of intoxicants in the context of Nordic pagan religion is not new, and there have been several attempts to reconstruct such practices. Little evidence to confirm the Viking Age ingestion of hallucinogens such as psilocybin mushrooms or other entheogens has been found, with the exception of two archaeological finds:

Several hundred seeds of henbane were found in grave 4 at Fyrkat. Their presence in the grave is likely significant, and the herb&#x27;s deliriant properties suggest aspects of the rituals that might have been performed with it. There are many medieval accounts describing henbane&#x27;s use as an ingredient in witches&#x27; ointments, used when a sorceress wished to change physical form. Henbane contains the psychoactive drug scopolamine, and when consumed as a tea, or when its juice is made into a topical salve and rubbed into the skin, especially around the armpits and chest, hallucinations can be experienced. A strong sensation of flight is often felt, which remains vivid for several hours. &quot;Bilsenkraut&quot;, the German name of henbane, is derived from the Indo-European &quot;bhelena&quot;; according to some sources, it originally meant &quot;plant of madness&quot;. The proto-Germanic &quot;bil&quot; seems to have meant &quot;vision, hallucination&quot; or &quot;magical power.&quot;

Four seeds of the mind-altering plant cannabis sativa were found in the Oseberg ship burial, among the piles of pillows thrown into the prow of the ship when the grave was robbed. A single seed of cannabis was also found embedded in a clump of decayed leather, bound by a thin woollen cord, apparently the remains of a small leather pouch with a draw-string; it is possible that all the seeds were originally contained in this bag. The pouch was too small to hold enough seeds for planting, suggesting that they might have had symbolic significance, and could have been connected with the higher status woman&#x27;s religious functions.

=== Cats ===

All over the world cats are often linked to magical practices, and the goddess Freyja, who was the first divinity reported to have practiced magic, was associated with cats. Cats and catskins appear to have been important symbols for the seeresses. In &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot;, the account of Þorbjörg lítilvölva tells that her ritual dress had a black lambskin hood that was lined with white catskin and on her hands she wore catskin gloves. Ellis Davidson argues that the catskin represents the seeresses&#x27; helping animal spirits (see the section on magical &quot;projection&quot;, above), and Price connects these cat spirits with the cats that pull Freyja&#x27;s wagon.

The most opulent female grave from the Viking Age is the extremely rich Oseberg ship burial from the first half of the 9th c. that contained two women. Although previously considered to be the grave of a queen, several scholars, such as Stine Ingstad, Neil Price and Leszek Gardeła note that the finds indicate that it was instead the grave of a seeress. In addition to a staff and cannabis it contained a chest with catskins, and a wagon that had one end decorated with nine cats (a significant number), animals sacred to Freyja , which suggests that it was a reference to the goddess whose wagon is pulled by cats, according to &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. About 50 graves from Medelpad, the Mälaren Valley and Gotland, most of which are identified as the graves of wealthy women, contain lynx skins; it has been argued that these powerful women had a special connection with the goddess Freyja.

== Christianity ==

The seeresses rarely appear in the earliest Scandinavian written sources, such as runestones and skaldic poetry, and they do not appear in place names which suggests a marginal position in society; older research has cast them in a negative light. However, evidence points to the place name of &quot;Lytir&quot; possibly being the name of a male prophesier. Simek comments that all our sources on Germanic seeresses have passed through the filter of Roman and Christian interpretations. The Romans interpreted them as similar to their augurs, while the Christian writers considered them to be &quot;more or less witches&quot;. In sources from the Christian era, their rituals are described as suspicious and sometimes evil. This attitude can even be seen in some Eddic lays, and in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson writes that their practice was so evil that &quot;manly men considered it too shameful to practise it, and so it was taught to priestesses&quot;. It is possible that the Christian scribes wanted to minimize and deprecate them and their rites and turn them into an oddity. Price comments that the associations with Freyja and the Vanir gods lingered for a long time in Christian medieval Scandinavia, but the Viking Age views were replaced by negative views influenced by Christian attitudes towards female sexuality as something dangerous that had to be contained. This was related to the same fears that later led to witchcraft hysteria, manifested as what Ellis Davidson referred to as &quot;the sinister light which played round [Freyja&#x27;s] cult for the story-tellers of a Christian age&quot;.

Evidence from Icelandic law shows that the accusation of witchcraft was to be considered libel and slander if proven wrong, dmonstrating societal disdain for witchcraft during the time. However, these laws are not clear on the practicing of witchcraft and much of this view could have been skewed after the introduction of Christianity.

Modern archaeological finds, however, do not confirm that the North Germanic seeresses had a marginal position at the bottom of society as depicted by older scholarship and Christian sources, but instead they suggest the contrary. The seeresses have been cast in a new light by a recent detailed analysis of &quot;Landnámabók&quot;, the &quot;Íslendingasögur&quot; and the &quot;Íslendingaþættir&quot;, which point out that the practitioners of magic were respected and well integrated in society. They were often connected to the highest echelons of society, they were free and they owned land. In a Norwegian setting they usually belong to Norwegian families, and in Iceland they do not live in caves or on islands, but in settlements with other people. Nor are they described as perverted or as sexual deviants. Moreover, archaeological studies from Norway and Sweden, such as that of the Oseberg burial, show that they belonged to the highest elite and were part of aristocratic society.

=== Late Middle Ages ===

The seeress tradition did not disappear, at least not during the Middle Ages. Mitchell writes in his book &quot;Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages&quot; (2011) that not even the most triumphalist Christian, nor even the most sceptic scholar, can deny the continued survival of the practices of these women. However, it is also clear that during centuries of transmission, their practices changed through external influences, and evolved. Attitudes also changed and sorcery was increasingly considered to be witchcraft during the Middle Ages, and by the 15th century society appears no longer to have distinguished between sorcesses and healers such as midwives and wise women. The witch was inherently evil, she could fly to the sabbath and have intercourse with the devil, and she ate infants.

=== Witch-hunts ===
The &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; extended the concept of &quot;witch&quot; to more women, and concepts that used to be separate – folklore and witchcraft - merged with the concept of heresy. Morris argues that without this book there would probably never have been witch-hunts, and that the printing press helped spread the notion of diabolical witchcraft from the ecclesiastical elite to a larger part of the population. This was also the time of the revival of &quot;high magic&quot; during the renaissance, but the Church did not separate the two and persecuted both the &quot;low magic&quot; and &quot;high magic&quot; as heresy. About eighty per cent of those accused of witchcraft were women, and the accusations included Devil worship, having sex with the Devil, sex both oral and anal, incest and cannibalism of infants. Morris comments that the accusations reveal more about the inquisitors than about the women who were accused. The accusations were characterized by ecclesiastical attitudes towards female sexuality, and it is notable that the practices they were accused of were preventive to procreation. Morris argues that the evolution from Germanic pagan seeresses to witches during the witch-hunts is a case study in how attitudes towards magic were affected by the change of religion.

== Modern influence ==
The concept of the Germanic seeress has had influence in a variety of areas of popular culture. For example, in 1965, the Icelandic scholar Sigurður Nordal coined the Icelandic language term for computer—&quot;&quot;— by blending the words &quot;tala&quot; (number) and &quot;völva&quot;.

The seeress Veleda has inspired a number of artworks, including German writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Welleda und Ganna&quot;, an 1844 marble statue by French sculptor Hippolyte Maindron, an illustration, &quot;Veleda, die Prophetin der Brukterer&quot;, by K. Sigrist, and Polish-American composer Eduard Sobolewski&#x27;s 1836 opera &quot;Velleda&quot;.

Practitioners of Germanic Heathenry, the modern revival of Germanic paganism, seek to revive the concept of the Germanic seeress. Sects of American Heathenism have arisen recently, drawing upon the teachings of Germanic seeresses and applying these more masculine notions to traditional American home life.

The asteroid 131 Vala is named for the ancient Norse &quot;vǫlva&quot;.

A version of a rare male seer can be seen depicted by Willem Dafoe in the film The Northman.

In the 2024 video game Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II, the protagonist Senua, who suffers from psychosis, is called a seiðkona by Fargrímr upon arrival in his camp due to her visions and ability to hear voices such as those of the Hiddenfolk.

<doc id="476384" wikidata="Q2334343" url="?curid=476384" title="1948 KLM Constellation air disaster">
<text>A KLM Lockheed L-049 Constellation airliner (named &quot;Nijmegen&quot; and registered PH-TEN) crashed into high ground near Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Scotland, on 20 October 1948; all 40 aboard died. A subsequent inquiry found that the accident was likely caused by the crew&#x27;s reliance on a combination of erroneous charts and incomplete weather forecasts, causing the crew to become distracted and disoriented in the inclement conditions.

==The flight==

===Events prior to approach===
The aircraft was piloted by Koene Dirk Parmentier, one of the winners of the MacRobertson Air Race, widely regarded as one of the great flyers of the era, and KLM&#x27;s chief pilot. The co-pilot on the flight was Kevin Joseph O&#x27;Brien.

&quot;Nijmegen&quot; was scheduled to fly from its home base at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam at 8:00 p.m. CET to New York via Prestwick, with Shannon Airport in Ireland as the alternative stopover point in case of bad weather at Prestwick. The aircraft carried sufficient fuel to divert to Shannon and then back to Schiphol, if necessary. The plane&#x27;s departure was delayed as additional cargo was loaded for transport to Iceland, which would be an additional stop en route from Prestwick to New York.

The plane eventually left Schiphol at 9:11 p.m., crossed the English coast at Flamborough Head, eventually heading NW at 2320, when it turned almost due South approximately 15 miles ESE of Kilmarnock. The aircraft eventually started its run in towards runway 32 (Prestwick&#x27;s longest runway and, at the time, its only runway that offered a ground-controlled approach, at 2325 at 1500&#x27;.
The weather forecast Parmentier had been given by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute at Schiphol had told him that there was some slight cloud at Prestwick, but that it would likely dissipate by the time the &quot;Nijmegen&quot; arrived. This report was incorrect; the weather at Prestwick was steadily deteriorating, with the weather at the alternative destination of Shannon even worse.

Parmentier believed that there was a strong crosswind, blowing at right-angles to the main runway (Runway 32) at Prestwick of about 20 knots, which might prevent a landing on it. Prestwick had a second, alternative, runway (Runway 26) which was heading into the wind but had no radar-approach system. However, KLM pilot guidelines, drafted by Parmentier himself, forbade a landing at Prestwick in low cloud on the alternative runway.

By the time of approach, Prestwick was under drizzle and a cloud-base that was almost solid at , forecast to continue from about 11:00 p.m. onwards, around the time the &quot;Nijmegen&quot; was approaching the airfield. As the flight had taken off late, they had not picked up the radio message broadcast by Prestwick airfield informing them of this. Parmentier was thus unaware of the deterioration in the weather: were he aware of it he would have been able to divert to Shannon. The routine weather reports broadcast from Prestwick had given a cloud cover of . No new forecasts, which would have told Parmentier of the expected decreased ceiling were broadcast. Nor did he know that already that evening two airliners from SAS had turned back rather than attempt a landing at Prestwick.

Inland of the runway was high ground of over , but the KLM-issued charts which the crew were using did not mark any land higher than . Three miles (5 km) to the north-east of the runway, rising to over , were a set of wireless masts. inland ran a series of electricity pylons and high-tension cables, the main national grid line for South Scotland, carrying 132,000 volts. However, the error-riddled charts issued by KLM did not have these marked and gave a spot height close by of 45&#x27;.

===Approach and crash===
The plane made radio contact with approach control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00 p.m. At this point the cross-wind over the main runway had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14 knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the main runway. Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the main runway guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternative runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier expected to be in visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.

At 11:16 p.m. Prestwick broadcast a morse message warning of the deteriorating weather, however as the &quot;Nijmegen&quot; had now switched over to voice contact the message would not have been received. On the approach they were told of the decreased cross-wind and decided to attempt a landing on the main runway after all. However, three miles out Parmentier decided that the wind was probably too strong for landing on the main runway and decided to overshoot and land on the alternate. He overflew Runway 26, the lights of which he could now see, climbed to a height of and extended the landing gear ready for landing. At this point they ran into what Parmentier believed was an isolated patch of cloud. However, this was the actual cloud-base, which was now as low as in some areas. At this point the &quot;Nijmegen&quot; was headed directly for the power cables at , which the crew believed to be substantially lower.

Parmentier realised the &#x27;isolated fog&#x27; he had run into was getting denser, but due to his belief that they would have visual contact with the ground the crew had not attempted to time their flight downwind of the runway. Before he could abort the attempt, the plane crashed into the electricity cables, hitting the main phase conductor line. The crew attempted to turn the now burning aircraft towards the runway with the intent of an emergency landing. However, the faulty charts led them to crash into high ground five miles east-north-east of the airfield at about 23:32 UTC.

All 30 passengers (22 Dutch, 6 German, 1 British and 1 Irish) and the 10 crew died. Rescue services did not reach the crash-site for over one and a half hours due to confusion over which service was responsible for responding to the crash. By the time they arrived only six people were still alive, and all died within 24 hours.

==Court of enquiry==
The subsequent court of enquiry blamed several factors for the crash:
*The failure of the ground authorities to inform the &quot;Nijmegen&quot; of the deterioration in the weather.
*The failure of the crew to time their flight downwind of the runway.
*The errors in the official KLM approach chart the crew had relied on. It emerged during the enquiry that these charts had been copied from war-era United States Air Force charts, which upon subsequent examination were also found to be faulty. The court of enquiry was astonished to find that KLM had relied on maps from a foreign authority when detailed and correct maps were available from the Ordnance Survey, the United Kingdom&#x27;s national mapping authority.

The enquiry determined the probable cause for the accident was:

<doc id="476390" wikidata="Q5644004" url="?curid=476390" title="Hamakor">
<text>Hamakor (), officially known as Hamakor – Israeli Society for Free and Open Source Software (), is an Israeli non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of free and open source software in Israel.

Hamakor was founded in January 2003 in order to promote free software and open source in Israel.

== Background and formation ==
Several members of Israel&#x27;s open-source community, most notably Gilad Ben-Yossef and Doron Ofek, pioneered the idea of forming an official, legally recognized organization. They wanted to counter difficulties with the non-open-source-related bodies and to address the inherently decentralized way open source is developed and advocated. Two main bodies expected to deal with organizations in that respect: the media, which is accustomed to having someone to call to get a comment, and the Knesset, where standing up in front of legislators requires answering the implicit question &quot;who am I and why should you listen to me?&quot;. It was felt that, as individuals, the community&#x27;s ability to make a difference suffered in comparison with an organized body.

The idea matured for some time. The final push to form the actual organization came from a desire by Gilad Ben-Yossef, circa July 2002, to see &quot;Revolution OS&quot; in Israel. It turned out that the only way to see the movie was to rent a cinema hall and to pay the distributor. Gilad decided to open the event to the public and to charge a small fee for entrance to cover costs. The event, labeled &quot;August Penguin&quot;, took place on the first Friday of August, 2002. The event proved a financial success, in that an extra 2000 NIS were recorded after expenses. Gilad pledged to use that money to start the official organization. This also affected Hamakor&#x27;s charter, adding to it the capacity to act as a recognized money-handler on behalf of the community for organizing events or any other monetary activity.

== Meaning of the name ==
The name for Hamakor was offered by Ira Abramov. It was offered after a series of Linux related names was offered, as a name that is not specifically related to Linux (as opposed to free software at large) on one hand, and yet does have a Linux specific reference hidden in it. The word &quot;Makor&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;source&quot; (as in open source), but also &quot;beak&quot;, being a hidden reference to Tux being a bird.

The original name as submitted to the registrar of non-profits was &quot;Hamakor – The Israeli Society for Free and Open Source Software&quot;. The registrar struck down &quot;the&quot;, claiming Hamakor has no right to claim exclusivity.

== Two levels of membership ==
Most of the points in Hamakor&#x27;s charter were either fairly straightforward, based on the reasons for forming it, or a result of legal requirements. One point that was largely debated, however, was whether anyone could become a full voting member. Hamakor aimed to represent the community. The concern raised was that the commercial companies would try to take control over the organization. As a result, two restrictions were imposed. The first was that membership was limited to individuals only. The second was the creation of a two-level membership structure. Hamakor has members, who have full voting rights, and friends. A friend is an individual who enjoys all the benefits (such as they are) of a member, except for one—friends cannot vote on charter changes or when electing the board.

To move from friend status to full member status, one has to demonstrate some activity promoting free/open source software. The definition of &quot;some&quot; has changed over time. During some periods, the board required writing non-trivial amounts of code, while at other times, the board deemed helping a friend install Linux on their computer sufficient.

In most cases, almost anyone who wished to become a full member could do so.

==August Penguin==
Having a gathering on the first Friday of August has become a tradition, and August Penguin has turned into the yearly conference for Hamakor. Of course, due to the way the organization was formed, there is one more August Penguin conference than years Hamakor exists, having the unique situation where an organization&#x27;s yearly conference actually pre-dates the organization&#x27;s forming.

In 2005, the conference made an attempt to make the conference more aimed at the professional audience. As part of it, it was moved to Thursday (Friday is part of the weekend in Israel). In 2006, the conference was moved back to Friday, but due to scheduling problems happened on the second Friday of August. The conference is no longer about watching a movie, and has lectures from various sources. The conference also accepts sponsors, with the Israeli Internet Association being the most consistent one over the years.

==Meeting the objectives==
It can be claimed the Hamakor managed to meet the original objectives behind its forming. Journalists do contact, either Hamakor directly or known people within the open source community for comments about events. Hamakor was active in blocking several DMCA like law proposals in Israel, and even managed to affect (alongside the Israeli chapter of the Internet Society) the renewed Copyright law in Israel, both in blocking anti-circumvention text from entering it and in keeping pro-customer text in it, and even managed to enhance the explicit reverse engineering allowance in the law to cover security audits as a legitimate reason to reverse engineer. Alongside August Penguin, it can be claimed that all of the original goals set for the society were met.

Since Hamakor operates with a balanced budget, and since the above activity is reactive in nature, some feel that Hamakor should take it on itself to do more. To date, Hamakor has not managed to overcome the gap between the centralized way a legal entity must act and the decentralized way a community acts. Hamakor&#x27;s action are based solely on volunteers, and as such, is time constrained. Hamakor was involved in several initiatives that were attempted, but either never managed to make a real difference, or otherwise are taking years to show actual results. One such initiative was forming Linux based classrooms in schools – several schools came along, Hamakor managed to get equipment donated (or, in some cases, bought it), but lack of local volunteers made the project grind to halt almost completely.

Another aspect of this contradiction is the fact that while a lot of free software activity takes place in Israel, it is not directly Hamakor&#x27;s doing. This is not a problem if Hamakor is limited to its original objectives, but when these objectives are expanded, resource limitation becomes a visible problem.

==Activities==
Hamakor&#x27;s primary activities include organization of the yearly August Penguin convention and support for the Israeli &quot;Welcome to Linux&quot; tradition of a yearly series of presentations and Linux Installfests that introduce Linux to beginners. The latter was started by the Haifa Linux Club but is now also conducted by the Tel Aviv Linux Club and the Jerusalem Linux Club.

==Hamakor prize==

Hamakor awards a prize annually, recognizing an Israeli who has made a significant and important contribution to Free Software. The awardee is determined in an Academy Award-like process, with all Hamakor members and friends being eligible to vote for the most deserving person, who is typically announced at the annual August Penguin event. In 2010, the prize was given in several categories: personal contribution, team/group or institute contribution and contribution for the Education system.

<text>Inulins are a group of naturally occurring polysaccharides produced by many types of plants, industrially most often extracted from chicory. The inulins belong to a class of dietary fibers known as fructans. Inulin is used by some plants as a means of storing energy and is typically found in roots or rhizomes. Most plants that synthesize and store inulin do not store other forms of carbohydrate such as starch. In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved inulin as a dietary fiber ingredient used to improve the nutritional value of manufactured food products. Using inulin to measure kidney function is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for comparison with other means of estimating glomerular filtration rate.

== Origin and history ==
Inulin is a natural storage carbohydrate present in more than 36,000 species of plants, including agave, wheat, onion, bananas, garlic, asparagus, Jerusalem artichoke, and chicory. For these plants, inulin is used as an energy reserve and for regulating cold resistance. Because it is soluble in water, it is osmotically active. Certain plants can change the osmotic potential of their cells by changing the degree of polymerization of inulin molecules by hydrolysis. By changing osmotic potential without changing the total amount of carbohydrate, plants can withstand cold and drought during winter periods.

Inulin was discovered in 1804 by German scientist Valentin Rose. He found &quot;a peculiar substance&quot; from &quot;Inula helenium&quot; roots by boiling-water extraction. In the 1920s, J. Irvine used chemical methods such as methylation to study the molecular structure of inulin, and he designed the isolation method for this new anhydrofructose. During studies of renal tubules in the 1930s, researchers searched for a substance that could serve as a biomarker that is not reabsorbed or secreted after introduction into tubules. A. N. Richards introduced inulin because of its high molecular weight and its resistance to enzymes. Inulin is used to determine glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.

== Chemical structure and properties ==
Inulin is a heterogeneous collection of fructose polymers. It consists of chain-terminating glucosyl moieties and a repetitive fructosyl moiety, which are linked by β(2,1) bonds. The degree of polymerization (DP) of standard inulin ranges from 2 to 60. After removing the fractions with DP lower than 10 during manufacturing process, the remaining product is high-performance inulin. Some articles considered the fractions with DP lower than 10 as short-chained fructo-oligosaccharides, and only called the longer-chained molecules inulin.

Because of the β(2,1) linkages, inulin is not digested by enzymes in the human alimentary system, contributing to its functional properties: reduced calorie value, dietary fiber, and prebiotic effects. Without color and odor, it has little impact on sensory characteristics of food products. Oligofructose has 35% of the sweetness of sucrose, and its sweetening profile is similar to sugar. Standard inulin is slightly sweet, while high-performance inulin is not. Its solubility is higher than the classical fibers. When thoroughly mixed with liquid, inulin forms a gel and a white creamy structure, which is similar to fat. Its three-dimensional gel network, consisting of insoluble submicron crystalline inulin particles, immobilizes a large amount of water, assuring its physical stability. It can also improve the stability of foams and emulsions.

==Uses==

=== Harvesting and extraction ===
Chicory root is the main source of extraction for commercial production of inulin. The extraction process for inulin is similar to obtaining sugar from sugar beets. After harvest, the chicory roots are sliced and washed, then soaked in a solvent (hot water or ethanol); the inulin is then isolated, purified, and spray dried. Inulin may also be synthesized from sucrose.

===Processed foods===
Inulin received no-objection status as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including long-chain inulin as GRAS. In the early 21st century, the use of inulin in processed foods was due in part to its adaptable characteristics for manufacturing. It is approved by the FDA as an ingredient to enhance the dietary fiber value of manufactured foods. Its flavor ranges from bland to subtly sweet (about 10% of the sweetness of sugar/sucrose). It can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour. This is advantageous because inulin contains 25–35% of the food energy of carbohydrates (starch, sugar). In addition to being a versatile ingredient, inulin provides nutritional advantages by increasing calcium absorption and possibly magnesium absorption, while promoting the growth of intestinal bacteria. Chicory inulin is reported to increase absorption of calcium in young women with lower calcium absorption and in young men. In terms of nutrition, it is considered a form of soluble fiber and is sometimes categorized as a prebiotic. It is also considered a FODMAP, a class of carbohydrates which are rapidly fermented in the colon producing gas. Although FODMAPs may cause certain digestive discomfort in some people, they produce potentially favorable alterations in the intestinal flora that contribute to maintaining health of the colon.

Due to the body&#x27;s limited ability to process fructans, inulin has minimal increasing impact on blood sugar, and may potentially have use in managing blood sugar-related illnesses, such as metabolic syndrome.

===Medical===
Inulin and its analog sinistrin are used to help measure kidney function by determining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman&#x27;s capsule per unit time.

While inulin is the gold standard for measuring the GFR, it is rarely used in practice due to the expense and difficulty in conducting the test; it requires intravenous (IV) access for the infusion of inulin as well as up to twelve blood samples taken from the patient over the course of four hours. To determine the glomerular filtration rate in humans, a large initial dose of inulin is injected, which is followed by a constant infusion of inulin at a rate which compensates for its loss in the urine, thus maintaining a reasonably constant level in the plasma. In the United States, creatinine clearance is more widely used to estimate GFR.

A 2017 systematic review of low-to-moderate quality clinical trial research showed that dietary supplementation with inulin-type fructans reduced blood levels of low-density cholesterol, a biomarker of cardiovascular disease.

===Possible side effects===
In doses of 15–50 grams per day, dietary inulin increases the frequency of defecation. Possible side effects of regularly using inulin in the diet include gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and stomach inflammation in people with allergies to inulin.

===Industrial use===
Nonhydrolyzed inulin can also be directly converted to ethanol in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process, which may have potential for converting crops high in inulin into ethanol for fuel.

==Biochemistry==

Inulins are polymers composed mainly of fructose units (fructans), and typically have a terminal glucose. The fructose units in inulins are joined by a β(2→1) glycosidic bond. The molecule is almost exclusively linear, with only a few percent branching. In general, plant inulins contain between 2 and 70 fructose units or sometimes as high as 200, but molecules with less than 10 units are called fructo-oligosaccharides, the simplest being 1-kestose, which has two fructose units and one glucose unit. Bacterial inulin is more highly branched (more than 15% branching) and contains on the order of tens or hundreds of subunits.

Inulins are named in the following manner, where n is the number of fructose residues and py is the abbreviation for pyranosyl:
* Inulins &quot;with&quot; a terminal glucose are known as &quot;alpha&quot;-D-glucopyranosyl-[beta-D-fructofuranosyl](n-1)-D-fructofuranosides, abbreviated as GpyFn.
* Inulins &quot;without&quot; glucose are &quot;beta&quot;-D-fructopyranosyl-[D-fructofuranosyl](n-1)-D-fructofuranosides, abbreviated as FpyFn.

Hydrolysis of inulins may yield fructo-oligosaccharides, which are oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 10 or less.

==Calculation of glomerular filtration rate==
Inulin is uniquely treated by nephrons in that it is completely filtered at the glomerulus but neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the tubules. This property of inulin allows the clearance of inulin to be used clinically as a highly accurate measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) — the rate of plasma from the afferent arteriole that is filtered into Bowman&#x27;s capsule measured in ml/min.

It is informative to contrast the properties of inulin with those of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is partially filtered from plasma at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed by the tubules, in a manner identical to inulin. PAH is different from inulin in that the fraction of PAH that bypasses the glomerulus and enters the nephron&#x27;s tubular cells (via the peritubular capillaries) is completely secreted. Renal clearance of PAH is thus useful in calculation of renal plasma flow (RPF), which empirically is (1-hematocrit) times renal blood flow. Of note, the clearance of PAH is reflective only of RPF to portions of the kidney that deal with urine formation, and, thus, underestimates the actual RPF by about 10%.

The measurement of GFR by inulin or sinistrin is still considered the gold standard. However, it has now been largely replaced by other, simpler measures that are approximations of GFR. These measures, which involve clearance of such substrates as EDTA, iohexol, cystatin C, 125I-iothalamate (sodium radioiothalamate), the chromium radioisotope 51Cr (chelated with EDTA), and creatinine, have had their utility confirmed in large cohorts of patients with chronic kidney disease.

For both inulin and creatinine, the calculations involve concentrations in the urine and in the serum. However, unlike creatinine, inulin is not naturally present in the body. This is an advantage of inulin (because the amount infused will be known) and a disadvantage (because an infusion is necessary).

==Metabolism &quot;in vivo&quot;==
Inulin is indigestible by the human enzymes ptyalin and amylase which are adapted to digest starch and as a result, it passes through much of the digestive system intact. Only in the colon do bacteria metabolise inulin with the release of significant quantities of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and/or methane. Inulin-containing foods can be rather gassy, especially for those unaccustomed to inulin and these foods should be consumed in moderation at first.

Inulin is a soluble fiber, one of three types of dietary fiber including soluble, insoluble and resistant starch. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gelatinous material. Some soluble fibers may help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels.

Because normal digestion does not break inulin down into monosaccharides, it does not elevate blood sugar levels and may therefore be helpful in the management of diabetes. Inulin also stimulates the growth of bacteria in the gut.
Inulin passes through the stomach and duodenum undigested and is highly available to the gut bacterial flora. This makes it similar to resistant starches and other fermentable carbohydrates.

Some traditional diets contain over 20g per day of inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides. The diet of the prehistoric hunter-forager in the Chihuahuan Desert has been estimated to include 135 g per day of inulin-type fructans. Many foods naturally high in inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides such as chicory, garlic, and leek have been seen as &quot;stimulants of good health&quot; for centuries.

As of 2013, no regulatory authority had permitted health claims in the marketing of prebiotics as a class. Inulin&#x27;s health effects had been studied in small clinical trials which showed that it causes gastrointestinal adverse effects such as bloating and flatulence and it does not affect triglyceride levels or development of fatty liver. It may also help to prevent travelers&#x27; diarrhea and may help increase calcium absorption in adolescents.

<text>Vagn Walfrid Ekman (3 May 1874 – 9 March 1954) was a Swedish oceanographer.

Born in Stockholm to Fredrik Laurentz Ekman, himself an oceanographer, he became committed to oceanography while studying physics at the University of Uppsala and, in particular, on hearing Vilhelm Bjerknes lecture on fluid dynamics.

During the expedition of the &quot;Fram&quot;, Fridtjof Nansen had observed that icebergs tend to drift not in the direction of the prevailing wind but at an angle of 20° to 40° to the right. Bjerknes invited Ekman, still a student, to investigate the problem. Later, in 1905, Ekman published his theory of the Ekman spiral which explains the phenomenon in terms of the balance between frictional effects in the ocean and the Coriolis force, which arises from moving objects in a rotating environment, like planetary rotation.

On completing his doctorate in Uppsala in 1902, Ekman joined the International Laboratory for Oceanographic Research, Oslo where he worked for seven years, not only extending his theoretical work but also developing experimental techniques and instruments such as the Ekman current meter and Ekman water bottle.

From 1910 to 1939 he continued his theoretical and experimental work at the University of Lund, where he was professor of mechanics and mathematical physics. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1935.

A gifted amateur bass singer, pianist, and composer, he continued working right up to his death in Gostad, near Stockaryd, Sweden.

<text>John Galbraith Graham MBE (16 February 1921 – 26 November 2013) was a British crossword compiler, best known as Araucaria of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He was also, like his father Eric Graham, a Church of England priest.

==Career==

Graham was born in Oxford, where his father, Eric Graham, held the post of dean of Oriel College. The family moved to a country rectory in Wiltshire.
After attending St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford, he obtained a place to read classics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, leaving to join the RAF when the Second World War began. After the war he returned to King&#x27;s to read theology. In 1949 he joined the staff of St Chad&#x27;s College, Durham as Chaplain and Tutor where he worked until 1952. On Graham&#x27;s departure the Principal, Theo Wetherall, paying tribute to his good nature, wrote that &quot;he squandered his sensitive taste and knowledge of Classics on 1B Greek with unfailing patience enlivened by rare expressions of nausea&quot;. He later became a vicar in Huntingdonshire.

Writing his first puzzle for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 1958, he eventually took to compiling crosswords full-time when his divorce in the late 1970s lost him his living as a clergyman (he was reinstated after the death of his first wife). In December 1970, &quot;The Guardian&quot; began publishing its crosswords under the pseudonyms of their compilers, at which point Graham selected the name &quot;Araucaria&quot;.

Besides Araucaria&#x27;s cryptic crosswords in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, of which he produced around six per month, he also set around a third of the quick crosswords for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, cryptic crosswords as Cinephile in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and puzzles for other publications. In 1984, he founded 1 Across magazine as a way of providing more of his puzzles to subscribers who wanted them; the magazine still publishes five crosswords monthly: four new puzzles by various setters, and one by Araucaria taken from the extensive 1 Across archive.

He took his pseudonym from the monkey-puzzle tree, whose Latin name is &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;. Another name for this tree is the &quot;Chile Pine&quot;, of which &quot;Cinephile&quot; is an anagram, demonstrating his love for film.

Graham lived in Somersham, Cambridgeshire. He was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2005 New Year&#x27;s Honours, for services to the newspaper industry. In July 2011 Graham was the subject of the BBC radio programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, in which he revealed that he always used &quot;Scrabble&quot; tiles as an aid when compiling.

The December 2012 issue of &quot;1 Across&quot; magazine printed an Araucaria puzzle which revealed that Graham had oesophageal cancer. The puzzle was reprinted as &quot;Guardian&quot; cryptic No. 25,842 on 11 January 2013. The puzzle had a supplementary narrative beginning &quot;Araucaria has 18 down of the 19, which is being treated with 13 15&quot;. Those who solved the puzzle found the answer to 18 down was &quot;cancer&quot;, to 19 &quot;oesophagus&quot;, and to 13 and 15 &quot;palliative&quot; and &quot;care&quot;. Other clues had answers such as &quot;Macmillan Nurse&quot;, &quot;stent&quot;, &quot;chemotherapy&quot;, &quot;endoscopy&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot;. Araucaria said this particular puzzle had not taken him very long, adding that a crossword had seemed the most fitting way to make the announcement. &quot;It seemed the natural thing to do somehow,&quot; he said. &quot;It just seemed right.&quot;

The last Araucaria puzzle published before Graham&#x27;s death also had some hidden meanings: it included answers such as &quot;cottage hospital&quot;, &quot;nil by mouth&quot; and &quot;time to go&quot;. Fellow Guardian crossword compiler and friend Sandy Balfour was with Graham on the night of his death, reading to him. A year after his death, on 27 November 2014, The Guardian published a crossword with the grid and some clues compiled by him but completed by his friend and fellow compiler &#x27;Philistine&#x27;. He was described as having a &quot;mischievous erudition, humility and courage.&quot;

==Style==

Graham&#x27;s clue-writing style made him one of the best-loved of all setters. His style falls into a grouping sometimes referred to as &quot;Araucarian&quot;. This style, of which &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Bunthorne was another notable exponent, has influenced most of the current crop of Guardian setters and contrasts with the more rigid &quot;Ximenean&quot; style favoured by &quot;The Times&quot;.

Widely admired for his clever use of cross-references and special themes, he was usually called upon to produce the extra-large puzzles printed in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on bank holidays; these sometimes even included two grids, with complicated rules governing the placing of answers in each.

He is also credited with creating a new format of crossword, the &quot;alphabetical jigsaw&quot; in which the clues are labelled with letters rather than numbers, and the grid has no markers to indicate the placement of solutions. Instead the clues are arranged in alphabetical order of their answer – usually labelled with the beginning letter, with either one or two clues for each letter. The answers are to be placed &quot;jigsaw-wise, however they may fit,&quot; though of course only one arrangement will work. These puzzles have been christened &#x27;araubeticals&#x27; by fans on the crossword website www.fifteensquared.net. Araucaria&#x27;s clues to the alphabetical jigsaws are often in the form of rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter. In a few puzzles, an additional clue is given which describes a phrase or set of words placed around the edge of the grid (alternate squares of the perimeter being black) to give a starting point for placing some of the answers.

His clues often included long anagrams, with his favourite appearing in a Christmas puzzle: 
:&quot;O hark the herald angels sing the boy’s descent which lifted up the world&quot;,
an anagram of &quot;While shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on the ground&quot;.

Another much-quoted example of his brilliance in clue-setting is the following:
:&quot;Poetical scene with surprisingly chaste Lord Archer vegetating (3, 3, 8, 12)&quot;
which yields &quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester&quot;. This is the title of a poem by Rupert Brooke. The anagram was a topical reference to Jeffrey Archer who was the vicarage&#x27;s current owner and was lying low there at the time following a sex scandal.

==Books==
Several collections of his crosswords have been published. His crosswords have also been included in many other compilations, not listed here.

<text>In mathematics, contact geometry is the study of a geometric structure on smooth manifolds given by a hyperplane distribution in the tangent bundle satisfying a condition called &#x27;complete non-integrability&#x27;. Equivalently, such a distribution may be given (at least locally) as the kernel of a differential one-form, and the non-integrability condition translates into a maximal non-degeneracy condition on the form. These conditions are opposite to two equivalent conditions for &#x27;complete integrability&#x27; of a hyperplane distribution, i.e. that it be tangent to a codimension one foliation on the manifold, whose equivalence is the content of the Frobenius theorem.

Contact geometry is in many ways an odd-dimensional counterpart of symplectic geometry, a structure on certain even-dimensional manifolds. Both contact and symplectic geometry are motivated by the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics, where one can consider either the even-dimensional phase space of a mechanical system or constant-energy hypersurface, which, being codimension one, has odd dimension.

==Applications==

Like symplectic geometry, contact geometry has broad applications in physics, e.g. geometrical optics, classical mechanics, thermodynamics, geometric quantization, integrable systems and to control theory. Contact geometry also has applications to low-dimensional topology; for example, it has been used by Kronheimer and Mrowka to prove the property P conjecture, by Michael Hutchings to define an invariant of smooth three-manifolds, and by Lenhard Ng to define invariants of knots. It was also used by Yakov Eliashberg to derive a topological characterization of Stein manifolds of dimension at least six.

Contact geometry has been used to describe the visual cortex.

==Contact forms and structures==

A contact structure on an odd dimensional manifold is a smoothly varying family of codimension one subspaces of each tangent space of the manifold, satisfying a non-integrability condition. The family may be described as a section of a bundle as follows:

Given an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, and a point , a contact element of &quot;M&quot; with contact point &quot;p&quot; is an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional linear subspace of the tangent space to &quot;M&quot; at &quot;p&quot;. A contact element can be given by the kernel of a linear function on the tangent space to &quot;M&quot; at &quot;p&quot;. However, if a subspace is given by the kernel of a linear function ω, then it will also be given by the zeros of λω where is any nonzero real number. Thus, the kernels of all give the same contact element. It follows that the space of all contact elements of &quot;M&quot; can be identified with a quotient of the cotangent bundle T*&quot;M&quot; (with the zero section formula_1 removed), namely:
:formula_2

A contact structure on an odd dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot;, of dimension , is a smooth distribution of contact elements, denoted by &quot;ξ&quot;, which is generic at each point. The genericity condition is that &quot;ξ&quot; is non-integrable.

Assume that we have a smooth distribution of contact elements, &quot;ξ&quot;, given locally by a differential 1-form &quot;α&quot;; i.e. a smooth section of the cotangent bundle. The non-integrability condition can be given explicitly as:
:formula_3
Notice that if &quot;ξ&quot; is given by the differential 1-form &quot;α&quot;, then the same distribution is given locally by , where ƒ is a non-zero smooth function. If &quot;ξ&quot; is co-orientable then &quot;α&quot; is defined globally.

===Properties===
It follows from the Frobenius theorem on integrability that the contact field &quot;ξ&quot; is &quot;completely nonintegrable&quot;. This property of the contact field is roughly the opposite of being a field formed from the tangent planes of a family of nonoverlapping hypersurfaces in &quot;M&quot;. In particular, you cannot find a hypersurface in &quot;M&quot; whose tangent spaces agree with &quot;ξ&quot;, even locally. In fact, there is no submanifold of dimension greater than &quot;k&quot; whose tangent spaces lie in &quot;ξ&quot;.

===Relation with symplectic structures===
A consequence of the definition is that the restriction of the 2-form &quot;ω&quot; = &quot;dα&quot; to a hyperplane in &quot;ξ&quot; is a nondegenerate 2-form. This construction provides any contact manifold &quot;M&quot; with a natural symplectic bundle of rank one smaller than the dimension of &quot;M&quot;. Note that a symplectic vector space is always even-dimensional, while contact manifolds need to be odd-dimensional.

The cotangent bundle &quot;T&quot;*&quot;N&quot; of any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;N&quot; is itself a manifold (of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;) and supports naturally an exact symplectic structure ω = &quot;dλ&quot;. (This 1-form &quot;λ&quot; is sometimes called the Liouville form). There are several ways to construct an associated contact manifold, some of dimension 2&quot;n&quot; − 1, some of dimension 2&quot;n&quot; + 1.

;Projectivization
Let &quot;M&quot; be the projectivization of the cotangent bundle of &quot;N&quot;: thus &quot;M&quot; is fiber bundle over &quot;N&quot; whose fiber at a point &quot;x&quot; is the space of lines in T*&quot;N&quot;, or, equivalently, the space of hyperplanes in T&quot;N&quot;. The 1-form &quot;λ&quot; does not descend to a genuine 1-form on &quot;M&quot;. However, it is homogeneous of degree 1, and so it defines a 1-form with values in the line bundle O(1), which is the dual of the fibrewise tautological line bundle of &quot;M&quot;. The kernel of this 1-form defines a contact distribution.

;Energy surfaces
Suppose that &quot;H&quot; is a smooth function on T*&quot;N&quot;, that &quot;E&quot; is a regular value for &quot;H&quot;, so that the level set formula_4 is a smooth submanifold of codimension 1. A vector field &quot;Y&quot; is called an Euler (or Liouville) vector field if it is transverse to &quot;L&quot; and conformally symplectic, meaning that the Lie derivative of &quot;dλ&quot; with respect to &quot;Y&quot; is a multiple of &quot;dλ&quot; in a neighborhood of &quot;L&quot;.

Then the restriction of formula_5 to &quot;L&quot; is a contact form on &quot;L&quot;.

This construction originates in Hamiltonian mechanics, where &quot;H&quot; is a Hamiltonian of a mechanical system with the configuration space &quot;N&quot; and the phase space &quot;T&quot;*&quot;N&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; is the value of the energy.

;The unit cotangent bundle
Choose a Riemannian metric on the manifold &quot;N&quot; and let &quot;H&quot; be the associated kinetic energy.
Then the level set &quot;H&quot; = 1/2 is the &quot;unit cotangent bundle&quot; of &quot;N&quot;, a smooth manifold of dimension 2&quot;n&quot; − 1 fibering over &quot;N&quot; with fibers being spheres. Then the Liouville form restricted to the unit cotangent bundle is a contact structure. This corresponds to a special case of the second construction, where the flow of the Euler vector field &quot;Y&quot; corresponds to linear scaling of momenta p&quot;s&quot;, leaving the &quot;q&quot;s fixed. The vector field &quot;R&quot;, defined by the equalities
: &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) = 1 and &quot;dλ&quot;(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) = 0 for all vector fields &quot;A&quot;,
is called the Reeb vector field, and it generates the geodesic flow of the Riemannian metric. More precisely, using the Riemannian metric, one can identify each point of the cotangent bundle of &quot;N&quot; with a point of the tangent bundle of &quot;N&quot;, and then the value of &quot;R&quot; at that point of the (unit) cotangent bundle is the corresponding (unit) vector parallel to &quot;N&quot;.

;First jet bundle
On the other hand, one can build a contact manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 by considering the first jet bundle of the real valued functions on &quot;N&quot;. This bundle is isomorphic to &quot;T&quot;*&quot;N&quot;×R using the exterior derivative of a function. With coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;), &quot;M&quot; has a contact structure
:α = &quot;dt&quot; + &quot;λ&quot;.

Conversely, given any contact manifold &quot;M&quot;, the product &quot;M&quot;×R has a natural structure of a symplectic manifold. If α is a contact form on &quot;M&quot;, then

:&quot;ω&quot; = &quot;d&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;t&quot;α)

is a symplectic form on &quot;M&quot;×R, where &quot;t&quot; denotes the variable in the R-direction. This new manifold is called the symplectization (sometimes symplectification in the literature) of the contact manifold &quot;M&quot;.

===Examples===
As a prime example, consider R3, endowed with coordinates (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) and the one-form The contact plane &quot;ξ&quot; at a point (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) is spanned by the vectors and 
By replacing the single variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; with the multivariables &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;, one can generalize this example to any R2&quot;n&quot;+1. By a theorem of Darboux, every contact structure on a manifold looks locally like this particular contact structure on the (2&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional vector space.

The Sasakian manifolds comprise an important class of contact manifolds.

Every connected compact orientable three-dimensional manifold admits a contact structure. This result generalises to any compact almost-contact manifold.

==Legendrian submanifolds and knots==
The most interesting subspaces of a contact manifold are its Legendrian submanifolds. The non-integrability of the contact hyperplane field on a (2&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional manifold means that no 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional submanifold has it as its tangent bundle, even locally. However, it is in general possible to find n-dimensional (embedded or immersed) submanifolds whose tangent spaces lie inside the contact field: these are called Legendrian submanifolds. 

Legendrian submanifolds are analogous to Lagrangian submanifolds of symplectic manifolds. There is a precise relation: the lift of a Legendrian submanifold in a symplectization of a contact manifold is a Lagrangian submanifold. 

The simplest example of Legendrian submanifolds are Legendrian knots inside a contact three-manifold. Inequivalent Legendrian knots may be equivalent as smooth knots; that is, there are knots which are smoothly isotopic where the isotopy cannot be chosen to be a path of Legendrian knots.

Legendrian submanifolds are very rigid objects; typically there are infinitely many Legendrian isotopy classes of embeddings which are all smoothly isotopic. Symplectic field theory provides invariants of Legendrian submanifolds called relative contact homology that can sometimes distinguish distinct Legendrian submanifolds that are topologically identical (i.e. smoothly isotopic).

==Reeb vector field==
If α is a contact form for a given contact structure, the Reeb vector field R can be defined as the unique element of the (one-dimensional) kernel of dα such that α(&quot;R&quot;) = 1. If a contact manifold arises as a constant-energy hypersurface inside a symplectic manifold, then the Reeb vector field is the restriction to the submanifold of the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the energy function. (The restriction yields a vector field on the contact hypersurface because the Hamiltonian vector field preserves energy levels.)

The dynamics of the Reeb field can be used to study the structure of the contact manifold or even the underlying manifold using techniques of Floer homology such as symplectic field theory and, in three dimensions, embedded contact homology. Different contact forms whose kernels give the same contact structure will yield different Reeb vector fields, whose dynamics are in general very different. The various flavors of contact homology depend a priori on the choice of a contact form, and construct algebraic structures the closed trajectories of their Reeb vector fields; however, these algebraic structures turn out to be independent of the contact form, i.e. they are invariants of the underlying contact structure, so that in the end, the contact form may be seen as an auxiliary choice. In the case of embedded contact homology, one obtains an invariant of the underlying three-manifold, i.e. the embedded contact homology is independent of contact structure; this allows one to obtain results that hold for any Reeb vector field on the manifold.

The Reeb field is named after Georges Reeb.

==Some historical remarks==
The roots of contact geometry appear in work of Christiaan Huygens, Isaac Barrow, and Isaac Newton. The theory of contact transformations (i.e. transformations preserving a contact structure) was developed by Sophus Lie, with the dual aims of studying differential equations (e.g. the Legendre transformation or canonical transformation) and describing the &#x27;change of space element&#x27;, familiar from projective duality.

The first known use of the term &quot;contact manifold&quot; appears in a paper of 1958

<doc id="476400" wikidata="Q57554" url="?curid=476400" title="Georg Christoph Lichtenberg">
<text>Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1 July 1742 – 24 February 1799) was a German physicist, satirist, and Anglophile. He was the first person in Germany to hold a professorship explicitly dedicated to experimental physics. He is remembered for his posthumously published notebooks, which he himself called &quot;&quot;, a description modelled on the English bookkeeping term &quot;waste books&quot; or &quot;scrapbooks&quot;, and for his discovery of the tree-like electrical discharge patterns now called Lichtenberg figures.

==Life==
Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was born in Ober-Ramstadt near Darmstadt, Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, the youngest of 17 children. His father, (1689–1751), was a pastor ascending through the ranks of the church hierarchy, who eventually became superintendent for Darmstadt. The mother of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was Henriette Katharina Lichtenberg, nee Eckhardt (1696–1764), daughter of pastor Johann Peter Eckhardt (1659–1702). His maternal aunt Sophie Elisabeth Eckhardt (1693–1742) was married composer and harpsichordist Christoph Graupner (1683–1760). Unusually for a clergyman in those times, he seems to have possessed a fair amount of scientific knowledge. Lichtenberg was educated at his parents&#x27; house until the age of 10, when he joined the Lateinschule in Darmstadt. His intelligence became obvious at a very early age. He wanted to study mathematics, but his family could not afford to pay for lessons. In 1762, his mother applied to Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, who granted sufficient funds. In 1763, Lichtenberg entered the University of Göttingen.
In 1769 he became extraordinary professor of physics, and six years later ordinary professor. He held this post till his death. Invited by his students, he visited England twice, from Easter to early Summer 1770 and from August 1774 to Christmas 1775, where he was received cordially by George III and Queen Charlotte. He led the King through the royal observatory in Richmond, upon which the king proposed that he become professor of philosophy. He also met with participants of Cook&#x27;s voyages. Great Britain impressed him, and he subsequently became a well-known Anglophile.

One of the first scientists to introduce experiments with apparatus in their lectures, Lichtenberg was a popular and respected figure in contemporary European intellectual circles. He was one of the first to introduce Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s lightning rod to Germany by installing such devices in his house and garden sheds. He maintained relations with most of the great figures of that era, including Goethe and Kant. In 1784, Alessandro Volta visited Göttingen especially to see him and his experiments. Mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss sat in on his lectures. 

Alexander von Humboldt was a student of Lichtenberg in Gottingen.

In 1793 he was elected a member of the Royal Society.

Lichtenberg was prone to procrastination. He failed to launch the first hydrogen balloon. He always dreamed of writing a novel à la Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, but never finished more than a few pages.

Philosophically Lichtenberg was most influenced by Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant, the latter of which he exchanged letters with.

Lichtenberg became a hunchback as a child owing to a malformation of his spine suffered from a fall. This left him unusually short, even by 18th-century standards. Over time, this malformation grew worse, ultimately affecting his breathing.

===Personal life===
In 1777, he met Maria Stechard, then aged 13, who lived with the professor permanently after 1780. She died in 1782. Their relationship was made into a novel by Gert Hofmann, which was translated by his son Michael Hofmann into English with the title &quot;Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl&quot;.

In 1783, the year after Stechard&#x27;s death, Lichtenberg met Margarethe Kellner (1768–1848). He married her in 1789, to give her a pension, as he thought he was to die soon. They had six children: Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1786–1845), Louise Wilhelmina Lichtenberg (1789–1802), Agnes Lichtenberg (1793–1820), Augusta Friederike Lichtenberg (1795–1837), Heinrich August Lichtenberg (1797–1836) and Christian Wilhelm Lichtenberg (1799–1860), and she outlived him by 49 years.

In 1799, Lichtenberg died in Göttingen after a short illness at the age of 56.

===Brothers and sisters===
At Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was 17 brothers and sisters, most of whom died in infancy.
* Klara Sophie Lichtenberg (1718–1780)
* Gottlieb Christoph Lichtenberg (1724–1756) – Office Secretary in Grünstadt and Bailiff in Seeheim, was married Sophie Dorothea Wißmann (1722–1792), widow of bailiff Georg Alexander Campen (1704–1752), his son was Head of Government in Grand Duchy of Hesse (1755–1819), among his grandchildren was Administrative Officer in Grand Duchy of Hesse (1784–1845).
* Christian Friedrich Lichtenberg (1734–1790) – Oberappellationsrat and Secret Tribunal Council, unmarried.
* (1737–1812) – Geheimer Archivarius in Gotha and Geheimer Assistenzrat, unmarried.

==Scrap books==

The &quot;scrapbooks&quot; (&quot;Sudelbücher&quot; in German) are notebooks, in the tradition of commonplace books or waste books, which Lichtenberg kept from his student days until the end of his life. Each volume was accorded a letter of the alphabet from A, which began in 1765, to L, which broke off at Lichtenberg&#x27;s death in 1799.

These notebooks first became known to the world after the man&#x27;s death, when the first and second editions of &quot;Lichtenbergs Vermischte Schriften&quot; (1800–06 and 1844–53) were published by his sons and brothers. After the initial publications, however, notebooks G and H, and most of notebook K, were destroyed or disappeared. Those missing parts are believed to have contained sensitive materials. The manuscripts of the remaining notebooks are preserved in Göttingen University.

The notebooks contain quotations of passages that struck Lichtenberg (like his recension of the supercentenarian Francesco Hupazoli&#x27;s life), titles of books to read, autobiographical sketches, and short or long reflections, including keen observations on human nature, in the manner of the 17th-century French moralists. Those reflections helped him earn his posthumous fame as one of the best aphorists in Western intellectual history. Some scholars have attempted to distill a system of thought of Lichtenberg&#x27;s scattered musings, but he was not a professional philosopher, and had no need to present, or to conceive, a consistent philosophy.

The scrapbooks reveal a critical and analytical way of thinking and emphasis on experimental evidence in physics, through which he became one of the early founders and advocates of modern scientific methodology.
The more experience and experiments are accumulated during the exploration of nature, the more faltering its theories become. It is always good though not to abandon them instantly. For every hypothesis which used to be good at least serves the purpose of duly summarizing and keeping all phenomena until its own time. One should lay down the conflicting experience separately, until it has accumulated sufficiently to justify the efforts necessary to edifice a new theory. (Lichtenberg: scrapbook JII/1602) Lichtenberg, an atheist, satirized religion saying &quot;I thank the Lord a thousand times for having made me become an atheist.&quot;

==Other works==
As a satirist, Lichtenberg takes high rank among the German writers of the 18th century. His biting wit involved him in many controversies with well-known contemporaries, such as the Swiss physiognomist Johann Kaspar Lavater whose science of physiognomy he ridiculed, and Johann Heinrich Voss, whose views on Greek pronunciation called forth a powerful satire, &quot;Über die Pronunciation der Schöpse des alten Griechenlandes&quot;. For Laurence Sterne&#x27;s wit on the bigotry of the clergy, in his novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, Lichtenberg condemned him as a &quot;scandalum ecclesiae&quot; (a scandal for the Church).

In 1777, Lichtenberg opposed the apparent misrepresentation of science by Jacob Philadelphia. Lichtenberg considered him to be a magician, not a physicist, and created a satirical poster that was intended to prevent Philadelphia from performing his exhibition in Göttingen. The placard, called “Lichtenberg&#x27;s Avertissement,” described extravagant and miraculous tricks that were to be performed. As a result, Philadelphia left the city without a performance.

Based on his visits to England, his &quot;Briefe aus England&quot;, with admirable descriptions of David Garrick&#x27;s acting, are the most attractive of his writings published during his lifetime.
From 1778 onward, Lichtenberg published the &quot;Göttinger Taschen Calender&quot; and contributed to the &quot;Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Literatur&quot;, which he edited for three years (1780–1782) with J. G. A. Forster. The &quot;Göttinger Taschen Calender&quot;, beside being a usual Calendar for everyday usage, contained not only short writings on natural phenomena and new scientific discoveries (which would be termed popular science today), but also essays in which he contested quackery and superstition. It also contained attacks on the “Sturm und Drang” writers. In the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, he strove to educate the common people to use logic, wit and the power of their own senses.

In 1784 he took over the publication of the textbook &quot;Anfangsgründe der Naturlehre&quot; (&quot;Foundations of the Natural Sciences&quot;) from his friend and colleague Johann Christian Erxleben upon his premature death in 1777. Until 1794, three further editions followed, which for many years, remained the standard textbook for physics in German.

From 1794 to 1799 he published an &quot;Ausführliche Erklärung der Hogarthischen Kupferstiche&quot;, in which he described the satirical details in William Hogarth&#x27;s prints.

==Legacy==
Lichtenberg&#x27;s notebooks later garnered him a reputation among many notable German-speaking thinkers and it is for these that he is today mainly remembered. Arthur Schopenhauer admired Lichtenberg greatly for what he had written in his notebooks. He called him one of those who &quot;think ... for their own instruction&quot;, who are &quot;genuine &#x27;thinkers for themselves&#x27; in both senses of the words&quot;. Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote that &quot;Lichtenberg’s wit is the flame that can burn on a pure candle only&quot; and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe favourably remarked that &quot;We can use Lichtenberg&#x27;s writings as the most marvelous divining-rod; where he makes a joke, a problem lies hidden&quot;.

Other admirers of Lichtenberg&#x27;s notebooks include Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Jacques Barzun. Sigmund Freud (in his &quot;Why War?” letter to Albert Einstein) mentioned Lichtenberg&#x27;s invention of a &quot;Compass of Motives&quot; in a discussion on the combination of human compounded motives and quoted him as saying, &quot;The motives that lead us to do anything might be arranged like the thirty-two winds and might be given names on the same pattern: for instance, &#x27;food-food-fame&#x27; or &#x27;fame-fame-food&#x27;.”

Lichtenberg is not read by many outside Germany. Leo Tolstoy held Lichtenberg&#x27;s writings in high esteem, expressing his perplexity of &quot;why the Germans of the present day neglect this writer so much.&quot; 
The Chinese scholar and wit Qian Zhongshu quotes the &quot;Scrapbooks&quot; in his works several times.

As a physicist, Lichtenberg is remembered for his investigations in electricity, for discovering branching discharge patterns on dielectrics, now called Lichtenberg figures. In 1777, he built a large electrophorus to generate static electricity through induction. One of the largest made, it was in diameter and could produce sparks. With it, he discovered the basic principle of modern xerography copy machine technology. By discharging a high voltage point near an insulator, he was able to record strange, tree-like patterns in fixed dust. These Lichtenberg figures are considered today to be examples of fractals.

A crater on the Moon is named Lichtenberg in his honour. 7970 Lichtenberg, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1960 is named after him.

He proposed the standardized paper size system used globally today except in Canada and the US defined by ISO 216, from which A4 is the most commonly used size.

Robert Wichard Pohl, a 20th-century successor of Lichtenberg in Göttingen and one of the founders of solid state physics used a similar research programme, in which the experiment was an essential part of narrating scientific knowledge.

<text>Tobolsk (, ; ) is a town in Tyumen Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Tobol and Irtysh rivers. Founded in 1590, Tobolsk is the second-oldest Russian settlement east of the Ural Mountains in Asian Russia, and was the historic capital of the Siberia region. Population: 

==History==
===Conquest of Khanate of Sibir===
The town was founded on the site of the Tatar town of Bitsik-Tura. In 1580, a group of Yermak Timofeyevich&#x27;s Cossacks initiated the Russian conquest of Siberia, pushing eastwards on behalf of the Tsardom of Russia. After a year of Tatar attacks, Yermak prepared for the conquest of the Khanate of Sibir and a campaign to take the Khanate&#x27;s capital city, Qashliq. The Cossacks conquered the city on 26 October 1582, sending Kuchum into retreat. Despite the conquest, Kuchum regrouped his remaining forces and formed a new army, launching a surprise attack on 6 August 1584, killing Yermak. There were a series of battles over Qashliq, and it passed between Tatar and Cossack control, before the city was finally abandoned in 1588. Kuchum was eventually defeated by the Cossacks in 1598 at the Battle of Urmin near the River Ob, ending the Khanate of Sibir. The Russians had established control over the western Siberia region.

===Founding of Tobolsk and Imperial Russian era===
Tobolsk was founded in 1587 by a group of Cossacks under the command of near the ruins of Qashliq. (Years of fighting had left Qashliq almost totally destroyed.) Tobolsk would become the center of the conquest of Siberia. To the north Beryozovo (1593) and Mangazeya (1600-01) were built to bring the Nenets under tribute, while to the east Surgut (1594) and Tara (1594) were established to protect Tobolsk and subdue the ruler of the Tatars. Of these settlements, Mangazeya was the most prominent, and it was used as a base for further exploration eastward.

The new city of Tobolsk, the second Russian town founded in Siberia (after Tyumen), was named after the Tobol River. It was situated at its confluence with the Irtysh River, where the Irtysh turns from flowing westward to flowing northward. Tobolsk grew quickly, based on the importance of the Siberian river routes, and it prospered on trade with China to the east and with Bukhara to the south.

In 1708 Tobolsk was designated as the capital of the newly-established Siberia Governorate; the first school, theater, and newspaper in Siberia were founded here. During the Great Northern War, soldiers of the defeated Swedish army at Battle of Poltava in 1709 were sent in large numbers as prisoners of war to Tobolsk. The Swedes numbered about 25% of the total population and were popular among locals for their contributions to the city. A building of the Tobolsk Kremlin was named the Swedish Chamber in their honor. Many of them were not repatriated until the 1720s, while some of them settled permanently in Tobolsk.

In 1719, Russian authorities began administrative reforms that resulted in Tobolsk&#x27;s political importance declining as the Siberia Governorate&#x27;s massive territory was gradually decentralized. New provinces were organized or territory was transferred to other governorates. By 1782 the Siberia Governorate was abolished and its remaining area split into two viceroyalties, with Tobolsk becoming the capital of the Tobolsk Viceroyalty. In 1796, Tobolsk became the capital of Tobolsk Governorate, and remained the seat of the Governor-General of Western Siberia until the seat moved to Omsk in the 1820s or 1830s. Acknowledging the authority of Tobolsk, many Western Siberian towns - including Omsk, Tyumen, and Tomsk - had their original coats of arms display the Tobolsk insignia, which Omsk continues to honor . After the Decembrist Revolt in 1825, some of the Decembrists deported to Siberia settled in Tobolsk. In the 1890s the importance of Tobolsk declined further after the Trans-Siberian Railway line between Tyumen and Omsk bypassed the city to the south.

In the early 1900s Tobolsk was noted as the administrative center of home province of Grigori Rasputin, a faith-healer who had great influence with the Romanov Imperial family. The city is located close to his birthplace Pokrovskoye. The town was also famous for confectionery companies run by Karelian immigrants.

===Soviet era===
In March 1917, the February Revolution forced the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, ending the Russian Empire. In August the new Provisional Government evacuated the imperial family and their retinue to Tobolsk to live in the former house of the Governor-General. With the October Revolution three months later, the Russian Civil War began, and the Bolsheviks quickly came to power in Tobolsk. After troops of the opposing White Army approached the city in the spring of 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the imperial family west to Yekaterinburg. They were executed there in July 1918, together with several of their retainers.

Following the Bolshevik victory and the formation of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, administrative reforms in 1920 resulted in the abolition of Tobolsk Governorate and the end of 218 years of Tobolsk serving as a provincial capital. Instead, the city became the administrative center of its own uyezd (county), Tobolsky District, in the new Tyumen Province. From 1921 to 1922, Tobolsk was a site of massive anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings across Western Siberia by peasants associated with the Green Army. On November 3, 1923, the city became part of Ural Oblast; on January 7, 1932, it was transferred to Omsk Oblast. From January 17, 1934, the city was part of Obsko-Irtysh Oblast, until it was abolished on December 7 that year and transferred to Omsk Oblast. On August 14, 1944, Tobolsk was transferred to Tyumen Oblast.

A 2004 American book said a 1982 explosion in Tobolsk was caused by CIA sabotage. A former KGB officer said that the explosion was caused by improper installation. On July 10, 1987, by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the city of Tobolsk was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour.

===Recent history===
On November 4, 1996, Tobolsk became an independent city with town status when it was separated from Tobolsky District by the Tyumen Oblast Duma.

In 2013, Tobolsk-Polymer opened the largest polypropylene production facility in Russia as part of an initiative to create a large petrochemical complex in the city. Tobolsk has also become a popular location for tourism in Siberia due to its historical importance, architecture, and natural landscapes. It is an important educational center of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the seat of Tobolsk Diocese, the first Orthodox diocese in Siberia.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tobolsk serves as the administrative center of Tobolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with one urban-type settlement, incorporated separately as the Town of Tobolsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Tobolsk is incorporated as Tobolsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==

The economy of modern Tobolsk centers on a major oil refinery and the petrochemical industry. Some traditional crafts, such as bone-carving, are also preserved. The main factory of the town and Tyumen oblast&#x27; is Sibur holding. It is also the biggest employer of the region.

The town is connected with other cities of Tyumen oblast&#x27; and other Russian regions by trains, buses and since September 24, 2021 by air.

==Climate==
Tobolsk has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). Winters are very cold with average temperatures from to in January, while summers are mild with average July temperatures from . Precipitation is moderate and is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year.

==Demographics==
Ethnic composition (2010):
* Russians – 76.4%
* Tatars – 16.8%
* Ukrainians – 1.9%
* Azerbaijanis – 0.8%
* Others – 4.1%

==Main sights==
Tobolsk is the only town in Siberia and one of the few in Russia which has a standing stone &quot;kremlin&quot; (Tobolsk Kremlin): an elaborate city-fortress from the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. Its white walls and towers with an ensemble of churches and palatial buildings spectacularly sited on a high river bank were proclaimed a national historical and architectural treasure in 1870.

The principal monuments in the kremlin are the Cathedral of St. Sophia (1683–1686), a merchant courtyard (1703–1705), an episcopal palace (1773–1775; now a museum of local lore), and the so-called Swedish Chamber, with six baroque halls (1713–1716). The town contains some remarkable baroque and Neoclassical churches from the 18th and 19th centuries. Also noteworthy is a granite monument to Yermak Timofeyevich, constructed to a design by Alexander Brullov in 1839. The town&#x27;s vicinity is rich in ancient kurgans and pagan shrines, some of which date back to the 10th century BCE.

The Governor&#x27;s Mansion, built in 1790, is a historical monument protected by the Russian federal government. It is built in the architectural style of classicism and one of the first stone buildings built in the city. It is best known as having housed the last Tsar, Nicholas II, and his family after he abdicated the throne they were sent to exile by the Provisional Government. The family was then moved to Yekaterinburg where they were later slaughtered.

<text>Abbécourt () is a commune in the Aisne department in the Hauts-de-France region of northern France.

==Geography==
The commune is located some 3 kilometres south-west of the city of Chauny and is part of the Canton of Chauny.

Access to the commune is by the D1032 road that links Noyon to Saint-Quentin passing through the north of the commune but not through the village. The village is connected to the D1032 by the D437 which branches from the D7 north of the commune and goes south to the village then continues to Manicamp as the D922. The D338 comes from Chauny and joins the D1032 in the commune.

The commune is traversed by the railway line from Creil to Jeumont. The nearest railway station serving the town is that of Chauny but previously there was a station serving the commune from TAC (Transport Agglomération Chaunoise).

===Delimitation and hydrography===
The commune lies in the Drainage basin of the Seine river and is, in large part, delimited by rivers. To the west, it is delimited by the Vigny stream; to the east, by the Ru de Pontoise, and to the south the Oise river. Other rivers that run through the commune are the Brouage and the Canal latéral à l&#x27;Oise. The Canal de l&#x27;Oise a l&#x27;Aisne starts in the commune going south-east at right-angles from the Canal latéral.

===Geology and terrain===
Abbécourt is located in the Paris Basin. Most of the commune&#x27;s subsoil dates from the Upper Cretaceous, when the Paris basin was covered with seawater. The altitude of the municipality varies from 38 metres to 64 metres, with an average of 45 metres of altitude. The seismic risk is very low.

===Climate===
Abbécourt like all of Picardy is subject to an oceanic climate gradient. The climate survey is similar to that of Saint-Quentin, which is located 29.2 kilometres north in a straight line.

==Toponymy==
The name of the area was attested in the form of &quot;Abecurt&quot; in 1151.

This spelling is a form of &quot;-court&quot; characteristic of the Middle Ages and the north of France. The word &quot;court&quot; (&quot;curt&quot; or &quot;cort&quot; in old French) once meant &quot;barnyard, farm, or rural area&quot; (parallel to the German word &quot;hof&quot; cf. German. Hof &quot;farm yard&quot;). It is derived from the Low Latin &quot;cōrtem&quot;, or the Gallo-Roman &quot;CURTE&quot;, derived from the classical Latin &quot;cohors&quot; or &quot;cohortis&quot;. The word &quot;cour&quot; from which it derives, has a different spelling by analogy with the Latin &quot;curia&quot;.

The &quot;-court&quot; suffix is usually preceded by a Germanic personal name under the old French &quot;case regime&quot;, but here this is not the case as evidenced by the old forms: &quot;abbé-&quot; is based on the low Latin abbas meaning &quot;priest&quot;, which gives an overall meaning of &quot;priest&#x27;s rural area&quot;.

Abbécourt should not be confused with Abbecourt (or &quot;Abbatis curtis&quot; in 1224).

==History==

===Origin===
The commune developed from the Abbey Saint-Médard de Soissons, which also gave its name to a farm located within the commune. The earliest historical mentions of Abbécourt date back to the 9th century.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, the commune was a lordship with its own castle and lords. In 1265 a hogshead of wheat was levied annually on the mill and the lordship by the monks of the Abbey of Genlis. This Abbey currently stands at Villequier-Aumont. In 1405 the lordship was purchased by the Lord of Genlis, Jean de Hangest. In 1457, the region experienced a period of pestilence and in 1471, a period of famine.

===Modern Age===
In 1579 the lord of Crosne, Pierre Brulard, purchased the land of Abbécourt from the Lord of Genlis.
In 1581, a land register of Abbécourt was drawn up by letters patent granted by the King and the Secretary of State. During the period of the Fronde, the village was pillaged by the Spanish during the siege of Chauny in 1652. Abbécourt was again attached to the marquisate of Genlis in 1645, but separated once again in 1685 when it came under the abbey of Saint-Medard until 1736. It then finally was returned to the marquisate of Genlis until the French Revolution. In 1774 the marquisate became the Duchy of Villequier-Aumont. On the eve of the revolution, the actual commune was under the administration of Soissons under the bailiwick of Chauny. The Abbécourt parish was attached to the bishopric of Noyon.

===Contemporary period===
With the Revolution, Abbécourt became an independent commune within the district of Chauny and the canton of the same name. During the Six Days&#x27; Campaign in 1814, the Prussian General Bülow&#x27;s troops crossed the commune, pillaging the houses, to counter the offensive movements of Napoleon I. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the village was under German occupation.

Early in World War I, beginning on 1 September 1914, Abbécourt found itself once again occupied by German forces, who put in place a new municipal administrator and mayor. Facing an advancing British army, the German forces destroyed the village on 19 March 1917 during their retreat toward the Hindenburg Line. In the March 1918 German offensive, Abbécourt was again occupied on 24 March 1918. The village was finally liberated on 6 September 1918. Following the war, through an order issued on 17 October 1920, the commune of Abbécourt received the Croix de Guerre.

==Administration==

===Municipal administration===
Following the 2008 municipal elections, the Abbécourt council consisted of 11 councilors, including the mayor of the commune. This number of councillors was defined by the results of the census of 1999 when the town had 447 inhabitants. The outgoing mayor, René Paris, was re-elected after these elections.
