<text>Baron Bagot, of Bagot&#x27;s Bromley in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created on 12 October 1780 for Sir William Bagot, 6th Baronet.

==Bagot family==
The Bagot family has held land in Staffordshire since at least the 11th century. One member of the family, Hervey Bagot, represented Staffordshire in Parliament and fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. He was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1626 and on 31 May 1627 he was created a baronet, of Blithfield Hall, in the County of Staffordshire, in the Baronetage of England. His son (the second Baronet), grandson (third Baronet) and great-grandson (fourth Baronet) also represented Staffordshire in the House of Commons.

The latter&#x27;s son, the fifth Baronet, sat as a Member of Parliament for Staffordshire as well as for Newcastle-under-Lyme and Oxford University. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Baronet. He represented Staffordshire in Parliament as a Tory from 1754 to 1780. In the latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Bagot, of Bagot&#x27;s Bromley in the County of Stafford. His grandson, the third Baron, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Denbighshire and after entering the House of Lords served as a government whip under the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli.

On the death of his son, the fourth Baron, the line of the eldest son of the first Baron failed. The titles passed to his second cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the son of Vice-Admiral Henry Bagot, third son of the Right Reverend the Hon. Richard Bagot, Bishop of Oxford and of Bath and Wells, fifth son of the first Baron. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the son of Reverend Lewis Richard Charles Bagot, eldest son of Reverend Charles Walter Bagot, fourth son of the aforementioned Richard Bagot, fifth son of the first Baron. When he died the titles were inherited by his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He was the son of Charles Frederick Heneage Bagot, fourth son of Reverend Charles Walter Bagot (see above). On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baron, and then to their half-brother, the ninth Baron. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the tenth Baron, who succeeded in 2001.

Since 30 June 2006, the present Baron Bagot has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is not therefore on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. However, the case is under review by the Registrar of the Baronetage.

The ancestral seat of the Bagot family is Blithfield Hall in Staffordshire. A junior branch of the Bagot family had their seat at Pype Hayes Hall, Warwickshire. Another junior branch have their seat at Levens Hall, Cumbria.

==Coat of arms==
The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the barony is: &quot;Ermine, two chevrons azure&quot;. This can be translated as: a white shield with black ermine spots, over the top two thin blue chevrons. Crest: &quot;out of a ducal coronet of five leaves or, a goat&#x27;s head argent, armed gold&quot;; supporters: &quot;two goats argent, armed and bearded or&quot;; motto: &quot;Antiquum Obtinens&quot; &quot;possessing antiquity&quot;.

<doc id="474345" wikidata="Q419102" url="?curid=474345" title="Hsp70">
<text>The 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (Hsp70s or DnaK) are a family of conserved ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins. Proteins with similar structure exist in virtually all living organisms. Intracellularly localized Hsp70s are an important part of the cell&#x27;s machinery for protein folding, performing chaperoning functions, and helping to protect cells from the adverse effects of physiological stresses. Additionally, membrane-bound Hsp70s have been identified as a potential target for cancer therapies and their extracellularly localized counterparts have been identified as having both membrane-bound and membrane-free structures.

== Discovery ==

Members of the Hsp70 family are very strongly upregulated by heat stress and toxic chemicals, particularly heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, etc. Heat shock was originally discovered by Ferruccio Ritossa in the 1960s when a lab worker accidentally boosted the incubation temperature of Drosophila (fruit flies). When examining the chromosomes, Ritossa found a &quot;puffing pattern&quot; that indicated the elevated gene transcription of an unknown protein. This was later described as the &quot;Heat Shock Response&quot; and the proteins were termed the &quot;Heat Shock Proteins&quot; (Hsps).

== Structure ==

The Hsp70 proteins have three major functional domains:

* N-terminal ATPase domain – binds ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and hydrolyzes it to ADP (Adenosine diphosphate). The NBD (nucleotide binding domain) consists of two lobes with a deep cleft between them, at the bottom of which nucleotide (ATP and ADP) binds. The exchange of ATP and ADP leads to conformational changes in the other two domains.
* Substrate binding domain – is composed of a 15 kDa β sheet subdomain and a 10 kDa helical subdomain. The β sheet subdomain consists of stranded β sheets with upward protruding loops, as a typical β barrel, which enclose the peptide backbone of the substrate. SBD contains a groove with an affinity for neutral, hydrophobic amino acid residues. The groove is long enough to interact with peptides up to seven residues in length. 
* C-terminal domain – rich in alpha helical structure acts as a &#x27;lid&#x27; for the substrate binding domain. The helical subdomain consists of five helices, with two helices packed against two sides of the β sheet subdomain, stabilizing the inner structure. In addition, one of the helix forms a salt bridge and several hydrogen bonds to the outer Loops, thereby closing the substrate-binding pocket like a lid. Three helices in this domain form another hydrophobic core which may be stabilization of the &quot;lid&quot;. When an Hsp70 protein is ATP bound, the lid is open and peptides bind and release relatively rapidly. When Hsp70 proteins are ADP bound, the lid is closed, and peptides are tightly bound to the substrate binding domain.

Protein phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, helps to regulate protein function and involves the phosphorylation of amino acids with hydroxyl groups in their side chains (among eukaryotes). Serine, threonine, and tyrosine amino acids are common targets of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Hsp70 has become a point of greater exploration in scientific literature relatively recently. A 2020 publication suggests that phosphorylation of a serine residue between the NBD and substrate binding domain in yeast Hsp70s leads to a dramatic reduction of the normal Hsp70 heat shock response. This deactivation via phosphorylation of a protein is a common motif in protein regulation, and demonstrates how relatively small changes to protein structure can have biologically significant effects on protein function.

== Function ==

The Hsp70 system interacts with extended peptide segments of proteins as well as partially folded proteins to cause aggregation of proteins in key pathways to downregulate activity. When not interacting with a substrate peptide, Hsp70 is usually in an ATP bound state. Hsp70 by itself is characterized by a very weak ATPase activity, such that spontaneous hydrolysis will not occur for many minutes. As newly synthesized proteins emerge from the ribosomes, the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 recognizes sequences of hydrophobic amino acid residues, and interacts with them. This spontaneous interaction is reversible, and in the ATP bound state Hsp70 may relatively freely bind and release peptides. However, the presence of a peptide in the binding domain stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70, increasing its normally slow rate of ATP hydrolysis. When ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP the binding pocket of Hsp70 closes, tightly binding the now-trapped peptide chain. Further speeding ATP hydrolysis are the so-called J-domain cochaperones: primarily Hsp40 in eukaryotes, and DnaJ in prokaryotes. These cochaperones dramatically increase the ATPase activity of Hsp70 in the presence of interacting peptides.

By binding tightly to partially synthesized peptide sequences (incomplete proteins), Hsp70 prevents them from aggregating and being rendered nonfunctional. Once the entire protein is synthesized, a nucleotide exchange factor (prokaryotic GrpE, eukaryotic BAG1 and HspBP1 are among those which have been identified) stimulates the release of ADP and binding of fresh ATP, opening the binding pocket. The protein is then free to fold on its own, or to be transferred to other chaperones for further processing. HOP (the Hsp70/Hsp90 Organizing Protein) can bind to both Hsp70 and Hsp90 at the same time, and mediates the transfer of peptides from Hsp70 to Hsp90.

Hsp70 also aids in transmembrane transport of proteins, by stabilizing them in a partially folded state. It is also known to be phosphorylated which regulates several of its functions.

Hsp70 proteins can act to protect cells from thermal or oxidative stress. These stresses normally act to damage proteins, causing partial unfolding and possible aggregation. By temporarily binding to hydrophobic residues exposed by stress, Hsp70 prevents these partially denatured proteins from aggregating, and inhibits them from refolding. Low ATP is characteristic of heat shock and sustained binding is seen as aggregation suppression, while recovery from heat shock involves substrate binding and nucleotide cycling. In a thermophile anaerobe (&quot;Thermotoga maritima&quot;) the Hsp70 demonstrates redox sensitive binding to model peptides, suggesting a second mode of binding regulation based on oxidative stress.

Hsp70 seems to be able to participate in disposal of damaged or defective proteins. Interaction with CHIP (&quot;C&quot;arboxyl-terminus of &quot;H&quot;sp70 &quot;I&quot;nteracting &quot;P&quot;rotein)–an E3 ubiquitin ligase–allows Hsp70 to pass proteins to the cell&#x27;s ubiquitination and proteolysis pathways.

Finally, in addition to improving overall protein integrity, Hsp70 directly inhibits apoptosis. One hallmark of apoptosis is the release of cytochrome c, which then recruits Apaf-1 and dATP/ATP into an apoptosome complex. This complex then cleaves procaspase-9, activating caspase-9 and eventually inducing apoptosis via caspase 3 activation. Hsp70 inhibits this process by blocking the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the Apaf-1/dATP/cytochrome c apoptosome complex. It does not bind directly to the procaspase-9 binding site, but likely induces a conformational change that renders procaspase-9 binding less favorable. Hsp70 is shown to interact with Endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor protein IRE1alpha thereby protecting the cells from ER stress - induced apoptosis. This interaction prolonged the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA thereby inducing transcriptional upregulation of targets of spliced XBP-1 like EDEM1, ERdj4 and P58IPK rescuing the cells from apoptosis. Other studies suggest that Hsp70 may play an anti-apoptotic role at other steps, but is not involved in Fas-ligand-mediated apoptosis (although Hsp 27 is). Therefore, Hsp70 not only saves important components of the cell (the proteins) but also directly saves the cell as a whole. Considering that stress-response proteins (like Hsp70) evolved before apoptotic machinery, Hsp70&#x27;s direct role in inhibiting apoptosis provides an interesting evolutionary picture of how more recent (apoptotic) machinery accommodated previous machinery (Hsps), thus aligning the improved integrity of a cell&#x27;s proteins with the improved chances of that particular cell&#x27;s survival.

In mice, exogenous recombinant human Hsp70 (eHsp70), delivered intranasally, increases lifespan. Although the maximum lifespan increased only moderately, the overall mortality rate in treated animals was much lower compared with the control group. Also this eHsp70-treatment improves learning and memory of mice in old age, increases their curiosity.

== Cancer ==

Hsp70 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma and underexpressed in renal cell cancer.
In breast cancer cell line (MCF7) has been found that not only Hsp90 interacted with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) but also Hsp70-1 and Hsc70 interacted with ERα too.

Given the role of heat shock proteins as an ancient defense system for stabilizing cells and eliminating old and damaged cells, this system has been co-opted by cancer cells to promote their growth. Increased Hsp70 in particular has been shown to inhibit apoptosis of cancer cells, and increased Hsp70 has been shown to be associated with or directly induce endometrial, lung, colon, prostate, and breast cancer, as well as leukemia. Hsp70 in cancer cells may be responsible for tumorigenesis and tumor progression by providing resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of Hsp70 has been shown to reduce the size of tumors and can cause their complete regression. Hsp70/Hsp90 is a particularly attractive target for therapeutics, because it is regulated by the inhibition of its ATPase activity, while other HSPs are regulated by nucleotides. Several inhibitors have been designed for Hsp70 that are currently in clinical trials, though as of now HSP90 inhibitors have been more successful. In addition, Hsp70 has been shown to be a regulator of the immune system, activating the immune system as an antigen. Thus, tumor-derived Hsp70 has been suggested as a potential vaccine or avenue to target for immunotherapy. Given the increased expression of Hsp70 in cancer, it has been suggested as a biomarker for cancer prognostics, with high levels portending poor prognosis. An oncogenic mechanism illustrates how extracellular vesicles expressing HSP70 are produced by proliferative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells and can target and compromise a healthy hematopoiesis system during leukemia development.

== Expression in skin tissue ==

Both Hsp70 and HSP47 were shown to be expressed in dermis and epidermis following laser irradiation, and the spatial and temporal changes in HSP expression patterns define the laser-induced thermal damage zone and the process of healing in tissues. Hsp70 may define biochemically the thermal damage zone in which cells are targeted for destruction, and HSP47 may illustrate the process of recovery from thermally induced damage. HSP70 helps in protecting skin against the increased melanin and wrinkled formation induced due to UV exposure.

== Neurodegeneration ==

Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to Hsp70 and Hsp40 upregulation, which can channel misfolded protein for proteasome degradation, which can potentially inhibit the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, Hsp70 overexpression in human neuroglioma cells transfected with mutant alpha-synuclein led to 50% less oligomeric alpha-synuclein species, pointing towards the possibility that increasing its expression could diminish the spread of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Similarly, Hsp70 overexpression suppressed poly-Q dependent aggregation and neurodegeneration in cell cultures, yeast, fly, and mouse models, and deletion of hsp70 increased the size of polyQ inclusion bodies, suggesting that increasing its expression could help to prevent Huntington&#x27;s disease. Similarly, reductions in Hsp70 have been shown in transgenic mouse models of ALS and patients with sporadic ALS. Lastly, increased expression or activity of Hsp70 has been proposed as a method to prevent the progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, because knock down of Hsp70 promoted A-beta toxicity, and Hsp70 was shown to promote tau stability, while Hsp70 levels are decreased in tauopathies like Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Given the complex interplay between the different chaperone proteins, therapeutic development in this field is aimed at investigating how the chaperone network as a whole can be manipulated and the effect of this manipulation on the progression of neurodegenerative disease, but the balance of Hsp70 and Hsp90 levels appears to be central in this pathophysiology.

== In diabetes ==

The fluctuations in the levels of chaperone HSP70 affect the homeostasis. Diabetes leads to several microvasculature and microvasculature diseases like retinopathy, Toll like receptors are integral part of innate immune system and eHSP70 binds to toll like receptors and activates the MyD88 pathway, further stimulating NF-kB, cytokines like TNFα and IL1 β, increased production of reactive oxygen species contributing to insulin resistance and diabetes. Whereas there is decrease in the levels of iHSP70.

== In cardiovascular diseases ==

HSP70 is a chaperone with ubiquitous presence. It is crucial in the cardiovascular system. HSP70 normally aids in protein folding and aggregation; when present in the cell, functioning as an anti-inflammatory molecule; however, under stress conditions, it is localized to the extracellular milieu, where it is involved in inducing inflammatory pathways and contributes to disease pathogenesis. It is well established that intracellular HSP70 (iHSP70) levels play a protective role, whereas extracellular HSP70 (eHSP70) levels in circulating blood are linked to pathophysiology in micro and microvasculature, which results in a variety of cardiovascular illnesses. HSP70 homologues identified in human cytosol includes HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA1L, HSPA12B, HSPA13, HSPA14 whereas HSPA9 in mitochondria. The HSP70 acts as DAMP and activates innate immune response which as involved in cardiovascular disease progression.

The chaperone protein acts as auto antigen in atherosclerosis. Increased oxidative stress causes the formation of high-density oxidized LDL, the first event in the formation of plaque. This activates HSP70 and its promoter in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells, which contributes to atherosclerosis by inducing JAK/STAT pathway expression.

HSP70 is also linked to high blood pressure, a worldwide concern and risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension causes endothelial dysfunction and vascular wall damage, both of which contribute to arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis. HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L are three genes in humans that encode HSP70, and their polymorphism is linked to the onset of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin II, endothelin-1, or phenylepinephrine cause HSP70 overexpression, which activates several molecular pathways, resulting in increased production of ROS, CRP, IL-10, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 These inflammatory signals interfere with the antioxidant machinery and results in rapid disease progression.

HSP70 expression increases after the coronary bypass surgery. Exercise has a positive and protective impact on cardiovascular disorders and stimulates the increased production of chaperone protein together known to be cardioprotective.

== Family members ==

Prokaryotes express three Hsp70 proteins: DnaK, HscA (Hsc66), and HscC (Hsc62).

Eukaryotic organisms express several slightly different Hsp70 proteins. All share the common domain structure, but each has a unique pattern of expression or subcellular localization. These are, among others:
* Hsc70 (Hsp73/HSPA8) is a constitutively expressed chaperone protein. It typically makes up one to three percent of total cellular protein.
* Hsp70 (encoded by three very closely related paralogs: HSPA1A, HSPA1B, and HSPA1L) is a stress-induced protein. High levels can be produced by cells in response to hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and changes in pH.
* Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP or Grp78) is a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in protein folding there, and can be upregulated in response to stress or starvation.
* mtHsp70 or Grp75 is the mitochondrial Hsp70.

The following is a list of human Hsp70 genes and their corresponding proteins:
HSP70s are found in many plants including Arabidopsis, soybean (&quot;Glycine max&quot;), barley (&quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot;) and wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;).

=== Hsps 90 and 110 ===

Hsp90s are essential for protein remodeling, similar to Hsp70 proteins, and play an especially vital role in eukaryotes, where it has been suggested that Hsp90 interacts with the DnaK system (composed of DnaK, GrpE, and either DnaJ or CbpA) to facilitate the process of protein remodeling. In E. coli, Hsp90s works collaboratively with Hsp70s to facilitate protein remodeling and activation. Hsp90Ec and DnaK are chaperones of Hsp90 and Hsp70, respectively. DnaK initially binds and stabilizes the misfolded protein before working collaboratively with Hsp90Ec to refold this substrate and cause its activation. Given conditions of excess DnaK, this chaperone has been found to inhibit remodeling of proteins. However, the presence of Hsp90Ec can mitigate this effect and enable protein remodeling despite conditions of excess DnaK.

The Hsp70 superfamily also includes a family of Hsp110/Grp170 (Sse) proteins, which are larger proteins related to Hsp70. The Hsp110 family of proteins have divergent functions: yeast Sse1p has little ATPase activity but is a chaperone on its own as well as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70, while the closely related Sse2p has little unfoldase activity.

The following is a list of currently named human HSP110 genes. HSPH2-4 are proposed names and the current name is linked:

<doc id="474347" wikidata="Q3075680" url="?curid=474347" title="Foundation and Chaos">
<text>Foundation and Chaos (1998) is a science fiction novel by Greg Bear, set in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe. It is the second book of the Second Foundation trilogy, which was written after Asimov&#x27;s death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate.

==Plot summary==

The novel is the second part of the Second Foundation Trilogy and takes place almost entirely in the same time frame as &quot;The Psychohistorians&quot;, which is the first part of the novel &quot;Foundation&quot;. In addition to telling a more expanded version of Hari Seldon&#x27;s confrontation with the Commission of Public Safety, it also interweaves R. Daneel Olivaw&#x27;s struggle against a sect of robots who oppose his plans for humanity.

While covering the same period as in Asimov’s &quot;The Psychohistorians&quot;, &quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot; focuses more on paternal super-robot R. Daneel Olivaw than on Hari Seldon. Olivaw’s 20 millennia of machinations and contrivances are questioned by “Calvinian” robots who do not observe Olivaw’s Zeroth Law (“No robot may harm humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm”) developed in Asimov’s &quot;Robots and Empire.&quot; Olivaw’s actions dampen human intellectual growth and variation until the human species matures. The novel’s primary issue is whether Olivaw’s ends justify his means. Does the ancient Auroran robot really serve humanity’s greater good? Should Olivaw decide this for himself?

Seldon seems unaware of Olivaw’s role in perpetuating brain fever and other dampeners. But Seldon would probably approve, considering his quarantining of the New Renaissance worlds when Seldon served as Imperial 1st Minister.

&quot;Foundation and Chaos&quot; portrays the rise of mentalics (telepaths who can influence other’s thoughts) such as Wanda Seldon and Stettin Palver, who will form the Second Foundation. Twisted rogue mentalic Vara Liso even foreshadows the mutant Magnifico’s spectacular rise 310 years later. Powerful Public Safety Commissioner Linge Chen again plays a prominent role as the true Imperial power behind fatuous playboy Emperor Klayus. Reconstructed super-robot Dors Venabili appears as well.

<doc id="474349" wikidata="Q3124890" url="?curid=474349" title="Foundation's Triumph">
<text>Foundation&#x27;s Triumph (1999) is a science fiction novel by American writer David Brin, set in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe. It is the third book of the Second Foundation trilogy, which was written after Asimov&#x27;s death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate. Brin synthesizes dozens of Foundation-Empire-Robots novels and short stories by Isaac Asimov, Roger MacBride Allen, and authorized others into a consistent framework. &quot; Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot; includes an appendix chronology compiled by Attila Torkos.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Foundation’s Triumph&quot; starts with Hari Seldon who reviews his life and has to accept the fact that his “purpose” is completed. One day he meets a bureaucrat, Horis Antic, who explains his theory about the correlation of certain soils on planets and psychohistory. Seldon agrees to take a trip to some of the planets which fit Antic&#x27;s theory. Hari and Horis travel to Demarchia, where they rent a yacht.

Parallel to Seldon&#x27;s story, Dors Venabili starts out on the planet Panucopia to meet Lodovik Trema, a robot whose Three Laws of Robotics have been erased. Lodovic gives her the head of R. Giskard Reventlov, an important robot who founded the Zeroth Law with R. Daneel Olivaw. She finds out that Giskard and Daneel never consulted a human while founding the Zeroth Law.
Later Trema meets a faction of cyborgs and joins them. After Dors has become a rebel, she fights for the cyborgs as well.

The third plot of the novel takes place on the planet Eos. Daneel talks to his possible successor Zun Lurrin. All chapters with Olivaw as the main character are printed in a different typeface.

In Seldon&#x27;s story, during the flight to the first planet the yacht is taken over by rebels, who are from the renaissance or chaos planet Ktlina. They show Seldon ancient spaceships with many data capsules from the human past.
Robots take over the yacht and destroy the data capsules and the ancient ships with the permission of Seldon. During the flight back to Trantor, a rebel, Gornon Vlimt, turns out to be another robot from a faction of Calvinians, who want to send Hari into the future.

At last all factions meet on Earth. The Calvinians are stopped by Daneel and Wanda Seldon. Old friends Seldon and Daneel meet one final time, to discuss philosophy. Despite the apparent eventual dominance of Galaxia, Seldon confides his belief that the second Galactic Empire will include both the two Foundations, following the Seldon Plan, and Galaxia. &quot;Will there be an Encyclopedia Galactica a thousand years from now,&quot; asks Seldon, betting that if his belief is correct, there will be regularly updated editions of it. Since most Foundation novels use the Encyclopedia as a framing device for its chapters, this implies that Seldon correctly predicted the successful synthesis of the two Foundations and Galaxia.

==Possible sequel==
Brin stated in his book that he could well imagine to write a sequel to &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, or that another author might. He refrained from giving any details on what was on his mind, but also noted that he might release a rough start one day, which he later did on his website, titled &quot;Denouement&quot;.

<doc id="474350" wikidata="Q6649896" url="?curid=474350" title="Little Egypt (dancer)">
<text>Little Egypt was the stage name for at least three popular belly dancers from the late 1800s through the early 1900s. With countless imitators, the name became synonymous with belly dancers.

==Fahreda Mazar Spyropoulos==
Fahreda Mazar Spyropoulos, (c. 1871 – April 5, 1937), also performing under the stage name Fatima, had her start at the Bird Cage Theatre in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. In the reopened saloon&#x27;s lobby hangs a larger-than-life sized painting she donated entitled &quot;Fatima&quot;. It bears six patched bullet holes; one can be seen above the belly button and a knife gash in the canvas below the knee. 

In 1893, Spyropoulos went to Chicago to appear at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Raqs dancers performed for the first time in the United States at the Egyptian Theater on the fair&#x27;s Midway. Sol Bloom presented the show &quot;The Algerian Dancers of Morocco&quot; at the attraction &quot;A Street in Cairo&quot; produced by Gaston Akoun, which included Spyropoulos, though she was neither Egyptian nor Algerian, but Syrian. The melody that accompanied her dance became famous as the Snake Charmer song. Spyropoulos, the wife of a Chicago restaurateur and businessman who was a native of Greece, was billed as Fatima, but because of her size, she had been called &quot;Little Egypt&quot; as a backstage nickname.

Her husband&#x27;s name was Alexander Spyropoulos. His restaurant&#x27;s name was The America and it was located at 705 S. Halsted, in Chicago. They lived together at 1338 s Fairfield Ave. They married in 1906. They had no children. [Chicago Tribune, February 2nd, 1983]

Spyropoulos gained wide attention, and popularized this form of dancing, which came to be referred to as the &quot;Hoochee-Coochee&quot;, or the &quot;shimmy and shake&quot;. At that time the word &quot;belly dance&quot; had not yet entered the American vocabulary, as Spyropoulos was the first in the U.S. to demonstrate the &quot;danse du ventre&quot; (literally &quot;dance of the belly&quot;) first seen by the French during Napoleon&#x27;s incursions into Egypt at the end of the 18th century.

Some time after Spyropoulos went to Europe, she performed under the stage name &quot;Little Egypt.&quot;

Subsequently, several female dancers adopted the name Little Egypt and toured the United States performing some variation of this dance, until the name became somewhat synonymous with exotic dancers, and was often associated with the Dance of the Seven Veils. Spyropoulos then claimed to be original Little Egypt from the Chicago Fair. Recognized as the true Little Egypt, she disliked being confused with Ashea Wabe, after Wabe&#x27;s performance at the Seeley banquet in 1896 ended up in her arrest and a full-scale New York City scandal.

Spyropoulos danced as Little Egypt at the 1933 Century of Progress in Chicago at the age of 62.

At the time of her death, she had filed suit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the use of her name in the motion picture &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, claiming that the producers of the movie failed to ask for her consent.

==Ashea Wabe==
Montreal-born Ashea Wabe (1871 – January 3, 1908) became front-page news in 1896 after she danced at the swank Fifth Avenue bachelor party for Herbert Seeley. A rival promoter reported that Wabe planned to dance nude and the party was raided by the vice squad. Though the raid precluded Wabe from completing her act, she nonetheless admitted to local authorities that she had been paid to dance and pose &quot;in the all-together&quot;, a euphemism for having no clothes on. Theodore Roosevelt, then a New York City Police Commissioner, supported the police captain who conducted the raid and was subsequently vilified by the city media for interfering with a party held by upstanding gentlemen. Only later was it revealed that Wabe (a.k.a. Little India) had every intention of performing in the nude and would have done so had the police raid not occurred.

The raid brought some amount of fame to Wabe. In fact, she was hired by Broadway impresario Oscar Hammerstein I to appear as herself in a humorous parody of the Seeley dinner.

On January 5, 1908, she was found dead in her apartment at 236 West 37th Street, New York City, by her sister, having most likely died from gas asphyxiation. She was said to have left an estate of over $200,000.

==Fatima Djamile==
Fatima Djemille (d. March 14, 1921) appeared at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair.

Fatima was the subject of two early films, Edison&#x27;s &quot;Coochee Coochee Dance&quot; (1896) and &quot;Fatima&quot; (1897).

== Lorraine Shalhoub ==
Lorraine Shalhoub (born December 20, 1931, in Brooklyn) used the name Little Egypt for her acting career.

===Film and television===
*The American Mutoscope and Biograph Company released three short reels in 1897 with a dancer billed as Little Egypt.
*In the 1940 Mae West movie &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; there is a humorous reference to Little Egypt in the dialogue between West&#x27;s character &quot;Flower Belle&quot;, substituting as a teacher, and an elderly pupil called &quot;Pop&quot;. 
*&quot;Little Egypt&quot; is a highly fictionalized 1951 film about the legendary World&#x27;s Fair dancer, produced by Universal International, and starring Rhonda Fleming in the title role.
*In the second episode of the TV series &quot;The Waltons&quot;, Grandpa Walton says he saw Little Egypt at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair.

::&quot;She kinda looks like Tempest Storm&quot; &quot;And she can dance like Little Egypt&quot;
::&quot;She works down at the snake farm&quot;

===Literature===
&quot;Loving Little Egypt&quot; is the title of a Thomas McMahon novel, set in the late 19th century.

<text>Baron Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1780 for the soldier and politician Charles FitzRoy. He was the third son of Lord Augustus FitzRoy, second son of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, while Prime Minister Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton was his elder brother. Lord Southampton was also the great-great-grandson (through an illegitimate line) of King Charles II by his mistress Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. The Southampton title had previously been created for Charles FitzRoy, eldest natural son of Charles II and the Duchess of Cleveland and the elder brother of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, but had become extinct in 1774 on the death of his son William FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Cleveland and 2nd Duke of Southampton, six years before the creation of the barony of Southampton.

The first Baron Southampton&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron, notably served as Lord-Lieutenant of Northamptonshire from 1867 to 1872. Lord Southampton was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. He held the title for 86 years and 144 days, the fourth longest time anyone has held a peerage (the others being the 7th Marquess Townshend 88 years, the 13th Lord Sinclair, 87 years, and the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu (86 years and 155 days)). His son, the fifth Baron, disclaimed the title on 16 March 1964. Since 2015 the title has been held by his grandson, the seventh Baron.

Several other members of this branch of the FitzRoy family also gained distinction. Henry FitzRoy, second son of the second Baron, was a politician. Edward FitzRoy, second son of the third Baron, served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1928 until his death in 1943. In 1943 his widow was created Viscountess Daventry in his honour. William FitzRoy (1830–1902), a great-grandson of the first Baron, was a major-general in the army.

==Barons Southampton (1780)==
*Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton (1737–1797)
*George Ferdinand FitzRoy, 2nd Baron Southampton (1761–1810)
*Charles FitzRoy, 3rd Baron Southampton (1804–1872)
*Charles Henry FitzRoy, 4th Baron Southampton (1867–1958)
*Charles FitzRoy, 5th Baron Southampton (1904–1989) (disclaimed 1964)
*Charles James FitzRoy, 6th Baron Southampton (1928–2015)
*Edward Charles FitzRoy, 7th Baron Southampton (b. 1955)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son The Hon. Charles Edward Millett FitzRoy (b. 1983).

<doc id="474353" wikidata="Q7254447" url="?curid=474353" title="Pseudo-spectral method">
<text>Pseudo-spectral methods, also known as discrete variable representation (DVR) methods, are a class of numerical methods used in applied mathematics and scientific computing for the solution of partial differential equations. They are closely related to spectral methods, but complement the basis by an additional pseudo-spectral basis, which allows representation of functions on a quadrature grid. This simplifies the evaluation of certain operators, and can considerably speed up the calculation when using fast algorithms such as the fast Fourier transform.

==Motivation with a concrete example==

Take the initial-value problem

:formula_1

with periodic conditions formula_2. This specific example is the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a potential formula_3, but the structure is more general. In many practical partial differential equations, one has a term that involves derivatives (such as a kinetic energy contribution), and a multiplication with a function (for example, a potential).

In the spectral method, the solution formula_4 is expanded in a suitable set of basis functions, for example plane waves,

:formula_5

Insertion and equating identical coefficients yields a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients,

:formula_6

where the elements formula_7 are calculated through the explicit Fourier-transform

:formula_8

The solution would then be obtained by truncating the expansion to formula_9 basis functions, and finding a solution for the formula_10. In general, this is done by numerical methods, such as Runge–Kutta methods. For the numerical solutions, the right-hand side of the ordinary differential equation has to be evaluated repeatedly at different time steps. At this point, the spectral method has a major problem with the potential term formula_3.

In the spectral representation, the multiplication with the function formula_3 transforms into a vector-matrix multiplication, which scales as formula_13. Also, the matrix elements formula_7 need to be evaluated explicitly before the differential equation for the coefficients can be solved, which requires an additional step.

In the pseudo-spectral method, this term is evaluated differently. Given the coefficients formula_10, an inverse discrete Fourier transform yields the value of the function formula_4 at discrete grid points formula_17. At these grid points, the function is then multiplied, formula_18, and the result Fourier-transformed back. This yields a new set of coefficients formula_19 that are used instead of the matrix product formula_20.

It can be shown that both methods have similar accuracy. However, the pseudo-spectral method allows the use of a fast Fourier transform, which scales as formula_21, and is therefore significantly more efficient than the matrix multiplication. Also, the function formula_3 can be used directly without evaluating any additional integrals.

==Technical discussion==

In a more abstract way, the pseudo-spectral method deals with the multiplication of two functions formula_3 and formula_24 as part of a partial differential equation. To simplify the notation, the time-dependence is dropped. Conceptually, it consists of three steps:

# formula_25 are expanded in a finite set of basis functions (this is the spectral method).
# For a given set of basis functions, a quadrature is sought that converts scalar products of these basis functions into a weighted sum over grid points.
# The product is calculated by multiplying formula_26 at each grid point.

===Expansion in a basis===

The functions formula_27 can be expanded in a finite basis formula_28 as

:formula_29
:formula_30

For simplicity, let the basis be orthogonal and normalized, formula_31 using the inner product formula_32 with appropriate boundaries formula_33. The coefficients are then obtained by

:formula_34
:formula_35

A bit of calculus yields then

:formula_36

with formula_37. This forms the basis of the spectral method. To distinguish the basis of the formula_38 from the quadrature basis, the expansion is sometimes called Finite Basis Representation (FBR).

===Quadrature===

For a given basis formula_39 and number of formula_40 basis functions, one can try to find a quadrature, i.e., a set of formula_40 points and weights such that

:formula_42

Special examples are the Gaussian quadrature for polynomials and the Discrete Fourier Transform for plane waves. It should be stressed that the grid points and weights, formula_43 are a function of the basis &quot;and&quot; the number formula_9.

The quadrature allows an alternative numerical representation of the function formula_45 through their value at the grid points. This representation is sometimes denoted Discrete Variable Representation (DVR), and is completely equivalent to the expansion in the basis.

:formula_46
:formula_47

===Multiplication===

The multiplication with the function formula_3 is then done at each grid point,

:formula_49

This generally introduces an additional approximation. To see this, we can calculate one of the coefficients formula_50:

:formula_51

However, using the spectral method, the same coefficient would be formula_52. The pseudo-spectral method thus introduces the additional approximation

:formula_53

If the product formula_54 can be represented with the given finite set of basis functions, the above equation is exact due to the chosen quadrature.

==Special pseudospectral schemes==

===The Fourier method===

If periodic boundary conditions with period formula_55 are imposed on the system, the basis functions can be generated by plane waves,

:formula_56

with formula_57, where formula_58 is the ceiling function.

The quadrature for a cut-off at formula_59 is given by the discrete Fourier transformation. The grid points are equally spaced, formula_60 with spacing formula_61, and the constant weights are formula_62.

For the discussion of the error, note that the product of two plane waves is again a plane wave, formula_63 with formula_64. Thus, qualitatively, if the functions formula_65 can be represented sufficiently accurately with formula_66 basis functions, the pseudo-spectral method gives accurate results if formula_67 basis functions are used.

An expansion in plane waves often has a poor quality and needs many basis functions to converge. However, the transformation between the basis expansion and the grid representation can be done using a Fast Fourier transform, which scales favorably as formula_68. As a consequence, plane waves are one of the most common expansion that is encountered with pseudo-spectral methods.

===Polynomials===

Another common expansion is into classical polynomials. Here, the Gaussian quadrature is used, which states that one can always find weights formula_69 and points formula_70 such that

:formula_71

holds for any polynomial formula_72 of degree formula_73 or less. Typically, the weight function formula_74 and ranges formula_33 are chosen for a specific problem, and leads to one of the different forms of the quadrature. To apply this to the pseudo-spectral method, we choose basis functions formula_76, with formula_77 being a polynomial of degree formula_78 with the property

:formula_79

Under these conditions, the formula_38 form an orthonormal basis with respect to the scalar product formula_32. This basis, together with the quadrature points can then be used for the pseudo-spectral method.

For the discussion of the error, note that if formula_82 is well represented by formula_83 basis functions and formula_84 is well represented by a polynomial of degree formula_85, their product can be expanded in the first formula_86 basis functions, and the pseudo-spectral method will give accurate results for that many basis functions.

Such polynomials occur naturally in several standard problems. For example, the quantum harmonic oscillator is ideally expanded in Hermite polynomials, and Jacobi-polynomials can be used to define the associated Legendre functions typically appearing in rotational problems.

<text>Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (also known as aspartate transcarbamoylase or ATCase) catalyzes the first step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway ().

In &quot;E. coli&quot;, the enzyme is a multi-subunit protein complex composed of 12 subunits (300 kDa in total). The composition of the subunits is C6R6, forming 2 trimers of catalytic subunits (34 kDa) and 3 dimers of regulatory subunits (17 kDa). The particular arrangement of catalytic and regulatory subunits in this enzyme affords the complex with strongly allosteric behaviour with respect to its substrates. The enzyme is an archetypal example of allosteric modulation of fine control of metabolic enzyme reactions.

ATCase does not follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Instead, it lies between its low-activity, low-affinity &quot;tense&quot; and its high-activity, high-affinity &quot;relaxed&quot; states. The binding of substrate to the catalytic subunits results in an equilibrium shift towards the R state, whereas binding of CTP to the regulatory subunits results in an equilibrium shift towards the T state. Binding of ATP to the regulatory subunits results in an equilibrium shift towards the R state.

==Reaction==

ATCase is a highly regulated enzyme that catalyses the first committed step in pyrimidine biosynthesis, the condensation of L-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The catalysis by ATCase serves as the rate limiting step in pyrimidine biosynthesis because it alters its catalytic velocity in response to cellular levels of both pyrimidines and purines. The end-product of the pyrimidine pathway, CTP, decreases catalytic velocity, whereas ATP, the end-product of the parallel purine pathway, increases catalytic velocity.
==Structure==
The discussion of structure, catalytic center, and allosteric site that follows is based on the prokaryotic version of ATCase, specifically &quot;E. coli&quot;&#x27;s.

Early studies demonstrated that ATCase consists of two different kinds of polypeptide chains, which have different roles. The catalytic subunits catalyze the carbamylation of the amino group of aspartate but do not have regulatory properties, while the regulatory subunits do not have any catalytic activity but contain the regulatory sites for effector binding. The ATCase holoenzyme is made of two catalytic trimers that are in contact and held together by three regulatory dimers, so the native form of the enzyme contains six chains of each type, with a total molecular weight of 310 kDa.

Each of the catalytic domains is composed of two structural domains, the aspartate domain, which contains most of the residues responsible for binding aspartate, and the carbamoyl phosphate domain, which contains most of the residues that bind to carbamoyl phosphate. Each regulatory domain is also composed of two domains, the allosteric domain, which has the binding site for the nucleotide effectors, and the zinc domain, consisting of four cysteine residues clustered in its C-terminal region. These residues coordinate a zinc atom that is not involved in any catalytic property, but has been shown to be essential for the association of regulatory and catalytic subunits.

The three-dimensional arrangement of the catalytic and regulatory subunits involves several ionic and hydrophobic stabilizing contacts between amino acid residues. Each catalytic chain is in contact with three other catalytic chains and two regulatory chains. Each regulatory monomer is in contact with one other regulatory chain and two catalytic chains. In the unliganded enzyme, the two catalytic trimers are also in contact.

== Catalytic center ==
The catalytic site of ATCase is located at the interface between two neighboring catalytic chains in the same trimer and incorporates amino acid side-chains from both of these subunits. Insight into the mode of binding of substrates to the catalytic center of ATCase was first made possible by the binding of a bisubstrate analogue, N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA). This compound is a strong inhibitor of ATCase and has a structure that is thought to be very close to that of the transition state of the substrates. Additionally, crystal structures of ATCase bound to carbamoylphosphate and succinate have been obtained. These studies, in addition to investigations using site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids, have identified several residues that are crucial for catalysis, such as Ser52, Thr53, Arg54, Thr55, Arg105, His134, Gln137, Arg167, Arg229, Glu231, and Ser80 and Lys84 from an adjacent catalytic chain. The active site is a highly positively charged pocket. One of the most critical side-chains is from Arg54, which interacts with a terminal oxygen and the anhydride oxygen of carbamoyl phosphate, stabilizing the negative charge of the leaving phosphate group. Arg105, His134, and Thr55 help to increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon by interacting with the carbonyl oxygen. In general, the rate enhancement of ATCase is achieved by orientation and stabilization of substrates, intermediates, and products rather than by direct involvement of amino acid residues in the catalytic mechanism.

== Allosteric site ==
The allosteric site in the allosteric domain of the R chains of the ATCase complex binds to the nucleotides ATP, CTP and/or UTP. There is one site with high affinity for ATP and CTP and one with 10- to 20-fold lower affinity for these nucleotides in each regulatory dimer. ATP binds predominantly to the high-affinity sites and subsequently activates the enzyme, while UTP and CTP binding leads to inhibition of activity. UTP can bind to the allosteric site, but inhibition of ATCase by UTP is possible only in combination with CTP. With CTP present, UTP binding is enhanced and preferentially directed to the low-affinity sites. On the converse, UTP binding leads to enhanced affinity for CTP at the high-affinity sites and together they inhibit enzyme activity by up to 95%, while CTP binding alone inhibits activity to 50% to 70%.
Comparison of the crystal structures of the T and R forms of ATCase show that it swells in size during the allosteric transition, and that the catalytic subunits condense during this process. The two catalytic trimers move apart along the threefold axis by 12 Å, and they rotate about this axis by 5° each, ultimately leading to a reorientation of the regulatory subunits around their twofold axis by 15°. This quaternary structure change is associated with alterations in inter-subunit and inter-domain interactions. The interaction between subunits C1-C4 and R1 is extensively modified during this conversion. In particular, there is large movement of amino acid residues 230–254, known collectively as the 240s loop. These residues are located at the cleft between the carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate domains at the C1-C4 interface. The overall outcome of these structural changes is that the two domains of each catalytic chain come closer together, ensuring a better contact with the substrates or their analogues.

During this structural transition, some interactions between side-chains are lost and some others are established. Studies have confirmed that the position of the 240s loop directly affects substrate binding in the corresponding active site. Earlier studies using site-directed mutagenesis of the 240s loop showed that interactions between Asp271 and Tyr240, and between Glu239 of C1 and Tyr165 of C4 would stabilize the T-state, while interactions between Glu239 of C1 and both Lys164 and Tyr165 of C4 would stabilize the R-state.

Located close to the 240s loop and the active site, the loop region encompassing residues 160–166 plays a role in both the internal architecture of the enzyme and its regulatory properties. In particular, the residue Asp162 interacts with Gln231 (known to be involved in aspartate binding), and binds the same residues in both the T and R states. A mutant that had this residue mutated to alanine showed a huge reduction in specific activity, a two-fold decrease in the affinity for aspartate, a loss of homotropic cooperativity, and decreased activation by ATP. It was suggested that the change in the overall structure caused by the introduction of this residue affects other residues in the R1-C1, R1-C4 and C1-C4 interfaces, which are involved in the quaternary structure transition.

==Assembly of the complex==
The regulatory and catalytic subunits exist as fused protein homologs, providing strong evidence that they would interact together. Two catalytic trimers and two regulatory dimers assemble to form an intermediate of aspartate carbamoyltransferase consisting of 6 catalytic subunits and 4 regulatory subunits.

<text>Józef Marian Chełmoński (7 November 1849 – 6 April 1914) was a Polish painter of the realist school with roots in the historical and social context of the late Romantic period in partitioned Poland. He is famous for monumental paintings now at the Sukiennice National Art Gallery in Kraków and at the MNW in Warsaw.

==Life==
Chełmoński was born in the village of Boczki near Łowicz in central Congress Poland under the Russian military control. His first drawing teacher was his father Józef Adam (a small leaseholder and administrator of Boczki village). His mother was Izabela née Łoskowska. After finishing high school in Warsaw, Józef studied in Warsaw Drawing Class (1867–1871) and took private lessons from Wojciech Gerson. From 1871 to 1874 Chełmoński lived in Munich. He worked with Polish painters assembled around Jozef Brandt and Maksymilian Gierymski. There, he also studied for a few months at the academy of H. Anschutz and A. Strahuber. In 1872 and 1874 Chełmoński visited the Polish Territories (Poland, as an independent country, did not exist during this time), Tatra Mountains and Ukraine.

His first paintings were done under the influence of Gerson. The works that followed were landscapes and villages. In 1875 Chełmoński went to Paris, where he had many important exhibitions and became known to the art scene. With many orders, the artistic level of his paintings decreased.

From 1878 to 1887 Chełmoński visited Poland, Vienna and Venice. In 1887 he returned to Poland and in 1889 settled in the village of Kuklówka Zarzeczna. Contact with his homeland and nature are qualities revealed in his artworks. From that time are the best liked, or the most beloved of Chełmoński&#x27;s paintings are paintings such as &quot;Partridge on the Snow&quot;, &quot;The Storks&quot; or &quot;Before Thunderstorm&quot;.

Chełmoński represented the trend in art called &quot;Polish Patriotic Painting&quot;. He died in Kuklówka near Grodzisk Mazowiecki in 1914.

<doc id="474363" wikidata="Q898365" url="?curid=474363" title="Glycosylation">
<text>Glycosylation is the reaction in which a carbohydrate (or &#x27;glycan&#x27;), i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor) in order to form a glycoconjugate. In biology (but not always in chemistry), glycosylation usually refers to an enzyme-catalysed reaction, whereas glycation (also &#x27;non-enzymatic glycation&#x27; and &#x27;non-enzymatic glycosylation&#x27;) may refer to a non-enzymatic reaction.

Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum undergo glycosylation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the &quot;O&quot;-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced:
* &quot;N&quot;-linked glycans attached to a nitrogen of asparagine or arginine side-chains. &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation requires participation of a special lipid called dolichol phosphate.
* &quot;O&quot;-linked glycans attached to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine, threonine, tyrosine, hydroxylysine, or hydroxyproline side-chains, or to oxygens on lipids such as ceramide.
* Phosphoglycans linked through the phosphate of a phosphoserine.
*&quot;C&quot;-linked glycans, a rare form of glycosylation where a sugar is added to a carbon on a tryptophan side-chain. Aloin is one of the few naturally occurring substances.
* Glypiation, which is the addition of a GPI anchor that links proteins to lipids through glycan linkages.

== Purpose ==
Glycosylation is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to a target macromolecule, typically proteins and lipids. This modification serves various functions. For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated. In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine residues. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, &quot;N&quot;-linked glycans mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the immune system) via sugar-binding proteins called lectins, which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties. Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Glycosylation also underpins the ABO blood group system. It is the presence or absence of glycosyltransferases which dictates which blood group antigens are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to zoonotic transmission of viruses. In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the human immunodeficiency virus.

Overall, glycosylation needs to be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures that have shaped it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as cell trafficking). However, it is more likely that diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. &quot;Helicobacter&quot; attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.

Glycosylation can also modulate the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the proteins.

==Glycoprotein diversity==

Glycosylation increases diversity in the proteome, because almost every aspect of glycosylation can be modified, including:
*Glycosidic bond—the site of glycan linkage
*Glycan composition—the types of sugars that are linked to a given protein
*Glycan structure—can be unbranched or branched chains of sugars
*Glycan length—can be short- or long-chain oligosaccharides

== Mechanisms ==

There are various mechanisms for glycosylation, although most share several common features:
*Glycosylation, unlike glycation, is an enzymatic process. Indeed, glycosylation is thought to be the most complex post-translational modification, because of the large number of enzymatic steps involved. 
*The donor molecule is often an activated nucleotide sugar.
*The process is non-templated (unlike DNA transcription or protein translation); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, cisternae in Golgi apparatus). Therefore, glycosylation is a site-specific modification.

== Types ==

=== &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation ===

&quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation is a very prevalent form of glycosylation and is important for the folding of many eukaryotic glycoproteins and for cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix attachment. The &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation process occurs in eukaryotes in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and widely in archaea, but very rarely in bacteria. In addition to their function in protein folding and cellular attachment, the &quot;N&quot;-linked glycans of a protein can modulate a protein&#x27;s function, in some cases acting as an on/off switch.

=== &quot;O&quot;-linked glycosylation ===

&quot;O&quot;-linked glycosylation is a form of glycosylation that occurs in eukaryotes in the Golgi apparatus, but also occurs in archaea and bacteria.

=== Phosphoserine glycosylation ===
Xylose, fucose, mannose, and GlcNAc phosphoserine glycans have been reported in the literature. Fucose and GlcNAc have been found only in &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, mannose in &quot;Leishmania mexicana&quot;, and xylose in &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;. Mannose has recently been reported in a vertebrate, the mouse, &quot;Mus musculus&quot;, on the cell-surface laminin receptor alpha dystroglycan4. It has been suggested this rare finding may be linked to the fact that alpha dystroglycan is highly conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals.

=== &quot;C&quot;-mannosylation ===

A mannose sugar is added to the first tryptophan residue in the sequence W–X–X–W (W indicates tryptophan; X is any amino acid). A C-C bond is formed between the first carbon of the alpha-mannose and the second carbon of the tryptophan. However, not all the sequences that have this pattern are mannosylated. It has been established that, in fact, only two thirds are and that there is a clear preference for the second amino acid to be one of the polar ones (Ser, Ala, Gly and Thr) in order for mannosylation to occur. Recently there has been a breakthrough in the technique of predicting whether or not the sequence will have a mannosylation site that provides an accuracy of 93% opposed to the 67% accuracy if we just consider the WXXW motif.

Thrombospondins are one of the proteins most commonly modified in this way. However, there is another group of proteins that undergo &quot;C&quot;-mannosylation, type I cytokine receptors. &quot;C&quot;-mannosylation is unusual because the sugar is linked to a carbon rather than a reactive atom such as nitrogen or oxygen. In 2011, the first crystal structure of a protein containing this type of glycosylation was determined—that of human complement component 8. Currently it is established that 18% of human proteins, secreted and transmembrane undergo the process of C-mannosylation. Numerous studies have shown that this process plays an important role in the secretion of Trombospondin type 1 containing proteins which are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum if they do not undergo C-mannosylation This explains why a type of cytokine receptors, erythropoietin receptor remained in the endoplasmic reticulum if it lacked C-mannosylation sites.

=== Formation of GPI anchors (glypiation) ===
Glypiation is a special form of glycosylation that features the formation of a GPI anchor. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also prenylation.)

=== Chemical glycosylation ===
Glycosylation can also be effected using the tools of synthetic organic chemistry. Unlike the biochemical processes, synthetic glycochemistry relies heavily on protecting groups (e.g. the 4,6-&quot;O&quot;-benzylidene) in order to achieve desired regioselectivity. The other challenge of chemical glycosylation is the stereoselectivity that each glycosidic linkage has two stereo-outcomes, α/β or &quot;cis&quot;/&quot;trans&quot;. Generally, the α- or &quot;cis&quot;-glycoside is more challenging to synthesis. New methods have been developed based on solvent participation or the formation of bicyclic sulfonium ions as chiral-auxiliary groups.

=== Non-enzymatic glycosylation ===
The non-enzymatic glycosylation is also known as glycation or non-enzymatic glycation. It is a spontaneous reaction and a type of post-translational modification of proteins meaning it alters their structure and biological activity. It is the covalent attachment between the carbonil group of a reducing sugar (mainly glucose and fructose) and the amino acid side chain of the protein. In this process the intervention of an enzyme is not needed. It takes place across and close to the water channels and the protruding tubules.

At first, the reaction forms temporary molecules which later undergo different reactions (Amadori rearrangements, Schiff base reactions, Maillard reactions, crosslinkings...) and form permanent residues known as Advanced Glycation end-products (AGEs).

AGEs accumulate in long-lived extracellular proteins such as collagen which is the most glycated and structurally abundant protein, especially in humans. Also, some studies have shown lysine may trigger spontaneous non-enzymatic glycosylation.

==== Role of AGEs ====
AGEs are responsible for many things. These molecules play an important role especially in nutrition, they are responsible for the brownish color and the aromas and flavors of some foods. It is demonstrated that cooking at high temperature results in various food products having high levels of AGEs.

Having elevated levels of AGEs in the body has a direct impact on the development of many diseases. It has a direct implication in diabetes mellitus type 2 that can lead to many complications such as: cataracts, renal failure, heart damage... And, if they are present at a decreased level, skin elasticity is reduced which is an important symptom of aging.

They are also the precursors of many hormones and regulate and modify their receptor mechanisms at the DNA level.

==Deglycosylation==
There are different enzymes to remove the glycans from the proteins or remove some part of the sugar chain.
* α2-3,6,8,9-Neuraminidase (from Arthrobacter ureafaciens): cleaves all non-reducing terminal branched and unbranched sialic acids.
* β1,4-Galactosidase (from Streptococcus pneumoniae): releases only β1,4-linked, nonreducing terminal galactose from complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins.
* β-&quot;N&quot;-Acetylglucosaminidase (from Streptococcus pneumoniae): cleaves all non-reducing terminal β-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues from complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins.
* &quot;endo&quot;-α-&quot;N&quot;-Acetylgalactosaminidase (&quot;O&quot;-glycosidase from &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;): removes &quot;O&quot;-glycosylation. This enzyme cleaves serine- or threonine-linked unsubstituted Galβ1,3GalNAc
* PNGase F: cleaves asparagine-linked oligosaccharides unless α1,3-core fucosylated.

== Regulation of Notch signalling ==
Notch signalling is a cell signalling pathway whose role is, among many others, to control the cell differentiation process in equivalent precursor cells. This means it is crucial in embryonic development, to the point that it has been tested on mice that the removal of glycans in Notch proteins can result in embryonic death or malformations of vital organs like the heart.

Some of the specific modulators that control this process are glycosyltransferases located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The Notch proteins go through these organelles in their maturation process and can be subject to different types of glycosylation: N-linked glycosylation and O-linked glycosylation (more specifically: O-linked glucose and O-linked fucose).

All of the Notch proteins are modified by an O-fucose, because they share a common trait: O-fucosylation consensus sequences. One of the modulators that intervene in this process is the Fringe, a glycosyltransferase that modifies the O-fucose to activate or deactivate parts of the signalling, acting as a positive or negative regulator, respectively.

==Clinical==

There are three types of glycosylation disorders sorted by the type of alterations that are made to the glycosylation process: congenital alterations, acquired alterations and non-enzymatic acquired alterations.

* Congenital alterations: Over 40 congenital disorders of glycosylation (CGDs) have been reported in humans. These can be divided into four groups: disorders of protein &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation, disorders of protein &quot;O&quot;-glycosylation, disorders of lipid glycosylation and disorders of other glycosylation pathways and of multiple glycosylation pathways. No effective treatment is known for any of these disorders. 80% of these affect the nervous system.
* Acquired alterations: In this second group the main disorders are infectious diseases, autoimmune illnesses or cancer. In these cases, the changes in glycosylation are the cause of certain biological events. For example, in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), the body of the patient produces antibodies against the enzyme lymphocytes galactosyltransferase which inhibits the glycosylation of IgG. Therefore, the changes in the N-glycosylation produce the immunodeficiency involved in this illness. In this second group we can also find disorders caused by mutations on the enzymes that control the glycosylation of Notch proteins, such as Alagille syndrome.
* Non-enzymatic acquired alterations: Non-enzymatic disorders, are also acquired, but they are due to the lack of enzymes that attach oligosaccharides to the protein. In this group the illnesses that stand out are Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and diabetes.

All these diseases are difficult to diagnose because they do not only affect one organ, they affect many of them and in different ways. As a consequence, they are also hard to treat. However, thanks to the many advances that have been made in next-generation sequencing, scientists can now understand better these disorders and have discovered new CDGs.
=== Effects on therapeutic efficacy ===
It has been reported that mammalian glycosylation can improve the therapeutic efficacy of biotherapeutics. For example, therapeutic efficacy of recombinant human interferon gamma, expressed in HEK 293 platform, was improved against drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.

<text>Shallum of Israel ( &quot;Šallūm&quot;, &quot;retribution&quot;, &quot;fl.&quot; mid-8th century BC), was the fifteenth king of the ancient Kingdom of Israel, and the son of Jabesh, who reigned for only one month in 752 BCE.

== In the Bible ==

Originally a captain in the army of King Zechariah, Shallum &quot;conspired against Zechariah, and smote him before the people; and slew him, and reigned in his stead&quot; (). He reigned only &quot;a month of days in Samaria&quot; () before Menahem—another captain from Zechariah&#x27;s army—rose up and put Shallum to death (). Menahem then became king in Shallum&#x27;s stead.

In the Books of Kings (2 Kings, Chapter 15, verses 10, 13-14) Shallum&#x27;s father is identified as Jabesh. However, the passage may instead mention a toponym, identifying that Shallum was &quot;the son&quot; of a city called Jabesh. In this view, Shallum may have originated from Jabesh-Gilead. The city is mentioned several times in the Biblical texts. In the Book of Judges (Chapter 21), the male inhabitants of the city are murdered and their virgin girls are given as brides to the men of the Tribe of Benjamin.

In the Books of Samuel, Jabesh-Gilead is under siege by Nahash of Ammon and his army. The siege is lifted when Saul leads an Israelite army to rescue the city. The victory allows Saul to be recognized as the legitimate King of Israel, as his claim to the throne was previously rejected. When Saul died, his corpse was taken by the Philistines and hung from the city walls of Beth-shan. The men of Jabesh-Gilead eventually managed to retrieve the corpses of Saul and his sons. The city cremated the corpses and buried their bones.

== In &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; ==
Shallum is also depicted in the Greek-language history &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; by Josephus, under the Hellenized names of and . Josephus primarily uses the inflected form of the name: &quot;Sellëmos&quot; (). The name of Jabesh, Shallum&#x27;s father, is Hellenized to &quot;Jabësos&quot;.

Contradicting the Bible, Josephus depicts Shallum as a friend of his predecessor Zechariah of Israel. Josephus intentionally heightens the pathos (suffering) of Zechariah&#x27;s assassination, by depicting him betrayed and killed by a friend. Josephus similarly depicts Jehoash of Judah and Amaziah of Judah as victims of assassination by their respective friends.

The location of the assassination is left unclear in the Biblical texts, with various Greek versions identifying it as the city of Ibleam or Keblaam ( or . Josephus simply mentions no location for the event.

In Josephus&#x27; narrative, Shallum murders Zechariah, seizes power over Israel, and reigns for thirty days. In this position, the Biblical sources speak of a fulfilled prophecy, that the House of Jehu (represented by Zechariah) would only reign for four generations. Josephus omits any reference to this supposed prophecy. Josephus similarly omits Biblical information that Shallum&#x27;s seat of power was the city of Samaria, and that Shallum rose to the throne during the 39th regnal year of Uzziah, monarch of the Kingdom of Judah. Josephus has a tendency to abridge the narratives concerning the final few monarchs of Israel, with full-length narratives reserved only for Menahem and Hoshea.

Josephus&#x27; narrative next introduces Menahem under the Hellenized name Manaëmos (. He is identified with the Greek title of strategos, translating to general officer. In Josephus&#x27; narrative, Menahem is depicted as a general whose seat of power was the city of &quot;Tharsë&quot; (, identified with the city of Tirzah.

In the narrative, Menahem hears news that Zechariah has been assassinated, and then brings his entire army to Samaria to face Shallum. Josephus thus gives both a more detailed and a more plausible account of the event than the Biblical texts, where Menahem is seemingly acting alone.

== History ==
William F. Albright has dated his reign to 745 BC, while Hooker says 747. E.R. Thiele offers the date 752 BC.

<doc id="474370" wikidata="Q650063" url="?curid=474370" title="The Seagull">
<text>The Seagull () is a play by Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, written in 1895 and first produced in 1896. &quot;The Seagull&quot; is generally considered to be the first of his four major plays. It dramatizes the romantic and artistic conflicts between four characters: the famous middlebrow story writer Boris Trigorin, the ingenue Nina, the fading actress Irina Arkadina, and her son the symbolist playwright Konstantin Treplev.

Like Chekhov&#x27;s other full-length plays, &quot;The Seagull&quot; relies upon an ensemble cast of diverse, fully-developed characters. In contrast to the melodrama of mainstream 19th-century theatre, lurid actions (such as Konstantin&#x27;s suicide attempts) are not shown onstage. Characters tend to speak in subtext rather than directly. The character Trigorin is considered one of Chekhov&#x27;s greatest male roles. 

The opening night of the first production was a famous failure. Vera Komissarzhevskaya, playing Nina, was so intimidated by the hostility of the audience that she lost her voice. Chekhov left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes. When supporters wrote to him that the production later became a success, he assumed that they were merely trying to be kind. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the seminal Russian theatre practitioner of the time, directed it in 1898 for his Moscow Art Theatre, the play was a triumph. Stanislavski&#x27;s production became &quot;one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama&quot;.

Stanislavski&#x27;s direction caused &quot;The Seagull&quot; to be perceived as a tragedy through overzealousness with the concept of subtext, whereas Chekhov intended it to be a comedy.

== Writing ==

Chekhov purchased the Melikhovo farm in 1892 and ordered a lodge built in the middle of a cherry orchard. The lodge had three rooms, one containing a bed and another a writing table. Chekhov eventually moved in, and in a letter written in October 1895 he wrote:
I am writing a play which I shall probably not finish before the end of November. I am writing it not without pleasure, though I swear fearfully at the conventions of the stage. It&#x27;s a comedy, there are three women&#x27;s parts, six men&#x27;s, four acts, landscapes (view over a lake); a great deal of conversation about literature, little action, and tons of love.
Thus he acknowledged a departure from traditional dramatic action. This departure became a hallmark of Chekhovian theater. Chekhov&#x27;s statement also reflects his view of the play as a comedy, a view he maintained towards all his plays. After the play&#x27;s disastrous opening night, his friend Aleksey Suvorin chided him for being &quot;womanish&quot; and accused him of being in &quot;a funk.&quot; Chekhov vigorously denied this, stating:
Why this libel? After the performance, I had supper at Romanov&#x27;s. On my word of honor. Then I went to bed, slept soundly, and the next day, went home without uttering a sound of complaint. If I had been in a funk I should have run from editor to editor and actor to actor, should have nervously entreated them to be considerate, should nervously have inserted useless corrections, and should have spent two or three weeks in Petersburg fussing over my &quot;Seagull,&quot; in excitement, in a cold perspiration, in lamentation... I acted as coldly and reasonably as a man who has made an offer, received a refusal, and has nothing left but to go. Yes, my vanity was stung, but you know it was not a bolt from the blue; I was expecting a failure and was prepared for it, as I warned you with perfect sincerity beforehand.
And a month later:
I thought that if I had written and put on the stage a play so obviously brimming over with monstrous defects, I had lost all instinct and that, therefore, my machinery must have gone wrong for good.
The eventual success of the play, both in the remainder of its first run and in the subsequent staging by the Moscow Art Theatre under Stanislavski, encouraged Chekhov to remain a playwright and led to the overwhelming success of his next endeavor, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, and indeed to the rest of his dramatic work.

== Plot ==

=== Act I ===
Pyotr Sorin is a retired senior civil servant in failing health at his country estate. His sister, actress Irina Arkadina, arrives at the estate for a brief vacation with her lover, the writer Boris Trigorin. Pyotr and his guests gather at an outdoor stage to see an unconventional play that Irina&#x27;s son, Konstantin Treplev, has written and directed. The play-within-a-play features Nina Zarechnaya, a young woman who lives on a neighboring estate, as the &quot;soul of the world&quot; in a time far in the future. The play is Konstantin&#x27;s latest attempt at creating a new theatrical form. It is a dense symbolist work. Irina laughs at the play, finding it ridiculous and incomprehensible; the performance ends prematurely after audience interruption and Konstantin storms off in humiliation. Irina does not seem concerned about her son, who has not found his way in the world. Although others ridicule Konstantin&#x27;s drama, the physician Yevgeny Dorn praises him.

Act I also sets up the play&#x27;s various romantic triangles. The schoolteacher Semyon Medvedenko loves Masha, the daughter of the estate&#x27;s steward Ilya Shamrayev and his wife Polina Andryevna. However, Masha is in love with Konstantin, who is in love with Nina, but Nina falls for Trigorin. Polina is in an affair with Yevgeny. When Masha tells Yevgeny about her longing for Konstantin, Yevgeny helplessly blames the lake for making everybody feel romantic.

=== Act II ===
A few days later, in the afternoon, characters are outside the estate. Arkadina, after reminiscing about happier times, engages in a heated argument with the house steward Shamrayev and decides to leave. Nina lingers behind after the group leaves, and Konstantin arrives to give her a gull that he has shot. Nina is confused and horrified at the gift. Konstantin sees Trigorin approaching and leaves in a jealous fit. 

Nina asks Trigorin to tell her about the writer&#x27;s life; he replies that it is not an easy one. Nina says that she knows the life of an actress is not easy either, but she wants more than anything to be one. Trigorin sees the gull that Konstantin has shot and muses on how he could use it as a subject for a short story: The plot for the short story: a young girl lives all her life on the shore of a lake. She loves the lake, like a gull, and she&#x27;s happy and free, like a gull. But a man arrives by chance, and when he sees her, he destroys her, out of sheer boredom. Like this gull.Arkadina calls for Trigorin, and he leaves as she tells him that she has changed her mind – they will be leaving immediately. Nina lingers behind, enthralled with Trigorin&#x27;s celebrity and modesty, and gushes, &quot;My dream!&quot;

=== Act III ===
Inside the estate, Arkadina and Trigorin have decided to depart. Between acts, Konstantin attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head, but the bullet only grazed his skull. He spends the majority of Act III with his scalp heavily bandaged. 

Nina finds Trigorin eating breakfast and presents him with a medallion that proclaims her devotion to him, using a line from one of Trigorin&#x27;s own books: &quot;If you ever need my life, come and take it.&quot; She retreats after begging for one last chance to see Trigorin before he leaves. Arkadina appears, followed by Sorin, whose health has continued to deteriorate. Trigorin leaves to continue packing. After a brief argument between Arkadina and Sorin, Sorin collapses in grief. He is helped by Medvedenko. Konstantin enters and asks his mother to change his bandage. As she is doing this, Konstantin disparages Trigorin, eliciting another argument. When Trigorin reenters, Konstantin leaves in tears. 

Trigorin asks Arkadina if they can stay at the estate. She flatters and cajoles him until he agrees to return with her to Moscow. After she has left the room, Nina comes to say her final goodbye to Trigorin and to inform him that she is running away to become an actress against her parents&#x27; wishes. They kiss passionately and make plans to meet again in Moscow.

=== Act IV ===
It is winter two years later, in the drawing room that has been converted to Konstantin&#x27;s study. Masha finally accepts Medvedenko&#x27;s marriage proposal, and they have a child together, though Masha still nurses an unrequited love for Konstantin. Various characters discuss what has happened in the two years that have passed: Nina and Trigorin lived together in Moscow for a time until he abandoned her and went back to Arkadina. Nina gave birth to Trigorin&#x27;s baby, but it died in a short time. Nina never achieved any real success as an actress, and she is currently on a tour of the provinces with a small theatre group. Konstantin has had some short stories published, but he is increasingly depressed. Sorin&#x27;s health is still failing, and the people at the estate have telegraphed for Arkadina to come for his final days. 

Most of the play&#x27;s characters go to the drawing room to play a game of bingo. Konstantin does not join them, instead working on a manuscript at his desk. After the group leaves to eat dinner, Konstantin hears someone at the back door. He is surprised to find Nina, whom he invites inside. Nina tells Konstantin about her life over the last two years. Konstantin says that he followed Nina. She starts to compare herself to the gull that Konstantin killed in Act II, then rejects that and says &quot;I am an actress.&quot; She tells him that she was forced to tour with a second-rate theatre company after the death of the child she had with Trigorin, but she seems to have a newfound confidence. Konstantin pleads with her to stay, but she is in such disarray that his pleading means nothing. She embraces Konstantin and leaves. Despondent, Konstantin spends two minutes silently tearing up his manuscripts before leaving the study. 

The group reenters and returns to the bingo game. There is a sudden gunshot from off-stage, and Dorn goes to investigate. He returns and takes Trigorin aside. Dorn tells Trigorin to somehow get Arkadina away, for Konstantin has just shot himself.

== Performance history ==

=== Premiere in St. Petersburg ===
The first night of &quot;The Seagull&quot; on 17 October 1896 at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Petersburg was a disaster, booed by the audience. The hostile audience intimidated Vera Komissarzhevskaya so severely that she lost her voice. Some considered her the best actor in Russia who, according to Chekhov, had moved people to tears as Nina in rehearsal. The next day, Chekhov, who had taken refuge backstage for the last two acts, announced to Suvorin that he was finished with writing plays. When supporters assured him that later performances were more successful, Chekhov assumed they were just being kind. &quot;The Seagull&quot; impressed the playwright and friend of Chekhov Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, however, who said Chekhov should have won the Griboyedov prize that year for &quot;The Seagull&quot; instead of himself.

=== Moscow Art Theatre production ===

Nemirovich overcame Chekhov&#x27;s refusal to allow the play to appear in Moscow and convinced Stanislavski to direct the play for their innovative and newly founded Moscow Art Theatre in 1898. Stanislavski prepared a detailed directorial score, which indicated when the actors should &quot;wipe away dribble, blow their noses, smack their lips, wipe away sweat, or clean their teeth and nails with matchsticks&quot;, as well as organising a tight control of the overall &quot;mise en scène&quot;. This approach was intended to facilitate the unified expression of the inner action that Stanislavski perceived to be hidden beneath the surface of the play in its subtext. Stanislavski&#x27;s directorial score was published in 1938.

Stanislavski played Trigorin, while Vsevolod Meyerhold, the future director and practitioner (whom Stanislavski on his death-bed declared to be &quot;my sole heir in the theatre&quot;), played Konstantin, and Olga Knipper (Chekhov&#x27;s future wife) played Arkadina. The production opened on 17 December 1898 with a sense of crisis in the air in the theatre; most of the actors were mildly self-tranquilised with Valerian drops. In a letter to Chekhov, one audience member described how:

Nemirovich-Danchenko described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a dam breaking. The production received unanimous praise from the press.

It was not until 1 May 1899 that Chekhov saw the production, in a performance without sets but in make-up and costumes at the Paradiz Theatre. He praised the production but was less keen on Stanislavski&#x27;s own performance; he objected to the &quot;soft, weak-willed tone&quot; in his interpretation (shared by Nemirovich) of Trigorin and entreated Nemirovich to &quot;put some spunk into him or something&quot;. He proposed that the play be published with Stanislavski&#x27;s score of the production&#x27;s &quot;mise en scène&quot;. Chekhov&#x27;s collaboration with Stanislavski proved crucial to the creative development of both men. Stanislavski&#x27;s attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the play and revived Chekhov&#x27;s interest in writing for the stage. Chekhov&#x27;s unwillingness to explain or expand on the script forced Stanislavski to dig beneath the surface of the text in ways that were new in theatre. The Moscow Art Theatre to this day bears the seagull as its emblem to commemorate the historic production that gave it its identity.

=== Other notable productions ===
*The play had its German premiere in April 1909 at the Hebbel-Theater, Berlin. The play was cordially received but the Berlin correspondent of &quot;The Era&quot; doubted that the work would last: &quot;It is in the heavy, gloomy style of most Russian writers, while the interest of the average audience is not lively enough in the heroine&#x27;s adventures to keep the piece any length of time in the bill&quot;.

*The first production in English was given at the Royalty Theatre, Glasgow on 2 November 1909 by the Glasgow Repertory Theatre company, with Mary Jerrold as Arkadina, Milton Rosmer as Konstantin, Hubert Harben as Shamrayev, Campbell Gullan as Trigorin and Laurence Hanray as Sorin.

*The first production in London was at the Little Theatre on 31 March 1912, with Gertrude Kingston as Arkadina.

*The play&#x27;s Broadway premiere was at the Bandbox Theatre on 20 May 1916, with Helen Westley as Arkadina.

*The French premiere, under the title , was staged by Georges Pitoëff at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris, in 1922. The cast included as Arkadina, Michel Simon as Sorin, Pitoëff as Trigorin and Ludmilla Pitoëff as Nina.

*A production directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky opened at the New Theatre, London, on 20 May 1936, with Edith Evans as Arkadina, John Gielgud as Trigorin, Frederick Lloyd as Sorin, George Devine as Shamrayev, Martita Hunt as Masha and Peggy Ashcroft as Nina. After lukewarm reviews of earlier productions the play was now hailed by British critics: &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;&quot;The Seagull&quot; is among the supreme masterpieces of the theatre&quot;, and &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that Chekhov would begin to rival Shakespeare as the West End&#x27;s greatest attraction.

*The Theatre Guild presented the play at the Shubert Theatre, New York, in March 1938. Lynn Fontanne played Arkadina, with Alfred Lunt (Trigorin), Sydney Greenstreet (Sorin), Margaret Webster (Masha) and, in her Broadway debut, Uta Hagen (Nina). As in Britain, the play now received respectful and enthusiastic notices: one reviewer called it &quot;great drama, tragic and luminous, with a light which shadows the petty playwrighting of today&#x27;s dramatists&quot;.

*The first of two productions by the National Theatre in London was in 1994, in an adaptation by Pam Gems, directed by John Caird, with Judi Dench (Arkadina), Norman Rodway (Sorin), Bill Nighy (Trigorin) and Edward Petherbridge (Dorn). A second production by the National Theatre, in 2006, had a cast headed by Juliet Stevenson in a production of Martin Crimp&#x27;s adaptation, directed by Katie Mitchell. 

*In 1998, a production by Daniela Thomas, assisted by Luiz Päetow, toured Brazil under the title &quot;Da Gaivota&quot;, with Fernanda Montenegro as Arkadina, Matheus Nachtergaele as Treplyov, and Fernanda Torres as Nina.

*The Joseph Papp Public Theater presented Chekhov&#x27;s play as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival summer season in Central Park from 25 July 2001 to 26 August 2001. The production, directed by Mike Nichols, starred Meryl Streep as Arkadina, Christopher Walken as Sorin, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Treplyov, John Goodman as Shamrayev, Marcia Gay Harden as Masha, Kevin Kline as Trigorin, Debra Monk as Polina, Stephen Spinella as Medvedenko, and Natalie Portman as Nina.

*In January 2007, the Royal Court Theatre staged a production of &quot;The Seagull&quot; with Kristin Scott Thomas as Arkadina, Mackenzie Crook as Treplyov and Carey Mulligan as Nina. It also featured Chiwetel Ejiofor and Art Malik. The production was directed by Ian Rickson.

*In 2007 a production by the Royal Shakespeare Company toured internationally before coming into residence at the West End&#x27;s New London Theatre until 12 January 2008. It starred Frances Barber as Arkadina, William Gaunt and Ian McKellen alternating as Sorin, Richard Goulding as Treplyov, Jonathan Hyde as Dorn, Monica Dolan as Masha, and Romola Garai as Nina.

*Also in 2020, the Auckland Theatre Company presented an on-line production during the COVID-19 lockdown, using the device of a Zoom meeting for the stage. It was adapted by Eli Kent and Eleanor Bishop, who also directed it, with rehearsals and performances carried out online. It was well received by critics around the world, with &quot;The Scotsman&quot; declaring it one of the &quot;best plays to watch online.&quot;

== Analysis and criticism ==

It has been remarked that the play was &quot;a spectacle of waste&quot; (such as at the beginning of the play when Medvedenko asks Masha why she always wears black, she answers &quot;Because I&#x27;m in mourning for my life.&quot;).

The play also has an intertextual relationship with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Arkadina and Treplyov quote lines from it before the play-within-a-play in the first act (and this device is itself used in &quot;Hamlet&quot;). There are many allusions to Shakespearean plot details as well. For instance, Treplyov seeks to win his mother back from the usurping older man Trigorin much as Hamlet tries to win Queen Gertrude back from his uncle Claudius.

== Translation ==
&quot;The Seagull&quot; was first translated into English for a performance at the Royalty Theatre, Glasgow, in November 1909. Since that time, there have been numerous translations of the text—between 1998 and 2004 alone there were 25 published versions. In the introduction to his own version, Tom Stoppard wrote: &quot;You can&#x27;t have too many English Seagulls: at the intersection of all of them, the Russian one will be forever elusive.&quot; In fact, the problems start with the title of the play: there&#x27;s no sea anywhere near the play&#x27;s settings, so the bird in question was in all likelihood a lake-dwelling gull such as the common gull (&quot;larus canus&quot;), rather than a nautical variant. In Russian both kinds of birds are named , simply meaning &quot;gull&quot;, as in English. However, the title persists as it is much more euphonious in English than the much shorter and blunter &quot;The Gull&quot;, which comes across as too forceful and direct to represent the encompassing vague and partially hidden feelings beneath the surface. Therefore, the faint reference to the sea has been seen as a more fitting representation of the intent of the play. 

Some early translations of &quot;The Seagull&quot; have come under criticism from modern Russian scholars. , in particular, has been criticized for its elementary mistakes and total ignorance of Russian life and culture. Peter France, translator and author of the book &quot;The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation&quot;, wrote of Chekhov&#x27;s multiple adaptations:

=== Notable English translations ===
== Adaptations ==
=== Theatre ===
The American playwright Tennessee Williams adapted the play as &quot;The Notebook of Trigorin&quot;, which premiered in 1981. That year, Thomas Kilroy&#x27;s adaptation, &quot;The Seagull&quot; also premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London. The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor wrote an adaptation called &quot;His Greatness&quot;.

In 2004, American playwright Regina Taylor&#x27;s African-American adaptation, &quot;Drowning Crow&quot;, was performed on Broadway.

Emily Mann wrote and directed an adaptation called &quot;A Seagull in the Hamptons&quot;. The play premiered at the McCarter Theatre May 2008.

Libby Appel did a new version that premiered in 2011 at the Marin Theatre in Mill Valley using newly discovered material from Chekhov&#x27;s original manuscripts. In pre-Revolutionary Russia, plays underwent censorship from two sources, the government censor and the directors. The removed passages were saved in the archives of Russia, and unavailable till the fall of the Iron Curtain.

In 2011, Benedict Andrews re-imagined the work as being set on a modern Australian beach in his production of the play at Sydney&#x27;s Belvoir Theatre, which starred Judy Davis, David Wenham and Maeve Darmody. He did this to explore the ideas of space and time.

In October 2011, it was announced that a contemporary Hamptons-set film adaptation, &quot;Relative Insanity&quot;, will be directed by the acting coach Larry Moss, starring David Duchovny, Helen Hunt, Maggie Grace and Joan Chen.

In 2013, a deconstruction of the play by Aaron Posner, set in the modern day under the title &quot;Stupid Fucking Bird&quot;, was premiered at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.; it won the 2014 Charles MacArthur Award for Outstanding New Play or Musical and has been staged widely across American theatres.

In 2014, Takarazuka Revues&#x27;s Star Troupe performed a musical version of the play, which was adapted and directed by Naoko Koyonagi. It starred Makoto Rei as Konstantin and Mirei Shiroki as Nina.

A 2022 gender-fluid adaptation of the Tom Stoppard version was completed by the Doris Place Players to great success in Los Angeles.

In 2022, Emilia Clarke starred in Anya Reiss&#x27; adaption in Harold Pinter Theatre in London. It was described as a unique 21st century modernisation.

Thomas Bradshaw wrote a modern-day adaptation set in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley entitled &quot;The Seagull/Woodstock, NY&quot;. The play was produced Off-Broadway by The New Group in 2023 and starred Parker Posey, Nat Wolff, Ato Essandoh, and Hari Nef.

A new version by Duncan Macmillan and Thomas Ostermeier, starring Emma Corrin as Nina and Cate Blanchett as Arkadina, is set to premiere at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre in February 2025. Directed by Ostermeier, the adaptation is also due to star Priyanga Burford, Tom Burke, Tanya Reynolds, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jason Watkins.

=== Film ===
Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; used Moura Budberg&#x27;s translation. The play was also adapted as the Russian film &quot;The Seagull&quot; in 1972.

The 2003 film &quot;La petite Lili&quot; by director Claude Miller, starring Ludivine Sagnier as Nina renamed Lili, updates Chekhov&#x27;s play to contemporary France in the world of the cinema.

Christian Camargo directed a 2014 film adaptation of the play, titled &quot;Days and Nights&quot;, set in rural New England during the 1980s. The film starred Camargo, William Hurt, Allison Janney, Katie Holmes, Mark Rylance, and Juliet Rylance.

An American film titled &quot;The Seagull&quot; went into production in 2015. It was released on May 11, 2018, by Sony Pictures Classics; directed by Michael Mayer with a screenplay by Stephen Karam, starring Annette Bening and Saoirse Ronan.

A contemporary Afrikaans-language film adaptation directed by Christiaan Olwagen, titled &quot;Die Seemeeu&quot;, debuted at the Kyknet Silwerskermfees on 23 August 2018. Cintaine Schutte won the Best Supporting Actress award for her portrayal of Masha.

=== Opera === 
The play was the basis for the 1974 opera &quot;The Seagull&quot; by Thomas Pasatieri to an English libretto by Kenward Elmslie.

=== Musical ===
The 1987 musical &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot; by Winnie Holzman and David Evans is a metatheatrical adaptation, both loosely following the original play and containing a musical version of the play as the Konstantin equivalent&#x27;s play.

In 2015, the play was adapted into &quot;Songbird&quot;, a country musical by Michael Kimmel and Lauren Pritchard. &quot;Songbird&quot; sets its story in Nashville and centers around Tammy Trip, a fading country star. Tammy returns to the honky tonk where she got her start to help her estranged son launch his own music career. The show was produced at 59E59 Theaters and featured Kate Baldwin and Erin Dilly. It was recognized as a New York Times Critic&#x27;s Pick.

=== Ballet ===
It was made into a ballet by John Neumeier with his Hamburg Ballet company in June 2002. This version re-imagined the main characters as coming from the world of dance. Arkadina became a famous prima ballerina, Nina was a young dancer on the brink of her career. Konstantin appeared as a revolutionary young choreographer and Trigorin as an older, more conventional choreographer.

An earlier ballet in two acts, by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin, was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1980.

<doc id="474372" wikidata="Q4688061" url="?curid=474372" title="Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis">
<text>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, abbreviated as 2-DE or 2-D electrophoresis, is a form of gel electrophoresis commonly used to analyze proteins. Mixtures of proteins are separated by two properties in two dimensions on 2D gels. 2-DE was first independently introduced by O&#x27;Farrell and Klose in 1975.

== Basis for separation ==
2-D electrophoresis begins with electrophoresis in the first dimension and then separates the molecules perpendicularly from the first to create an electropherogram in the second dimension. In electrophoresis in the first dimension, molecules are separated linearly according to their isoelectric point. In the second dimension, the molecules are then separated at 90 degrees from the first electropherogram according to molecular mass. Since it is unlikely that two molecules will be similar in two distinct properties, molecules are more effectively separated in 2-D electrophoresis than in 1-D electrophoresis.

The two dimensions that proteins are separated into using this technique can be isoelectric point, protein complex mass in the native state, or protein mass.
* The separation by isoelectric point is called isoelectric focusing. Thereby, a pH gradient is applied to a gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel, making one end more positive than the other. At all pH values other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will be pulled towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will be pulled to the more positive end of the gel. The proteins applied in the first dimension will move along the gel and will accumulate at their isoelectric point; that is, the point at which the overall charge on the protein is 0 (a neutral charge).
* Separation by protein complex mass is done via native PAGE, in which proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie brilliant blue or lithium dodecyl sulfate. Knowledge of protein complex is important for the analysis of the functioning of proteins in a cell, as proteins mostly act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes.
* Separate just by mass is commonly achieved using SDS-PAGE. SDS denatures the proteins, breaks apart most complexes, and approximately equalizes the mass-to-charge ratios. SDS must be done as the second, perpendicular dimension, as it breaks apart complexes (rendering native PAGE impossible) and equalizes mass-to-charge ratios (rendering IEF impossible).

== Detecting proteins ==
The result of this is a gel with proteins spread out on its surface. These proteins can then be detected by a variety of means, but the most commonly used stains are silver and Coomassie brilliant blue staining. In the former case, a silver colloid is applied to the gel. The silver binds to cysteine groups within the protein. The silver is darkened by exposure to ultra-violet light. The amount of silver can be related to the darkness, and therefore the amount of protein at a given location on the gel. This measurement can only give approximate amounts, but is adequate for most purposes. Silver staining is 100x more sensitive than Coomassie brilliant blue with a 40-fold range of linearity.

Molecules other than proteins can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In supercoiling assays, coiled DNA is separated in the first dimension and denatured by a DNA intercalator (such as ethidium bromide or the less carcinogenic chloroquine) in the second. This is comparable to the combination of native PAGE/SDS-PAGE in protein separation.

== Common techniques ==

=== IPG-DALT ===
A common technique is to use an Immobilized pH gradient (IPG) in the first dimension. This technique is referred to as IPG-DALT. The sample is first separated onto IPG gel (which is commercially available) then the gel is cut into slices for each sample which is then equilibrated in SDS-mercaptoethanol and applied to an SDS-PAGE gel for resolution in the second dimension. Typically IPG-DALT is not used for quantification of proteins due to the loss of low molecular weight components during the transfer to the SDS-PAGE gel.

=== IEF SDS-PAGE ===
See Isoelectric focusing

== 2D gel analysis software ==

In quantitative proteomics, these tools primarily analyze bio-markers by quantifying individual proteins, and showing the separation between one or more protein &quot;spots&quot; on a scanned image of a 2-DE gel. Additionally, these tools match spots between gels of similar samples to show, for example, proteomic differences between early and advanced stages of an illness. While this technology is widely utilized, the intelligence has not been perfected. For example, some software may tend to agree on the quantification and analysis of well-defined well-separated protein spots, they deliver different results and analysis tendencies with less-defined less-separated spots. Comparative studies have previously been published to guide researchers on the &quot;best&quot; software for their analysis.

Challenges for automatic software-based analysis include incompletely separated (overlapping) spots (less-defined or separated), weak spots / noise (e.g., &quot;ghost spots&quot;), running differences between gels (e.g., protein migrates to different positions on different gels), unmatched/undetected spots, leading to missing values, mismatched spots, errors in quantification (several distinct spots may be erroneously detected as a single spot by the software and parts of a spot may be excluded from quantification), and differences in software algorithms and therefore analysis tendencies

Generated picking lists can be used for the automated in-gel digestion of protein spots, and subsequent identification of the proteins by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis can identify precise mass measurements along with the sequencing of peptides that range from 1000–4000 atomic mass units.

<doc id="474375" wikidata="Q529612" url="?curid=474375" title="Honoré Beaugrand">
<text>Honoré Beaugrand (24 March 1848 – 7 October 1906) was a French Canadian journalist, politician, author and folklorist, born in Berthier County, Quebec.

As a young graduate from military school Beaugrand joined the French military forces under General Bazaine in Mexico, supporting the ill-fated emperor Maximilian of Mexico. He returned with those troops to France after the fall of Chapultepec and Maximilian&#x27;s execution. After some months he moved to New Orleans in 1868 and became a journalist. Subsequently, he wrote for U.S. newspapers in St. Louis, Boston, Chicago, and Lowell and Fall River, Massachusetts.

In 1878, he returned to Canada and founded the newspaper &quot;La Patrie&quot; in Montreal to take the place of &quot;Le National&quot; which had recently folded. It ceased publication in 1957, after 78 years. In August 1879 he acquired &quot;Le Canard&quot; from publisher and satirist Hector Berthelot. He made a name as a political writer and reporter, and in 1885 received the cross of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur.

He became a freemason in 1873 and took part in the foundation of Montreal Émancipation lodge in 1897.

He was elected mayor of Montreal in 1885. Today, a street in Montreal and the Honoré-Beaugrand station on the green line of the Montreal metro are named in his honour. He is most famous in Quebec for writing down the legend of the &quot;Chasse-galerie&quot;, published in 1891 in &quot;La chasse galerie: légendes canadiennes&quot;, which also included &quot;Le loup-garou,&quot; &quot;La bête à grand&#x27;queue,&quot; &quot;Macloune,&quot; and &quot;Le père Louison.&quot; He also published English-language version of &quot;Le loup-garou&quot; (&quot;The Werwolves&quot;) in a 1898 edition of The Century, under the name Henry Beaugrand.

<doc id="474379" wikidata="Q455676" url="?curid=474379" title="Ioannis Grivas">
<text>Ioannis Grivas (; 23 February 1923 – 27 November 2016) was a Greek judge, who served as President of the Court of Cassation and served as the Prime Minister of Greece at the head of a non-party caretaker government in 1989.

== Life ==
Grivas was born in Kato Tithorea, Amfikleia-Elateia, Phthiotis. He studied law at the University of Athens and in 1954 he became a judge. He took part as a judge in the Greek Junta Trials in 1975, and in 1979, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Greece for Civil and Criminal Cases. He became vice-president of the court in 1986 and president in 1989–90.

In 1989, Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s government was rocked by the deterioration of the Greek economy and a series of corruption scandals, including Koskotas scandal. Papandreou changed the electoral law to prevent the opposition party from gaining a majority, leading to the Greek Parliament being deadlocked following the 18 June 1989 elections. A coalition between conservatives and communists, with a limited mandate, formed a government under Tzannis Tzannetakis to investigate the corruption in Papandreou&#x27;s government. After the indictment of Papandreou and several of his ministers, the coalition was resolved. The Constitution required the president of one of Greece&#x27;s Supreme Courts to be appointed interim Prime Minister. Grivas agreed to head a caretaker government to preside over fresh elections.

He took office on 12 October 1989 to lead the country to new elections, held on 5 November. After the elections produced another deadlocked Parliament, he resigned on 23 November 1989 in favor of Xenophon Zolotas, who formed a National Unity government in which all three parliamentary parties participated. In domestic policy, maternity leave was extended to 15 weeks.

Grivas retired in 1990. He died on 27 November 2016, aged 93.

<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles in the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales, and airplay. In 2003, there were 11 singles that topped the chart.

During the year, ten acts achieved a first U.S. number-one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest. Those acts were B2K, LL Cool J, 50 Cent, Sean Paul, Nate Dogg, Clay Aiken, Murphy Lee, Ludacris, and Shawnna. Beyoncé, despite having hit number one with Destiny&#x27;s Child, also earns her first number one song as a solo act. P. Diddy, 50 Cent, Sean Paul, and Beyoncé were the only acts to hit number one more than once, each of them reaching number one twice throughout the year.

50 Cent and Knowles both had the longest-running singles of 2003: 50 Cent&#x27;s first number-one single &quot;In da Club&quot; and Knowles&#x27; second number-one single &quot;Baby Boy&quot; both topped the Hot 100 for nine straight weeks, longer than any single to have topped this year. Hip hop duo OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; charted at the top spot for nine consecutive weeks, three of which were in 2003. Although &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; continued its pole position until early 2004, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine credited it as one of the longest-running number-one singles of 2003. Rapper Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; continued its 12-week chart run at the top spot in this year, but is credited as the longest-running number-one single of 2002. Knowles had the most weeks on top with 17, combining the chart run of both &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;. She surpassed the record previously set by 50 Cent during this year, the latter of whom gained a total of 13 weeks at number one combining &quot;In the Club&quot;, which is the best-performing single of 2003, and &quot;21 Questions&quot;.

With the combined chart run of &quot;Get Busy&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, the latter in which he is featured, dancehall artist Sean Paul became the most successful Jamaican-born artist in terms of chart performance in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Seven collaboration singles topped the chart in 2003, setting a record for most number-one collaborations in a calendar year since the onset of the rock era in 1955; the first number-one collaboration to have topped the chart was in 1967 with Somethin&#x27; Stupid, a song by singer Frank Sinatra and daughter Nancy Sinatra. The record was later tied in 2004, and broken in 2006 with eight number-one collaborations. &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Clay Aiken&#x27;s debut single &quot;This Is the Night&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the first single to do so since 1998. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, which charted for eight straight weeks in July to August, has been credited as 2003&#x27;s Song of the Summer.

<doc id="474388" wikidata="Q242310" url="?curid=474388" title="Bacteriorhodopsin">
<text>Bacteriorhodopsin (Bop) is a protein used by Archaea, most notably by haloarchaea, a class of the Euryarchaeota. It acts as a proton pump; that is, it captures light energy and uses it to move protons across the membrane out of the cell. The resulting proton gradient is subsequently converted into chemical energy.

==Function==

Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven H+ ion transporter found in some haloarchaea, most notably &quot;Halobacterium salinarum&quot; (formerly known as syn. &quot;H. halobium&quot;). The proton-motive force generated by the protein is used by ATP synthase to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). By expressing bacteriorhodopsin, the archaea cells are able to synthesise ATP in the absence of a carbon source.

== Structure ==
Bacteriorhodopsin is a 27&quot; &quot;kDa integral membrane protein usually found in two-dimensional crystalline patches known as &quot;purple membrane&quot;, which can occupy almost 50% of the surface area of the archaeal cell. The repeating element of the hexagonal lattice is composed of three identical protein chains, each rotated by 120 degrees relative to the others. Each monomer has seven transmembrane alpha helices and an extracellular-facing, two-stranded beta sheet.

Bacteriorhodopsin is synthesized as a protein precursor, known as bacterio-opsin, which is extensively modified after translation. The modifications are:
* Covalent conjugation of a retinal molecule to residue Lys216, via a Schiff base, to create the retinylidene chromophore.
* Cleavage of the signal peptide, the first 13 amino acids at the N-terminus, and the conversion of residue Gln14 to pyroglutamate
* Removal of residue Asp262 at the C-terminus

==Spectral properties==
Bacteriorhodopsin molecule is purple and is most efficient at absorbing green light (in the wavelength range 500-650 nm). In the native membrane, the protein has a maximum absorbance at 553 nm, however addition of detergent disrupts the trimeric form, leading a loss of exciton coupling between the chromophores, and the monomeric form consequently has an absorption maximum of 568 nm.

Bacteriorhodopsin has a broad excitation spectrum. For a detection wavelength between 700 and 800 nm, it has an appreciable detected emission for excitation wavelengths between 470 nm and 650 nm (with a peak at 570 nm).
When pumped at 633 nm, the emission spectrum has appreciable intensity between 650 nm and 850 nm.

== Mechanism ==
=== Photocycle overview===
Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump. It is the retinal molecule that changes its isomerization state from all-&quot;trans&quot; to 13-&quot;cis&quot; when it absorbs a photon. The surrounding protein responds to the change in the chromophore shape, by undergoing an ordered sequence of conformational changes (collectively known as the photocycle). The conformational changes alter the p&quot;K&quot;a values of conserved amino acids in the core of the protein, including Asp85, Asp96 and the Schiff base N atom (Lys216). These sequential changes in acid dissociation constant, result in the transfer of one proton from the intracellular side to the extracellular side of the membrane for each photon absorbed by the chromophore.

The bacteriorhodopsin photocycle consists of nine distinct stages, starting from the ground or resting state, which is denoted &#x27;bR&#x27;. The intermediates are identified by single letters and may be distinguished by their absorption spectra. The nine stages are:
: bR + photon → K L M1 M2 M2&#x27; N N&#x27; O bR

===Ground state + photon → K state → L state===

Bacteriorhodopsin in the ground state absorbs a photon and the retinal changes isomerization from all-&quot;trans&quot; 15-&quot;anti&quot; to the strained 13-&quot;cis&quot; 15-&quot;anti&quot; in the K state. The isomerisation reaction is fast and occurs in less than 1 ps. The retinal adopts a less strained conformation to form the L intermediate. 

===L state → M1 state===
Asp85 accepts a proton from the Schiff base N atom. In the M1 intermediate, neither the Schiff base nor Asp85 are charged.

===M1 state → M2 state===
The Schiff base rotates away from the extracellular side of the protein towards the cytoplasmic side, in preparation to accept a new proton.

===M2 state → M2&#x27; state===
A proton is released from Glu204 and Glu194 to the extracellular medium.

===M2&#x27; state → N state===
The retinal Schiff base accepts a proton from Asp96. In the N state, both Asp96 and the Schiff base are charged.

===N state → N&#x27; state===
Asp96 accepts a proton from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and becomes uncharged.

===N&#x27; state → O state===
Retinal reisomerizes to the all-&quot;trans&quot; state.

===O state → ground state===
Asp85 transfers a proton to Glu194 and Glu204 on the extracellular face of the protein.

==Homologs and other similar proteins==
Bacteriorhodopsin belongs to the microbial rhodopsin family. Its homologs include the archaerhodopsins, the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin (for which the crystal structure is also known), and some directly light-activated channels such as channelrhodopsin.

Bacteriorhodopsin is similar to vertebrate rhodopsins, the pigments that sense light in the retina. Rhodopsins also contain retinal; however, the functions of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin are different, and there is limited similarity in their amino acid sequences. Both rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin belong to the 7TM receptor family of proteins, but rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled receptor and bacteriorhodopsin is not. In the first use of electron crystallography to obtain an atomic-level protein structure, the structure of bacteriorhodopsin was resolved in 1990. It was then used as a template to build models of G protein-coupled receptors before crystallographic structures were also available for these proteins. It has been excessively studied on both mica and glass substrates using Atomic force microscopy and Femtosecond crystallography.

All other phototrophic systems in bacteria, algae, and plants use chlorophylls or bacteriochlorophylls rather than bacteriorhodopsin. These also produce a proton gradient, but in a quite different and more indirect way involving an electron transfer chain consisting of several other proteins. Furthermore, chlorophylls are aided in capturing light energy by other pigments known as &quot;antennas&quot;; these are not present in bacteriorhodopsin-based systems. It is possible that phototrophy independently evolved at least twice, once in bacteria and once in archaea.

<text>The Oregon boundary dispute or the Oregon Question was a 19th-century territorial dispute over the political division of the Pacific Northwest of North America between several nations that had competing territorial and commercial aspirations in the region.

Expansionist competition into the region began in the 18th century, with participants including the Russian Empire, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. After the War of 1812, the Oregon dispute took on increased importance for diplomatic relations between the British Empire and the fledgling American republic. In the mid-1820s, the Russians signed the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825, and the Spanish signed the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, by which Russia and Spain formally withdrew their respective territorial claims in the region, and the British and the Americans acquired residual territorial rights in the disputed area. But the question of sovereignty over a portion of the North American Pacific coast was still contested between the United Kingdom and the United States. The disputed area was defined as the region west of the Continental Divide of the Americas, north of Mexico&#x27;s Alta California border of 42nd parallel north, and south of Russian America at parallel 54°40′ north. The British generally called this region the Columbia District and the Americans generally called it Oregon Country.

During the 1844 United States presidential election campaign, the Democratic Party proposed ending the Oregon Question by annexing the entire area. The U.S. Whig Party, in contrast, evinced no interest in the question – due, some scholars have claimed, to the Whig view that it was unimportant compared to other domestic problems. The Democratic candidate, James K. Polk, invoked the popular theme of manifest destiny and appealed to voters&#x27; expansionist sentiments in pressing for annexation, and defeated the Whig candidate, Henry Clay. Polk then sent the British government an offer to agree on a partition along the 49th parallel (which had been previously offered). 

However, the resulting negotiations soon faltered: the British still pressed for a border along the Columbia River. Tensions grew as American expansionists, such as Senator Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana and Representative Leonard Henly Sims of Missouri, urged Polk to annex the entire Pacific Northwest all the way to the 54°40′ parallel north (which is what the Democrats had called for during the presidential campaign). These tensions gave rise to slogans such as &quot;Fifty-four Forty or Fight!&quot; At the same time, U.S. relations with the Centralist Republic of Mexico were rapidly deteriorating as a result of the recent U.S. annexation of Texas. This gave rise to a concern that the U.S. might have to fight two wars on two fronts at the same time. Thus, just before the outbreak of the Mexican–American War, Polk retreated to his earlier position, calling for the Oregon border to run along the 49th parallel.

The 1846 Oregon Treaty established the border between British North America and the United States along the 49th parallel until the Strait of Georgia, where the marine boundary curved south to exclude Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands from the United States. As a result, a small portion of the Tsawwassen Peninsula, Point Roberts, became an exclave of the United States. Vague wording in the treaty left the ownership of the San Juan Islands in doubt, as the division was to follow &quot;through the middle of the said channel&quot; to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. During the so-called Pig War, both nations agreed to a joint military occupation of the islands. Kaiser Wilhelm I of the German Empire was selected as an arbitrator to end the dispute, with a three-man commission ruling in favor of the United States in 1872. There the Haro Strait became the borderline, rather than the British-favored Rosario Strait. The border established by the Oregon Treaty and finalized by the arbitration in 1872 remains the boundary between the United States and Canada in the Pacific Northwest.

==Background==
The Oregon Question originated in the 18th century during the early European or American exploration of the Pacific Northwest. Various empires began to consider the area suitable for colonial expansion, including the Americans, Russians, Spanish and British. Naval captains such as the Spanish Juan José Pérez Hernández, British George Vancouver and American Robert Gray gave defining regional water formations like the Columbia River and the Puget Sound their modern names and charted them in the 1790s. Overland explorations were commenced by the British Alexander Mackenzie in 1792 and later followed by the American Lewis and Clark expedition, which reached the mouth of the Columbia River in 1805. These explorers often claimed in the name of their respective governments sovereignty over the Northwest Coast. The knowledge of fur-bearing animal populations like the California sea lion, North American beaver and the Northern fur seal were used to create an economic network called the maritime fur trade. The fur trade would remain the main economic interest that drew Euro-Americans to the Pacific Northwest for decades. Merchants exchanged goods for fur pelts along the coast with indigenous nations such as the Chinookan people, the Aleuts and the Nuu-chah-nulth.

===Spanish colonization===
A series of expeditions to the Pacific Northwest were financed by the Spanish to strengthen their claims to the region. Creating a colony called Santa Cruz de Nuca on Vancouver Island, the Spanish were the first European colonisers of the Pacific Northwest outside Russian America to the north. A period of tensions with the United Kingdom, called the Nootka Crisis, arose after the Spanish seized a British vessel. However the three Nootka Conventions averted conflict, with both countries agreeing to protect their mutual access to Friendly Cove against outside powers. While the Spanish colony was abandoned, a border delineating the northern reaches of New Spain was not included. Despite the Nootka Conventions still allowing the Spanish to establish colonies in the region, no more attempts were made as other geopolitical and domestic matters drew the attention of the authorities. With the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, the Spanish formally withdrew all formal claims to lands north of the 42° north.

===Russian interest===
The Imperial Russian government established the Russian-American Company in 1799, a monopoly among Russian subjects for fur trading operations in Russian America with the Ukase of 1799. In part from the growing Russian activities to the north, the Spanish created the Catholic Missions to create colonies in Alta California. Plans for creating Russian colonies in what became the modern American states of Washington and Oregon were formulated by Nikolai Rezanov. He aimed to relocate the primary colony of Russian America to the entrance of the Columbia River, but was unable to enter the river in 1806 and the plan was abandoned. 

In 1808 Alexander Andreyevich Baranov sent the &quot;Nikolai&quot;, with the captain &quot;ordered to explore the coast south of Vancouver Island, barter with the natives for sea otter pelts, and if possible discover a site for a permanent Russian post in the Oregon Country.&quot; The ship wrecked on the Olympic Peninsula and the surviving crew did not return to New Archangel for two years. The failure of the vessel to find a suitable location led to the Russians to not consider much of the Northwest coast worth colonizing. Their interest in the Puget Sound and the Columbia River was diverted to Alta California, with Fort Ross soon established. 

The Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the 1825 Treaty of Saint Petersburg with the British formally created the southern border of Russian America at parallel 54°40′ north. Specifically, it was agreed, in the 1824 treaty, that no American settlement would be established on the coast or adjacent island north of 54°40′, and no Russian settlement to the south (Russian Fort Ross was in Alta California, Mexico, and was outside the purview of the treaty). The treaty did not make any explicit statements about sovereignty or territorial claims. The 1825 treaty with Britain was more strongly worded and defined the boundary between Russian and British possessions in North America, which ran north from 54°40′ through what is now the Alaska Panhandle to the 141st meridian west, then along that line north to the Arctic Ocean.

===Early Anglo-American competition===
Neither the Russian nor Spanish empires held significant plans at promoting colonies along the Northwest Coast by the 1810s. The British and the Americans were the remaining two nations with citizens active in commercial operations in the region. Starting with a party of the Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) employees led by David Thompson in 1807, the British began land-based operations and opened trading posts throughout the region. Thompson extensively explored the Columbia River watershed. While at the junction of Columbia and Snake Rivers, he erected a pole on July 9, 1811, with a notice stating &quot;Know hereby that this country is claimed by Great Britain as part of its territories ...&quot; and additionally stated the intention of the NWC to build a trading post there. Fort Nez Percés was later established at the location in 1818. The American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) began operations in 1811 at Fort Astoria, constructed at the entrance of the Columbia River. The eruption of the War of 1812 did not lead to a violent confrontation in the Pacific Northwest between the competing companies. Led by Donald Mackenzie, PFC officers agreed to liquidate its assets to their NWC competitors, with an agreement signed on 23 November 1813. was ordered to capture Fort Astoria, though by the time it arrived, the post was already under NWC management. After the collapse of the PFC, American mountain men operated in small groups in the region, typically based east of the Rocky Mountains, only to meet once a year at the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous.

==Joint occupation==

===Treaty of 1818===

In 1818, diplomats of the two countries attempted to negotiate a boundary between the rival claims. The Americans suggested dividing the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel, which was the border between the United States and British North America east of the Rocky Mountains. The lack of accurate cartographic knowledge led American diplomats to declare the Louisiana Purchase gave them an incontestable claim to the region. British diplomats wanted a border further south along the Columbia River, so as to maintain the North West Company&#x27;s (later the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s (HBC)) control of the lucrative fur trade along that river. The diplomatic teams could not agree upon mutually satisfactory terms and remained in deadlock by October. Albert Gallatin, the main American negotiator, had previously instructed to have a tentative agreement by the convening of the third session of the 15th United States Congress, set for 16 November.

A final proposition was made to the British plenipotentiary, Frederick John Robinson, for the continuation of the 49th parallel west while leaving the United Kingdom, as Gallatin stated, &quot;all the waters emptying in the sound called the Gulf of Georgia.&quot; This would have awarded &quot;all the territory draining west from the Cascade divide and north from the Columbia River divide into the gulf&quot; and the entirety of the Puget Sound along with the Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca to the United Kingdom. Robinson demurred from the proposal. However, the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which settled most other disputes from the War of 1812, called for the joint occupation of the region for ten years.

===Proposed partition plans===
As the expiration of the Joint Occupation treaty approached, a second round of negotiations commenced in 1824. American Minister Richard Rush offered for the extension of agreement with an additional clause on 2 April. The 51° parallel would be a provisional border within the Pacific Northwest, with no British additional settlements to be established south of the line, nor any American settlements north of it. Despite Rush&#x27;s offering to modify the temporary border to the 49° parallel, the British negotiators rejected his offer. His proposal was seen as the likely basis for the eventual division of the Pacific Northwest. The British plenipotentiaries William Huskisson and Stratford Canning on 29 June pressed instead for a permanent line along the 49° parallel west until the main branch of the Columbia River. With the British formally abandoning claims south or east of the Columbia River, the Oregon Question thence became focused on what later became Western Washington and the southern portion of Vancouver Island. Rush reacted to the British proposal as unfavorably as they had to his own offer, leaving the talks at a stalemate.

Throughout 1825, George Canning, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, held discussions with Governor Pelly of the HBC as to a potential settlement with the United States. Pelly felt a border along the Snake and Columbia Rivers was advantageous for the United Kingdom and his company. Contacting American minister Rufus King in April 1826, Canning requested that a settlement be reached over the Oregon dispute. Gallatin was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom and given instructions by Secretary of State Henry Clay in July 1826 to offer a division of the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean to the British. In a letter to Prime Minister Lord Liverpool in 1826, Canning presented the possibilities of trade with the Qing Empire if a division of the Pacific Northwest was to be made with the Americans. He felt the recognition of American rights to ownership of Astoria, despite its continued use by the NWC and later HBC, was &quot;absolutely unjustifiable&quot;. This diplomatic courtesy Canning felt weakened the territorial claims of the United Kingdom. A border along the Columbia River would give &quot;an immense direct intercourse between China and what may be, if we resolve not yield them up, her boundless establishments on the N. W. Coast of America&quot;.

===Renewal===
Huskisson was appointed along with Henry Unwin Addington to negotiate with Gallatin. Unlike his superior, Canning, Huskisson held a negative view of the HBC monopoly and found the region held in dispute with the Americans &quot;of little consequence to the British&quot;. At the time the HBC&#x27;s staff were the only continuous white occupants in the region, though their economic activities were not utilized by Huskinisson in exchanges with Gallatin. The division suggested by Pelly and Canning&#x27;s 1824 offer of a Columbia River boundary was rejected. The argument used to counter these offers was the same as in 1824, that a boundary along the Columbia would deny the U.S. an easily accessible deep water port on the Pacific Ocean. The British negotiators to allay this attack offered a detached Olympic Peninsula as American territory, giving access to both the Straits of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. This was seen as unsatisfactory by the Americans however. The diplomatic talks were continued but failed to divide the region in a satisfactory manner for both nations. The Treaty of 1818 was renewed on 7 August 1827, with a clause added by Gallatin that a one-year notice had to be given when either party intended to abrogate the agreement. After the death of Canning and the failure to find a satisfactory division of the region with the Americans, &quot;Oregon had been almost forgotten by the [British] politicians&quot;.

==Significance in the United States==

===Regional activities===
American Protestant missionaries began to arrive in the 1830s and established the Methodist Mission in the Willamette Valley and the Whitman Mission east of the Cascades. Ewing Young created a saw mill and a grist mill in the Willamette Valley early in the 1830s. He and several other American colonists formed the Willamette Cattle Company in 1837 to bring over 600 head of cattle to the Willamette Valley, with about half of its shares purchased by McLoughlin. Over 700 U.S settlers arrived via the Oregon Trail in the &quot;Great Migration of 1843&quot;. The Provisional Government of Oregon was established in the Willamette Valley during 1843 as well. Its rule was limited to those interested Americans and former French-Canadian HBC employees in the valley.

===John Floyd===
The first attempts by the American Government for proactive action in colonising the Pacific Northwest began in 1820 during the 2nd session of the 16th Congress. John Floyd, a Representative from Virginia, spearheaded a report that would &quot;authorize the occupation of the Columbia River, and to regulated trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes thereon.&quot; Additionally the bill called for cultivating commercial relations with the Qing Empire and the Tokugawa shogunate. His interest in the distant region likely began after meeting former PFC employee Russell Farnham. Floyd had the support of fellow Virginian Representative Thomas Van Swearingen and Representative Thomas Metcalfe of Kentucky. The bill was presented to both the House and to President Monroe. In the House, Floyd&#x27;s bill was defended by one member who stated that it did not &quot;attempt a colonial settlement. The territory proposed to be occupied is already a part of the United States.&quot; Monroe inquired the opinion of Secretary of State John Quincy Adams for potential revisions. Adams retorted that &quot;The paper was a tissue of errors in fact and abortive reasoning, of invidious reflections and rude invectives. There was nothing could purify it but the fire.&quot; Read twice before the legislature, &quot;most of the members not considering it a serious proceeding&quot;, it did not pass.

Floyd continued to authorise legislation calling for an American colony on the Pacific. His career as a Representative ended in 1829, with the Oregon Question not discussed at Congress until 1837. The northern border proposed by Floyd was at first the 53°, and later 54°40′. These bills were still met with the apathy or opposition of other Congressional members, one in particular being tabled for consideration by a vote of 100 to 61. Missouri Senator Thomas H. Benton became a vocal supporter of Floyd&#x27;s efforts, and thought that they would &quot;plant the germ of a powerful and independent Power beyond the Rockies&quot;. John C. Calhoun, then Secretary of War, while somewhat interested in Floyd&#x27;s considered bills, gave his opinion to that the HBC was an economic threat to American commercial interests in the west.

===1844 presidential election===
The 1844 presidential election was a definitive turning point for the United States. Admitting the Texas Republic by diplomatic negotiations to begin a process of annexation of Texas into the nation was a contentious topic. At the same time, the Oregon Question &quot;became a weapon in a struggle for domestic political power&quot;. At the Democratic National Convention, the party platform asserted &quot;That our title to the whole of the Territory of Oregon is clear and unquestionable; that no portion of the same ought to be ceded to England or any other power, and that the reoccupation of Oregon and the re-annexation of Texas at the earliest practicable period are great American measures&quot;. By tying the Oregon dispute to the more controversial Texas debate, the Democrats appealed to expansionist members from both the Northern and Southern states. Enlargement in the Pacific Northwest offered a means of mollifying Northern fears of allowing Texas, another slave state, by a counterbalance of additional free states. Democratic candidate James K. Polk went on to win a narrow victory over Whig candidate Henry Clay, in part because Clay had taken a stand against immediate expansion in Texas. Despite the use of the Oregon Question in the election, according to Edward Miles, the topic was not &quot;a significant campaign issue&quot; as &quot;the Whigs would have been forced to discuss it&quot;.

====&quot;Fifty-four Forty or Fight!&quot;====
A popular slogan later associated with Polk and his campaign of 1844, &quot;Fifty-four Forty or Fight!&quot; was not actually coined during the election but appeared only by January 1846 and was promoted and driven in part by the press associated with the Democratic Party. The phrase has since become frequently misidentified as a Polk campaign slogan, even in many textbooks. &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot; attributes the slogan to William Allen. 54°40′ was the southern boundary of Russian America and considered the northernmost limit of the Pacific Northwest. One actual Democratic campaign slogan from the election (used in Pennsylvania) was the more mundane &quot;Polk, Dallas, and the Tariff of &#x27;42&quot;.

The southernmost border of Alaska remains 54°40′ since the purchase from Russia on October 18, 1867, with British Columbia, established as the Colony of British Columbia on August 2, 1858.

==British interest==

===Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===
The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) merged with the North West Company in 1821 and assumed its various fur trading stations. The HBC held a license among British subjects to trade with the populous aboriginal peoples of the region, and its network of trading posts and routes extended southward from New Caledonia, another HBC fur-trade district, into the Columbia basin (most of New Caledonia lay south of 54°40&#x27;N). The HBC&#x27;s headquarters for the entire region became established at Fort Vancouver (modern Vancouver, Washington) in 1824. During that year George Simpson while discussing the company&#x27;s &quot;uncertain tenure of the Columbia&quot; with Governor Colville, discussed the possibility of closing operations along the river. &quot;If the Americans settle on the mouth of the Columbia it would in my opinion be necessary to abandon the Coast [south of the river]&quot;. Simpson stated, with the company posts to &quot;move to the Northward&quot;. At its pinnacle in the late 1830s and early 1840s, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees.

===Domestic===
The &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; declared the Pacific Northwest &quot;the last corner of the earth left free for the occupation of a civilized race. When Oregon shall be colonised, the map of the world may be considered as filled up.&quot;

===Naval presence===
Royal Navy ships were dispatched to the Pacific Northwest throughout the decades, to both expand cartographical knowledge and protect fur trading stations. The British established the Pacific Station in 1826 at Valparaíso, Chile, increasing the strategic capabilities of their navy. A squadron was moved there and later vessels sent to the Pacific Northwest were based out of the port. was in the region during 1818. The next surveying expedition was commenced by and in 1837, with operations lasting until 1839. Dispatched from the Pacific Station to gather intelligence on the HBC posts, arrived at the Columbia River in July 1844. Chief Factor James Douglas complained that the naval officers &quot;had more taste for a lark than a &#x27;musty&#x27; lecture on politics or the greater national interests in question.&quot; The &quot;Modeste&quot; visited the HBC trading posts of Forts George, Vancouver, Victoria and Simpson.

==Political efforts during Tyler presidency==
Missouri Senator Lewis Linn tabled legislation in 1842, inspired in part by Floyd&#x27;s previous efforts. Linn&#x27;s bill called for the government to create land grants for men interested in settling the Pacific Northwest. The arrival of Baron Ashburton in April 1842, sent to resolve several territorial disputes with the United States, delayed Linn&#x27;s legislation. Initially focusing on the Pacific Northwest, Ashburton presented Secretary of State Daniel Webster the 1824 partition proposal made by Canning of a division along the Columbia River. Webster rejected the offer for the same reasons it was previously repudiated; the division would leave the United States with no suitable locations for a large Pacific port. Webster suggested that Ashburton&#x27;s proposal may have been found acceptable by the Americans, if the United States could be compensated with the Mexican owned San Francisco Bay. Ashburton passed on the offer to his superiors, but no further action was taken. Both diplomats became focused on settling the Aroostook War and formulated the Webster–Ashburton Treaty.

At the final session of the 27th Congress on 19 December 1842, Linn presented a similar bill to colonize the Pacific Northwest, as he put it, &quot;by the Anglo-American race, which will extend our limits from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.&quot; Arguments over the bill lasted over a month, and it was eventually passed in the Senate 24–22. In opposition to Linn&#x27;s bill, Calhoun famously declared that the U.S. government should pursue a policy of &quot;wise and masterly inactivity&quot; in Oregon, letting settlement determine the eventual boundary. Many of Calhoun&#x27;s fellow Democrats, however, soon began to advocate a more direct approach.

By early 1843, Webster returned to the Oregon Question, formalising a plan that included the 1826 British offer of the Olympic Peninsula enclave and the purchase of Alta California from Mexico. The increasing hostility President Tyler had with the Whig Party led to Webster&#x27;s disinterest in continuing to act as the Secretary of State and his plan was shelved. The American minister to the UK, Edward Everett, was given authority to negotiate with British officials to settle the Oregon Question in October 1843. Meeting with Prime Minister Robert Peel&#x27;s Foreign Secretary, Earl of Aberdeen on 29 November, Everett presented the terms considered by President John Tyler. The old offer of the 49th parallel was once more presented, along with a guarantee to free access to the Columbia River. However during President Tyler&#x27;s State of the Union address that year on 6 December, he claimed &quot;the entire region of country lying on the Pacific and embraced within 42° and 54°40′ of north latitude&quot;. After receiving this declaration, Aberdeen began to consult with the committee and Governor Pelly, previously left out of the most recent diplomatic exchanges.

==Polk presidency==
In his March 1845 inaugural address, President Polk quoted from the party platform, saying that the U.S. title to Oregon was &quot;clear and unquestionable&quot;. Tensions grew, with both sides moving to strengthen border fortifications in anticipation of war. Despite Polk&#x27;s bold language, he was actually prepared to compromise, and had no real desire to go to war over Oregon. He believed that a firm stance would compel the British to accept a resolution agreeable to the United States. While meeting with Representative James A. Black on 4 January 1846, Polk stated that &quot;the only way to treat John Bull was to look him straight in the eye ... if Congress faultered ... John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands&quot;. But Polk&#x27;s position on Oregon was not mere posturing: he genuinely believed that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire region. He rejected British offers to settle the dispute through arbitration, fearing that no impartial third party could be found.

Many newspaper editors in the United States clamored for Polk to claim the entire region as the Democrats had proposed in the 1844 campaign. Headlines like &quot;The Whole of Oregon or None&quot; by &quot;The Union&quot; editor Thomas Ritchie appeared on 6 November 1845. In a column in the &quot;New York Morning News&quot; on December 27, 1845, editor John L. O&#x27;Sullivan argued that the United States should claim all of Oregon &quot;by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us&quot;. Soon afterwards, the term &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; became a standard phrase for expansionists, and a permanent part of the American lexicon. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s version of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; was not a call for war, but such calls were soon forthcoming.

After Polk&#x27;s inauguration, British diplomats began to receive instructions influenced from HBC officials like Simpson, whose suggestions were transmitted through Pelly and then Aberdeen to the British Ambassador Richard Pakenham. In a letter written to Calhoun in August 1844, Pakenham pressed for a border along the Columbia River. He made an offer that likely originated from Simpson: Americans could select naval bases on the portion of Vancouver Island south of the 49th parallel or along the Strait of Juan de Fuca in return. Diplomatic channels continued negotiations throughout 1844; by early 1845 Everett reported the willingness of Aberdeen to accept the 49th parallel, provided the southern portion of Vancouver Island would become British territory.

In the summer of 1845, the Polk administration renewed the proposal to divide Oregon along the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean. U.S. Secretary of State James Buchanan on 12 July offered the British any desired ports on the portion of Vancouver Island south of this line, though navigation rights of the Columbia River were not included. Because this proposal fell short of the Tyler administration&#x27;s earlier offer, Pakenham rejected the offer without first contacting London. Offended, Polk officially withdrew the proposal on August 30, 1845, and broke off negotiations. Aberdeen censured Pakenham for this diplomatic blunder, and attempted to renew the dialogue. By then, however, Polk was suspicious of British intentions, and under increasing political pressure not to compromise. He declined to reopen negotiations.

==War crisis==
===Congressional pressure===
In his annual address to Congress on December 2, 1845, Polk recommended giving the British the required one-year notice of the termination of the joint occupation agreement. Democratic expansionists in Congress from the Midwest, led by Senators Lewis Cass of Michigan, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and William Allen of Ohio, called for war with the United Kingdom rather than accepting anything short of all of Oregon up to Parallel 54°40′ north. These pronouncements were fueled by a number of factors, including traditional distrust of the British and a belief that the U.S. had the better claim and would make better use of the land.

The debate was not strictly divided along party or sectional lines, with many who clamored for the 54°40′ border were Northerners upset at Polk&#x27;s willingness to compromise on the Pacific Northwest border. Polk&#x27;s uncompromising pursuit of Texas, an acquisition seen favorable for Southern slave owners, angered many advocates of 54°40′, as the President was a Southerner and a slave owner. As historian David M. Pletcher noted, &quot;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&quot; seemed to be directed at the southern aristocracy in the U.S. as much as at the United Kingdom.

Moderates like Webster warned that the U.S. could not win a war against the British Empire, and that negotiation could still achieve U.S. territorial goals. Webster confided to Viscount Ossington, a personal friend, on 26 February 1846, that it would be a &quot;stupendous folly and enormous crime&quot; for the two nations to declare war over the Pacific Northwest.

===British reaction===
====Pacific naval forces====
During the height of tensions with the United States in 1845 and 1846, there were at least five Royal Navy vessels operating in the Pacific Northwest.

 The 80-gun ship-of-the-line was deployed to Valparaíso under the commander in chief, Rear Admiral Sir George Seymour, in 1845, with orders to report on the situation in the region. , under the command of Captain John Gordon (younger brother Foreign Secretary Aberdeen), was therefore sent north that year. Roderick Finlayson gave a tour of Vancouver Island to the visiting naval officers, where Gordon aired his negative appraisal of the Northwest region. During a deer hunt on the island, Gordon informed Finlayson that he &quot;would not give one of the barren hills of Scotland for all he saw around him&quot;. &quot;America&quot; departed from the Strait of Juan de Fuca on October 1.
HMS Modeste entered the Columbia River and arrived at Fort Vancouver on November 30, 1845, where it remained until May 4, 1847. &quot;Modeste&quot;, an 18 gun sloop was not favorably viewed by American colonists in the Willamette Valley, who felt threatened by the large warship&#x27;s presence. Relations were improved when the officers organized a ball at Vancouver on February 3, 1846, later theatrical performances by the ship&#x27;s crew, including &quot;Love in a Village&quot; and &quot;The Mock Doctor&quot;, along with picnics.

 was the first reinforcement, ordered from the Pacific Station by Rear Admiral Seymour in January 1846. Captain Duntze was to &quot;afford Protection to Her Majesty&#x27;s Subjects in Oregon and the North West Coast&quot; and avoid any potential confrontations with American settlers. On May 5, &quot;Fisgard&quot; reached Fort Victoria, later moving to Fort Nisqually on the 18th, where it remained until October. Sent to aid other British vessels navigate difficult channels and rivers, , a paddle steamer, arrived at the Strait of Juan de Fuca in June. Two survey ships were dispatched from Plymouth in June 1845, and , for charting the coast of the Americas. The vessels reached Cape Flattery on 24 June 1846. &quot;Cormorant&quot; towed &quot;Herald&quot; to Fort Victoria three days later. &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Pandora&quot; spent several months charting Puget Sound and Vancouver Island until 2 September, when the vessels sailed for Alta California. &quot;Fisgard&quot; and &quot;Cormorant&quot; both departed for Valparaíso in October. As &quot;Modeste&quot; was the only British ship in the region during 1847, the Oregon Treaty &quot;seemed to have taken the edge off of the Royal Navy&#x27;s interest in the Northwest Coast&quot;.

====War plan====
Due to his extensive travels throughout the western stations of the HBC, Governor Pelly instructed George Simpson to draft a plan for the British Government if hostilities were to arise with the Americans. Finalizing the proposal on March 29, 1845, Simpson called for two areas to launch offensives. The Red River Colony would be the base of operations for forays into the Great Plains, an expansive region then only lightly colonized by Americans. A militia composed of Métis riflemen and neighboring First Nations like the Ojibwe would be created, along with a garrison of Regular Army infantry. To secure the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia River, Simpson felt Cape Disappointment was of critical importance. A naval force of two steamboats and two ships of the line would bring a detachment of Royal Marines to create a coastal battery there. Simpson hoped to recruit a force, led by Regular Army officers, of 2,000 Métis and indigenous peoples in the region. His proposal quickly earned the interest of the British Government as he met with Prime Minister Peel and Foreign Secretary Aberdeen on April 2. £1,000 was awarded to lay the ground work for defensive operations in the Pacific Northwest. Lord Stanley, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, favored the plan, declaring that the HBC had to finance military operations west of Sault Ste. Marie.

==Resolution==
Aberdeen had no intention of going to war over a region that was of diminishing economic value to the United Kingdom. Furthermore the United States was an important trading partner, especially with the need of American wheat in the onset of famine in Ireland. Aberdeen and Pakenham were negotiating from a position of strength. The key was the overwhelming naval power which Britain could have brought to bear against the United States, combined with a diplomatic and political landscape that ultimately favored the British government&#x27;s aim of protecting their interests robustly but without resort to armed conflict. Ultimately British politicians and naval officers recognized that any conflict over the Oregon boundary, however undesirable, would be decided, like the War of 1812, on the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and the Great Lakes. The Royal Navy&#x27;s presence on the Atlantic seaboard was not as numerically prominent as the American forces, yet its overall superiority to the U.S. Navy was decisive upon American decision-making during the crisis, especially their decision to compromise. Louis McLane, the American minister in the United Kingdom, reported to Buchanan on 2 February that the British were prepared &quot;to commission immediately some thirty ships-of-the-line in addition to steamers and other vessels held in reserve&quot;. Polk&#x27;s bluff had been called.

American diplomat Edward Everett contacted the Whig leader John Russell on 28 December 1845, supporting a revision of the American offer so as to allow the British to keep the entirety of Vancouver Island. He warned Russell that influence among the Whigs could stifle the negotiations. &quot;If you choose to rally the public opinion of England against this basis of compromise, it will not be easy for Sir R. Peel and Lord Aberdeen to agree to it.&quot; While still considering the Columbia River important for British interests, Russell assured Aberdeen of his support in settling the Oregon Question. While Everett&#x27;s was influential in this political move, Russell felt it was, as Frederick Merk stated, &quot;prudent Whig policy&quot; to support Aberdeen in this case.

Although Polk had called on Congress in December 1845 to pass a resolution notifying the British of the termination of joint occupancy agreement, it was not until April 23, 1846 that both houses complied. The passage was delayed especially in the Senate by contentious debate. Several Southern Senators, like William S. Archer and John M. Berrien, were wary of military capabilities of the British Empire. Ultimately a mild resolution was approved, the text of which called on both governments to settle the matter amicably.

By a large margin, moderation had won out over calls for war. Unlike Western Democrats, most Congressmen—like Polk—did not want to fight for 54° 40′. The Polk administration then made it known that the British government should offer terms to settle the dispute. Despite the cooling diplomatic relations, a repeat of the War of 1812 was not popular with either nation&#x27;s government. Time was of the essence, because it was well known that the Peel government would fall with the impending repeal of the Corn Laws in the United Kingdom, and then negotiations would have to begin again with a new ministry. At a time when the European continental balance was a far more pressing problem, a costly war with a major trading partner was not popular with the British government. Aberdeen and McLane quickly worked out a compromise and sent it to the United States.

==Oregon Treaty==
Pakenham and Buchanan drew up a formal treaty, known as the Oregon Treaty, which was ratified by the Senate on June 18, 1846, by a vote of 41–14. The mainland border was set at the 49th parallel, the original U.S. proposal, with navigation rights on the Columbia River granted to British subjects living in the area. Senator William Allen, one of the most outspoken advocates of the 54° 40′ claim, felt betrayed by Polk and resigned his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. The signing of the treaty ended the joint occupation with the United Kingdom, making most Oregonians south of the 49th parallel U.S. citizens.

Henry Commager appraised the factors leading to the settlement as &quot;a combination of temporary, fortuitous, and circumstantial phenomena, extraneous to the local situation, largely outside of American control, and foreign to American influence.&quot; Canadian Hugh Ll. Keenleyside and American Gerald S. Brown wrote a century after the treaty that

The terms of the Oregon Treaty were essentially the same ones that had been offered earlier by the Tyler administration, and thus represented a diplomatic victory for Polk. However, Polk has often been criticized for his handling of the Oregon Question. Historian Sam W. Haynes characterizes Polk&#x27;s policy as &quot;brinkmanship&quot; which &quot;brought the United States perilously close to a needless and potentially disastrous conflict&quot;. David M. Pletcher notes that while Polk&#x27;s bellicose stance was the by-product of internal American politics, the war crisis was &quot;largely of his own creation&quot; and might have been avoided &quot;with more sophisticated diplomacy&quot;. According to Jesse Reeves, &quot;Had Palmerston been in Aberdeen&#x27;s position at the time of Polk&#x27;s &#x27;firm&#x27; pronouncement, Polk might have lost Oregon.&quot; Aberdeen&#x27;s desire for peace and good relations with the United States &quot;are responsible for the settlement that Polk thought to gain by a firm policy. That Aberdeen was &#x27;bluffed&#x27; by Polk is absurd.&quot;

The treaty set the mainland boundary at the 49th parallel and retained Vancouver Island as British territory, but it was ambiguously phrased about the route of the boundary through the water. The treaty provided that the marine boundary would follow &quot;the deepest channel&quot; out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which left the fate of the San Juan Islands in question. After the &quot;Pig War&quot;, arbitration by Kaiser William I of the German Empire led to the Treaty of Washington, which awarded the United States all the islands.

Upper Canada politicians and public, already angry with the Oregon Treaty, were once again upset that Britain had not looked after their interests and sought greater autonomy in international affairs.

<text>Matilda Joslyn Gage ( Joslyn; March 24, 1826 – March 18, 1898) was an American writer and activist. She is mainly known for her contributions to women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States, but also campaigned for Native American rights, abolitionism, and freethought. She is the eponym for the Matilda effect, which describes the tendency to deny women credit for scientific invention. She influenced her son-in-law L. Frank Baum, the author of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

She was the youngest speaker at the 1852 National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention held in Syracuse, New York. Along with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Gage helped found the National Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Association in 1869. During 1878–1881, she published and edited the &quot;National Citizen&quot;, a paper devoted to the cause of women. With Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, she was for years in the forefront of the suffrage movement, and collaborated with them in writing the first three volumes of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; (1881–1887). She was the author of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Rights Catechism&quot; (1868); &quot;Woman as Inventor&quot; (1870); &quot;Who Planned the Tennessee Campaign&quot; (1880); and &quot;Woman, Church and State&quot; (1893).

For many years, she was associated with the National Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association, but when her views on suffrage and feminism became too radical for many of its members, she founded the Woman&#x27;s National Liberal Union, whose objects were: To assert woman&#x27;s natural right to self-government; to show the cause of delay in the recognition of her demand; to preserve the principles of civil and religious liberty; to arouse public opinion to the danger of a union of church and state through an amendment to the constitution, and to denounce the doctrine of woman&#x27;s inferiority. She served as president of this union from its inception in 1890 until her death in Chicago in 1898.

==Family background and education==
Matilda Electa Joslyn was born in Cicero, New York, March 24, 1826. Her parents were Dr. Hezekiah and Helen (Leslie) Joslyn. Her father, of New England and revolutionary ancestry, was a liberal thinker and an early abolitionist. From her mother, who was a member of the Leslie family of Scotland, Gage inherited her fondness for historic research. Their home was a station of the Underground Railroad, a place of safety for escaped slaves.

Her early education was received from her parents, and the intellectual atmosphere of her home had an influence on her career. She attended Clinton Liberal Institute, in Clinton, Oneida County, New York.

==Marriage and early activism==
On January 6, 1845, at the age of 18, she married Henry H. Gage, a merchant of Cicero, making their permanent home at Fayetteville, New York. She faced prison for her actions associated with the Underground Railroad under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which criminalized assistance to escaped slaves. Gage became involved in the women&#x27;s rights movement in 1852 when she decided to speak at the National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Syracuse, New York.

==Writer and editor==

=== Newspapers ===
Gage was well-educated and a prolific writer—the most gifted and educated woman of her age, claimed her devoted son-in-law, L. Frank Baum. She corresponded with numerous newspapers, reporting on developments in the woman suffrage movement. In 1878, she bought the &quot;Ballot Box&quot;, the monthly journal of a Toledo, Ohio, suffrage association, when its editor, Sarah R. L. Williams, decided to retire. Gage turned it into &quot;The National Citizen and Ballot Box&quot;, explaining her intentions for the paper thus:

Gage became its primary editor for the next three years (until 1881), writing and publishing essays on a wide range of issues. Each edition bore the words &#x27;The Pen Is Mightier Than The Sword&#x27;, and included regular columns about prominent women in history and female inventors. Gage wrote clearly, logically, and often with a dry wit and a well-honed sense of irony. Writing about laws which allowed a man to will his children to a guardian unrelated to their mother, Gage observed:

=== Women inventors ===
In 1870, Gage published a pamphlet called &quot;Woman as an Inventor&quot;. The pamphlet was described as &#x27;Woman Suffrage TractsNo. 1&#x27; and was published by the New York State Woman Suffrage Association, which Gage helped to found. In 1883, Gage published a similar essay called &quot;Woman as an Inventor&quot; in the &quot;North American Review&quot;. In both pamphlets, Gage argued that women were already competent inventors and supported her argument by citing examples of women inventors.

Gage mentioned Sarah Mather, the inventor of the deep-sea telescope; Maggie Knight, who invented a machine that created satchel-bottom bags; Barbara Uthmann, who invented pillow lace; and Angelique du Coudray, who invented a stuffed mannequin to practice midwifery. Gage also cited goddesses like Minerva, Isis, Mama Ocllo, and Leizu as example of female inventiveness. Relying on the ideas of Diodorus Siculus, an ancient Greek historian, Gage believed that goddesses began as real women who were deified because of the benefit from their inventions. Gage argued that ancient Egypt was a matriarchal society, an idea which historians today disagree with.

Gage&#x27;s most controversial claim was that Catherine Greene invented the cotton gin instead of Eli Whitney. Gage also argued that a woman was responsible for the Burden horse-shoe machine.

Gage also articulated the barriers to women becoming inventors and receiving patents. Gage argued that society disapproved of women who invent, prompting them to suppress their talents, not seek out mechanical education, and patent their inventions under the names of husbands or other men to avoid ridicule. Gage also criticized laws that limit women&#x27;s control over the patents they received. In 1883, she wrote:In not a single State of the Union is a married woman held to possess a right to her earnings within the family; and in not one-half of them has she a right to their control in business entered upon outside of the household. Should such a woman be successful in obtaining a patent, what then! Would she be free to do as she pleased with it? Not at all. She would hold no right, title, or power over this work of her own brain.In response to the 1883 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article, saying Gage &quot;squarely answered&quot; the &quot;common reproach with which ambitious women are met, that they possess no inventive or mechanical genius.&quot; Kara Swanson argues that Gage&#x27;s efforts helped to change public opinion around women inventors, though they did not convince men that women should vote.

=== &quot;Woman, Church, and State&quot; ===
In 1893, Gage published &quot;Woman, Church, and State&quot;, a book that argued the church was responsible for women&#x27;s oppression throughout history. Gage believed that the church&#x27;s resistance to women&#x27;s equality was foundational to other church beliefs and that the church gained power through influencing marriage and education laws. Like her pamphlets about inventions, in &quot;Woman, Church, and State&quot; Gage argues for the presence of an ancient matriarchy that disappeared because of Christianity.

Mary Corey argues that Gage&#x27;s book is the only historical monograph written by a suffragist that proposes a thesis and supports it with evidence.

Gage&#x27;s attack on the church was considered especially radical after the 1890 creation of the more conservative National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). The NAWSA officially repudiated &quot;Woman, Church, and State&quot; in 1913 and it was banned under the Comstock laws.

==Activism==

Gage described herself as &quot;born with a hatred of oppression.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===
Even though she was beset by both financial and physical (cardiac) problems throughout her life, her work for women&#x27;s rights was extensive, practical, and often brilliantly executed. Gage was considered to be more radical than either Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton (with whom she wrote &quot;History of Woman Suffrage, and Declaration of the Rights of Women&quot;).

She served as president of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) from 1875 to 1876 and served as either Chair of the Executive Committee or Vice President for over twenty years. During the 1876 convention, she successfully argued against a group of police who claimed the association was holding an illegal assembly; they left without pressing charges. She was a delegate from the NWSA to the 1880 Republican National Convention, the 1880 Democratic National Convention and that of the Greenback Party. Gage also served as president of the New York State Suffrage Association for five years.

As a result of the campaigning of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association under Gage, the state allowed women to elect members of the school boards. Gage ensured that every woman in her area (Fayetteville, New York) had the opportunity to vote, by writing letters making them aware of their rights, and sitting at the polls making sure nobody was turned away. In 1871, Gage was part of a group of 10 women who attempted to vote. Reportedly, she stood by and argued with the polling officials on behalf of each individual woman. She supported Victoria Woodhull and (later) Ulysses S. Grant in the 1872 presidential election. In 1873 she defended Susan B. Anthony when Anthony was placed on trial for having voted in that election, making compelling legal and moral arguments. In 1884, Gage was an Elector-at-Large for Belva Lockwood and the Equal Rights Party.

Gage unsuccessfully tried to prevent the conservative takeover of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Susan B. Anthony, who had helped to found the NWSA, was primarily concerned with gaining the vote, an outlook which Gage found too narrow. Conservative suffragists were drawn into the movement believing that women&#x27;s vote would achieve temperance (the banning of alcohol) and Christian political goals, but not supporting more general social reform. This conservative wing of the movement was represented by the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The merger of the two organizations, pushed through by Lucy Stone, Alice Stone Blackwell and Anthony, produced the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890.

Stanton and Gage maintained their radical positions and opposed this merger, because they believed it was a threat to separation of church and state. That year, Gage established the Woman&#x27;s National Liberal Union (WNLU), of which she was president until her death in 1898, and editor of its official journal, &quot;The Liberal Thinker&quot;; the other initial officers were Josephine Cables Aldrich, vice-president; Mary Emily Bates Coues, secretary; and William F. Aldrich, treasurer. The WNLU became the platform for radical and liberal ideas of the time.

=== Religion ===

Along with Stanton, she was a vocal critic of the Christian Church, which put her at odds with conservative suffragists such as Frances Willard and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. Rather than arguing that women deserved the vote because their feminine morality would then properly influence legislation (as the WCTU did), she argued that they deserved suffrage as a &#x27;natural right&#x27;. Despite her opposition to the Church, Gage was in her own way deeply religious, and she joined Stanton&#x27;s Revising Committee to write &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;.

Gage was an avid opponent of the Christian church as controlled by men, having analyzed centuries of Christian practices as degrading and oppressive to women. She saw the Christian church as central to the process of men subjugating women, a process in which church doctrine and authority were used to portray women as morally inferior and inherently sinful (see Biblical patriarchy). She strongly supported the separation of church and state, believing &quot;that the greatest injury to women arose from theological laws that subjugated woman to man.&quot; She wrote in October 1881:

In 1893, she published &quot;Woman, Church and State&quot;, a book that outlined the variety of ways in which Christianity had oppressed women and reinforced patriarchal systems. It was wide-ranging and built extensively upon arguments and ideas she had previously put forth in speeches (and in a chapter of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; which bore the same name). Gage became a Theosophist, and the last two years of her life, her thoughts were concentrated upon metaphysical subjects, and the phenomena and philosophy of Spiritualism and Theosophical studies. During her critical illness in 1896, she experienced some illuminations that intensified her interest in psychical research. She had great interest in the occult mysteries of Theosophy and other Eastern speculations as to reincarnation and the illimitable creative power of humanity.

=== Witch trials ===

Gage also strongly criticized the witch hunts that took place throughout the 1600s, interpreting them as a church-supported means of dominating and intentionally killing women. Gage uses her book &quot;Woman, Church &amp; State: The Original Exposé of Male Collaboration Against the Female Sex&quot; to highlight the connections between the church&#x27;s core beliefs, restriction of women by both the church and state, and the extremes of the witch trials. She highlights this connection by arguing that one is able to understand the oppression of women that stemmed from the church on a deeper level if the term &quot;women&quot; is substituted for &quot;witches&quot;. Gage also asserted that educated women who opposed the patriarchy were viewed as a threat to the church and thus more likely to be accused of witchcraft. In 1893, she wrote:
Gage also advocated against ageism, claiming that elderly women deserve the Christian Church to be held accountable for the extreme violence they faced throughout the seventeenth century. Gage used exaggerated numbers to further her arguments that older women were so commonly accused of witchcraft that they did not receive the affection and attentiveness they merit, instead implying that those accused were subject to a life of humiliation and tribulation, making it rare for an elderly woman to die of old age. Although not historically accurate with numbers in her assertions, Gage used her interpretations of the witch hunts to denounce the Christian Church&#x27;s treatment of women and advocated for justice.

=== Abortion ===
Like many other suffragists, Gage considered abortion a regrettable tragedy, although her views on the subject were more complex than simple opposition. In 1868, she wrote a letter to &quot;The Revolution&quot; (a women&#x27;s rights paper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury), supporting the view that abortion was an institution supported, dominated and furthered by men. Gage opposed abortion on principle, blaming it on the &#x27;selfish desire&#x27; of husbands to maintain their wealth by reducing their offspring:

=== Divorce ===

Gage was quite concerned with the rights of a woman over her own life and body. In 1881 she wrote, on the subject of divorce:

Other feminists of the period referred to &quot;voluntary motherhood,&quot; achieved through consensual nonprocreative sexual practices, periodic or permanent sexual abstinence, or (most importantly) the right of a woman (especially a wife) to refuse sex. (This was before the concept of marital rape had been codified in the United States.)

=== Native American rights ===
Gage was influenced by the works of Lewis Henry Morgan and Henry Rowe Schoolcraft about Native Americans in the United States, and used her speeches and writings to decry their brutal treatment. She was angered that the federal government attempted to impose citizenship upon them, thereby negating their status as a separate nation and their treaty privileges.

She wrote in 1878:

In her 1893 work, &quot;Woman, Church and State&quot;, she cited the Iroquois society, among others, as a &#x27;matriarchate&#x27; in which women had true power, noting that a system of descent through the female line (matrilineality) and female property rights led to a more equal relationship between men and women. Gage spent time among the Iroquois and received the name Karonienhawi – – upon her initiation into the Wolf Clan. She was admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons.

==Family==
Gage, who lived at 210 E. Genesee St., Fayetteville, New York, for the majority of her life, had five children with her husband: Charles Henry (who died in infancy), Helen Leslie, Thomas Clarkson, Julia Louise, and Maud.

Maud, by ten years the youngest of the family, initially horrified her mother when she announced her intention to marry L. Frank Baum, then merely a struggling actor with only a handful of plays to his writing credit. However, a few minutes later, Gage started laughing, apparently realizing that her emphasis on all individuals making up their own minds was not lost on her headstrong daughter, who gave up a chance at a law career when such opportunities for women were rare. Gage spent six months of every year with Maud and Frank, who grew to respect her greatly; his best-known works, the series beginning with &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, are thought by scholars to show her political influence.

Gage&#x27;s only son and his wife Sophia had a daughter named Dorothy Louise Gage, who was born in Bloomington, Illinois, on June 11, 1898. The baby&#x27;s aunt Maud, who had longed for a daughter, doted on her. The infant died in November, only five months old, and the death so upset Maud that she required medical attention. To honor his wife&#x27;s grief, Baum named the protagonist of his next book Dorothy Gale. In 1996, Dr. Sally Roesch Wagner, a biographer of Matilda Joslyn Gage, located young Dorothy&#x27;s grave in Bloomington. A memorial was erected in the child&#x27;s memory at her gravesite on May 21, 1997. This child is often mistaken for her cousin of the same name, Dorothy Louise Gage (1883–1889), the daughter of Matilda Gage&#x27;s eldest surviving child, Helen.

Gage died in the Baum home in Chicago in 1898. Although she was cremated, there is a memorial stone at Fayetteville Cemetery that bears her slogan &quot;There is a word sweeter than Mother, Home or Heaven. That word is Liberty.&quot;

Her great-granddaughter was the U.S. Senator from North Dakota, Jocelyn Burdick.

==Legacy==
In the teleplay &quot;The Dreamer of Oz&quot; (1990), Matilda Gage is played by Rue McClanahan. Her interactions with son-in-law &quot;Frank&quot; are portrayed as more hostile than in reality.

In 1993, scientific historian Margaret W. Rossiter coined the term &quot;Matilda effect&quot; after Matilda Gage, to identify the social situation where woman scientists inaccurately receive less credit for their scientific work than an objective examination of their actual effort would reveal. The Matilda effect is the opposite of the Matthew effect, in which scientists already famous are over-credited with new discoveries. Gage&#x27;s legacy was detailed in biographies published by Sally Roesch Wagner and Charlotte M. Shapiro.

In 1995, Gage was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2022, a National Votes for Women Trail marker was unveiled in Saratoga Springs, to commemorate Gage and how she helped start the New York State Women Suffrage Association in Saratoga Springs.

A plaque commemorating Gage is outside of the Gage home in Fayetteville.

The Gage home in Fayetteville houses the Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation, and is open to the public as a historic house museum.

<text>San Telmo (&quot;Saint Pedro González Telmo&quot;) is the oldest &quot;barrio&quot; (neighborhood) of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A well-preserved area of the Argentine metropolis, it hosts some of its oldest buildings. One of the birthplaces of tango, during the mid 20th century it was the Bohemian district with painters ateliers and jazz clubs. Cafes, tango parlors and antique shops line the cobblestone streets, which are often filled with street artists and dancers. 

San Telmo&#x27;s attractions include old churches (e.g. San Pedro Telmo), museums, food halls and stalls, antique stores and a semi-permanent antique fair (&quot;Feria de Antigüedades&quot;) in the main public square, Plaza Dorrego. Tango-related activities for both locals and tourists are in the area.The &quot;Manzana de las Luces&quot; (&quot;Enlightenment [city] block&quot;) hosted several colonial institutions.

==History==
Known as San Pedro Heights during the 17th century, the area was mostly home to the city&#x27;s growing contingent of dockworkers and brickmakers; the area became Buenos Aires&#x27; first &quot;industrial&quot; area, home to its first windmill and most of the early city&#x27;s brick kilns and warehouses. The bulk of the city&#x27;s exports of wool, hides and leather (the Argentine region&#x27;s chief source of income as late as the 1870s) were prepared and stored here in colonial times. Their presence led to the first residential settlements in this area: that of Africans, slaves and free, alike. 

Previously separated from Buenos Aires proper by a ravine, the area was formally incorporated into the city in 1708 as the &quot;Ovens and Storehouses of San Pedro.&quot; The neighborhood&#x27;s poverty led the Jesuits to found a &quot;Spiritual House&quot; in the area, a charitable and educational mission referred to by San Pedro&#x27;s indigent as &quot;the Residence;&quot; their 1767 suppression led to the mission&#x27;s closure, however.

The void left by the Jesuits&#x27; departure was addressed by the 1806 establishment of the Parish of San Pedro González Telmo (or &quot;San Telmo&quot;), so named in honor of the Patron Saint of seafarers. This move failed to replace the lost social institutions, however, and San Telmo languished well after Argentine independence in 1816. The Jesuit Residence, restored as a clinic by Guatemalan friars, was shuttered in 1821, and San Telmo saw no public works for the next 30 years except a Black Infantrymen&#x27;s Quarters and the construction of the dreaded Mazorca Dungeon by Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas.

San Telmo began to improve despite these challenges, particularly after Rosas&#x27; removal from power in 1852. The establishment of new clinics, the installation of gas mains, lighting, sewers, running water and cobblestones and the opening of the city&#x27;s main wholesale market led to increasing interest in the area on the part of the well-to-do and numerous imposing homes were built in the western half of San Telmo. This promising era ended abruptly when an epidemic of yellow fever struck the area in 1871. The new clinics and the heroic efforts of physicians like Florentino Ameghino helped curb the northward spread of the epidemic; but as time went on it claimed over 10,000 lives, and this led to the exodus of San Telmo&#x27;s growing middle and upper classes into what later became Barrio Norte.

At first hundreds of properties became vacant. A few of the larger lots were converted into needed parks, the largest of which is Lezama Park, designed by the renowned French-Argentine urban planner Charles Thays in 1891 as a complement to the new Argentine National Museum of History. Most large homes, though, became tenement housing during the wave of immigration into Argentina from Europe between 1875 and 1930. San Telmo became the most multicultural neighborhood in Buenos Aires, home to large communities of British, Galician, Italian and Russian-Argentines. The large numbers of Russians in San Telmo and elsewhere in Buenos Aires led to the consecration of Argentina&#x27;s first Russian Orthodox Church in 1901. Expanding industry to the south also led a German immigrant, Otto Krause, to open a technical school here in 1897.

San Telmo&#x27;s bohemian air began attracting local artists after upwardly-mobile immigrants left the area. Increasing cultural activity resulted in the opening of the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art by critic Rafael Squirru in 1956, as well as in the 1960 advent of the &quot;Republic of San Telmo,&quot; an artisan guild which organized art walks and other events. San Telmo&#x27;s immigrant presence also led to quick popularization of tango in the area: long after that genre&#x27;s heyday, renowned vocalist Edmundo Rivero purchased an abandoned colonial-era grocery in 1969, christening it &quot;El Viejo Almacén&quot; (&quot;The Old Grocery Store&quot;). This soon became one of the city&#x27;s best-known tango music halls, helping lead to a cultural and economic revival in San Telmo.

The 1980 restoration of the former Ezeiza family mansion into the &quot;Pasaje de la Defensa&quot; (&quot;Defensa Street Promenade&quot;), moreover, has led to the refurbishment of numerous such structures, many of which had been &quot;conventillos&quot; (tenements) since the 1870s. As most of San Telmo&#x27;s 19th century architecture and cobblestone streets remain, it has also become an important tourist attraction.

==Contemporary art==
A great number of contemporary art galleries, art spaces and museums are located in this area.
In 2005 the gallery and artist-run space &quot;Appetite&quot; opened and the Argentine public and media immediately noticed the crowds attending its openings and parties. Other art galleries began setting up in this neighborhood and it became a Mecca of contemporary art. 
The first to talk about it was &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine which said in late 2006: &quot;When all the movement seemed to be getting installed at Palermo, the Daniela Luna tornado opened the appetite with an art gallery in San Telmo and little by little is monopolizing the neighborhood and transferring the scene.&quot; A few months later the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that &quot;To find Appetite, an avant-garde gallery that everyone I met recommended, I had to return to one of San Telmo&#x27;s less atmospheric blocks.&quot; Many media remarked the transformation of San Telmo into a destination for contemporary art lovers, such as the newspaper &quot;La Nacion&quot; which counted around 30 galleries and art centers in 2008. Later that year, the same newspaper published another article that started: &quot;Contemporary art moved into the neighborhood. San Telmo Art District is born.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Hotspur&quot; was an H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. During the Norwegian Campaign of the Second World War, she fought in the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940 where she was badly damaged. After her repairs were completed, &quot;Hotspur&quot; was transferred to Gibraltar where she participated in the Battle of Dakar in September. A month later the ship was badly damaged when she rammed and sank an Italian submarine. She received permanent repairs in Malta and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet when they were finished in early 1941. &quot;Hotspur&quot; participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March and evacuated British and Australian troops from both Greece and Crete in April–May. In June the ship participated in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign and was escorting convoys and the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet until she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in March 1942.

&quot;Hotspur&quot; did not see any action during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but she did escort an aircraft carrier in September during the later stages of the invasion of Madagascar. In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta (Operation Vigorous). She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for most of the rest of the war. After a lengthy refit in late 1944, &quot;Hotspur&quot; escorted convoys in the Irish Sea until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.

After the war the ship was used both as a training ship and on active duty until she was placed in in early 1948. She was sold to the Dominican Republic late that year and renamed &quot;Trujillo&quot;. After the death of Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the ship was renamed &quot;Duarte&quot; in 1962, and finally was sold for scrap in 1972.

==Description==
&quot;Hotspur&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hotspur&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but this increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hotspur&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

Beginning in mid-1940, the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was increased although when exactly the modifications were made is not known. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a (12-pounder) AA gun and the quadruple .50-calibre Vickers mounts were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon. Two more Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Hotspur&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, Greenock, Scotland on 27 February 1935, launched on 23 March 1936 and completed on 29 December 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £253,037. She was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. &quot;Hotspur&quot; patrolled Spanish waters in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. The ship received an overhaul at Gibraltar between 16 December 1937 and 17 January 1938. She resumed patrolling Spanish waters in 1938 and 1939. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Hotspur&quot; began a refit in Sheerness Dockyard in August 1939, but this was cancelled later in the month as tensions rose just before the beginning of the Second World War.

===Wartime career===
She sailed later that month for the Mediterranean, but, once she reached Gibraltar, she was diverted to Freetown, Sierra Leone, to search for German commerce raiders. The ship was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in October and was refitted in Sheerness between 18 January and 6 March 1940. On 6 April &quot;Hotspur&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer minelayers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers joined the battlecruiser and her escorts.

During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April the ship, together with her sister ship, , was initially deployed to secure the escape route of the other three destroyers of the 2nd Flotilla and deal with any captured coast defence guns. &quot;Hotspur&quot; did eventually move forward and fired four torpedoes into Narvik harbour, sinking at least two merchant ships. As the British ships were leaving the vicinity of Narvik they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set on fire and forced her to run aground. eventually took the lead, but was severely damaged by the Germans, probably including one torpedo hit, and her speed dropped rapidly. &quot;Hotspur&quot;, immediately behind her, was temporarily out of control due to two hits and rammed her from behind. When the ships managed to disengage, &quot;Hunter&quot; capsized and &quot;Hotspur&quot; moved ahead slowly, engaged by all five German destroyers. and had disengaged earlier, but came back to save &quot;Hotspur&quot;. &quot;Hostile&quot; laid a smoke screen that allowed &quot;Hotspur&quot; to escape while &quot;Havock&quot; engaged the German ships. &quot;Hostile&quot; escorted the badly damaged &quot;Hotspur&quot; to the repair base set up at Flakstadøya in the Lofoten Islands. During the battle the ship had been hit seven times by German shells which knocked out No. 2 boiler, all electrical circuits, her depth charges, her rangefinder and killed 18 of her crew. Temporary repairs allowed &quot;Hotspur&quot; to sail for Chatham Dockyard where she was repaired from 2 May to 16 July.

After her repairs were completed the ship was transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the North Atlantic Command, based at Gibraltar. During Operation Hurry, &quot;Hotspur&quot;, and three other destroyers, escorted the aircraft carrier to a position south-west of Sardinia so the carrier could fly off her Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta on 2 August. On 11 September, the ship spotted the Vichy French cruisers , and and three escorting destroyers en route from Toulon to Gabon. She escorted the capital ships of Force H during the Battle of Dakar on 23 September, but was not engaged. On 20 October, &quot;Hotspur&quot;, the destroyer and her sister sank the east of Gibraltar. The ship was badly damaged when she rammed the submarine and she was given temporary repairs at Gibraltar between 22 October and 20 November. She escorted a troop convoy from Gibraltar to Malta in late November during Operation Collar. Permanent repairs were made at Malta between 29 November and 20 February 1941.

After her repairs were completed, &quot;Hotspur&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet. The ship escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. In mid-April she escorted the fast transport and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April. After refuelling in Alexandria on 23 April, &quot;Hotspur&quot; sailed for Greece to begin evacuating British and Australian troops from the beaches. On 8 May, the ship again escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they covered another convoy from Alexandria to Malta before being detached to escort the light cruiser as she bombarded Benghazi harbour on 7/8 May and sank two Italian merchant ships. During the evacuation of Crete &quot;Hotspur&quot; had to scuttle the destroyer on 29 May after the latter ship&#x27;s steering had been disabled by a near miss by a bomb.

The ship escorted the LSI(L) during the opening stage of the Syria-Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 and also hunted for French submarines. From July to November, &quot;Hotspur&quot; escorted convoys to Tobruk On 25 November, she was escorting the battleship when that ship was torpedoed by . &quot;Hotspur&quot; and the other escorting destroyers rescued 451 men. The ship escorted the light cruiser when she bombarded Derna in early December. While escorting a convoy, &quot;Hotspur&quot; and her sister, , sank on 23 December north of Sollum.

During a convoy to Malta in January 1942, the ship was detailed to escort the merchant ship &quot;Thermopylae&quot; to Benghazi when she started having engine trouble. &quot;Thermopylae&quot; was sunk by air attack on 19 January. On 23 March &quot;Hotspur&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and was assigned to Force A of the fleet during the Indian Ocean raid by the Japanese in early April 1942. The ship returned to the Mediterranean to participate in Operation Vigorous, another convoy from Alexandria to Malta, in June. &quot;Hotspur&quot; was forced to sink her sister, &quot;Hasty&quot;, after the latter was damaged by a torpedo from German motor torpedo boat &quot;S-55&quot;. After the ship returned to the Indian Ocean, she escorted the carrier when that ship supported operations on Madagascar in September. &quot;Hotspur&quot; remained in the Indian Ocean until January 1943 when she was transferred to Freetown, where she arrived on 14 February. The ship remained there only briefly before being transferred home to begin a conversion to an escort destroyer. The conversion began at Sheerness on 1 March and lasted until 31 May.

A Type 271 surface search radar replaced the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added at the top of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20 mm AA guns was increased to six.

&quot;Hotspur&quot; was assigned to Escort Group C4 in June after working up and escorted convoys in the North Atlantic. She was transferred to the 14th Escort Group in June 1944 and refitted in Barrow-in-Furness between 31 October and 9 March 1945. Escort duties in the Irish Sea followed until Victory in Europe Day. Sometime before this, the ship&#x27;s Hedgehog was replaced by a 4.7-inch gun. &quot;Hotspur&quot; was briefly assigned to the Rosyth Escort Force before being transferred to the Derry Training Squadron in August.

===Postwar===
&quot;Hotspur&quot; was reassigned to the 4th Escort Group in June 1946 until she was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard in February–March 1947. The ship was then assigned to the 3rd Escort Flotilla based at Portland Harbour. She was selected to be scrapped in November 1947 and was placed in reserve on 20 January 1948 pending disposal.

&quot;Hotspur&quot; was sold to the Dominican Republic on 23 November 1948 and renamed &quot;Trujillo&quot;. By this time the ship carried a Type 291 air warning radar and an American SG-1 surface search radar. Four Bofors guns replaced the 20 mm Oerlikons. In June 1953, she was one of a number of foreign warships to attend Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Coronation Review at Spithead. After the death of Rafael Trujillo, the ship was renamed &quot;Duarte&quot; in 1962. She was sold for scrap in 1972.

<text>Jehoahaz II of Israel ( &quot;Yəhō’āḥāz&quot;, meaning &quot;Yahweh has held&quot;; ) was the eleventh king of Israel and the son of Jehu (&quot;2 Kings&quot; 10:35; 13:1). He reigned for seventeen years.

== History ==
William F. Albright dated his reign to 815–801 BC, while E. R. Thiele offered the dates 814–798 BC.

==Biblical narrative==

The account in 2 Kings states that he did evil in the sight of Yahweh, and his people followed the religious practices of the house of Jeroboam, which included the worship of a cultic pole of Asherah in Samaria. The kings of the Arameans, Hazael and Ben-hadad, prevailed over him (2 Kings 13:1–3). Jehoahaz besought the Lord for a deliverer to relieve Israel from Aramean oppression, and He provided a savior for Israel, who is not named. The Arameans were defeated, but this left Jehoahaz with an army reduced to 50 horsemen, 10 chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers.

==Identity of the deliverer==
2 Kings 13:25 suggests that Jehoahaz&#x27;s son Joash, who recaptured a number of Israelite cities in three successful battles, could have been the deliverer referred to in , and the Geneva Study Bible maintains this view, but the Jerusalem Bible and the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argue that Jeroboam II, Joash&#x27;s son, was the deliverer, citing :
:&quot;The Lord ... saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash&quot;
The Pulpit Commentary agrees that this was &quot;probably&quot; the case.

Adad-nirari III, King of Assyria, (812–783 BC) also made campaigns into the west (804–797 BC), and on one of these incursions captured and sacked the city of Damascus, thus removing the worst enemy of Israel&#x27;s prosperity, and so he could also be considered the &quot;deliverer&quot;.

<text>Mother Jones (abbreviated MoJo) is a nonprofit American left-wing magazine that focuses on news, commentary, and investigative journalism on topics including politics, environment, human rights, health and culture. Clara Jeffery serves as editor-in-chief of the magazine. Monika Bauerlein has been the CEO since 2015. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; was published by the Foundation for National Progress, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, until 2024, when it merged with The Center for Investigative Reporting, now its publisher.

The magazine is named after Mary Harris Jones, known as Mother Jones, an Irish-American trade union activist, socialist advocate, and ardent opponent of child labor.

==History==
For the first five years after its inception in 1976, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; operated with an editorial board, and members of the board took turns serving as managing editor for one-year terms. People who served on the editorial team during those years included Adam Hochschild, Paul Jacobs, Richard Parker, Deborah Johnson, Jeffrey Bruce Klein, Mark Dowie, Amanda Spake, Zina Klapper, and Deirdre English. According to Hochschild, Parker, &quot;who worked as both editor and publisher, saw to it that &quot;Mother Jones&quot; took the best of what could be learned from the world of commercial publishing&quot;.

Russ Rymer was named editor-in-chief in early 2005, and under his tenure the magazine published more essays and extensive packages of articles on domestic violence (July/August 2005), and the role of religion in politics (December 2005).

In August 2006, Monika Bauerlein and Clara Jeffery were promoted from within to become co-editors of the magazine. Bauerlein and Jeffery, who had served as interim editors between Cohn and Rymer, were also chiefly responsible for some of the biggest successes of the magazine in the past several years, including a package on ExxonMobil&#x27;s funding of climate-change &quot;deniers&quot; (May/June 2005) that was nominated for a National Magazine Award for Public Interest reporting; a package on the rapid decline in the health of the ocean (March/April 2006), and the magazine&#x27;s massive Iraq War Timeline interactive database.

As the magazine&#x27;s first post–baby-boomer editors, Bauerlein and Jeffery used a new investigative team of senior and young reporters to increase original reporting, web-based database tools, and blog commentary on MotherJones.com. The cover of their first issue (November 2006) asked: &quot;Evolve or Die: Can humans get past denial and deal with global warming?&quot; In 2015, Bauerlein became CEO, and Jeffery became sole editor in chief.

David Corn, former Washington editor for &quot;The Nation&quot;, became bureau chief of the magazine&#x27;s newly established D.C. bureau in 2007. Other D.C. staff have included &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; contributing editor Stephanie Mencimer, former &quot;Village Voice&quot; correspondent James Ridgeway, and Adam Serwer from &quot;The American Prospect&quot;.

Laurene Powell Jobs has donated to &quot;Mother Jones&quot; by way of her LLC, Emerson Collective.

In December 2023, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; announced that it would be combining with The Center for Investigative Reporting. The merger took effect on February 1 2024.

==Awards==
&quot;Mother Jones&quot; has been a finalist for 31 National Magazine Awards, winning seven times (including three times for General Excellence in 2001, 2008 and 2010).

The Park Center for Independent Media named &quot;Mother Jones&quot; the winner of the fifth annual Izzy Award in April 2013, for &quot;special achievement in independent media&quot;, for its 2012 reporting, including its analysis of gun violence in the United States, coverage of dark money funding of candidates, and release of a video of Mitt Romney stating that 47 percent of the people of the United States see themselves as victims and are dependent on the government.

In August 2013, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;″ co-editors Monika Bauerlein and Clara Jeffery won the PEN/Nora Magid Award for Magazine Editing. Also in 2010, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; won the Online News Association Award for Online Topical Reporting, and in 2011 won the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; Independent Press Award for General Excellence.

In 2017, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; won the Magazine of the Year award from the American Society of Magazine Editors.

==MotherJones.com==
In addition to stories from the print magazine, MotherJones.com offers original reported content seven days a week. During the 2008 presidential election campaign, MotherJones.com journalist David Corn was the first to report John McCain&#x27;s statement that it &quot;would be fine with [him]&quot; if the United States military were stay in Iraq for &quot;maybe a hundred years&quot;—that what should be assessed is not their simple presence but how many casualties are being suffered. McCain said the presence of U.S. forces in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Bosnia and other countries is a “generally accepted policy of America’s multilateralism”. Also in 2008, MotherJones.com was the first outlet to report on Beckett Brown International, a security firm that spied on environmental groups for corporations.

Winner of the 2005 and 2006 &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; Webby Award for politics, MotherJones.com has provided extensive coverage of both Gulf wars, presidential election campaigns, and other key events of the last decade. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; began posting its magazine content on the Internet on November 24, 1993, the first general interest magazine in the country to do so. In the March/April 1996 issue, the magazine published the first &quot;Mother Jones&quot; 400, a listing of the largest individual donors to federal political campaigns. The print magazine listed the 400 donors in order with thumbnail profiles and the amount they contributed. MotherJones.com (then known as the MoJo Wire) listed the donors in a searchable database.

In the 2006 election, MotherJones.com was the first to break stories on the use of robocalling, a story that &quot;TPM Muckraker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; picked up. The Iraq War Timeline interactive database, a continually updated interactive online project, was nominated for a National Magazine Award in 2006.

==Controversies==

Throughout its circulation, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine has been the subject of criticism regarding the editorial position of the staff, exploitation of interns, misinterpreting data about homeless people, and promotion of values that are perceived to be inconsistent with those of the magazine&#x27;s namesake, Mother Jones.

Michael Moore, who had owned and published the Flint, Michigan-based &quot;Michigan Voice&quot; for ten years, followed English and edited &quot;Mother Jones&quot; for several months, until he was fired for disputed reasons. Matt Labash of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; reported this was for refusing to print an article that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua—a view supported by &quot;The Nation&quot; columnist Alexander Cockburn, but denied by Hochschild and others at the magazine. Moore believes that he was fired because of his defiant reaction to the publisher&#x27;s refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in Flint. Moore also felt that he did not have a chance to shape the magazine, and that many of the articles that were printed during his time as editor were articles that had already been commissioned by Deirdre English. After being fired in 1986, Moore sued &quot;Mother Jones&quot; for $2 million for wrongful termination, but settled with the magazine&#x27;s insurance company for $58,000—$8000 more than the initial offering.

In December 2013, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; was criticized for its labor practices regarding the employment of interns, as part of the Ben Bagdikian Fellowship Program. The program allowed college students to enroll as &quot;fellows&quot; who would receive a monthly stipend of $1,000 while working for the magazine in San Francisco. Writer Charles Davis of &quot;Vice&quot; criticized this practice as exploitative noting that &quot;a fellow [working] at &quot;Mother Jones&quot; earns less than $6 an hour in a state, California, that just decided to raise the minimum wage to $10.&quot; Following the publication of the article, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; announced that it would reform its budget to provide fellows with equivalent to California&#x27;s minimum wage. According to Davis, a former intern alleged that they were advised by the company&#x27;s human resources department to register for food stamps.

The magazine was subject of controversy regarding an October 2016 article about white supremacist figure Richard B. Spencer titled, &quot;Meet the Dapper White Nationalist Riding the Trump Wave&quot;, which was interpreted as presenting Spencer in a positive light in contrast to his promotion of violent, racialist views. In response to the controversy, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; deleted a tweet promoting the article, in addition to removing the word &quot;dapper&quot; from the title of the article. The 2017 video game &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; featured a newspaper article entitled &quot;Meet The Dapper Young KKK Leader With A Message Of Hope&quot;. Video game website &quot;Kotaku&quot; said the addition was &quot;clearly a shot at &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and any other media outlet who decides to start getting cutesy about white supremacy&quot;. In 2022, journalist and media critic Jesse Singal defended the story as a valuable example of investigative journalism and characterized its critics as misinformed, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s almost impossible to imagine any reasonable reader confusing it for a puff piece.&quot; Singal cited the social media response to the article as an example of what he saw as an increasing problem of slander against journalists, concluding that &quot;the Twitter gauntlet consistently destroys good journalism.&quot;

In August 2017, journalist and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; contributor Glenn Greenwald criticized an article published by the magazine titled &quot;Are People Disgusted By the Homeless?&quot; by Kevin Drum, which Greenwald asserts uses dehumanizing stereotypes of homeless people. Kevin Drum would again be a subject of controversy in July 2019, when Naomi Lachance of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticized Drum&#x27;s handling of the Wayfair Walkout in a blog post titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Understand the Wayfair Walkout&quot;. The Wayfair Walkout was a planned protest action taken by workers and employees of the furniture company to express their opposition to the companies contracting with ICE and other government agencies involved in detainment of suspected undocumented immigrants. In response to news of the walkout, Drum wrote, &quot;But isn&#x27;t our whole complaint that these kids are being treated badly? Shouldn&#x27;t we want companies to sell the government toothpaste and soap and beds and so forth? What am I missing here?&quot; In response to these comments, Lachance wrote &quot;In a cruel and violent world, full of exponentially increasing climate change, natural disasters, food shortages and wars, people cross borders in search of a place where they have a sliver of a chance to survive. That determination for life should be celebrated, not criminalized. Drum has an attitude toward immigrants that is xenophobic and deeply embarrassing for &quot;Mother Jones&quot;.&quot;

In late 2017, journalist and columnist David Corn was accused of workplace sexual harassment by former staffers who alleged the columnist of engaging &quot;...in inappropriate workplace behavior, including unwanted touching and rape jokes&quot;. These allegations were published in numerous newspapers and magazines, including &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and &quot;Politico&quot;. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; conducted an internal investigation of the accusations, concluding that there was no evidence of misconduct.

<text>HMS &quot;Hero&quot; was an H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. During the first few months of World War II, &quot;Hero&quot; searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and took part in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940, Operation Abstention in February 1941, and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April–May 1941.

The ship covered an amphibious landing during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 and began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya shortly afterwards. She was damaged by German dive bombers while rescuing survivors from the minelayer in October 1941 and resumed escorting convoys to Malta. &quot;Hero&quot; took part in the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942 and in Operation Vigorous in June. She sank two German submarines whilst stationed in the Mediterranean in 1942, and was transferred back home late in the year to begin converting to an escort destroyer. The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in 1943 and renamed HMCS &quot;Chaudière&quot;. She became part of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in early 1944 until her transfer back to British coastal waters in May to protect the build-up for Operation Overlord. Together with other ships, she sank three more German submarines during the year. &quot;Chaudière&quot; was refitting when the war ended in May 1945 and was in poor shape. The ship was paid off in August and later sold for scrap. The process of breaking her up, however, was not completed until 1950.

==Description and construction==
&quot;Hero&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hero&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but this increased to 146 in wartime. In Canadian service, the crew numbered 10 officers and 171 men.

The ship mounted four 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hero&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.

Ordered on 13 December 1934 from Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company, &quot;Hero&quot; was subcontracted to Vickers-Armstrongs and laid down by their High Walker Yard at Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, on 28 February 1935. She was launched on 10 March 1936 and completed on 21 October 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £249,858.

===Wartime modifications===
Most ships of &quot;Hero&quot;″s class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, but it is not clear if she underwent this refurbishment as she was deployed in the Mediterranean until 1943. Other changes made before her conversion to an escort destroyer in 1943 probably included exchanging her two quadruple .50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair on the wings of the ship&#x27;s bridge. The ship&#x27;s director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were most likely removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar during the conversion, as was the replacement of &#x27;B&#x27; gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, and the addition of a Type 286 short-range surface search radar. Two QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns were fitted on the wings of her bridge to deal with U-boats at short ranges. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. &#x27;Y&#x27; gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased. Late in the war, her Type 286 was replaced by a Type 291 radar.

==Career==
&quot;Hero&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. She patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee. &quot;Hero&quot; received a refit in June–July 1939 in the UK and rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet upon its completion. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until 5 October when she was transferred to Freetown, Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders. &quot;Hero&quot; returned to the UK in January 1940 and received a refit at Portsmouth from 15 February to 16 March. In the meantime, the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla had been assigned to Home Fleet and the ship rejoined them when her refit was finished.
On 5 April &quot;Hero&quot; escorted the battlecruiser as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The ship and her sister ship pretended to lay a minefield off Bud, Norway on 8 April and reported its location to the Norwegians. &quot;Hero&quot; and the destroyer streamed their TSDS minesweeping gear in advance of the battleship and her escort as they steamed up the Vestfjord to engage the remaining German destroyers at Narvik on 13 April. The ship and four other British destroyers pursued the remaining German ships into the Rombaksfjorden (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where the lack of ammunition had forced the German ships to retreat. Most of the German destroyers had scuttled and beached themselves at the head of the fjord, but the scuttling charges on had failed to detonate properly and she was boarded by a small party from &quot;Hero&quot;. They found nothing of any significance as she&#x27;d been abandoned by her crew and the destroyer put a torpedo into her to prevent any salvage.

&quot;Hero&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 17 May as part of the reconstituted 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July, the ship escorted Australian light cruiser and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the together with the other escorting destroyers. &quot;Hero&quot;, together with her sister, , and the destroyers and , were ordered to Gibraltar on 22 August where they were to join Force H. &quot;Hostile&quot; struck a mine en route on the early morning of 23 August off Cap Bon that broke her back. The explosion killed five men and wounded three others. &quot;Mohawk&quot; took off the survivors while &quot;Hero&quot; fired two torpedoes to scuttle her. The ship took part in Operation Hats in September, before refitting in Malta during November. She sortied into the North Atlantic when Convoy WS-5A reported that it had been attacked by the on 25 December to round up the scattered ships.

On 1 January 1941, &quot;Hero&quot; was one of the ships that intercepted a Vichy French convoy off Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy. The ship took part in Operation Excess early in January 1941 and was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet. On 27 February, she evacuated a few surviving commandos from the island of Kastelorizo who had attacked the island in Operation Abstention. In mid-April she escorted the fast transport and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April. After refueling in Alexandria on 23 April, &quot;Hero&quot; took part in Operation Demon, evacuating British and Australian troops from Greece. On 27 April &quot;Hero&quot; towed the Dutch troop ship , which had been damaged by a German air attack. When it was clear that the troop ship could not be saved from sinking, &quot;Hero&quot;, her sister , the destroyer and cruiser rescued all of &quot;Costa Rica&quot;″s crew and all 2,600 troops. During the evacuation of Crete, &quot;Hero&quot; and the destroyer evacuated the King of Greece and his entourage on the night of 22/23 May.

&quot;Hero&quot; escorted the LSI(L) as she conducted an amphibious landing in early June 1941 on the Lebanese coast during the opening stages of the Operation Exporter. She spent most of the rest of the year escorting convoys to Tobruk. Together with her sister and the destroyer , the ship escorted on 25 October whilst en route to Tobruk. They were attacked by Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers of I./StG 1 that hit &quot;Latona&quot; and set her afire. &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; came alongside and rescued the crew and passengers before &quot;Latona&quot;″s magazine exploded, but &quot;Hero&quot; was damaged by three near misses whilst alongside. The ship returned to Alexandria for repairs and escorted a convoy to Malta in January 1942. She took part in the 2nd Battle of Sirte on 22 March whilst escorting a convoy to Malta. Together with the s and on 29 May, she sank the north-east of Tobruk, at , and rescued 42 survivors.

During Operation Vigorous in June, &quot;Hero&quot; formed part of the escort for the covering force of the Mediterranean Fleet for the Malta-bound convoy. At time the ship still had not been fitted for radar. After Panzer Army Africa occupied Mersa Matruh in late June, the Admiralty ordered the submarine tenders and the Greek transferred to Haifa, but &quot;Medway&quot; was torpedoed and sunk en route despite the strong escort. &quot;Hero&quot; and the destroyer rescued 1105 survivors between them. On 17 August, the ship rescued some 1,100 survivors of the torpedoed troopship . In conjunction with four other destroyers and a Wellesley light bomber of the Royal Air Force, &quot;Hero&quot; sank north-east of Port Said on 30 October. The ship was ordered back to the United Kingdom, via the Cape of Good Hope, to be converted to an escort destroyer late in the year.

===Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy===
Her conversion at Portsmouth lasted from April to November 1943 and &quot;Hero&quot; was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as a gift on 15 November 1943 and renamed HMCS &quot;Chaudière&quot;. After working up, the ship was assigned to the Escort Group C2 in February 1944, based in Derry. On 6 March 1944, whilst defending Convoy HX 228 west of Ireland, the escorts forced to the surface where she surrendered after a 32-hour hunt. The submarine could not be towed to port and was torpedoed by the British destroyer . The ship was reassigned to the 11th Escort Group in May 1944 in preparation for Operation Overlord. The group was tasked to protect Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay and, together with the destroyers and , the ship sank in the Bay of Biscay near La Rochelle on 18 August. Two days later, the same ships sank in the Bay of Biscay west of Brest. In November, &quot;Chaudière&quot; was sent to Sydney, Nova Scotia for a refit.

The refit did not begin until late January 1945 and was still in progress when the war ended in May. She was found to be in the worst shape of any Canadian destroyer when inspected and was declared surplus to requirements on 13 June. She was paid off on 17 August 1945 and later sold for scrap to the Dominion Steel Company. Her demolition, however, was not completed until 1950.

==Poetry==
The ship&#x27;s completion on Tyneside in 1936 inspired the poet Michael Roberts to write a poem entitled &quot;H.M.S. Hero&quot;. The poem of twelve lines in three stanzas, begins; &quot;Pale grey, her guns hooded, decks clear of all impediment, / Easily, between the swart tugs, she glides in the pale October sunshine...&quot;.

<doc id="474404" wikidata="Q1709543" url="?curid=474404" title="High-pressure area">
<text>A high-pressure area, high, or anticyclone, is an area near the surface of a planet where the atmospheric pressure is greater than the pressure in the surrounding regions. Highs are middle-scale meteorological features that result from interplays between the relatively larger-scale dynamics of an entire planet&#x27;s atmospheric circulation.

The strongest high-pressure areas result from masses of cold air which spread out from polar regions into cool neighboring regions. These highs weaken once they extend out over warmer bodies of water.

Weaker—but more frequently occurring—are high-pressure areas caused by atmospheric subsidence: Air becomes cool enough to precipitate out its water vapor, and large masses of cooler, drier air descend from above.

Within high-pressure areas, winds flow from where the pressure is highest, at the center of the area, towards the periphery where the pressure is lower. However, the direction is not straight from the center outwards, but curved due to the Coriolis effect from Earth&#x27;s rotation. Viewed from above, the wind direction is bent in the direction opposite to the planet&#x27;s rotation; this causes the characteristic spiral shape of the tropical cyclones otherwise known as hurricanes and typhoons.

On English-language weather maps, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter &quot;H&quot;. Weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbols.

== Wind circulation in the northern and southern hemispheres ==

The direction of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a low-pressure area, as seen from above, depends on the hemisphere. High-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern Hemisphere; low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere. 

High pressure systems in the temperate latitudes generally bring warm weather in summer, when the amount of heat received from the Sun during daytime exceeds what is lost at night, and cold weather in winter when the amount of heat lost at night exceeds what is gained during daytime.

In the Southern Hemisphere the result is similar. Australia and the southern cone of South America get hot, dry summer weather from the subtropical ridge and cooler wetter winter weather as cold fronts from the southern oceans take over.

The term cyclone was coined by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to describe the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term for the kind of weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton.

A simple rule is that for high-pressure areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth&#x27;s rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth&#x27;s apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere&#x27;s pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs in the case of a high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect.

==Formation==

High-pressure areas form due to downward motion through the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs. On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as convergence, near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere, and about half the atmospheric pressure at the surface.

High pressure systems are also called anticyclones. On English-language weather maps, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter H in English, within the isobar with the highest pressure value. On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.

==Typical conditions==

Highs are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere. In general, subsidence will dry out an air mass by adiabatic, or compressional, heating. Thus, high pressure typically brings clear skies. During the day, since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight, there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise. At night, the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons. When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze. If the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form.

Strong, vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses. Once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean, the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes on the character of a maritime air mass, which reduces the strength of the high-pressure system. When extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans, polar lows can develop. However, warm and moist (or maritime tropical) air masses that move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air masses.

== In climatology ==

The horse latitudes, or torrid zone, is roughly at the 30th parallel and is the source of warm high pressure systems. As the hot air closer to the equator rises, it cools, losing moisture; it is then transported poleward where it descends, creating the high-pressure area. This is part of the Hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high. It follows the track of the sun over the year, expanding north (south in the Southern Hemisphere) in spring and retreating south (north in the Southern Hemisphere) in fall. The subtropical ridge is a warm core high-pressure system, meaning it strengthens with height. Many of the world&#x27;s deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systems.

Some climatological high-pressure areas acquire regionally based names. The land-based Siberian High often remains quasi-stationary for more than a month during the most frigid time of the year, making it unique in that regard. It is also a bit larger and more persistent than its counterpart in North America. Surface winds accelerating down valleys down the western Pacific Ocean coastline, causing the winter monsoon. Arctic high-pressure systems such as the Siberian High are cold core, meaning that they weaken with height. The influence of the Azores High, also known as the Bermuda High, brings fair weather over much of the North Atlantic Ocean and mid to late summer heat waves in western Europe. Along its southerly periphery, the clockwise circulation often impels easterly waves, and tropical cyclones that develop from them, across the ocean towards landmasses in the western portion of ocean basins during the hurricane season. The highest barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth was measured in Tosontsengel, Zavkhan, Mongolia on 19 December 2001.

A particularly hot summer such as 2003 which saw the subtropical ridge expand more than usual can bring heat waves as far north as Scandinavia—conversely, while Europe had record-breaking summer heat in 2003 due to a particularly strong subtropical ridge, its counterpart in North America was unusually weak, and temperatures across the continent that spring and summer were wet and well below normal.

==Connection to wind==

Wind flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. This is due to density differences between the two air masses. Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by the Earth&#x27;s rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction. This results in the &#x27;actual wind&#x27; or &#x27;true wind&#x27;, including ageostrophic corrections, which add to the geostrophic wind that is characterized by flow parallel to the isobars.

<text>HMS &quot;Hereward&quot;, named after Hereward the Wake, was an H-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before and the ship spent four months during the Spanish Civil War in mid-1937 in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict. When the Second World War began in September 1939, the ship was in the Mediterranean, but was shortly transferred to the South Atlantic to hunt for German commerce raiders and blockade runners, capturing one of the latter in November. &quot;Hereward&quot; was transferred to the Home Fleet in May 1940 and rescued Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands after the Germans had invaded.

The ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet later that month, and escorted convoys to Malta as well as escorting the larger ships of the fleet. She sank an Italian submarine in December before sinking the Italian torpedo boat the following month. &quot;Hereward&quot; took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941, and helped to evacuate Allied troops from Greece in April. In May the ship sank several small ships of a German convoy attempting to land troops on Crete. Later that month, she was bombed and sunk by German dive bombers as she was evacuating Allied troops from Crete. Her survivors and a number of evacuees were rescued by Italian vessels and they became prisoners of war.

==Description==
&quot;Hereward&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Hereward&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime, but this increased to 146 in wartime.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mk IX guns in single mounts. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Hereward&quot; had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. Beginning in mid-1940, the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was increased, although when exactly the modifications were made is not known. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun.

The ship was laid down by the High Walker Yard of Vickers Armstrong at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 28 February 1935, launched on 10 March 1936 and completed on 9 December 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £249,591. She tested the twin-gun mounting intended for use on the destroyers in January–March 1937 at Gibraltar. It was removed at the end of the trials and her two forward guns were replaced immediately afterwards. The ship was then assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet and began patrolling Spanish waters in the Mediterranean enforcing the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War. &quot;Hereward&quot; was refitted in Malta from 30 September to 30 October 1937 and again a year later, this time in Portsmouth Dockyard in June–July 1939 and she returned to the Mediterranean afterwards.

&quot;Hereward&quot; was transferred to Freetown to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K in October. The ship and her sisters, , , and , rendezvoused with the battlecruiser , the aircraft carrier , and the light cruiser on 17 December. They refueled in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship attempted to escape from Montevideo, Uruguay, where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate. &quot;Hereward&quot; captured the German blockade runner &quot;Uhenfels&quot; on 5 November. The ship was based at Trinidad from 20 November to 23 January 1940 and blockaded the German merchant ship &quot;Arauca&quot; in Port Everglades, Florida, whilst based there. She escorted the battleship to Halifax, but suffered weather damage en route that required three weeks for repairs. &quot;Hereward&quot; then escorted the light cruiser to the UK as the latter carried the ashes of John Buchan, Governor General of Canada, home. She required further repairs at Portsmouth upon arrival and missed the Battles of Narvik in April.

&quot;Hereward&quot; escorted ships into Scheveningen, Netherlands on 11 May to evacuate British citizens after the Germans invaded the previous day. She evacuated Queen Wilhelmina and her family from the Netherlands on 13 May, and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet a few days later. The ship arrived at Alexandria on 24 May and began escorting convoys and larger ships of the fleet. &quot;Hereward&quot; took part in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, where she was hit by splinters from a near-miss of the Italian battleship . The ship escorted a convoy during Operation Collar and then fired at retreating Italians in Cyrenaica after the Battle of Sidi Barrani. Together with her sister , she sank the on 13 December. &quot;Hereward&quot; escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they bombarded Valona on 19 December and then sortied into the North Atlantic when Convoy WS-5A reported that it had been attacked by the on 25 December. She escorted three of the convoy&#x27;s ship to Gibraltar on 29 December.
The ship took part in Operation Excess in early January 1941 and sank the on 10 January with a torpedo in the Strait of Sicily. Together with the destroyer and the gunboat , &quot;Hereward&quot; landed commandos on the island of Kastelorizo as part of Operation Abstention, but they were overwhelmed by an Italian counter-attack. Only a few survivors were taken off two days later. The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in early March 1941 and the evacuation of Greece in April 1941. &quot;Hereward&quot;, her sister ship , the destroyer and cruiser rescued all the crew and all 2,600 troops from the Dutch troop ship on 27 April. She sank a number of fishing boats transporting German troops to Crete on 21 May, and helped evacuate the Allied garrison of Heraklion on 29 May carrying 450 troops on board. Later that day she was attacked by German Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers and hit by one bomb just in front of her forward funnel. She turned towards the nearby coast of Crete, but was sunk by further air attacks off Cape Sideros. The bomb that sank the ship was dropped by a Ju 87 belonging to III./&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 2 (StG 2–Dive Bomber Wing 2). Four officers and 72 crewmen were killed, but the 89 survivors, along with the majority of the evacuees were rescued and taken prisoner by Italian MAS torpedo boats and the destroyer .

<doc id="474406" wikidata="Q246428" url="?curid=474406" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2004">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplay. In 2004, there were 11 singles that topped the chart. Although there were 12 singles that claimed the top spot in the 52 issues of the chart, hip hop duo Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; began its peak position in 2003, and is thus excluded.

In 2004, 13 acts achieved their first U.S. number-one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest, including Sleepy Brown, Twista, Kanye West, Jamie Foxx, Lil Jon, Fantasia Barrino, Juvenile, Soulja Slim, Terror Squad, Ciara, Petey Pablo, Snoop Dogg, and Pharrell. Barrino and Ciara were the only acts to have earned a number-one debut single this year. R&amp;B singer Usher had four number-one singles that appeared in the 2004 issues, and Outkast had two. Soulja Slim became the sixth artist to have a number one song posthumously, after his death in November 2003. During the year, seven collaboration singles reached the number-one position, tying the record set in 2003.

Usher&#x27;s &quot;Yeah!&quot; is the longest-running number-one single of 2004, remaining in that position for 12 straight weeks. It is followed by his other single &quot;Burn&quot;, whose streak on the top spot reached eight non-consecutive weeks. Other singles with extended chart runs include Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot;, which features Petey Pablo, and Usher&#x27;s &quot;My Boo&quot;, a duet with Alicia Keys, each topping the chart for seven and six weeks, respectively.

Usher is the most successful act of 2004. He had four singles that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;Yeah!, &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;Confessions Part II&quot;, and &quot;My Boo&quot;; he is the only act in 2004 to have earned multiple number-one singles. Overall, Usher had 28 weeks on top in a calendar year, becoming the first act to have achieved such an extended chart run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The feat broke the record set by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra in 1940; their records spent 26 consecutive weeks at the top spot of Record Buying Guide, a jukebox chart &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine published in the late 1930s and early 1940s. &quot;Yeah!&quot; is the best-performing single of the calendar year, having topped the Top Hot 100 Hits of 2004.

Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts by R&amp;B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 were performed by African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&amp;B hits that year. Along with Usher&#x27;s streak of singles, Top 40 radio and both pop and R&amp;B charts were topped by OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, Terror Squad&#x27;s &quot;Lean Back&quot;, and Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot;. Chris Molanphy of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; later remarked that &quot;by the early 2000s, urban music &quot;was&quot; pop music.&quot;

<text>Anza-Borrego Desert State Park (, &quot;&quot;) is a California State Park located within the Colorado Desert of Southern California, United States. The park takes its name from 18th century Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza and &quot;borrego&quot;, a Spanish word for sheep. With that includes one-fifth of San Diego County, it is the largest state park in California and the third largest state park nationally.

The park occupies eastern San Diego County and reaches into Imperial and Riverside counties, enveloping two communities: Borrego Springs, which is home to the park&#x27;s headquarters, and Shelter Valley.

==Geography==
The park is an anchor in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve, and adjacent to the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument.

The great bowl of the surrounding desert is surrounded by mountains, with the Vallecito Mountains to the south and the highest Santa Rosa Mountains to the north which are in the wilderness area, without paved roads and with the only year-round creeks.

Blair Valley is a valley in the State Park.
It consists of the main Blair Valley and Little Blair Valley separated by a small mountain range over which &quot;Foot and Walker Pass&quot; leads.
To the west of the valley lies Granite Mountain, to the east the range of Vallecito Mountains.

The valley can be crossed by dirt roads, e.g., to reach a look-out point over &quot;Smuggler Canyon&quot; or sites of Indian pre-Hispanic art.

Borrego Palm Canyon is the site of park headquarters and has &quot;the most famous view point in the park, overlooking barren, spectacularly eroded Borrego Badlands.&quot; Tamarisk Grove hosts a campground and is close to Yaqui Well, a &quot;historic watering spot...with magnificent desert ironwood trees and a busy wildlife population.&quot;

==Visiting==

The park has of dirt roads, 12 designated wilderness areas, and of hiking trails. Park information and maps are available in the visitor center. The park has Wi-Fi access.

The park is approximately a two-hour drive northeast from San Diego, southeast from Riverside or Irvine, and south from Palm Springs. Access on the east-Coachella Valley side is via County Route S22 and State Route 78. Access on the west-Pacific Ocean side is via California County Route S2 and State Route 78. SR-79 provides access through the high and forested Laguna Mountains, such as in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. These highways climb from the coast to above sea level, then descend down into the Borrego Valley in the center of the park. Access from the south is via the southern portion of S2.

A popular site to hike to near the visitor center is Hellhole Palms, a grove of California fan palms in Hellhole Canyon near Maidenhair Falls. The park also provides access points to the Pacific Crest Trail and the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.

Stargazing is another activity at Anza-Borrego. The park was designated an International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2018.

Ecotourism is big for Anza-Borrego. On average, the population of Borrego Springs increases by about 580% in peak wildflower superbloom season. This is a shift from around 3400 long term residents to around 200,000 tourists.

==Flora and fauna==

The habitats are primarily within the Colorado Desert ecosystem of the Sonoran Desert ecoregion. The higher extreme northern and eastern sections in the Peninsular Ranges are in the California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The park has about 600 species of native plants.

The park contains &quot;bajadas&quot; and desert washes; rock formations and colorful badlands, large arid landscapes, and mountains.

The bajadas are predominantly creosote bush-bur sage with creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;) and the palo verde-cactus shrub ecosystems with the palo verde tree (&quot;Parkinsonia microphylla&quot;), cacti, and ocotillo. In the washes, Colorado/Sonoran microphylla woodlands can be found. These woodlands include such plants as smoke tree (&quot;Psorothamnus spinosus&quot;), velvet mesquite (&quot;Prosopis velutina&quot;), and catclaw (&quot;Acacia greggii&quot;). The park is home to elephant trees (&quot;Bursera microphylla&quot;), which are &quot;fairly common in parts of Baja California but north of the border practically confined to the Anza-Borrego region.&quot;

The park has natural springs and oases, with the state&#x27;s only native palm, the California fan palm. Seasonal wildflower displays can be seen in many plant community association throughout the park. Superblooms, one of the biggest Anza-Borrego State Park attractions, are indispensable indicators of the increasingly severe implications of climate change, precipitation levels, and shifting seasonal starting and ending periods. Superblooms are fundamental healthy and natural aspects to this desert, as it boosts the local economy with the influx of tourism and is vital player in the desert biome.

The high-country to the north and east has closed-cone pine forests, manzanitas and oak woodlands.

The oases are prolific with many types of fauna, especially for bird-watching. Throughout the park, visitors may see bighorn sheep, mountain lions, badgers, kit foxes, mule deer, coyotes, greater roadrunners, golden eagles, black-tailed jackrabbits, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, deer mouse, quail, and prairie falcons. In the reptile class, desert iguanas, chuckwallas, and the red diamond rattlesnakes can be seen.

Anza-Borrego Desert State Park is home to multiple endangered species. Unfortunately, the building of roads and highways have a severe effect upon these species and roadkills are cause for serious concern. Roads not only contribute to habitat fragmentation which starkly divides ecosystems, but led to 18 roadkillings within just 5 days in a recent study done in 2018.

===Bighorn sheep===
Some areas are habitats for the desert bighorn sheep. The peninsula bighorn sheep reside in Anza-Borrego. They have been federally endangered since 1998 and are one of the most iconic species of this state park. Observers count this endangered species to study the population, and monitor its current decline from human encroachment. The two biggest threats to bighorn sheep populations are anthropogenic influences and climate change. As humans continue to develop in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and the surrounding area, bighorn sheep continue to lose their habitat. Coupled with the increasing extreme temperatures and decrease in precipitation, bighorn shape face a decreasing free-standing water availability crisis. Bighorn sheep face considerable habitat loss at the hands of humans ranging from water diversion to noise pollution and habitat fragmentation. As critical members of this desert biome, it is important to recognize the necessity to protect them and mitigate our impact on their limited and unique environment.

==Climate and its impact on the landscape==
Anza-Borrego State Park is located in the Colorado Desert Region of Southern California which is an extension of the Mexican Sonoran Desert. The Koppen Climate classification for Anza Borrego Desert State Park is BWh. The characteristics of this climate are typically hot and arid along with a deficiency in precipitation due to the continental tropical air mass which has very dry warm air. As climate change increases there is potential for wetter years which bring about &quot;super blooms,&quot; that boost tourism during the winter and early spring. Locals began to rely on seasonal tourism to boost their economies, and, along with wet years climate change has threatened the economy as it has the ability to produce longer droughts which threaten the tourist dependent towns nearby. As the environment changes with climate desertification, locals and developers search for ways to maintain tourism, some attempt to maintain steady tourism with mega development of resorts or artificial oases. However, a study conducted on North-West China deserts in 2020 showed that artificial oases vegetation is not acclimated to drought conditions, and they consume large amounts of groundwater which deplete the water table level and outcompete native vegetation that store water in their roots. Since deserts have such extreme weather, the species that inhabit them are highly dependent on each other, and developing on deserts or creating artificial oases will not only impact vegetation but also animals.   

==Geology and paleontology==
The expanses of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park&#x27;s eroded badlands also provide a different view into the region&#x27;s long-vanished tropical past. The inland of southeastern California was not always a desert. Paleontology, the study of the fossilized remains of ancient life, is the key to understanding this prehistoric world. The park has an exceptional fossil record which includes preserved plants, a variety of invertebrate shells, animal tracks, and an array of bones and teeth. Most fossils found in the park date from six million to under a half million years in age (the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs), or about 60 million years after the last dinosaur age ended.

===Geology===

Anza-Borrego Desert State Park lies in a unique geologic setting along the western margin of the Salton Trough. This major topographic depression with the Salton Sink having elevations of below sea level, forms the northernmost end of an active rift valley and a geological continental plate boundary. The trough extends north from the Gulf of California to San Gorgonio Pass, and from the eastern rim of the Peninsular Ranges eastward to the San Andreas Fault zone along the far side of the Coachella Valley.

Over the past seven million years, a relatively complete geologic record of over of fossil-bearing sediment has been deposited within the park along the rift valley&#x27;s western margin. Paleontological remains are widespread and diverse, and are found scattered over hundreds of square miles of eroded badlands terrain extending south from the Santa Rosa Mountains into northern Baja California in Mexico.

Both marine and terrestrial environments are represented by this long and rich fossil record. Six million years ago, the ancestral Gulf of California filled the Salton Trough, extending northward past what would become the city of Palm Springs. These tropical waters supported a profusion of both large and small marine organisms. Through time, the sea gave way as an immense volume of sediment eroded during the formation of the Grand Canyon spilled into the Salton Trough. Little by little, the ancestral Colorado River built a massive river delta across the seaway. Fossil hardwoods from the deltaic sands and associated coastal plain deposits suggest the region received three times as much rainfall as now.

The Anza-Borrego region gradually changed from a predominantly marine environment into a system of interrelated terrestrial habitats. North of the Colorado River Delta and intermittently fed by the river, a sequence of lakes and dry lakes has persisted for over three million years. At the same time, sediments eroded from the growing Santa Rosa Mountains and the other Peninsular Ranges to spread east into the trough. These sediments provide an almost unbroken terrestrial fossil record, ending only a half million years ago. Here, the deposits of ancient streams and rivers trapped the remains of wildlife that inhabited a vast brushland savannah laced with riparian woodlands.

===Fossils===
This record of changing environments and habitats includes over 550 types of fossil plants and animals, ranging from the preserved microscopic plant pollen and algal spores to baleen whale bones and mammoth skeletons. Many of the species are extinct and some are known only from fossil remains recovered from this park. Combined with a long and complete sedimentary depositional sequence, these diverse fossil assemblages are an unparalleled paleontologic resource of international importance.

Both the Pliocene-Pleistocene epoch boundary and the Blancan-Irvingtonian North American land mammal ages boundary fall within the long geological record from the Anza-Borrego region. Environmental changes associated with these geological time divisions are probably better tracked by fossils from the Anza-Borrego region than in any other North American continental platform stratum. These changes herald the beginning of the Ice Ages, and the strata contain fossil clues to the origin and development of modern southwestern desert landscapes.

The first fossils, marine shells from the ancient Gulf of California and freshwater shells from a prehistoric era Lake Cahuilla, the precursor of present-day Salton Sea, were collected and described by William Blake in 1853. Blake was the geologist and mineralogist for the Pacific Railroad Surveys commissioned by Congress and President Franklin Pierce to find a railway route to the Pacific. Blake first named this region the Colorado Desert.

===Marine period===
Since the late 19th century, numerous scientific studies and published papers have centered on the marine organisms that inhabited the ancient Gulf of California. Fossil assemblages from the classic Imperial Formation include calcareous nanoplankton and dinoflagellates, foraminifera, corals, polychaetes, clams, gastropods, sea urchins, sand dollars, and crabs and shrimp. The deposits also yield the remains of marine vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, bony fish, baleen whales, walruses and dugongs.

Marine environments such as an outer and inner shelf, platform reef, nearshore beach, and lagoon, are all represented within the Imperial Formation. As the sea became more shallow, estuarine and brackish marine conditions prevailed, typified by thick channel deposits of oyster and pecten shell coquina that now form the &quot;Elephant Knees&quot; along Fish Creek. Many of the marine fossils are closely related to forms from the Caribbean Sea. They document a time before the Isthmus of Panama formed when the warm Gulf Stream of the western Atlantic Ocean invaded eastern Pacific Ocean waters.

===Terrestrial period===
As North and South America connected about three million years ago, terrestrial faunal north-south migrations began on a continental scale called the Great American Interchange, and are present in Anza-Borrego&#x27;s fossils. Animals such as giant ground sloths and porcupines made their first appearance in North America at this time.

The oldest terrestrial vertebrate fossils from the Colorado Desert predate the late Miocene invasion of the Gulf of California. These very rare fossils include a gomphothere (elephant-like mammal), rodent, felid and small camelid, and were collected from 10– to 12-million-year-old riverine and near-shore lake deposits. However, the most significant and abundant vertebrate fossils have been recovered from the latest Miocene through late-Pleistocene riverine and flood plain deposits of the Palm Spring Formation in the Vallecito and Fish Creek Badlands and Ocotillo Conglomerate exposed in the Borrego Badlands. These fossil assemblages occur in a 3.5-million-year-long, uninterrupted stratigraphic sequence that has been dated using horizons of volcanic ash and paleomagnetic methods.

The bestiary for this savannah landscape includes some of the most unusual creatures to inhabit North America – animals such as:&quot;Geochelone&quot;, a giant bathtub-sized tortoise; &quot;Aiolornis incredibilis&quot;, the largest flying bird of the Northern Hemisphere, with 17-ft (5.2-m) wing span; &quot;Paramylodon&quot;, &quot;Megalonyx&quot; and &quot;Nothrotheriops&quot;, giant ground sloths, some with bony armor within their skin; &quot;Pewelagus&quot;, a very small rabbit; &quot;Borophagus&quot;, a hyena-like dog; &quot;Arctodus&quot;, a giant short-faced bear; &quot;Smilodon&quot;, a saber-toothed cat; &quot;Miracinonyx&quot;, the North American cheetah; &quot;Mammuthus imperator&quot;, the largest known mammoth; &quot;Tapirus&quot;, an extinct tapir; &quot;Equus enormis&quot; and &quot;Equus scotti&quot;, two species of extinct Pleistocene horses; &quot;Gigantocamelus&quot; a giant camel; and &quot;Capromeryx minor&quot;, the dwarf pronghorn. Within the state park, Mammuthus remains, including two complete skulls and a partial skeleton, have been uncovered at 46 different archeological sites. Most of these sites are located in the Borrego Badlands. &quot;Gompotherium, Stegomastodon,&quot; &quot;Mammuthus meridionalis,&quot; and &quot;Mammuthus columbi&quot; are among the various mammoth fossils to be found in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. A &quot;Gompotherium&quot; jaw is on display at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley.
==Native Americans==
The Native Americans of the surrounding mountains and deserts include the Cahuilla, Cupeño, and Kumeyaay (Diegueño) Native American tribes. It was the homeland of these peoples for thousands of years, and their artists created petroglyph and pictogram rock art expressing their cultures. Common foods of their diets included the Agave deserti, jumping cholla cactus, jackrabbit, bighorn sheep, and Indian rice grasses. Food-processing and harvesting was labor and time intensive. Roasting pits, bedrock milling and grinding features, cupule petroglyphs, and bedrock mortars all lead to this conclusion. Many artifacts have been found, such as obsidian, pumice, and fish bones, which tell us that these communities had extensive regionally internal trade networks. These were all observed at the CA-SDI-813, also known as the Mine Wash Site in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.

==Park interpretive associations==
The Anza-Borrego Foundation, founded in 1967, is a non-profit educational organization and is the sole cooperating association of the park. It manages all sales at the State Park Visitor Center and State Park Store.

The Anza-Borrego Institute, the education arm of the foundation, provides in-depth educational courses to more than 100,000 visitors each year. The institute offers in-depth field programs, a fifth-grade environmental camp, citizen science research, and Parks Online Resources for Teachers and Students. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to protect and preserve the natural landscapes, wildlife habitat, and cultural heritage of the park for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.

<doc id="474412" wikidata="Q1026590" url="?curid=474412" title="Mario's Super Picross">
<text>is a Super Famicom sequel to &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot;. The game is compatible with the Super Famicom Mouse. It is developed by Jupiter and Ape and published by Nintendo.

After the failure of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; in North America, Nintendo decided not to release this game in that region. The game was made available for download on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service on December 19, 2006, in Japan and later in PAL regions on September 14, 2007, the 12th anniversary of the game&#x27;s original Japanese release - marking the first Western release of the game, which has been left nontranslated with original Japanese text intact. This game was re-released for download on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service in both Japan and the PAL regions on April 27, 2013. It was made available worldwide on Nintendo Switch Online in September 2020.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay remains the same as in &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot;, where the player must decipher the picture in each level, progressing to harder and harder puzzles. After completing the first level the player may also play &quot;as&quot; Wario, who presents a different challenge due to changes in the gameplay.

Each game is played against the clock. Opposing the picross tradition of black and white squares, the puzzles are set in stone and are picked out by Mario with a hammer and chisel. When the player solves a puzzle correctly, the black-and-white representation becomes colored and animated, and the game shows the player the title of the puzzle. When the player finishes a level, Mario will congratulate them on their progress and either bow (in the first and last levels) or give a thumbs up (in all other levels).

The player must work through levels in order to get access to harder levels, with more rows and columns. In Mario&#x27;s puzzles, if the player marks an incorrect cell, they receive a time penalty. The amount of time lost doubles for every mistake (one minute, two minutes, four, and finally eight). In Wario&#x27;s puzzles, the time counts up from zero, and the player is not penalized for marking an incorrect cell, but the player will not be notified if they make a mistake.

<text>Anzoátegui State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela, located in the northeastern region of the country. Anzoátegui is well known for its beaches that attract many visitors. Its coast consists of a single beach approximately long. Its capital is the city of Barcelona, and significant cities include Puerto la Cruz and El Tigre.

== History ==
===Spanish colonization===
Until 1535, the lands of Anzoátegui State had not been explored by Europeans. They were inhabited by various indigenous tribes: in the northeast, occupying part of the coast and even the interior and margins of the Guatapanare River (today the Neverí River) were Cumanagotes. Towards the mouth of the Uchire River, the Tumuzas and towards the center between the Unare river and the islets of Píritu, the tribes of the Píritus and Chacopatas were located. The Palenques had formed a village in Aripata, on the right bank of the Unare, where the population of Clarines is located, but its domains encompassed the Tramojo, Chocopire and Güere River lagoons to the south. The tribe of the Cochismas was located on the banks of the Guanare River and the Guaribes occupied the area that irrigated the river of the same name. Inland, other tribes like the Quacos and Cores occupied territories up to the banks of the Orinoco River.

Since 1499 the first Spanish incursions to the beaches of Anzoátegui began through the Maracapana (Dairy) hill in search of pearls sources. With the appearance of Cubagua and its pearly potential, the stretch of land included between Cumana and the Unare River became a key supply site. However, The first Spanish settlement in the land of the Cumanagotos occurred in 1586 under the command of the Captain of Conquest Cristobal Cobos, who confronted the Cayaurima chieftain, and whose defeat was decisive for the foundation of the first city, San Cristóbal de la New Ecija.
The first foundation, was followed by more than sixty years of war, until the arrival of Juan de Orpí, to whom the audience of Santo Domingo assigns the conquest of the province of the cumanagotos. He achieved his goal and in 1636 he founded Nueva Barcelona, near San Cristóbal, which coexisted between 1638 and 1670 as towns rivals because of the government dependency they had.

Today&#x27;s Barcelona emerged on January 1, 1671, through the action of Father Manuel Yanques, who orders the eviction of previously founded villages with the proposal of strengthen the defence against threats from indigenous tribes, and then establish the New Barcelona of San Cristóbal de Cumanagotos. In its surroundings were formed villages of missions and doctrines, highlighting among them Our Lady of Clarines, founded in 1594; Nuestra Señora de la Concepción de Píritu, founded in 1656, which was incorporated into the province of Cumaná; San Miguel Jesús María and José de Caigua and Nuestra Señora del Pilar, among others. Until the decade of the 1930s, agriculture, fishing and livestock were the main activities of the state. Cotton and sugar cane, together with livestock and fishing, allowed since colonial times the structuring of small towns (Barcelona, Boca de Uchire, Clarines and Píritu).

===Modern era===
Named in honor of the great hero of Venezuelan independence, José Antonio Anzoátegui (1789-1819), this state was originally called the Province of Barcelona, receiving that name from the province of Barcelona in present-day Spain and maintained that name from the beginning of the 18th century until 1821 and then between 1830 and 1864, when its name was replaced by &quot;Estado Barcelona&quot;, a name it kept until 1909. The city of Barcelona, which is the capital of the state, was founded by the Spanish colonists in 1677 as &quot;New Barcelona of the Holy Hill&quot; (&quot;Nueva Barcelona del Cerro Santo&quot;) later shortened simply to Barcelona. 

The present day Anzoátegui State was also included in the Province of Cumaná, which in turn was part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, along with other provinces (Guayana, Maracaibo, Caracas, Margarita and Trinidad). In 1810 it was separated from the province. It was in 1909 when it acquired the current political distribution.

== Geography ==

The State of Anzoátegui has an area of 43,300 km2. It is the sixth largest state in the country.

Anzoátegui is located between the coordinates 10°08&#x27;40&quot; north and 64°40&#x27;38&quot; west, in the northeastern region of the country. It borders with the State of Monagas and Sucre to the east, Bolivar to the south, Guarico and Miranda to the west, and to the north by the Caribbean Sea provides water to the territory, as are the Unare and Neverí rivers (on the second slope) and the Zuata and Cabrutica rivers (on the first slope). Most of these rivers have their headwaters in the central tables. In the flat area of the coast, there are the Píritu and Unare lagoons, both of which are closed off by coastal ridges generated by the sediments carried by the Unare river.

The main rivers are Amana, Aragüita, Caris, Guanipa, Güere, Guario, Morichal Largo, Neverí, Pao, Tigre, Unare, Zuata and a sector of the lower Orinoco.

===Vegetation===
The vegetation of the Anzoátegui State is typical temperate. It is largely determined by altitude, climate and season of the year, where areas of snow-covered scrub, cujíes and small southern species alternate. It also has a tree called caderoms, this includes resistant or environmentally adapted varieties.

===Flora===
As for the flora, the species of wood trees that are most abundant are oil, pylon, carob, oak, quebrahacho, puy, araguaney, apamate, etc. The fruits present in the State are the merey, mango, guácimo, sarrapia, merecure, querebero, corn, among others.

The characteristic flora of the State of Anzoàtegui can be seen in its streets and patios of many houses, and even its squares are decorated with the characteristic trees of the region. It is important to mention, the Cayenne, which is found throughout the region: it is a tall and sometimes arborescent bush of 8-10 mts high that presents the following characteristics. The flowers are striking and large at their best, growing up to 15.24 cm. in diameter and occur in many colors such as orange, red, pink, white, yellow and salmon, and remain for most of the year. Most have bright flashes and are bell-shaped.

A tree that abounds in its main squares and roads: El Colorado or Apamate, is one of the most beautiful, useful and most cultivated trees of the Venezuelan flora. In some regions of the country, it is also known by the names of Roble Colorado (Zulia), Orumo (Falcón). This tree can measure up to 30 m. and has as its habitat the deciduous forest. Its purple, pink, lilac and white flowers in different shades give the Apamate a particular beauty and fill the main streets of Barcelona with its flowers.

There is one tree in particular that can be found in most of the towns in the State of Anzoàtegui, and in particular in the arid areas of the state. eL Cuji: Prosopis Juliflora (scientific name) is a tree up to 10–15 m high, typical of arid and semi-arid regions, chestnut green in colour, with flexible branches with long and strong thorns. It is also characterized by dull yellow flowers. Its stem is fleshy and rich in sucrose (20-25%) and 10-20% of reduced sugars. The Cují or Prosopis Juliflora is native to Peru, Chile and Argentina.

*Unare: it is the largest salt lake in Venezuela and one of the most important in all of Latin America. It is located between the municipalities of San Juan de Capistrano, Bruzual and Peñalver, in the western part of the state and extends over an area of 4,000 hectares. It receives the waters of the River of the same name and of the Caribbean. It is a refuge for hundreds of birds and marine species such as the Lebranche and the camacuto shrimp.
*Píritu: sister of Unare, its correct name is &quot;Laguna de Píritu&quot; and it is located in the city of Puerto Píritu. It has a great variety of mangrove vegetation and is one of the most important bird reserves (next to Unare) in the country. Given the growth of the population, it is at risk of contamination.

*El Paraíso: also known as &quot;Laguna del Magüey&quot;. It is the only lagoon left within the Greater Barcelona conurbation and is part of the El Morro tourist complex. In its facilities, there was a company dedicated to the extraction of salt (Salinas El Paraíso). It is currently contaminated as it serves as a drainage system for some neighbourhoods in Puerto La Cruz.

In addition, the Kariña language (which is one of the aboriginal tribes of the state) and the other indigenous languages spoken in the state are official for the indigenous peoples.
==Economy==

The economy of the state is dominated by the exploitation of oil and natural gas. The &quot;José Antonio Anzoátegui Petrochemical Complex&quot;, located in José, to the east of Barcelona, is one of the largest petrochemical complexes in Latin America. Anzoátegui also prospers in the fishing industry, tourism, small-scale agriculture and extensive cattle raising.
The economy of Anzoátegui State is characterized by the predominance of oil and agricultural activities, however, there are favorable expectations of development in the secondary and tertiary sectors, with the installation of important industries such as: automotive, construction materials, oil derivatives, agro-industry, and on the other hand, tourist, commercial and financial activities.

The production of hydrocarbons represents an important part within the national context, occupying a considerable physical space. In the Anaco-Aragua sector in Barcelona and El Tigre are the aspects related to the extraction phase, while the industrial activities of refining are carried out in Puerto La Cruz and San Roque. Likewise, the Cryogenic Complex of Oriente is located in Jose. The largest proportion of the so-called &quot;Orinoco Belt&quot; is located in the south of the state, constituting the largest oil reserve on the planet.

The agricultural activity has been experiencing a growth based, fundamentally, in the increase of the occupied surface after having passed a prolonged period of stagnation, as a consequence of the development of the oil activity. According to the Agricultural Statistical Yearbook of the MAC 89/91, the main items cultivated in the state are: soy, peanuts, corn, cotton, cane, sorghum, coffee, cocoa, cambur, roots and tubers. Another relevant agricultural activity is the exploitation of forest resources: according to the statistics of the Venezuelan Autonomous Forest Service (SEFORVEN), for the year 1990 the entity had a production of wood in rolls of 1 033 100 m³ (0,18 % of the national total).

In the cattle activity they emphasize: cattle with 614 097 heads; pigs with 100 097 heads and birds with 4 019 816 units. The development of the state has been centered in the coastal strip, where 50% of the population is located, generating conflicts of use by the occupation of the space between the tourist, industrial oil, mining, residential and commercial activities.

Tourism currently plays an important role in the development of Puerto La Cruz and other coastal towns.

International restaurant company Churro Mania originated in the Anzoateguian city of Lecheria.

Industrial: Crude and refined petroleum, natural gas and its derivatives, coal, cement, food products and beverages.

Forestry: olive, araguaney, ceiba, cereiba, cereipo, cují, jobo and vera.

Minerals: siliceous sands, limestone, coal, oil, etc.

===Tourism===

Mochima National Park is the second marine park decreed in the country, it is shared with the state of Sucre, it gathers several islands and islets such as Chimanas, Mono, Picuda Grande, Caracas, Venado, borracha. On the coastal side it occupies a mountainous area with a group of beaches, gulfs and coves. The mountainous part is made up of sedimentary rocks of steep relief with slopes that fall abruptly towards the sea. They are giant cliffs devoid of vegetation, which form strange figures in the stone. The coastal vegetation is essentially thorny, where cactus and shrubs such as cuji, dividivi, yacure, guamacho, espinito and retama predominate. Towards the insular sector there are three species of buttonwood mangrove. Ascending there is an area where species like the vera palo santo, the guatacaro, the jobo pelón, the cardón and the araguaney can be observed. From the 900 m above sea level, the premontane rainforest appears.

Sea birds abound in this area, such as the gull, the gannet and the earwig. Towards the heights are the paraulata, the maraquera pigeon, the guacharaca and the conoto. Among the few mammals that inhabit the cloudy areas are the cachicamo, the lapa, the jaguar, the fox and the capuchin monkey. On the islands of the park, fauna is scarce and consists of lizards and iguanas. Marine species are abundant such as: sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel, cataco, lampara, yellowfin and blackfin tuna, lebranche, mullet, mojarra and snook; while in the depths species like corocoro, snapper, grouper, curvina, roncador, cazón, the blue shark and widow are abundant. The coves are rich in crustaceans and molluscs.

The following islands in Anzoátegui State are part of Mochima National Park:

*Chimana Islands: West Chimana, Big Chimana, South Chimana, Second Chimana, Little Chimana, El Burro, Morro Pelotas.

<doc id="474418" wikidata="Q4793960" url="?curid=474418" title="Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve">
<text>Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve is a state park of California in the United States established to preserve of coast redwoods (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;). The reserve is located in Sonoma County, just north of Guerneville.

The reserve is in a temperate rainforest. The climate is mild and wet. The park receives an average of of rainfall per year, almost all between September and June. Abundant fog during the summer months helps to maintain the moist conditions required by the coast redwoods.

==Notable trees==
The Parson Jones Tree is the tallest tree in the grove, measuring more than in height. It is about a walk from the park entrance.

The Colonel Armstrong Tree is the oldest tree in the grove, estimated to be over 1400 years old. It is a walk from the park entrance.

The Icicle Tree shows the unusual burl formations often found on redwood trees. Burls can weigh many tons and grow hundreds of feet above the forest floor. Why these growths occur remains a mystery.

==Recreation==
The reserve includes a visitor center, outdoor amphitheater, self-guided nature trails, and a variety of picnic facilities. Although no camping is available in the redwood grove, there is a campground at Austin Creek State Recreation Area, which is adjacent to the park. Austin Creek is accessed through the same entrance as Armstrong Redwoods and its rolling hills, open grasslands, conifers, and oaks are a contrast to the dense canopy of the redwood grove.

The Discovery Trail offers a wheelchair accessible pathway, interpretive panels in Braille, and tree hugging platforms. The Armstrong Nature Trail is an easy stroll through the grove and is also wheelchair accessible. Guides are available at the visitor center.

The East Ridge Trail and the Pool Ridge Trail are open to equestrians, although there are seasonal closures due to poor trail conditions in some winter months. Horse rentals are available through a private company that is adjacent to Armstrong Redwoods.

==Park history==
During the 1870s the area was set aside as a natural park and botanical garden by Colonel James Armstrong. After his death, Armstrong&#x27;s daughter and the Le Baron family mounted an energetic campaign involving public meetings, rallies, and car-caravans to direct public attention to the need to preserve this last remnant of the once mighty redwood forest. Their efforts were successful, and in 1917 the County of Sonoma passed an initiative to purchase the property for $80,000.

The grove was operated by Sonoma County until 1934, when the state of California took over. In 1936 the grove was opened to the public as Armstrong Redwoods State Park. The grove&#x27;s status was changed to a natural reserve in 1964 when a greater understanding of its ecological significance prompted a more protective management of the resource.

Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve was one of 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program. By May 2008 a temporary reprieve was granted, but the park&#x27;s future is still uncertain.

<text>Spatial scale is a specific application of the term scale for describing or categorizing (e.g. into orders of magnitude) the size of a space (hence &quot;spatial&quot;), or the extent of it at which a phenomenon or process occurs.

For instance, in physics an object or phenomenon can be called microscopic if too small to be visible. In climatology, a micro-climate is a climate which might occur in a mountain, valley or near a lake shore. In statistics, a megatrend is a political, social, economical, environmental or technological trend which involves the whole planet or is supposed to last a very large amount of time. The concept is also used in geography, astronomy, and meteorology.

These divisions are somewhat arbitrary; where, on this table, &quot;mega-&quot; is assigned global scope, it may only apply continentally or even regionally in other contexts. The interpretations of &quot;meso-&quot; and &quot;macro-&quot; must then be adjusted accordingly.

<text>CAM ships were World War II–era British merchant ships used in convoys as an emergency stop-gap until sufficient escort carriers became available. &quot;CAM ship&quot; is an acronym for catapult aircraft merchant ship.

They were equipped with a rocket-propelled catapult launching a single Hawker Hurricane, dubbed a &quot;Hurricat&quot; or &quot;Catafighter&quot; to destroy or drive away an attacking bomber. Normally the Hurricane fighter would be lost when the pilot then bailed out or ditched in the ocean near the convoy. CAM ships continued to carry their normal cargoes after conversion.

The concept was developed and tested by the five fighter catapult ships, commissioned as warships and commanded and crewed by the Royal Navy – but the CAM ships were merchant vessels, commanded and crewed by the Merchant Navy.

==Origin==
The German Luftwaffe had Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft with a range of nearly . After the Fall of France, these aircraft could operate from western France against British merchant ships in the Atlantic. Flying from Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport, Fw 200s of I/KG40 could reach the convoy lanes west of Britain while staying outside the range of British land-based fighters. The Royal Navy had no aircraft carriers available to provide close air cover for the convoys. The Fw 200s could shadow convoys, directing U-boat attacks on them, or drop bombs on convoy ships, without opposition and to deadly effect.

To counter this threat, the Admiralty developed the fighter catapult ship a converted freighter, crewed by naval sailors, carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter. When an enemy bomber was sighted, the fighter would be launched into the air with rockets, and fly up to destroy or drive away the bomber. Being large and slow, the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target. After the combat, the fighter pilot would bail out or ditch in the ocean near the convoy, and be picked up if all went well.

The Admiralty had already experimented with this system. They ordered 50 rocket-propelled aircraft catapults to be fitted to merchant ships. The planes were Hurricane Mark Is, converted to Sea Hurricane IAs.

The pilots for these aircraft were drawn from the Royal Air Force (RAF). The RAF formed the Merchant Ship Fighter Unit (MSFU) on 5 May 1941 in RAF Speke by the River Mersey in Liverpool. Wing Commander E.S. Moulton-Barrett commanded the unit providing training for volunteer pilots, fighter direction officers (FDOs), and airmen. After training, MSFU crews were posted to Liverpool, Glasgow, or Avonmouth where they assisted in loading their Hurricanes onto the catapults. Each team consisted of one pilot for Atlantic runs (or two pilots for voyages to Russia, Gibraltar, or the Mediterranean Sea), with one fitter, one rigger, one radio-telephone operator, one FDO, and a seaman torpedoman who worked on the catapult as an electrician.

MSFU crews signed ship&#x27;s articles as civilian crew members under the authority of the civilian ship&#x27;s master. The ship&#x27;s chief engineer became responsible for the catapult, and the first mate acted as catapult duty officer (CDO), responsible for firing the catapult when directed. The single Hurricane fighter was launched only when enemy aircraft were sighted and agreement was reached using hand and flag signals between the pilot, CDO, and ship&#x27;s master.

The first four or five ships were taken into Royal Navy service as &quot;auxiliary fighter catapult ships&quot;, and later conversions were officially named CAMs and crewed by merchant sailors. The first CAM ship, &quot;Michael E&quot;, was sponsored by the Royal Navy while the RAF MSFUs were working up. After a trial launch off Belfast, &quot;Michael E&quot; sailed with convoy OB 327 on 28 May 1941. She was sunk by &quot;U-108&quot; on 2 June.
The first RAF trial CAM launch was from &quot;Empire Rainbow&quot;, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941. When a CAM ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually launched and landed at a nearby airfield to get in as much flight time as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills from the lack of flying time during the assignment.

CAM sailings were initially limited to North American convoys with aircraft maintenance performed by the Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CAM ships sailed on Gibraltar and Freetown convoys beginning in September 1941, after an aircraft maintenance unit was established at the RAF base at North Front, Gibraltar. No CAM aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult-mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter. CAM sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with an RAF aircraft maintenance unit in Archangelsk.

==CAM ships==
Eight CAM ships were requisitioned from private owners, two of which were sunk:
* &quot;Daghestan&quot;
* &quot;Daltonhall&quot;
* &quot;Eastern City&quot;
* &quot;Helencrest&quot;
* &quot;Kafiristan&quot;
* &quot;Michael E&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Novelist&quot;
* &quot;Primrose Hill&quot; (sunk).
Twenty-seven CAM ships were Ministry of War Transport–owned Empire ships, ten of which were sunk:
* &quot;Empire Burton&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Clive&quot;
* &quot;Empire Darwin&quot;
* &quot;Empire Dell&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Eve&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Faith&quot;
* &quot;Empire Flame&quot;
* &quot;Empire Foam&quot;
* &quot;Empire Franklin&quot;
* &quot;Empire Gale&quot;
* &quot;Empire Heath&quot;
* &quot;Empire Hudson&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Lawrence&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Moon&quot;
* &quot;Empire Morn&quot;
* &quot;Empire Ocean&quot;
* &quot;Empire Rainbow&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Ray&quot;
* &quot;Empire Rowan&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Shackleton&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Spray&quot;
* &quot;Empire Spring&quot; (sunk)
* &quot;Empire Stanley&quot;
* &quot;Empire Sun&quot;
* &quot;Empire Tide&quot;
* &quot;Empire Wave&quot; (sunk).
==Take-off procedure==
* The trolley receiving bar was removed at dawn.
* The airmen started the aircraft and warmed up the engine at intervals.
* The pilot climbed into the aircraft when enemy aircraft were reported.
* The ship hoisted the international flag code F when the decision was made to launch. (CAM ships were usually stationed at the head of the outboard port column of a convoy so they could manoeuvre into the wind for launch.)
* An airman removed the pins, showed them to the pilot, and took them to the Catapult Duty Officer (CDO).
* The pilot applied 30 degree flaps and right rudder.
* The CDO raised a blue flag above his head to inform the ship&#x27;s master of his readiness to launch.
* The ship&#x27;s master manoeuvred the ship into the wind and raised a blue flag above his head to authorise the launch. (The ship&#x27;s master stood on the starboard bridge wing to avoid the catapult rocket blast which sometimes damaged the port side of the bridge.)
* The CDO waved his blue flag indicating he was ready to launch upon a signal from the pilot.
* The pilot opened full throttle, tightened the throttle friction nut, pressed his head back into the head-rest, pressed his right elbow tightly against his hip, and lowered his left hand as a signal to launch.
* The CDO counted to three, waited for the bow to rise from the trough of a swell, and moved the switch to fire the catapult rockets.

==CAM combat launches==


In total, there were eight combat launches from CAM ships. Eight German aircraft were destroyed (three FW 200 Condors, four Heinkel He 111s and a Junkers Ju 88), one damaged and three chased away. Eight Hurricanes were ditched and one pilot lost.

Additionally, one Condor was destroyed in August 1941 by a Hurricane launched from a Royal Navy Fighter Catapult Ship. This was flown by Robert W. H. Everett.

==Programme termination==
As adequate numbers of escort carriers became available, CAM sailings on North American and Arctic Russian convoys were discontinued in August 1942. The aircraft maintenance unit was withdrawn from Archangelsk in September 1942. Catapults were removed from 10 of the 26 surviving CAM ships while the remaining 16 continued to sail with the Mediterranean and Freetown convoys. Headquarters RAF Fighter Command ordered all MSFUs to be disbanded commencing 8 June 1943. The combat launches from homeward bound convoy SL 133 were from the last two operational CAM ships to sail; the last MSFU was disbanded on 7 September 1943. Twelve of the 35 CAM ships had been sunk while sailing on 170 round trip voyages. Two more ships, &quot;Cape Clear&quot; and &quot;City of Johannesburg&quot;, were briefly fitted with dummy catapults and aircraft for deception purposes in late 1941.

<text>Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park is a state park in the western Antelope Valley in Southern California. The park protects mature stands of Joshua trees (&quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot;) and California juniper trees (&quot;Juniperus californica&quot;) in their western Mojave Desert habitat.

The park is located in northern Los Angeles County, west of downtown Lancaster and about from the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve.

==History==
The site was donated to the state in 1988 by farmer Arthur &quot;Archie&quot; Ripley, and preserves a remnant of Joshua/juniper woodland which once grew in great abundance throughout the valley. Today only remnant parcels of this woodland community remain in the valley, much of the rest having been cleared for farming, housing, and some rather esoteric uses — directions for nighttime automobile travelers in the first half of the 20th century and even pulp for newspaper usage. The property was officially acquired in 1993.

The Joshua tree played an important part in the cultural history of the Antelope Valley, providing a vital source of food and fiber materials for the Native Americans that inhabited the region.

The Junipers in the park were the subject of botanical research by the late Otis M. (Milt) Stark, a Lancaster wildflower photographer and local historian who was among the volunteers who helped establish trails through the park.

<doc id="474427" wikidata="Q1586838" url="?curid=474427" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2002">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales and airplay. In 2002, there were seven singles that topped the chart, the lowest number of singles to top the chart in a single year ever (if the two songs which peaked in 2001 are included, 2002 would have the second lowest number of chart-topping singles in a year, behind 2005). Although nine singles reached number one in fifty-two issues of the magazine in the calendar year, two songs began their peak position in 2001 and are thus excluded.

In 2002, five acts earned their first U.S. number one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest. These artists were Ashanti, Nelly, Kelly Clarkson, and Eminem. Kelly Rowland, despite having hit number one with Destiny&#x27;s Child, also earns her first number one song as a solo act. In 2002, Ja Rule, Ashanti, and Nelly had two number-one singles in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Most of the number-one singles in 2002 were extended chart-toppers. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; is the longest-running single, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 12 consecutive weeks, eight of which were in this calendar year. &quot;Foolish&quot; and &quot;Dilemma&quot; both stayed at number one for 10 weeks, the latter of which was non-consecutive. &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny&quot; by Jennifer Lopez, in its remix version with Ja Rule, peaked at number one for six weeks.

Rock band Nickelback&#x27;s &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, which first peaked at number one in 2001, is the best-performing single of 2002. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, which is the soundtrack to the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, is the second most-successful soundtrack song in the entire rock era. It is behind Whitney Houston&#x27;s version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, having topped the chart for 14 weeks. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; is also the longest-running Oscar-winning number-one song since singer-actor Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; had 14 weeks on top in the 1940s. &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; is noted for its fifty-two-to-one leap in 2002, breaking the 38-year-old record set by The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, which jumped from number twenty-seven to one.

Nelly became the first act to have consecutive number-one singles as the lead artist since 1994, when Boyz II Men had consecutive number-ones.

<doc id="474429" wikidata="Q382312" url="?curid=474429" title="Nizar Qabbani">
<text>Nizar Tawfiq Qabbani (, , ; 21 March 1923 – 30 April 1998) was a Syrian poet. He is considered to be Syria&#x27;s National Poet. His poetic style combines simplicity and elegance in exploring themes of love, eroticism, religion, and Arab empowerment against foreign imperialism and local dictators. Qabbani is one of the most revered contemporary poets in the Arab world. His famous relatives include Abu Khalil Qabbani, Sabah Qabbani, Rana Kabbani, Yasmine Seale.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nizar Qabbani was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus to a middle class merchant family. Qabbani was raised in &quot;Mi&#x27;thnah Al-Shahm&quot;, one of the neighborhoods of Old Damascus and studied at the National Scientific College School in Damascus between 1930 and 1941. The school was owned and run by his father&#x27;s friend, Ahmad Munif al-Aidi. He later studied law at Damascus University, which was called Syrian University until 1958. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law in 1945.

While a student in college he wrote his first collection of poems entitled &quot;The Brunette Told Me&quot;, which he published in 1942. The presence of sexual allusions in this collection was a cause of controversy. In light of this controversy, Qabbani showed the book to Munir al-Ajlani, the minister of education who was also a friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the preface for Qabbani&#x27;s first book.

===Diplomatic career===
After graduating from law school, Qabbani worked for the Syrian Foreign Ministry, serving as Consul or cultural attaché in several capital cities, including Beirut, Cairo, Istanbul, Madrid, and London. In 1959, when the United Arab Republic was formed, Qabbani was appointed Vice-Secretary of the UAR for its embassies in China. He wrote extensively during these years and his poems from China were some of his finest. He continued to work in diplomacy until he tendered his resignation in 1966.

== Poetic influences ==
At the age of fifteen, Qabbani’s sister died due to contested reasons. When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense, and body with my poetry. The relationships between men and women in our society are not healthy.”

In 1981, Qabbani’s wife, Balqees, died in a bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, during the Lebanese civil war. The death of Balqees profoundly affected Qabbani’s psychology and poetry. He expressed his grief in an exceptionally moving poem titled &quot;Balqees.&quot; Qabbani blamed all Arab regimes for her death. 
Additionally, Qabbani used the death of his beloved Balqees to symbolize the death of Arab people in the Levant by their governments. 
&quot;Balqees:
I ask forgiveness.
Maybe your life was for mine, a sacrifice.
I know well that
your killers’ aims
were to kill my words.
My beautiful, rest in peace.
After you, poetry will cease
and womanhood is out of place.
Generations of children flocks
Will keep asking about your long hair locks.
Generations of lovers
will read about you, the true instructor.
One day the Arabs will get it
that they killed the prophetess and the prophets.&quot;

The city of Damascus remained the most powerful muse in his poetry, most notably in the &quot;Jasmine Scent of Damascus&quot;. However, Qabbani expressed his love for all Arab citizens and cities from Mauritania extending to Iraq as one people connected by the same struggle and a rich past. In the second stanza of &quot;Umm al-Mu&#x27;tazz&quot; he said:
&quot;Every Arab city is my mother,
Damascus, Beirut, Cairo, Baghdad, Khartoum,
Casablanca, Benghazi, Tunis, Amman, Riyadh,
Kuwait, Algiers, Abu Dhabi, and their sisters:
These are my family tree.
All of these cities brought me forth from their wombs, cave me to suck from their breasts.
And filled my pockets with grapes, figs and plums. All of them shook their date palms for me so that I could eat.
Opened their skies for me like a blue notebook so that I could write.
For this reason, I do not enter an Arab city without it calling me, &quot;My son.&quot; 
I do not knock on the gate of an Arab city without finding my
childhood bed waiting for me.
No Arab city bleeds without my bleeding with it.&quot;

Qabbani was a vocal opponent of colonial and imperial western projects in the Middle East. Additionally, Qabbani frequently criticized Arab leaders for their corruption, oppression, and hypocrisy most notably in his poem &quot;Sultan&quot;:
&quot;O Sultan, my master, if my clothes are ripped and torn
It is because your dogs with claws are allowed to tear me
O Sultan!
Because I dare to approach your deaf walls,
because I tried to reveal my sadness and
tribulation,
I was beaten.&quot;

== Personal life ==
===Family===
Qabbani had two sisters, Wisal and Haifa, and three brothers, Mu&#x27;taz, Rashid, and Sabah. The latter, Sabah Qabbani, became the director of Syrian radio and TV in 1960 and served as Syria&#x27;s ambassador to the United States in the 1980s.

Nizar Qabbani&#x27;s father, Tawfiq Qabbani, was Syrian, while his mother was of Turkish descent. His father had a chocolate factory; he also helped support fighters resisting the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and was imprisoned many times for his views, greatly affecting the upbringing of Nizar into a revolutionary in his own right. Qabbani&#x27;s grandfather, Abu Khalil Qabbani, was one of the leading innovators in Arab dramatic literature.

The Qabbanis were of Turkish origin and came from Konya. The family name, Qabbani, is derived from Qabban () which means steelyard balance.

===Marriages===
Qabbani married twice in his life. His first wife was his cousin Zahra Aqbiq; together they had a daughter, Hadba, and a son, Tawfiq. Tawfiq died due to a heart attack when he was 22 years old when he was in London. Qabbani eulogized his son in the famous poem &quot;To the Legendary Damascene, Prince Tawfiq Qabbani&quot;. Zahra Aqbiq died in 2007. His daughter Hadba, born in 1947, was married twice, and lived in London until her death in April 2009.

His second marriage was to an Iraqi woman named Balqis al-Rawi, a schoolteacher he met at a poetry recital in Baghdad; she was killed in the 1981 Iraqi embassy bombing in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War on 15 December 1981. Together they had a son, Omar, and a daughter, Zainab. After the death of Balqis, Qabbani did not marry again.

==Late life and death==
After the death of Balqis, Qabbani left Beirut. He was moving between Geneva and Paris, eventually settling in London, where he spent the last 15 years of his life. In exile, Qabbani continued to write poems and raise controversies and arguments. Notable and controversial poems from this period in his life include &quot;When Will They Announce the Death of Arabs?&quot; and &quot;Runners&quot;. 
At the age of 75, Qabbani died in London on 30 April 1998 of a heart attack.
In his will, which he wrote in his hospital bed in London, Qabbani wrote that he wished to be buried in Damascus, which he described in his will as &quot;the womb that taught me poetry, taught me creativity and granted me the alphabet of Jasmine.&quot; He was mourned by Arabs all over the world, with international news broadcasts highlighting his illustrious literary career.

<text>Asilomar State Beach, officially Asilomar State Beach and Conference Grounds State Park, is a state park unit of California, United States. It provides public access to rocky coast and dune habitat on the Monterey Peninsula. The property includes the Asilomar Conference Grounds, a conference center built by the YWCA in 1913 that is now a National Historic Landmark. The site is located in Pacific Grove and offers overnight lodging and views of the forest, surf and sand.

Asilomar (meaning &quot;Asylum or refuge by the sea&quot; and pronounced a-SIL-o-mar) is a combination of two Spanish words: &quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot;. It is part of the native homeland of the Rumsen Ohlone people.

==Description==
===Beach area===

The beach area is a narrow, strip of sandy beach and rocky coves. A trail, which runs through the dunes, is open to pedestrians. This trail is wheelchair-accessible, and a beach wheelchair is available at the Conference Grounds front desk, located inside the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Social Hall. Bicycling is allowed on the paved bike lane along the road, running parallel to the Coast Trail. The ocean off shore is protected as the Asilomar State Marine Reserve, part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The rocky coves are home to thousands of species, some of which are unique to the bay. As a sanctuary, it is illegal to disturb biota, i.e., collection and removal of shells and/or live specimens.

===Asilomar Conference Grounds===
Asilomar State Beach incorporates Asilomar Conference Grounds, designed in the Arts &amp; Crafts style by architect Julia Morgan. The facility was built in 1913 as a conference center and summer camp for the YWCA. Morgan designed and built 16 buildings on the property, of which 13 are still standing. The retreat was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its role in the development of the YWCA and the resort nature of nearby Monterey, California.

==Recreation==
The water in the vicinity of Asilomar State Beach is known for rip tides and unpredictable surf. The water is cold compared to other beaches in the Monterey area, due to its exposure to the open ocean and the upwelling of cold water from nearby Monterey Canyon, which funnels the icy water right to shore at this location. Despite the cold water the area is popular with surfers and visitors from around the world.

The beach does not feature a bathroom facility. Bathrooms available to the public are located at the Asilomar Conference Grounds inside the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Social Hall.

==In popular culture==
The 2009 film &quot;The Shift&quot; by self-help advocate Wayne Dyer was shot at Asilomar Beach and Conference Grounds.

<text>The Entomological Society of America (ESA) was founded in 1889 and today has more than 7,000 members, including educators, extension personnel, consultants, students, researchers, and scientists from agricultural departments, health agencies, private industries, colleges and universities, and state and federal governments. It serves the professional and scientific needs of entomologists and people in related disciplines. To facilitate communication among members, the ESA is divided into four sections based on entomological interests, and six branches, based on geographic proximity. The national office is located in Annapolis, Maryland.

== History ==
In 1889, the American Association of Economic Entomologists was founded by Charles V. Riley, primarily focusing on economic entomology. In 1906, the Entomological Society of America was organized to address the needs of the broader dimensions of biology, taxonomy, morphology, and faunistic studies of insects.

== Governance ==
Presidents serve for one year with the assistance of the Governing Board.

Executive Secretaries/Executive Directors serve for longer and have included:
*19531955 Ashley B. Gurney
*19551968 Robert Nelson, also President for 1971
*1968? Wallace P. Murdoch

== Publications ==
ESA publishes nine journals in partnership with Oxford University Press.

*&quot;Annals of the Entomological Society of America&quot;
*&quot;Environmental Entomology&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Economic Entomology&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Medical Entomology&quot;

*&quot;Arthropod Management Tests&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Insect Science&quot;
*&quot;Insect Systematics and Diversity&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Integrated Pest Management&quot;

== Branches ==
The six ESA branches include five North American branches: Eastern, North Central, Pacific, Southeastern, and Southwestern. Their members are states/provinces of the US, Canada, and Mexico, with Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Southeastern Branch and the US territories of the Pacific Ocean in the Pacific Branch. All other nations and territories comprise the sixth, International Branch.

<doc id="474450" wikidata="Q4819307" url="?curid=474450" title="Auburn State Recreation Area">
<text>Auburn State Recreation Area is a state park unit of California, along of the North and Middle Forks of the American River. The state recreation area (SRA) is situated on the border of Placer and El Dorado Counties in the heart of historic Gold Country. The largest city with close proximity is the city of Auburn. Once teeming with gold mining activity, the area now offers a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. Major recreational uses include trail running, hiking, swimming, boating, fishing, camping, mountain biking, gold panning, horseback riding, road bicycling, and off-highway motorcycle riding. Whitewater recreation is also very popular on both forks of the river, with Class II, III and IV runs. Auburn SRA is also known as the location of a number of endurance races that are hosted throughout the year.

==History==
Auburn SRA comprises lands set aside for the proposed Auburn Dam. However a large earthquake at Oroville nearby was found to have been caused by the Oroville Dam at that location, which led to examination and discovery that the Auburn dam site is situated on a geologic fault. This discovery halted the Auburn Dam project because of fears that constructing a dam and lake would cause a reservoir-induced earthquake which could lead to a dam&#x27;s collapse, with catastrophic consequences for the city of Sacramento lying directly below. As such the project has been abandoned. The project had required the acquisition of 40,000 acres of land, much of it privately held, potentially against the will of long-term inhabitants; prior to the end of the project, 20,000 acres was taken. There is an upside, as a result of the surplus land taken for the project, millions of people now enjoy the Auburn State Recreation Area in its natural state, with multiple wilderness canyons offering access to one of the last remaining natural river systems in Central California. The California Department of Parks and Recreation administers the area under a contract with the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

==Endurance races==
The state park is host to a number of sporting endurance events with the City of Auburn declaring itself as the &quot;Endurance Capital of the World.&quot; Endurance held within the park include the Western States Endurance Run, Western States Trail Ride also known as Tevis Cup Equestrian Ride, American River 50 Mile Endurance Run, American River 50 Mile Equestrian Ride, Way Too Cool 50 Kilometer Endurance Run, Auburn International Half Iron Triathlon, Auburn Century 100 Mile Bike Ride, Coolest 24 Hour Mountain Bike Ride, Rio Del Lago 100 Mile Endurance Run, Sierra Nevada 50 Mile Endurance Run, and the Coolest Run: Ride &amp; Tie.

==Media appearances==

* A stunt from the 2002 film &quot;XXX&quot; was filmed in the park, in which a Corvette is driven off the Foresthill Bridge while the driver parachutes to safety. 
* The 2005 book &quot;Nature Noir: A Park Ranger&#x27;s Patrol in the Sierra&quot; recounted author Jordan Fisher Smith&#x27;s experiences as a park ranger at Auburn SRA.

<text>Mary Alexander &quot;Molly&quot; Yard (July 6, 1912 – September 21, 2005) was an American feminist and social activist who served as the eighth president of the National Organization for Women (NOW) from 1987 to 1991 and was a link between first and second-wave feminism.

==Early life and education==
She was born in Shanghai, China, the third daughter of Methodist missionaries. Following her birth, a Chinese friend of her father gifted him &quot;a brass bowl, as consolation for her being a &#x27;useless&#x27; third daughter&quot;. She grew up in Chengdu, Sichuan until she was 13, when her family moved to the United States and settled in Connecticut. Her parents encouraged her to attend college, especially her mother, who had been denied the opportunity.

She graduated in 1933 from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science. While at Swarthmore, she led a successful drive to eliminate sororities at the college in reaction to sororities (including Yard&#x27;s sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, and her older sister&#x27;s sorority, Chi Omega) denying admission to Jewish students was denied admission to her sorority.

==Early career and politics==
She became active in Democratic Party politics, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s worked with the Clark-Dilworth team to unseat the entrenched city machine in Philadelphia. Two years later, she worked in Helen Gahagan Douglas&#x27; unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate against second-year Congressman Richard Nixon&#x27;s effective campaign attacks on Gahagan Douglas in California.

She moved to Pittsburgh in 1953, where she worked in the gubernatorial campaign of Mayor David L. Lawrence in 1958, led the Western Pennsylvania presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy in 1960 and George McGovern in 1972, led the unsuccessful campaign to get NAACP President Byrd Brown the Democratic nomination to Congress, and was co-chair with Mayor Joseph M. Barr of the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of state Senator Jeanette Reibman in 1976.

In 1963, Yard was the Western Pennsylvania organizer for the March on Washington. In 1964, she led local protests in favor of the passing of the Civil Rights Act.

She made an unsuccessful run for the state legislature as a candidate from Pittsburgh&#x27;s Ward 14 in 1964.

In addition to her political work, she helped found Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), America&#x27;s oldest independent liberal lobbying organization, and the Pittsburgh&#x27;s 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club. She was also the organization secretary and national chairwoman of the American Student Union.

==Activities in the National Organization for Women==
She became active in NOW while a resident of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1974, and joined the national staff in 1978 during the unsuccessful campaign to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), serving as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. She raised more than $1 million in less than six months for that drive.

A prime architect of NOW&#x27;s political and legislative agenda, she was a senior staff member of the NOW Political Action Committee from 1978 to 1984. As NOW&#x27;s political director from 1985 to 1987, she was instrumental in the successful 1986 campaign to defeat anti-abortion referendums in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Oregon.

She defeated Noreen Connell in the 1987 NOW presidential election. On taking office in August, she vowed to make the organization more visible and work to defeat President Reagan&#x27;s nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was ultimately rejected by the U.S. Senate. Yard demanded that President Ronald Reagan resign due to the Iran-Contra affair. In September, she was briefly arrested during a nonviolent NOW demonstration at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C. in response to the Catholic Church&#x27;s stances on birth control, abortion, and homosexuality.

Yard convinced her brother, Lou Harris, &quot;to identify polling results by gender,&quot; which allowed Harris to demonstrate gender gaps in voting.

In April 1989, she helped to carry the banner for the March for Women&#x27;s Equality / Women&#x27;s Lives, which drew 600,000 marchers to Washington in support of abortion rights and the ERA.

The membership of NOW grew from 80,000 to 250,000 during the years of her presidency and its annual budget increased 70 percent, to $10 million. As NOW president, she opposed U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf War, saying Americans should not be fighting for &quot;clan-run monarchies&quot; in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia that denied women&#x27;s rights.

Yard retired in 1991 following a stroke in May of that year.

== Recognition and awards ==
In 1991, she was honored in Paris by the French Alliance of Women for Democratization for her pioneering work in reproductive rights; she had been a leader in the effort to get Paris-based manufacturer Roussel Uclaf to make the so-called &quot;French abortion pill&quot; (the &quot;morning-after pill&quot;, RU-486) available in the United States.

She received the Feminist Majority Foundation&#x27;s lifetime achievement award for &quot;tireless work for women&#x27;s rights, for women and girls in sports, for the Equal Rights Amendment for Women, for civil rights for all Americans, for her championing of the trade union movement, and her devotion to world peace and non-violence.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Yard married Sylvester Garrett in 1938 (d. 1996); the couple had two sons and a daughter. Yard did not take Garrett&#x27;s name upon their marriage, which was unusual for the time. In the late 1980s she lived in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. Following her retirement, Yard lived in Arlington, Virginia.

She died at age 93 at a nursing home in Dormont, a suburb of Pittsburgh, on September 20, 2005.

<doc id="474454" wikidata="Q1849116" url="?curid=474454" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2001">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales, and airplay. In 2001, there were 14 singles that topped the chart, in 52 issue dates. Although 15 singles claimed the top position throughout the year, group Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; is credited in 2000, and is thus excluded.

During the year, 12 acts had achieved a first U.S. number-one single, namely: Shaggy, Ricardo &quot;RikRok&quot; Ducent, OutKast, Mystikal, Crazy Town, Rayvon, Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa, Pink, Alicia Keys, Ja Rule, Mary J. Blige, and Nickelback. Destiny&#x27;s Child, Usher and Shaggy had two number-one singles in 2001.

Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;All for You&quot; is the longest-running single of the year, staying at number one for seven consecutive weeks. 2001 is the first year since 1993 that there has not been at least one number-one hit with a double-digit run. &quot;All for You&quot; is also responsible to give to Jackson the tenth Hot 100 number one of her career; making her the fourth female artist with most number ones in the rock era. Other singles that had a multiple chart run includes Alicia Keys&#x27; &quot;Fallin&#x27;&quot; and Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Family Affair&quot;; both stayed atop for six weeks.

<doc id="474459" wikidata="Q59737" url="?curid=474459" title="Jan Kochanowski">
<text>Jan Kochanowski (; 1530 – 22 August 1584) was a Polish Renaissance poet who wrote in Latin and Polish and established poetic patterns that would become integral to Polish literary language. He has been called the greatest Polish poet before Adam Mickiewicz (the latter, a leading Romantic writer) and one of the most influential Slavic poets prior to the 19th century.

In his youth Kochanowski traveled to Italy, where he studied at the University of Padua, and to France. In 1559 he returned to Poland, where he made the acquaintance of political and religious notables including Jan Tarnowski, Piotr Myszkowski (whom he briefly served as courtier), and members of the influential Radziwiłł family.

From about 1563, Kochanowski served as secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus. He accompanied the King to several noteworthy events, including the (held in Lublin), which enacted the Union of Lublin, formally establishing the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1564 he was made provost of Poznań Cathedral. By the mid-1570s he had largely retired to his estate at Czarnolas. He died suddenly in 1584, while staying in Lublin.

All his life, Kochanowski was a prolific writer. Works of his that are pillars of the include the 1580 (&quot;Laments&quot;), a series of nineteen threnodies (elegies) on the death of his daughter Urszula; the 1578 tragedy (&quot;The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys&quot;), inspired by Homer; and Kochanowski&#x27;s (&quot;Epigrams&quot;), a collection of 294 short poems written during the 1560s and 1570s, published in three volumes in 1584. One of his major stylistic contributions was the adaptation and popularization of Polish-language verse forms.

==Life==
=== Early life (1530–1550s) ===
Details of Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s life are sparse and come primarily from his own writings. He was born in 1530 at Sycyna, near Radom, Kingdom of Poland, to a Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) family of the Korwin coat of arms. His father, , was a judge in the Sandomierz area; his mother, , was of the Odrowąż family. Jan had eleven siblings and was the second son; he was an older brother of Andrzej Kochanowski and , both of whom also became poets and translators.

Little is known of Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s early education. At fourteen, in 1544, he was sent to the Kraków Academy. Later, around 1551-52, he attended the University of Königsberg, in Ducal Prussia (a fiefdom of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland); then, from 1552 to the late 1550s, Padua University in Italy. At Padua, Kochanowski studied classical philology and came in contact with the humanist scholar Francesco Robortello. During his &quot;Padua period&quot;, he traveled back and forth between Italy and Poland at least twice, returning to Poland to secure funding and attend his mother&#x27;s funeral. Kochanowski concluded his fifteen-year period of studies and travels with a visit to France, where he visited Marseilles and Paris and met the poet Pierre de Ronsard. It has been suggested that one of his travel companions in that period was , a future Flemish scholar and poet.

=== Career and royal court (1559–1570s) ===

In 1559 Kochanowski permanently returned to Poland, where he was active as a humanist and a Renaissance poet. He spent the next fifteen years as a courtier, though little is known about his first few years on return to Poland. The period covering the years 1559-1562 is poorly documented. It can be assumed that the poet established closer contacts with the court of Jan Tarnowski, the voivode of Kraków, and the Radziwiłłs. In mid-1563, Jan entered the service of the Vice Chancellor of the Crown and bishop Piotr Myszkowski, thanks to whom he received the title of royal secretary. There are no details concerning the duties performed by Jan at the royal court. On 7 February 1564 Kochanowski was admitted to the provostship in the Poznań cathedral, which Myszkowski had renounced.

Around 1562–63 he was a courtier to Bishop Filip Padniewski and Voivode Jan Firlej. From late 1563 or early 1564, he was affiliated with the royal court of King Sigismund II Augustus, serving as a royal secretary. During that time he received two benefices (incomes from parishes). In 1567 he accompanied the King during an episode of the , itself a part of the Livonian War: a show of force near Radashkovichy. In 1569 he was present at the which enacted the Union of Lublin establishing the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

=== Late life and Czarnolas (1571–1584) ===
From 1571 onward, Kochanowski began to spend more time at a family estate in the village of Czarnolas located near Lublin. In 1574, following the decampment of Poland&#x27;s recently elected King Henry of Valois (whose candidacy to the Polish throne Kochanowski had supported), Kochanowski settled permanently in Czarnolas to lead the life of a country squire. In 1575 he married (daughter of Sejm deputy ), with whom he had seven children. At Czarnolas, following the death of his daughter Ursula, which affected him greatly, he wrote one of his most memorable works, &quot;Treny&quot; (the &quot;Laments&quot;).

In 1576 Kochanowski was a royal envoy to the sejmik (local assembly) in Opatów. Despite the urging of people close to him, including the Polish nobleman and statesman Jan Zamoyski, he decided not to take an active part in the political life of the court. Nonetheless, Kochanowski remained socially active on a local level and was a frequent visitor to Sandomierz, the capital of his voivodeship. On 9 October 1579, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan Batory signed in Vilnius the nomination of Kochanowski as the standard-bearer of Sandomierz.

Kochanowski died, probably of a heart attack, in Lublin on 22 August 1584, aged 54. He was buried in the crypt of a parish church in Zwoleń. According to historical records, at least two tombstones were erected for Kochanowski, one in Zwoleń and another in Policzno, neither of which survives. In 1830 Kochanowski&#x27;s remains were moved to his family crypt by the Zwoleń church authorities. In 1983 they were returned to the church, and in 1984 another funeral was held for the poet.

In 1791 Kochanowski&#x27;s reputed skull had been removed from his tomb by Tadeusz Czacki, who kept it in his estate at Porycko. He later gave it to Izabela Czartoryska; by 1874, it had been transported to the Czartoryski Museum, where it currently resides. However, anthropological studies in 2010 showed it to be the skull of a woman, possibly Kochanowski&#x27;s wife.

==Works==

Kochanowski&#x27;s earliest known work may be the Polish-language &quot;Pieśń o potopie&quot; (&#x27;), possibly composed as early as 1550. His first publication was the 1558 Latin-language &#x27;, an epitaph dedicated to his recently deceased colleague . Kochanowski&#x27;s works from his youthful Padua period comprise mostly elegies, epigrams, and odes.

Upon his return to Poland in 1559, his works generally took the form of epic poetry and included the commemoratives &#x27; (&quot;On the Death of Jan Tarnowski&quot;, 1561) and &#x27; (&quot;Remembrance for the All-Blessed Jan Baptist, Count at Tęczyna,&quot; 1562-64); the more serious &#x27; (1562) and &quot;Proporzec albo hołd pruski&quot; (&#x27;, 1564); the satirical social- and political-commentary poems &quot;Zgoda&quot; (&#x27;, or &quot;Harmony&quot;, ca. 1562) and &quot;Satyr albo Dziki Mąż&quot; (&#x27;, 1564); and the light-hearted &quot;Szachy&quot; (&quot;Chess&quot;, ca. 1562-66). The last, about a game of chess, has been described as the first Polish-language &quot;humorous epic or heroicomic poem&quot;.

Some of his works can be seen as journalistic commentaries, before the advent of journalism &quot;per see&quot;, expressing views of the royal court in the 1560s and 1570s, and aimed at members of parliament (the &quot;Sejm&quot;) and voters. This period also saw most of his &quot;Fraszki&quot; (&quot;Epigrams&quot;), published in 1584 as a three-volume collection of 294 short poems reminiscent of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. They became Kochanowski&#x27;s most popular writings, spawning many imitators in Poland. Czesław Miłosz, 1980 Nobel lureate Polish poet, calls them a sort of &quot;very personal diary, but one where the personality of the author never appears in the foreground&quot;. Another of Kochanowski&#x27;s works from the time is the non-poetic political-commentary dialogue, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Portents&quot;).

A major work from that period was &quot;Odprawa posłów greckich&quot; (&quot;The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys&quot;, written ca. 1565-66 and first published and performed in 1578; translated into English in 2007 by Bill Johnston as &quot;The Envoys&quot;). This was a blank-verse tragedy that recounted an incident, modeled after Homer, leading to the Trojan War. It was the first tragedy written in Polish, and its theme of the responsibilities of statesmanship resonates to this day. The play was performed on 12 January 1578 in Warsaw&#x27;s Ujazdów Castle at the wedding of Jan Zamoyski and Krystyna Radziwiłł (Zamoyski and the Radziwiłł family were among Kochanowski&#x27;s important patrons). Miłosz calls &quot;The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys&quot; &quot;the finest specimen of Polish humanist drama&quot;.

During the 1560s and 1570s, Kochanowski completed a series of elegies titled &quot;Treny&quot;, which were later published in three volumes in 1584 (in English generally titled &quot;Laments&quot; rather than &quot;Threnodies&quot;). The poignant nineteen elegies mourn the loss of his cherished two-and-a-half-year-old daughter . In 1920, the &quot;Laments&quot; were translated into English by Dorothea Prall, and in 1995 by the duo, Stanisław Barańczak and Seamus Heaney. As with Kochanowski&#x27;s &quot;Fraszki&quot;, it became a perennially popular wellspring of a new genre in Polish literature. Milosz writes that &quot;Kochanowski&#x27;s poetic art reached its highest achievements in the &quot;Laments&quot;&quot;: Kochanowski&#x27;s innovation, &quot;something unique in... world literature... a whole cycle... centered around the main theme&quot;, scandalized some contemporaries, as the cycle applied a classic form to a personal sorrow – and that, to an &quot;insignificant&quot; subject, a young child.

In 1579 Kochanowski translated into Polish one of the Psalms, &quot;Psalterz Dawidów&quot; (David&#x27;s Psalter). By the mid-18th century, at least 25 editions had been published. Set to music, it became an enduring element of Polish church masses and popular culture. It also became one of the poet&#x27;s more influential works internationally, translated into Russian by Symeon of Polotsk and into Romanian, German, Lithuanian, Czech, and Slovak. His &quot;Pieśni&quot; (&quot;&quot;), written over his lifetime and published posthumously in 1586, reflect Italian lyricism and &quot;his attachment to antiquity&quot;, in particular to Horace, and have been highly influential for Polish poetry.

Kochanowski also translated into Polish several ancient classical Greek and Roman works, such as the &quot;Phenomena&quot; of Aratus and fragments of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Illiad&quot;. Kochanowski&#x27;s notable Latin works include &#x27; (&quot;Little Book of Lyrics&quot;, 1580), &#x27; (&quot;Four Books of Elegies&quot;, 1584), and numerous occasional poems. His Latin poems were translated into Polish in 1829 by Kazimierz Brodziński, and in 1851 by Władysław Syrokomla.

In some of his works, Kochanowski used Polish alexandrines, wherein each line comprises thirteen syllables, with a caesura following the seventh syllable. Among works published posthumously, the historical treatise &quot;&quot; (&quot;Woven Story of Czech and Lech&quot;) offered the first critical literary analysis of Slavic myths, focusing on the titular origin myth about Lech, Czech, and Rus&#x27;.

From May 2024, the only copy of a work by Jan Kochanowski in the author&#x27;s hand, the poem &quot;Dryas Zamchana&quot;, is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

== Views ==
Like many persons of his time he was deeply religious, and a number of his works are inspired by religion. However, he avoided taking sides in the strife between the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations; he stayed on friendly terms with figures of both Christian currents, and his poetry was viewed as acceptable by both.

== Influence ==

Kochanowski has been described as the greatest Polish poet prior to Adam Mickiewicz. The Polish literary historian writes that Kochanowski is generally regarded as the foremost Renaissance poet not only in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth but across all Slavic nations. His primacy remained unchallenged until the advent of the 19th-century Polish Romantics (aka Polish Messianists), especially Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki, and Alexander Pushkin in Russia.

According to Ulewicz, Kochanowski both created modern Polish poetry and introduced it to Europe. An American Slavicist, , holds that Kochanowski was &quot;the first Slavic author to attain excellence on a European scale&quot;. Similarly Miłosz writes that &quot;until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the most eminent Slavic poet was undoubtedly Jan Kochanowski&quot; and that he &quot;set the pace for the whole subsequent development of Polish poetry&quot;. The British historian Norman Davies names Kochanowski the second most important figure of the Polish Renaissance, after Copernicus. Polish poet and literary critic Jerzy Jarniewicz called Kochanowski &quot;the founding father of Polish literature&quot;.

Kochanowski never ceased writing in Latin. One of his major achievements was the creation of Polish-language verse forms that made him a classic for his contemporaries and posterity. He greatly enriched Polish poetry by naturalizing foreign poetic forms, which he knew how to imbue with a national spirit. Kochanowski, writes Davies, can be seen as &quot;the founder of Polish vernacular poetry [who] showed the Poles the beauty of their language&quot;.

American historian Larry Wolf argues that Kochanowski &quot;contributed to the creation of a vernacular culture in the Polish language&quot;; Polish literary historian describes him as &quot;the &#x27;founding father&#x27; of elegant humanist Polish-language poetry&quot;; and American Slavicist and translator David Welsh writes that Kochanowski&#x27;s greatest achievement was his &quot;transformation of the Polish language as a medium for poetry&quot;. Ulewicz credits Kochanowski&#x27;s &quot;Songs&quot; as most influential in this regard, while Davies writes that &quot;Kochanowski&#x27;s Psalter did for Polish what Luther&#x27;s Bible did for German&quot;. Kochanowski&#x27;s works also influenced the development of Lithuanian literature.

== Legacy ==

Kochanowski&#x27;s first published collection of poems was his &quot;David&#x27;s Psalter&quot; (printed 1579). A number of his works were published posthumously, first in a series of volumes in Kraków in 1584–90, ending with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Fragments, or Remaining Writings&quot;). That series included works from his Padua period and his &quot;Fraszki&quot; (Epigrams). 1884 saw a jubilee volume published in Warsaw.

In 1875 many of Kochanowski&#x27;s poems were translated into German by H. Nitschmann. In 1894 &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; called Kochanowski &quot;the prince of Polish poets&quot;. He was, however, long little known outside Slavic-language countries. The first English-language collection of Kochanowski&#x27;s poems was released in 1928 (translations by George R. Noyes et al.), and the first English-language monograph devoted to him, by David Welsh, appeared in 1974. As late as the early 1980s, Kochanowki&#x27;s writings were generally passed over or given short shrift in English-language reference works. However, more recently further English translations have appeared, including &quot;The Laments&quot;, translated by Stanisław Barańczak and Seamus Heaney (1995), and &quot;The Envoys&quot;, translated by Bill Johnston (2007).

Kochanowski&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; has inspired modern Polish literary, musical, and visual art. Fragments of Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s poetry were also used by Jan Ursyn Niemcewicz in the libretto for the opera &quot;Jan Kochanowski&quot;, staged in Warsaw in 1817. In the 19th century, musical arrangements of &quot;Lamentations&quot; and the &quot;Psalter&quot; gained popularity. Stanisław Moniuszko wrote songs for bass with piano accompaniment to the texts of &quot;Lamentations III&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;VI&quot; and &quot;X&quot;. In 1862, the Polish history painter Jan Matejko depicted him in the painting &quot;&quot; (&quot;Jan Kochanowski and his Deceased Daughter Ursula&quot;). In 1961 a museum (the ) opened on Kochanowski&#x27;s estate at Czarnolas.

<text>Austin Creek State Recreation Area is a state park unit of California, United States, encompassing an isolated wilderness area. It is located in Sonoma County, California, adjacent to Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve, with which it shares a common entrance. Its rugged topography includes ravines, grassy hillsides, oak-capped knolls, and rocky summits offering glimpses of the Pacific Ocean. There are of trails, panoramic wilderness views, and camping (both back-country and vehicle-accessible). The remains of Pond Farm artists&#x27; colony (dating from the 1940s) are also included in the Austin Creek SRA.

==Ecology==
Elevations in Austin Creek SRA range from , giving rise to a variety of habitats, including riparian area, chaparral, and woodlands of conifers and oaks. The area&#x27;s 
include open woodlands, rolling hills, and meadows which contrast sharply with dense redwood forests below.

Wildflowers of the area include Douglas irises, Indian paintbrushes, buttercups, lupins, cluster-lilies, California poppies and shooting stars. Trout, salmon, newts and salamanders inhabit the area&#x27;s streams, and Bullfrog Pond hosts sunfish, black bass, and bullfrogs. Birds such as wild turkeys, wood ducks, spotted owls, great blue herons, ravens, white-tailed kites, California quail, woodpeckers, hawks, and tyrant-flycatchers are seen there. Native mammals include squirrels, deer, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, skunks, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions. Feral pigs have also been reported.

==Proposed for closure==
Austin Creek State Recreation Area was one of 70 California state parks proposed for closure in July 2012 as part of a deficit reduction program. It was previously one of 48 state parks threatened with closure in 2008 by California&#x27;s Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger

In September 2012, California State Parks gave Stewards of the Coast and Redwoods, a non-profit, permission to run the recreation area.

<doc id="474466" wikidata="Q2168676" url="?curid=474466" title="Red Tornado">
<text>Red Tornado is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. As the second character to assume the identity of [[Red Tornado (character)|Red Tornado]], he is the result of an android being merged with a sentient tornado by T.O. Morrow.

Red Tornado appears in the TV series &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Iddo Goldberg. Additionally, Corey Burton, Jeff Bennett, and Jason J. Lewis have voiced the character in animation.

==Creation==
Fox was interviewed about the character&#x27;s creation stating, &quot;The Red Tornado was a takeoff on a character (Ma Hunkel) from way back in the early &#x27;40s but she was a woman and we thought we&#x27;d bring a new version of the character in to get a new angle on a plot. I am certain that this idea was Julie&#x27;s.&quot;

==Publication history==
Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dick Dillin, the sentient android Red Tornado first appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #64 (August 1968). The Red Tornado name had previously been used for comical superheroine Ma Hunkel, who was introduced in &quot;All-American Comics&quot; in 1939 as a supporting character in &quot;Scribbly the Boy Cartoonist&quot;. She started using the Red Tornado name in 1940.

The 1968 Red Tornado was a sentient android able to generate tornado-speed winds enabling it to fly and perform other wind-related feats. Originally a member of the Justice Society of America, it moved to another dimension and joined the Justice League of America. Red Tornado&#x27;s body was characteristically damaged or destroyed. It was retconned in 1981, briefly programmed with Ma Hunkel&#x27;s memory (rather than being sentient) until an older alien supervillain (the Tornado Champion) inhabits the android body. In a 1984 retcon, the Tornado Champion never inhabited the android body. Instead, elemental air occupied the android. A 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, The New 52, eliminated Red Tornado from DC Comics (although other characters have hinted at its existence).

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age Red Tornado===
====Ulthoon, the Tornado Tyrant, and the Tornado Champion====
Red Tornado was formed with the merger of two entities: an android body created by supervillain T. O. Morrow and the Tornado Champion from the planet Rann. The Tornado Champion was the morally good part of a sentient tornado on Rann. Known as Ulthoon, the Tornado Tyrant of Rann, this being was defeated by Adam Strange and &quot;contemplated the nature of good and evil and decided that good was the superior force&quot;. Ulthoon is aware of Strange&#x27;s adventure with the Justice League of America (JLA), and in a 1963 story decides to move to an uninhabited replica of Earth. Ulthoon takes on the form of the Justice League. Its evil side, later known as the Tornado Tyrant, emerges and defeats Ulthoon-Justice League. Determined to understand its failure, the Tornado Champion goes to Earth (where the Tornado Tyrant emerges again and defeats the real Justice League). In a second attack, the Justice League banishes the Tornado Tyrant to an &quot;anti-matter universe&quot; and (they believe) is destroyed. The Tornado Champion ends his experiment with a duplicate Earth and JLA, and decides to continue being a hero. This story is retconned in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #193, where the Tornado Champion tells JLA member Firestorm that it alone traveled to Earth in 1963 to &quot;recreate&quot; its failed battle against the Tornado Tyrant. After learning how to defeat its evil half it returned to the replica Earth, defeated its evil half and banished it &quot;forever&quot;.

The next step in Red Tornado&#x27;s evolution came in summer 1968, although the story was not published until 1981. The Tornado Champion, seeking an Earth where no one recognizes it, goes to the alternate dimension known in the DC Comics universe as Earth-Two. It encounters T.O. Morrow, a supervillain from Earth-One who is creating an android to use against the Justice Society of America. Morrow, attempting to dupe the JSA, gives the android Ma Hunkel&#x27;s memory. The Tornado Champion enters the android&#x27;s body, causing a short circuit in Morrow&#x27;s computer which erases its memory.

====Justice Society of America adventures====
In 1968, Red Tornado appears at JSA headquarters on Earth-Two claiming to be the &quot;original&quot; Red Tornado. Although the JSA is suspicious, Red Tornado has all of Hunkel&#x27;s memories. Morrow has other robots attack a museum and vaporize relics, and the JSA responds. Red Tornado, programmed to appear inept (and keep the JSA from realizing its true nature), exposes the JSA to the dust created by the vaporization and all except Doctor Fate fall into a coma. It then returns to Morrow&#x27;s lair as programmed. Morrow&#x27;s computer predicts that keeping Red Tornado active will allow Morrow to continue his criminal activity. Doctor Fate awakens the remaining JSA members from their coma, and Red Tornado betrays his fellow JSA members by telling them to use Morrow&#x27;s energy weapons. The devices, rigged to explode, put the JSA and Red Tornado into a coma and Morrow returns to Earth-One to attack the Justice League. He puts the JLA into comas twice: once with energy duplicates and a second time with energy duplicates of their deadliest enemies. Red Tornado (who was not incapacitated by the energy backfire on Earth-Two) travels to Earth-One and revives the JLA members, who capture Morrow. It returns to Earth-Two and revives the JSA, which admits Red Tornado to full membership in gratitude.

With no Justice Society comic book published at the time, Red Tornado&#x27;s appearances were limited to JSA-JLA collaborations. These were popular, and DC Comics usually published one a year. Red Tornado appeared again in 1969, traveling alone to Earth-One with a warning. The JLA ignores him as they battle a gang and try to save Hawkman, who has been turned into a pillar of salt. As the JLA battles the demons responsible, Red Tornado (investigating where they came from) unleashes a gas which restores Hawkman. It then delivers its message: Aquarius, a &quot;living star&quot;, has wiped out the Earth-Two universe. Two weeks earlier, Doctor Fate protected the JSA and Black Canary&#x27;s husband (police detective Larry Lance) in a magic bubble. The JLA rush into the Earth-Two universe and finding themselves in Doctor Fate&#x27;s bubble. Aquarius forces the mind-controlled JSA to do battle against the JLA, but his hold over them is broken when Larry Lance sacrifices himself to save Black Canary. The JLA tricks Aquarius into entering an antimatter universe, where he is destroyed.

In the next JLA-JSA collaboration, Red Tornado is captured by an alien known as Creator2. Creator2, who wants to merge Earth-One and Earth-Two into a paradise, uses Red Tornado (who has been in both dimensions) to &quot;anchor&quot; this effort. Creator2&#x27;s servants incapacitate several JSA members, but the dimensions are already merging and several JLA members are rendered comatose. The Earth-One Green Lantern and the Atom realize that Red Tornado is controlled by Creator2. With the help of Spectre (not a JSA member), Doctor Fate, Johnny Thunder and Thunderbolt free Red Tornado and end the threat (although Spectre is presumed dead).

Red Tornado has a final mission with the JSA in 1972. The JLA is being visited by Elongated Man, Metamorpho, Zatanna and Wonder Woman when the JSA calls for help. The JLA discovers that Nebula Man has created a planet-sized magic metal fist which is crushing Earth-Two. The heroes contact Oracle, a super-being with vast knowledge, who tells them that only the Seven Soldiers of Victory (SSV) can defeat Nebula Man. However, he scattered them through time and the JSA and JLA begin rescuing them. An old SSV opponent, Iron Hand (also known as The Hand), is behind Nebula Man&#x27;s attack. When the last of the Seven Soldiers is retrieved, the JSA and JLA learn that Wing (the Crimson Avenger&#x27;s sidekick) died saving the SSV from Nebula Man with a secret weapon. JLA&#x27;s Wonder Woman defeats Iron Hand, but the device controlling Nebula Man is smashed and he cannot prevent Earth-Two&#x27;s destruction. After the SSV recreate their weapon, Red Tornado takes the device into orbit; it detonates, killing him.

====Early Justice League of America adventures====
Red Tornado makes his first appearance on Earth-One in April 1973, a year after the character&#x27;s apparent death. Elongated Man joins the JLA and leads the league in investigating a group of pliable, putty-like men who are assembling a super-weapon. Several JLA members are saved by a mysterious individual who turns out to be Red Tornado. Red Tornado did not die in the explosion, but was hurled into the Earth-One dimension. His face was damaged, and his memory temporarily lost. He believes that a blind hermit remolded his face (which penciller Dick Dillin made more human-like), regained his memories after several months. He cannot return to the Earth-Two universe. The &quot;blind hermit&quot; turns out to be T.O. Morrow, who has implanted a device in Red Tornado which will kill the JLA when Red Tornado first uses his JLA signaling device. The JLA discovers the plot and deactivates the device, and Morrow (who can only exist in the absence of Red Tornado) fades away. Red Tornado tries to return to Earth-Two by stowing away in the JLA&#x27;s Trans-Matter Cube (which allows interdimensional travel), but his presence causes the JLA and JSA to go to Earth X: a world in which Nazi Germany won World War II. The two superhero teams meet a third: the Freedom Fighters. Learning that Nazi Germany rules the world with mind-control devices, they destroy one. Three more devices are located and destroyed, but a fourth cannot be found. As the JSA and JLA come under Nazi control and begin to attack the Freedom Fighters, Red Tornado (immune to the device&#x27;s effects) finds and destroys the fourth device.

During the next few years, Red Tornado has a number of adventures with the Justice League; many end with the character damaged or destroyed. In February 1974, Red Tornado accidentally frees alien supervillain Eclipso from imprisonment inside Bruce Gordon and is damaged in the following explosion. In &quot;The Man Who Murdered Santa Claus!&quot;, the JLA&#x27;s old nemesis The Key threatens to destroy St. Louis, Missouri. The JLA must run a gauntlet of traps to reach his bomb; although Red Tornado is apparently killed in one of the snares, the Phantom Stranger saves him. As a Christmas gift, the JLA gives Red Tornado a new, more colorful costume. He is again severely damaged when the Adaptoids mistake the JLA for tyrants.

Red Tornado is apparently killed again in 1976, when Nekron gives the JLA an extreme fear of death which causes it to disband. Nekron then threatens to destroy Midway City with a solar flare, ordering Hawkman (one of the league&#x27;s weakest members) to try to halt the flare. Red Tornado (disguised as Hawkman) is destroyed stopping the flare, giving the real Hawkman and Wonder Woman—who is immune to Nekron&#x27;s fear-inducing power—time to evacuate the city, and Nekron is defeated with an overdose of intense fear.

On Earth-One Red Tornado slowly becomes more human-like, develops a distinct personality and adopts the name John Smith. He becomes a teacher, meeting (and becoming fond of) employment counselor Kathy Sutton.

====Construct====
A Justice League villain composed of radio and other electromagnetic waves, Construct, appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; comic books in 1977. At the beginning of the first story involving Construct, he is apparently defeated by the Atom. Construct remains alive, however, and takes up residence in the Injustice Gang satellite. Although it reforms the Injustice Gang, the JLA defeats them and destroys the satellite but is unaware that Construct controlled the supervillains.

Red Tornado reappears at the end of &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #145, apparently brought back to life with Hawkman and Superman by the death of Count Crystal. When tested by Superman, however, Red Tornado attacks his comrades. When the Injustice Gang satellite blows up, Construct flees into the nearest android body: the orbiting remains of Red Tornado. Defeated by Hawkman and Hawkgirl, Construct leaves Red Tornado&#x27;s body. Reassembled, Red Tornado revives and rejoins the Justice League. Although most JLA members think he is still under Construct&#x27;s control, Black Canary, Hawkgirl and Wonder Woman support him. Red Tornado confronts Construct, and while they are locked in a battle of wills Wonder Woman activates Amazonian technology which disrupts Construct.

Construct becomes Red Tornado&#x27;s nemesis, playing a major role in a 2005 story by helping the Justice League rout the Weaponers of Qward, the Earth-devouring Void Hound and the Crime Syndicate of America. A portion of Construct (merged with the Void Hound) helped save Enigma, reincarnate Engima&#x27;s daughter and help the antihero fight the Crime Syndicate of America.

====Later Justice League adventures====
Red Tornado helps the JLA defeat the Star-Tsar. Former Manhunter Mark Shaw adopts a new heroic identity, the pirate-themed Privateer. Doctor Light defeats the JLA, but the Star-Tsar frees the League because he sees Light as a competitor. Snapper Carr is revealed as the Star-Tsar, supported by JLA foe the Key. The Key, defeated, has a physical deformity eliminating him as the Star-Tsar. Red Tornado uses his robotic memory to demonstrate that Shaw went missing during crucial moments of the adventure, and Shaw is unmasked as the Star-Tsar.

Red Tornado meets his future adopted daughter, Traya, in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #152 (March 1978) after she finds a powerful alien orb and gains super-powers. He and Phantom Stranger save the JLA from oceanic gods in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #157 (August 1978). Red Tornado assists new JLA member Zatanna in locating her mother, Sindella, in the multi-issue &quot;Homo magi&quot; storyline in 1979 (when he is seriously injured). While recovering, he is attacked by the Secret Society of Super-Villains and defeated twice: once by the villains themselves and again by the villains whose minds are those of other JLA members. Red Tornado is tried at the World Court for human-rights violations by Ultraa, who is manipulated by the alien known as the Over-Complex; Ultraa ends the trial when he learns he is being duped.

In &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #7 (March 1979), Red Tornado saves the world from the Weaponers of Qward. The Qwardians capture Superman and take him to Qward, where they intend to use his Kryptonian body as a lens to concentrate Q-rays and immobilize Earth&#x27;s inhabitants before invading the planet. Red Tornado, immune because of his android nature, traces the Q-rays to their source in the Qward dimension and frees Superman by concentrating too much Q-energy through the Man of Steel&#x27;s body (closing the rift between the dimensions).

Despite his success in saving Earth, Red Tornado resigns from the League in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #175 (February 1980) after deciding that he is unreliable in combat. He becomes Traya&#x27;s foster father and resumes his relationship with Kathy Sutton. Longtime JLA foe Doctor Destiny escapes from prison and wreaks havoc by materializing people&#x27;s nightmares; Red Tornado defeats his own dream-demon and stops the villain. His confidence restored, he rejoins the League (which again defeats Doctor Destiny). Red Tornado is one of two league members who discover that Starro has returned. Although Starro takes over the minds of millions of people in New York City (including most of the Justice League) with small duplicates of himself, Red Tornado&#x27;s android mind is not affected and he causes a citywide blackout depriving Starro of the energy needed to dominate so many people.

====Tornado Champion====
In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #192 (July 1981), Red Tornado attacks his fellow league members without warning; after severely injuring several, he is destroyed. A second Red Tornado also attacks and is destroyed. The androids were duplicates created by T.O. Morrow, back after his disappearance in JLA #106, who uses a program to summon the real Red Tornado. Morrow developed a device to steal technology from the future, including a supercomputer which taught him how to build a &quot;humaniztron&quot; device to make Red Tornado sentient and capable of destroying the JSA. However, the computer does not predict that Red Tornado would become independent and Morrow is defeated. He flees to Earth-One, where the supercomputer predicts that he will &quot;fade away&quot; in 28 days if the Justice League is not destroyed. When the damaged Red Tornado also crosses dimensions and falls to earth near Morrow&#x27;s hideout, he again tries unsuccessfully to program him to destroy the JLA.

Morrow reveals that the supercomputer wrongfully predicted his death. When Morrow does not die at the end of the 28-day period, the computer uses future technology in an attempt to dematerialize him. Faulty programming divides Morrow into two beings; one (the &quot;original&quot; Morrow) materializes on an alien world, where he discovers a sceptre-like device allowing him to control the planet&#x27;s ecosystem. He kidnapped Atom&#x27;s wife, Jean Loring; the Flash&#x27;s wife, Iris West, and Linda Danvers (Supergirl), transporting them to this world in the hope of luring the Atom and the Flash. Although Morrow defeats Atom and Flash, he had not counted on Supergirl&#x27;s presence and is defeated.

The other Morrow remained on Earth. This version, which Morrow believed was a future version of himself (known as Future Man), was a mutation. He attempted to switch minds and take over Red Tornado&#x27;s body. Red Tornado reversed the switch, and Future Man died of his mutations.
After Future Man&#x27;s death the original Morrow escaped from prison, consulted his supercomputer and learned how he had been split in two. With the computer&#x27;s help, he attempted to determine what flaw had allowed Red Tornado to become independent and concluded that an outside force was responsible.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #193 (August 1981), Aquaman discovers Morrow&#x27;s hideout and is nearly killed when Morrow uses his alien sceptre. Morrow attempts to dissect Red Tornado to discover the outside influence, and releases Tornado Champion-Tornado Tyrant in the android shell. Tornado Tyrant defeats the JLA, except for Firestorm. Tornado Champion tells Firestorm about how he and his alter ego were fused with the Red Tornado android, and Firestorm replaces both sentient beings in the android body. Red Tornado awakens, and only Firestorm knows his true nature. His dual origin is not fully revealed until Morrow recaptures him to learn how he became sentient. When Morrow opens Red Tornado, Tornado Champion and Tornado Tyrant come out of the body. After a battle with the JLA, Red Tornado is reassembled by Firestorm; the Tyrant and the Champion are returned to the android with their memories erased. Later, Firestorm reveals his secret identity to the Justice League and works with Red Tornado to stop Killer Frost after she freezes New York City.

====Final years====
Red Tornado discovers where Larry Lance&#x27;s body has been brought and the secret origin of the Black Canary in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #219 (October 1983) and &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #220 (November 1983), and discovers that he is one of the few heroes who can defeat the power-mimicking supervillain Paragon in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #224 (March 1984). In the aftermath of the Mars-Earth war, Aquaman disbands the Justice League. He reforms it, limiting it to members willing to devote themselves full-time to JLA business; Red Tornado is not among them.

Before the 1985–1986 multi-title crossover storyline &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Red Tornado had his last adventure as John Smith; Construct later faced Red Tornado in his first miniseries. In the limited series Construct takes over the world, brainwashing everyone with energy emissions from electronic objects. Red Tornado tries to resist as much as he can, given that he cannot be brainwashed, and defeats Construct in a virtual world.

====Crisis on Infinite Earths====
Red Tornado makes his final appearances in his original form in the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; mini-series. According to books published by DC Comics, the multiverse was created when alien scientist Krona attempted to meddle with the creation of the universe. An embodiment of the power of the Earth-One universe, the nearly all-powerful Monitor, discovered that an antimatter version (the Anti-Monitor) lived in the antimatter universe. When scientist Kell Mossa (later known as Pariah) destroyed his dimension, the Anti-Monitor became more powerful than the Monitor; this led the Monitor to begin assembling his galaxy&#x27;s greatest heroes and villains to aid his cause. The Monitor&#x27;s assistant, Harbinger, has been possessed by one of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s shadow demons; she kills the Monitor as groups of heroes fan out throughout space and time to stop the advancing antimatter wave from destroying the multiverse.

Red Tornado makes his first appearance in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #4 (July 1985). The Psycho-Pirate has been whisked away from his mission to protect a cosmic tuning fork, and Red Tornado and the Flash are similarly teleported away. The Anti-Monitor has kidnapped them and refashions Red Tornado&#x27;s body into a weapon, telling him that he is more than a machine and even more than a man (which Red Tornado does not understand). Under the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s control, he wreaks destruction on a massive scale across Earth-One and Earth-Two (which have been temporarily saved from destruction) before he is torn apart by a number of heroes. Supergirl seriously injures the Anti-Monitor and destroys the machine which was tearing the remaining universes apart before she dies. Red Tornado again appears in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #8 (November 1985), when Firestorm, Atom, and Blue Devil bring his remains to the Justice League satellite and bring T.O. Morrow there to repair him. A bomb inside Red Tornado goes off, destroying the satellite.

However, Red Tornado is still alive in the satellite&#x27;s wreckage. In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; Annual #3 (August 1985), he links with the still-functioning JLA computer to learn more about himself. A bolt of energy sends the wreckage down to Earth (where the Martian Manhunter finds Red Tornado&#x27;s head), but Red Tornado sends his consciousness into a nearby S.T.A.R. Labs weather-control satellite. Gathering energy to give himself physical form, he uses the satellites to wreak havoc on Earth. The JLA destroys the satellites one by one, eventually freeing the now-corporeal Tornado Champion. Red Tornado tries to contacting Kathy Sutton with several electronic devices. The JLA brings her to Tornado Champion, who says that he now has the power to remake worlds. Kathy convinces him that he needs to be more human to be accepted. Although he seems to believe Kathy, an attack by Superman angers him and he heads off into the universe. The &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; ends when the Spectre confronts the Anti-Monitor at the moment when Krona creates the multiverse; Darkseid and the Earth-Two Superman then destroy the weakened Anti-Monitor.

===Post-Crisis===
====Air elemental====
Although Red Tornado&#x27;s android origin remained almost the same after the Crisis, he was never again the Tornado Champion; he was an air elemental, created by Maya (the spirit of Earth) to protect the environment. Like other elementals such as Swamp Thing, this spirit needed to have a human host. The host was intended to be Professor Ivo&#x27;s infant son, but the boy died at an early age and the elemental went into an android body created by Ivo.

====The Elemental War====
Air pollution has an adverse effect on the Red Tornado-Tornado Champion, driving him half-mad and into conflict with Naiad against Firestorm and the Swamp Thing in &quot;The Elemental War&quot;. Firestorm calms them both, and makes a new body shell for Red Tornado. The new body is imperfect, and he begins to malfunction. His humanity is almost lost as he looks increasingly damaged, dirty and defective. During a period of near-total malfunction, Red Tornado is a member of the Leymen. He experiences jerks and spasms as he moves, sounds from malfunctioning gears and mechanisms emanate from his body and he speaks in a halting, emotionless, mechanical monotone. During his association with the Leymen, the original Red Tornado personality reemerges with his emotions and humanity.

====Young Justice====
Red Tornado spends time, silent and still, in the empty JLA headquarters in Happy Harbor, Rhode Island, feeling isolated from humanity. When Robin, Superboy and Impulse have a sleepover there, Impulse&#x27;s behavior revives Red Tornado and reassures him that he is not as removed from humanity as he had thought, albeit because he realized that all three of them were annoying him.

Regaining his abilities to move and communicate, Red Tornado reestablishes his connections with the Justice League and the superhero community. He advises Young Justice, assisting them on their missions as needed, and is an auxiliary member of the JLA. Red Tornado tries to reconcile with his wife, Kathy Sutton. Although he does not fully succeed, their adopted daughter Traya accepts Red Tornado regardless of his appearance or state of repair. Because of Traya&#x27;s attachment, Kathy allows Red Tornado regular visitation and contact. He does not return to his John Smith identity, but acts as Traya&#x27;s adoptive father in his superheroic-robotic identity, even after a court attempted to deny him access after Kathy was left in a coma and the Tornado was ruled as having no more legal rights than a standard machine, Tornado regaining his legal standing as Traya&#x27;s father when government officials restored his legal authority in return for his help in a crisis (Tornado admitted that he would have helped them regardless, but took the offer as he was practical). Red Tornado also assists with Superman&#x27;s defeat of Brainiac 13; when Brainiac takes control of the robotic heroes until they are shut down by an electromagnetic pulse generated by Lex Luthor in a stolen Kryptonian battlesuit, Kelex reactivates Red Tornado to use his wind manipulation abilities to break Brainiac 13 down into his component nanobots and trap him in Luthor&#x27;s battlesuit.

====Crisis of Conscience====
After DC&#x27;s &quot;Crisis of Conscience&quot; miniseries, Red Tornado is attacked by the surviving members of the original Secret Society of Super Villains and his body is destroyed before the JLA arrives. Batman brings his remains to the Batcave and builds an upgraded, android body. When the League is attacked by Despero, Red Tornado helps defeat him since he is immune to Despero&#x27;s telepathy and mind control.

====&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;52&quot;====
Red Tornado is recruited by Donna Troy to fight the menace in space during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. According to a conversation between Doc Magnus and his creator, T.O. Morrow, in &quot;52&quot;, Red Tornado sacrifices himself during the Crisis. Morrow&#x27;s response to the news is to ask how many times the Tornado has died and he alludes to the Red Inferno, another android he created.

During the fifth week of the &quot;52&quot; event, after the other heroes are beamed back down to Earth at Uluru, the Tornado&#x27;s speaker (embedded in Mal Duncan&#x27;s chest) plays a warning message for his comrades: &quot;It&#x27;s coming! 52! 52!&quot;.

Twelve weeks later, in &quot;52&quot; week 17, Red Tornado (now in pieces) is beamed back down to Earth with the other heroes and overlooked by the search team. Conscious but unable to say anything but &quot;52&quot;, the Tornado is discovered by a group of young aborigines in the Australian outback. At the end of week 21, he is being reassembled with auto parts by an Australian mechanic. Malfunctioning but able to access his psychokinetic powers, in week 28 he is defeated by a group of Intergang enforcers evicting a tribe of aborigines from their shanty town. Disassembled and trashed, his head becomes part of a contemporary art sculpture. T.O. Morrow buys his head, hoping to discover his secrets. As Morrow is used as bait to trap Mister Mind, Red Tornado&#x27;s head falls into Rip Hunter&#x27;s hands and Hunter combines his head with his own Time Bubble to navigate to the restored universe.

====One Year Later====
One Year Later, Red Tornado&#x27;s android body is repaired. Kathy Sutton spends time with it, talking with Platinum, thinking that she has done this seven times before and waiting for John to come back to his body. His soul enters a human body offered by Felix Faust, posing as Deadman. When the Justice League of America calls him back as a member, John Smith returns as a human being. He has the same wind powers as his robotic form, but lacks his android body&#x27;s stamina and resilience.

His android body is stolen from Will Magnus&#x27; lab by Doctor Impossible. Magnus notifies Red Tornado, who leaves to find his stolen android body. Arsenal (later known as Red Arrow), Black Canary and Green Lantern join the search, tracking a beacon planted by Magnus in Red Tornado&#x27;s android body. They track the signal to a remote mountain base and confront Professor Ivo, who has regained his human appearance and releases a swarm of activated Tornado androids against them. After the androids are defeated and Red Tornado arrives, it is revealed that this was orchestrated by a revived, intelligent Solomon Grundy.

Grundy admits masterminding the plan to place Red Tornado in a human shell meant to cripple him and slowly rob him of his health and aerokinesis, although a mishap let Tornado keep his powers in his weakened form. Grundy has Red Tornado android body infused with super-powered objects and one of Ivo&#x27;s Amazo chips, creating an invincible shell to house his soul so he can never die again. The heroes and others pursue the Red Tornado-Amazo android, who (thinking himself John Smith) went to see his family. As they leave, Grundy keeps the now-weak human Red Tornado separate in an attempt to kill him. Tornado, no longer a match for Grundy&#x27;s superhuman strength, is beaten and mutilated. Despite his injuries, however, he summons winds which snap Grundy like a tree.

The Amazo form is slowed down by Apokoliptian technology given to Kathy Sutton by Big Barda (after recent tragedies, the JLA had armed their loved ones), and the heroes neutralize him. Dying, he asks his wife to rebuild the Red Tornado android and allow him to return. Zatanna lifts the spell trapping his soul, allowing Red Tornado to again inhabit his android shell at his &quot;death&quot;. Although he can keep Ivo&#x27;s enhancements, Red Tornado divests himself of all augmentation and joins the Justice League of America with his usual powers. Since returning to his robotic body, Red Tornado has begun behaving oddly, losing control of his powers and nearly killing Red Arrow. He becomes increasingly cold and detached from his friends and family, acting more like a machine than a sentient being.

After the team&#x27;s battle with the Injustice League, Red Tornado&#x27;s body is badly damaged and his consciousness is placed in the Hall of Justice&#x27;s computer system. When his feelings slowly return, he warns that a jump into a new host body could damage his soul; even if Magnus&#x27; new shell mimics a human body, its computational abilities are inferior to his cybernetic mind. However, he accepts the deal for a new chance at life with his family.

The Justice League, calling on Zatanna and John Henry Irons, initiates the transfer. Amazo, still present in Red Tornado&#x27;s previous body of as a dormant program, seizes the self-repairing processes, fights Irons, steals the Magnus shell and battles the league. Zatanna unleashes the only force Amazo cannot mimic: the soul of Red Tornado in its primal, elemental form. Red Tornado is then restored in a spare body, and Kathy agrees to marry him. After helping capture Professor Ivo, Red Tornado takes a leave of absence from the league. In 2009, DC comics announced a Red Tornado miniseries chronicling his origin and revealing an &quot;android family&quot; which may conflict with Tornado, his wife and adopted daughter after &quot;Final Crisis&quot;.

====Blackest Night and Brightest Day====
After the miniseries, Red Tornado is again destroyed in a battle with Black Lantern versions of deceased JLA members Vibe and Steel. When &quot;Blackest Night&quot; ends, the JLA reorganizes. Former Titan Cyborg is among the new members of the League, setting out to rebuild Red Tornado and claiming to be able to make him indestructible. With his new body under construction, Red Tornado&#x27;s severed (but sentient) head is left behind by Cyborg when the team leaves the Watchtower to face down a group of villains on Blackhawk Island. Despite his body being unfinished, Red Tornado rescues Green Arrow from Doctor Impossible.

Cyborg takes a leave of absence from the JLA to finish John&#x27;s new body. With the repairs completed (thanks to self-replicating nanites), he invites Kathy to S.T.A.R. Labs to rejoin her husband. Red Tornado attacks Cyborg, begging his friend to kill him before he hurts someone. Unknown to Cyborg or Red Tornado, his insanity is the result of Alan Scott&#x27;s Starheart power which can give metahumans magical or elemental abilities. Cyborg frees Red Tornado with his matrix. Red Tornado accompanies the JLA in a mission to Hell, where he helps Superman defeat Minos.

===The New 52===
In 2011, DC rebooted its continuity as part of The New 52. During the battle between the Justice League and Atlantis, T.O. Morrow says that his weather machine can take control of the weather from the invading Atlanteans, but Silas Stone rejects the idea because the technology is from another dimension (Earth-Two) and unstable. Morrow later says, &quot;But the Tornado could ...&quot;. An unfinished Red Tornado is seen in the Red Room while Cyborg is being rebuilt after Grid takes his robotic parts. Red Tornado faces the Metal Men.

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Red Tornado returned to the main continuity in the 2017 event &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; being held captive by the Blackhawks.

In &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, Red Tornado is killed by Robin King before Batman resurrects him with a Black Lantern ring.

=== DC All In ===
In &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, Red Tornado is destroyed by Deadeye. His consciousness survives and is transported to the Watchtower, where he becomes a mission coordinator.

==Powers and abilities==
Red Tornado is an android, and his creator, T.O. Morrow, designed him with strength, durability, and thought-processing powers many orders of magnitude greater than a human. In terms of raw physical strength, his artificial body has been depicted moving objects weighing 20 tons under optimal conditions, and his body has survived both the extremes of space and deep-sea pressures. It additionally possesses the ability to self-repair anything less than catastrophic damage. His senses are similarly computerized, allowing him to hear and see events far exceeding human perception; in an extreme example he used his vision to observe Justice League teammates attempting a low orbit rescue of &quot;Challenger&quot; astronauts inside a damaged space shuttle from sea level, though the images were out of focus and at the limit of his range. Red Tornado also frequently monitors wireless communication frequencies for signs of distress, though he has likened this to listening to background chatter in a crowd, remaining indistinct until someone or something draws his attention to it.

As a gestalt entity born of the Tornado Tyrant merging with Morrow&#x27;s programming, he possesses attributes of both natural and artificial intelligence; he is both self-aware and growing intellectually, with feelings and emotions analogous to human consciousness. In comparison to the Metal Men, another group of AI heroes, Kathy Sutton notes that Red Tornado&#x27;s emotional depth and personality were much more sophisticated than theirs since he possessed a sense of humor and ability to appreciate puns. In terms of emotional depth, Red Tornado has been capable of forming and maintaining a romantic relationship with Kathy Sutton, as well as a foster father relationship with Traya. T.O. Morrow noted, with both chagrin and admiration, that Red Tornado&#x27;s processing power was strong enough to both develop free will and promptly reject his programming in favor of becoming a hero; this same spontaneous generation of a rudimentary ethical code became the foundation for his gynoid &#x27;sister&#x27;, Tomorrow Woman&#x27;s transformation into a hero as well, who was similarly programmed by Morrow. With the Justice League, Red Tornado has used his computing power on occasion, though this requires diverting internal resources away from physical and interactive participation, giving the impression of intense &#x27;concentration&#x27;. While his raw computing power exceeds any known supercomputer available to the league, the majority of his internal resources are devoted to autonomic physical functions and his depth of personality. Both his artificial structure and unique combination of complex reasoning and empathy have made him immune to overt telepathic mind control. Even so, he has on occasion been susceptible to malicious coding which has attacked his computerized &#x27;subconscious&#x27; and to standard psychological attacks that target his affections and aspirations.

Unlike the Flash or Superman who can create high speed winds through physical motion (such as running or spinning), Red Tornado is aerokinetic, with the ability to spontaneously and regularly generate wind motion in excess of a Category 5 tropical storm (&quot;Hurricane force&quot;), for winds exceeding 136 knots (157 mph; 252 km/h) over a sustained period. At lower speeds, these enable levitation of people and objects, personal flight, enhanced speed, and limited storm creation. Within his field of control, these gusts take on a light crimson hue, making them perceivable to the naked eye; this effect is inherent with his signature ability and became the iconic basis for his name. Further, this ability is an immutable part of his being and uniquely connected to his &#x27;soul&#x27;; even when transferred into an unused clone of the villain, Multiplex, he retained his aerokinetic abilities and transferred it yet again when reverted to an android body. Regardless of his physical state, his maximum output has never been identified. For example, when under extreme duress and critically injured in a mortal human body, Red Tornado was still able to generate F5 tornado winds exceeding 276 knots (318 mph; 512 km/h), which was powerful enough to snap Solomon Grundy in half. As an android, Red Tornado can generate and maintain his winds at those speeds indefinitely, never tiring physically or mentally from the exertion.

Red Tornado has undergone several major upgrades in his existence, several of which improved his physical form. Most recently, an upgrade infused his body with microscopic nanites, with the ability to alter his appearance and body composition at will.

<text>The pacarana (Dinomys branickii) is a rare and slow-moving hystricognath rodent indigenous to South America. Native Tupi people call it the &quot;pacarana&quot; (false paca) because it is superficially similar to the paca, a different rodent which is not in the same family. The pacarana has a chunky body and is large for a rodent, weighing up to and measuring up to in length, not including the thick, furry tail.

The pacarana is nocturnal and is found only in tropical forests of the western Amazon River basin and adjacent foothills of the Andes Mountains. It ranges from northwestern Venezuela and Colombia to western Bolivia, including the Yungas. It is common in Cotapata National Park in Bolivia.

The pacarana is the sole extant member of the rodent family Dinomyidae in the infraorder Caviomorpha; the paca that it resembles in appearance is in a different Caviomorph family, the Cuniculidae. Initially, the pacarana was regarded as a member of the superfamily Muroidea, that includes the true mice, but that view was abandoned in the face of evidence that suggests that the pacarana is in the family Dinomyidae together with extinct animals such as &quot;Phoberomys pattersoni&quot; and &quot;Josephoartigasia monesi&quot;, prehistoric giant rodents that lived in South America several million years ago.

Pacaranas typically are found in family groups of four or five.

== Characteristics ==
Pacarana have 4 limbs and large heads. They are considered a scansorial species. When they eat, they grasp their food with their fore-paws while sitting on their hind legs.

<doc id="474477" wikidata="Q446406" url="?curid=474477" title="Okie">
<text>An Okie is a person identified with the state of Oklahoma, or their descendants. This connection may be residential, historical or cultural. For most Okies, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Oklahoman. While not an official demographic used or recognized by the United States Census Bureau, Okies, due to various factors, have developed their own distinct culture within larger social groupings both akin to and separate from Midwestern and Southern influences. Included are their own dialect, music, and Indigenous-derived folklore.

In California, the term came to refer to very poor migrants from Oklahoma coming to look for employment. The Dust Bowl and the &quot;Okie&quot; migration of the 1930s brought in over a million migrants, many headed to the farm labor jobs in the Central Valley. A study in the 1990s indicated that about 3.75 million Californians were descendants of this population. By 1950, four million individuals, or one quarter of all persons born in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, or Missouri, lived outside the region, primarily in the West.

Prominent Okies included singer/songwriter Woody Guthrie and country musician Merle Haggard. John Steinbeck wrote about Okies moving west in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1939 novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, which was filmed in 1940 by John Ford.

==Great Depression usage==

In the mid-1930s, during the Dust Bowl era, large numbers of farmers fleeing ecological disaster and the Great Depression migrated from the Great Plains and Southwest regions to California mostly along historic U.S. Route 66. Californians began calling all migrants by that name, even though many newcomers were not actually Oklahomans. The migrants included people from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Colorado and New Mexico, but were all referred to as &quot;Okies&quot; and &quot;Arkies&quot;. More of the migrants were from Oklahoma than any other state, and a total of 15% of the Oklahoma population left for California.

Ben Reddick, a free-lance journalist and later publisher of the &quot;Paso Robles Daily Press,&quot; is credited with first using the term &quot;Oakie,&quot; in the mid-1930s, to identify migrant farm workers. He noticed the &quot;OK&quot; abbreviation (for Oklahoma) on many of the migrants&#x27; license plates and referred to them in his article as &quot;Oakies&quot;. The first known usage was an unpublished private postcard from 1907.

==Living conditions in California during the Great Depression==

Once the Okie families migrated from Oklahoma to California, they often were forced to work on large farms to support their families. Because of the minimal pay, these families were often forced to live on the outskirts of these farms in shanty houses they built themselves. These homes were normally set up in groups called Squatter Camps or Shanty Towns, which were often located near the irrigation ditches which ran along the outskirts of these farms. Indoor plumbing was inaccessible to these migrant workers, and so they were forced to resort to using outhouses. Unfortunately, because of the minimal space allotted to the migrant workers, their outhouses were normally located near the irrigation ditches, and some waste would inevitably runoff into the water. These irrigation ditches provided the Okie families with a water supply. 

Due to this lack of sanitation in these camps, disease ran rampant among the migrant workers and their families. Also contributing to disease was the fact that these Shanty Town homes that the Okie migrant workers lived in had no running water, and because of their minimal pay medical attention was out of the question. However, what native Californians failed to realize at the time was that these Okie migrant farm workers did not always live in the conditions that the Dust Bowl left them in. In fact, often these families had once owned their own farms and had been able to support themselves. This meant that Okie families often had been in a fairly comfortable situation before the circumstances surrounding the Dust Bowl induced their migration.

==Post-Great Depression usage==
Historian James Gregory has explored the long-term impact of the Okies on California society. He notes that in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; novelist John Steinbeck envisioned the migrants becoming active unionists and New Deal agitators demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. When a man named Oliver Carson visited Kern County in the 1930s, he became fascinated with the Okie culture and lifestyle. He travelled back in 1952 to see what the Okies had made of themselves and saw that the difference was astounding. They were not living in roadside encampments anymore or driving run-down cars- they had better living situations and better views on life.

When World War II began, large amounts of money went flooding to California to aid the USA in the war. This was highly helpful for the Okies, as jobs of higher quality opened up in larger numbers and they were able to make their lives better over time. Other Okies saw this and decided they wanted to go to California to make even more money. An oil worker wanted to make enough money to go back to Oklahoma and buy a farm, another family wanted to rent out their farm while they were away to potentially double their earnings. These families that came during the 1940s lived in California&#x27;s biggest cities, Los Angeles, San Diego and various cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Other families who moved to California before had usually moved to the valleys and rural areas.

While many families had plans to leave California after making a good amount of money, they often didn&#x27;t; the children and grandchildren of Okies also seldom returned to Oklahoma or farming, and are now concentrated in California&#x27;s cities and suburbs. Long-term cultural impacts include a commitment to evangelical Protestantism, a love of country music, political conservatism, and strong support for traditional moral and cultural values.

It has been said that some Oklahomans who stayed and lived through the Dust Bowl see the Okie migrants as quitters who fled Oklahoma. Other Oklahoma natives are as proud of their Okies who made good in California as are the Okies themselves – and of the Arkies, West Texans, and others who were cast in with them.

In the later half of the 20th century, there became increasing evidence that any pejorative meaning of the term Okie was fading; former and present Okies began to apply the label as a badge of honor and symbol of the Okie survivor attitude.

In one example, Republican Oklahoma Governor Dewey F. Bartlett launched a campaign in the 1960s to popularize &quot;Okie&quot; as a positive term for Oklahomans; however, the Democrats used the campaign, and the fact that Bartlett was born in Ohio, as a political tool against him, and further degraded the term for some time.

In 1968, Governor Bartlett made Reddick, the originator of the California usage, an honorary Okie. And in the early 1970s, Merle Haggard&#x27;s country song &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; was a hit on national airwaves. During the 1970s, the term Okie became familiar to most Californians as a prototype of a subcultural group.

In the early 1990s the California Department of Transportation refused to allow the name of the &quot;Okie Girl&quot; restaurant to appear on a roadside sign on Interstate 5, arguing that the restaurant&#x27;s name insulted Oklahomans; only after protracted controversy and a letter from the Governor of Oklahoma did the agency relent. Since then, the children and grandchildren of Okies in California changed the meaning of Okie to a self-title of pride in obtaining success, as well to challenge what they felt was snobbery or &quot;the last group to make fun of&quot; in the state&#x27;s urban area cultures.

Muskogee Mayor John Tyler Hammons used the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m proud to be an Okie from Muskogee&quot; as the successful theme of his 2008 mayoral campaign. He was 19 years old at the time. 2020 U.S. Presidential candidate and U.S. Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, who was born in Oklahoma, frequently referenced her &quot;Okie&quot; roots during campaign events.

==In popular culture==

Novels
*John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for its characterization of the Okie lifestyle and journey to California.
*In James Blish&#x27;s &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; science fiction series, the term &quot;Okie&quot; was applied in a similar context to entire cities that, thanks to an anti-gravity device, take flight to the stars in order to escape an economic collapse on Earth. Working as a migrant labor force, these cities act as cultural pollinators, spreading technology and knowledge throughout the expanding human civilization. The later novels focus on the travels of New York City as one such Okie city, though there are many others.
*In the novel &quot;On the Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac – written between 1948 and 1949, although not published until 1957 – the term appears to refer to some of the people the main character, a New York author, meets in one of his trips around the United States.
*In the novel &quot;Paint it Black&quot; by Janet Fitch, the protagonist (an LA punk-rocker in the early 1980s) thinks of herself and her family as &quot;Okies.&quot;
*Frank Bergon&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Jesse&#x27;s Ghost&quot; draws attention to today&#x27;s sons and daughters of the California Okies portrayed in Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.
*Kristin Hannah&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;The Four Winds&quot; portrays the life, struggle and survival of a single mother and her two children during the days following the Great depression (1929) and Dust Bowls. She and people like her are often termed as &quot;Okies&quot; by the Californian natives.
*Sanora Babb&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Whose Names Are Unknown&quot; is based on the author&#x27;s first-hand experience. The novel was originally scheduled to be published in 1939, but publication was shelved when Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; came out. The title is taken from a legal eviction notice.

<doc id="474478" wikidata="Q1755188" url="?curid=474478" title="List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 2000">
<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales, and airplay. There were 18 number-one singles in 2000. The first of these, Santana&#x27;s &quot;Smooth&quot;, spent two weeks at the top in January, concluding a 12-week run that had begun in October 1999.

During the year, 10 acts each achieved a first U.S. number-one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest: Joe, 98 Degrees, Lonestar, The Product G&amp;B, Aaliyah, Vertical Horizon, Matchbox Twenty, NSYNC, Sisqó, and Creed. Destiny&#x27;s Child and Christina Aguilera were the only acts to have earned two number-one singles in this year. There were two collaboration singles that reached number-one on the chart: &quot;Maria Maria&quot; by Santana featuring The Product G&amp;B, and &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot; by Mariah Carey featuring Joe and 98 Degrees. With the latter single, Carey set the record for most consecutive years charting a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 with 11 years from 1990 (beginning with &quot;Vision of Love&quot;) through 2000, and became her 15th number-one single on the chart.

Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s &quot;Independent Women&quot; is the second-longest-running single of 2000, topping the chart for 7 consecutive weeks, with another four consecutive weeks in the 2001 chart year. Santana&#x27;s &quot;Maria Maria&quot; is the longest-running single, staying at number one for 10 straight weeks. Other singles with extended chart run include pop singer Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Music&quot; and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot;, each of which topped the chart for four weeks.

<doc id="474484" wikidata="Q159049" url="?curid=474484" title="Aesculus pavia">
<text>Aesculus pavia, known as red buckeye or firecracker plant (formerly &quot;Pavia rubra&quot;), is a species of deciduous flowering plant. The small tree or shrub is native to the southern and eastern parts of the United States, found from Illinois to Virginia in the north and from Texas to Florida in the south. It is hardy far to the north of its native range, with successful cultivation poleward to Arboretum Mustila in Finland.

It has a number of local names, such as scarlet buckeye, woolly buckeye and firecracker plant.

== Description ==
The red buckeye is a large shrub or small tree. It reaches a height of , often growing in a multi-stemmed form. Its leaves are opposite, and are composed usually of five elliptical serrated leaflets, each long. It bears clusters of attractive dark red tubular flowers in the spring. The flowers are hermaphrodite. The smooth light brown fruits, about or so in diameter, reach maturity in early fall.

The flowers are attractive to hummingbirds as well as bees.

== Varieties ==
There are two varieties:
*&quot;Aesculus pavia&quot; var. &quot;pavia&quot;: typical red buckeye.
*&quot;Aesculus pavia&quot; var. &quot;flavescens&quot;: yellow-flowered red buckeye.

The yellow-flowered variety, var. &quot;flavescens&quot;, is found in higher country in Texas, and hybrids with intermediate flower color occur.

Ornamental cultivars, such as the low-growing &#x27;Humilis&#x27;, have been selected for garden use.

=== Hybrids ===
Red buckeye has hybridized with common horse-chestnut (&quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;) in cultivation, the hybrid being named &quot;Aesculus × carnea&quot;, red horse-chestnut. The hybrid is a medium-sized tree to tall, intermediate between the parent species in most respects, but inheriting the red flower color from &quot;A. pavia&quot;. It is a popular tree in large gardens and parks, most commonly the selected cultivar &#x27;Briotii&#x27;. Hybrids of red buckeye with yellow buckeye (&quot;A. flava&quot;) have also been found, and named &quot;Aesculus × hybrida&quot;.

== Uses ==
The fruits are rich in saponins, which are poisonous to humans, although not particularly dangerous because they are not ingested easily. The seeds are poisonous. The oils can be extracted to make soap, although this is not viable commercially.

<doc id="474492" wikidata="Q2426459" url="?curid=474492" title="Thomas Peel">
<text>Thomas Peel (1793 – 22 December 1865) organised and led a consortium of the first British settlers to Western Australia. He was a leader of the colonial militia that participated in Pinjarra massacre in 1834, which saw 70-80 of the Aboriginal Binjareb people killed.
He was a second cousin of two-times British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Thomas Peel was born in Lancashire, England, the second son of Thomas Peel and his wife Dorothy, &quot;née&quot; Bolton. He was educated at Harrow School and was employed by attorneys.

===Adult life in Australia===
In 1828, he went to London with plans to migrate to New South Wales. However, Peel and three others including an MP, Potter McQueen, formed a consortium to found a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia by sending settlers there with stock and necessary materials. The consortium requested a grant from the British Colonial Office in London of 4,000,000 acres (16,000 km²). The government declined this and offered a grant of 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km²) on certain conditions.

Early in 1829, all the members of the consortium withdrew except Peel. Fresh conditions were made, the final arrangement being that if Peel landed 400 settlers before 1 November 1829, he would receive 250,000 acres (1,000 km²), constituting a block extending to the south east from the south bank of the entire Swan River. If the conditions were fulfilled, Peel would receive further grants. Solomon Levey was a silent partner.

To deliver the 400 settlers Peel chartered three vessels, , , and . &quot;Gilmore&quot;, the first to leave, sailed from St Katherine Docks in July 1829 with Thomas Peel and 182 settlers in all.

&quot;Gilmore&quot; arrived in the Swan River Colony (later expanded and renamed Western Australia) on 15 December, around six weeks later than the government had stipulated. As he had not fulfilled the conditions, the agreed land was no longer reserved for him. On arrival, his settlers established a base ln the beach near Woodman&#x27;s Point, 13 miles from Fremantle, which Peel called Clarence, after the Duke of Clarence, the heir apparent. Stores and stock, which were to be sent from Sydney by Cooper &amp; Levey did not arrive.

&quot;Hooghly&quot; (173 passengers), arrived at Clarence on 13 February 1830. &quot;Rockingham&quot; (180 passengers), arrived in mid-May 1830. She was wrecked shortly after landing her passengers, but all survived, though supplies were lost.

The settlers stayed at Clarence about a year and then built boats to enable them to go to Perth.

The land eventually granted to him, 250,000 acres (1,000 km²), extended from Cockburn Sound to the Murray River. This settlement, referred to as the Peel Estate, struggled due to lack of labour and limited good-quality farming land. One of the things he tried on the coast was whaling. Peel&#x27;s poor organising skills, meant that he was soon in difficulties. Within less than two years, he had spent between £20,000 and £50,000 and most of his settlers deserted him. Eventually Peel discharged all but a few from their indentures. In September 1834, Peel was granted further land, but he had little success in developing it. Peel became a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council, but resigned fourteen months later. Some other pioneers (like James Henty) moved to Tasmania and the Port Phillip district.

Peel died on 22 December 1865 at age 72. He was buried in the churchyard in Mandurah.

=== Pinjarra massacre ===

In October 1834, Peel was a part of the British colonial militia, which included Governor James Stirling and John Septimus Roe, involved in the Pinjarra Massacre. It resulted in the murder of 70 to 80 Binjareb people. Peel participated so that he could attract settlers to his land at Mandurah and to take revenge for the killing of his servant Hugh Nesbitt. In later years, he pejoratively described the local Binjareb people as a &quot;nest of hornets&quot;.

In 2017, a campaign was started to rename the Peel region because of its ties to Peel, in part as a means to come to terms with the past. The MLA for Murray-Wellington Robyn Clarke supported the project but Premier Mark McGowan dismissed the idea of a renaming.

==Legacy and cultural references==
Karl Marx referred to Peel in his analysis of capitalism, in a passage where he criticised colonist Edward Gibbon Wakefield:
Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of £50,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3000[sic] persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, &quot;Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.&quot; Unhappy Mr. Peel who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!

<doc id="474494" wikidata="Q5140049" url="?curid=474494" title="Code Red II">
<text>Code Red II is a computer worm similar to the Code Red worm. Released two weeks after Code Red on August 4, 2001, it is similar in behavior to the original, but analysis showed it to be a new worm instead of a variant. Unlike the first, the second has no function for attack; instead it has a backdoor that allows attacks. The worm was designed to exploit a security hole in the indexing software included as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Information Server (IIS) web server software (CVE-2001-0500).

A typical signature of the Code Red II worm appears in a web server log as:

 GET /default.ida?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 %u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801
 %u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u9090%u8190%u00c3
 %u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a HTTP/1.0

While the original worm tried to infect other computers at random, Code Red II tries to infect machines on the same subnet as the infected machine.

Microsoft had released a security patch for IIS on June 18, 2001, that fixed the security hole, however not everyone had patched their servers, including Microsoft themselves.

<text>Severo-Kurilsk (; , &quot;Kashiwabara&quot;) is a town and the administrative center of Severo-Kurilsky District of Sakhalin Oblast, Russia, located in the northern part of the Kuril Islands, on the island of Paramushir. Population: 

==History==
The Ainu are the original inhabitants of Paramushir, which came under the control of the Russian Empire in the mid-18th century. Russian sovereignty was initially confirmed under the terms of the Treaty of Shimoda in 1855, but the island was transferred to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1875. The Japanese established a settlement, Kashiwabara, on the site of the largest Ainu village (Ottomai), which became the major port on the island, and a center for the commercial fishing industry, particularly for herring. The village was named for the captain of the survey vessel &quot;Iwaki&quot;, which charted the coasts of the island in 1875. The village had the northernmost post office in Japan. During World War II Kashiwabara was strongly garrisoned by the Imperial Japanese Army and served as the headquarters of the IJA 91st Infantry Division. Kashiwabara Airfield was established in the outskirts of the village, and numerous fortifications and gun emplacements were built. The area was subject to sporadic air raids from the US Army Air Force and US Navy based in the Aleutian Islands from 1943 until the end of the war.

During the Invasion of the Kuril Islands, Soviet forces landed on Paramushir on August 18, 1945, and combat operations continued through August 23, ending with the surrender of the surviving members of the Japanese garrison. The Soviets forcibly deported the remaining Japanese civilian inhabitants and sent the prisoners of war to labor camps. Kashiwabara was renamed Severo-Kurilsk (&quot;Northern Kuril Town&quot;) and the island annexed by the Soviet Union in 1946.

On November 5, 1952 the town was completely destroyed by the 1952 Severo-Kurilsk tsunami, with at least 2,336 of the town&#x27;s 6,000 inhabitants killed. Severo-Kurilsk was rebuilt on higher ground, and the population soon rose above its original level, however in the years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the associated economic crisis of the 1990s, the town&#x27;s population has again declined.

The surrounding area has some remaining Japanese fortifications visible. On 25 March 2020, an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck near the town of Severo-Kurilsk.

==Gallery==
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Severo-Kurilsk serves as the administrative center of Severo-Kurilsky District and is subordinated to it. As a municipal division, the town of Severo-Kurilsk and one rural locality of Severo-Kurilsky District are incorporated as Severo-Kurilsky Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Commercial fishing is virtually the only industry in the town.

==Climate==
Severo-Kurilsk has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;). The monthly average temperature is greater than 10 degrees Celsius only in August and September. Due to the influence of the cold current of the Oyashio current, it is cold and humid all year round. Severo-Kurilsk is above the 0°C isotherm and has very rarely, sporadic permafrost during the winter. Despite its northern latitude, temperatures are extremely mild as the ocean regulates the temperature. The annual precipitation is more than five times that of Siberia. Winter lasts from December through April, the months where temperatures average below freezing. The summers are short, cold, and mostly cloudy. Winters are long, freezing, snowy, extremely windy, and overcast. During the winter season, Snow is extremely common and can be found blanketing the ground. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from -6.4°C to 15.2°C and is rarely below -15°C or above 22°C.

Based on the tourism score, the best time of year to visit Severo-Kurilsk for warm-weather activities is for the entire month of August.
