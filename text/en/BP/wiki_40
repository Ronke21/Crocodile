<text>Randolph School is an American independent private Pre-K-through-12th-grade college preparatory school chartered in 1959 in Huntsville, Madison County, Alabama. It started in a home on Randolph Avenue in downtown Huntsville with a handful of elementary classes. A few years later it moved to a much larger campus on Drake Avenue, where it is now located, gradually adding grade levels until having a graduating high school class in the early 1970s.

In 1998, the school purchased of land on Garth Road, less than from the Drake Avenue campus. The new high school opened for the 2009–2010 school year. For the fine arts, the new facilities include a new theater with stadium seating, a workshop for stagecraft, band and choral rooms, and new restroom facilities. In total, Randolph has two gymnasiums, four tennis courts, two practice fields and professionally maintained fields for football, baseball, softball and soccer.

==Athletics==
Randolph School athletic teams have won 51 AHSAA state titles and finished as runners up 51 times. Randolph athletes have also taken home 24 individuals state titles. Most varsity teams currently compete in the AHSAA 4A division. The Randolph boys have won the Cross Country State Championships in 1982, as well as 2005–2013, setting a new state record for most consecutive state championship wins in Alabama with 9. They were runners up in 2014 and 2018. The girls Cross Country team won in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1996, and 1998, and were runners-up in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

<doc id="474123" wikidata="Q1500510" url="?curid=474123" title="The Incredible String Band">
<text>The Incredible String Band (sometimes abbreviated as ISB) were a British psychedelic folk band formed by Clive Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron in Edinburgh in 1966. Following Palmer&#x27;s early departure, Williamson and Heron continued as a duo and were eventually augmented by other musicians such as Licorice McKechnie, Rose Simpson, and Malcolm Le Maistre. The band split up in 1974. They reformed in 1999 and continued to perform with changing lineups until 2006.

The band built a considerable following in the British 1960s counterculture, notably with their albums &quot;The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion&quot; (1967), &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot; (1968), and &quot;Wee Tam and the Big Huge&quot; (1968). They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music.

==History==

===Formation as a trio: 1965–66===
In 1963, acoustic musicians Robin Williamson and Clive Palmer began performing together as a traditional folk duo in Edinburgh, particularly at a weekly club run by Archie Fisher in the Crown Bar which also regularly featured Bert Jansch. There they were seen in August 1965 by Joe Boyd, then working as a talent scout for the influential folk-based label Elektra Records. Later in the year, the duo decided to fill out their sound by adding a third member, initially to play rhythm guitar. After an audition, local rock musician Mike Heron won the slot. The trio took the name &quot;the Incredible String Band&quot;. Early in 1966, Palmer began running an all-night folk club, Clive&#x27;s Incredible Folk Club, on the fourth floor of a building in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow, where they became the house band. When Boyd returned in his new role as head of Elektra&#x27;s London office, he signed them up for an album, beating off a rival bid from Transatlantic Records.

They recorded their first album, entitled &quot;The Incredible String Band&quot;, at the Sound Techniques studio in London in May 1966. It was released in Britain and the United States and consisted mostly of self-penned material in solo, duo and trio formats, showcasing their playing on a variety of instruments. It won the title of &quot;Folk Album of the Year&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s annual poll, and in a 1968 &quot;Sing Out!&quot; magazine interview Bob Dylan praised the album&#x27;s &quot;October Song&quot; as one of his favourite songs of that period, stating it was &quot;quite good&quot;.

The trio broke up after recording the album. Palmer left via the hippie trail for Afghanistan and India, and Williamson and his girlfriend Licorice McKechnie went to Morocco with no firm plans to return. Heron stayed in Edinburgh, playing with a band called Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats. However, when Williamson returned after running out of money, laden with Moroccan instruments (including a gimbri, which was much later eaten by rats), he and Heron reformed the band as a duo.

===Development as a duo: 1966–67===

In November 1966 Heron and Williamson embarked on a short UK tour, supporting Tom Paxton and Judy Collins. In early 1967, they performed regularly at London clubs, including Les Cousins. Joe Boyd became the group&#x27;s manager as well as producer and secured a place for them at the Newport Folk Festival, on a bill with Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen.

The duo were always credited as separate writers, maintaining their individual creative identities, rather than working as a writing partnership. Boyd wrote, &quot;Mike and Robin were Clive&#x27;s friends rather than each other&#x27;s. Without him as a buffer, they developed a robust dislike for one another. Fortunately, the quality and quantity of their songwriting was roughly equal. Neither would agree to the inclusion of a new song by the other unless he could impose himself on it by arranging the instruments and working out all the harmonies.&quot;

In July, they released their second album, &quot;The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion&quot;, accompanied by Pentangle&#x27;s Danny Thompson on double bass and Licorice on vocals and percussion. The album demonstrated considerable musical development and a more unified ISB sound. It displayed their abilities as multi-instrumentalists and singer-songwriters, and gained them much wider acclaim. The album included Heron&#x27;s &quot;The Hedgehog&#x27;s Song&quot;, Williamson&#x27;s &quot;First Girl I Loved&quot; (later recorded by Judy Collins, Jackson Browne, Don Partridge and Wizz Jones) and his &quot;Mad Hatter&#x27;s Song&quot;, which, with its mixture of musical styles, paved the way for the band&#x27;s more extended forays into psychedelia. Enthusiastic reviews in the music press were accompanied by appearances at venues such as London&#x27;s UFO Club (co-owned by Boyd), the Speakeasy Club, and Queen Elizabeth Hall. Their exposure on John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Perfumed Garden&quot; radio show on the pirate ship Radio London and later on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; made them favourites with the emerging UK underground audience. The album went to Number One in the UK folk chart, and was named by Paul McCartney as one of his favourite records of that year.

===&quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot; and &quot;Wee Tam and the Big Huge&quot;: 1968===
1968 was the band&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; with the release of their two most-celebrated albums, &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot; and the double LP &quot;Wee Tam and the Big Huge&quot; (issued as two separate albums in the US). &quot;Hangman&#x27;s&quot; reached the top 5 in the UK album charts soon after its release in March 1968 and was nominated for a Grammy in the US. Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin said his group found their way by playing &quot;Hangman&#x27;s&quot; and following the instructions. A departure from the band&#x27;s previous albums, the set relied heavily on a more layered production, with imaginative use of the then new multitrack recording techniques. The album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Williamson songs, such as &quot;The Minotaur&#x27;s Song&quot;, a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Heron&#x27;s &quot;A Very Cellular Song&quot;, a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas, its complex structure incorporating a Bahamian spiritual (&quot;I Bid You Goodnight&quot;). Williamson and Heron in this album had added their girlfriends, Licorice McKechnie and Rose Simpson, to the band to contribute additional vocals and various instruments, including organ, guitar and percussion. Despite their initially rudimentary skills, Simpson swiftly became a proficient bass guitarist, and some of McKechnie&#x27;s songs were recorded by the band.

By early 1968, the group were capable of filling major venues in the UK. They left behind their folk club origins and embarked on a nationwide tour, incorporating a critically acclaimed appearance at the London Royal Festival Hall. Later in the year, they performed at the Royal Albert Hall, at open-air festivals, and at prestigious rock venues, such as the Fillmore auditoriums in San Francisco and New York. After their appearance at the Fillmore East in New York, they were introduced to the practice of Scientology by David Simons (aka &quot;Rex Rakish&quot; and &quot;Bruno Wolfe&quot;, once of Jim Kweskin&#x27;s Jug Band). Joe Boyd, in his book &quot;White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s&quot; and elsewhere, described how he was inadvertently responsible for their &quot;conversion&quot; when he introduced the band to Simons, who, having become a Scientologist, persuaded them to enrol in his absence. The band&#x27;s support for Scientology over the next few years was controversial among some fans and seemed to coincide with what many saw as the beginning of a decline in the quality of their work. In an interview with &quot;Oz&quot; magazine in 1969, the band spoke enthusiastically of their involvement with it, although the question of its effect on their later albums has provoked much discussion ever since.

Their November 1968 album &quot;Wee Tam and the Big Huge&quot;, recorded before the US trip, was musically less experimental and lush than &quot;Hangman&#x27;s&quot; but conceptually even more avant-garde, a full-on engagement with the themes of mythology, religion, awareness and identity. Williamson&#x27;s otherworldly songs and vision dominate the album, though Heron&#x27;s more grounded tracks are also among his very best, and the contrast between the two perspectives gives the record its uniquely dynamic interplay between a sensual experience of life and a quest for metaphysical meaning. The record was released as a double album and also simultaneously as two separate LPs, a strategy which lessened its impact on the charts.

===Woodstock and multimedia: 1969–70===

At this time, most of the group lived communally at a farmhouse near Newport, in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where they developed ideas for mixed media experiments with Malcolm Le Maistre and other members of David Medalla&#x27;s Exploding Galaxy troupe and the Leonard Halliwell Quartet. There, a film was made about the ISB, &quot;Be Glad For the Song Has No Ending&quot;. Originally planned for BBC TV&#x27;s arts programme Omnibus, it featured documentary footage and a fantasy sequence, &#x27;The Pirate and the Crystal Ball&#x27;, illustrating their attempt at an idyllic communal lifestyle. It made little impact at the time, but reissues on video and DVD have contributed to the recent revival of interest in the band.

The band toured for much of 1969, in the US and the UK. In July they played at the Albert Hall on the fourth night of the &quot;Pop Proms&quot;. They were introduced by John Peel and talked about their first brush with Scientology. Other acts in the week were Led Zeppelin and The Who. On 28 May 1969 the band received a phone call from Michael Lang, the producer of the momentous Woodstock Festival, asking the band to perform at the festival for a payment of $4,500. In August, they were slotted to play on Friday when all the folk-oriented and acoustic acts were expected to perform. However, the band refused to perform in the pouring rain, so stage manager John Morris rescheduled their performance for the following day. Their open slot was taken by Melanie, whose showing inspired her song, &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot;. The following day, 16 August 1969, at approximately 6:30 p.m., the band played in between the Keef Hartley Band and Canned Heat. The crowd was not anticipating the band&#x27;s performance on a day that featured mainly hard rock acts. For that reason, the group was generally disfavoured and, perhaps more importantly, were not included in the filming of the festival. Over the Labor Day weekend in 1969, they appeared at the Texas International Pop Festival, in Lewisville, Texas. In November, they released the album &quot;Changing Horses&quot;, which was generally seen as a disappointment after their earlier work. By late 1969, they had established a communal base at Glen Row near Innerleithen. In April 1970 they released the album &quot;I Looked Up&quot;.

The ISB&#x27;s performances were more theatrical than those of most of their contemporaries. In addition to the spectacle of their exotic instruments and colourful stage costumes, their concerts sometimes featured poems, surreal sketches and dancers, all in the homegrown, non-showbiz style characteristic of the hippie era. In 1970, Robin Williamson (with little input from Heron) attempted to fuse the music with his theatrical fantasies in a quixotic multimedia spectacular at London&#x27;s Roundhouse called &quot;U&quot;, which he envisaged as &quot;a surreal parable in dance and song&quot;. It combined the band&#x27;s music with dancing by the Stone Monkey troupe (which had evolved out of Exploding Galaxy), the letter U representing a transition from a high level of spiritual awareness to a low, then returning to a final peak of awareness and communication. Although the performance was ambitious, critical response was mixed, with some harsh reviews from critics who had in some cases acclaimed their earlier work. It fared little better in New York, and a planned US tour of &quot;U&quot; had to be cancelled after a few performances at the Fillmore East. Joe Boyd described the show as &quot;a disaster&quot;.

===Diminishing returns: 1971–74===
After that, the group lasted another four years, although there was a gradual decline in their status and commercial success after 1970. Joe Boyd, whose skillful handling of the band had contributed much to their international success, stopped managing them and returned to the US. The group left Elektra Records and signed with Island, for whom they recorded five albums. The first was a soundtrack to the &quot;Be Glad...&quot; film, and this was followed by the eclectic &quot;Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air&quot;, regarded as their best album for some time.

The band continued to tour and record. Rose Simpson left in 1971 and was replaced by Malcolm Le Maistre, formerly of the Stone Monkey troupe. Mike Heron took time out to record a well-received solo album, &quot;Smiling Men with Bad Reputations&quot;, which, in contrast to the ISB&#x27;s self-contained productions, featured a host of session guests, among them Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Keith Moon, John Cale and Richard Thompson. The following year, Licorice left, and was replaced by Gerard Dott, an Edinburgh jazz musician and friend of both Heron and Williamson who had contributed to &quot;Smiling Men.&quot; Williamson also recorded a solo album, &quot;Myrrh&quot;, which featured some of his most extraordinary vocal performances.

The group&#x27;s changing lineup, adding Stan Schnier (aka &quot;Stan Lee&quot;) on bass, Jack Ingram on drums, and Graham Forbes on electric guitar, reflected moves toward a more conventional amplified rock group. Their final albums for Island were received disappointingly, and the label dropped them in 1974. By then, disagreements between Williamson and Heron about musical policy had become irreconcilable, and they split up in October 1974.

===Solo careers: 1974–2014===

Williamson soon formed Robin Williamson and His Merry Band, which toured and released three albums of eclectic music with a Celtic emphasis. Within a few years, he went on to a solo career, moving between traditional Celtic styles and more avant-garde material. He also produced several recordings of humorous stories. In all, Williamson released over forty albums post-ISB. Notable in this output are the Grammy-nominated &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (1995, with John Renbourn) and four records on the jazz/classical/avant-garde ECM label: &quot;The Seed-at-Zero&quot; (2000), &quot;Skirting the River Road&quot; (2002), &quot;The Iron Stone&quot; (2006), and &quot;Trusting in the Rising Light&quot; (2014). Heron formed a rock group with Malcolm Le Maistre, called first Mike Heron&#x27;s Reputation, then just Heron, and later released occasional solo albums. Malcolm Le Maistre continued teaching in schools and performing theatre and music, and he released two albums.

===Reunion and final separation: 1999–2006===
In 1997, Williamson and Heron got back together for two concerts, which were warmly received. This was followed by a full reunion of the original three members plus Williamson&#x27;s wife, Bina, and Lawson Dando in 1999. However, they did not recapture the high reputation of the original ISB, playing mostly small venues to mixed critical and audience responses. In March 2003, it was announced that Robin and Bina Williamson had &quot;temporarily&quot; left to pursue other projects and their solo careers. Rumours circulated of an acrimonious split. A long-standing agreement between Williamson and Heron that neither would use the name &#x27;Incredible String Band&#x27; without the other&#x27;s involvement was bypassed by a temporary re-branding as &#x27;incrediblestringband2003&#x27;. Heron, Palmer and Dando, and new member Clare &quot;Fluff&quot; Smith, continued to tour regularly around the United Kingdom and internationally. Heron, Dando and Palmer toured the US in 2004. Another live album was released in 2005. Their last concert together was at the Moseley Folk Festival, Birmingham, UK, in September 2006.

===Barbican: 2009===
In 2009, Heron and Palmer announced a concert entitled &quot;Very Cellular Songs: The Music of the Incredible String Band&quot; at The Barbican, featuring Richard Thompson, Danny Thompson, Robyn Hitchcock, Alasdair Roberts, Trembling Bells, Green Gartside, and Dr Strangely Strange.

==Musical style==
Stylistically the ISB were centred around the idioms of conventional folk and pop, but their notable experimentation with musical form, instrumentation and styles (e.g. Indian and Moroccan) led them to innovative, often eclectic, compositions. In 1967–68 they were described as part of pop music&#x27;s &quot;underground&quot;. Williamson claimed that, as both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones saw them play before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; were recorded, the ISB were an influence on those albums. Chris Cutler commented that &quot;They were one of the most important bands of that era ... Instead of AABABA etc., their developments would go linearly, A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M and beyond; no one else &quot;thought&quot; that way ever ...&quot; [emphasis in original] One of Bob Dylan&#x27;s favourite songs was &quot;October Song&quot;from ISB&#x27;s debut album. Robert Plant claimed that Led Zeppelin found their way by playing &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot; (see above). Following in the footsteps of ISB, Led Zeppelin later successfully incorporated Moroccan rhythms (e.g. on &quot;Dancing Days&quot;).

Both Mike Heron and Robin Williamson would insert seemingly unrelated sections in their songs in a way that has been described as &quot;always surprising, laughably inventive, lyrically prodigious&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1994, Rose Simpson, a former member of the band, became Mayoress of Aberystwyth. In 2003, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who had previously chosen &quot;The Hedgehog&#x27;s Song&quot; when he appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, wrote a foreword for a full-length book about the band, describing them as &quot;holy&quot;. Licorice McKechnie was last seen in 1987, and may be deceased.

<text>Krasnodar Krai (, ) is a federal subject of Russia (a krai), located in the North Caucasus region in Southern Russia and is administratively a part of the Southern Federal District. Its administrative center is the city of Krasnodar. The third most populous federal subject in Russia, it had a population of 5,838,273 as of the 2021 Census.

Krasnodar Krai is formally and informally referred to as Kuban (), a term denoting the historical region of Kuban situated between the Sea of Azov and the Kuban River which is predominantly within the krai. It is bordered by Rostov Oblast to the north, Stavropol Krai to the east, Karachay-Cherkessia to the south-east. Adygea is an enclave entirely within the krai. Krasnodar Krai shares an international border with Georgia and the partially-recognized republic of Abkhazia to the south, and borders annexed Crimea to the west, across the Kerch Strait.

The northern part of the krai takes in a part of the Don Steppe, while the southern part has a distinctive Mediterranean climate which has made it a popular tourist location. Novorossiysk is Russia&#x27;s main port on the Black Sea, one of the few cities awarded the title of the Hero City, 
and Sochi was the host of the XXII Olympic Winter Games in 2014. Krasnodar Krai is home to significant infrastructure of the Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet.

==Geography==
Krasnodar Krai is located in the southwestern part of the North Caucasus and borders Rostov Oblast in the northeast, Stavropol Krai and Karachay-Cherkessia in the east, and with the Abkhazia region (internationally recognized as part of Georgia) in the south. The Republic of Adygea is completely encircled by the krai territory. The krai&#x27;s Taman Peninsula is situated between the Sea of Azov in the north and the Black Sea in the south. In the west, the Kerch Strait separates the krai from the contested Crimean Peninsula, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine but under &quot;de facto&quot; Russian control. At its widest extent, the krai stretches for from north to south and for from east to west.

The krai is split into two distinct parts by the Kuban River, which gave its name to this entire geographic region. The southern, seaward part is the western extremity of the Caucasus range, lying within the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion; the climate is Mediterranean or, in the southeast, subtropical. Historically it is known as Circassia. The northern part is a steppe zone which shares continental climate patterns. It is also known as Kuban region.

The height of the mountains exceeds , with Mount Tsakhvoa being the highest at ,with Mount Fisht, at , being the Great Caucasus&#x27; westernmost peak with a glacier.

The Black Sea coast stretches from the Kerch Strait to Adler and is shielded by the Caucasus Mountains from the cold northern winds. Numerous small mountain rivers flow in the coastal areas, often creating picturesque waterfalls.

Lake Abrau, located in the wine-making region of Abrau-Dyurso, is the largest lake in the northeastern Caucasus region.

==History==

The region&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants are referred to, generally, as the &quot;Maiōtai&quot;, who are the ancestors of the modern-day Circassians, Abkhazians and Abazins (after the Greek name for the Sea of Azov). During the 6th century BC, Pontic Greeks founded the area&#x27;s first cities, such as &quot;Phanagoria&quot; (near modern Sennoy) and &quot;Hermonassa&quot; (on the Taman Peninsula), who traded with nomadic tribes including the &quot;Skuthai&quot; (Scythians) and &quot;Sindi&quot;.

In the 7th century, Phanagoria served as the capital of Old Great Bulgaria. From the 8th to the 10th centuries, the area was dominated by the Khazars, a Turkic people who had earlier migrated from the east onto the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, where a hypothesis claims that they converted to Judaism. After the defeat of the Khazar Khanate in 965 Kievan Prince Svyatoslav conquered the area, it came under the rule of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and it then formed the Tmutarakan principality. Later, due to the increasing claims of the Eastern Roman Empire at the end of the 11th century, the Tmutarakan principality came under the authority of the Eastern Roman Emperors (until 1204).

In that period of history, the Circassians were first mentioned, under the ethnonym &quot;Kassogs&quot;. For example, the Kassog Prince Rededya was mentioned in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;.

In 1243–1438, the current territory of the Kuban was part of the Golden Horde. After the latter&#x27;s collapse, parts of Kuban were held under the Crimean Khanate, Circassia, and the Ottoman Empire, which dominated the region. The Tsardom of Russia began to challenge the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire in the area during the Russo-Turkish wars.

In April 1783, after the liquidation of the Crimean Khanate, right-bank Kuban and Taman Peninsula were annexed to the Russian Empire by decree of Catherine II. In 1792–1794, the Cossacks moved there from Zaporizhzhia, now located in Ukraine, and formed the Black Sea Area troops, with the creation of a solid cordon line for the Kuban River and the marginalization of the neighboring Circassians. The administrative region was accorded the status of &quot;Land of Black Sea Cossack Army&quot;, with its center in the city of Yekaterinodar (renamed Krasnodar by the Bolsheviks in 1920).

In 1900, the region&#x27;s population numbered around two million people. In 1913, the gross grain harvest Kuban region entered second place in Russia, for the production of marketable grain – in first place. During the Russian Civil War, the anti-communist Kuban People&#x27;s Republic was established on 28 January 1918. It sought union with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic during its brief independence until Soviet forces occupied the latter in May 1920.

Krasnodar Krai was founded on 13 September 1937, when Azov-Black Sea Krai of the Russian SFSR was split up in Krasnodar Krai and Rostov Oblast. The Greek Autonomous District and Shapsug national district were located within the Krai. On 30 January 1996 Krasnodar Krai signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 12 April 2002.

===2012 floods===
On July 7, 2012, at least 171 people died in Krasnodar Krai, after torrential rains overnight caused the worst flooding and landslides in more than seventy years. Over of rain – the typical amount for a four- or five-month period – was reported to have fallen within forty-eight hours. A local police spokesman stated that most of the dead were in Krymsky District, where at least 159 died when a wave of water high swept through the town of Krymsk in the middle of the night. Ten more deaths occurred in Gelendzhik, including five electrocuted when a transformer fell into the floodwater, and two in Novorossiysk. Authorities stated that 17 people had been officially reported missing, and there were fears the death toll would rise further, while medics had hospitalized 210 people, including 16 children.

The regional government claimed that over 24,000 people were affected by the floods, with more than 3,000 evacuated, and that more than 10,000 rescuers and 140 helicopters were searching for victims and evacuating survivors. In Krymsk, 14 temporary shelters were set up to house around 2,000 evacuees. The transport system in the region was said to have collapsed, while oil shipments from Novorossiysk were halted when the port, located in the lower part of the city, was threatened by landslides. Russia&#x27;s President Vladimir Putin flew to the area to hold emergency talks with officials in Krymsk, while authorities in Perm Krai dispatched a rescue team to evacuate dozens of children from the region, who had been staying at summer camps on the Black Sea coast.

Residents of Krymsk claimed the wave of water that hit the town resulted from the sluice gates of a nearby reservoir being opened, although the prosecutor general&#x27;s investigative committee denied this. Local prosecutors had earlier confirmed that the gates were opened, but stated that it was too early to determine whether this was the cause of the flooding.

During the Soviet period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Krasnodar CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the Krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the Krai Executive Committee (executive power). In 1991, the CPSU lost power, and the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor have been since appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament.

The Charter of Krasnodar Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Krasnodar Krai is the province&#x27;s standing legislative (representative) body. The assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the krai government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The krai administration supports the governor&#x27;s activities, who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the Krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

==Administrative divisions==
Krasnodar Krai is administratively divided into thirty-eight districts (&quot;raions&quot;) and fifteen cities of district equivalence. The districts and cities are further subdivided into eleven towns, plus urban-type settlements, and rural okrugs and stanitsa okrugs.

==Economy==

As a result of 2014 Winter Olympics, Krasnodar Krai has seen significant infrastructure spending. Over $50 billion has been spent on various infrastructure projects including a bullet train. 

Large companies in the region include Tander, Novorossmetal, Autonomous Heat Energy Company, Gazprom gas distribution Krasnodar, and Evrokhim Chemical Fertilizers.

===Transportation===
Several lines of Russian Railways cross the region and link it with Abkhazia, Ukraine, and neighboring Russian regions. There are direct trains from resort cities like Sochi and Anapa to Moscow, via Krasnodar, which become very popular during the summer vacation season. There are also suburb train connections.
The Apsheronsk narrow-gauge railway, the longest mountain narrow-gauge railway in Russia, runs through Krasnodar Krai.

There are several airports in the region, including Krasnodar International Airport, Sochi International Airport, Anapa Airport, and Gelendzhik Airport.

The biggest ports are Novorossiysk and Tuapse. Others are Eisk and Temryuk on the Azov Sea, and Port Kavkaz, Taman, Anapa, Gelendzhik, and Sochi on the Black Sea. The Crimean Bridge connects Krasnodar Krai and Crimea.

===Settlements===
The population of Krasnodar Krai is concentrated in the Kuban River drainage basin, which was traditionally Cossack land (see&quot; History of Cossacks&quot;). The Kuban Cossacks are now generally considered to be ethnic Russians, even though they are still an important minority in their own right in the area. Historically, they were considered to be ethnic Ukrainian, and reported their language as Ukrainian in censuses well into the 20th century (see &quot;National Identity of Kuban Cossacks&quot;). This change in identity is due to assimilation and historical persecution of the Kuban Cossacks, which was particularly prominent due to questions of their loyalty to Moscow and the Communist state during the Russian Revolution and First World War.

Other notable ethnic groups include the Adyghe, who are the region&#x27;s indigenous population and were nearly completely annihilated following the Circassian genocide, and the Armenians (including Christian Hamsheni and Cherkesogai), who have lived in the region since at least the 18th century.

==Television films==

====First episode proper====
===Reunion films===

Many American TV series have had TV films, usually filmed five or more years after the run of the original series, which reunite the cast of the series for a new plot. In some cases, there has been an entire string of such films, including for the detective shows &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957-1966; 30 films from 1985 to 1995), &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, (1974–80; eight films from 1994 to 1999), and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979-1984; eight films from 1993 to 1996). In at least one case, with the 1988 &quot;Get Smart&quot; reunion film &quot;Get Smart, Again!&quot;, the success of the TV film eventually led to a brief 1995 revival of the series.

There have also been many television reunion specials, in which some or all of the original cast is brought together for interviews and clips.

===Specials===
Television series that have had standalone episodes as films, from continuations and resolutions of storylines through expanded installments with similar miscellaneous purposes, and specials based on their respective characters and elements for alternative reasons of otherwise.

==Programs re-edited for release as feature-length films==
One or more episodes from the following television programs were edited together for release as a feature film. Some of the films add new material, and others do not.

*&quot;The All-New Pink Panther Show&quot;
*&quot;Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe&quot;
*&quot;Doctor Who&quot;: The 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), and series 8 opener, &quot;Deep Breath&quot; (2014), were both shown in theatres alongside their premiere broadcast.
*&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;: Six episodes were released in theaters to coincide with the high-definition release of the series on Blu-ray.
*&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;: The episodes &quot;The Watchers on the Wall&quot; and &quot;The Children&quot; were given a week-long IMAX release.
*&quot;Walt Disney anthology television series&quot;: Many select television films that aired in the anthology, including &quot;Guns in the Heather&quot; and &quot;The Omega Connection&quot;, were adapted for theatrical release in international territories.

<text>Krasnodar, formerly Yekaterinodar (until 1920) is the largest city and the administrative centre of Krasnodar Krai, Russia. The city stands on the Kuban River in southern Russia, with a population of 1,138,654 residents, and up to 1.244 million residents in the Urban Okrug. In the past decade Krasnodar has experienced rapid population growth, rising to become the thirteenth-largest city in Russia, and the second-largest city in southern Russia, as well as the Southern Federal District. 

The city originated in 1793 as a fortress built by the Cossacks, and became a trading center for southern Russia. The city sustained heavy damage in World War II but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. Krasnodar is a major economic hub in southern Russia; In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Krasnodar the best city for business in Russia. Krasnodar is home to numerous sights, including the Krasnodar Stadium. Its main airport is Krasnodar International Airport.

==Name==
Krasnodar was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as &quot;Yekaterinodar&quot; (). The original name meant &quot;Catherine&#x27;s Gift&quot;, recognizing both Catherine the Great&#x27;s grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (created from former Zaporozhian Cossacks) and Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who is considered to be the patron of the city. City status was granted in 1867.

On December 7, 1920, as a result of the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed &quot;Krasnodar&quot; (&quot;Gift of the Reds&quot;). The new name consists of &quot;Krasno-&quot; (Красно- – &#x27;red&#x27;, i.e. Communist, but also archaic/poetic form of &#x27;beautiful&#x27;); and &quot;dar&quot; (дар – &#x27;gift&#x27;).

==History==


The city originated in 1793 as a military camp, then as a fortress built by the Cossacks to defend imperial borders and to assert Russian dominion over Circassia, a claim which Ottoman Turkey contested. In the first half of the 19th century, Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks, gaining official town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city, which had become a vital trade center for southern Russia. In 1897 an obelisk commemorating the two-hundred-year history of the Kuban Cossacks (seen as founded in 1696) was erected in Yekaterinodar. The city was the administrative center of the Yekaterinodarsky Otdel of the Kuban Oblast.

During the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) the city changed hands several times, coming successively under the control of the Red Army and of the Volunteer Army. Many Kuban Cossacks, as committed anti-Bolsheviks, supported the White Movement. Lavr Kornilov, a White general, besieged the city on April 10, 1918, only to be killed a week later when a Bolshevik artillery shell blew up the farmhouse where he had set up his headquarters. During the Soviet famine of 1932–1933 Krasnodar lost over 14% of its population.

During World War II units of the German Army occupied Krasnodar between August 9, 1942, and February 12, 1943 as part of Operation Edelweiss. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war. German forces, including Gestapo and mobile SS execution squads, killed thousands of Jews, Communists, and suspected Communist partisans. Shooting, hanging, burning, and even gas vans were used.

In the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and for participation in war crimes. The first such trial took place at Krasnodar from July 14 to 17, 1943. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily carried out in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.

On June 14, 1971, a bombing occurred on a bus in the city, when a homemade suitcase bomb placed near the gas tank by a mentally ill Peter Volynsky exploded. The bomb killed 10 persons and wounded 20–90 others.

<doc id="474131" wikidata="Q263104" url="?curid=474131" title="Kinuyo Tanaka">
<text>was a Japanese actress and film director. She had a career lasting over 50 years with more than 250 acting credits, but was best known for her 15 films with director Kenji Mizoguchi, such as &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; (1952) and &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953). With her 1953 directorial debut, &quot;Love Letter&quot;, Tanaka became the second Japanese woman to direct a film, after Tazuko Sakane.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Tanaka was born in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, the youngest of nine children of Kumekichi and Yasu Tanaka. Her family were &quot;kimono&quot; merchants. Although her family was originally wealthy, after her father Kumekichi died in 1912, the family began having financial troubles. She learned playing the biwa at an early age and moved to Osaka in 1920, where she joined the Biwa Girls&#x27; Operetta Troupe. Tanaka&#x27;s first credited film appearance was in &quot;Genroku Onna&quot; (lit. &quot;A Woman of the Genroku era&quot;) in 1924, which also marked the start of her affiliation with the Shochiku Studios. She lived with director Hiroshi Shimizu from 1927 to 1929 after appearing in a number of his films; although they separated in 1929, she starred in some of his later films. Tanaka remained unmarried for her entire life and had no children.

She became a leading actress at an early age, appearing in Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s &quot;I Graduated, But...&quot; in 1929. The following year she played the lead in &quot;Aiyoku no ki&quot; (&quot;Record of Love and Desire&quot; or &quot;Desire of Night&quot;), and in 1931 she appeared in Japan&#x27;s first sound film, &quot;The Neighbor&#x27;s Wife and Mine&quot;, directed by Heinosuke Gosho. Gosho also directed her in his adaptation of the famous Yasunari Kawabata story, &quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; (1933). In the 1930s, Tanaka became so popular that the titles of many feature films used her name, as in &quot;Kinuyo Monogatari&quot; (&quot;The Kinuyo Story&quot;), &quot;Joi Kinuyo Sensei&quot; (&quot;Doctor Kinuyo&quot;) and &quot;Kinuyo no Hatsukoi&quot; (&quot;Kinuyo&#x27;s First Love&quot;). In 1938, she starred in Hiromasa Nomura&#x27;s &quot;Aizen katsura&quot; with Ken Uehara, who was the highest-grossing movie of the prewar period. In 1940, she worked with Kenji Mizoguchi for the first time, starring in &quot;Naniwa Onna&quot; (&quot;A Woman of Osaka&quot;), which is regarded as a lost film. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Ornamental Hairpin&quot;, directed by Shimizu, which nowadays ranks, also thanks to Tanaka&#x27;s performance, as one of the director&#x27;s most mature achievements. 1944 saw her first collaboration with director Keisuke Kinoshita in the patriotic piece &quot;Army&quot;. The film became famous for its finale which, a subversion of its militarist message, showed a mother (Tanaka) desperately trying to catch a last glimpse of her son who is marching off to war.

===Post-war career===

Starting in October 1949, Tanaka made a three-month trip to the United States as one of Japan&#x27;s first post-war cultural envoys. On her return, Tanaka displayed an inheritance of cultural mannerisms from America which many of her fans found distasteful. She resigned from Shochiku and announced her intention of going freelance, which would give her more scope to choose which directors she wished to work with. She subsequently worked on films with Mikio Naruse, Ozu, Kinoshita, Gosho and others. She had a close working relationship with director Kenji Mizoguchi, having parts in 15 of his films, including leading roles in &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; (1952), &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953) and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954). A recurrent topic of these films, both contemporary and historic dramas, was the fate of women mistreated by family, lovers and society. Tanaka&#x27;s and Mizoguchi&#x27;s involvement was the subject of much speculation, on which the actress commented in the 1975 documentary &quot;Kenji Mizoguchi: The Life of a Film Director&quot; that she and Mizoguchi were &quot;married in front of the camera, but not behind it&quot;. Their working relationship ended when Mizoguchi countered a recommendation from the Directors Guild of Japan for the Nikkatsu studio to hire her as a director.

===Director and actress===
Tanaka was the second Japanese woman who worked as a film director, after Tazuko Sakane. Despite Mizoguchi&#x27;s objection against her application, Tanaka was able to give her directing debut with &quot;Love Letter&quot; in 1953. Scripted by Kinoshita, it was entered as a contestant in the Cannes Film Festival in 1954. She directed five more films between 1953 and 1962, focusing on the subject of femininity; while her films received less attention from contemporary commentators and Tanaka herself downplayed them, interest in them has been revived in recent years for their unique and pioneering portrayals of Japanese women. &quot;The Moon Has Risen&quot; (&quot;Tsuki wa noborinu&quot;) in 1955 was scripted by Yasujirō Ozu, and &quot;The Wandering Princess&quot; (&quot;Ruten no onna&quot;) was scripted by Natto Wada and starred Machiko Kyō. One of Tanaka&#x27;s most acknowledged films, &quot;The Eternal Breasts&quot;, follows the biography of the late tanka poet Fumiko Nakajo (1922–1954). In addition to her directing jobs, Tanaka continued with her acting career, appearing in Kinoshita&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad Of Narayama&quot; (1958), for which she received the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Actress, and in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Red Beard&quot; (1965). During the 1960s, she moved increasingly towards television. For her performance as an aged prostitute in Kei Kumai&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Sandakan N° 8&quot; she won the Best Actress Award at the 25th Berlin International Film Festival.

Tanaka died of a brain tumor on 21 March 1977.

==Legacy==

Director Masaki Kobayashi, to whom she was second cousin, initiated an award bearing her name. Since 1985, the Kinuyo Tanaka Award (田中絹代賞) for an actress&#x27; works and career is awarded at the annual Mainichi Film Concours ceremony.

A wave of renewed international interest in Tanaka&#x27;s work started in 2012 with a symposium and retrospective at the University of Leeds. In 2018, Irene Gonzalez-Lopez and Michael Smith published the first English-language collection on Tanaka&#x27;s work and life, &quot;Tanaka Kinuyo: Nation, Stardom and Female Subjectivity&quot;.
In 2020, artistic director of the Locarno Film Festival Lili Hinstin announced a major retrospective dedicated to Tanaka actress and director, postponed in 2021 due to the Covid Pandemic situation and then cancelled after she left the festival.

In 2021, all six of the films Tanaka directed were screened theatrically in digitally remastered versions at the Cannes Film Festival and the Lyon Film Festival. Three of these films were presented in 4K restorations at the 34th Tokyo International Film Festival.

<text>This is a list of Royal Air Force commands, both past and present. Although the concept of a command dates back to the foundation of the Royal Air Force, the term command (as the name of a formation) was first used in purely RAF-context in 1936 when Bomber Command, Fighter Command, Coastal Command and Training Command were formed. Since that time the RAF has made considerable use of the term. Until early 2007, the RAF had two commands, Strike Command and Personnel and Training Command, which were co-located at RAF High Wycombe. On 1 April 2007, the two were merged to form Air Command.

<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan is a conservative political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Founded in 1905 by former Northwest Territories Premier Frederick Haultain, the party was first known as the Provincial Rights Party. In 1912, its name changed to the Conservative Party of Saskatchewan, and in 1942 it adopted its current name. Members are commonly known as Tories.

The party has formed government in Saskatchewan three times, first in a coalition government from 1929 to 1934, and then in consecutive majority governments from 1982 to 1991. The party was badly damaged by an expense fraud scandal in the 1990s. In 1997, the party went dormant when much of its membership migrated to the newly established Saskatchewan Party. Although the party has been active again since the 2007 provincial election, no PC candidates have been elected since 1995.

==History==

===Early years (1905–1934)===

The party was founded in 1905. Saskatchewan joined Confederation on September 1, 1905, and its first election was slated for December of that year. Former Northwest Territories Premier Frederick Haultain had been instrumental in the granting of provincehood. However, while he had advocated for the creation of one large western province—for which he favoured the name Buffalo—Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s federal government opted to create two new provinces instead, with Alberta joining Confederation alongside Saskatchewan. Moreover, like Manitoba a generation earlier, the two new provinces were denied rights over their natural resources. In response, Haultain re-branded his Territorial Conservative Association as the Provincial Rights Party in a bid to become premier of Saskatchewan.

Haultain&#x27;s party was defeated by the Liberal Party in the 1905 election, becoming the Official Opposition with 47.5% of the vote. The 1908 election brought a similar result, with the PR party remaining in Opposition. In 1912, Haultain left politics when he was appointed the Chief Justice of Saskatchewan. When he left, the party opted to re-adopt the Conservative name under the leadership of Wellington Willoughby. The change did not improve the party&#x27;s fortunes; it lost a third straight election in 1912 to the Liberals and Premier Walter Scott, with its share of the vote falling to 42%. In fact, the Liberals built an impressive political dynasty, securing further majority governments in 1917, 1921, and 1925. In 1921, the Tories were reduced to third-party status as the agrarian Progressive Party gained Opposition status. However, party fortunes began to improve when James T. M. Anderson became leader in 1924.

Anderson had moved to Saskatchewan in 1908 to be a teacher, and in 1918 the Liberal government appointed him as provincial director of education among new Canadians, a role in which he advocated for more assimilationist policies towards the rapidly growing immigrant population. The following decade, Anderson capitalized on the racial and religious animosity created by the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Saskatchewan—the organization boasted 25,000 members in the province by 1929—to gain support for Conservative policies on immigration and education; in 1928, Liberal Premier Jimmy Gardiner claimed that the Klan was a tool of the Conservative Party. There certainly was crossover between the organizations, and the Conservatives aided Klan organization by providing it with party membership lists.

In the 1929 election, Anderson led the party to its best performance in the first half of the twentieth century, securing 36% of the popular vote and 24 of 63 seats. Despite having fewer seats than the Liberals&#x27; 28, the Conservatives were able to form a coalition government with the support of Progressive and Independents Legislative members (MLAs), and Anderson became Premier. What was known as the &quot;Co-operative government&quot; would introduce amendments to the &quot;Schools Act&quot;, banning French as a language of instruction and the display of religious symbols in Catholic schools, amendments applauded at the 1930 Klan convention. The government was also successful in curbing patronage through its Public Service Act.

The Anderson-led coalition took office immediately before the onset of the Great Depression, which proved particularly severe on the Prairies. The government&#x27;s retrenchment in response—similar to R. B. Bennett&#x27;s federal Conservative government—opened it to attacks from the Liberals as well as a new socialist political movement going by the name of Farmer–Labour, which would in 1935 become the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). The government did establish the Saskatchewan Relief Commission to provide some aid to residents, but this did not address the systemic issues creating depression conditions. In 1932, Anderson asked Liberal leader Gardiner to join the coalition, but the Opposition refused. In the 1934 election, the Liberals returned to power and Anderson&#x27;s Conservatives were wiped out, failing to win a single seat as the Farmer–Labour Group took over Official Opposition status.

===Political wilderness (1934–1975)===
After the 1934 defeat, Anderson stayed on as party leader until 1936, when the party chose a young lawyer, John Diefenbaker, as his successor. Although Diefenbaker would go on to revive the fortunes of the federal Progressive Conservatives in the 1950s, he was not able to gain ground as the provincial party leader. However, it was not just Diefenbaker. Between 1934 and 1975, only two PC members—the party adopted the Progressive Conservative name in 1942, in line with the federal party—would be elected to the Saskatchewan Legislature: one in a 1953 by-election, and party leader Martin Pederson in the 1964 election; neither was re-elected. Those years were marked by an effective return to a two-party system consisting of the Liberals and the CCF, the latter of which formed five successive majority governments from 1944 to 1964, after which it became the New Democratic Party (NDP). The PCs spent long periods without a leader, and in the early 1970s nearly merged with the provincial Social Credit party; PC members in fact approved the merger in November 1970, but it was ultimately rejected by Social Credit members in February 1971.

===Return to the Legislature (1975–1982)===
The PC party was rejuvenated by the leadership of Dick Collver, who took over the party reins in 1973. The Liberals had formed two consecutive majority governments from 1964 to 1971; however, they were soundly defeated by Allan Blakeney&#x27;s NDP in 1971, and Liberal leader Ross Thatcher died just weeks after the election. Encouraged by the popularity of the federal PCs in Saskatchewan, Collver sensed an opportunity to gain ground, and presented himself as a populist leader railing against the big government of the NDP. The Tories returned to the legislature in the 1975 election, winning 7 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 15 and the NDP&#x27;s 39, marking the first time since 1929 that three major parties had sizeable representation in the Legislature. The results were even better for the Tories in the 1978 election as they surged to Official Opposition status, winning 17 seats while the Liberals were shut out for the first time in provincial history.

In a twist, Collver resigned the party leadership in 1979 to sit as an Independent. Some within the party had begun to see Collver and his business dealings—he was embroiled in a lawsuit with the provincial Government Insurance Office—as a liability. As an Independent, he still focused his criticism on the NDP government. Then, in March 1980, he announced the formation of a new party, which he called the Unionest Party. Apparently seized by prevalent feelings of western alienation and anti-communism, Collver&#x27;s new party advocated for a secession of Saskatchewan and the other western provinces from Canada and a union with the United States—the name Unionest was a portmanteau of &quot;best&quot; and &quot;union&quot;. One other PC MLA, Dennis Ham, joined Collver in sitting as a Unionest, but neither ran for re-election in 1982 and the party was dissolved. Collver&#x27;s abrupt departure from the PCs led to agricultural economist Grant Devine being named leader. Devine had lost his election bid in 1978, and he lost again in a 1980 by-election in the Estevan constituency. However, he stayed at the helm, leading the party into the 1982 election.

===Devine government (1982–1991)===
Devine led the Progressive Conservatives to a majority government for the first time in 1982, stunning the NDP by winning 55 out of 64 seats, reducing Blakeney&#x27;s party to nine seats. Devine had run on a program of tax and mortgage relief and on promoting free enterprise under the slogan, &quot;There&#x27;s so much more we can be&quot;. Notably, not a single member of the PC caucus had experience in government, and observers have noted that during this term, Devine&#x27;s government &quot;lacked ideological clarity&quot;. The PCs did cut taxes—eliminating the province&#x27;s 20% gasoline tax—and royalties, but it kept most government assets public and spent freely, rapidly running up a string of deficits. It used public money to support private ventures and, more than anything else, agriculture. The government offered a universal, low-interest loan program to farmers that cost the province $1 billion. By 1986, the government had raised the provincial debt to $1.5 billion. Part of Devine&#x27;s strategy was a close relationship with Brian Mulroney&#x27;s federal PC government, and in a particularly important move, Devine secured a $1 billion farming aid package from Ottawa on the eve of the 1986 election.

Saskatchewan historian Bill Waiser has argued that the Devine years marked a fundamental shift in Saskatchewan politics, with a widening divide between urban and rural Saskatchewan re-defining the province&#x27;s political landscape. Similarly, political analyst Dale Eisler has written that Saskatchewan politics can be grouped into distinct &quot;Before Devine&quot; and &quot;After Devine&quot; categories. Devine&#x27;s intent focus on rural priorities, and farming in particular, contributed to this divide. The results of the 1986 election bear this out. Blakeney&#x27;s NDP narrowly edged out the PCs in the popular vote, but the concentration of that vote in urban centres—the NDP won 16 out of 20 seats in Regina and Saskatoon—allowed Devine&#x27;s PC, who won a majority of rural seats, to form another majority government. In effect, Devine staked the PCs on rural support.

Possibly owing in part to the divided election result, and doubtless owing in part to a severe downturn in the provincial economy, Devine&#x27;s government adopted a more distinct ideological approach in its second term, which observers have labelled a &quot;new right&quot; neoliberal approach of cuts to spending and substantial privatization. The government sold off major assets such as SaskOil and PotashCorp, which had been significant sources of revenue and key achievements of the previous NDP government. The PCs also attempted to privatize SaskEnergy, but a legislative walk-out by the Opposition—and a public petition with over 100,000 signatures—prevented it. During this term, the government was also criticized for undemocratic legislative tactics, including proroguing the Legislature and financing expenditures through the dubious use of special warrants. Outrage toward its conduct and agenda—the government&#x27;s cuts to social spending precipitated what was one of the largest public protests in Regina history with approximately seven thousand people descending on the Legislature in 1987—along with the unpopularity of Mulroney&#x27;s federal government and a growing fiscal crisis, which saw provincial debt soar to $13 billion by 1992, all led to Devine&#x27;s government being defeated by the NDP in the 1991 election. By then, the fiscal crisis was so severe that the province was facing the risk of bankruptcy.

==== Thatcher murder conviction ====
In January 1983, energy minister Colin Thatcher resigned from cabinet. Days after Thatcher&#x27;s resignation, his ex-wife JoAnn Wilson was murdered, and Thatcher was charged with the crime in May 1984. In November 1984, a jury found him guilty and Thatcher was sentenced to life in prison for 25 years.

==== Expense fraud scandal ====
In April 1995, after an RCMP investigation dubbed &quot;Project Fiddle&quot;, police charged a dozen current and former PC MLAs as well as two caucus workers with fraud relating to an expense fraud scheme that ran from 1987 to 1991. In 1987, the caucus agreed to pool a portion of communications allowances into a central account. The party&#x27;s director of communications, John Scraba, siphoned cash from this account and stashed it in safety deposit boxes. Another former staffer alleged that this was common knowledge, and that &quot;if you needed money, all you had to do was go to John Scraba&quot;. Instances included former cabinet minister Joan Duncan, who pleaded guilty to fraud in the amount of $12,405, which was spent on a vacation in Hawaii, and former MLA Gerald Muirhead, who was found guilty of spending over $2,000 on an embroidered saddle and bridle sash.

Money was distributed through invoices from a series of shell companies for services that were never rendered or expenses that were illegitimate. Overall, the fraudulent expense claims totalled approximately $837,000. Police were first alerted to the scheme in 1991 when a legislative clerk reported suspicious invoices. In 1992, bank officials drilled into an unclaimed safety deposit box that contained $150,000; the box was addressed to the PC caucus office in the Saskatchewan Legislature. Nineteen staff or MLAs were charged in the scheme, and fifteen were convicted—including ten cabinet members and a caucus chair—with many serving jail time. Scraba was sentenced to two years in prison. Former MLA Michael Hopfner, whose defence claimed he was too financially incompetent to commit fraud, was sentenced to 18 months. The stiffest sentence went to former caucus chair Lorne McLaren at three and a half years. Other party members convicted in the scandal included Robert Andrew, Harry Baker, Eric Bernston, John Gerich, Grant Hodgins, Harold Martens, Beattie Martin, Michael McCafferty, Ray Meiklejohn, and Sherwin Petersen.

Former cabinet minister Jack Wolfe died by suicide in 1995. Already faced with the prospect of having to testify against former colleagues, Wolfe was informed by his lawyer on 2 February that he was going to be arrested; he was found dead that day.

Grant Devine was never charged in the fraud scheme; he testified that he was too busy to pay attention to finances and was unaware of the scheme, although he took responsibility as the leader of the party.

=== Opposition, the Sask Party, and dormancy (1991–2005) ===
The PCs were reduced to 10 seats in 1991 and became the Official Opposition. Devine resigned as PC leader in 1992, and Rick Swenson—who, like Devine, was not implicated in the expense fraud scandal—became interim leader. In 1994, the party chose Bill Boyd as its new permanent leader. Particularly when news began to break about the expense fraud scandal, the PCs were expected to be wiped out in the 1995 election. Boyd attempted to promote the party as the &quot;New PCs&quot;, while some PC candidates left the party name off their campaign materials altogether. The PCs ultimately held on to five seats as the Liberals surpassed them to become the Opposition to Roy Romanow&#x27;s NDP. Romanow had pursued further spending cuts in order to address the province&#x27;s fiscal crisis. While the NDP had balanced the finances by 1995, extensive cuts to rural health and education services further exacerbated the urban-rural divide. With neither the PCs nor the Liberals seeing a clear path back to power, four MLAs from each party—including Boyd and all representing rural districts—agreed in 1997 to walk away from their parties and help establish a new conservative party in a bid to unite the opposition to the NDP. The Saskatchewan Party was officially registered on 17 September 1997, and with eight MLAs, it became the Official Opposition.

Most PC members migrated to the new party—Romanow liked to emphasize this by calling the new party the &quot;Saskatories&quot;—and the party executive voted to effectively put the scandal-plagued PC Party into dormancy for at least two election cycles. In order to remain registered, the party ran a handful of paper candidates in both the 1999 and 2003 provincial elections. However, with so much of the PC membership along with its office and executive staff moving to the new party, the perception that the Sask Party was merely a re-branded PC Party persisted for years. Even Devine publicly expressed support for the Saskatchewan Party. One member who tried but was unable to make the move to the new party was PC MLA Jack Gooshen, who was convicted in 1999 of consorting with a 14-year old prostitute.

===Recent history (2005–present)===
In June 2005, the dormant PCs announced that they were taking applications for new members, and that a members&#x27; meeting would be held to decide the future of the party. Changes to provincial electoral laws passed during the previous Legislature decreased the number of candidates a party needed to run in general elections from ten to two. In 2006, members voted to resurrect the party and chose former interim leader Swenson as its new permanent leader.

The party ran into difficulties when trying to access its trust fund, which reportedly contained close to $3 million. In 2007, the party sued the Saskatchewan Party over access to the fund, alleging that the fund&#x27;s trustees—three of whom were active in the Sask Party—were conspiring with the Sask Party to deny them access and halt the PC party revival. The case was not settled until 2014, when Swenson announced that the PCs had been given control of the fund. In the meantime, the party ran five candidates in each of the 2007 and 2011 elections, capturing less than 0.5% of the overall vote in both elections. The party ran 18 candidates in the 2016 election, its largest number since 1995, and collected 1.3% of the vote while finishing third in 10 districts.

Swenson announced after the 2016 election that he would step aside as leader once a new leader was chosen. On November 3, 2018, Ken Grey was elected as the new leader of the party. In the 2020 provincial election, the party ran 31 candidates and captured 1.9% of the vote.

Grey resigned as leader on January 18, 2021. Later in the year, Grey alleged that conspiracy theorists and far-right elements were working to take over the party, a charge that the party denied. Grey cited as an example that he had been &quot;inundated&quot; with Islamophobic messages after he was photographed with an official from Pakistan in 2019. In November 2022, Rose Buscholl was appointed as interim leader in charge of a three-point revitalization plan, including building constituency organizations, engaging with members, and developing new policy. Party insiders also stated that a name change was likely for the party, since the &#x27;progressive&#x27; term had been &quot;usurped by liberal socialists&quot;.

In 2022, the party trust fund would again be at the centre of controversy. The party alleged that a group of political organizers had attempted a hostile takeover of the PCs, with a plan to rename the party the Saskatchewan Conservative Party and to install former Sask Party MLA Nadine Wilson as leader. The PCs reported that they rejected the attempted takeover, and that Wilson and the other organizers instead formed the Saskatchewan United Party. The PCs further alleged that Sask United organizers stole a hard drive containing member and donor information, a charge United organizers denied.

Ahead of the 2024 provincial election, Buscholl approached the far-right Buffalo Party to discuss a merger. On September 12, Buscholl announced that the PCs were calling off the merger discussions, citing Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;extensive focus on out-of-scope federal and international issues&quot; as a barrier. The party ultimately finished in fifth place for the fifth consecutive election, receiving approximately one percent of the vote province wide.

<doc id="474143" wikidata="Q1550356" url="?curid=474143" title="HMS Jaguar (F34)">
<text>HMS &quot;Jaguar&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. Commissioned in September 1939, she was present at the Dunkirk evacuation the following year, during which &quot;Jaguar&quot; was damaged by dive bombers. She later served in the Mediterranean and was involved in several actions there. She was torpedoed off the coast of Egypt on 26 March 1942 and sunk.

==Construction==
The eight ships of the J class were ordered on 25 March 1937, and &quot;Jaguar&quot; was laid down at the Dumbarton shipyard of Denny on 25 November 1937. She was launched on 22 November 1938 and commissioned on 12 September 1939.

&quot;Jaguar&quot; was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. Two Admiralty three-drum boilers fed steam at and to Parsons to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared-steam turbines, rated at . This gave a design speed of at trials displacement and at full load.

As completed, &quot;Jaguar&quot; had a main gun armament of six QF Mark XII guns in three twin mountings, two forward and one aft. These guns could only elevate to an angle of 40 degrees, and so were of limited use in the anti-aircraft role, while the aft mount was arranged so that it could fire forwards over the ship&#x27;s superstructure to maximise the forward firing firepower, but was therefore incapable of firing directly aft. A short range anti-aircraft armament of a four-barrelled 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft mount and eight .50 in machine guns in two quadruple mounts was fitted, while torpedo armament consisted of ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple mounts.

==Service==
===Home waters===
On commissioning, &quot;Jaguar&quot; joined the 7th Destroyer Flotilla based at Grimsby, operating off Britain&#x27;s east coast. On 11 October, the ship ran aground in the Firth of Forth and was under repair until November. She was refitted at the Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company&#x27;s Dundee yard from 15 March 1940 to 1 May that year, with leaks being rectified and her fuel tanks modified. On 20 May 1940, &quot;Jaguar&quot;, along with sister ships and and the corvette , escorted Naval trawlers as they cut the undersea telegraph cables between the UK and Borkum. 

On 26 May 1940, the Royal Navy set Operation Dynamo in motion, to rescue trapped British troops from Dunkirk and the surrounding area. On 27 May, &quot;Jaguar&quot;, together with &quot;Javelin&quot; and , was deployed to screen the evacuation operations from the North. On 28 May, &quot;Jaguar&quot; and other destroyers rescued survivors from the sinking of . &quot;Jaguar&quot; landed 370 troops picked up from the beaches of Bray-Dunes at Dover early on 29 May. Later that day she was ordered to embark troops from Dunkirk harbour. &quot;Jaguar&quot;, &quot;Grenade&quot; and were attacked by German dive bombers as they arrived at Dunkirk at about noon, with &quot;Gallant&quot; damaged by a near miss and forced to turn back.&quot;Jaguar&quot; and &quot;Grenade&quot; berthed side by side on the East Pier at Dunkirk. She embarked about 1000 troops before leaving the harbour at about 15:50 hr, when she was attacked by dive bombers and near missed by four bombs, which severed a steam pipe, which disabled her engines and knocking out her steering. She was towed clear of a wreck by the destroyer , which along with the coaster &quot;Rika&quot;, took off &quot;Jaguar&quot;″s troops. Later that day, &quot;Jaguar&quot; managed to restore power and returned to Dover under her own steam.

&quot;Jaguar&quot; was sent to the Humber for repair, returning to service on 23 June. On 1 September, she, together with &quot;Javelin&quot;, and , escorted the cruiser back to the Clyde after &quot;Fiji&quot; had been torpedoed west of the Hebrides. In October 1940 she was transferred to Portsmouth, and on 11 October, took part in Operation Medium, when the destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, including &quot;Jaguar&quot;, escorted the battleship during a bombardment of Cherbourg harbour. From 14 October to 1 November, &quot;Jaguar&quot; was refitted at Devonport, being fitted with degaussing coils.

===The Mediterranean===
On 23 November 1940, &quot;Jaguar&quot; joined Force H based at Gibraltar. On 27 November, she took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. In January 1941, the British carried out Operation Excess, an operation to run a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta and Piraus in Greece, while simultaneously running another convoy from Alexandria to Malta. &quot;Jaguar&quot; formed part of the close escort of the convoy running eastwards from Gibraltar. At dawn on 10 January, the Italian torpedo boats and attacked the convoy, launching seven torpedoes, all of which missed. Gunfire from the cruiser and the destroyers of the escort soon disabled &quot;Vega&quot;, and &quot;Jaguar&quot; closed to within of &quot;Vega&quot; and raked her with gunfire, setting the torpedo boat ablaze before the destroyer sank &quot;Vega&quot; with a torpedo. &quot;Jaguar&quot; fired 88 4.7 inch rounds and six 4-inch rounds during the engagement. When the operation was complete &quot;Jaguar&quot; joined the 14th Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet. In later February 1941 she took part in Operation Abstention, an attempt to capture the island of Kastelorizo in the Dodecanese from the Italians. The Italians rushed reinforcements to the island, forcing the British force to evacuate. &quot;Jaguar&quot; was covering the evacuation when she encountered the in the early hours of 27 February. After a brief exchange of fire between the two ships, &quot;Jaguar&quot;″s searchlight was hit by a round from &quot;Crispi&quot;, causing contact to be lost. That March she was at sea as part of Force D during the Battle of Cape Matapan.

On the night of 20/21 April 1941, &quot;Jaguar&quot; formed part of the escort for the battleships , and and the cruiser when they bombarded the port of Tripoli in Libya. On 23 April, &quot;Jaguar&quot; together with sister ships , and set out from Malta to intercept an Italian convoy on the way from Italy to Tripoli. The four destroyers engaged and sunk the Italian armed motor ship south of Lampedusa, but the convoy avoided the searching British ships. &quot;Jaguar&quot; took part in the Battle of Crete, delivering ammunition to British troops fighting on the island and escorting ships carrying out the evacuation from Crete. &quot;Jaguar&quot; was near missed by a bomb on 30 May. In June 1941, Britain launched an invasion of Vichy French Syria and Lebanon, and on 23 June, &quot;Jaguar&quot;, together with the cruisers , and the destroyers and , clashed with the , which was hit once but managed to escape.

After the end of the Syrian campaign, &quot;Jaguar&quot; operated out of Alexandria, duties including escorting supply convoys to besieged Tobruk, and shore bombardment duties off the coast of Libya. On 1 December 1941, her bridge was hit by a single 4.7 in shell accidentally fired by &quot;Jervis&quot; while the latter destroyer guns were being cleaned. Two men were killed, including &quot;Jaguar&quot;″s commanding officer. Later that month, &quot;Jaguar&quot; was deployed to Malta for operations against Italian convoys carrying supplies to North Africa. On the night of 18/19 December, three cruisers and four destroyers of Force K set out from Malta to intercept an Italian convoy, but ran into a minefield north of Tripoli, with the cruiser striking four mines and sinking, the cruisers and also striking mines. The destroyer struck a mine when trying to rescue survivors from &quot;Neptune&quot;, blowing her stern off. Early on 20 December, &quot;Jaguar&quot; found &quot;Kandahar&quot;, but the seas were too heavy for &quot;Jaguar&quot; to take &quot;Kandahar&quot; under tow, so after picking up 165 survivors from the stricken destroyer&#x27;s crew, &quot;Jaguar&quot; scuttled &quot;Kandahar&quot; with torpedoes.
&quot;Jaguar&quot; helped to escort convoy MF 2 into Malta on 7–8 January 1942. She left Malta later that month, and from 13 to 16 June escorted the Malta-bound three ship Convoy MW 9, but two of the merchant ships were sunk and the third damaged and forced to put into Tobruk. On 26 March 1942 &quot;Jaguar&quot; and the were escorting the tanker when &quot;Slavol&quot; was torpedoed by the German submarine and set on fire. &quot;Jaguar&quot; came alongside &quot;Salvol&quot; to rescue the oiler&#x27;s crew, but the destroyer was then struck by two more torpedoes from &quot;U-652&quot;. &quot;Jaguar&quot; broke into three parts and quickly sank off Sidi Barrani, Egypt, with the loss of 3 officers and 190 of her crew, including two from the Irish Republic which was neutral at the time. 8 officers and 45 crewmen were rescued by the South African naval whaler &quot;Klo&quot;.

<doc id="474145" wikidata="Q1564934" url="?curid=474145" title="HMS Jackal (F22)">
<text>HMS &quot;Jackal&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. Completed in 1939, &quot;Jackal&quot; served in the Norwegian campaign and the Dunkirk evacuation before being deployed to the Mediterranean in 1941. &quot;Jackal&quot; took part in the Battle of Crete, and was scuttled after being heavily damaged by German bombers on 12 May 1942.

==Construction and design==
HMS &quot;Jackal&quot; was ordered, along with the rest of the J class, on 25 May 1937, and was laid down by John Brown and Company, Limited, at Clydebank in Scotland on 24 September 1937, launched on 25 October 1938 and commissioned on 13 April 1939, the first of the J class to be completed.

As completed, &quot;Jackal&quot; had a main gun armament of six QF Mark XII guns in three twin mountings, two forward and one aft. These guns could only elevate to an angle of 40 degrees, and so were of limited use in the anti-aircraft role, while the aft mount was arranged so that it could fire forwards over the ship&#x27;s superstructure to maximise the forward firing firepower, but was therefore incapable of firing directly aft. A short range anti-aircraft armament of a four-barrelled 2 pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft mount and eight .50 in machine guns in two quadruple mounts was fitted, while torpedo armament consisted of ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple mounts.

In an attempt to strengthen its anti-aircraft armament, one of &quot;Jackal&quot;″s banks of torpedo tubes was removed in favour of a single 4 inch Mk V anti-aircraft gun, while four Oerlikon 20 mm cannon replaced the .50 in machine guns.

==Operational history==

===Home Fleet===
After commissioning and workup, &quot;Jackal&quot; joined the 7th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the 7th Flotilla moved to the Humber, Duties included carrying out anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort missions in the North Sea, English Channel and the Western Approaches. On 6 September 1939, &quot;Jackal&quot; and sister ships and escorted the Norwegian steamer SS &quot;Batavia&quot;, carrying the staff of the British embassy in Berlin across the North Sea from Rotterdam to the Tongue lightship in the Thames estuary. &quot;Jackal&quot; collided with &quot;Janus&quot; at Kirkwall in Orkney on 14 October 1939, and after repair operated off the east coast of Britain for the next few months. On 28 February 1940, &quot;Jackal&quot; was badly damaged in a collision with the Swedish merchant ship &quot;Storfors&quot; (which was sunk), and was under repair at Blyth Shipbuilding Company, Northumberland until April 1940.

When repaired, &quot;Jackal&quot; was deployed in support of Allied forces in the Norwegian campaign, escorting troopships and carrying out shore bombardments, before being transferred to Harwich, as part of the Nore Command, carrying out convoy escort and patrol operations. In July 1940, &quot;Jackal&quot; took part in the Dunkirk evacuation, patrolling to protect the evacuation ships. Following Dunkirk, &quot;Jackal&quot; returned to the routine of convoy escort and patrols. On 11 October &quot;Jackal&quot;, together with the battleship and the destroyers , , , , and , shelled Cherbourg harbour. On 29 November 1940, &quot;Jackal&quot;, &quot;Javelin&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, and &quot;Kashmir&quot; were deployed to try to intercept a sortie by the German destroyers &quot;Karl Galster&quot;, &quot;Hans Lody&quot; and &quot;Richard Beitzen&quot; that resulted in &quot;Jackal&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Javelin&quot;, commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten, being torpedoed and badly damaged.

===Mediterranean Fleet===
In April 1941, &quot;Jackal&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. In May 1941 &quot;Jackal&quot; formed part of the escort for Operation Tiger, a convoy carrying tanks from Gibraltar to Alexandria, before being detached to shell Benghazi together with , &quot;Kelvin&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot; on the night of 10/11 May, with &quot;Jackal&quot; being near missed (at a distance of ) by a bomb that failed to explode on 11 May. On 20 May, Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete, and &quot;Jackal&quot; sailed the next day for the region to intercept German attempts to carry out landings by sea. On 23 May, &quot;Jackal&quot;, &quot;Kelly&quot;, &quot;Kelvin&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot; were deployed to search for and attack German invasion forces, but were attacked by German dive bombers, with &quot;Kelly&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot; being sunk. &quot;Jackal&quot; evacuated troops from Heraklion and Sphakia on 28 and 31 May, with Allied forces on Crete surrendering on 1 July.

&quot;Jackal&quot; was next deployed in support of Operation Exporter, the Allied invasion of Vichy French controlled Syria and Lebanon. On 9 June, &quot;Jackal&quot; and &quot;Janus&quot; engaged the Vichy French destroyers and when the French ships attacked Australian ground forces. Both &quot;Jackal&quot; and &quot;Janus&quot; were hit by shells from the French ships, with &quot;Janus&quot; sustaining serious damage although &quot;Jackal&quot; sustained no casualties, before the French ships retired to port. On 4 July &quot;Jackal&quot; took part in bombardment operations off the coast of Syria.

In August 1941, the Royal Navy was tasked with the replacement of Australian and Indian troops in besieged Tobruk with fresh troops, with the operation being carried out on moonless nights by destroyers and fast minelayers. On the evening of 21 August, &quot;Jackal&quot;, and were carrying out a run when their fighter cover of Curtiss Tomahawks of No. 2 Squadron SAAF and Hawker Hurricanes of No. 1 Squadron SAAF were attacked by German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters, with one of each side&#x27;s aircraft being shot down and the pilot of the shot down Tomahawk being picked up by one of the destroyers. &quot;Jackal&quot; formed part of the escort of the battleship when the torpedoed and sank &quot;Barham&quot; on 25 November 1941, with &quot;Jackal&quot; helping to rescue survivors and unsuccessfully attempting to attack &quot;U-331&quot;. On 1 December 1941, &quot;Jackal&quot;, , &quot;Jaguar&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot; were ordered to intercept three Italian destroyers that were reported to be off Derna, Libya. The British destroyers failed to locate the Italian ships, and were attacked by three Italian SM.79 torpedo bombers. &quot;Jackal&quot; was hit on the stern by a torpedo, and was badly damaged, with her steering gear wrecked and her judder jammed. Two of the torpedo bombers were damaged by defensive fire from the destroyers, with one having to force land. and was under repair at Alexandria until April 1942.

===Loss===
On 10 May 1942, the 14th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of &quot;Jackal&quot;, &quot;Jervis&quot;, &quot;Kipling&quot; and set out from Alexandria to intercept an Italian convoy sailing from Italy to Benghazi. The flotilla was sighted by German reconnaissance aircraft on the afternoon of 11 May, and in accordance with orders, as surprise had been lost, the destroyer flotilla abandoned the attack and reversed course. A first wave of German bombers, eight Junkers Ju 88s of I/Lehrgeschwader 1 (I/LG 1) based at Heraklion on Crete, arrived at about 16:31 hrs, sinking HMS &quot;Lively&quot; with 3 direct hits. A second wave of nine Ju 88s and four Heinkel He 111s of II/LG 1 from Eleusis, Greece, attacked between 18:09 and 18:33, but caused no damage. A third wave, consisting of ten Ju 88s from I/LG 1, attacked at about 20:00 hrs. &quot;Kipling&quot; was quickly sunk by the attacks, while &quot;Jackal&quot; was severely damaged by the bomber flown by Gerhard Brenner, with one direct hit and three near misses. &quot;Jackal&quot; was taken under tow by &quot;Jervis&quot;, but was suffering from an extensive fire and progressive flooding, and the ship was abandoned on the morning of 12 May and scuttled by &quot;Jervis&quot; by torpedoing. Nine officers and men from &quot;Jackal&quot; were killed, while total losses from the three destroyers were 77 killed.

<text>HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot;, a of the Royal Navy, was named after the island of Jamaica, which was a British Crown Colony when she was built in the late 1930s. The light cruiser spent almost her entire wartime career on Arctic convoy duties, except for a deployment south for the landings in North Africa in November 1942. She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea in 1942 and the Battle of North Cape in 1943. &quot;Jamaica&quot; escorted several aircraft carriers in 1944 as they flew off airstrikes that attacked the in northern Norway. Late in the year she had an extensive refit to prepare her for service with the British Pacific Fleet, but the war ended before she reached the Pacific.

&quot;Jamaica&quot; spent the late 1940s in the Far East and on the North America and West Indies Station. When the Korean War began in 1950 she was ordered, in cooperation with the United States Navy, to bombard North Korean troops as they advanced down the eastern coast. The ship also provided fire support during the Inchon Landing later that year. &quot;Jamaica&quot; was refitted late in the year and returned to Great Britain in early 1951 where she was placed in .

She was recommissioned in 1954 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1955 &quot;Jamaica&quot; was used to play the cruiser in the film &quot;Battle of the River Plate&quot;, in company with her wartime partner as . In 1956 the ship participated in Operation Musketeer, the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt to seize control of the Suez Canal. &quot;Jamaica&quot; was paid off in 1958 and sold for scrap in 1960.

==Description==
The &quot;Fiji&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . &quot;Jamaica&quot; displaced at standard load. The ships were powered by four Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Fiji&quot; class carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 733 officers and men in peacetime and 900 during war.
The armament of the &quot;Fiji&quot;-class ships consisted of a dozen 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XXIII guns in four three-gun turrets, one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of eight 4-inch (102 mm) Mk XVI dual-purpose guns in four twin turrets. Close-range anti-aircraft defence was provided by two quadruple 2-pounder (40 mm) (&quot;pom-poms&quot;) AA gun mounts and ten single mounts for Oerlikon guns. They also carried two above-water triple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes.

The &quot;Fiji&quot; class lacked a full waterline armour belt. The sides of their boiler and engine rooms and the magazines were protected by of armour. The deck over the propulsion machinery spaces and magazines was reinforced to a thickness of . They carried an aircraft catapult and two Supermarine Sea Otter or Walrus seaplanes.

==History==
&quot;Jamaica&quot; was laid down on 28 April 1939 by Vickers-Armstrongs in Barrow-in-Furness, England as part of the 1938 Naval Programme and named for the British colony of Jamaica. The ship was launched on 16 November 1940 and completed on 29 June 1942. After working up, the ship provided distant cover to Convoy PQ 18 in September. She was assigned to the Centre Task Force of Operation Torch in early November and was unsuccessfully attacked by the Vichy French submarine . The Arctic convoys had been suspended at PQ 18, but were scheduled to resume on 15 December with Convoy JW 51A. &quot;Jamaica&quot; and , with several escorting destroyers, formed Force R under the command of Rear-Admiral Robert Burnett and were tasked to cover the convoy against any German surface ships. The convoy was not spotted by the Germans and arrived at the Kola Inlet without incident on 25 December.

===Battle of the Barents Sea===

Force R sailed from Kola on 27 December to rendezvous with Convoy JW 51B in the Norwegian Sea, but the convoy had been blown southwards by a major storm. Several of its ships had been separated during storm and they confused the radar of Force R&#x27;s ships as to the true location of the convoy. Thus Force R was north of the convoy on the morning of 31 December when the heavy cruiser attacked the convoy. &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; was first held at bay by the British destroyers , , and . Initially driven off, &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; returned, only to be engaged by Force R shortly before noon and was hit by three 6-inch shells from the cruisers. Two German destroyers, and , misidentified &quot;Sheffield&quot; as &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and attempted to form up on her. &quot;Sheffield&quot; sank &quot;Friedrich Eckoldt&quot; at a range of while &quot;Jamaica&quot; unsuccessfully engaged &quot;Richard Beitzen&quot;. Less than an hour later Force R spotted the pocket battleship &quot;Lutzow&quot; and &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and opened fire. Neither side scored any hits in the darkness before both sides turned away a few minutes later. Force R continued to track the German ships for several hours before they lost contact. Although the destroyer and the minesweeper were sunk by the Kriegsmarine, the convoy reached the Kola Inlet intact. Force R remained at sea to protect Convoy RA 51 that was returning to Great Britain until relieved by and .

&quot;Jamaica&quot; rejoined the Home Fleet at the beginning of 1943 and received six twin power-operated AA guns as well as four single guns some time during the year. During November she protected the convoys RA 53B, JW 54A, JW 54B and RA 54B, but was not engaged. On 15 December she was assigned to Force 2, the distant escort for Convoy JW 55A, with the battleship and four destroyers. Force 2 was commanded by Admiral Bruce Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of Home Fleet, in &quot;Duke of York&quot;. For the first time the British distant cover force escorted the convoy all the way to the Kola Inlet. Their passage was uneventful, and Force 2 sailed on 18 December to refuel at Iceland. Before he reached his destination, Admiral Fraser received Ultra information that a sortie by the was likely to attack Convoy JW 55B, which was already at sea.

===Battle of North Cape===
German aerial reconnaissance spotted the convoy on 22 December, and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, escorted by five destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, sailed on 25 December to intercept it. The resulting engagement became known as the Battle of North Cape. The Germans were spotted on the morning of 26 December and were engaged by the covering force that consisted of the cruisers , HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, and four destroyers. Meanwhile, HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; and HMS &quot;Duke of York&quot; approached from the south west, barring the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s path of retreat. The German battleship turned for her base at Altafjord in the early afternoon after two brief encounters with the British cruisers. She was spotted by &quot;Duke of York&quot;″s Type 273 radar at a range of and &quot;Duke of York&quot; opened fire half an hour later. &quot;Jamaica&quot; fired her first salvo a minute after, and hit &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; on her third broadside. She was forced to cease fire after 19 salvos as the German ship was faster in the heavy seas than the British ships and was opening up the range despite heavy damage from the British shells.

A shell from &quot;Duke of York&quot;″s last volley penetrated into &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s Number One boiler room and effectively destroyed it. This reduced the German ship&#x27;s speed sufficiently for the British destroyers to catch up and make four torpedo hits using a pincer attack. This slowed the ship again, so that &quot;Jamaica&quot; and &quot;Duke of York&quot; also caught up and opened fire at a range of . They hit the German ship continually, but she did not sink after 20 minutes of firing so &quot;Jamaica&quot; was ordered to torpedo her. Two torpedoes from her first volley of three missed and the third misfired, so the cruiser had to turn about to fire her other broadside of three, two of which appeared to hit. &quot;Belfast&quot; and the destroyers also fired torpedoes before &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; finally sank.

===Further convoys and the raids on the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;===
In February–March 1944, &quot;Jamaica&quot; served as part of the covering forces for Convoys JW 57, JW 58 and RA 58. She was detached from the latter to escort the aircraft carrier as she launched an air strike against the German battleship Tirpitz as part of Operation Tungsten. In July she formed part of the covering force for the carriers , and during an unsuccessful attack on the berthed in Kaafjord (Operation Mascot). &quot;Jamaica&quot; escorted the Convoys JW 59 and RA 59 in August–September before starting a major refit in October that lasted until April 1945. The ship&#x27;s &#x27;X&#x27; turret (third from the front) was removed and her light anti-aircraft suite now consisted of five quadruple and four single 2-pounder mounts, four single mounts for 40 mm Bofors guns, two twin-gun Oerlikon mounts and six single Oerlikons while her radar suite was modernized. On 6 June the cruiser conveyed King George VI and the Queen on a visit of the Channel Islands. &quot;Jamaica&quot; was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the East Indies Fleet in September and was later transferred to the 4th Cruiser Squadron. The ship was reassigned to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1948.

===Korean War===
Fighting between North and South Korea had broken out on 25 June 1950, whilst &quot;Jamaica&quot; was on passage to Japan. She, and her escort , were ordered to rendezvous with the American light cruiser off the east coast of Korea to bombard advancing North Korean troops. On 2 July a North Korean supply convoy was returning from Chumunjin when it was spotted by the Allied ships. The escorting motor torpedo boats and motor gun boats turned to fight, but three torpedo boats and both gun boats were sunk without inflicting any damage on the Allied ships. They resumed bombarding coastal targets. Six days later &quot;Jamaica&quot; was hit by a shell that killed six and wounded five. On 15 August the ship bombarded captured harbour facilities in Kunsan. The following month, &quot;Jamaica&quot; participated in the preparatory bombardment of the island of Wolmi-do before the main landing on 15 September. During the landing itself she supported the southern flank of the assault and she was tasked to support the 1st Marine Regiment afterwards. Two days after the landing &quot;Jamaica&quot; and the American heavy cruiser were attacked by a pair of Yakovlev piston-engined fighters at dawn. One aircraft succeeded in strafing the ship, killing one sailor, before it was shot down by the ship&#x27;s guns.

===Post-Korean War===
The ship was the flagship of the Reserve Fleet from May 1953 to 1954 when she was recommissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron, she was refitted in Chatham Dockyard from June 1955 and rejoined her squadron. From the end of 1955 until early 1956 she played the part of HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; in the film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;. The ship participated in Operation Musketeer in November 1956. The ship led the bombardment force covering the Royal Marine landings at Port Said, but she was not permitted to fire her main guns as the Cabinet had banned naval gunfire support by guns larger than . &quot;Jamaica&quot; was placed in reserve again in September 1958 after a port visit to Kiel. She was sold for scrap on 14 November 1960 and arrived at Arnott Young&#x27;s yards at Dalmuir on 20 December 1960 to begin demolition.

<text>HMS &quot;Janus&quot;, named after the Roman god, was a &quot;Javelin&quot; or J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was ordered from the Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited at Wallsend-on-Tyne as part of the 1936 Build Programme and laid down on 29 September 1937, launched on 10 November 1938 and commissioned on 5 August 1939.

==Service history==

===North Sea and Mediterranean duties===
Off Namsos, Norway, on 30 April 1940 the sloop was mistaken for a cruiser and was badly damaged by German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers and had to be sunk by &quot;Janus&quot;. &quot;Janus&quot; served in the North Sea until May 1940 and had participated in over 20 convoy duties in that time. From May 1940 &quot;Janus&quot; began Mediterranean duties with the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in Alexandria. She participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941, and in the action off Sfax in April 1941.

===Fate===
On 23 January 1944 &quot;Janus&quot; was struck by one Fritz X guided bomb dropped by a German He 111 torpedo bomber and sank off the Anzio beachhead in western Italy (according to another version, she was sunk by Henschel Hs 293 glider bomb or a conventional torpedo – see Fritz X article). It took a mere twenty minutes for &quot;Janus&quot; to sink. Of her crew only 80 survived, being rescued by and smaller craft. It was recorded that during her last duty &quot;Janus&quot; had laid down nearly 500 salvos of 4.7-inch shells in the first two days of the landings in support of allied troops.

&quot;Janus&quot;″s badge is still on display at the Selborne dry dock wall.

<doc id="474153" wikidata="Q1564957" url="?curid=474153" title="HMS Juno (F46)">
<text>HMS &quot;Juno&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Limited, at Govan in Scotland on 5 October 1937, launched on 8 December 1938 and commissioned on 25 August 1939. &quot;Juno&quot; participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941.

==Construction==
The eight ships of the J class were ordered on 25 March 1937, and &quot;Juno&quot; was laid down with the name &quot;Jamaica&quot; at Fairfield&#x27;s Govan shipyard on 5 October 1937. The ship was renamed &quot;Juno&quot; in September 1938 and was launched on 8 December 1938. The ship was completed on 25 August 1939, and was commissioned with the pennant number F46.

&quot;Juno&quot; was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and deep load. Two Admiralty three-drum boilers fed steam at and to Parsons to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared-steam turbines, rated at . This gave a design speed of at trials displacement and at full load.

As completed, &quot;Juno&quot; had a main gun armament of six QF Mark XII guns in three twin mountings, two forward and one aft. These guns could only elevate to an angle of 40 degrees, and so were of limited use in the anti-aircraft role, while the aft mount was arranged so that it could fire forwards over the ship&#x27;s superstructure to maximise the forward firing firepower, but was therefore incapable of firing directly aft. A short range anti-aircraft armament of a four-barrelled 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft mount and eight .50 in machine guns in two quadruple mounts was fitted, while torpedo armament consisted of ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple mounts. Anti-submarine armament consisted of two depth charge throwers and a single rack, with 20 depth charges carried, while the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear could also be carried.

===Modifications===
Early in the war, the aft 4.7-inch mount was modified to allow it to fire directly aft, while in mid-1941, the aft set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a single 4 inch (102 mm) Mk V anti-aircraft gun (although this gun was not provided with appropriate fire control and was therefore of limited use). Close-in armament was improved by replacing the .50 in machine guns with 4 single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.

==Service==
The initial work-up of the ship and her crew was interrupted by the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and on 6 September 1939, &quot;Juno&quot; and sister ships and escorted the Norwegian steamer SS &quot;Batavia&quot;, carrying the staff of the British embassy in Berlin across the North Sea from Rotterdam to the Tongue lightship in the Thames estuary. She then resumed training and work up activities based at Devonport for the remainder of September, joining the 7th Destroyer Flotilla based on the Humber and operating off the east coast of Britain, with duties including patrols and escorting convoys. On the night of 6/7 December 1939, &quot;Juno&quot; and were on patrol off Cromer when they encountered two German destroyers, &quot;Hans Lody&quot; and &quot;Erich Giese&quot;, returning from a minelaying sortie. &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;Jersey&quot; did not spot the two German ships, which launched 7 torpedoes, one of which hit &quot;Jersey&quot;. &quot;Juno&quot; in response, searched for a submarine, which was believed to have fired the torpedo, allowing the German destroyers to escape unchallenged. When it was realised that there was no submarine, &quot;Juno&quot; took &quot;Jersey&quot; under tow, taking the damaged destroyer to Immingham.

&quot;Juno&quot; continued in service with the 7th Flotilla until March 1940, with her service interrupted by a refit at Kingston upon Hull from 5 February to 2 March 1940 and by repairs to her feedwater tanks from 9 to 20 March. On 5 April 1940, &quot;Juno&quot; left Methil together with the destroyers , and as escort to the Norway-bound convoy ON.25. The convoy met up with the covering cruisers and on 7 April, but later that day, reports of German heavy warships at sea caused the convoy to return to Britain. The reported German ships were, in fact, part of the German fleet taking part in the German invasion of Norway. &quot;Juno&quot; operated with the Home Fleet through April 1940 in operations to oppose the invasion. On 17 April, &quot;Juno&quot;, together with &quot;Janus&quot;, and , escorted the cruiser as the cruiser shelled the airfield at Sola, Norway. The force came under heavy air attack, and &quot;Suffolk&quot; was hit by a bomb and badly damaged. On 23 April, &quot;Juno&quot; left Scapa Flow as part of the escort for the aircraft carriers and as the carriers provided air cover for landings at Åndalsnes and Namsos, the force returning to Scapa on 3 May. 

===Attacked and sunk===
&quot;Juno&quot; was attacked and sunk by five Italian CANT Z.1007 aircraft from 210th group, led by Lt. Mario Morassutti, as she steamed with the Mediterranean Fleet against the German sea-borne invasion of Crete and sank 30 nautical miles south-east of Crete on 21 May 1941.

At the time of her sinking &quot;Juno&quot; was commanded by Cdr. St. John Reginald Joseph Tyrwhitt and would have had a complement of 183 to 218 seamen and officers. It is believed that 116 crew lost their lives after 3 powerful explosions split &quot;Juno&quot; in two, sinking her in around 97 seconds.

<text>HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; was a J-class destroyer of the Royal Navy.

==Design==
As completed, &quot;Jupiter&quot; had a main gun armament of six QF Mark XII guns in three twin mountings, two forward and one aft. These guns could only elevate to an angle of 40 degrees, and so were of limited use in the anti-aircraft role, while the aft mount was arranged so that it could fire forwards over the ship&#x27;s superstructure to maximise the forward firing firepower, but was therefore incapable of firing directly aft. A short range anti-aircraft armament of a four-barrelled 2 pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft mount and eight .50 in machine guns in two quadruple mounts was fitted, while torpedo armament consisted of ten torpedo tubes in two quintuple mounts.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Jupiter&quot; was ordered, along with the rest of the J class, on 25 March 1937, and was laid down by Yarrow, Limited, at their Scotstoun, Glasgow shipyard on Clydebank in Scotland on 28 September 1937 and launched on 27 October 1938. She was commissioned on 22 June 1939, and was completed on 25 June 1939, at a cost of £389,511.

After commissioning, &quot;Jupiter&quot; underwent sea trials and worked up at Portland, with these activities being delayed by problems with the ship&#x27;s turbines that required repair at Devonport Dockyard. &quot;Jupiter&quot; completed trials on 1 September 1939, and joined the 7th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, based on the Humber, in time for the British declaration of war on 3 September 1939.

On 29 November 1941, &quot;Jupiter&quot; and the destroyer detached from the Mediterranean Fleet, joined up with Force G at Colombo, and the five ships sailed later that day. They rendezvoused with the battlecruiser at sea, and set course for Singapore, where they arrived on 2 December. They spent a few days there with shore leave and refit, while waiting for orders. On 1 December, it was announced that Sir Tom Phillips had been promoted to full Admiral, and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet. A few days later, &quot;Repulse&quot; started on a trip to Australia with the destroyers &quot;Vampire&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot;, but the force was recalled. It was not until nine days later that &quot;Tenedos&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; would join Phillips&#x27; Force Z in attacking the Japanese invasion force, and he himself would perish when both &quot;Repulse&quot; and the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; were bombed and sunk by Japanese land based bombers. During her campaign in the Pacific, &quot;Jupiter&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Norman V. J. T. Thew.

&quot;Jupiter&quot; sank the on 17 January 1942. On 27 February 1942 she struck a mine laid earlier in the day by the Dutch minelayer HNLMS &quot;Gouden Leeuw&quot; as she steamed with the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) cruiser force during the Battle of the Java Sea. The destroyer sank off the north Java coast in the Java Sea at 21:16 hours. Initially, the explosion was thought to have been caused by a Japanese torpedo. Most of her crew, totalling 97, were captured by Japanese forces, while 83 were rescued from the shore by submarine USS &quot;S-38&quot;. There were 84 dead or missing.

The wreck has been plotted, and is described by the Admiralty as &quot;very broken up, partly salvaged, and very close to the Java coast&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Kangaroo&quot; was a torpedo boat destroyer of the British Royal Navy. She served with the Dover Patrol in the First World War.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Kangaroo&quot; was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow-on-Tyne as Yard Number 787 on 29 December 1899 with work starting on speculation (i.e. without a specific order), but was purchased for the Royal Navy as part of the 1900–1901 shipbuilding programme. She was launched on 8 September 1900 and completed in July 1901.

&quot;Kangaroo&quot; was of similar design to , and , three &quot;Thirty-Knotter&quot; destroyers built by Palmers under the 1899–1900 programme. Like these ships, she was powered by triple-expansion steam engines fed by four Reed boilers and driving two propeller shafts. Four funnels were fitted, with the two middle funnels very closely spaced. The machinery was rated at , sufficient to propel the ship at her contract speed of .

Gun armament consisted of a single QF 12-pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun forward on a platform on the ship&#x27;s conning tower together with five 6-pounder guns. Two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes completed the ship&#x27;s armament.

==Service==
&quot;Kangaroo&quot; was commissioned in August 1901 by Lieutenant Charles Edward Whately Pyddoke for service on the Mediterranean Station. She visited Lemnos in August 1902, and the following month was part of a squadron visiting Nauplia and Souda Bay at Crete. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1905. Apart from this tour in the Mediterranean, &quot;Kangaroo&quot; spent most of her duty time in home waters. In 1906 &quot;Kangaroo&quot; was part of the First Destroyer Division. She was part of the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth between 1910 and 1912, and then joined the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla.

&quot;Kangaroo&quot; remained part of the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla, based at Dover for the duration of the First World War.

HMS &quot;Kangaroo&quot; was finally sold for scrap to M. Yates on 23 February 1920, but was resold to Thos. W. Ward and broken up at Milford Haven.

<text>HMS &quot;Kenya&quot; was a cruiser of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after Kenya, a British possession at the time of the ship&#x27;s construction.

==Service history==

===Construction and early service===
&quot;Kenya&quot; was launched on 18 August 1939 from the yards of Alexander Stephen and Sons, Glasgow, Scotland and after working up was commissioned on 27 September 1940. She took part in the hunt for the in May 1941 whilst part of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. On 3 June &quot;Kenya&quot; and the cruiser surprised and sank the German tanker &quot;Belchen&quot; which was supplying in the Davis Straits.

===Operation Stonewall===
During September and October 1941, the Royal Navy devised Operation Stonewall, to intercept U-boats which were escorting outbound blockade runners through the Bay of Biscay into the Atlantic. After providing escort to the Malta convoy Operation Halberd on 24 September on 1 October, &quot;Kenya&quot; and the cruiser made to intercept the blockade runner &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, destined for Japan and escorted by . &quot;Rio Grande&quot; escaped but another blockade runner, , was sunk on 3 October west of Cape Finisterre.

===Arctic operations===
New research into declassified State Department records on the Soviet Union has revealed that on 19 March 1942, &quot;Kenya&quot; transported 10 tons of gold from the Soviet Union to the United States as payment for loans and war materials.

&quot;Kenya&quot; also avoided damage in air attacks by the Germans on 27–28 March. She had by now received the nickname &quot;The Pink Lady&quot;, due to her Mountbatten Pink camouflage paint, during the commando raid against installations on Vågsøy Island off the Norwegian coast. This was attributed to her Mountbatten Pink camouflage blending in with the pink marker dye the Germans were using in their shells, preventing German spotters from distinguishing between shell splashes and the ship. The force returned to Scapa Flow in early January 1942. &quot;Kenya&quot; returned to escorting Arctic convoys between March and May 1942. On 22 March after escorting PQ12 to Murmansk &quot;Kenya&quot; was loaded with 10 tonnes of Russian bullion and took it back to Britain for safe keeping.

=== Operation Pedestal ===
&quot;Kenya&quot; played a prominent role in Operation Pedestal during August 1942. Pedestal was a Royal Navy operation to escort a convoy of 14 merchant ships through the western Mediterranean to relieve and resupply the besieged island of Malta. The convoy escort was the largest ever assembled in World War II, comprising 2 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers (Eagle, Victorious and Indomitable), 7 light cruisers (including &quot;Kenya&quot;) and 26 destroyers. Through 11 and 12 August, it successfully fought off massed air attacks by the German Luftwaffe and the Italian Regia Aeronautica, with the loss of only 1 merchant ship and 1 destroyer. The aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; was also lost to a lone submarine attack on 11 August.

The heavily mined waters between Sicily and Tunisia (the Narrows) made it too dangerous for the battleships and surviving aircraft carriers to escort the convoy all the way to Malta, and for the last , the escort comprised a smaller force (Force X) of cruisers and destroyers, including &quot;Kenya&quot;. During the night of 12 August and during the following day, the convoy was heavily attacked by Axis air forces, submarines and motor torpedo boats. During these actions, &quot;Kenya&#x27;s&quot; bow was blown off by a torpedo fired by the Italian submarine &quot;Alagi&quot;. This necessitated emergency shoring of the forward bulkhead and a reduced maximum speed of .

In all, a further two cruisers and eight merchant ships were lost in the night action of 12/13 August; Only &quot;Rochester Castle&quot;, &quot;Port Chalmers&quot;, &quot;Melbourne Star&quot;, &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; and the oil tanker &quot;Ohio&quot; made it to Grand Harbour Valletta, and &quot;Kenya&quot; was left as the most powerful surviving ship in Force X. After leading the surviving ships of the convoy to the safety of Malta&#x27;s fighter screen. &quot;Kenya&quot; then led Force X safely back to Gibraltar, despite further air attacks. 

===End of war===
&quot;Kenya&quot; joined the America and West Indies Station with the 8th Cruiser Squadron, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, in October 1946, but in December of the following year, she returned to the UK and was placed in the reserve. The cruiser had a comprehensive modernisation in 1945–1946 with new standardised, twin 40 mm light anti aircraft guns and updated surface and long-range early-warning radar and fire control for the anti-aircraft armament. She was reactivated to replace the cruiser on the Far East station, in 1949 after another extensive refit.

===Korean War===
&quot;Kenya&quot; took part in naval operations in the Korean War. In March she bombarded Choda Island in preparation for landing 200 Republic of Korea troops there. Unfortunately the troops never showed up.

After further patrols off Inchon her next action came on 11 April when she was ordered to leave Sasebo to search for a communist aircraft that had been shot down. She was called off the operation early to sail to Kure, Japan where Captain Podger took command of the ship on 22 April. In May she took position off Inchon and spent about 10 days there bombarding the land on several occasions. The patrols and bombardments continued throughout the summer – with a trip to Hong Kong that broke the monotony – until 25 August when she left Sasebo, via Hong Kong, for a refit at Singapore. She slipped the refit jetty on 12 November and rearmed before leaving the Far East Station on 17 November. Kenya docked in Malta on 10 December and at Gibraltar three days later before entering the English Channel on 16 December.

Following the war, &quot;Kenya&quot; had an extensive year long refit in 1945–1946 at Chatham with new radars and standarisation of the light anti-aircraft armament on 5 twin Mk5 Bofors and 8 single 40mm. &quot;Kenya&quot; saw service in the Korean War on shore bombardment duties. In 1953–1955 the vessel refitted and spent a long period in reserve until August 1955 when she reentered service as a replacement for the cruiser on the West Indian station. She paid off into reserve in August 1958, the ship was declared for disposal in February 1959 and was scrapped in 1962.

<doc id="474159" wikidata="Q2741364" url="?curid=474159" title="The Wretched of the Earth">
<text>The Wretched of the Earth () is a 1961 book by the philosopher Frantz Fanon, in which the author provides a psychoanalysis of the dehumanizing effects of colonization upon the individual and the nation, and discusses the broader social, cultural, and political implications of establishing a social movement for the decolonisation of a person and of a people. The French-language title derives from the opening lyrics of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which is reflected in the English title as well.

==Summary==
Through critiques of nationalism and of imperialism, Fanon presents a discussion of personal and societal mental health, a discussion of how the use of language (vocabulary) is applied to the establishment of imperialist identities, such as &quot;coloniser&quot; and &quot;colonised&quot;, to teach and psychologically mould the native and the colonist into their respective roles as &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;master&quot;, and a discussion of the role of the intellectual in a revolution. Fanon proposes that revolutionaries should seek the help of the lumpenproletariat to provide the force required to effect the expulsion of the colonists. In traditional Marxist theory, the lumpenproletariats are the lowest, most degraded stratum of the proletariat—especially criminals, vagrants and the unemployed—people who lack the class consciousness to participate in the socialist revolution.

Fanon applies the term &quot;lumpenproletariat&quot; to the colonial subjects who are not involved in industrial production, especially the peasantry, because, unlike the urban proletariat (the working class), the lumpenproletariat has sufficient intellectual independence from the dominant ideology of the colonial ruling class, ready to grasp that they can revolt against the colonial &quot;status quo&quot; and so decolonize their nation. One of the essays included in &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; is &quot;On National Culture&quot;, in which Fanon highlights the necessity for each generation to discover its mission and fight for it.

== &quot;On Violence&quot; ==
The first section is entitled &quot;On Violence&quot;. It is a detailed explanation of violence in relation to both the colonial world and the process of decolonization. Fanon begins with the premise that decolonization is, by definition, a violent process without exception. The object of that process is the eventual replacement of one group of humans with another, and that process is only complete when the transition is total. This conception of decolonization is based on Fanon&#x27;s construction of the colonial world. Through his observations, he concluded that all colonial structures are actually nested societies which are not complementary. He uses Aristotelian logic in that the colony followed the &quot;principle of reciprocal exclusivity&quot;. Based on this conclusion, Fanon characterizes the assessment of the native population by the settler class as dehumanizing. The settlers literally do not see the natives as members of the same species. The natives are incapable of ethics and thereby are the embodiment of absolute evil (p. 32) as opposed to the Christian settlers who are forces of good. This is a crucial point for Fanon because it explains two phenomena that occur in the colonial world. The first is the idea that decolonization is the replacement of one population by another, and the second is that since the native knows that they are not animals, they immediately develop a feeling of rebellion against the settler.

One of the temporary consequences of colonization that Fanon talks about is division of the native into three groups. The first is the native worker who is valued by the settler for their labor. The second group is what he calls the &quot;colonized intellectual&quot; (p. 47). These are, by western standards, the more educated members of the native group who are in many ways recruited by the settler to be spokespeople for their views. The settlers had &quot;implanted in the minds of the colonized intellectual that the essential qualities remain eternal in spite of the blunders men may make: the essential qualities of the West, of course&quot; (p. 36); these intellectuals were &quot;ready to defend the Graeco-Latin pedestal&quot; (p. 36) against all foes, settler or native. The third group described by Fanon are the lumpenproletariat. This group is described in Marxism as the poorest class; those who are outside of the system because they have so little. This group is often dismissed by Marxists as unable to assist in the organizing of the workers, but Fanon sees them differently. For him, the lumpenproletariat will be the first to discover violence in the face of the settler (p. 47).

Once the idea of revolution is accepted by the native, Fanon describes the process by which it is debated, adjusted, and finally implemented. According to Fanon, the revolution begins as an idea of total systematic change, and through the actual application to real world situations is watered down until it becomes a small shift of power within the existing system. &quot;[The] pacifists and legalists ... put bluntly enough the demand ... &#x27;Give us more power (46), but the &quot;native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world&quot; (47). The colonialist bourgeoisie offers non-violence and then compromise as further ways out of the violence of decolonization; these too are mechanisms to blunt and degrade the movement. An example of this is the newly independent Republic of Gabon which gained independence from France in 1960 and afterward, the new president, Léon M&#x27;ba said &quot;Gabon is independent, but between Gabon and France nothing has changed; everything goes on as before&quot; (quoted in &quot;Wretched of the Earth&quot;, p. 52). For Fanon, this is the perfect example of a decolonization movement which has been enfeebled by the tentativeness of its leaders. To fight this, &quot;The newly independent Third World countries are urged not to emulate the decadent societies of the West (or East), but to chart a new path in defining human and international relationship&quot; (Fairchild, 2010, p. 194).

In this essay Fanon describes many aspects of the violence and response to violence necessary for total decolonization. He also offers cautions about several different approaches to that violence.

== &quot;On National Culture&quot; ==

=== Summary ===
In the essay &quot;On National Culture&quot; published in &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, Fanon sets out to define how a national culture can emerge among the former and, at the time of its release in 1961, still-colonized nations of Africa. Rather than depending on an orientalized, fetishized understanding of precolonial history, Fanon argues a national culture should be built on the material resistance of a people against colonial domination. Fanon narrates the essay with reference to what he calls the &#x27;colonized intellectual&#x27;.

==== The return to precolonial history ====
For Fanon, colonizers attempt to write the precolonial history of a colonized people as one of &quot;barbarism, degradation, and bestiality&quot; in order to justify the supremacy of Western civilization. To upset the supremacy of the colonial society, writes Fanon, the colonized intellectual feels the need to return to their so-called &#x27;barbaric&#x27; culture, to prove its existence and its value in relation to the West.

Fanon suggests colonized intellectuals often fall into the trap of trying to prove the existence of a common African or &#x27;Negro&#x27; culture. This is a dead end, according to Fanon, because it was originally the colonists who essentialized all peoples in Africa as &#x27;Negro&#x27;, without considering distinct national cultures and histories. This points to what Fanon sees as one of the limitations of the Négritude movement. In articulating a continental identity, based on the colonial category of the &#x27;Negro&#x27;, Fanon argues &quot;the men who set out to embody it realized that every culture is first and foremost national&quot;.

An attempt among colonized intellectuals to &#x27;return&#x27; to the nation&#x27;s pre-colonial culture is then ultimately an unfruitful pursuit, according to Fanon. Rather than culture, the intellectual emphasizes traditions, costumes, and clichés, which romanticize history in a similar way as the colonist would. The desire to reconsider the nation&#x27;s pre-colonial history, even if it results in orientalized clichés, still marks an important turn according to Fanon, since by rejecting the normalized eurocentrism of colonial thought, these intellectuals provide a &quot;radical condemnation&quot; of the larger colonial enterprise. This radical condemnation attains its full meaning when we consider that the &quot;final aim of colonization&quot;, according to Fanon, &quot;was to convince the indigenous population that it would save them from darkness&quot;. A persistent refusal among Indigenous peoples to admonish national traditions in the face of colonial rule, according to Fanon, is a demonstration of nationhood, but one that holds on to a fixed idea of the nation as something of the past, a corpse.

==== Struggle as the site of national culture ====
Ultimately, Fanon argues the colonized intellectual will have to realize that a national culture is not a historical reality waiting to be uncovered in a return to pre-colonial history and tradition, but is already existing in the present national reality. National struggle and national culture then become inextricably linked in Fanon&#x27;s analysis. To struggle for national liberation is to struggle for the terrain whereby a culture can grow, since Fanon concludes a national culture cannot exist under conditions of colonial domination.

A decisive turn in the development of the colonized intellectual is when they stop addressing the oppressor in their work and begin addressing their own people. This often produces what Fanon calls &quot;combat literature&quot;, writing that calls upon the people to undertake the struggle against the colonial oppressor. This change is reflected in all modes of artistic expression among the colonized nation, from literature to pottery, to ceramics, and oral story-telling. Fanon specifically uses the example of Algerian storytellers changing the content and narration of their traditional stories to reflect the present moment of struggle against French colonial rule. He also considers the bebop jazz movement in America as a similar turn, whereby black jazz musicians began to delink themselves from the image imposed on them by a white-Southern imaginary. Whereas the common trope of African-American jazz musicians was, according to Fanon, &quot;an old &#x27;Negro&#x27;, five whiskeys under his belt, bemoaning his misfortune&quot;, bebop was full of energy and dynamism that resisted and undermined the common racist trope.

For Fanon, national culture is then intimately tied to the struggle for the nation itself, the act of living and engaging with the present reality that gives birth to the range of cultural productions. This might be best summarized in Fanon&#x27;s idea of replacing the &#x27;concept&#x27; with the &#x27;muscle&#x27;. Fanon is suggesting that the actual practice and exercise of decolonization, rather than decolonization as an academic pursuit, is what forms the basis of national culture.

==== Towards an international consciousness ====
In concluding the essay, Fanon is careful to point out that building a national culture is not an end in itself, but a &#x27;stage&#x27; toward larger international solidarity. The struggle for national culture induces a break from the inferior status that was imposed on the nation by the process of colonization, which in turn produces a &#x27;national consciousness&#x27;. This national consciousness, born of struggle undertaken by the people, represents the highest form of national culture, according to Fanon. Through this process, the liberated nation emerges as an equal player on the international stage, where an international consciousness can discover and advance a set of universalizing values.

==Reception==

In his preface to the 1961 edition of &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, Jean-Paul Sartre supported Frantz Fanon&#x27;s advocacy of violence by the colonized people against the colonizer, as necessary for their mental health and political liberation; Sartre later applied that introduction in &quot;Colonialism and Neocolonialism&quot; (1964), a politico–philosophic critique of France&#x27;s Algerian colonialism. The political focus derives from the first chapter of the book, &quot;On Violence&quot;, wherein Fanon indicts colonialism and its post-colonial legacies, for which violence is a means of catharsis and liberation from being a colonial subject.

In the foreword to the 2004 edition of &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, Homi K. Bhabha criticized Sartre&#x27;s introduction, stating that it limits the reader&#x27;s approach to the book to focus on its promotion of violent resistance to oppression. After 1967, in the wake of Sartre&#x27;s support for Israel in the Six-Day War, the introduction by Sartre was removed from new editions by Fanon&#x27;s widow, Josie. Interviewed in 1978 at Howard University, she said, &quot;when Israel declared war on the Arab countries, there was a great pro-Zionist movement in favor of Israel among western (French) intellectuals. Sartre took part in this movement. He signed petitions favoring Israel. I felt that his pro-Zionist attitudes were incompatible with Fanon&#x27;s work&quot;. Anthony Elliott writes that &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; is a &quot;seminal&quot; work.

Fanon&#x27;s writing on culture has inspired much of the contemporary postcolonial discussions on the role of the national culture in liberation struggles and decolonization. In particular, Robert J. C. Young partially credits Fanon for inspiring an interest about the way the individual human experience and cultural identity are produced in postcolonial writing. Fanon&#x27;s theorizing of national culture as first and foremost a struggle to overthrow colonial rule was a radical departure from other considerations of culture that took a more historical and ethnographic view.

=== Criticism ===

Some theorists working in postcolonial studies have criticized Fanon&#x27;s commitment to the nation as reflective of an essentialist and authoritarian tendency in his writing. In response to &quot;On National Culture&quot;, Christopher L. Miller, professor of African American studies and French at Yale University, faults Fanon for viewing the nation as the unquestioned site of anti-colonial resistance, since national borders were imposed on African peoples during the Scramble for Africa. According to Miller, the lack of attention to the imposition and artificiality of national borders in Africa overlooks the cultural and linguistic differences of each country that make theorizing a unified national culture, as Fanon does, problematic. Miller also criticizes Fanon for following much of &quot;post-Enlightenment Western thought&quot; by treating particular or local histories as subordinate to the universal or global struggle of the nation.

Neil Lazarus, professor at Warwick University, has suggested that Fanon&#x27;s &quot;On National Culture&quot; overemphasizes a sense of unified political consciousness onto the peasantry in their struggle to overthrow colonial systems of power. In particular, Lazarus argues that the idea of a &#x27;national consciousness&#x27; does not align with the history of the Algerian Revolution, in which Fanon was highly involved, since when the country gained independence in 1962 after an 8-year liberation war, the population was largely demobilized. In Lazarus&#x27; view, the peasant militancy in Fanon&#x27;s analysis becomes the exact justification for his theory, yet does not necessarily exist in the material sense.

In the foreword to the 2004 edition of &quot;Wretched of the Earth&quot;, Bhabha also pointed to some of the dangers of Fanon&#x27;s analysis in &quot;On National Culture&quot;. He wrote that Fanon&#x27;s dedication to a national consciousness can be read as a &quot;deeply troubling&quot; demand for cultural homogeneity and the collapse of difference. Bhabha, however, suggests Fanon&#x27;s vision is one of strategy and any focus on the homogeneity of the nation should not be interpreted as &quot;narrow-minded nationalism&quot;, but an attempt to break the imposed Cold War era binaries of capitalism vs. socialism or East vs. West.

=== Strategic essentialism ===

Some scholars have noted the similarities between Fanon&#x27;s conception of national culture and strategic essentialism. Strategic essentialism is a popular concept in postcolonial studies, which was coined by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak in the 1980s. The concept acknowledges the impossibility of defining a set of essential attributes to a group or identity, while also acknowledging the importance of some kind of essentialism in order to mobilize for political action. This resonates with Fanon&#x27;s argument in &#x27;On National Culture&#x27;, since any essentialism of national cultural identity was basically a strategic step towards overcoming the assimilation of colonialism, and building an international consciousness where binaries of colonized and colonizer were dissolved.

=== Relationship to the Négritude movement ===

&quot;On National Culture&quot; is also a notable reflection on Fanon&#x27;s complex history with the Négritude movement. Aimé Césaire, Fanon&#x27;s teacher and an important source of intellectual inspiration throughout his career, was the co-founder of the movement. While Fanon&#x27;s thinking often intersected with figures associated with Négritude, including a commitment to rid humanism of its racist elements and a general dedication to Pan-Africanism in various forms, &quot;On National Culture&quot; was rather critical of the Négritude movement especially considering its historical context. The last section of the essay was initially drafted as a speech for the Second Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Rome: &quot;The Unity and Responsibilities of African Negro Culture&quot; (1959). The problems and solutions presented by the congress, inspired as they were by the movement, often revolved around the presumption that a unified African Negro culture existed. Alioune Diop, speaking as one of the key figures of the movement at the conference, said Négritude intended to enliven black culture with qualities indigenous to African history, but made no mention of a material struggle or a nationalist dimension. Meanwhile, throughout the essay, Fanon stressed the cultural differences between African nations and the particular struggles black populations were facing, which required material resistance on a national level. In a portion of the essay written after he delivered the speech at the conference, Fanon was especially critical of prominent Négritude writers and politicians Jacques Rabemananjara and Léopold Sédar Senghor, who called for black cultural unity yet opposed Algeria&#x27;s bid for independence at the United Nations.

<text>Sven Erik Alf Sjöberg (21 June 1903 – 17 April 1980) was a Swedish theatre and film director. He won the Grand Prix du Festival at the Cannes Film Festival twice: in 1946 for &quot;Torment&quot; () (part of an eleven-way tie), and in 1951 for his film &quot;Miss Julie&quot; () (an adaptation of August Strindberg&#x27;s play which tied with Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;Miracle in Milan&quot;).

Despite his success with those films, Sjöberg was foremost a stage director, perhaps the greatest at the Royal Dramatic Theatre (alongside first Olof Molander and later Ingmar Bergman). He was a First Director of Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre between 1930 and 1980; he staged there many remarkable and historic productions. Sjöberg was also a pioneer director of drama for early Swedish TV (his 1955 TV production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a national milestone). At the 3rd Guldbagge Awards Sjöberg won the award for Best Director for the film &quot;Ön&quot;.

Sjöberg died in a car accident on his way to rehearsal at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.

<text>The iAPX 432 (&quot;Intel Advanced Performance Architecture&quot;) is a discontinued computer architecture introduced in 1981. It was Intel&#x27;s first 32-bit processor design. The main processor of the architecture, the &quot;general data processor&quot;, is implemented as a set of two separate integrated circuits, due to technical limitations at the time. Although some early 8086, 80186 and 80286-based systems and manuals also used the iAPX prefix for marketing reasons, the iAPX 432 and the 8086 processor lines are completely separate designs with completely different instruction sets.

The project started in 1975 as the 8800 (after the 8008 and the 8080) and was intended to be Intel&#x27;s major design for the 1980s. Unlike the 8086, which was designed the following year as a successor to the 8080, the iAPX 432 was a radical departure from Intel&#x27;s previous designs meant for a different market niche, and completely unrelated to the 8080 or x86 product lines.

The iAPX 432 project is considered a commercial failure for Intel, and was discontinued in 1986.

==Description==
The iAPX 432 was referred to as a &quot;micromainframe&quot;, designed to be programmed entirely in high-level languages. The instruction set architecture was also entirely new and a significant departure from Intel&#x27;s previous 8008 and 8080 processors as the iAPX 432 programming model is a stack machine with no visible general-purpose registers. It supports object-oriented programming, garbage collection and multitasking as well as more conventional memory management directly in hardware and microcode. Direct support for various data structures is also intended to allow modern operating systems to be implemented using far less program code than for ordinary processors. Intel iMAX 432 is a discontinued operating system for the 432, written entirely in Ada, and Ada was also the intended primary language for application programming. In some aspects, it may be seen as a high-level language computer architecture.

These properties and features resulted in a hardware and microcode design that was more complex than most processors of the era, especially microprocessors. However, internal and external buses are (mostly) not wider than 16-bit, and, just like in other 32-bit microprocessors of the era (such as the 68000 or the 32016), 32-bit arithmetical instructions are implemented by a 16-bit ALU, via random logic and microcode or other kinds of sequential logic. The iAPX 432 enlarged address space over the 8080 was also limited by the fact that &quot;linear addressing&quot; of data could still only use 16-bit offsets, somewhat akin to Intel&#x27;s first 8086-based designs, including the contemporary 80286 (the new 32-bit segment offsets of the 80386 architecture was described publicly in detail in 1984).

Using the semiconductor technology of its day, Intel&#x27;s engineers weren&#x27;t able to translate the design into a very efficient first implementation. Along with the lack of optimization in a premature Ada compiler, this contributed to rather slow but expensive computer systems, performing typical benchmarks at roughly 1/4 the speed of the new 80286 chip at the same clock frequency (in early 1982). This initial performance gap to the rather low-profile and low-priced 8086 line was probably the main reason why Intel&#x27;s plan to replace the latter (later known as x86) with the iAPX 432 failed. Although engineers saw ways to improve a next generation design, the iAPX 432 &quot;capability architecture&quot; had now started to be regarded more as an implementation overhead rather than as the simplifying support it was intended to be.

Originally designed for clock frequencies of up to 10 MHz, actual devices sold were specified for maximum clock speeds of 4 MHz, 5 MHz, 7 MHz and 8 MHz with a peak performance of 2 million instructions per second at 8 MHz.

==History==

===Development===
Intel&#x27;s 432 project started in 1976, a year after the 8-bit Intel 8080 was completed and a year before their 16-bit 8086 project began. The 432 project was initially named the 8800, as their next step beyond the existing Intel 8008 and 8080 microprocessors. This became a very big step. The instruction sets of these 8-bit processors were not very well fitted for typical Algol-like compiled languages. However, the major problem was their small native addressing ranges, just 16 KB for 8008 and 64 KB for 8080, far too small for many complex software systems without using some kind of bank switching, memory segmentation, or similar mechanism (which was built into the 8086, a few years later on). Intel now aimed to build a sophisticated complete system in a few LSI chips, that was functionally equal to or better than the best 32-bit minicomputers and mainframes requiring entire cabinets of older chips. This system would support multiprocessors, modular expansion, fault tolerance, advanced operating systems, advanced programming languages, very large applications, ultra reliability, and ultra security. Its architecture would address the needs of Intel&#x27;s customers for a decade.

The iAPX 432 development team was managed by Bill Lattin, with Justin Rattner (who would later become CTO of Intel) as the lead engineer (although one source states that Fred Pollack was the lead engineer). Initially the team worked from Santa Clara, but in March 1977 Lattin and his team of 17 engineers moved to Intel&#x27;s new site in Portland. Pollack later specialized in superscalarity and became the lead architect of the i686 chip Intel Pentium Pro.

It soon became clear that it would take several years and many engineers to design all this. And it would similarly take several years of further progress in Moore&#x27;s Law, before improved chip manufacturing could fit all this into a few dense chips. Meanwhile, Intel urgently needed a simpler interim product to meet the immediate competition from Motorola, Zilog, and National Semiconductor. So Intel began a rushed project to design the 8086 as a low-risk incremental evolution from the 8080, using a separate design team. The mass-market 8086 shipped in 1978.

The 8086 was designed to be backward-compatible with the 8080 in the sense that 8080 assembly language could be mapped on to the 8086 architecture using a special assembler. Existing 8080 assembly source code (albeit no executable code) was thereby made upward compatible with the new 8086 to a degree. In contrast, the 432 had no software compatibility or migration requirements. The architects had total freedom to do a novel design from scratch, using whatever techniques they guessed would be best for large-scale systems and software. They applied fashionable computer science concepts from universities, particularly capability machines, object-oriented programming, high-level CISC machines, Ada, and densely encoded instructions. This ambitious mix of novel features made the chip larger and more complex. The chip&#x27;s complexity limited the clock speed and lengthened the design schedule.

The core of the design — the main processor — was termed the General Data Processor (GDP) and built as two integrated circuits: one (the 43201) to fetch and decode instructions, the other (the 43202) to execute them. Most systems would also include the 43203 Interface Processor (IP) which operated as a channel controller for I/O, and an Attached Processor (AP), a conventional Intel 8086 which provided &quot;processing power in the I/O subsystem&quot;.

These were some of the largest designs of the era. The two-chip GDP had a combined count of approximately 97,000 transistors while the single chip IP had approximately 49,000. By comparison, the Motorola 68000 (introduced in 1979) had approximately 40,000 transistors.

In 1983, Intel released two additional integrated circuits for the iAPX 432 Interconnect Architecture: the 43204 Bus Interface Unit (BIU) and 43205 Memory Control Unit (MCU). These chips allowed for nearly glueless multiprocessor systems with up to 63 nodes.

===The project&#x27;s failures===
Some of the innovative features of the iAPX 432 were detrimental to good performance. In many cases, the iAPX 432 had a significantly slower instruction throughput than conventional microprocessors of the era, such as the National Semiconductor 32016, Motorola 68010 and Intel 80286. One problem was that the two-chip implementation of the GDP limited it to the speed of the motherboard&#x27;s electrical wiring. A larger issue was the capability architecture needed large associative caches to run efficiently, but the chips had no room left for that. The instruction set also used bit-aligned variable-length instructions instead of the usual semi-fixed byte or word-aligned formats used in the majority of computer designs. Instruction decoding was therefore more complex than in other designs. Although this did not hamper performance in itself, it used additional transistors (mainly for a large barrel shifter) in a design that was already lacking space and transistors for caches, wider buses and other performance oriented features. In addition, the BIU was designed to support fault-tolerant systems, and in doing so up to 40% of the bus time was held up in wait states.

Another major problem was its immature and untuned Ada compiler. It used high-cost object-oriented instructions in every case, instead of the faster scalar instructions where it would have made sense to do so. For instance the iAPX 432 included a very expensive inter-module procedure call instruction, which the compiler used for all calls, despite the existence of much faster branch and link instructions. Another very slow call was enter_environment, which set up the memory protection. The compiler ran this for every single variable in the system, even when variables were used inside an existing environment and did not have to be checked. To make matters worse, data passed to and from procedures was always passed by value-return rather than by reference. When running the Dhrystone benchmark, parameter passing took ten times longer than all other computations combined.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;the i432 ran 5 to 10 times more slowly than its competitor, the Motorola 68000&quot;.

===Impact and similar designs===
The iAPX 432 was one of the first systems to implement the new IEEE-754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.

An outcome of the failure of the 432 was that microprocessor designers concluded that object support in the chip leads to a complex design that will invariably run slowly, and the 432 was often cited as a counter-example by proponents of RISC designs. However, some hold that the OO support was not the primary problem with the 432, and that the implementation shortcomings (especially in the compiler) mentioned above would have made any CPU design slow. Since the iAPX 432 there has been only one other attempt at a similar design, the Rekursiv processor, although the INMOS Transputer&#x27;s process support was similar — and very fast. 

Intel had spent considerable time, money, and mindshare on the 432, had a skilled team devoted to it, and was unwilling to abandon it entirely after its failure in the marketplace. A new architect—Glenford Myers—was brought in to produce an entirely new architecture and implementation for the core processor, which would be built in a joint Intel/Siemens project (later BiiN), resulting in the i960-series processors. The i960 RISC subset became popular for a time in the embedded processor market, but the high-end 960MC and the tagged-memory 960MX were marketed only for military applications.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Intel&#x27;s collaboration with HP on the Merced processor (later known as Itanium) was the company&#x27;s comeback attempt for the very high-end market.

==Architecture==
The iAPX 432 instructions have variable length, between 6 and 321 bits. Unusually, they are not byte-aligned, that is, they may contain odd numbers of bits and directly follow each other without regard to byte boundaries. 

===Object-oriented memory and capabilities===
The iAPX 432 has hardware and microcode support for object-oriented programming and capability-based addressing. The system uses segmented memory, with up to 224 segments of up to 64 KB each, providing a total virtual address space of 240 bytes. The physical address space is 224 bytes (16 MB).

Programs are not able to reference data or instructions by address; instead they must specify a segment and an offset within the segment. Segments are referenced by &quot;access descriptors (ADs)&quot;, which provide an index into the system object table and a set of rights (capabilities) governing accesses to that segment. Segments may be &quot;access segments&quot;, which can only contain Access Descriptors, or &quot;data segments&quot; which cannot contain ADs. The hardware and microcode rigidly enforce the distinction between data and access segments, and will not allow software to treat data as access descriptors, or vice versa.

System-defined objects consist of either a single access segment, or an access segment and a data segment. System-defined segments contain data or access descriptors for system-defined data at designated offsets, though the operating system or user software may extend these with additional data. Each system object has a type field which is checked by microcode, such that a Port Object cannot be used where a Carrier Object is needed. User programs can define new object types which will get the full benefit of the hardware type checking, through the use of &quot;type control objects (TCOs)&quot;.

In Release 1 of the iAPX 432 architecture, a system-defined object typically consisted of an access segment, and optionally (depending on the object type) a data segment specified by an access descriptor at a fixed offset within the access segment.

By Release 3 of the architecture, in order to improve performance, access segments and data segments were combined into single segments of up to 128 kB, split into an access part and a data part of 0–64 KB each. This reduced the number of object table lookups dramatically, and doubled the maximum virtual address space.

The iAPX432 recognizes fourteen types of predefined &quot;system objects&quot;:
* instruction object contains executable instructions
* domain object represents a program module and contains references to subroutines and data
* context object represents the context of a process in execution
* type-definition object represents a software-defined object type
* type-control object represents type-specific privilege
* object table identifies the system&#x27;s collection of active object descriptors
* storage resource object represents a free storage pool
* physical storage object identifies free storage blocks in memory
* storage claim object limits storage that may be allocated by all associated storage resource objects
* process object identifies a running process
* port object represents a port and message queue for interprocess communication
* carrier Carriers carry messages to and from ports
* processor contains state information for one processor in the system
* processor communication object is used for interprocessor communication

===Garbage collection===
Software running on the 432 does not need to explicitly deallocate objects that are no longer needed. Instead, the microcode implements part of the marking portion of Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s on-the-fly parallel garbage collection algorithm (a mark-and-sweep style collector). The entries in the system object table contain the bits used to mark each object as being white, black, or grey as needed by the collector. The iMAX 432 operating system includes the software portion of the garbage collector.

===Instruction format===
Executable instructions are contained within a system &quot;instruction object&quot;. Due to instructions being bit-aligned, a 16-bit &quot;bit&quot; displacement into the instruction object allows the object to contain up to 65,536 bits (8,192 bytes) of instructions.

Instructions consist of an &quot;operator&quot;, consisting of a &quot;class&quot; and an &quot;opcode&quot;, and zero to three &quot;operand references&quot;. &quot;The fields are organized to present information to the processor in the sequence required for decoding&quot;. More frequently used operators are encoded using fewer bits. The instruction begins with the 4 or 6 bit class field which indicates the number of operands, called the &quot;order&quot; of the instruction, and the length of each operand. This is optionally followed by a 0 to 4 bit &quot;format&quot; field which describes the operands (if there are no operands the format is not present). Then come zero to three operands, as described by the format. The instruction is terminated by the 0 to 5 bit opcode, if any (some classes contain only one instruction and therefore have no opcode). &quot;The Format field permits the GDP to appear to the programmer as a zero-, one-, two-, or three-address architecture.&quot; The format field indicates that an operand is a data reference, or the top or next-to-top element of the operand stack.

<text>Giovanni Amelino-Camelia (born 14 December 1965, Naples) is an Italian physicist of the University of Naples Federico II who works on quantum gravity.

He is the first proposer of doubly special relativity, that is the idea of introducing the Planck length in physics as an observer-independent quantity, obtaining a relativistic theory (like Galileian relativity and Einstein&#x27;s special relativity). The principles of doubly special relativity probably imply the loss of the notion of classical (Riemannian) spacetime; this led Amelino-Camelia to the study of non-commutative geometry as a feasible theory of quantum spacetime.
Amelino-Camelia is the initiator of &quot;quantum-gravity phenomenology&quot;, for being the first to show that with some experiments under reach of current technology sensitivity to Planck-scale effects is feasible (see Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope).

<text>The Mercury News (formerly San Jose Mercury News, often locally known as &quot;The Merc&quot;) is a morning daily newspaper published in San Jose, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is published by the Bay Area News Group, a subsidiary of Media News Group which in turn is controlled by Alden Global Capital, a vulture fund. , it was the fifth largest daily newspaper in the United States, with a daily circulation of 611,194. , the paper has a circulation of 324,500 daily and 415,200 on Sundays. this further declined. The Bay Area News Group no longer reports its circulation, but rather &quot;readership&quot;. For 2021, they reported a &quot;readership&quot; of 312,700 adults daily.

First published in 1851, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; is the last remaining English-language daily newspaper covering the Santa Clara Valley. It became the &quot;Mercury News&quot; in 1983 after a series of mergers. During much of the 20th century, it was owned by Knight Ridder. Because of its location in Silicon Valley, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; has covered many of the key events in the history of computing, and was a pioneer in delivering news online. It was the first American newspaper to publish in three languages (English, Spanish, and Vietnamese).

==Name==
The paper&#x27;s name derives from the &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot; and &quot;San Jose News&quot;, two daily newspapers that merged to form the &quot;Mercury News&quot;.

The &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot;″s name was a play on words. The word &quot;mercury&quot; refers to the importance of the mercury industry during the California Gold Rush. At the time, the nearby New Almaden mine (now Almaden Quicksilver County Park) was North America&#x27;s largest producer of mercury, which was needed for hydraulic gold mining. In addition, Mercury is the Roman messenger of the gods as well as the god of commerce and thieves, known for his swiftness, so the name &quot;Mercury&quot; is commonly used for newspapers without the quicksilver association.

==Coverage==
The paper&#x27;s local coverage and circulation is concentrated in Santa Clara County and San Mateo County. With the &quot;Mercury News&quot;, &quot;East Bay Times&quot;, &quot;Marin Independent Journal&quot;, and &quot;Silicon Valley Community Newspapers&quot;, the Bay Area News Group covers much of the San Francisco Bay Area with the notable exception of San Francisco itself.

The &quot;Mercury News&quot;″s predecessor, the &quot;Weekly Visitor&quot;, began as a Whig paper in the early 1850s but quickly switched its affiliation to the Democratic Party. The paper remained a conservative voice through the mid 20th century, when it supported pro-growth city leaders and pursued a staunchly pro-growth, anti-union agenda. It became considerably more moderate in the 1970s, reflecting new ownership and changes to the local political landscape. It endorsed John B. Anderson for president in 1980 and endorsed Democratic presidential candidates in every election from 1992 through 2016.

==History==
===Early history===
The newspaper now known as the &quot;Mercury News&quot; began in 1851 or 1852. California legislators had just moved the state capital from San Jose to Vallejo, leading to the failure of San Jose&#x27;s first two newspapers, the &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;State Journal&quot;. A group of three businessmen led by John C. Emerson bought the papers&#x27; presses to found the &quot;San Jose Weekly Visitor&quot;. The &quot;Weekly Visitor&quot; began as a Whig paper but quickly switched its affiliation to the Democratic Party. It was renamed the &quot;Santa Clara Register&quot; in 1852. The following year, Francis B. Murdoch took over the paper, merging it into the &quot;San Jose Telegraph&quot;. W. A. Slocum assumed control of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in 1860 and merged it with the &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot; or &quot;Weekly Mercury&quot; to become the &quot;Telegraph and Mercury&quot;. William N. Slocum soon dropped &quot;Telegraph&quot; from the name. By this point, the &quot;Mercury&quot; was one of two newspapers publishing in San Jose.

===Owen ownership===
James Jerome Owen – a forty-niner and former Republican New York assemblyman – became the &quot;Mercury&quot;″s publisher in the spring of 1861, later acquiring a controlling interest in the paper along with a partner, Benjamin H. Cottle. The paper published daily as the &quot;San Jose Daily Mercury&quot; for three months in the fall of 1861, then from August 1869 to April 1870 with the addition of J. J. Conmy as partner and again from March 11, 1872, after the purchase of the &quot;Daily Guide&quot;. In 1878, Owen formed the Mercury Printing and Publishing Company.

In 1881, Owen proposed to light San Jose with a moonlight tower. The San Jose electric light tower was dedicated that year. The &quot;Mercury&quot; boasted that San Jose was the first town west of the Rocky Mountains lighted by electricity.

The &quot;Mercury&quot; merged with the Times Publishing Company, which was owned by Charles M. Shortridge, in 1884. The &quot;Daily Morning Times&quot; and &quot;Daily Mercury&quot; briefly became the &quot;Times-Mercury&quot;, while the &quot;Weekly Times&quot; and &quot;Weekly Mercury&quot; briefly become the &quot;Times-Weekly Mercury&quot;. In 1885, both publications adopted the &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot; name. That year, Owen sold his interest in the paper and moved to San Francisco.

===Hayes ownership===
In late 1900, Everis A. Hayes and his brother Jay purchased the &quot;Mercury&quot;. In August 1901, they purchased the &quot;San Jose Daily Herald&quot;, an evening paper, and formed the Mercury Herald Company. In 1913, the two papers were consolidated into a single morning paper, the &quot;San Jose Mercury Herald&quot;.

In 1942, the Mercury Herald Company purchased the &quot;San Jose News&quot; (which was founded in 1851) but continued to publish both papers, the &quot;Mercury Herald&quot; in the morning and the &quot;News&quot; in the evening, with a combined Sunday edition called the &quot;Mercury Herald News&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; name was dropped in 1950.

===Ridder ownership===
Herman Ridder&#x27;s Northwest Publications (later Ridder Publications) purchased the &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;News&quot; in 1952. During the mid 20th century, the papers took largely conservative, pro-growth positions. Publisher Joe Ridder was a vocal proponent of San Jose City Manager A. P. Hamann&#x27;s development agenda, which emphasized urban sprawl within an ever-expanding city limits. Ridder counted on increasing population to lead to increased newspaper subscriptions and advertising sales. The paper supported a series of general obligation bonds worth $ (equivalent to $ in ), most of it spent on capital improvements that benefited real estate developers. It also supported a revision to the city charter that introduced a direct mayoral elections and abolished the vote of confidence for city manager. By 1967, the &quot;Mercury&quot; had risen to rank among the top six largest morning newspapers in the country by circulation, boosted by unabated growth into the suburbs, while the &quot;News&quot; ran the most advertising of any evening newspaper in the country.

In February 1967, the &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;News&quot; moved from a cramped former grocery store in downtown San Jose to a campus in suburban North San Jose. A main building could contain more presses to serve a booming population. The newly built complex cost $ (equivalent to $ in ) and was called the largest one-story newspaper plant in the world. Civic leaders criticized the move as emblematic of the urban decay that downtown San Jose was experiencing.

===Knight Ridder ownership===
In 1974, Ridder merged with Knight Newspapers to form Knight Ridder. Joe Ridder was forced to retire in 1977. His nephew, P. Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Ridder, succeeded him as publisher. Tony Ridder placed an emphasis on improving the papers&#x27; reportage, to better reflect Knight&#x27;s reputation for investigative journalism.

After the merger, the papers moderated their formerly staunch pro-growth agenda, and coverage of local issues became more balanced. The editorial board expressed only minimal opposition to a 1978 measure that abolished at-large city council elections, seen as favorable to deep-pocketed developers, in favor of council districts. It supported the desegregation of San Jose Unified School District and in 1978 argued against Proposition 13. In the 1980s, Ridder supported Mayor Tom McEnery&#x27;s efforts to redevelop the downtown area, including the construction of San Jose Arena and The Tech Museum of Innovation.

In 1983, the &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;News&quot; merged into a single seven-day paper, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, with separate morning and afternoon editions. The afternoon edition was discontinued in 1995, leaving only the morning edition.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; published &quot;West&quot; magazine as a Sunday insert.

====Coverage of ethnic communities====
In the 1990s, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; expanded its coverage of the area&#x27;s ethnic communities, to national acclaim, hiring Vietnamese-speaking reporters for the first time. In 1994, it became the first of two American dailies to open a foreign bureau in Vietnam after the Vietnam War. A foreign correspondent stationed at the Hanoi bureau held an annual town hall meeting with the Vietnamese-American community in San Jose. Initially, community members staged protests accusing the paper of siding with the Communist government in Vietnam by opening the bureau.

The &quot;Mercury News&quot; launched the free, Spanish-language weekly (New World) in 1996 and the free, Vietnamese-language weekly &quot;Viet Mercury&quot; in 1999. &quot;Viet Mercury&quot; was the first Vietnamese-language newspaper published by an English-language daily. It competed against a crowded field of 14 Vietnamese-owned community newspapers, including four dailies.

====Growth alongside the technology industry====
The &quot;Mercury News&quot; benefited from its status as the major daily newspaper in Silicon Valley during the dot-com bubble. It led the news industry in business coverage of the valley&#x27;s high-tech industry, attracting readers from around the world. &quot;Time&quot; called the &quot;Mercury News&quot; the most technologically savvy newspaper in the country. The tech industry&#x27;s growth fueled growth in the paper&#x27;s classified advertising, particularly for employment listings. For 20 years, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; was one of the country&#x27;s top newspapers in the amount of advertising it ran.

The &quot;Mercury News&quot; was one of the first daily newspapers in the United States to have an online presence, and was the first to deliver full content and breaking news online. It launched a service called Mercury Center on America Online in 1993, followed by the country&#x27;s first news website in 1995 (see ). Mercury Center shut down its AOL service in July 1996, leaving only the website.

At its peak in 2001, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; had 400 employees in its newsroom, 15 bureaus, $288 million in annual revenue, and profit margins above 30%. In 1998, Knight Ridder moved its headquarters from Miami to the Knight-Ridder Building in San Jose, which was seen as an acknowledgment of the central role that online news would play in the company&#x27;s future. Mercury Center ended its paywall in May 1998, after posting 1.2  million monthly unique visitors the previous year. By 2000, the paper had a Sunday circulation of 327,000 and $341 million in annual revenue, $118 million of it from job listings. In 2001, circulation rose to 289,413 daily and 332,669 Sundays.

====Flush times come to an end====
The collapse of the dot-com bubble impacted the classified advertising that sustained the newspaper&#x27;s business operations. Additionally, newspapers across the industry faced serious competition to their job listings from websites such as Monster.com, CareerBuilder, and Craigslist.

Cost-cutting began affecting the initiatives the paper had started in the 1990s. In June 2005, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; closed its Hanoi bureau. On October 21, it also announced the closure of and the sale of &quot;Viet Mercury&quot; to a group of Vietnamese-American businessmen; however, the deal fell through, and &quot;Viet Mercury&quot; published its final issue on November 11, 2005.

===Digital First ownership===
On March 13, 2006, The McClatchy Company purchased Knight Ridder for $. In a surprise move, McClatchy immediately put the &quot;Mercury News&quot; and 11 other newspapers back up for sale. On April 26, Denver-based MediaNews Group (now Digital First Media) announced a planned $ purchase of the &quot;Mercury News&quot;, two other California newspapers, and the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, with the three California papers to be added to the California Newspapers Partnership (CNP). However, on June 12, 2006, federal regulators from the U.S. Department of Justice asked for more time to review the purchase, citing possible antitrust concerns over MediaNews&#x27; ownership of other newspapers in the region.

Although approval by regulators and completion of MediaNews&#x27; acquisition was announced on August 2, 2006, a lawsuit claiming antitrust violations by MediaNews and the Hearst Corporation had also been filed in July 2006. The suit, which sought to undo the purchase of both the &quot;Mercury News&quot; and the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;, was scheduled to go to trial on April 30, 2007. While extending until that date a preliminary injunction that prevented the collaboration of local distribution and national advertising sales by the two media conglomerates, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston on December 19, 2006, expressed doubt over the legality of the purchase. On April 25, 2007, days before the trial was scheduled to begin, the parties reached a settlement in which MediaNews preserved its acquisitions. The &quot;Mercury News&quot; and &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; were placed under CNP&#x27;s local subsidiary, the Bay Area News Group. Meanwhile, layoffs continued at the &quot;Mercury News&quot;. Around December 2016, 101 employees were laid off, including 40 in the newsroom.

In 2013, MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media merged to form Digital First Media. In April 2013, MediaNews announced that it would sell the &quot;Mercury News&quot; campus on Ridder Park Drive in North San Jose. County Supervisor Dave Cortese approached the &quot;Mercury News&quot; about moving into the former San Jose City Hall on North First Street, but the paper ended up returning downtown. In June 2014, printing and production of the &quot;Mercury News&quot; and other daily newspapers moved to Bay Area News Group&#x27;s Concord and Hayward facilities. The &quot;Mercury News&quot; moved into a downtown office building that September. According to the publishers, the Ridder Park Drive facility had become unnecessarily large for the paper, following the departure of printing operations and other staff reductions that had occurred over the years.

On April 5, 2016, Bay Area News Group consolidated the &quot;San Mateo County Times&quot; and 14 other titles into the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;. The paper&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;The Mercury News&quot;.

==Facilities==
The &quot;Mercury News&quot; is the largest tenant in the Towers @ 2nd high-rise office complex in downtown San Jose. Business functions occupy the seventh floor of 4 North Second Street, while news staff and executives occupy the eighth floor, for a total of . Printing and production of the &quot;Mercury News&quot; take place at the Bay Area News Group&#x27;s facilities in Concord and Hayward in the East Bay.

Originally, the &quot;Mercury&quot; and &quot;News&quot; published from various locations in downtown San Jose. From February 1967 to September 2014, the papers were headquartered in a campus in suburban North San Jose, abutting the Nimitz Freeway (then State Route 17, now Interstate 880). The Web staff was originally co-located with the newsroom staff but moved to downtown San Jose in December 1996. Following the &quot;Mercury News&quot;″ return to the downtown area, Digital First Media sold the suburban campus to Super Micro Computer, Inc., which renamed it &quot;Supermicro Green Computing Park&quot;.

Older &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; newsboxes have black, white, and green stripes, while newer &quot;Mercury News&quot; newsboxes bear the paper&#x27;s logo in white against a blue background.

==Online presence==
The &quot;Mercury News&quot; operates a paywalled website, which is located at mercurynews.com, sjmercury.com, or sjmn.com. Its SiliconValley.com website focuses on the technology industry in Silicon Valley. It also publishes a morning e-mail newsletter, Good Morning Silicon Valley, that covers technology news. &quot;Mercury News&quot; and &quot;e-Edition&quot; applications are available for Android and iOS devices, as well as for the Kindle Fire and Barnes &amp; Noble Nook.

The &quot;Mercury News&quot; was one of the first daily newspapers in the United States to have an online presence and was the first to deliver full content and breaking news online. In 1990, editor Robert Ingle sent a report to Tony Ridder, then the head of Knight Ridder, on the company&#x27;s future in electronic media after the failure of Viewtron four years earlier. Ingle proposed a Mercury Center online service that would use the newspaper&#x27;s content to bring together communities of interest. It launched as part of America Online on May 10, 1993, at AOL keyword . It was the second news service on AOL, after the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opened Chicago Online in 1992.

The paper sent floppy disks to subscribers for accessing Mercury Center. The service featured a large amount of content for free: the print paper&#x27;s full content, supplementary material such as documents and audio clips, stock quotes, and about 200 stories that did not make the print edition. A forum enabled readers to converse with each other and give feedback to reporters. However, the service&#x27;s most popular content lie behind a paywall: back issues from 1985 onward and a &quot;NewsHound&quot; clipping service were popular with business users. Readers could enter alphanumeric codes, which appeared throughout the print paper, to quickly access online versions of articles that did not make print. Examples included for an article in the news section or for a press release in the business section. The Mercury Center staff comprised both news reporters and business &quot;senders&quot;, who posted press releases online in addition to vetted content.

Initially, the service had difficulty attracting users, prompting the paper to add a telephone and fax hotline, News Call, in November 1993. By early 1994, Mercury Center had added 5,100 subscribers to AOL, representing less than 20% of AOL&#x27;s 30,000 subscribers in the San Francisco Bay Area or less than two percent of the &quot;Mercury News&quot;″s 282,488 daily subscribers.

In December 1994, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; began beta-testing a companion website, Mercury Center Web, which on January 20, 1995, became the country&#x27;s first news website. Subscribers no longer needed AOL to access the &quot;Mercury News&quot;″s online content, and the paper no longer had to share advertising revenue with AOL. The site ran on Netscape&#x27;s Netsuite Web server, with connectivity provided by Netcom. Access to the site cost $4.95 per month, with a discount for print subscribers. In October 1995, CareerBuilder.com launched as a partnership between the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Mercury News&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Mercury Center shut down its AOL service in July 1996, leaving only the website.

In August 1996, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; published &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;, a series of investigative articles by reporter Gary Webb that claimed CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking (see ). The &quot;Mercury News&quot; promoted the upcoming series on Usenet newsgroups weeks in advance. Mercury Center published reporting and supporting material online simultaneously with the print edition. The robust online production drew significant national attention to the series. Within days, more than 2,500 websites linked to Mercury Center&#x27;s &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; section, and the site received 100,000 daily page views over the usual traffic for weeks. Executive editor Jerome Ceppos eventually distanced the paper from the series, but it continued to receive attention, especially from online conspiracy theorists.

On October 26, 1999, technology columnist Dan Gillmor began writing a blog, &quot;eJournal&quot;, on the &quot;Mercury News&quot;″ SiliconValley.com website. It is believed to have been the first blog by a journalist at a traditional media company. In the 2000s, he was joined by columnists-turned-bloggers Tim Kawakami and John Paczkowski.

Articles dating back to June 1985 can be found online for free on the &quot;Mercury News&quot; website, with full text available on the NewsLibrary and NewsBank subscription databases. NewsBank also hosts the full text of articles from 1886 to 1922. The San José Public Library&#x27;s website hosts thousands of news clips of articles from 1920 to 1979. Much of Gillmor&#x27;s &quot;eJournal&quot; is preserved on the Bayosphere website.

==Awards==
The newspaper has earned several awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes, one in 1986 for reporting regarding political corruption in the Ferdinand Marcos administration in the Philippines, and one in 1990 for their comprehensive coverage of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Assistant managing editor David Yarnold was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2004 for a local corruption investigation. The Mercury News was also named one of the five best-designed newspapers in the world by the Society for News Design for work done in 2001. In 2007 the newspaper won a Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Award for General Excellence, Class IV.

Various staff writers and designers have received awards for their contributions to &quot;West&quot; magazine, a Sunday insert published by the &quot;Mercury News&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s.

The &quot;Mercury News&quot; website received EPpy Awards in 1996, 1999, 2009, 2013, and 2014.

==Controversies==
In August 1996, the &quot;Mercury News&quot; published &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;, a series of investigative articles by reporter Gary Webb. The series claimed that members of the Nicaraguan Contras, a right wing guerrilla group organized with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency, had been involved in smuggling cocaine into America to support their struggle, and as a result, had played a major role in creating the crack-cocaine epidemic of the 1980s. The series sparked three federal investigations, but other newspapers such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; later published articles alleging that the series&#x27; claims were overstated. Executive editor Jerry Ceppos, who had approved the series, eventually published a column that suggested shortcomings in the series&#x27; reporting, editing, and production, while maintaining the story was correct &quot;on many important points&quot;. The series was turned into a 1998 book by the same name, also by Webb, and an account of the controversy surrounding the series was published as &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; in 2006. Both were the basis for the 2014 film &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;.

<text>Laurent Freidel is a French theoretical physicist and mathematical physicist known mainly for his contributions to quantum gravity, including loop quantum gravity, spin foam models, doubly special relativity, group field theory, relative locality and most recently metastring theory. He is currently a faculty member at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Freidel received his PhD in 1994 from the École normale supérieure de Lyon (ENSL) in Lyon, France. He stayed at ENSL officially as a research scientist for 12 years, until 2006. During that time he also held a postdoctoral position at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania, United States from 1997 to 1999 and an adjunct professor position at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada from 2002 to 2009. In 2006 he joined Perimeter Institute as its ninth faculty member.

Between 2004 and 2006 Freidel has coauthored a series of papers on the Ponzano-Regge model, a spin foam model of 3-dimensional quantum gravity. In 2007 he introduced, with Kirill Krasnov, a new spin foam model for 4-dimensional quantum gravity which has become known as the Freidel-Krasnov model.

In 2011 Freidel published a paper with Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman and Lee Smolin introducing the principle of relative locality, a proposed generalization of the principle of relativity in which different observers see different notions of spacetimes. Between 2013 and 2015 he published a series of papers with Robert Leigh and Djordje Minic introducing a new formulation of string theory, &quot;metastring theory&quot;, which implements the notion of relative locality in a precise way and introduces a new notion of &quot;modular spacetime&quot;.

<text>Use Your Illusion II is the fourth studio album by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses. The album was released on September 17, 1991, the same day as its counterpart &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;. Both albums were released in conjunction with the Use Your Illusion Tour. Bolstered by the lead single &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; was the slightly more popular of the two albums, selling a record 770,000 copies its first week and debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, ahead of &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;&#x27;s first-week sales of 685,000. As of 2010, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; has sold 5,587,000 units in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Both albums have since been certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for a single week.

It is the last Guns N&#x27; Roses studio album to credit rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. It also includes &quot;Civil War&quot;, the last track to feature drummer Steven Adler in any capacity. This album, along with &quot;Use Your Illusion I,&quot; was the last Guns N&#x27; Roses album to feature new original material until 2008&#x27;s album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;.

==Overview==
The &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums were a stylistic turning point for Guns N&#x27; Roses (see &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;). In addition, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; is more political than most of their previous work, with songs like &quot;Civil War&quot;, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, and &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; dealing respectively with the topics of violence, law enforcement and media bias. The thematic material deals less with drug use than previous Guns N&#x27; Roses albums. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; featured several songs pre-&quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; while &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; featured more tracks written during and after &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.

The band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; had been released almost a year earlier on the &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; soundtrack, while &quot;Civil War&quot; debuted at the 1990 Farm Aid concert. That concert also featured Guns N&#x27; Roses playing a cover of the U.K. Subs song &quot;Down on the Farm&quot;, a studio version of which would later appear on the band&#x27;s 1993 release of cover songs, &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;. &quot;Civil War&quot; was released as a B-side to &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;. The song had also been released on the charity album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child: Romanian Angel Appeal&quot;, a fund-raising compilation for Romanian orphans.

&quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The song was not released on the actual soundtrack. The band also filmed a video featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in character as the Terminator, with a loose plot featuring Axl Rose as its &quot;target&quot;. However, he is saved from termination as he is deemed a &quot;waste of ammo&quot; by the T-800&#x27;s lock-on system. The original subject matter of the song dealt with Izzy Stradlin&#x27;s failed relationship with ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti.

The &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums can be considered a single cohesive work, and certain elements of &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; underscore this intent. For instance, both albums have a version of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, and both have one cover song; &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; by Paul McCartney (&quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;) and &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot; by Bob Dylan (&quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;). Each also has at least one track sung by other members of the band: lead vocals are performed by bassist Duff McKagan on &quot;So Fine&quot;, a song that was dedicated to punk rock musician Johnny Thunders, who died from a drug overdose before the recording of the album.

The song &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; finds the band lashing out at a career&#x27;s worth of critics and enemies. Among those referred to by name are editors of several entertainment magazines. The industrial-flavored &quot;My World&quot;, the final track, was written and recorded in three hours, with Rose claiming those in the recording room were on mushrooms at the time.

The band had some difficulty achieving the final sound, especially during the mixing stages of both albums. According to a 1991 cover story by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, after mixing 21 tracks with engineer/producer Bob Clearmountain, the band fired Clearmountain when he tried to replace the real drums with samples. According to Slash&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;one afternoon we discovered a notepad of his where he&#x27;d notated all the drum samples he planned to mix in over Matt&#x27;s drum tracks&quot; the band decided to scrap the mixes and start from scratch with engineer Bill Price of Sex Pistols fame.

Slash has stated that most of the material for the album was written on acoustic guitars in a couple of nights at his house (the Walnut House), after several months of non-productivity. According to Slash &quot;Breakdown&quot; was one of the most complicated songs to record on the album; the banjo, drum, and piano parts were hard to synchronize and drummer Matt Sorum &quot;lost it&quot; a couple of times trying to get the drums just right. The song &quot;Locomotive&quot; was written in a house Slash and Izzy Stradlin rented in the Hollywood Hills following the &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; tours. The song shows the group dabbling in funk metal, and is also the only song on either album where the phrase &quot;use your illusion&quot; appears as a lyric.

==Artwork==
Both albums&#x27; covers are the work of Estonian-American artist Mark Kostabi. They consist of detail from Raphael&#x27;s painting &quot;The School of Athens&quot;. The highlighted figure, unlike many of those in the painting, has not been identified with any specific philosopher. The only difference in the artwork between the albums is the color scheme used for each album. &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; uses blue and purple. The original painting was titled by Paul Kostabi as &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; and also became the title of both albums. Both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums&#x27; liner notes include the message &quot;Fuck You, St. Louis!&quot; amongst the thank you notes, a reference to the Riverport Riot near there at the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre in July 1991 during the Use Your Illusion Tour.

==Reception==
&quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; received positive reviews, though some critics rated it lower than &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Christian Wright wrote that the album&#x27;s songs &quot;range from ballad to battle, pretty to vulgar, worldly to incredibly naive&quot;, concluding that Rose &quot;whips victimization, menace and struggle into one fluid, triumphant motion.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented that both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums &quot;represent a staggering leap in ambition, musicianship, production and songwriting&quot; and &quot;rank with the best hard rock of the last decade&quot;, while also finding that &quot;II&quot; contains more &quot;knockout punches&quot; than &quot;I&quot;. Although deeming &quot;I&quot; the better record, &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Edna Gundersen called &quot;II&quot; similarly &quot;rebellious, ambitious and powerful&quot;. In &quot;NME&quot;, Mary Anne Hobbs panned both albums for their &quot;dreadfully laboured feel&quot; and &quot;asinine&quot; lyrics; as examples of the latter, she cited the &quot;gratuitous sexism&quot; of &quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; and &quot;slack political rhetoric&quot; of &quot;Civil War&quot;. Robert Christgau was unimpressed by &quot;II&quot; apart from &quot;Civil War&quot;, which he designated as a &quot;choice cut&quot; in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; as &quot;more serious and ambitious than &quot;I&quot;, but... also considerably more pretentious&quot;, finding it a tedious listen due to its &quot;pompous production and poor pacing&quot; despite commending the &quot;nervy energy&quot; of certain songs. Ann Powers was more complimentary in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, calling it &quot;spacier&quot; than &quot;I&quot; while noting that &quot;Yesterdays&quot; and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; show that Guns N&#x27; Roses &quot;can still focus to great effect&quot;. Both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; records were jointly ranked 41st on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of the best albums of the 1990s.

It was the first time that two albums by one band or artist had entered the US charts at the number one and two spots and Guns N&#x27; Roses became the first to have the top two biggest selling albums on the chart since Jim Croce in 1974. The albums also opened as the top two albums on the charts in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

<text>Rodolfo Gambini (born 11 May 1946) is a physicist and professor of the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo, Uruguay and a visiting professor at the Horace Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Louisiana State University.

He works on loop quantum gravity. He got his PhD in Université de Paris VI working with Achilles Papapetrou. From there he moved to the Universidad Simón Bolívar in Venezuela where he rose through the professorial ranks. It was there that together with fellow physicist Antoni Trías he invented the loop representation for Yang-Mills theories in 1986.

Gambini returned to Uruguay in 1987 after democracy had returned to the country. Gambini has published over 100 scientific articles ranging from philosophy of science and foundations of quantum mechanics to lattice gauge theories to quantum gravity. He was head of the Pedeciba, the main funding agency for basic sciences in Uruguay (2003–2008). He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for Advancement of Science, a member of the Third World Academy of Sciences, the Latin American Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Exact and Natural Sciences of Argentina. He is the 2003 winner of the Third World Academy of Sciences prize in physics and has received numerous distinctions in Uruguay. In particular he was awarded the 2004 Presidential Medal of Science, the Prize to the Intellectual Work in 2011 and made an honorary doctorate of the University of the Republic in 2010.

In recent years he has studied issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, having developed the Montevideo Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. He also found the exact solution of the quantum Einstein equations in loop quantum gravity for vacuum spherically symmetric space-times, which resolves the singularity inside black holes.

Gambini is a recipient of the 2003 TWAS Prize.

<text>Christopher Isham (; born 28 April 1944), usually cited as Chris J. Isham, is a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London. 

==Research==
Isham&#x27;s main research interests are quantum gravity and foundational studies in quantum theory. He was the inventor of an approach to temporal quantum logic called the HPO formalism, and has worked on loop quantum gravity and quantum geometrodynamics. Together with other physicists, such as John C. Baez, Isham is known as a proponent of the utility of category theory in theoretical physics. In recent years, since at least 1997, he has been working on a new approach to quantum theory based on topos theory.

Isham has appeared in several &quot;NOVA&quot; television programmes as well as a film about Stephen Hawking. Physicist Paul Davies has described Isham as &quot;Britain&#x27;s greatest quantum gravity expert&quot;. As a practising Christian, Isham has also written about the relationships among philosophy, theology, and physics.

<text>Timothy Warren Anglin (August 31, 1822 – May 4, 1896) was a Canadian politician who served as the 2nd speaker of the House of Commons.

== Biography ==
Born in Clonakilty, County Cork, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Anglin emigrated at the age of 26 as part of the exodus caused by the Great Famine. Following a sectarian riot in New Brunswick between members of the Orange Order and Catholics, Anglin appealed for moderation and unity. This led him to take up the editorship of a new newspaper, &quot;The Freeman&quot;, in 1849, which made him an influential voice in the colony. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1861, and became an opponent of Canadian Confederation and of the government of Samuel Leonard Tilley which he helped defeat in 1865. Tilley returned to power the next year, however, with the defeat of the Anti-Confederation Party in the election. Anglin lost his own seat.

New Brunswick entered Confederation as a province in 1867 and Anglin won a seat in the new House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Gloucester in the country&#x27;s first general election.

When the Liberals came to power in the 1874 election, the new Prime Minister of Canada, Alexander Mackenzie, nominated Anglin as speaker of the House of Commons.

Anglin&#x27;s term as Speaker was controversial. The Speaker is expected to act in a non-partisan manner and be above politics, but Anglin used his rulings as Speaker as opportunities to enter into partisan debate. Even more troubling to the opposition was that he retained his position as editor of a partisan newspaper during his term as Speaker, and used his position to write editorials berating the Opposition. Especially controversial was that his newspaper was given government printing contracts. Anglin was accused of violating the &quot;Independence of Parliament Act&quot; for accepting government printing contracts, and was censured by the House of Commons Committee on Privilege in 1877. Anglin was forced to resign as Speaker and as an MP, but was re-elected to the House of Commons in the by-election that was held to fill his seat. He was successfully renominated by Mackenzie to the position of Speaker.

Anglin&#x27;s period as Speaker ended with the 1878 election that defeated the Liberal government. He remained in the House of Commons until he lost his seat in the 1882 election. Following his defeat, Anglin moved to Toronto and became editor of the &quot;Toronto Tribune&quot;. In the 1887 election, he was defeated in his bid to win a seat from the Ontario riding of Simcoe North.

Three of Anglin&#x27;s nine children were notably successful; Francis Alexander Anglin was Chief Justice of Canada from 1924 to 1933, Arthur Whyte Anglin was a successful lawyer in private practice, and Mary Margaret Anglin became the first internationally renowned Canadian stage actress.

<doc id="474199" wikidata="Q1780536" url="?curid=474199" title="Capture of Hill 60 (Western Front)">
<text>The Capture of Hill 60 () took place near Hill 60 south of Ypres on the Western Front, during the First World War. Hill 60 had been captured by the German 30th Division on 11 November 1914, during the First Battle of Ypres (19 October – 22 November 1914). Initial French preparations to raid the hill were continued by the British 28th Division, which took over the line in February 1915 and then by the 5th Division. The plan was expanded into an ambitious attempt to capture the hill, despite advice that Hill 60 could not be held unless the nearby Caterpillar ridge was also occupied. It was found that Hill 60 was the only place in the area not waterlogged and a French mine gallery was extended.

Experienced miners from Northumberland and Wales were recruited for the digging and the British attack began on 17 April 1915. The hill was captured quickly with only seven casualties but then it was found that the salient which had been created, made occupation of the hill costly. Both sides mistakenly accused the other of using poison gas in the April fighting; German attacks on the hill in early May included the use of gas shells and the Germans recovered the ground at the second attempt on 5 May. It remained in German hands until the Battle of Messines in 1917, when two of the Mines in the Battle of Messines were detonated beneath Hill 60 and the Caterpillar.
==Background==

===Topography===

The ground south of Zillebeke rises for to a ridge between Zwarteleen and Zandvoorde. Roads ran north-west to south-east through the area from Ypres to Verbrandenmoelen and Hollebeke and from Zillebeke to Zwartelen and Zandvoorde. The Ypres–Comines railway ran roughly parallel to the roads from Ypres and from Zillebeke, went through a cutting deep, which extended beyond the crest of the ridge. Earth excavated when the railway was built had been dumped on either side, to form small hillocks. Two were on the west side, one a long irregular mound atop the ridge called the Caterpillar and a smaller mound down the slope towards Zillebeke, known as the Dump. On the east side of the cutting, on the highest point of the ridge, was a third mound known as Hill 60, from which observers had an excellent view of the ground around Zillebeke and Ypres.

===Strategic developments===
Hill 60 was a spoil heap long and high, made from the diggings of a cutting for the Ypres–Comines railway. The hill was a low rise on the crest of Ypres ridge, at the southern flank of the Ypres Salient and was named after the contour which marked its boundary. The hill had been captured on 11 November 1914, by the German 30th Division, during fighting against a mixed force of French and British infantry and cavalry, in the First Battle of Ypres. Observation from the hill towards Ypres and Zillebeke was coveted by both sides, for the duration of the war. Hill 60 and the vicinity were held by Saxon Infantry Regiment 105 of the 30th Division, which with the 39th Division formed XV Corps of the 4th Army, at the time of the British attack.

===Tactical developments===

The German Imperial Army was a military force drawn from the kingdoms of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Baden and Württemberg. During wartime, the federal contingents retained their identity and some independence from the Prussian Army; in matters of manpower and maintenance of the order of battle, the non-Prussian contingents kept their autonomy. The Saxon and Württemberg armies were the smallest and when the XXVIII Reserve Corps was formed, both armies contributed units, which after the XIX Corps, became the second Saxon corps in the 4th Army. The attempt to prevent the national contingents from being taken over by the Prussian army had the unfortunate result that the corps was affected by tensions between the two contingents, the Württembergers tending to denigrate the ability of Saxon units. Infantry Regiment 105, a Saxon regiment in the Prussian 30th Division, relieved Infantry Regiment 132 at Hill 60 on 16 December 1914 and then took over Hill 69 and Zwarteleen by 21 December. On 29 December the French sprung a mine, which killed three soldiers and wounded twelve. During the new year, French artillery-fire increased and on 27 January the French detonated another mine near Zwarteleen; on 3 February the Saxons noticed that the troops opposite were British.

==Prelude==

===British preparations===
In the first British operation of its kind, Royal Engineer tunnelling companies laid six mines by 10 April 1915, an operation planned by Major-General Edward Bulfin, commander of the 28th Division and continued by the 5th Division when the 28th Division was relieved. The 173rd Tunnelling Company began work early in March and three tunnels were begun towards the German line, about away, a pit first having been dug some deep. By the time the work was finished, the tunnels stretched more than . Two mines in the north were charged with of explosives each, two mines in the centre had charges and in the south one mine was packed with of guncotton, although work on it had been stopped when it ran close to a German tunnel. The locality was photographed from the air, which revealed German gun emplacements and entrenchments. On 16 April, British artillery was ranged by air observers onto the approaches to Hill 60, ready for the attack. British infantry began to assemble after dark and 1 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was made responsible for keeping German aircraft away from the area.

==Attack==

===17–18 April===
On 17 April at the first pair of mines were blown and the rest ten seconds later. Débris was flung almost into the air and scattered for in all directions, causing some casualties to the attacking battalions of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division. The German garrison was overwhelmed, a platoon of Saxon Infantry Regiment 105 (SIR 105) in the front line being killed, the men of the garrison capable of resistance were bayoneted and twenty Germans were taken prisoner for seven British casualties. An attempt to counter-attack was made by the 2nd Company, SIR 105 but the attack lacked liaison with the flanking companies, since the mine explosion led to the approaches being open to view by the British. Some of the survivors of the 2nd Company ran back in fear that German gas cylinders, earlier placed in the front line, had been ruptured. The British began to consolidate and by had dug two communication trenches to connect the new positions to the old front line.

German artillery-fire gradually increased on the hill, after falling around it for some time and at around four companies from IR 99, IR 143 and a machine-gun section attacked from the front and on both flanks. The attack was repulsed by British machine-gun fire but on the right, the 8th Company of SIR 105 and pioneers managed to bomb their way close to the craters and dug in under artillery-fire. Around on 18 April, three German counter-attacks began which were repelled with many losses; bombing parties of 2nd Company, 15, got into a crater on the German left flank but were then annihilated. German high explosive and gas shells and machine-gun fire in enfilade from Zandvoorde and the Caterpillar, forced the British back to the crest, except on the right flank, where they were forced further back. German attacks continued all day on 18 April but at a counter-attack by two British battalions retook the hill.

===19–22 April===

Before dawn on 19 April, most of the 13th Brigade was relieved by the 15th Brigade. The Germans maintained a heavy bombardment of the hill and on 20 April, after hours of &quot;annihilation bombardment&quot; attacked again mainly with bombing parties, before infantry assaults were attempted at and defeated by British machine-gun fire. German attacks continued into 21 April, by when the hill had become a moonscape of overlapping shell-holes and mine craters. The German infantry dug a jumping-off line () and a stop line further back protected by the German artillery. The divisions of II Corps and V Corps simulated attack preparations on 21 April but on 22 April, the French 45e Division was struck by the first German gas attack of the Second Battle of Ypres and British artillery batteries were transferred northwards.

==German counter-attack==

===1–7 May===
Hill 60 was retaken by the Germans following a series of gas attacks from 1 to 5 May. On 1 May, a German attack preceded by a chlorine gas discharge failed for the first time; after a bombardment by heavy artillery, the Germans released the gas at from positions fewer than away from Hill 60, on a front of . The gas arrived so quickly that most of the British troops were unable to put on their improvised respirators. As soon the gas reached the British positions, the Germans attacked from the flanks with bombing parties, as artillery laid a barrage on the British approaches to the hill. Some of the British garrison were able to return fire, which gave enough time for reinforcements to arrive, after rushing through the gas cloud. The German infantry were forestalled and bombing parties forced them back. The original garrison suffered severely for holding on despite the gas and lost many casualties.

The 15th Brigade held the hill and about of the line on either side, when the Germans discharged gas from two places opposite the hill at on 5 May. The wind blew the gas along rather than across the British defences and only one sentry was able to sound the gas alarm. The British defence plan required troops under gas attack to move to the flanks but the course of the gas cloud made this impossible. The gas hung so thick that even after re-damping cotton respirators, it was impossible to remain in the trenches and those troops who stood their ground were overcome. German infantry of the 30th Division advanced fifteen minutes after the gas cloud and occupied nearly all of the front line on the lower slope of the hill. British reinforcements arrived and bombed their way up a communication trench and two more battalions were sent up; before they arrived, the Germans released more gas at to the north-east of the hill.
The right flank of the British defence at the Zwarteleen salient was overwhelmed, which increased the gap left by the first discharge; enough men on the left survived to pin the German infantry down until when a battalion arrived after advancing through the gas cloud and an artillery barrage. Constant counter-attacks forced some of the Germans back and regained several lost trenches. The Germans held on to the crest and released more gas at which had little effect and an infantry attack which followed was repulsed by rifle-fire. At the 13th Brigade arrived with orders from Major-General Morland, the 5th Division commander, to retake the hill. The brigade attacked at after a twenty-minute bombardment but found that the darkness, broken state of the ground and alert German infantry made it impossible to advance, except for one party which reached the top of the hill, only to be forced to withdraw at by enfilade-fire from the Caterpillar and Zwarteleen. The hill was untenable unless the Caterpillar a considerable amount of ground on the flanks was also occupied; both sides were exhausted and spent the next day digging-in. At dawn on 7 May, the British attacked the hill with two companies of infantry and attached bombers using hand grenades, all of whom were killed or captured.

===Air operations===

1 Squadron began standing patrols on 17 April at with Avro 504s and B.E.8s, to cover the front between Kemmel Hill and Ypres until No German aircraft were able to interfere and surprise was ensured; British artillery began a counter-battery bombardment when the attack began and one pilot was able to identify camouflaged German guns by flash spotting. By the morning of 18 April, British troops had been pushed back to the near slope but a wireless and signal light station had been established at the headquarters of the 5th Division, to which air observers could report direct. British fighters drove away German aircraft which tried to operate over the battlefield and during the evening the crest was recaptured. 1 Squadron had eight aircraft over the hill at to flash spot and discovered On 19 April, British artillery bombarded the areas where the guns had been seen, while aircraft patrolled the area and noted that the German guns were far less active.

Next day, 1 Squadron searched for a German battery firing on trenches on the hill and located the battery which ceased fire and on 21 April, more German guns were suppressed by artillery-fire directed from the air. German attacks diminished until 1 May, when an aircraft flying towards Hill 60 caused the German artillery to cease fire as soon as it arrived, until when failing light forced the crew to return, at which the German artillery resumed the bombardment until a German infantry attack, which was repulsed. On 5 May, the Germans attacked again and captured the crest, then held it against British counter-attacks. On 6 May, 1 Squadron conducted a photographic reconnaissance before another attack and quickly delivered them to the commander of the attacking battalion; the attack failed and operations were ended.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The German army had been waiting for favourable weather to use gas in an attack at Ypres and used the fighting at Hill 60, to lay blame on the British for being the first to use gas, after the British mistakenly accused the Germans. Doubts among some of the British commanders, as to the tactical wisdom of converting a raid into an attack intended to retain the hill, were borne out by the cost of holding the hill and its loss, as soon as the Germans had the opportunity to launch a methodical counter-attack (). Both sides alleged that their opponent had used gas; the Germans had dug in gas cylinders along the XV Corps front, including Hill 60 and feared that some of the cylinders had fallen into British hands. The British noticed the presence of gas but attributed it to gas shells, which were not fired onto the hill by the Germans until 20 April. The German Official History , recorded that the British used new sapper detachments to prepare the attack on Hill 60 and that on 18 April, Saxon troops had recaptured the hill, except for the craters, where the attack failed because new chemical shells () had been ineffective. The hill was re-captured by the Germans on 5 May and skirmishing continued until 7 May.

===Casualties===
In the attack on 7 April, the British lost only seven casualties. On 1 May, the 1st Dorsets lost over to gas poisoning; brought to dressing stations where died immediately and another twelve men died later; the battalion had only The 1st Bedfords suffered similarly, having recently taken on many fresh and inexperienced replacements. Of casualties admitted to hospital died. The 13th Brigade casualties from 17 to 19 April were and the 15th Brigade suffered from 1 to 7 May, out of the 5th Division total of 

===Subsequent operations===

Deep mining under the German galleries beneath Hill 60 began in late August 1915 with the 175th Tunnelling Company which began a gallery behind the British front line and passed beneath. The 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company took over in April 1916 and completed the galleries, the Hill 60 mine being charged with of explosives in July 1916 and a branch gallery under the Caterpillar filled with a charge in October. The 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took over in November 1916, led in part by Captain Oliver Woodward and maintained the mines over the winter. At on 7 June 1917, a mines filled with of explosives, were detonated under the German lines. The blasts created one of the largest explosions in history, reportedly heard in London and Dublin, demolishing a large part of the hill and killing German soldiers.

The Battle of Messines (7–14 June 1917) was conducted by the Second Army (General Herbert Plumer), on the Western Front near the village of Messines. The offensive forced the German army to move reserves to Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts, which relieved pressure on the French. The tactical objective of the attack at Messines was to capture the German defences on the ridge, which ran from Ploegsteert Wood (Plugstreet to the British) in the south through Messines and Wytschaete to Mt Sorrel, to deprive the 4th Army of the high ground south of Ypres. The ridge commanded the British defences and back areas further north, from which the British intended to conduct the Northern Operation to advance to Passchendaele Ridge, then capture the Belgian coast up to the Dutch frontier.

The 47th (1/2nd London) Division and 23rd Division formed the left defensive flank of the attack, advancing onto the ridge around the Ypres–Comines canal and railway, past the mines at Caterpillar and Hill 60. The cuttings of the canal and railway were a warren of German dugouts but the 47th (1/2nd London) Division crossed the of the German front position in close up to the creeping barrage, German infantry surrendering along the way. Soft ground in the valley south of Mt. Sorrel, led the two infantry brigades of the 23rd Division to advance on either side, up to the near crest of the ridge, arriving while the ground still shook from the mines at . North of the canal, the 47th (1/2nd London) Division had to capture a spoil heap long, where several German machine-gun nests had been dug in. The British attacks established a footing on the heap at great cost, due to machine-gun fire from the spoil heap and others in Battle Wood further north. The 23rd Division had many casualties caused by flanking machine-gun fire from the spoil heap while clearing Battle Wood, which took until the evening.

<text>Jens Ingebret Evensen (5 November 1917 – 15 February 2004) was a Norwegian lawyer, judge, politician (for the Labour Party), trade minister, international offshore rights expert, member of the International Law Commission and judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

He negotiated Norway&#x27;s trading deal with European Economic Community in 1972 as minister of commerce in which he served in the governments of both Trygve Bratteli and Odvar Nordli. He then served as maritime law minister until 1979. He worked to secure government income from Norwegian oil discoveries. The UN&#x27;s oceans treaty (1982) is fundamentally based on Evensen&#x27;s work.

== Early life ==
Evensen grew up in a labour environment in Oslo (called Kristiania until 1925). He was the son Jens Evensen (1877–1957) and Hanna Marie Victoria Bjerkås (1885–1958). His father was a successful butcher in Grønland. His father routinely gave out meat and sausages to the underprivileged on the east side of Oslo and Evensen himself helped out to support those who had no work or food. Evensen was originally to take over his father&#x27;s butcher business

In 1936 Evensen enrolled in the University of Oslo Law School. His first job after he graduated was at the law firm Folkvard Bugge. The firm specialized in helping tenants to enforce their legal right to buy the apartments they lived in. Evensen helped the tenants, many of whom were illiterate, and explained the rights they had.

During the German occupation of Norway, Evensen volunteered in the Norwegian resistance movement, helping, among other things, to create false identity papers. After World War II, he was appointed attorney in fact and prosecutor a number of treasons trials the Norwegian government brought against collaborators during the post-war legal purge. Here he began the extensive work of finding what collaborationist leader Vidkun Quisling and his subordinates had stolen during the war. Nonetheless, Evensen distanced himself from the death penalty eventually handed to Quisling.

In 1947, he went to the United States to further his education. He was granted a scholarship by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and began his study at Harvard University. This was an international environment where he got to know and befriend many people from the oil business. 

==Career==
Evensen led the Norwegian Foreign Ministry&#x27;s legal department from 1961 to 1973. Norway was unprepared when representatives from Phillips Petroleum in the US came to Norway in 1962 to request oil exploration rights in the North Sea. Evensen took up the challenge, and proceeded to develop the foundation for the country&#x27;s legal claims to the Norwegian continental shelf. Former prime ministers Odvar Nordli and Kaare Willoch praised Evensen&#x27;s work on securing Norway&#x27;s rights to offshore resources, which, in turn, spawned the country&#x27;s oil industry.

He later became a politician, campaigning against joining the European Economic Community. He also served as trade minister for the Labour Party. He was both respected and controversial and angered fellow Labour Party officials when he agreed to shared management of fishing resources in the Barents Sea with the Soviet Union.

His top aide, Arne Treholt, was later convicted of spying for the Soviet Union, and Evensen reportedly never got over the shock and disappointment.

Evensen also came into conflict with foreign minister Knut Frydenlund in 1980, when he supported a nuclear-free zone in the Nordic Countries.

==Later life==
He remained an international expert on offshore rights and contributed to the creation of economic zones extending out to sea. He later became a judge at the international court in The Hague, sitting until 1993.

He died in February 2004.

<doc id="474202" wikidata="Q1042470" url="?curid=474202" title="Carlo Rovelli">
<text>Carlo Rovelli (born 3 May 1956) is an Italian theoretical physicist and writer who has worked in Italy, the United States, France, and Canada. He is currently Emeritus Professor at the Centre de Physique Theorique of Marseille in France, a Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at the Perimeter Institute, core member of the Rotman Institute of Philosophy of Western University in Canada, and Fractal Faculty of the Santa Fe Institute in The United States. 

Rovelli works mainly in the field of quantum gravity and is a founder of the theory of loop quantum gravity. He has also worked in the history and philosophy of science, formulating the Relational quantum mechanics and the notion of Thermal Time. He collaborates with several Italian newspapers, including the cultural supplements of the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, &quot;Il Sole 24 Ore&quot;, and &quot;La Repubblica&quot;. His popular science book, &quot;Seven Brief Lessons on Physics&quot;, was originally published in Italian in 2014. It has sold over two millions copies worldwide. In 2019, he was included by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine in the list of the 100 most influential global thinkers. In 2021, he was included by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine in the list of the 50 world&#x27;s top thinkers.

==Life and career==
Carlo Rovelli was born in Verona, Italy, on 3 May 1956. He attended the Liceo Classico Scipione Maffei in Verona. In the 1970s, he participated in the student political movements in Italian universities. He was involved with the free political radio stations Radio Alice in Bologna and Radio Anguana in Verona, which he helped found. In conjunction with his political activity, he was charged, but later released, for crimes of opinion related to the book &quot;Fatti Nostri,&quot; which he co-authored with Enrico Palandri, Maurizio Torrealta, and Claudio Piersanti.

Rovelli has credited his use of LSD at this time with sparking his interest in theoretical physics, saying of his experience: &quot;it was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually... Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead; the flow of time was not passing any more... And I thought: ‘Well, it&#x27;s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?&quot;

In 1981, Rovelli graduated with a BS/MS in physics from the University of Bologna, and in 1986 he obtained his PhD at the University of Padova, Italy. Rovelli refused military service, which was compulsory in Italy at the time, and was therefore briefly detained in 1977. He held postdoctoral positions at the University of Rome, the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, and Yale University. Rovelli was on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh from 1990 to 2000, where he was also affiliated with the Department of History and Philosophy of Science. Since 2000 he has been a professor at the Centre de Physique Théorique de Luminy of Aix-Marseille University in France.

==Main contributions==
===Loop quantum gravity===
In 1988, Rovelli, Lee Smolin and Abhay Ashtekar introduced a theory of quantum gravity called loop quantum gravity. In 1995, Rovelli and Smolin obtained a basis of states of quantum gravity, labelled by Penrose&#x27;s spin networks, and using this basis they were able to show that the theory predicts that area and volume are quantized. This result indicates the existence of a discrete structure of space on a very small scale. In 1997, Rovelli and Michael Reisenberger introduced a &quot;sum over surfaces&quot; formulation of the theory, which has since evolved into the currently covariant &quot;spin foam&quot; version of loop quantum gravity. In 2008, in collaboration with Jonathan Engle and Roberto Pereira, he has introduced the spin foam vertex amplitude which is the basis of the current definition of the loop quantum gravity covariant dynamics. Loop theory is today considered a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. It finds applications in quantum cosmology, spinfoam cosmology and quantum black hole physics.

===Physics without time===
In his 2004 book, &quot;Quantum Gravity&quot;, Rovelli developed a formulation of classical and quantum mechanics that does not make explicit reference to the notion of time. The first step towards a theory of quantum gravity without a time variable is described by Wheeler–DeWitt equation. The timeless formalism is used to describe the world in the regimes where the quantum properties of the gravitational field cannot be disregarded. This is because the quantum fluctuation of spacetime itself makes the notion of time unsuitable for writing physical laws in the conventional form of evolution laws in time.

This position led him to face the following problem: if time is not part of the fundamental theory of the world, then how does time emerge? In 1993, in collaboration with Alain Connes, Rovelli proposed a solution to this problem called the thermal time hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, time emerges only in a thermodynamic or statistical context. If this is correct, the flow of time is not fundamental, deriving from the incompleteness of knowledge. Similar conclusions had been reached earlier in the context of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, in particular in the work of Robert Zwanzig, and in Caldeira-Leggett models used in quantum dissipation.

===Relational quantum mechanics===
In 1994, Rovelli introduced the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics, based on the idea that the quantum state of a system must always be interpreted relative to another physical system (like the &quot;velocity of an object&quot; is always relative to another object, in classical mechanics). The idea has been developed and analyzed in particular by Bas van Fraassen and by Michel Bitbol. Among other important consequences, it provides a solution of the EPR paradox that does not violate locality.
Rovelli has expressed the main idea of relational quantum mechanics in the popular book &quot;Helgoland&quot;.

===Relative information===
Rovelli won the second prize in the 2013 FQXi contest &quot;It From Bit or Bit From It?&quot; for his essay about &quot;relative information&quot;. His paper, &quot;Relative Information at the Foundation of Physics&quot;, discusses how &quot;Shannon&#x27;s notion of relative information between two physical systems can function as [a] foundation for statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, without referring to subjectivism or idealism...[This approach can] represent a key missing element in the foundation of the naturalistic picture of the world.&quot; In 2017, Rovelli elaborated further upon the subject of relative information, writing that: In nature, variables are not independent; for instance, in any magnet, the two ends have opposite polarities. Knowing one amounts to knowing the other. So we can say that each end “has information” about the other. There is nothing mental in this; it is just a way of saying that there is a necessary relation between the polarities of the two ends. We say that there is &quot;relative information&quot; between two systems anytime the state of one is constrained by the state of the other. In this precise sense, physical systems may be said to have information about one another, with no need for a mind to play any role. Such &quot;relative information&quot; is ubiquitous in nature: The colour of the light carries information about the object the light has bounced from; a virus has information about the cell it may attach, and neurons have information about one another. Since the world is a knit tangle of interacting events, it teems with relative information. When this information is exploited for survival, extensively elaborated by our brain, and may be coded in a language understood by a community, it becomes mental, and it acquires the semantic weight that we commonly attribute to the notion of information. But the basic ingredient is down there in the physical world: physical correlation between distinct variables. The physical world is not a set of self-absorbed entities that do their selfish things. It is a tightly knitted net of relative information, where everybody&#x27;s state reflects somebody else&#x27;s state. We understand physical, chemical, biological, social, political, astrophysical, and cosmological systems in terms of these nets of relations, not in terms of individual behaviour. Physical relative information is a powerful basic concept for describing the world. Before “energy,” “matter,” or even “entity.”

===History and philosophy of science===
Rovelli has written a book on the Greek philosopher Anaximander, published in France, Italy, US and Brazil. The book analyses the main aspects of scientific thinking and articulates Rovelli&#x27;s views on science. Anaximander is presented in the book as a main initiator of scientific thinking.

For Rovelli, science is a continuous process of exploring novel possible views of the world; this happens via a &quot;learned rebellion&quot;, which always builds and relies on previous knowledge but at the same time continuously questions aspects of this received knowledge. The foundation of science, therefore, is not certainty but the very opposite, a radical uncertainty about our own knowledge, or equivalently, an acute awareness of the extent of our ignorance.

===Religious views===
Rovelli defines himself as &quot;serenely atheist&quot;. He discussed his religious views in several articles and in his book on Anaximander. He argues that the conflict between rational/scientific thinking and structured religion may find periods of truce (&quot;there is no contradiction between solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations and believing that God created Heaven and Earth&quot;), but it is ultimately unsolvable, because most religions demand the acceptance of some unquestionable truths, while scientific thinking is based on the continuous questioning of any truth. Thus, for Rovelli, the source of the conflict is not the pretense of science to give answers for Rovelli, the universe is full of mystery and a source of awe and emotions but, on the contrary, the source of the conflict is the acceptance of our ignorance at the foundation of science, which clashes with religions&#x27; pretense to be depositories of certain knowledge.

==Political engagement, pacifism, and controversies==
Rovelli&#x27;s first book was on the Italian student political movements in the 1970s. He later refused Italy&#x27;s compulsory military draft and was briefly detained. In 2021, he coordinated the Global Peace Dividend, an open letter signed by more that 50 Nobel Laureates, including the Dalai Lama, calling for all countries to negotiate a balanced cut on their military spending by 2% a year for the next five years, and put half the saved money in a UN fund to combat pandemics, the climate crisis, and extreme poverty.

On 1 May 2023, Rovelli gave a political speech at the large Italian Labour Day concert in Rome, inviting the youth to engage politically for the environment, economical equality and peace, and criticizing the Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto for his direct involvement with the industrial military complex. The speech raised a large controversy. As a consequence, his invitation to represent Italy at the 2024 Frankfurt Book Fair was cancelled; the cancellation itself was widely criticized, leading to his re-invitation, and the resignation of the Italian Commissary for the Buchmesse. Rovelli repeated his call for reduced military spending and improved international cooperation following the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. That same year, he was one of the signatories of the International Peace Conference manifesto, which accuses the West (e.g., the United States, the European Union, and NATO) of attacking &quot;Russia with the clear goal to destroy it as a sovereign state&quot;. The manifesto goes on to trace this Western aggression as the driving force behind the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="474204" wikidata="Q786615" url="?curid=474204" title="The Currents of Space">
<text>The Currents of Space is a science fiction novel by the American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1952. It is the second (by internal series chronology) of three books labeled the &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; series, but it was the last of the three to be written. Each occurs after humans have settled many worlds in the galaxy, after the second wave of colonization that went beyond the Spacer worlds, and before the era of decline that was the setting for the original &quot;Foundation&quot; series.

Asimov stated in 1988 in the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; to &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; that book #6 in the Foundation universe chronology was &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; (1952) and that it was &quot;the first of my Empire novels.&quot; Book #7 was &quot;The Stars, Like Dust&quot; (1951), which was &quot;the second Empire novel.&quot;

==Plot summary==
The story takes place during the process of Trantor&#x27;s rise from a large regional power to a galaxy-wide empire, unifying millions of worlds. The approximate date is around the year 11,000 AD (originally 34,500 AD, according to Asimov&#x27;s early 1950s chronology), when the Trantorian Empire encompasses roughly half of the galaxy.

The independent planet Sark rules, and exploits, the planet Florina which orbits the star located nearest to Sark&#x27;s sun. Sark derives great wealth from kyrt, a natural plant fiber which is extraordinarily useful and versatile, but which cannot be grown on Sark or on any planet other than Florina. The relationship between the two planets is analogous to that between European imperial powers and their colonies during the 19th century, or the owners and slaves on the cotton plantations of US South: native Florinians are forced to work in kyrt fields and are treated as an inferior race by the resident Sarkites. They are also lighter-skinned than most humans on other worlds, but this is no longer viewed as significant. Memories of racism on Earth have been lost.

Attempts to break the Sark monopoly and grow kyrt on worlds other than Florina have so far been unsuccessful, because kyrt plants grown on other planets do not produce kyrt, only a useless, inferior form of cellulose; no one understands why. So Sark&#x27;s wealth depends on its colonial dominance of Florina. The government of Trantor naturally wishes to add the two worlds to its growing empire.

The action centers around Rik, a man suffering from gross amnesia and apparent feeble-mindedness. When Rik gradually starts remembering his past, a political crisis involving Sark, Florina, and Trantor ensues. Rik must dodge planetary law-enforcement agents and interstellar spies as he attempts to learn his own history and identity, which the government of Sark is trying to prevent. Ultimately he learns that before losing his memory he was a &quot;spacio-analyst&quot;: a specialized astronaut who gathers samples of the very sparse interstellar gasses in outer space, and determines their composition. (The spacio-analysts&#x27; slogan is &quot;We analyze Nothing&quot;.) He also finds out that he had discovered that Florina&#x27;s sun is about to explode into a nova because it is being exposed to a stream of isolated gaseous carbon atoms flowing through its region of space. The carbon atoms, besides causing Florina&#x27;s sun to approach nova-stage, are also the reason kyrt grows on Florina: they are causing Florina&#x27;s sun to emit a special energetic wavelength of light which kyrt plants need in order to bio-synthesize the kyrt fiber. Streams of carbon atoms (&quot;carbon currents&quot;) are very rare in space; the reason the plants do not make kyrt when grown on planets orbiting other stars is that Florina is the only known habitable planet whose sun is located in the path of a carbon current.

Because losing Florina would mean losing the principal source of Sark&#x27;s vast wealth, there was an attempt to use the knowledge to blackmail Sark&#x27;s rulers. His amnesia was caused by the blackmailer&#x27;s misuse of a mind-altering device called a &quot;psychic probe&quot; in an attempt to calm him down before he could seek other means to make it public. However, once Rik recovers his memory and reveals the effect of the carbon atoms, the conditions that enable kyrt to grow are understood and can be easily duplicated anywhere.

Rik also learns that he was born on the planet Earth, which is now radioactive. He suggests that Earth was the planet where humanity first originated, but this hypothesis remains controversial.

== Interpretations ==
The book has often been seen as Asimov&#x27;s comment on race and the USA&#x27;s past. But with differences of skin-colour reversed:

&quot;The Currents of Space is best seen as Asimov’s take on race relations in the United States as of the early 1950s, before the rise of the Civil Rights movement...

&quot;Asimov doesn’t really bother to hide his reliance on history here, any more than he did in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. He even calls our attention to it by making the inhabitants of Florina fair-skinned and red-haired—paler by far than the inhabitants of most other planets, including Sark. To drive home the point, an official of the Interstellar Bureau of Spatio-analysis (IBS) who is trying to locate the missing Spatio-analyst is noted as being from the planet in the galaxy with the darkest average skin color and wooly hair.&quot;

&quot;Asimov has the cotton plantations of North America in mind when describing conditions in Florina but has cunningly reversed the complexions of master and servant. On Florina, lighter-skinned people do the work, and darker folk enjoy the wealth which is produced.&quot;

== Science ==
When Asimov wrote the book, the cause of novae was unknown. His idea was that it was caused by a star switching from the Proton–proton chain to the CNO cycle. This is not in fact the cause, and stars like our sun are too small to fuse hydrogen that way. There are real &#x27;currents of space&#x27;, but they have nothing to do with the matter.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Groff Conklin described the novel as &quot;one of Asimov&#x27;s lesser efforts, but still considerably above the average space opera&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Floyd C. Gale told readers &quot;Don&#x27;t miss&quot; it and the other Empire novels. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas found &quot;The Currents of Space&quot; an advance from Asimov&#x27;s previous work and described it as &quot;first-rate entertainment [that] is so much more adroitly plotted than Asimov&#x27;s previous ventures in this vein that it stands up as an intricate and constantly surprising spy-suspense story.&quot;

<text>Gilles Vigneault (; born 27 October 1928) is a Canadian poet, publisher, singer-songwriter, and Quebec nationalist and sovereigntist. Two of his songs are considered by many to be Quebec&#x27;s unofficial anthems: &quot;Mon pays&quot; and &quot;Gens du pays&quot;, and his line &quot;Mon pays ce n&#x27;est pas un pays, c&#x27;est l&#x27;hiver&quot; (&quot;My country is not a country, it is winter&quot;, from &quot;Mon Pays&quot;) became a proverb in Quebec. Vigneault is a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec, Knight of the Legion of Honour, and Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

==Life and career==
Vigneault was born in Natashquan, in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec.

He started writing poetry during his studies at the seminary in Rimouski, and by the 1950s was publishing poems and writing songs for other performers. In 1959, he founded the publishing house &quot;Les Éditions de l&#x27;Arc&quot; to distribute his publications. His first collection, &quot;Étraves&quot;, was published in 1959.

In 1960, Vigneault made his singing debut at the L&#x27;Arlequin club in Quebec City, followed by a successful Montreal concert later that year. In 1962, he recorded his first album, &quot;Gilles Vigneault&quot;, and received the Grand Prix du Disque from Montreal radio station CKAC. His reputation grew in Quebec and beyond with the success of his song &quot;Mon Pays&quot;, from the soundtrack of the NFB film &quot;The Snow Has Melted on the Manicouagan (La neige a fondu sur la Manicouagan)&quot; in 1965.

Vigneault&#x27;s reputation as a songwriter and performer continued to spread and he became popular not only in Quebec, but also in English Canada and Europe. He performed in major Canadian concert halls, including Montreal&#x27;s Place des Arts, the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, and at Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall. In Europe, he toured in France, Switzerland, Poland, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

The mid-1970s saw Vigneault&#x27;s participation in several major events. On 13 August 1974, 130,000 spectators came together on the Plains of Abraham for the &quot;Superfrancofête&quot;, where Vigneault participated in a historic concert alongside Félix Leclerc and Robert Charlebois. The concert was recorded and released as the album &quot;&quot;. At the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day concert &quot;Les 5 Jean-Baptistes&quot; on Montreal&#x27;s Mount Royal on 24 June 1976, Gilles Vigneault performed together with Robert Charlebois, Claude Léveillée, Jean-Pierre Ferland, and Yvon Deschamps. This concert was recorded and released as &quot;1 fois 5&quot;, which later received the Grand Prix du Disque (the Charles Cros award). In October 2022, he received an honorary doctorate from Université TÉLUQ for his lifetime achievements, notably his contribution to Québécois identity, which mirrored, according to spokesperson Lucie Laflamme, TELUQ&#x27;s own mission to &quot;solely offer distance education in French across North America, a core of the foundation behind what made us unique for the last 50 years&quot;.

Vigneault&#x27;s political views have remained strongly in favour of national sovereignty for Quebec. During the 2014 Quebec general election campaign, he supported the Parti Québécois.

The main subjects of Vigneault&#x27;s writing are Quebec and its people, as well as human relationships, love, and everyday life. Vigneault is also concerned with environmental issues and has written songs and tales for children.
His childhood reminiscences about his upbringing were filmed by Michel Moreau for the 1993 documentary film &quot;A Childhood in Natashquan&quot; (Une enfance à Natashquan).
==Family==
Gilles Vigneault has seven children: Michel, Louis, François (a poet and lyricist), Pascale, Guillaume (a novelist), Jessica (a pianist and singer), and Benjamin (a percussionist).

<text>The Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), originally also called the &quot;Color/Graphics Adapter&quot; or &quot;IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter&quot;, introduced in 1981, was IBM&#x27;s first color graphics card for the IBM PC and established a de facto computer display standard.

==Hardware design==
The original IBM CGA graphics card was built around the Motorola 6845 display controller, came with 16 kilobytes of video memory built in, and featured several graphics and text modes. The highest display resolution of any mode was 640 × 200, and the highest color depth supported was 4-bit (16 colors).

The CGA card could be connected either to a direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 color display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a television set without a composite video input required a separate RF modulator.

IBM produced the &quot;5153 Personal Computer Color Display&quot; for use with the CGA, but this was not available at release and would not be released until March 1983.

Although IBM&#x27;s own color display was not available, customers could either use the composite output (with an RF modulator if needed), or the direct-drive output with available third-party monitors that supported the RGBI format and scan rate. Some third-party displays lacked the intensity input, reducing the number of available colors to eight, and many also lacked IBM&#x27;s unique circuitry which rendered the dark-yellow color as brown, so any software which used brown would be displayed incorrectly.

==Output capabilities==
CGA offered several video modes.

Graphics modes:

* 160 × 100 in 16 colors, chosen from a 16-color palette, utilizing a specific configuration of the 80 × 25 text
** This used 4 bits per pixel, with a total memory use of (160 * 100 * 4) / 8 = 8 kilobytes.
* 320 × 200 in 4 colors, chosen from 3 fixed palettes, with high- and low-intensity variants, with color 1 chosen from a 16-color palette.
** This used 2 bits per pixel, with a total memory use of (320 * 200 * 2) / 8 = 16 kilobytes.
* 640 × 200 in 2 colors, one black, one chosen from a 16-color palette.
** This used 1 bit per pixel, with a total memory use of (640 * 200) / 8 = 16 kilobytes.
Some software achieved greater color depth by utilizing artifact color when connected to a composite monitor.

Text modes:

* 40 × 25 with 8 × 8 pixel font (effective resolution of 320 × 200)
* 80 × 25 with 8 × 8 pixel font (effective resolution of 640 × 200)

IBM intended that CGA be compatible with a home television set. The 40 × 25 text and 320 × 200 graphics modes are usable with a television, and the 80 × 25 text and 640 × 200 graphics modes are intended for a monitor.

==Color palette==
CGA uses a 4-bit RGBI 16-color gamut, but not all colors are available at all times, depending on which graphics mode is being used. In the medium- and high-resolution modes, colors are stored at a lower bit depth and selected by fixed palette indexes, not direct selection from the full 16-color palette.

When four bits are used (for low-resolution mode, or for programming color registers) they are arranged according to the RGBI color model:

* The lower three bits represent red, green, and blue color components
* The fourth &quot;intensifier&quot; bit, when set, increases the brightness of all three color components (red, green, and blue).

These four colour bits are then interpreted internally by the monitor, or converted to NTSC colours (see below).

===With an RGBI monitor===
When using a direct-drive monitor, the four color bits are output directly to the DE-9 connector at the back of the card.

Within the monitor, the four signals are interpreted to drive the red, green and blue color guns. With respect to the RGBI color model described above, the monitor would translate the digital four-bit color number to some seven distinctive analog voltages in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 for each gun.

Color 6 is treated specially; normally, color 6 would become &quot;dark yellow&quot;, as seen to the left, but in order to achieve a more pleasing brown tone, special circuitry in most RGBI monitors, starting with the IBM 5153 color display, makes an exception for color 6 and changes its hue from dark yellow to brown by reducing the analogue green signal&#x27;s amplitude. The exact amount of reduction differed between monitor models: the original IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display reduces the green signal&#x27;s amplitude by about one third, while the IBM 5154 Enhanced Color Display internally converts all 4-bit RGBI color numbers to 6-bit ECD color numbers, which amounts to halving the green signal&#x27;s amplitude. The Tandy CM-2, CM-4 and CM-11 monitors provide a potentiometer labelled &quot;BROWN ADJ.&quot; to adjust the amount of green signal reduction.

This &quot;RGBI with tweaked brown&quot; palette was retained as the default palette of later PC graphics standards such as EGA and VGA, which can select colors from much larger gamuts, but default to these until reprogrammed.

Later video cards/monitors in CGA emulation modes would approximate the colors with the following formula:
 &quot;red&quot; := 2/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 4)/4 + 1/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 8)/8
 &quot;green&quot; := 2/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 2)/2 + 1/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 8)/8
 &quot;blue&quot; := 2/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 1)/1 + 1/3×(&quot;colorNumber&quot; &amp; 8)/8
 if (color == 6)
 green := green * 2/3

which yields the canonical CGA palette:

===With a composite color monitor/television set===
For the composite output, these four-bit color numbers are encoded by the CGA&#x27;s onboard hardware into an NTSC-compatible signal fed to the card&#x27;s RCA output jack. For cost reasons, this is not done using an RGB-to-YIQ converter as called for by the NTSC standard, but by a series of flip-flops and delay lines.

Consequently, the hues seen are lacking in purity; notably, both cyan and yellow have a greenish tint, and color 6 again looks dark yellow instead of brown.

The relative luminances of the colors produced by the composite color-generating circuit differ between CGA revisions: they are identical for colors 1-6 and 9-14 with early CGAs produced until 1983, and are different for later CGAs due to the addition of additional resistors.

==Standard text modes==

CGA offers four BIOS text modes (Modes 0 to 3, called alphanumeric or A/N modes in IBM&#x27;s documentation). In these modes, individual pixels on the screen cannot be addressed directly. Instead, the screen is divided into a grid of character cells, each displaying a character defined in one of two bitmap fonts, &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;thin,&quot; included in the card&#x27;s ROM. The fonts are fixed and cannot be modified or selected from software, only by a jumper on the board itself.

Fonts are stored as bitmaps at a color depth of 1-bit, with a &quot;1&quot; representing the character and a &quot;0&quot; representing the background. These colors can be chosen independently, for each character on the screen, from the full 16-color CGA palette. The character set is defined by hardware code page 437.

The font bitmap data is only available to the card itself, it cannot be read by the CPU. In graphics modes, text output by the BIOS operates by copying text from the font ROM bit-by-bit to video memory.

===40 × 25 mode===
BIOS Modes 0 and 1 are both 40 columns by 25 rows text modes, with each character a pattern of 8×8 dots. The effective screen resolution in this mode is 320 × 200 pixels (a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2.) The card has sufficient video RAM for eight different text pages in this mode.

The difference between these two modes can only be seen on a composite monitor, where mode 0 disables the color burst, making all text appear in grayscale. Mode 1 enables the color burst, allowing for color. Mode 0 and Mode 1 are functionally identical on RGB monitors and on later adapters that emulate CGA without supporting composite color output.

=== 80 × 25 mode ===
BIOS Modes 2 and 3 select 80 columns by 25 rows text modes, with each character still an 8×8 dot pattern, but displayed at a higher scan rate. The effective screen resolution of this mode is 640 × 200 pixels. In this mode, the card has enough video RAM for four different text pages.

As with the 40-column text modes, Mode 2 disables the color burst in the composite signal and Mode 3 enables it.

===Textmode color===
Each character cell stored four bits for foreground and background color. However, in the card&#x27;s default configuration, the fourth bit of the background color does not set intensity, but sets the blink attribute for the cell. All characters on the screen with this bit set will periodically blink, meaning their foreground color will be changed to their background color so the character becomes invisible. All characters blink in unison.

By setting a hardware register, the blink feature can be disabled, restoring access to high-intensity background colors.

All blinking characters on the screen blink in sync. The blinking attribute effect is enabled by default and the high-intensity background effect is disabled; disabling blinking is the only way to freely choose the latter eight-color indexes (8-15) for the background color.

Notably, the GW-BASIC and Microsoft QBASIC programming languages included with MS-DOS supported all the text modes of the CGA with full color control, but did not provide a normal means through the BASIC language to switch the CGA from blink mode to 16-background-color mode. This was still possible however by directly programming the hardware registers using the OUT statement of the BASIC language.

==Standard graphics modes==
CGA offers graphics modes at three resolutions: 160 × 100, 320 × 200 and 640 × 200. In all modes every pixel on the screen can be set directly, but the color depth for the higher modes does not permit selecting freely from the full 16-color palette.

=== 320 × 200 ===
In the medium-resolution 320 × 200 modes (Modes 4 and 5), each pixel is two bits, which select colors from a four-color palette. In mode 4, there are two palettes, and in mode 5 there is a single palette.

Several choices can be made by programming hardware registers. First, the selected palette. Second, the intensity – which is defined for the entire screen, not on a per-pixel basis. Third, color 0 (the &quot;background&quot; color) can be set to any of the 16 colors.

The specific BIOS graphics mode influences which palettes are available. BIOS Mode 4 offers two palettes: green/red/brown and cyan/magenta/white.

As with the text modes 0 and 2, Mode 5 disables the color burst to allow colors to appear in grayscale on composite monitor. However, unlike the text modes, this also affects the colors displayed on an RGBI monitor, altering them to the cyan/red/white palette seen above. This palette is not documented by IBM, but was used in some software.

===640 × 200===
In the high-resolution 640 × 200 mode (Mode 6), each pixel is one bit, providing two colors which can be chosen from the 16-color palette by programming hardware registers.

In this mode, the video picture is stored as a simple bitmap, with one bit per pixel setting the color to &quot;foreground&quot; or &quot;background&quot;. By default the colors are black and bright white, but the foreground color can be changed to any entry in the 16-color CGA palette. The background color cannot be changed from black on an original IBM CGA card. 

This mode disables the composite color burst signal by default. The BIOS does not provide an option to turn the color burst on in 640 × 200 mode, and the user must write directly to the mode control register to enable it.

==Further graphics modes and tweaks==

A number of official and unofficial features exist that can be exploited to achieve special effects.

* In 320 × 200 graphics mode, the background color (which also affects the border color), which defaults to black on mode initialization, can be changed to any of the other 15 colors of the CGA palette. This allows for some variation, as well as flashing effects, as the background color can be changed without having to redraw the screen (i.e. without changing the contents of the video RAM).
* In text mode, the border color (displayed outside the regular display area and including the overscan area) can be changed from the default black to any of the other 15 colors.
* Through precision timing, it is possible to switch to another palette while the video is being output, allowing the use of any one of the six palettes per scanline. An example of this is &quot;California Games&quot;, when run on a stock 4.77 MHz 8088. Running on a faster computer does not produce the effect, as the method the programmers used to switch palettes at predetermined locations is extremely sensitive to machine speed. The same can be done with the background color, as is used to create the river and road in &quot;Frogger&quot;. Another documented example of the technique is in Atarisoft&#x27;s port of &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot; to the PC.
* Additional colors can be approximated using dithering.
* Using palette 0 at low intensity and dark blue as the background color provides the three primary RGB colors, as well as brown.

Some of these above tweaks can be combined. Examples can be found in several games.

===160 × 100 16 color mode===

Technically, this mode is not a graphics mode, but a tweak of the 80 × 25 text mode. The character cell height register is changed to display only two lines per character cell instead of the normal eight lines. This quadruples the number of text rows displayed from 25 to 100. These &quot;tightly squeezed&quot; text characters are not full characters. The system only displays their top two lines of pixels (eight each) before moving on to the next row.

Character 221 of the CGA character set consists of a box occupying the entire left half of the character matrix. (Character 222 consists of a box occupying the entire right half.)

Because each character can be assigned different foreground and background colors, it can be colored (for example) blue on the left (foreground color) and bright red on the right (background color). This can be reversed by swapping the foreground and background colors.

Using either character 221 or 222, each half of each truncated character cell can thus be treated as an individual pixel—making 160 horizontal pixels available per line. Thus, 160 × 100 pixels at 16 colors, with an aspect ratio of 1:1.2, are possible.

Although a roundabout way of achieving a 16-color graphics display, this works quite well and the mode is even mentioned (although not explained) in IBM&#x27;s official hardware documentation. This mode was used as early as 1983 on the game &quot;Moon Bugs&quot;.

More detail can be achieved in this mode by using other characters, combining ASCII art with the aforesaid technique. This was explored by &quot;Macrocom, Inc&quot; on two games: &quot;Icon: Quest for the Ring&quot; (released in 1984) and &quot;The Seven Spirits of Ra&quot; (released in 1987).

The same text cell height reduction technique can also be used with the 40 × 25 text mode, yielding a resolution of 80 × 100.

==Composite output==

Using the composite output instead of an RGBI monitor produced lower-quality video, due to NTSC&#x27;s inferior separation between luminance and chrominance. This is especially a problem with 80-column text:

For this reason, each of the text and graphics modes has a duplicate mode which disables the composite colorburst, resulting in a black-and-white picture, but also eliminating color bleeding to produce a sharper picture. On RGBI monitors, the two versions of each mode are usually identical, with the exception of the 320 × 200 graphics mode, where the &quot;monochrome&quot; version produces a third palette.

===Extended artifact colors===
Programmers discovered that this flaw could be turned into an asset, as distinct patterns of high-resolution dots would turn into consistent areas of solid colors, thus allowing the display of completely new artifact colors. Both the standard 320 × 200 four-color and the 640 × 200 color-on-black graphics modes could be used with this technique.

====Internal operation====
&quot;Direct colors&quot; are the normal 16 colors as described above under &quot;The CGA color palette&quot;.

&quot;Artifact colors&quot; are seen because the composite monitor&#x27;s NTSC chroma decoder misinterprets some of the luminance information as color. By carefully placing pixels in appropriate patterns, a programmer can produce specific cross-color artifacts yielding a desired new color; either from purely black-and-white pixels in 640 × 200 mode, or resulting from a &quot;combination&quot; of &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;artifact&quot; colors in 320 × 200 mode, as seen on the following pictures:
Thus, with the choice between 320 × 200 vs. 640 × 200 mode, the choice between the two palettes, and one freely-selectable color (the background in 320 × 200 modes and the foreground in 640 × 200 mode), it is possible to use many different sets of artifact colors, making for a total gamut of over 100 colors.
Later demonstrations by enthusiasts have increased the maximum number of colors the CGA can display at the same time to 1024. This technique involves a text mode tweak which quadruples the number of text rows. Certain ASCII characters such as U and ‼ are then used to produce the necessary patterns, which result in non-dithered images with an effective resolution of 80 × 100 on a composite monitor.

160 cycles of the NTSC color clock occur during each line&#x27;s output, so in 40 column mode each pixel occupies half a cycle and in 80 column mode each pixel uses a quarter of a cycle. Limiting the character display to the upper one or two scanlines, and taking advantage of the pixel arrangement in certain characters of the codepage 437, it is possible to display up to 1024 colors. This technique was used in the demo &quot;8088 MPH&quot;.

====Availability and caveats====
The 320 × 200 variant of this technique (see above) is how the standard BIOS-supported graphics mode looks on a composite color monitor. The 640 × 200 variant, however, requires modifying a bit (color burst disable) directly in the CGA&#x27;s hardware registers. As a result, it is usually referred to as a separate &quot;mode.&quot;

Being completely dependent on the NTSC encoding/decoding process, composite color artifacting is not available on an RGBI monitor, nor is it emulated by EGA, VGA or contemporary graphics adapters.

The modern, games-centric PC emulator DOSBox supports a CGA mode, which can emulate a composite monitor&#x27;s color artifacting. Both 640 × 200 composite mode and the more complex 320 × 200 variant are supported.

====Resolution and usage====
Composite artifacting, whether used intentionally or as an unwanted artifact, reduces the effective horizontal resolution to a maximum of 160 pixels, more for black-on-white or white-on-black text, without changing the vertical resolution. The resulting composite video display with &quot;artifacted&quot; colors is sometimes described as a 160 × 200 / 16-color &quot;mode&quot;, though technically it was a technique using a standard mode.

The low resolution of this composite color artifacting method led to it being used almost exclusively in games. Many high-profile titles offered graphics optimized for composite color monitors. &quot;Ultima II&quot;, the first game in the game series to be ported to IBM PC, used CGA composite graphics. &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot; also offered 16-color graphics on the PC, PCjr and Tandy 1000, but provided a &#x27;RGB mode&#x27; at the title screen which would utilize only the ordinary CGA graphics mode, limited to 4 colors.

==Limitations, bugs and errata==
Video timing on the CGA is provided by the Motorola 6845 video controller. This integrated circuit was originally designed only for character-based alphanumeric (text) displays and can address a maximum of 128 character rows.

To realize graphics modes with 200 scanlines on the CGA, the MC6845 is programmed with 100 character rows per picture and two scanlines per character row. Because the video memory address output by the MC6845 is identical for each scanline within a character row, the CGA must use the MC6845&#x27;s &quot;row address&quot; output (i.e. the scanline within the character row) as an additional address bit to fetch raster data from video memory.

This implies that unless the size of a single scanline&#x27;s raster data is a power of two, raster data cannot be laid out continuously in video memory. Instead, graphics modes on the CGA store the even-numbered scanlines contiguously in memory, followed by a second block of odd-numbered scanlines starting at video memory position 8,192. This arrangement results in additional overhead in graphics modes for software that manipulates video memory.

Even though the MC6845 video controller can provide the timing for interlaced video, the CGA&#x27;s circuitry aligns the synchronization signals in such a way that scanning is always progressive. Consequently, it is impossible to double the vertical resolution to 400 scanlines using a standard 15 kHz monitor.

The higher bandwidth used by 80-column text mode results in random short horizontal lines appearing onscreen (known as &quot;snow&quot;) if a program writes directly to video memory during screen drawing. The BIOS avoids the problem by only accessing the memory during horizontal retrace, or by temporarily turning off the output during scrolling. While this causes the display to flicker, IBM decided that doing so was better than snow. The &quot;snow&quot; problem does not occur on any other video adapter, or on most CGA clones.

In the 80-column text mode, the pixel clock frequency is doubled, and all synchronization signals are output for twice the number of clock cycles in order to last for their proper duration. The composite output&#x27;s color burst signal circuit is an exception: because it still outputs the same number of cycles, now at the doubled clock rate, the color burst signal produced is too short for most monitors, yielding no or unstable color. Hence, IBM documentation lists the 80-column text mode as a &quot;feature&quot; only for RGBI and black-and-white composite monitors. Stable color can still be achieved by setting the border color to brown, which happens to produce a phase identical to the correct color burst signal and serves as a substitute for it.

==Dual-head support==
The CGA was released alongside the IBM MDA, and in fact could be installed alongside the MDA in the same computer. A command included with PC DOS permitted switching the display output between the CGA and MDA cards. Some programs like the early MS-DOS versions of AutoCAD supported using both displays concurrently.

==Software support==
CGA was widely supported in PC software up until the 1990s. Some of the software that supported the board was:

* Visi On (an early GUI, used the 640x200 monochrome mode)
* Windows 3.0 (and earlier versions, supported the 640x200 monochrome mode)
* OS/2 1.1 (and earlier versions)
* Graphics Environment Manager (GEM)

==Competing adapters==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in January 1982 described the output from CGA as &quot;very good—slightly better than color graphics on existing microcomputers&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; disagreed, reporting in June 1983 that &quot;the IBM monochrome display is absolutely beautiful for text and wonderfully easy on the eyes, but is limited to simple character graphics. Text quality on displays connected to the color/graphics adapter ... is at best of medium quality and is conducive to eyestrain over the long haul&quot;.

In a retrospective commentary, &quot;Next Generation&quot; also took a negative view on the CGA, stating, &quot;Even for the time (early 1980s), these graphics were terrible, paling in comparison to other color machines available on the market.&quot;

CGA had several competitors:

* For business and word processing use, IBM provided the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) at the same time as CGA. MDA was much more popular than CGA at first. Since a great many PCs were sold to businesses, the sharp, high-resolution monochrome text was more desirable for running applications.
* In 1982, the non-IBM Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) was introduced, the first third-party video card for the PC. In addition to an MDA-compatible text mode, it offered a monochrome graphics mode with a resolution of 720×348 pixels, higher than the CGA.
* Also in 1982 the Plantronics Colorplus board was introduced, with twice the memory of a standard CGA board (32k, compared to 16k). The additional memory can be used in graphics modes to double the color depth, giving two additional graphics modes—16 colors at 320 × 200 resolution, or 4 colors at 640 × 200 resolution.
* The IBM PCjr (1984) and compatible Tandy 1000 (1985) featured onboard &quot;extended CGA&quot; video hardware that extended video RAM beyond 16 kB, allowing 16 colors at 320 × 200 resolution and four colors at 640 × 200 resolution. Because the Tandy 1000 long outlived the PCjr, the video modes became known as &quot;Tandy Graphics Adapter&quot; or &quot;TGA&quot;, and were very popular for games during the 1980s. Similar but less widely used was the Plantronics Colorplus.
* In 1984, IBM also introduced the Professional Graphics Controller, a high-end graphics solution intended for e.g. CAD applications. It was mostly backwards compatible with CGA. The PGC did not see widespread adoption due to its $4,000 price tag, and was discontinued in 1987.

Other alternatives:

* Paradise Systems introduced in 1984 the first successful CGA-compatible card for MDA monitors. It displayed CGA&#x27;s 16 colors in shades of monochrome. Because it was hardware-compatible with CGA, the Paradise card did not need special software support or additional drivers.
* Another extension in some CGA-compatible chipsets (including those in the Olivetti M24 / AT&amp;T 6300, the DEC VAXmate, and some Compaq and Toshiba portables) is a doubled vertical resolution. This gives a higher quality 8 × 16 text display and an additional 640 × 400 graphics mode.

The CGA card was succeeded in the consumer space by IBM&#x27;s Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) card, which supports most of CGA&#x27;s modes and adds an additional resolution (640 × 350) as well as a software-selectable palette of 16 colors out of 64 in both text and graphics modes.

<text>In mathematics, integral equations are equations in which an unknown function appears under an integral sign. In mathematical notation, integral equations may thus be expressed as being of the form: formula_1
where formula_2 is an integral operator acting on &quot;u.&quot; Hence, integral equations may be viewed as the analog to differential equations where instead of the equation involving derivatives, the equation contains integrals. A direct comparison can be seen with the mathematical form of the general integral equation above with the general form of a differential equation which may be expressed as follows:formula_3where formula_4 may be viewed as a differential operator of order &quot;i&quot;. Due to this close connection between differential and integral equations, one can often convert between the two. For example, one method of solving a boundary value problem is by converting the differential equation with its boundary conditions into an integral equation and solving the integral equation. In addition, because one can convert between the two, differential equations in physics such as Maxwell&#x27;s equations often have an analog integral and differential form. See also, for example, Green&#x27;s function and Fredholm theory.

==Classification and overview==
Various classification methods for integral equations exist. A few standard classifications include distinctions between linear and nonlinear; homogeneous and inhomogeneous; Fredholm and Volterra; first order, second order, and third order; and singular and regular integral equations. These distinctions usually rest on some fundamental property such as the consideration of the linearity of the equation or the homogeneity of the equation. These comments are made concrete through the following definitions and examples:

=== Linearity ===
: An integral equation is linear if the unknown function &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and its integrals appear linearly in the equation. Hence, an example of a linear equation would be:formula_5As a note on naming convention: i) &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is called the unknown function, ii) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is called a known function, iii) &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is a function of two variables and often called the Kernel function, and iv) &quot;λ&quot; is an unknown factor or parameter, which plays the same role as the eigenvalue in linear algebra.

: An integral equation is nonlinear if the unknown function &quot;&quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) or any of its integrals appear nonlinear in the equation. Hence, examples of nonlinear equations would be the equation above if we replaced &quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) with formula_6, such as:formula_7Certain kinds of nonlinear integral equations have specific names. A selection of such equations are:

* Nonlinear Volterra integral equations of the second kind which have the general form: formula_8 where &quot;&quot; is a known function.
* Nonlinear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind which have the general form: formula_9.
* A special type of nonlinear Fredholm integral equations of the second kind is given by the form: formula_10, which has the two special subclasses:
** Urysohn equation: formula_11.
** Hammerstein equation: formula_12.

More information on the Hammerstein equation and different versions of the Hammerstein equation can be found in the Hammerstein section below.

=== Location of the unknown equation ===
: An integral equation is called an integral equation of the first kind if the unknown function appears only under the integral sign. An example would be: formula_13.

: An integral equation is called an integral equation of the second kind if the unknown function also appears outside the integral.

: An integral equation is called an integral equation of the third kind if it is a linear Integral equation of the following form:formula_14where &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) vanishes at least once in the interval [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] or where &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) vanishes at a finite number of points in (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;).

=== Limits of Integration ===
Fredholm: An integral equation is called a Fredholm integral equation if both of the limits of integration in all integrals are fixed and constant. An example would be that the integral is taken over a fixed subset of formula_15. Hence, the following two examples are Fredholm equations:
* Fredholm equation of the first type: formula_13.
* Fredholm equation of the second type: formula_17
Note that we can express integral equations such as those above also using integral operator notation. For example, we can define the Fredholm integral operator as:formula_18Hence, the above Fredholm equation of the second kind may be written compactly as:formula_19

: An integral equation is called a Volterra integral equation if at least one of the limits of integration is a variable. Hence, the integral is taken over a domain varying with the variable of integration. Examples of Volterra equations would be: 
* Volterra integral equation of the first kind: formula_20
* Volterra integral equation of the second kind: formula_21
As with Fredholm equations, we can again adopt operator notation. Thus, we can define the linear Volterra integral operator formula_22, as follows:formula_23where formula_24 and &quot;K&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) is called the kernel and must be continuous on the interval formula_25. Hence, the Volterra integral equation of the first kind may be written as:formula_26with formula_27. In addition, a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind for an unknown function formula_28 and a given continuous function formula_29 on the interval formula_30 where formula_31:formula_32: In higher dimensions, integral equations such as Fredholm–Volterra integral equations (VFIE) exist. A VFIE has the form:formula_33with formula_34 and formula_35 being a closed bounded region in formula_36 with piecewise smooth boundary. The Fredholm-Volterra Integral Operator formula_37 is defined as:

formula_38Note that while throughout this article, the bounds of the integral are usually written as intervals, this need not be the case. In general, integral equations don&#x27;t always need to be defined over an interval formula_39, but could also be defined over a curve or surface.

=== Homogeneity ===
: An integral equation is called homogeneous if the known function formula_40 is identically zero.

: An integral equation is called inhomogeneous if the known function formula_40 is nonzero.

=== Regularity ===
: An integral equation is called regular if the integrals used are all proper integrals.

 or : An integral equation is called singular or weakly singular if the integral is an improper integral. This could be either because at least one of the limits of integration is infinite or the kernel becomes unbounded, meaning infinite, on at least one point in the interval or domain over which is being integrated.

Examples include:formula_42formula_43These two integral equations are the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform of &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), respectively, with both being Fredholm equations of the first kind with kernel formula_44 and formula_45, respectively. Another example of a singular integral equation in which the kernel becomes unbounded is: formula_46This equation is a special form of the more general weakly singular Volterra integral equation of the first kind, called Abel&#x27;s integral equation: formula_47: An integral equation is called strongly singular if the integral is defined by a special regularisation, for example, by the Cauchy principal value.

=== Integro-differential equations ===
An Integro-differential equation, as the name suggests, combines differential and integral operators into one equation. There are many version including the Volterra integro-differential equation and delay type equations as defined below. For example, using the Volterra operator as defined above, the Volterra integro-differential equation may be written as:formula_48For delay problems, we can define the delay integral operator formula_49 as:formula_50where the delay integro-differential equation may be expressed as:
formula_51

== Volterra integral equations ==

=== Uniqueness and existence theorems in 1D ===
The solution to a linear Volterra integral equation of the first kind, given by the equation:formula_26can be described by the following uniqueness and existence theorem. Recall that the Volterra integral operator formula_22, can be defined as follows:formula_23where formula_24 and &quot;K&quot;(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;s&quot;) is called the kernel and must be continuous on the interval formula_25. 

The solution to a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind, given by the equation:formula_57can be described by the following uniqueness and existence theorem. 
=== Volterra integral equations in formula_58===

A Volterra Integral equation of the second kind can be expressed as follows:formula_59where formula_60, formula_61, formula_62 and formula_63. This integral equation has a unique solution formula_64 given by:formula_65where formula_66 is the resolvent kernel of &quot;K&quot;.

=== Uniqueness and existence theorems of Fredholm–Volterra equations ===
As defined above, a VFIE has the form:formula_33with formula_34 and formula_35 being a closed bounded region in formula_36 with piecewise smooth boundary. The Fredholm–Volterrra Integral Operator formula_37 is defined as:formula_38In the case where the Kernel &quot;K&quot; may be written as formula_73, &quot;K&quot; is called the positive memory kernel. With this in mind, we can now introduce the following theorem:
=== Special Volterra equations ===
A special type of Volterra equation which is used in various applications is defined as follows:formula_74where formula_24, the function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is continuous on the interval formula_76, and the Volterra integral operator formula_77 is given by:formula_78with formula_79.

== Converting IVP to integral equations ==
In the following section, we give an example of how to convert an initial value problem (IVP) into an integral equation. There are multiple motivations for doing so, among them being that integral equations can often be more readily solvable and are more suitable for proving existence and uniqueness theorems.

The following example was provided by Wazwaz on pages 1 and 2 in his book. We examine the IVP given by the equation:

formula_80and the initial condition:

formula_81

If we integrate both sides of the equation, we get:

formula_82

and by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we obtain:

formula_83

Rearranging the equation above, we get the integral equation:

formula_84

which is a Volterra integral equation of the form:

formula_85

where &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is called the kernel and equal to 2&quot;t&quot;, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1.

== Numerical solution ==
It is worth noting that integral equations often do not have an analytical solution, and must be solved numerically. An example of this is evaluating the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) or magnetic-field integral equation (MFIE) over an arbitrarily shaped object in an electromagnetic scattering problem.

One method to solve numerically requires discretizing variables and replacing integral by a quadrature rule

:formula_86

Then we have a system with equations and variables. By solving it we get the value of the variables

:formula_87

==Integral equations as a generalization of eigenvalue equations==
Certain homogeneous linear integral equations can be viewed as the continuum limit of eigenvalue equations. Using index notation, an eigenvalue equation can be written as
:formula_88
where is a matrix, is one of its eigenvectors, and is the associated eigenvalue.

Taking the continuum limit, i.e., replacing the discrete indices and with continuous variables and , yields
:formula_89
where the sum over has been replaced by an integral over and the matrix and the vector have been replaced by the &quot;kernel&quot; and the eigenfunction . (The limits on the integral are fixed, analogously to the limits on the sum over .) This gives a linear homogeneous Fredholm equation of the second type.

In general, can be a distribution, rather than a function in the strict sense. If the distribution has support only at the point , then the integral equation reduces to a differential eigenfunction equation.

In general, Volterra and Fredholm integral equations can arise from a single differential equation, depending on which sort of conditions are applied at the boundary of the domain of its solution.

==Wiener–Hopf integral equations==

formula_90
Originally, such equations were studied in connection with problems in radiative transfer, and more recently, they have been related to the solution of boundary integral equations for planar problems in which the boundary is only piecewise smooth.

== Hammerstein equations ==
A Hammerstein equation is a nonlinear first-kind Volterra integral equation of the form:formula_91Under certain regularity conditions, the equation is equivalent to the implicit Volterra integral equation of the second-kind:formula_92where:formula_93The equation may however also be expressed in operator form which motivates the definition of the following operator called the nonlinear Volterra-Hammerstein operator:formula_94Here formula_95 is a smooth function while the kernel &quot;K&quot; may be continuous, i.e. bounded, or weakly singular. The corresponding second-kind Volterra integral equation called the Volterra-Hammerstein Integral Equation of the second kind, or simply Hammerstein equation for short, can be expressed as:formula_96In certain applications, the nonlinearity of the function &quot;G&quot; may be treated as being only semi-linear in the form of:formula_97In this case, we the following semi-linear Volterra integral equation:formula_98In this form, we can state an existence and uniqueness theorem for the semi-linear Hammerstein integral equation. 

We can also write the Hammerstein equation using a different operator called the Niemytzki operator, or substitution operator, formula_99 defined as follows:formula_100More about this can be found on page 75 of this book.

== Applications ==
Integral equations are important in many applications. Problems in which integral equations are encountered include radiative transfer, and the oscillation of a string, membrane, or axle. Oscillation problems may also be solved as differential equations.

<doc id="474241" wikidata="Q1990686" url="?curid=474241" title="Multi-Color Graphics Array">
<text>The Multi-Color Graphics Array or MCGA is a video subsystem built into the motherboard of the IBM PS/2 Model 30, introduced in April 1987, and Model 25, introduced later in August 1987; no standalone MCGA cards were ever made.

The MCGA supports all CGA display modes plus monochrome at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, and with 256 colors (out of an 18-bit RGB palette of 262,144) at 70 Hz. The display adapter uses a DE-15 connector, sometimes referred to as HD-15.

MCGA is similar to VGA in that it had a 256-color mode (the 256-color mode in VGA was sometimes referred to as MCGA) and uses 15-pin analog connectors. The PS/2 chipset&#x27;s limited abilities prevent EGA compatibility and high-resolution multi-color VGA display modes.

The tenure of MCGA was brief; the PS/2 Model 25 and Model 30 were discontinued by 1992, and the only manufacturer to produce a clone of this display adapter was Epson, in the Equity Ie and PSE-30, since the VGA standard introduced at the same time was considered superior.

==Software support==
The 256-color mode proved most popular for gaming. 256-color VGA games ran fine on MCGA as long as they stuck to the basic 256-color mode and didn&#x27;t attempt to use VGA-specific features such as multiple screen pages.

Games lacking support for 256-color graphics were forced to fall back to four-color CGA mode (or not run at all) due to the incompatibility with EGA video modes (, , or , all in 16 colors). Some games, including point-and-click adventures from Sierra On-line and Lucasfilm Games, as well as simulation and strategy titles from Microprose, solved this problem for low-resolution titles by supporting the MCGA&#x27;s 256-color mode and picking the colors most resembling the EGA 16-color RGB palette, while leaving the other available colors in that mode unused. 

Higher resolution titles were often unsupported unless graphics could be converted into either MCGA low or high ( monochrome, which would also support and with some letterboxing) resolution mode in an acceptable fashion. An alternative approach used by a small number of (generally earlier) games was to use four-color CGA assets but make use of the adaptor&#x27;s ability to freely change the palette for a slightly enhanced appearance.

==Output capabilities==
MCGA offered:
* monochrome (mode 11h)
* in 256 colors (from a palette of 262,144; mode 13h)

CGA compatible modes:
* text mode with 8×8 pixel font (effective resolution of ; mode 0/1h)
* text mode with 8×8 pixel font (effective resolution of ; mode 2/3h)
* in four colors from a 16 color hardware palette with a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2. (mode 4/5h)
* in two colors with a pixel aspect ratio of 1:2.4 (mode 6h)

<doc id="474245" wikidata="Q901448" url="?curid=474245" title="Einstein (unit)">
<text>The einstein (symbol E) is an obsolete unit with two conflicting definitions. It was originally defined as the energy in one mole of photons (). Because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength, the unit is frequency dependent. This unit is not part of the International System of Units (SI) and is redundant with the joule. If it were still in use, as of the 2019 revision of the SI, its value would be related to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation by
: 1 einstein = 1 mol × = 1 mol × × × = × ,
where is the Avogadro constant, is the Planck constant, and is the frequency.

Sometime later, the unit was used differently in studies of photosynthesis to mean one mole of photons, rather than the energy in one mole of photons. As such, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was formerly often reported in microeinsteins per second per square meter (μE⋅m−2⋅s−1). This usage is also not part of the SI and when used this way it is redundant with the mole.

Since the unit does not have a standard definition and is not part of the SI system, it has long been considered obsolete. The same information about photosynthetically active radiation can be conveyed using the SI convention by stating something such as &quot;a photon flux of 1500 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1&quot;.

This unit was named after physicist Albert Einstein.

<doc id="474246" wikidata="Q27908822" url="?curid=474246" title="Duffy's Tavern">
<text>Duffy&#x27;s Tavern is an American radio sitcom that ran for a decade on several networks (CBS, 1941–42; NBC-Blue Network, 1942–44; and NBC, 1944–51), concluding with the December 28, 1951, broadcast.

The program often featured celebrity guest stars but always hooked them around the misadventures of Archie, the tavern&#x27;s manager, portrayed by Ed Gardner. Archie was prone to involvement in get-rich-quick schemes and romantic missteps, and constantly communicated with malaprops and mixed metaphors. Gardner had performed the character of Archie, talking about Duffy&#x27;s Tavern, as early as November 9, 1939, when he appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Good News of 1940&quot;.

==Characters and story==
In the early 1940s, Gardner worked as a director, writer, and producer for radio programs. In 1941, he created a character for &quot;This Is New York&quot;, a program that he was producing. The character, which Gardner played, became Archie of &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

In the familiar opening, &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,&quot; performed either solo on an old-sounding piano or by a larger orchestra, is interrupted by the ring of a telephone and Gardner&#x27;s New Yorkese accent as he answers, &quot;Hello, Duffy&#x27;s Tavern, where the elite meet to eat. Archie the manager speakin&#x27;. Duffy ain&#x27;t here—oh, hello, Duffy.&quot;

Owner Duffy was never heard nor seen, either on the radio program or in the 1945 film adaptation or the short-lived 1954 TV series. Archie constantly bantered with Duffy&#x27;s man-crazy daughter, Miss Duffy, played by several actresses, beginning with Gardner&#x27;s real-life first wife, Shirley Booth, followed by Florence Halop and, later, by actress Hazel Shermet, and especially with Clifton Finnegan (Charlie Cantor, later Sid Raymond), a likeable soul with several screws loose and a knack for falling for every other salesman&#x27;s scam. Eddie the Waiter was played by Eddie Green. The pianist Fats Pichon took over the role after Green&#x27;s death in 1950. 

Hoping to take advantage of the income-tax-free status of Puerto Rico, Gardner moved &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; there in 1949. Unfortunately, many guest personalities declined to make the journey to appear on the show and it eventually went off the air in 1951.

==Guest stars==
The series featured many high-profile guest stars, including Fred Allen, Mel Allen, Lucille Ball, Joan Bennett, Nigel Bruce, Billie Burke, Bing Crosby, Gracie Fields, Rex Harrison, Susan Hayward, Bob Hope, Lena Horne, Boris Karloff, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Peter Lorre, Tony Martin, Marie McDonald, Vincent Price, Gene Tierney, Arthur Treacher, and Shelley Winters. As the series progressed, Archie slipped in and out of a variety of quixotic, self-imploding plotlines—from writing an opera to faking a fortune to marry an heiress. Such situations mattered less than did the clever depiction of earthbound-but-dreaming New York life and its individualistic, often bizarre characters.

&quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; was Gardner&#x27;s creation, and he oversaw its writing intently enough, drawing also on his earlier experience as a successful radio director. His directing credits included stints for George Burns and Gracie Allen, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot;, and &quot;The Rudy Vallee Hour.&quot; Gardner also brought aboard several keen writing talents, including theatrical humorist Abe Burrows (the show&#x27;s co-creator and head writer for its first five years), future &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; writer Larry Gelbart, and Dick Martin, who later was the co-host of television&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

==Title changes==

Early in the show&#x27;s life, however, its name, &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, was changed—first to &quot;Duffy&#x27;s&quot; and then, for four episodes, to &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Variety&quot;. An employee for Bristol-Myers—whose Ipana toothpaste was the show&#x27;s early sponsor—persuaded the company&#x27;s publicity director to demand the name change because the original title promoted &quot;the hobby of drinking&quot; too much for certain sensibilities. Bristol-Myers eventually admitted the employee had little to go on other than a handful of protesting letters, and—to the delight of fans who never stopped using the original name anyway—the original title was restored permanently. The name change was often subverted by the Armed Forces Radio Network. When the AFRN rebroadcast those episodes for U.S. servicemen during World War II, the announcer referred to &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

==Film and television==

Burrows and Matt Brooks collaborated on the screenplay for the 1945 film, &quot;Ed Gardner&#x27;s Duffy&#x27;s Tavern,&quot; in which Archie (with regulars Eddie and Finnegan) was surrounded by a throng of Paramount Pictures stars playing themselves, including Robert Benchley, William Bendix, Eddie Bracken, Bing Crosby, Cass Daley, Brian Donlevy, Paulette Goddard, Betty Hutton, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake and Dorothy Lamour. The film&#x27;s plot involves a war-displaced record manufacturer whose staff—those not sent off to war—drown their sorrows at Duffy&#x27;s on credit, while the company owner tries to find ways around the price controls and war attrition that threaten to put him out of business. The film was a box office disappointment.

The 1954 syndicated TV series, co-produced by Hal Roach Jr., lacked leading name guest stars.

==British remake==
Broadcast on the BBC Light Programme from 4 July to 29 August 1956, &quot;Finkel&#x27;s Café&quot; was written by Denis Norden and Frank Muir, and produced by Pat Dixon. It starred Peter Sellers and Sid James. Avril Angers and Kenneth Connor were regulars and guest stars included Gilbert Harding.

==Influence==
As a result of the radio program&#x27;s popularity, dozens of bars and inns across the country adopted the name, such as Duffy&#x27;s Tavern in Holmes Beach, Florida.

&quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; has inspired references in popular culture formats:

* &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, the low-keyed spinoff from the groundbreaking &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which moved the now-title character from the loading dock and the taxicab to running a blue-collar bar with his usual repertoire of malaprops. 
* The soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (whose title family oriented around tavern-owning Irish parents). 
* The 1980s situation comedy &quot;Cheers&quot; (co-created by James Burrows, the son of &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot; co-creator Abe Burrows). 
* Jackie Gleason&#x27;s &quot;Joe the Bartender&quot; sketches. These usually began with Joe (Gleason) in a conversation with an unseen patron, Mr. Dennehy, before being joined (usually at Dennehy&#x27;s request) by a Finnegan-like, cheerful dolt, Crazy Guggenheim (Frank Fontaine). 
* One of the regular cartoon sequences from &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot; (produced by Hanna-Barbera between 1959 and 1962) was called &quot;Snooper and Blabber&quot;, featuring a pair of cat and mouse detectives. Daws Butler patterned the voice of Super Snooper (the cat) (&quot;Leave us not be hasty, Blab!&quot;) after Ed Gardner&#x27;s Archie on &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. 
* &quot;George and Junior&quot; was a short-lived theatrical cartoon series produced by MGM. All of the postwar shorts were directed by Tex Avery, who based them on George and Lennie from John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, as well as Archie and Finnegan from &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. 
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the form of Moe the bartender, who answers the telephone saying, &quot;Moe&#x27;s Tavern, where the elite meet to drink.&quot;
* The show was parodied in the 1947 &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoon &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Skiing Ya.&quot; A billboard advertises: &quot;Stuffy&#x27;s Tavern. Where the Elite Beat the Heat. Lake Plastered, NY.&quot;
*The 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Hush My Mouse&quot; also parodied the show, with Sniffles the mouse visiting &quot;Tuffy&#x27;s Tavern.&quot;
* Puerto Rico&#x27;s best-rated television program of 1956, &quot;La Taberna India&quot;, was loosely based on &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

<doc id="474247" wikidata="Q4355656" url="?curid=474247" title="Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar">
<text>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar is a radio drama that aired on CBS Radio from February 18, 1949 to September 30, 1962.

The first several seasons imagined protagonist Johnny Dollar as a private investigator drama, with Charles Russell, Edmond O&#x27;Brien and John Lund portraying Dollar in succession over the years. In 1955 after a yearlong hiatus, the series came back in its best-known incarnation with Bob Bailey starring in &quot;the transcribed adventures of the man with the action-packed expense accountAmerica&#x27;s fabulous freelance insurance investigator.&quot; There were 809 episodes (plus two not-for-broadcast auditions) in the 13-year run, and more than 710 still exist today. Jim Cox&#x27;s book &quot;American Radio Networks: A History&quot; cites &quot;886 total performances&quot; which includes repeat performances.

==Format==
The format best remembered was instituted by writer-director Jack Johnstone. Each case usually started with a phone call from an insurance adjuster, calling on Johnny to investigate an unusual claim: a suspicious death, an attempted fraud, a missing person, or other mysterious circumstances. Each story required Johnny to travel to some distant locale, usually within the United States but sometimes abroad, where he was almost always threatened with personal danger in the course of his investigations. He would compare notes with the police officials who had first investigated each strange occurrence, and followed every clue until he figured out what actually happened. Johnny&#x27;s file on each case was usually referenced as a &quot;matter,&quot; as in &quot;The Silver Blue Matter&quot; or &quot;The Forbes Matter&quot;. Later episodes were more fanciful, with titles like &quot;The Wayward Trout Matter&quot; and &quot;The Price of Fame Matter&quot; (the latter featuring a rare guest-star appearance by Vincent Price as himself; here Price and Dollar team up to retrieve a painting stolen by Price&#x27;s insurance agent).

Johnny usually stuck to business, but would sometimes engage in romantic dalliances with women he encountered in his travels; later episodes gave Johnny a steady girlfriend, Betty Lewis. Johnny&#x27;s precious recreational time was usually spent fishing, and it was not uncommon for Johnny&#x27;s clients to exploit this favorite pastime in convincing him to take on a job near good fishing locations. His past was rarely mentioned, but Dollar in “The Bennett Matter” described himself as a four-year US Marine veteran who then worked as a police officer for a decade before changing careers to insurance investigation. In &quot;The Blackburn Case&quot; Dollar also refers to his time as a Pinkerton Detective.

Each story was recounted in flashback, and every few minutes the action would be interrupted by Johnny listing a line item from his expense account, which served as an effective scene transition. Most of the expense account related to transportation, lodging, and meals, but no incidental expense was too small for Johnny to itemize, as in &quot;Item nine, 10 cents. Aspirin. I needed them.&quot; The monetary amounts weren&#x27;t always literal: the smallest line item Johnny ever recorded was &quot;two cents: what I felt like&quot; after a professional setback; the largest was &quot;one million dollars&quot; (the way he felt after finding a missing woman and her daughter in a snowbound cabin). The episodes generally finished with Johnny tallying up his expense account and traveling back to Hartford, Connecticut, where he was based. Sometimes Johnny would add a sardonic postscript under &quot;Remarks,&quot; detailing the aftermath of the case. (&quot;The Todd Matter,&quot; which especially disgusted Johnny, ended abruptly with &quot;Remarks – &quot;nil!&quot;&quot;)

In later seasons the program sometimes referred to itself, with other characters recognizing Dollar&#x27;s voice from the radio; in the episode “The Salkoff Sequel Matter” Johnny’s radio show becomes an important plot point.

== History ==
===Original run===
As originally conceived, Johnny Dollar was a smart, tough, wisecracking detective who tossed silver-dollar tips to waiters and bellhops. Dick Powell starred in the audition show, recorded in 1948, but withdrew from the role in favor of other detective programs, &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot; and &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;. The Johnny Dollar role went instead to Charles Russell. The show for which Powell auditioned was originally titled &quot;Yours Truly, Lloyd London&quot;, although the name of the show and its lead character were changed to avoid legal problems with the actual insurance company, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, before the audition tape of December 7, 1948, was recorded.

With the first three actors to play Johnny Dollar – radio actor Russell and movie tough-guy actors Edmond O&#x27;Brien and John Lund – there was little to distinguish &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot; from other detective series at the time (&quot;Richard Diamond&quot;, &quot;Philip Marlowe&quot; and &quot;Sam Spade&quot;). While always a friend of the police, Johnny wasn&#x27;t necessarily a stickler for the strictest interpretation of the law. He was willing to let some things slide to satisfy his own sense of justice, as long as the interests of his employer were also protected. One of the script writers in this period was Blake Edwards. The series ended in September 1954.

===Revival===

CBS Radio revived &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; in October 1955 with a new leading man, a new director, and a new format. The program changed from a 30-minute, one-episode-per-week program to a 15-minute, five-nights-a-week serial (Monday through Friday, 8–8:15 pm EST) produced and directed by radio veteran Jack Johnstone. The new Johnny Dollar was Bob Bailey, who had just come off another network detective series, &quot;Let George Do It&quot;. With a new lead and 75 minutes of air time each week, it became possible to develop each storyline with more detail and with more characters. Almost all of the Johnny Dollar serials were presented by CBS Radio on a sustaining basis (unsponsored, with no commercials); only two of the 55 serials take time out for a sponsor&#x27;s message.

Bob Bailey was exceptionally good in this format, making Johnny more sensitive and thoughtful in addition to his other attributes. Vintage-radio enthusiasts often endorse Bailey as the best of the Johnny Dollars, and consider the 13-month run of five-part stories to be some of the greatest drama in radio history. The serial scripts were usually written by Johnstone, &quot;John Dawson&quot; (a pseudonym for E. Jack Neuman), Les Crutchfield, or Robert Ryf. The show was always produced and directed by Johnstone. Under his &quot;John Dawson&quot; pseudonym, Neuman reworked several of his scripts from the John Lund period, expanding and/or combining them into scripts for the serial format. The show featured a stock company of supporting actors, including Virginia Gregg, Harry Bartell, Vic Perrin, Lawrence Dobkin, Stacy Harris, Parley Baer, Howard McNear, John Dehner, Barney Phillips, Lillian Buyeff, Tony Barrett, Don Diamond, Alan Reed, and Forrest Lewis. Movie character actors appeared occasionally, including Jay Novello, Hans Conried, Frank Nelson, Leon Belasco, William Conrad, Edgar Barrier, Jeanne Bates, Gloria Blondell, and Billy Halop.

In late 1956, CBS Radio retooled the show, which reverted to a weekly half-hour drama, airing on late Sunday afternoons. Bob Bailey continued in the leading role until 1960 and wrote one episode, &quot;The Carmen Kringle Matter,&quot; under his first and middle names (Robert Bainter).

Staff announcer Dan Cubberly introduced the program during the Edmond O&#x27;Brien run; Roy Rowan was the announcer for the first two years of Bob Bailey&#x27;s run; he also was an announcer on CBS&#x27;s &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. In &quot;The Laird Douglas Matter,&quot; Roy Rowan was written into the script as dog-show expert &quot;Ray Roland.&quot; In 1957, Rowan was succeeded by Dan Cubberly, returning to the series.

===Changes at CBS===
CBS Radio tried to institute an economy measure in June 1959: its four remaining dramatic series (&quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;; &quot;Suspense&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; starring William Conrad; and &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; starring John Dehner) would be moved from Hollywood to New York. The plan met with some resistance, because the cast members and crews of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; were willing to cancel the shows themselves rather than move to New York. The situation was stalemated for 17 months, as all four programs remained on the air. Finally, in November 1960, CBS Radio kept &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in California, discontinued &quot;Have Gun - Will Travel&quot;, and moved &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot; to New York. Bob Bailey, unwilling to relocate, gave up the Johnny Dollar role. Bailey&#x27;s last performance, aired November 27, 1960, was in a script titled &quot;The Empty Threat Matter,&quot; perhaps writer Johnstone&#x27;s editorial comment on CBS&#x27;s intention to shut down production in California.

In New York, CBS staff producer Bruno Zirato Jr. (who also directed TV game shows for CBS) took over &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;, although Johnstone continued to write the scripts. Former child actor Bob Readick took over the leading role in a manner reminiscent of the original Dollar, Charles Russell. After six months he was replaced by Mandel Kramer, who gave the role his own low-key interpretation. Many fans found Mandel Kramer second only to Bailey as the most effective Johnny Dollar. Both Readick and Kramer were members of CBS&#x27;s stock company in New York, and both appeared in other CBS dramas.

===The end===
The final episodes of &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot;, airing on CBS, are often cited as the end of the golden age of radio. The last episode of &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot;, &quot;The Tip-Off Matter&quot;, ended at 6:35 p.m. Eastern Time on September 30, 1962, followed immediately by the final broadcast of &quot;Suspense&quot;.

Although network radio drama returned to the airwaves – in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Theater Five&quot; (1964–65), and &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; (1974–82) – these were anthology series and did not have continuing character, albeit the latter did spark a bit of a revival of drama on U.S. commercial radio networks in the 1970s. The &quot;Golden Age&quot; of radio drama, as pioneered in the 1920s, died with &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot; in 1962.

Three unsuccessful attempts were made to transfer the success of &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; to television. Charles Russell starred in a 1949 pilot directed by Ralph Levy, Bob Bailey starred in a 1958 pilot entitled &quot;The Adventures of Johnny Dollar&quot; (which failed because Bailey&#x27;s 5-foot 9-inch, 150-pound physique didn&#x27;t match the tough-guy characterization), and William Bryant starred in a 1962 pilot entitled &quot;Johnny Dollar.&quot; The latter was written, produced, and directed by Blake Edwards.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; was so familiar to CBS Radio&#x27;s listeners that the network&#x27;s resident comedians, Bob and Ray, occasionally satirized it. Their version, &quot;Ace Willoughby, International Detective,&quot; followed the &quot;Johnny Dollar&quot; format of exotic locales, continental officials, cool villains, and tense confrontations, with Ray Goulding doing a letter-perfect imitation of Bob Bailey&#x27;s delivery. In the comedy version, however, the detective usually gave up on the case after being beaten up incessantly.

&quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; was a popular weekly radio mystery play in the 1960s and early 1970s on Radio Iran. The role of Johnny Dollar was played by Heidar Saremi, a popular radio performer. Contrary to the original, Johnny Dollar was more of a criminal investigator. At the end of each episode, the narrator asked the radio audience how Johnny found the perpetrators, making the show a mystery quiz as well as a drama; those who guessed correctly were entered into a raffle for a prize.

In the 1970s and 1980s the comedy troupe The Firesign Theatre released a number of satirical record albums; several featured spoofs of old-time radio featuring the character &quot;Nick Danger, Third Eye,&quot; who was loosely based on Sam Spade and Johnny Dollar. The scripts included inside references to radio with lines such as, &quot;It had been snowing in Santa Barbara ever since the top of the page,&quot; and riffs on radio sound effects.

In 2003, Moonstone Books adapted the &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; radio program into a graphic novel illustrated by Éric Thériault and written by David Gallaher.

The show has been the opening item on &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; on WAMU in Washington, D.C. off and on since the early 1990s.

As of August 2017, the show is being aired several times a day on KTQA FM 95.3 in Tacoma, Washington and CHLU-FM in Middle LaHave, Nova Scotia, Canada.

In August 2021, the SiriusXM satellite radio network began airing many episodes of the show on its &quot;Radio Classics&quot; channel 148.

As of February 2019, a documentary about the program, &quot;Last Man Standing – Johnny Dollar &amp; the End of Old-Time Radio&quot;, has been produced.

In 2023, a new graphic novel series was launched with Johnny Dollar investigating cybercrimes of the modern age. &quot;The man with the action packed expense account&quot; is a cyberinsurance investigator, taking on ransomware actors in the modern age.

<text>Prosimians are a group of primates that includes all living and extinct strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorisoids, and adapiforms), as well as the haplorhine tarsiers and their extinct relatives, the omomyiforms, i.e. all primates excluding the simians. They are considered to have characteristics that are more &quot;primitive&quot; (ancestral or plesiomorphic) than those of simians (monkeys, apes, and humans).

Simians emerged within the Prosimians as sister group of the haplorhine tarsiers, and therefore cladistically belong to this group. Simians are thus distinctly closer related to tarsiers than lemurs are. Strepsirrhines bifurcated some 20 million years earlier than the tarsier - simian bifurcation. However, simians are traditionally excluded, rendering prosimians paraphyletic. Consequently, the term &quot;prosimian&quot; is no longer widely used in a taxonomic sense, but is still used to illustrate the behavioral ecology of tarsiers relative to the other primates.

Prosimians are the only primates native to Madagascar, but are also found throughout Africa and in Asia.

==Characteristics==

Being an evolutionary grade rather than a clade, the prosimians are united by being primates with traits otherwise found in non-primate mammals. Their diets typically are less dominated by fruit than those of the simians, and many are active arboreal predators, hunting for insects and other small animals in the trees. All prosimians outside Madagascar are nocturnal, meaning that no prosimian competes directly with simian primates (the only nocturnal simians are New World monkeys of genus &quot;Aotus&quot;).

Related to their frequently nocturnal lifestyle, prosimians lack the colour vision of higher primates. Like most placental mammals, they are in effect red–green colour blind. This allows for more rod cells in the retina, which may enhance vision under low-light conditions. Except in tarsiers, the nocturnal vision is further augmented by a reflective tapetum lucidum behind the retina, similar to that found in other nocturnal mammals. This layer reflects the light that passes through the retina, increasing the photoreceptors exposure to the light. It is however not well developed in diurnal forms like many lemurs.

All prosimians possess two laterally flattened toilet claws, used for grooming. These are found on the second toe in lemurs and lorises, and the second and third in tarsiers. Aye-ayes have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux, including a toilet claw on the second toe. Clawlike nails are however also found in the small-bodied callitrichids, a group of New World monkeys, though none of them have a toilet claw.

Male strepsirrhine prosimians have relatively large bacula. Male tarsiers do not have bacula. The prosimians have retained the primitive mammalian condition of a bicornuate uterus, with two separate uterus chambers. In the simians, the uterus chambers have fused, an otherwise rare condition among mammals. Prosimians usually have litters rather than single offspring, which is the norm in higher primates.

While primates are often thought of as fairly intelligent animals, the prosimians are not very large-brained compared to other placental mammals. Their brain-cases are markedly smaller than those of simians of comparable sizes. In the large-eyed tarsiers, the weight of the brain is about the same as that of a single eye. Prosimians generally show lower cognitive ability and live in simpler social settings than the simians. The prosimians with the most complex social systems are the diurnal lemurs, which may live in social groups of 20 individuals. The nocturnal prosimians are mainly solitary.

==Classification==

The prosimians were once a group considered a suborder of the primate order (suborder Prosimii - Gr. &quot;pro&quot;, before, + Latin &quot;simius/simia&quot;, ape), which was named in 1811 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger. They have been shown, however, to be paraphyletic - that is, their most recent common ancestor was a prosimian but it has some non-prosimian descendants (i.e. monkeys and apes). This relationship is shown by the ranks (prosimians in bold) in the list below of the current primate classification between the order and infraorder level. The term &quot;prosimian&quot; is considered taxonomically obsolete, although it is used to emphasize similarities between strepsirrhines, tarsiers, and the early primates.

* Order Primates
** Suborder Strepsirrhini: non-tarsier prosimians
*** Infraorder Adapiformes: extinct &quot;lemur-like&quot; primates
*** Infraorder Lemuriformes: lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies
** Suborder Haplorrhini: tarsiers, monkeys and apes
*** Infraorder Omomyiformes: extinct &quot;tarsier-like&quot; primates
*** Infraorder Tarsiiformes: tarsiers
*** Infraorder Simiiformes: New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans

<text>Celartem, Inc., doing business as Extensis, is a software company based in Portland, Oregon.

==History==
Extensis and its parent company &quot;CreativePro.com&quot; were sold to &quot;ImageX&quot; in year 2000, which in turn sold Extensis to Japanese content-management company Celartem Technology in 2002. In 2003, Extensis acquired competitor DiamondSoft and their Font Reserve applications (stand-alone and client-server). In January 2006, Extensis merged its two font management products, Font Reserve and Suitcase into a single product called Suitcase Fusion. In August 2010, Extensis launched WebINK, a web font subscription service. This service was discontinued on July 1, 2015.

In 2018, Extensis united with its sister company, LizardTech, to continue developing and distributing software for compressing and distributing massive, high-resolution geospatial data.

<text>Democratic Underground is an online community for members of the Democratic Party in the United States. Its membership is restricted by policy to those who are supportive of the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates for political office.

== History ==
Created on December 5, 2000, Democratic Underground was launched on January 20, 2001, the day George W. Bush was inaugurated as United States president. It describes itself as a &quot;grassroots left-of-center political community&quot; and &quot;an online community for friendly, politically liberal people who understand the importance of working together to elect more Democrats and fewer Republicans to all levels of American government&quot;.

As of June 2008, over 122,000 user accounts were registered and over 38 million messages had been posted. Democratic Underground publishes articles several days a week and hosts an online store, a directory of links, and forums where members may post on various topics of interest. Discussions from posters at Democratic Underground attracted national attention. One example of this was the dialog about the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, in which a few posts explored the possibility of &quot;earthquake weapons&quot;. The posts were reported by John Schwartz on &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Brit Hume on Fox News. An administrator also sent a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which was printed.

Earlier in 2003, the site attracted the attention of James Taranto in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; when a poster explained why they wished to see continued bloodshed in Iraq. The forum was mentioned by Chuck Raasch of &quot;USA Today&quot; within the context of conspiracy theories about the August 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot to blow up airliners between the United Kingdom and the United States. One poster suggested that one reason for why the liquids were banned on airplanes was to allow the airlines to significantly charge more money for their own beverages and that the American government&#x27;s push to release the announcement of the plot was done to bump Joe Lieberman&#x27;s primary loss out of the news cycle. On Election Day 2016, the forum was hacked and rendered unavailable, which the site blamed on pro-Trump trolls.

== Copyright infringement lawsuit ==

In 2010, Democratic Underground was sued for alleged copyright infringement in a member&#x27;s posting of a few paragraphs from an article in the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;. The suit was brought by Righthaven, an entity that finds &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; quotations online, buys the copyright for that story from the newspaper, and retroactively sues for copyright infringement. In response to the lawsuit, Democratic Underground asserted that the quoted excerpt (five sentences of a 54-sentence article) was fair use, and counterclaimed against Righthaven for fraud, barratry, and champerty. Democratic Underground was represented in the case &quot;pro bono&quot; by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, attorneys from the firm of Winston &amp; Strawn, and Las Vegas attorney Chad Bowers. After Righthaven lost a similar suit against Realty One Group over 8 of 30 sentences quoted from a news article, Righthaven asked the judge in the case against Democratic Underground to dismiss Righthaven&#x27;s claim against Democratic Underground. On June 14, 2011, Judge Roger L. Hunt ruled that Righthaven be dismissed from the case because Righthaven had never owned the copyright of the article and gave Righthaven two weeks to explain in writing why it should not be sanctioned.

<text>Marcus Scott Chong (né Wyatt; born July 8, 1967) is an American actor. He played Miguel Mendez in the crime drama, &quot;Street Justice&quot; (1991–1993), real-life activist Huey P. Newton in &quot;Panther&quot; (1995), directed by Mario Van Peebles, and Tank in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), directed by The Wachowskis.

==Early life==
Chong was born in Seattle on July 8, 1967, to an African-American father and a Chinese mother. His biological father, Martin Wyatt, was a sports reporter in San Francisco for KGO-TV. He was adopted by Tommy and Shelby Chong in 1978.

==Career==
Chong began acting at age nine. His first role was portraying the young Frankie Warner in the 1979 miniseries &quot;&quot; (1979). He was a guest star in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, in &quot;Blind Journey: Part 2&quot;.

Chong originated the role of student Lee Cortez in the Broadway production of &quot;Stand-Up Tragedy&quot;, written by Bill Cain, which opened at the Criterion Center Stage Right and closed in October 1990 after 13 performances. The short-lived role nevertheless earned him a 1991 Theatre World Award; he was also nominated Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play.

In the early 1990s, Chong played the recurring character Miguel Mendez on the TV show &quot;Street Justice&quot; from 1991 to 1993. By 1994, he later appeared in the action series &quot;Vanishing Son&quot; as Fu Qua Johnson alongside many actors of Asian descent. In 1995, he appeared in the music video for &quot;Temptations&quot; with Coolio, Ice-T, and Jada Pinkett Smith.

In 1999, Chong appeared as Tank in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Throughout the 2000s decade and briefly the 2010s, Chong has appeared in popular TV shows in supporting guest roles. In 2001, he appeared in the third season of the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and in 2002, appeared in the first season of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In 2009, he appeared in the sixth season of &quot;Numb3rs&quot; and in 2010, he had a role in the fourth season of &quot;Burn Notice&quot;.

Chong&#x27;s last feature film role was in the 2005 movie &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot; as a character named War. The film was released briefly in theaters in Chong&#x27;s hometown of Seattle, Washington. Following this, he&#x27;s appeared in multiple short films: &quot;Concrete River&quot; (2009), &quot;Son Shine&quot; (2013), and &quot;Not 4 Sale&quot; (2013); the latter in which he plays legendary actor Harry Belafonte. Following the last short film &quot;Not 4 Sale&quot;, Chong has had no acting roles since.

==The Matrix controversy==
In May 2003, Chong filed a lawsuit at Los Angeles County Superior Court against Warner Bros and AOL Time Warner, saying Warner was in breach of a 1998 verbal agreement, and a 2000 contract to continue the character of Tank in the film&#x27;s two sequels. Chong was offered a total of $250,000 to appear in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. Chong claimed he was owed twice that amount, in addition to bonuses and guarantees he would be invited to press junkets and premieres. When the Wachowskis rejected his demands, Chong was arrested in October 2000 for allegedly making threatening phone calls to the filmmakers. In his suit, Chong claimed he had since been blackballed from Hollywood and blamed &quot;The Matrix&quot; creators and Warner Bros. for branding him a &quot;terrorist&quot;.

In 2016, Chong did a radio interview with BlogTalkRadio going into detail regarding behind-the-scenes issues during production of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and instances that occurred afterwards where he felt he was treated unfairly.

In 2018, he released a documentary, &quot;The Marcus Chong Story&quot;, on his YouTube channels (under the names &quot;Marcus Wyatt&quot; and &quot;Marcus Chong&quot;), detailing his life and the issues he&#x27;s faced working with actor C. Thomas Howell on the direct-to-video movie &quot;Pure Danger&quot; (1996) and during production of &quot;The Matrix&quot; in 1998.

<text>In baseball (hardball or softball), a starting pitcher or starter is the first pitcher in the game for each team. A pitcher is credited with a game started if they throw the first pitch to the opponent&#x27;s first batter of a game. Starting pitchers are expected to pitch for a significant portion of the game, although their ability to do this depends on many factors, including effectiveness, stamina, health, and strategy.

A starting pitcher in professional baseball usually rests three, four, or five days after pitching a game before pitching in another. Therefore, most professional baseball teams have four, five or six starting pitchers on their rosters. These pitchers, and the sequence in which they pitch, is known as the &quot;rotation&quot;. A team&#x27;s best starter is known as the ace, and is almost always the first man to pitch in the rotation. In modern baseball, a five-man rotation is most common.

In contrast, a pitcher who enters the game after the first pitch of the game is a relief pitcher. Occasionally, an opener is used for only a few innings, and is replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher.

==Workload==

Under ideal circumstances, a manager of a baseball team would prefer a starting pitcher to pitch as many innings as possible in a game. Most regular starting pitchers pitch for at least five innings on a regular basis, and if a pitcher is unable to do so, there is a high probability that he will, in the future, be relegated to duty in the bullpen. In modern baseball, a starting pitcher is rarely expected to pitch for more than seven or eight innings, at which point, responsibility for the game is passed to &quot;relief&quot; pitchers, including &quot;specialist&quot; pitchers such as setup pitchers and closers.

Often, a starting pitcher is subject to a pitch count, meaning the manager will remove him from the game once he has thrown a specific number of pitches. The most common pitch count for a modern pitcher is about 100, and it is now rare for a starting pitcher to throw more than 125 pitches in a game. Pitch count limits are especially common for starting pitchers who are recovering from injury.

At the youth level, such as in Little League Baseball, pitch counts are usually capped at a certain point as well as required rest before a pitcher can pitch again.

In the 2018 MLB season, the Tampa Bay Rays debuted a variant of the starting pitcher dubbed the &quot;opener,&quot; whose role is a hybrid between those of the traditional starting pitcher and the closer. In the opener strategy, a relief pitcher starts the game and pitches the first one or two innings (when guaranteed to face the top hitters in the opponent&#x27;s lineup) before giving way to a long reliever to work the middle innings of the game. On some occasions, teams would use multiple relievers who could pitch only one or two innings after the opener; this became known as a &quot;bullpen game&quot;. Due to their lighter workload and conditioning, openers are able to pitch more frequently than a traditional starter.

In the early decades of baseball, it was not uncommon for a starting pitcher to pitch 300 innings or more, over the course of a season. In addition, there are accounts of starting pitchers pitching on consecutive days, or even in both games of a doubleheader. It is believed that these feats were only possible because pitchers in the early years of the game, unlike modern starters, rarely threw the ball with maximum effort.

A starting pitcher who can be counted on to consistently throw many innings is known as a &quot;workhorse&quot;. An example of a modern-day workhorse pitcher was Roy Halladay, who was the active leader in both complete games thrown and shutouts before his retirement in 2013.

A pitcher that normally isn&#x27;t a regular member of a team&#x27;s starting rotation that situationally starts a game is commonly referred to as a &quot;spot starter.&quot; Pitchers that make spot starts are often relief pitchers mainly long-relief pitchers out of the bullpen that are tasked to pitch multiple innings or a starting pitcher that is promoted from a club&#x27;s minor league team to make sporadic starts. Spot starts typically occur because of emergency instances like a sudden injury to a scheduled starting pitcher in the rotation, or if there are multiple doubleheaders requiring a tight workload.

==Statistics==
A starting pitcher must complete five innings of work in order to qualify for a &quot;win&quot; in a game he starts. Under NCAA baseball rules, which govern intercollegiate baseball, a starting pitcher who pitches fewer than five innings can still earn a win if he pitches for a certain amount of time that is determined before the start of the game. It is possible to be credited with a loss despite pitching fewer than five innings. A starter who works six or more innings while giving up three or fewer earned runs is said to have achieved a &quot;quality start&quot;. A starter who finishes the game without having to be relieved by the bullpen is said to have thrown a &quot;complete game&quot;. The pitcher who throws a complete game is almost always in a position for a win.

==Pitch selection==
Starting pitchers usually have a variety of pitches to choose from, broken into a number of categories.

*Fastballs: A pitch thrown hard (anywhere from the upper 80s to over 100 mph) and which generally follows a mostly straight trajectory. There are a number of different types of fastballs. The four-seam fastball is the hardest thrown pitch, but also has very little movement or break to it. The two-seam fastball is slightly slower than the four-seam fastball (generally in the mid 80s to low 90s), but breaks slightly inward to the pitcher&#x27;s throwing arm as well as dropping slightly (i.e., a left-handed pitcher throwing a two-seam fastball will have it tail slightly right-to-left). The movement and velocity of the sinker is similar to that of the two-seamer, though sinkers tend to break earlier than two-seamers. The cut fastball (cutter) is similar to the two-seam fastball in velocity, but breaks to the opposite side of a pitcher&#x27;s throwing arm (i.e., a right-handed pitcher will have it break right-to-left).
*Hard breaking balls: The most prominent of the hard breaking balls is the slider. A slider is a pitch that breaks sharply in the direction of the pitcher&#x27;s arm travel (left to right for a left-handed pitcher). It travels slower than a fastball (usually in the 80s), but faster than the slower breaking balls. The other hard breaking ball, the split-finger fastball (splitter), mimics the fastball. The splitter breaks late in its flight path and downwards from the point of release, with a little bit of tailing action. The split-finger is usually thrown in the low to upper 80s, although some travel upwards of 90 mph.
*Soft breaking balls: The most common soft breaking ball is the eponymous curveball. The curve breaks in the direction of the pitcher&#x27;s arm travel from the point of release on through the entire arc of its flight. If one were to look at a clock, a straight drop curveball would be 12–6. A right hander with slightly more lateral break will have a curveball breaking in a 1–7 manner or with more lateral movement in a 2–8 manner. A left hander that throws a curveball with more lateral break will either have an 11–5 or 10–4 curveball. Curveballs travel from the low 60s to mid 80s in speed. The other soft breaking ball is the screwball, which is essentially a reverse curveball, as it breaks in the opposite direction of the pitcher&#x27;s arm travel. The screwball is a fairly rare pitch in modern baseball, due in part to a widespread belief that it causes damage to the arm. However, a 2014 &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation concluded that this belief is unfounded, and that the screwball causes no more injury than any other pitch.
*Other off-speed pitches: Two other major off-speed pitches are used by pitchers today, one far more so than others. The changeup, which has variants such as the circle changeup, the vulcan changeup or the palmball, is a slow pitch that is thrown with the same arm motion and arm velocity of a fastball, but with a much different grip that keeps the ball from achieving the same speed; usually the changeup is 10–20 mph slower than the pitcher&#x27;s fastballs. This visual distortion from a fast arm swing and a slower pitch is used to disrupt the hitter&#x27;s timing. The other major off-speed pitch is the knuckleball. The knuckleball is a very difficult pitch to master, both for the pitcher (due to its unique grip and delivery manner) and for his catcher (due to the pitch being thoroughly unpredictable in its travel).

<text>Unreal Tournament 2004 is a first-person arena shooter video game developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes. Part of the &quot;Unreal&quot; franchise, it is the third game in the &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; series and the updated version of &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;.

Among significant changes to gameplay mechanics and visual presentation, one of the major additions introduced by &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; is the inclusion of vehicles and the Onslaught game type, allowing for large-scale battles.

A sequel, &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot;, was released on November 19, 2007.

In December 2022, the servers for all games in the series were closed. Currently, no games in the series, including &quot;UT2004&quot;, are available for purchase on any digital platforms and stores. Epic Games has not yet announced the reason for this decision.

== Plot ==
The game is set in a universe where humans long before fought a war with the Skaarj, leaving their galactic empire in shambles. To assist in the rebuilding of the colonies by calming down enraged colonists, the Liandri Corporation came up with the idea of staging a gladiatorial tournament for the miners. The interest was so high that it grew into a sport, with sponsored teams battling in specially made arenas.

From the beginning, Xan Kriegor, a robot, reigned as champion in the Tournament, until Malcolm, then leading the team Thunder Crash, defeated him and proceeded to merge with the other popular team at the time – the Iron Guard, led by Brock. In last year&#x27;s tournament, they were defeated by the Juggernauts, led by gene-boosted monster Gorge.

The game takes place as the Tournament enters its 10th year. Malcolm is back with his old team Thunder Crash and trying to reclaim his title as champion, Brock is back with the Iron Guard and trying for the glory of his own and Gorge and the Juggernauts are there to defend their title. Additionally, the Skaarj Empire has sent a team of their own to the tournament in search of honor and glory and ex-champion Xan Kriegor has had some modifications and is back to return the title where it belongs.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; is a first-person shooter representing a fast-paced extreme sport of the future. The game, designed primarily for multiplayer gameplay, offers multiple ways of movement including double-jumping, dodge-jumping, wall-dodging and shield-jumping. &quot;UT2004&quot; also features an extensive array of weapons, all of which come with a secondary fire. Some of them were designed specifically for use in vehicle-based game types, and typically appear only in those game types such as the Anti-Vehicle Rocket Launcher (AVRiL) and the Grenade Launcher. More than 100 maps are included in the game for all new and existing game types.

=== Gametypes ===
The available game types are:

* Assault: An objective-oriented game type in which one team attacks the objectives (usually one at a time in a specific order) while another defends. Often, attackers will be rewarded for completing an objective by being allowed to spawn closer to the next objective. If the attacking team completes the final objective within the allowed time, the teams switch roles and another round on the same map begins. If not, the original attackers lose. If a second round begins and the new attackers complete the final objective in less time than the first attackers, they win; if not, they lose. 
* Onslaught or ONS is a vehicle-based game mode in which the objective is to capture a series of power nodes connecting the player and their opponents&#x27; bases and destroy the power core located within their base. First team to destroy opponents&#x27; power core wins.
* Bombing Run: Each level has a ball that starts in the middle of the playing field. The player&#x27;s team scores by getting the ball through the enemy team&#x27;s hoop. The player scores 7 points for jumping through the hoop while holding the ball and 3 points for tossing the ball through the hoop. The player holding the ball cannot use weapons but can pass the ball to teammates. The ball is dropped if the player is killed. 
* Capture the Flag: The player&#x27;s team must score flag captures by taking the enemy flag from the enemy base and returning it to their own flag. If the flag carrier is killed, the flag drops to the ground for anyone to pick up. If the player&#x27;s team&#x27;s flag is taken, it must be returned (by touching it after it is dropped) before their team can score a flag capture.
* Deathmatch or DM, is a game type, in which the point is to either reach a certain number of frags (or kills) or to the highest number of frags at the time limit for the match.
* Team Deathmatch: Two teams duke it out in a quest for battlefield supremacy. The team with the most frags wins.
* Invasion: It is a simple survival mode. The players are forced to work together to try and survive endless waves of monsters from &quot;Unreal&quot; that get increasingly difficult with each wave. Once a player dies they cannot respawn until the round is over. Rounds can either end after a time limit (victory) or when all players are dead (failure).
* Double Domination: The player&#x27;s team scores by capturing and holding both Control Points for ten seconds. Control Points are captured by touching them. After scoring, the Control Points are reset to neutral.
* Last Man Standing: Each player starts with a limited number of lives. The last remaining player to still have lives wins the match.
* Mutant: All players start in a deathmatch setting with all weapons, and the first player to kill becomes the &quot;mutant&quot;. This player receives unlimited ammo, camouflage, Berserk (increases rate of fire and knockback) and super speed for an indefinite amount of time, but he slowly loses health and cannot pick up any health items. When the mutant is killed, the mutant powers are passed to the killer.

=== Vehicles ===
There are many vehicles available in &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;. Most of them make an appearance in the Onslaught game type, while a few feature in Assault. The full set consists of aircraft types and vehicles. There are also two spacecraft which only officially feature in one Assault map and different types of gun turrets which players can take control of.

==Development==

&quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; was built with Unreal Engine 2.5 and the content of its predecessor, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;. The game was developed by multiple studios, with Epic Games leading the project. Lead programmer Steve Polge described the role of each company involved:

;Epic Games
:Enhancements to the &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; game types, the new user interface, voice over IP and bot voice command support, engine enhancements and optimizations. They made an improved single-player game, and improved community and demo recording support, in addition to thirty-one new playable characters. A sniper rifle similar to the one included in the original &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; was added. They created one Onslaught map, and developed AI support for Onslaught. 16 DM maps, five capture the flag maps, two Double Domination maps and one Bombing Run map were added. The Assault gametype design and implementation were also reintroduced from the original &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;.
;Digital Extremes
:Three deathmatch maps, six capture the flag maps, two Bombing Run maps, and three Double Domination maps, two playable characters, a new HUD design; weapon models for the assault rifle, shock rifle, and link gun.
; Psyonix
:The Onslaught gametype design and implementation, with six vehicles, four weapons (grenade launcher, Spider Mine Layer, Anti-Vehicular Rocket Launcher (AVRiL), and the Phoenix Target Painter), and the energy turret. They created seven Onslaught maps, and collaborated with Streamline Studios on the popular map ONS-Torlan. They made the model for the Translocator, a portable teleporter.
;Streamline Studios
:The single-player introduction movie and ONS-Torlan in collaboration with Psyonix. Streamline Studios created the Assault map AS-Confexia as a test for ONS-Torlan, which they released for free.

==Release==
A playable demo was released for multiple platforms in February 2004, including Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux on x86-32, and Linux on x86-64. An updated demo version, including all the bug fixes from official patches and some original content, was released on September 23 of the same year.

After being delayed from a late 2003 release, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; was released in March 2004 in North America and Europe, for the PC (Linux x86-32/x86-64 and Windows). At release, the game could be purchased as a standard six-disc CD-ROM release or a special edition DVD-ROM release that included a Logitech microphone headset and a second DVD filled with video-tutorials on how to use the included UnrealEd. The European DVD release did not include the bonus extras. A DVD-ROM release without the microphone followed suit in the United States on April 13. All original PC versions of the game included a $10 mail-in rebate requiring that a short form be completed and sent to the publisher along with a copy of the manual cover for &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;, although in Europe the rebate required sending in the play CD for &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot; instead. Mac OS X version (DVD only) followed on March 31.

In summer 2004, Epic and Atari, in collaboration, released an &quot;XP Levels&quot; downloadable map pack, which included two Onslaught maps, ONS-Ascendancy and ONS-Aridoom. The pack is free for download and use on any system capable of running the game.

In September 2004, Atari released in stores the &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice Edition&quot; of &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; which adds three vehicles, four Onslaught maps, and six character skins to the original game, and contains several mods developed by the community as selected by Epic Games. This extension (excluding mods) was released as a Bonus Pack by Atari on September 23, and is available for free download.

The version for Windows x86-64 was released as a downloadable patch on October 1, 2005.

In December 2005, the Mega Bonus Pack was released online by Epic Games, which included several new maps, along with the latest patch and the Editor&#x27;s Choice Edition content.

In June 2006, Midway Games acquired the publishing rights to the &quot;Unreal&quot; back catalog from Infogrames and Atari. That November, Midway released &quot;Unreal Anthology&quot;, a bundle that includes &quot;Unreal Gold&quot;, &quot;Unreal II: The Awakening&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; (Game of the Year edition), and &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;.

In March 2008, Epic Games released the game on Valve&#x27;s digital distribution service Steam, and was also included as part of the &quot;Unreal Deal Pack&quot;, followed later in the year by the &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice Edition&quot; on GOG.com.

Subsequent Midway edition of &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; omits Linux installer from DVD game content.

==Music==
The soundtrack for &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; was composed by Kevin Riepl, Starsky Partridge, and Will Nevins. It contains grand orchestral scores, hard rock, and minimalistic electronic songs. The game also includes almost all tracks from &quot;Unreal Tournament 2003&quot;.

==Modification==
&quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; includes extensive modification support which allows users to easily create maps, models, game modes as well as various other additions to the game. The game features a flexible modification system which seamlessly blends custom content with the original, as well as allowing for easy tweaking of the game with the &quot;mutator&quot; system.

In 2004, Epic Games held the &quot;Make Something Unreal Contest&quot;, which rewarded the creators of the best-submitted modifications with prizes in cash, computer hardware, and, ultimately, a license for commercial use of Unreal Engine 2 and 3. &quot;Red Orchestra&quot;, a total conversion modification based on the Eastern Front of World War II and focused on realism-oriented gameplay, was the winner of the contest and is currently available as a retail title on Steam.

&quot;Alien Swarm&quot; was the winner of Phase 4 of the Make Something Unreal Contest for best non-first-person shooter modification. In 2010, the game was released as a standalone game for free, based on the Source engine instead of the Unreal Engine.

&quot;Killing Floor&quot; was originally a total conversion mod for the game &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;, first released in 2005. The retail release followed on May 14, 2009. Its sequel, &quot;Killing Floor 2&quot;, was released in 2016.

The developers of the acclaimed 2003 game modification &quot;Deathball&quot; were awarded grant money from Epic to develop &quot;Supraball&quot; in 2014.

The game served as a platform for the Computer game bot Turing Test competition, also known as BotPrize.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; was met with universal acclaim. Several critics praised the unique, fast-paced, fun and challenging nature of the game as its main selling points, while fans touted the post-release support and extensive modding capabilities. The game holds a score of 94% on GameRankings and a score of 93/100 on Metacritic.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; the best computer game of March 2004. It received runner-up placements in GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Shooter&quot; and &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; award categories across all platforms, losing to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;, respectively. It was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s list of 2004&#x27;s top 10 computer games, but it won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Multiplayer&quot; award.

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; received nominations for &quot;Computer First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay&quot;.

In March 2014, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; as the 70th best game on their &quot;Top 100 Best Video Games of All Time&quot; list.

<doc id="474280" wikidata="Q2669115" url="?curid=474280" title="Vakhushti of Kartli">
<text>Vakhushti (; 1696 – 1757) was a Georgian royal prince (&quot;batonishvili&quot;), geographer, historian and cartographer. His principal historical and geographic works, &quot;Description of the Kingdom of Georgia&quot; and the &quot;Geographical Atlas&quot;, were inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2013.

== Life ==
Born as a royal bastard, son of King Vakhtang VI of Kartli (ruled 1716–24), he was born in Tbilisi, 1696. Educated by the brothers Garsevanishvili and a Roman Catholic mission, he was fluent in Greek, Latin, French, Turkish, Russian and Armenian.

His name Vakhushti derives from Old Iranian &quot;vahišta-&quot; (&quot;paradise&quot;, superlative of &quot;veh&quot; &quot;good&quot;, i.e., &quot;superb, excellent&quot;). Its equivalent in Middle Persian is &quot;wahišt&quot; and in New Persian &quot;behešt&quot;.

In 1719 and 1720, he took part in two successive campaigns against the rebel duke (&quot;eristavi&quot;) Shanshe of the Ksani. From August to November 1722, he was a governor of the kingdom during his father&#x27;s absence at the Ganja campaign. Later he served as a commander in Kvemo Kartli. After the Ottoman occupation of Kartli, he followed King Vakhtang in his emigration to the Russian Empire in 1724. Retired to Moscow, Tsarevich Vakhusht (as he came to be known in Russia) was granted a pension. He died at Moscow in 1757. He was buried at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow, a traditional burial ground of Georgian emigrant royalty and nobility.

== Works ==

Most of his works were written or completed in Moscow. The best known are &quot;Description of the Kingdom of Georgia&quot; (completed in 1745), &quot;The Geographic Description of Georgia&quot; (completed in 1750) and two geographic atlases of the Caucasus region accompanied by the images of several historic coats of arms (1745–46). 

His famous &quot;Description of the Kingdom of Georgia&quot; is essentially an adorned synopsis of the initial texts of the corpus of medieval Georgian annals, &quot;Kartlis Tskhovreba&quot;. Vakhushti was critical of the re-edition of the corpus assembled by a scholarly commission chaired by his father Vakhtang VI. So as to rectify perceived oversights of Vakhtang&#x27;s version, Vakhushti compiled his own comprehensive history and geographical description of the Georgian people and lands. One of the chief goals of his corrective was to underscore all-Georgian political and cultural unity despite the fact that Georgia was politically divided among competing kings and princes during Vakhushti&#x27;s lifetime. The popularity of Vakhushti&#x27;s tome is evidenced by the many copies made of it, and his narrative significantly shaped the way in which subsequent generations have conceived of an all-Georgian past. It is also a major source on the Georgian history of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Vakhushti&#x27;s works were soon translated into Russian and later into French and served as a guide to many contemporary European scholars and travelers to Caucasus up to the early 20th century.

He also completed, together with his brother, Prince Bakar, the printing of the Bible in Georgian, which he had been only partly done by their father, Vakhtang VI. He established for that purpose, in his house near Moscow, a printing-press, taught the art of printing to several Georgian clergymen, and completed the first printed edition of the Bible in Georgian in 1743. The printing-press was afterwards transferred to Moscow, where several religious works in Georgian were printed.

== Family ==
Vakhushti married in 1717 Mariam, youngest daughter of Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze, ex-King of Imereti (1702–07), and had several children:

* Prince Ioane (1719–1781), general in the Russian service;
* Princess Alexandra (12 August 1721 – 8 April 1789);
* Prince David (1723–1819);
* Princess Mariam (1724–1807); 
* Prince Domenti (1728–1737);
* Prince Nikoloz (died 6 November 1784);
* Princess Anna (1744–1779);
* Prince Iotam (fl. 1737);
* Prince Petre (fl. 1737);
* Princess Guka (fl. 1737).

<doc id="474282" wikidata="Q1198553" url="?curid=474282" title="Relief pitcher">
<text>In baseball and softball, a relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who pitches in the game after the starting pitcher or another relief pitcher has been removed from the game due to fatigue, injury, ineffectiveness, ejection, high pitch count, or for other strategic reasons, such as inclement weather delays or pinch hitter substitutions. Relief pitchers are further divided informally into various roles, such as closers, setup men, middle relief pitchers, left/right-handed specialists, and long relievers. Whereas starting pitchers usually throw so many pitches in a single game that they must rest several days before pitching in another, relief pitchers are expected to be more flexible and typically pitch in more games with a shorter time period between pitching appearances but with fewer innings pitched per appearance. A team&#x27;s staff of relievers is normally referred to metonymically as a team&#x27;s bullpen, which refers to the area where the relievers sit during games, and where they warm-up prior to entering the game.

== History ==

===Pre-bullpen===
In the early days of Major League Baseball (MLB), substituting a player was not allowed except for sickness or injury. An ineffective pitcher would switch positions with another player on the field. The first relief appearance in the major leagues was in 1876 with Boston Red Caps outfielder Jack Manning switching positions with pitcher Joe Borden. In this early era, relief pitchers changing from a position role to the pitcher&#x27;s box in this way were often called &quot;change&quot; pitchers. This strategy of switching players between the mound and the outfield is still occasionally employed in modern baseball, sometimes in long extra inning games where a team is running out of players. In 1889, the first bullpen appearance occurred after rules were changed to allow a player substitution at any time. Early relief pitchers were normally starting pitchers pitching one or two innings in between starts. In 1903, during the second game of the inaugural World Series, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Bucky Veil became the first relief pitcher in World Series history.

===Early modern relievers/&quot;firemen&quot;===

Firpo Marberry is credited with being the first prominent reliever. From 1923 to 1935, he pitched in 551 games, 364 of which were in relief. Baseball historian Bill James wrote that Marberry was &quot;a modern reliever—a hard throwing young kid who worked strictly in relief, worked often, and was used to nail down victories&quot;. Another reliever, Johnny Murphy, became known as &quot;Fireman&quot; for his effectiveness when inserted into difficult situations (&quot;put out fires&quot;) in relief.

Nonetheless, the full-time reliever who was entrusted with important situations was more the exception than the rule at this point. Often, a team&#x27;s ace starting pitcher was used in between his starts to &quot;close&quot; games. Later research would reveal that Lefty Grove would have been in his league&#x27;s top three in saves in four different seasons, had that stat been invented at the time.

Gradually after World War II, full-time relievers became more acceptable and standard. The relievers were usually pitchers that were not good enough to be starters. Relievers in the 1950s started to develop oddball pitches to distinguish them from starters. For example, Hoyt Wilhelm threw a knuckleball, and Elroy Face threw a forkball.

In 1969, the pitcher&#x27;s mound was lowered and umpires were encouraged to call fewer strikes to give batters an advantage. Relief specialists were used to counter the increase in offense.

===Closer era===

Relievers became more respected in the 1970s, and their pay increased due to free agency. All teams began having a closer. The 1980s were the first time in MLB that the number of saves outnumbered complete games. In 1995, there were nearly four saves for every complete game. It is unclear whether the specialization and reliance on relief pitchers led to pitch counts and fewer complete games, or whether pitch counts led to greater use of relievers.

As closers were reduced to one-inning specialists, setup men and middle relievers became more prominent.

In past decades, the relief pitcher was merely an ex-starter who came into a game upon the injury, ineffectiveness, or fatigue of the starting pitcher. The bullpen was for old starters who had lost the ability to throw effectively. Many of these pitchers would be able to flourish in this diminished role. Those such as Dennis Eckersley, as with many others, actually prolonged their tapering careers and often sparked them to new life. The added rest to their arms as well as the lessened exposure of their abilities became an advantage many would learn to capitalize on. Because these pitchers only faced some batters once a season, the opposing side would have greater difficulty preparing to face relief pitchers.

Recently, being a relief pitcher has become more of a career, rather than a reduced position. Many of today&#x27;s top prospects are considered mainly for their relief pitching skills. In the quest for a managerial edge, managers as time goes on have carried more pitchers in the bullpen, and used them in more specialized situations. Acknowledgment of the platoon edge has prompted managers to ensure that opposing lefty hitters face as many lefty pitchers as possible, and that the same occur with respect to righty hitters and pitchers. Tony La Russa was particularly well known for making frequent pitching changes on this basis.

When Mike Marshall set the all-time record with 106 games pitched in 1974, he threw 208.1 innings. Currently, although some relievers still do appear in a large number of games per season, the workload for each individual pitcher has been much reduced. Since 2008, Pedro Feliciano has three of the top four seasons in games pitched, with 92, 88 and 86. However, Feliciano only averaged 58 innings pitched during those seasons. The last pitcher to throw 100 or more innings in a season without starting a game was Scott Proctor in 2006.

From the mid-2010s onward, MLB teams have given relievers an increasing number of innings at the expense of starters, due to the baseball game moving towards higher variance, and a flexible bullpen does give the manager more options of defending against high risk offensive strategies. In response, some teams have allocated funds and made trades to create a &quot;super bullpen&quot;, nonetheless this is no guarantee of success since the performance of relief pitchers has been shown to fluctuate much more wildly than starting pitchers. For instance the 2016 and 2017 Cleveland Indians had the strongest bullpen in the league, however their bullpen in 2018 struggled and the Indians won their division thanks to the strength of their starting rotation. Similarly the 2019 Washington Nationals won the 2019 World Series in spite of their relief pitching staff having the worst ERA (5.66) that season.

==Current relief roles==
Pitching staffs on MLB teams have grown from 9 or 10 to as many as 12 or 13 pitchers, due to the increased importance of relief pitching. The staff generally consists of five starting pitchers, with the remaining pitchers assigned as relievers. A team&#x27;s relief staff usually contains a closer who generally pitches the ninth inning, a setup pitcher who generally pitches the eighth, and a left-handed specialist whose job is to retire left-handed batters. The rest of the bullpen then consists of middle relievers who are used in the remaining situations, and perhaps additional left-handed or right-handed specialists.

The closer is usually the best relief pitcher, followed by the setup man. Players typically get promoted into later-inning roles as they succeed. Relievers were previously more multipurpose before becoming one-inning specialists.

The setup man and closer will normally only be used to preserve a lead, although they may enter to maintain a close game (where the score is tied or if their team is trailing by only a few runs) particularly in the playoffs. If the team is significantly behind going into the eighth or ninth inning and a relief pitcher is required, usually a middle reliever or two will be chosen to soak up innings, while the setup man and closer are saved for the next time they are needed to preserve a win. The proper use of the bullpen is to avoid using an effective reliever on a low-leverage situation, instead saving them as &quot;fireman&quot; for high-leverage situations (such as bases-loaded, no-outs).

In 2018, some MLB teams began experimenting with an opener – a pitcher who is normally a reliever that starts the game for an inning or two before yielding to someone who would normally be a starter. Sometimes the manager replaces an opener with a series of other relievers who would only pitch one or two innings in a game, usually due to injury or fatigue affecting the team&#x27;s starters or other strategical reasons; this approach became known as a &quot;bullpen game&quot;. One advantage of this approach is that the opener, who is often a hard-throwing specialist, can be called in to face the most dangerous hitters, who are usually near the top of the batting order, the first time they come to bat. Although the opener has only been formally regarded as a relief role in 2018, managers have sporadically used a reliever before a starter. A good example is Game 6 of the 1990 National League Championship Series when Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland started a set-up man, Ted Power, in order to keep the Cincinnati Reds from employing their successful platoon (Power pitched innings prior to giving way to lefty starter Zane Smith in the third inning) and the strategy worked in holding the Reds to only two runs; to deceive his opponents Leyland had announced the Game 6 starter at a press conference so that the Reds would set their batting order around Smith.

==Starting pitchers as relievers==
Between their scheduled starts in the rotation, a starting pitcher can be used on short rest for the bullpen. They are sometimes used as relievers when the stakes are higher, such as a game that could decide the division title or an elimination (winner-take all) playoff game. Currently, starters are typically used in relief situations either early in the postseason prior to their scheduled rotation start, or late in the postseason after their last scheduled start (often with &quot;the ultimatum of a series clincher&quot;). However, the 2018 Boston Red Sox under Alex Cora managed their pitching rotation such that a starter was readily available in the bullpen every playoff game.

Regarded as an &quot;almost universal truth in baseball&quot;, &quot;almost every starting pitcher would be better in relief&quot;. However, a starter may not necessarily be best used as a &quot;fireman&quot; (to stop a rally) since &quot;the conventional wisdom is that it’s unwise to bring a starter in for a relief appearance with men already on base; starting pitchers take longer to warm up than relievers and tend to be most comfortable when coming in at the start of an inning with the bases empty&quot;.

A good example of starters in relief was in the deciding Game 6 of the 2010 NLCS, where the San Francisco Giants bullpen utilized two starters as well as three regular relievers to get seven scoreless innings. In Game 6 of the 2010 ALCS, manager Joe Girardi was criticized for &quot;managing by formula&quot; in not calling upon ace CC Sabathia and instead going to reliever David Robertson who surrendered several runs that put the game out of reach for the New York Yankees.

Starter Madison Bumgarner recorded the longest save in World Series history, pitching five scoreless innings of relief in a Game 7 3–2 victory of the 2014 edition. In the 2018 World Series, starter Nathan Eovaldi, originally slated to pitch Game 4, was inserted in relief during Game 3 which turned into an 18-inning marathon. In making World Series history, he became the first reliever to throw at least six innings after Rick Rhoden did so in 1977, while Eovaldi&#x27;s 97 pitches set the record for the most by a reliever (and also 36 more pitches than Rick Porcello who had started that game).

In the clinching Games of the 2018 NLCS and 2018 World Series, respectively, aces Clayton Kershaw (for Kenley Jansen) and Chris Sale (for Craig Kimbrel, indeed the other pitcher warming up besides Sale was another starter, Nathan Eovaldi) pitched the ninth-inning in lieu of their team&#x27;s regular closer. Neither relief entrance was a high pressure situation as their teams were already leading 5-1 entering the 9th; but it gave Sale the opportunity to get the final outs of the series (Sale also got the first outs of the series when he started the opener).

==Position players as relievers==

In games where a blowout is occurring, position players (non-pitchers) may be substituted in to pitch to save the bullpen for the next game. However, this is a rare occurrence as position players are not truly trained as pitchers, and tend to throw with less velocity and/or accuracy. There is also the increased risk of injury, such as Jose Canseco who suffered a season-ending arm injury after pitching two innings in a 1993 game. For these reasons, managers will typically only use a position player as a pitcher in a blowout loss, or in order to avoid a forfeit once they have run out of available pitchers. Typically, the position player also pitched at the high school or collegiate level, as smaller roster sizes at amateur levels forced some position players to pitch, with some were recruited in college also as pitchers, as starters or relievers. Mitch Moreland (Mississippi State), Ryan Rua (Lake Erie College), and J. D. Davis, (Cal State Fullerton) all played as both position players and pitchers in their collegiate careers, with Rua and Davis both being closers for their college teams.

Cliff Pennington became the first position player in Major League Baseball history to pitch in a postseason game, which was during Game 4 of the 2015 American League Championship Series. The second position player to pitch in the playoffs was Austin Romine during Game 3 of the 2018 American League Division Series.

Starting in , MLB position players are allowed to pitch in a game under the following conditions:
*The leading team can only use a position player in this role in the ninth inning, and with a lead of at least 10 runs.
*A team behind by eight or more runs can use a position player to pitch at any time in the game.
*The use of position players as pitchers in extra innings is unrestricted.

==Awards given to relievers==

The Major League Baseball Reliever of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award are annually voted on and presented to relievers, with the former being split by league into the &quot;Trevor Hoffman NL Reliever of the Year Award&quot; and the &quot;Mariano Rivera AL Reliever of the Year Award&quot;. The former equivalent award for both leagues combined until 2012, the Rolaids Relief Man Award, was determined by a statistical formula.

Compared to starting pitchers, most relievers (with the except of closers with large save totals) receive few awards and honors. Historically, setup men were rarely selected to MLB All-Star Games, with the relievers selected usually being closers. A setup man has never won the Cy Young Award or the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award; the highest placements in these respective awards have been achieved by Rivera, who finished third in the voting for the American League (AL) Cy Young Award and twelfth for the AL MVP in 1996, and for the next season he was promoted to closer. Middle reliever Andrew Miller became the first relief pitcher other than a closer to win a League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award when he was voted the 2016 ALCS MVP.

Setup pitchers typically make less than the MLB average salary. Relief pitchers further down the line may be journeymen as their individual performances may vary greatly (often specialised to pitch against certain types of batters, such as to right-handed batters only or left-handed batters only), even though their team&#x27;s relief pitching staff as a whole is overall effective.

The rising importance placed on relief pitchers is evident in the rising star power of the closer. It has gotten to the point where closers are among the biggest stars in the game, with status and salaries on par with starting pitchers. When closers play at home, and when they are called into the game to preserve a lead for the crucial last inning or those last couple of outs, many of them trot in from the bullpen to the pitchers mound accompanied by a theme song of their choice. For many years with the Yankees, Rivera entered the game accompanied by Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; booming over Yankee Stadium&#x27;s sound system. When Jonathan Papelbon was with the Red Sox, his entry song was the Dropkick Murphys&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Shipping Up to Boston&quot;, and Hoffman entered to the tune of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Hells Bells&quot;.

Nine pitchers are currently in the Baseball Hall of Fame chiefly for their accomplishments as relief pitchers: Hoyt Wilhelm, Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Lee Smith, Mariano Rivera, and Billy Wagner. Eckersley, who was considered the first modern closer pitching exclusively in ninth inning situations, also had a significant career as a starting pitcher and even threw a no-hitter in 1977. Another pitcher entering the Hall in , John Smoltz, was primarily a starter, but spent four seasons as a reliever.

Jim Konstanty in 1950 was the first reliever to win the MLB MVP Award after a then-record 74 games, 16–7 record, 22 saves, and a 2.66 ERA. Mike Marshall in 1974 was the first reliever to win the Cy Young Award after a record 106 games, 15–12 record, 21 saves, and 208 innings pitched. In 1992, Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth inning situations) to win the Cy Young, and since then only one other relief pitcher has won the Cy Young, Éric Gagné in 2003 (also a closer). Three relief pitchers have won both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in a single season; Fingers in 1981, Willie Hernández in 1984, and Eckersley in 1992.

<text>Adolphus Egerton Ryerson (24 March 1803 – 19 February 1882) was a Canadian educator, author, editor, and Methodist minister who was a prominent contributor to the design of the Canadian public school system. Ryerson is considered to be the founder of the Ontario public school system.

An advocate against Christian sectarianism and control of Upper Canada by the wealthy Anglican elite, Ryerson staunchly opposed Clergy Reserves and promoted a system of free public education in Canada. Conversely, Ryerson was passionate about Christianization, favouring missionary work and protesting the removal of the Bible from Ontario schools.

Following his time as a missionary to the Mississaugas of the Credit River, Ryerson became founding editor of &quot;The Christian Guardian&quot;, and the first principal of Victoria College. He was appointed as Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada by Governor General Sir Charles Metcalfe in 1844, where he supported reforms such as creating school boards, making textbooks more uniform, and making education free. His extensive contributions to early education in Ontario led to him being memorialized with statues, and in the naming of several institutions and places in Ontario.

Ryerson was involved in formulating and founding the Indian residential school system.

==Early years==

Ryerson was born on 24 March 1803 in Charlotteville Township, Upper Canada, to Joseph Ryerson (1761–1854), a United Empire Loyalist, a Lieutenant in the Prince of Wales&#x27; American Volunteers from Passaic County, New Jersey, and Sarah Mehetable Ryerson (née Stickney). He was one of six brothers – George, Samuel, William, John, and Edwy. Samuel was the only one of Egerton&#x27;s brothers not to enter the Methodist ministry.

==Methodist missionary==

He joined the Methodist Episcopal Church at 17, and was forced to leave home by his Anglican father. After leaving home, Ryerson worked as an usher in a London grammar school, before his father sent for him to return home. He did so and farmed for a small period of time before leaving again, this time to Hamilton to attend Gore District Grammar School. In Hamilton, he studied Latin and Greek with such fervor that he became ill with a fever that almost claimed his life. This enabled him to become a Methodist missionary or circuit rider. His first post was the York region surrounding Yonge Street. The circuit took four weeks to complete on foot or horseback, as it encompassed areas with roads in extremely poor condition. However, the experience gave Ryerson a first hand look at the life of the early pioneer.

Ryerson was appointed as a missionary to the Mississaugas of the Credit in 1826, while still on probation as a Methodist missionary. His journal records his feelings on arrival: &quot;Sept. 16, 1826 —I have now arrived at my charge among the Indians. I feel an inexpressible joy in taking up my abode amongst them. I must now acquire a new language, to teach a new people.&quot; In an assembly, Ryerson explained to them the source of their misery: &quot;I explained to the assembled Indians, the cause of their poverty, misery and wretchedness as resulting from them offending the Great Being who created them but who still loved them so much as to send His Son to save them and give them new hearts, that they might forsake their bad ways, be sober and industrious; not quarrel, but love one another, etc.&quot; Ryerson assisted them in building a church which doubled as a school. He was experienced as a farmer and taught them about crops and crop rotation, fencing, etc. They had decided that they had to learn farming and settle down, as their hunting and fishing grounds were depleted by white settlers.

On 16 December, he reported: &quot;I have this week been trying to procure for the Indians the exclusive right of their salmon fishery, which I trust will be granted by the Legislature&quot;. At a meeting that same week an Ojibway chief addressed him: &quot;Brother, as we are brothers, we will give you a name. My departed brother was named Cheehock; thou shalt be called Cheehock.&quot; Ryerson &quot;returned him thanks in his own tongue, and so became initiated among them&quot;. The Legislature declined to support the Mississauga&#x27;s claims to land and fishing grounds. According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada report of May 2015, and noted that &quot;he even learned their language, worked in the fields with the people of the settlement and became a life-long friend of future chief Kahkewaquonaby (Sacred Feathers), known in English as Peter Jones&quot;. 

In 1826, sermons from John Strachan, Anglican Archdeacon of York, Upper Canada, were published asserting that the Anglican church was, by law, the established church of Upper Canada. Methodists were singled out as American and therefore disloyal. Money was requested of the crown to allow the Anglican church to maintain ties to Great Britain. As Ryerson was the son of a Loyalist, this was an abomination. He emerged as Episcopal Methodism&#x27;s most articulate defender in the public sphere by publishing articles (at first anonymously) and later books that argued against the views of Methodism&#x27;s chief rival John Strachan and other members of the powerful Family Compact.

Ryerson was also elected (by one vote) to serve as the founding editor of Canadian Methodism&#x27;s weekly denominational newspaper, the &quot;Christian Guardian&quot;, established in York in 1829 and which was also Canada&#x27;s first religious newspaper. Ryerson used the paper to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest. Ryerson was castigated by the reformist press at that time for apparently abandoning the cause of reform and becoming, at least as far as they were concerned, a Tory. Ryerson resigned the editorship in 1835 only to assume it again at his brother John&#x27;s urging from 1838 to 1840. In 1840 Ryerson allowed his name to stand for re-election one last time but was soundly defeated by a vote of 50 to 1.

==Educator==
In April 1831, Ryerson wrote in &quot;The Christian Guardian&quot; newspaper,
This quote is a fore-telling of Ryerson&#x27;s contribution to education in Upper Canada.

In 1836, Ryerson visited England to secure the charter for Upper Canada Academy. This was the first charter ever granted by the British Government to a Nonconformist body for an educational institution. When it was incorporated in 1841 under the name Victoria College Ryerson assumed the presidency. Victoria College continues to exist as part of the University of Toronto. Ryerson also fought for many secularization reforms, to keep power and influence away from any one church, particularly the Church of England in Upper Canada which had pretensions to establishment. His advocacy of Methodism contributed to the eventual sale of the Clergy Reserveslarge tracts of land that had been set aside for the &quot;maintenance of the Protestant clergy&quot; under the Constitutional Act of 1791. &quot;In honour of his achievements on behalf of the Methodist Church, Egerton Ryerson received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the Wesleyan University in Connecticut and served as President of the Church in Canada from 1874 to 1878.&quot;
Such secularization also led to the widening of the school system into public hands. Governor General Sir Charles Metcalfe asked him to become Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada in 1844 and remained in the position until 1876.

The Normal School at St. James Square was founded in Toronto in 1847, and became the province&#x27;s foremost teacher&#x27;s academy. It also housed the Department of Education as well as the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts, which became the Royal Ontario Museum. The school operated by the Ontario Society of Artists at the Normal School would become the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design. An agricultural laboratory on the site led to the later founding of the Ontario Agricultural College and the University of Guelph. St. James Square went through various other educational uses before it eventually became part of Ryerson University.

Ryerson University (later renamed Toronto Metropolitan University), Ryerson Press (McGraw-Hill Ryerson), and the Township of Ryerson in the Parry Sound District, Ontario, were named after him, as well as the small park, Ryerson Park, in the city of Owen Sound, at the northeast corner of 8th Street East and 5th Avenue East. There is also an intersection of two small streets in Toronto, Egerton Lane and Ryerson Avenue, between Spadina and Bathurst north of Queen Street West.

In 2017 the university was urged to change its name in response to a campaign in social media, student organizations and petitions. A process of consultation was engaged in. A Standing Strong Task Force appointed by the president. It held hearings, accepted briefs and letters and in 2021, reported with a recommendation to drop the name Ryerson and permanently remove his statue from the campus. This was promptly accepted by the University’s Board of Governors further consultations were held to determine the new name. In April 2022, the university announced the new name, Toronto Metropolitan University.

== Legislation ==

=== &quot;Common School Act&quot; of 1846 ===
Ryerson&#x27;s study of educational systems elsewhere in the Western world led to three school acts, which would revolutionize education in Canada. His major innovations included libraries in every school, an educational journal and professional development conventions for teachers, a central textbook press using Canadian authors, and securing land grants for universities.

The &quot;Common School Act&quot; of 1846, was an act that had established the First General School Board, where it would consist of Seven Members, that would each have their own responsibilities. Ryerson set the groundwork for compulsory education, which is what it has become today, he ensured that curriculums were made and that teaching and learning materials were provided and delivered to Schools, in the result of the best possible education. Ryerson did not believe that white and Aboriginal children should be taught in the same schools due to their different civilization and their upbringings.

==== Superintendent of Schools for Canada West ====
Ryerson observed that previous educational legislation, most notably the &quot;Common School Act&quot; of 1843, was ineffective due to the limited powers of authority of the Superintendent of Schools. By comparing the office of the Superintendent to a corresponding office in New York State, namely the &quot;State Superintendent&quot;, he noted that the 1843 Act allowed the Superintendent to draw up rules and responsibilities but no one was required to follow them. In his draft of the bill, he included several responsibilities of the Superintendent for Upper Canada: apportioning Legislature funds among the twenty district councils (in existence at that point in time), discouragement of unsuitable texts for classroom and school library usage (no common texts were the norm), provide direction for normal schools, prepare recommended plans for school houses and school libraries, dissemination of information, and annual reporting to the Governor General. This considerably expanded the role of Superintendent and placed significantly more responsibility upon the office.

Further, he established the first General Board of Education (the one established in 1823 was by order of the Lieutenant Governor not by legislation). The board consisted of the Superintendent and six other members nominated by the Governor General.

====District superintendents====
The bill provided provision for a new office, that of the District Superintendent. Ryerson recommended, although it did not become part of the legislation that followed from the 1846 bill, that as a savings measure the offices of Clerk of the District and District Superintendent be combined.

The District Superintendents became important civil servants, apportioning District School Funds in proportion of the number of students, teacher payment, visit all schools in their district; reporting on progress, advising teachers on school management, examining teachers&#x27; qualifications, revoking unqualified teachers, and preventing the use of unauthorized textbooks.

==== Common textbooks ====
Ryerson advocated for uniform school textbooks across Canada West. Again, benchmarking the New York system, he noted that an Act passed in 1843 gave the State Superintendent of Schools and county superintendents authority to reject any book in a school library. That system utilized University Regents to create a list of acceptable texts from which the schools purchased books. Ryerson did not propose absolute authority on book selection, rather, recommended that the Board of Education &quot;make out a list of School Text Books, in each branch of learning that they would recommend, and another list they would not permit leaving Trustees to select from these lists.&quot;

Ryerson was also responsible for developing the first Ontario Readers for Canadian students to replace British, Irish and American textbooks.

====Free schools====
With the intent of providing education for all Canadian children, Ryerson began lobbying for the idea of free schools in 1846. His convictions on the matter were strengthened after studying systems of education in New York State and Massachusetts where financial provision for education was a cardinal one. Ryerson pointed out that, in Toronto alone, less than half of the 4,450 children in the city were regular school attendees.

In his &quot;Circular to the County Municipalities&quot;, in 1846, he argued the following:

Ryerson was also determined to provide education to those less privileged, as a means of improving the opportunities of all; or as he described it as the &quot;only effectual remedy for the pernicious and pauperizing system which is at present. Many children are now kept from school on the alleged grounds of parental poverty.&quot; Ryerson was persuasive in his arguments such that principle for free education, in a permission form, was embodied into the School Law of 1850. Subsequent debate followed until 1871 when free school provision was included in the &quot;Comprehensive School Act&quot; of 1871.

=== &quot;Common School Act&quot; of 1850 ===
The &quot;Common School Act&quot; updated 1847 legislation creating school boards across Canada West. It required that municipalities meet the funding needs stated by their local school board and allows for schools to be paid for through provincial and municipal funds alone, allowing individual boards to eliminate school fees but not making this compulsory. The Act also allowed for the creation of separate schools leading to provincially funded Catholic schools and to racially segregated schools. Although the act was passed during Ryerson&#x27;s time as superintendent, he was an opponent of segregation in schools at times. Ryerson said that enshrining the racist tendencies of Upper Canadians into law would be &quot;a disgrace to our Legislature&quot;, and attempted to force school boards establishing segregated schools to admit Black students, encouraging their families to mount lawsuits when they wouldn&#x27;t. 

=== The &quot;School Act&quot; of 1871 ===
The &quot;School Act&quot; made elementary education compulsory and free up to age 12. The Act also created two streams of secondary education: high schools, the lower stream, and collegiate institutes, the higher stream. Extra funding was provided for collegiate institutes &quot;with a daily average attendance of sixty boys studying Latin and Greek under a minimum of four masters.&quot;

== Ryerson and residential schools ==
In 1847, Ryerson was asked by George Vardon, the British Assistant Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for his ideas as to &quot;the best method of establishing and conducting Industrial Schools for the benefit of the Aboriginal Indian Tribes.&quot; This was following the 1844 Bagot Report and the 1846 Conference of the Narrows, a conference to update indigenous communities on the establishment of manual labour day schools after Methodist and Ojibwe petitioning. The Methodists were given responsibility over the schools.

Vardon was anxious about the project&#x27;s prospect. Ryerson replied with a five-page handwritten letter, later printed in 1898 as an appendix to a report on residential schools by the Indian Affairs Department. Ryerson rejected the term &quot;manual labour schools,&quot; and his recommendations include academic studies not needed for mere &quot;manual labour.&quot; Ryerson foresaw a system that would assimilate indigenous youth into Canadian and Christian society. He said that &quot;It would be a gratifying result to see graduates of our Indian industrial schools become overseers of some the largest farms in Canada, nor will it be less gratifying to see them industrious and prosperous farmers on their own account.&quot; The academic subjects recommended were: reading, principles of the English language, arithmetic, elementary geometry, geography, history, natural history, agricultural chemistry, writing, drawing, vocal music, book keeping (especially farmers accounts), religion and morals. The schools were to be residential, involving eight to 12 hours a day of labour and two hours of instruction. The industrial schools should keep children from four to twelve years, be conducted in English, provide instruction in Christian religion and be run by Christian churches without government oversight. 

The term “residential school” does not appear in any of the major scholarly works on Ryerson: the two-volume &quot;Life and Letters&quot; by Sissons, or the three regular biographies (Burwash, Thomas and Damania) nor in Ryerson’s own &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, edited by J. George Hodgins.  Books such as Chaiton and N. McDonald’s &quot;Ryerson and His Times&quot; (1978) again do not mention the words, nor does a thesis on Ryerson’s political views (Pearce, 1986). Sources of Ryerson’s work in education, similarly, include no mention of residential schools (Putnam, 1912; Harris and Tremblay, 1960), nor the entry in the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot; (Gidney). 

His recommendations were adopted by the Indian Affairs Department. By 1850, there were two major residential schools in Canada West: Alnwick, to serve northern and south-eastern bands in Alderville, and Mount Elgin, to serve south-western bands. Mount Elgin was to have been led by Peter Jones of the Mississaugas, but he was too ill to take up the task. The curriculum largely followed Ryerson&#x27;s outline, which was itself in agreement with Methodists&#x27; plans to educate the indigenous. The daily schedule at Mount Elgin followed Ryerson&#x27;s outline:

* 5:00 am - bell rings, students rise, wash and dress
* 5:30 am - Breakfast, then prayers
* 6-9 am - Boys work on farm and girls work in house
* 9-12 am - School
* 12-1 pm - Lunch and recreation
* 1-3:30 pm - School
* 3:30 pm - Work on farm
* 6 pm - Dinner and prayers
* Evening - In winter, boys in school, girls learn needlework
* 9 pm - Bedtime
Source: MacLean 2005; table reproduced from p. 115

According to MacLean, the purpose of the schools was &quot;to eradicate Ojibwa Culture. Instruction in Christianity was considered a primary means of effecting change and consisted not only of daily prayers and attendance at church, but also the memorization of long passages of Scripture.&quot; The residential school system would later expand as Canada expanded into the west. The Crown, and later Canada, accepted the provision of education in exchange for settlement lands under treaty. The consequences of the system, which ran for over a century, are well-known and formal apologies would later be made by the Government of Canada and the Pope of Rome.

Ryerson was not directly involved in the setup or running of the residential school system, involved as he was in the Common Schools of Canada West and Ontario and the Normal School. And Ryerson predeceased much of its development. Any further communications by Ryerson on the subject of indigenous instruction and its schools is not known. Secondary literature on Ryerson focuses on his role in the development of the Ontario public school system. This includes a two-volume &quot;Life and Letters&quot; (Sissons, 1937, 1947), and three biographies (Burwash, 1905; Thomas, 1969; and Damania, 1975). He had a direct role in the Ontario public education system, as described in several scholarly works on the subject.(Putman, 1912; Curtis, 1989 and 1992; Pearce, 2020);

There are opposing views on the accusations against Ryerson and the decision to rename Ryerson University, and other places named after him (Smith, 2017 and 2021; Stagg and Dutil, 2021; Stagg, 2022; McDonald, 2021 and 2023).

On 8 June 2021, the town of Owen Sound, Ontario removed the name plaque of Ryerson Park. The park, named for Egerton Ryerson, will be renamed at the request of 1,000 residents of Owen Sound. The town pre-emptively removed the plaque to prevent its defacement and damage. A school named for Ryerson in Owen Sound was closed in 1990.

== Ryerson statue ==
A bronze statue of Ryerson was commissioned after his death in 1882, paid for by public subscription. The artist was Hamilton MacCarthy a noted artist of bronze monumental statues. It was placed on the grounds of the Education Department, site of the old Normal School founded by Ryerson and the first teacher training college in Canada.  It was unveiled by the lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell, on the Queen&#x27;s birthday, 24 May 1889. The chancellors of four universities attended (Queen’s, Trinity, McMaster and Victoria), the mayor of Toronto and other officials. There was a scripture reading and a hymn, &quot;All People that on Earth do dwell.&quot;

In 1950, it was proposed to move the statue to Queen&#x27;s Park by Keith Balfour, a Toronto mining company executive. The proposed move was opposed by the students of Ryerson Institute of Technology. The statue was cleaned annually by new students with toothbrushes as an initiation exercise.

On 18 July 2020, three people were arrested for splattering pink paint on the statue – in addition to two others of John A. Macdonald and King Edward VII at the Ontario Legislature – as part of a demand to tear down the monuments. Black Lives Matter Toronto claimed responsibility for the actions stating that &quot;The action comes after the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario have failed to take action against police violence against Black people.&quot; Three people were each charged with three counts of mischief under $5,000 and conspiracy to commit a summary offence; the charges were dropped the following year.

On 1 June 2021, following the discovery of soil disturbances at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, widely reported by the media as sites of 215 unmarked graves, the statue was vandalized again, this time with red paint. On 6 June, the statue was toppled, decapitated and thrown into Toronto Harbour; Ryerson University stated that the statue will not be restored or replaced. The head of the statue was subsequently placed on a pike at the Six Nations of the Grand River near Caledonia, Ontario.

After the events around the statue, on 8 June 2021, the town of Owen Sound, Ontario removed the name plaque of Ryerson Park. The park, named for Egerton Ryerson, will be renamed at the request of 1,000 residents of Owen Sound. The town pre-emptively removed the plaque to prevent its defacement and damage. A school named for Ryerson in Owen Sound was closed in 1990.

On 26 April 2022, Ryerson University announced its renaming to Toronto Metropolitan University. The statue&#x27;s location has since been cleared and cleaned.

==Personal life==

Ryerson was married twice and had several children. In 1828, he married Hannah Aikman. She died in 1832, soon after the birth of their second child. Their children were John and Lucilla Hannah. John died of dysentery in 1835 at age six, and Lucilla died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1849 at age 17.

In 1833, Ryerson married Mary Armstrong in York (Toronto). Together they had two children, Sophia in 1836 and Charles Egerton in 1847:
* Charles Egerton Ryerson (1847–1909) – secretary-treasurer and assistant librarian of Toronto; his children with Emily Eliza Beatty (1848–1947) were:
** Egerton Ryerson (1876–?), a missionary priest in Japan
** Edward Stanley Ryerson (1879–1963)
*** Stanley Bréhaut Ryerson (1911–1998), historian and Communist politician
** Mary Ella Ryerson (1882–1983)
** Isabel Louise Ryerson (1884–1954)
** John Egerton Ryerson (1887–1916)
*Sophia Ryerson Harris (1836–1898)

Ryerson retired in 1876. His book &quot;The Loyalists of America and Their Times&quot; on the United Empire Loyalists was published in 1881. He died on 19 February 1882 after an extended illness. Schools were closed and flags were lowered to half-staff in his honour. His funeral at the Metropolitan Wesleyan Methodist Church was attended by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario John Beverley Robinson, members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, officials of the Methodist Church and officials of Victoria College. He was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

Ryerson lived nearby to the Normal School, at 171 Victoria Street just north of today&#x27;s Dundas Street. After his death, the building was used by his son&#x27;s family and eventually sold. In 1923, the building was extensively modified to allow the connection of Dundas Street in front and also for commercial use. It is not known if any of the original residence survives.

<text>Morris Seligman Dees Jr. (born December 16, 1936) is an American attorney known as the co-founder and former chief trial counsel for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), based in Montgomery, Alabama. He ran a direct marketing firm before founding SPLC. Along with his law partner, Joseph J. Levin Jr., Dees founded the SPLC in 1971. Dees and his colleagues at the SPLC have been &quot;credited with devising innovative ways to cripple hate groups&quot; such as the Ku Klux Klan, particularly by using &quot;damage litigation&quot;.

On 14 March 2019 the SPLC announced that Dees had been fired from the organization and the SPLC would hire an &quot;outside organization&quot; to assess the SPLC&#x27;s workplace climate. Former employees alleged that Dees was &quot;complicit&quot; in harassment and racial discrimination, and said that at least one female employee had accused him of sexual harassment.

==Early life==
Dees was born in 1936 in Shorter, Alabama, the son of Annie Ruth (Frazer) and Morris Seligman Dees Sr., tenant cotton farmers. His family was Baptist. His grandfather named his son &quot;Morris Seligman&quot; after a Jewish friend. After graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1960, Dees returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a law office.

==Marketing career==
Dees ran a direct mail and direct marketing business, Fuller &amp; Dees Marketing Group, with Millard Fuller. He bought Fuller out in 1964 for $1 million, much of which Fuller donated to charity. After what Dees described in his autobiography as &quot;a night of soul searching at a snowed-in Cincinnati airport&quot; in 1967, he sold the company in 1969 to Times Mirror, the parent company of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. While major civil rights legislation had been passed, Dees knew there were many injustices and organizations that continued to oppose minority rights. He used the revenue from the sale to found a legal firm (that eventually became the Southern Poverty Law Center) in 1971.
Dees&#x27;s former marketing firm partner Millard Fuller founded Habitat for Humanity International in 1976 and served there in executive roles until 2005.

==Political campaigns==
Dees was active as financial director of George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1972. He was national finance director for Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1976, and he was finance chairman for Edward Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1980.

==Civil rights legal practice==
In his 1991 autobiography Dees wrote that in 1962, as a young lawyer, he had represented Ku Klux Klan member Claude Henley, who faced federal charges for attacking Freedom Riders in an incident documented by a &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer. When Dees learned that another lawyer had asked for $15,000 to represent Henley, Dees offered to do the job for $5,000, which was roughly the median household annual salary in America at the time. Dees&#x27;s defense helped Henley gain an acquittal. Dees later said he had an &quot;epiphany&quot; and regretted defending Henley.

In 1969, Dees sued the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) in Montgomery, Alabama, at the request of African-American civil rights activist Mary Louise Smith. She said that her son Vincent and nephew Edward had been refused admission to attend a YMCA summer camp. The YMCA was a private organization and therefore not bound by the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial discrimination in public facilities.

But Dees discovered that, in order to avoid desegregating its recreational facilities, the city of Montgomery had signed a secret agreement with the YMCA to operate them as private facilities and on the city&#x27;s behalf. He introduced evidence of this agreement in court and challenged the constitutionality of the YMCA&#x27;s position. The trial court ruled that the YMCA effectively had a &quot;municipal charter&quot; by this agreement with the city, and was therefore bound by the Fourteenth Amendment (and the Civil Rights Act) to desegregate its facilities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit partly affirmed the trial judge&#x27;s finding, reversing his order that the YMCA use affirmative action to racially integrate its board of directors. According to historian Timothy Minchin, Dees was &quot;emboldened by this victory&quot; when he founded the SPLC in 1971.

==Civil lawsuit strategy==
Dees was one of the principal architects of a strategy that used civil lawsuits to secure a court judgment for monetary damages against an organization for a wrongful act. The courts could potentially seize organization assets in order to gain payment of the judgment. Dees said that the aim was to gain large judgements which would &quot;clean their clock&quot;.

In 1981, the SPLC and Dees sued the United Klans of America (UKA) along with Michael Figures as co-counsel and won a $7 million judgment for Beulah Mae Donald, the mother of Michael Donald, an African American who had been lynched by UKA members in Alabama. The judgment bankrupted UKA and its national headquarters building was sold for $51,875.

A decade later, in 1991, Dees obtained a judgment of $12 million against Tom and John Metzger and the White Aryan Resistance. He also helped secure a $6.5 million judgment in 2001 against the Aryan Nations. Dees&#x27;s most famous cases have involved landmark damage awards that have driven several prominent neo-Nazi groups into bankruptcy, effectively causing them to disband.

==Criticism==
Dees&#x27;s critics have included the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot;, which has portrayed his work with the SPLC as self-promotional, contending that Dees exaggerates the threat of hate groups. In 1994, the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; ran a series alleging that Dees discriminated against the SPLC&#x27;s black employees, some of whom &quot;felt threatened and banded together&quot;.

A 2000 article by Ken Silverstein in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; alleged that Dees kept the SPLC focused on fighting anti-minority groups such as the KKK, instead of focusing on issues like homelessness, mostly because of the greater fundraising potential of the former. The article also claimed that the SPLC &quot;spends twice as much on fund-raising – $5.76 million last year – as it does on legal services for victims of civil rights abuses&quot;. Stephen Bright, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney and former president of the Southern Center for Human Rights, wrote in 2007 that Dees was &quot;a con man and fraud&quot;, who &quot;has taken advantage of naive, well-meaning people – some of moderate or low incomes – who believe his pitches and give to his $175-million operation&quot;.

These comments were made after a controversy pitting Dees against much of the civil rights community in his support of the nomination of Edward E. Carnes to be a federal appeals court judge. Carnes was a well-known proponent of the death penalty, which has been shown to be disproportionately applied as a sentence against African-American men.

=== Firing from the SPLC and harassment allegations ===
In 2019, the SPLC fired Dees for undisclosed reasons, and said the firm would hire an &quot;outside organization&quot; to investigate its workplace practices. Before the firing, two dozen employees had complained to management about concerns of &quot;mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and racism&quot; which threatened SPLC&#x27;s moral authority and integrity. A former employee said that Dees had a &quot;reputation for hitting on young women&quot; and that his ouster came &quot;amid a staff revolt over the mistreatment of non-white and female employees&quot; by Dees and SPLC leadership.

==Target of assassination==
Dees&#x27;s legal actions against racial nationalist organizations have motivated many of them to target him for assassination. As a result, he has received numerous death threats from some of these groups. In 2007, Dees said that more than 30 people had been jailed in connection with plots to either kill him or blow up the center, although a Montgomery police spokesman said he was not aware that the SPLC had informed the police of threats. The &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; reported that a letter which described such a plot was sent by Hal Turner, a radio talk show host, a paid FBI informant and a white supremacist, on July 29, 2007, after the SPLC filed a lawsuit against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA) in Meade County, Kentucky. During the IKA trial, a former member of the IKA said that the Klan head told him to kill Dees. Dees and William F. McMurry represented the plaintiff in the trial against the IKA in November 2008.

==Political career==
In 1958, Dees started his political career by working for the Southern politician George Wallace, later the governor of Alabama. Indicating his change of direction, in 1972 he served as Senator George McGovern&#x27;s national finance director, in 1976 as President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s national finance director, and in 1980 as national finance chairman for Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s Democratic primary presidential campaign against Carter.

In 2004 Dees ran for the board of the Sierra Club as a protest candidate, qualifying by petition.

==Awards and recognition==
* In 1993 he received the Salem Award for Human Rights and Social Justice.
* In 1990, Dees was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from Whittier College.
* In 2006, the law firm of Skadden Arps partnered with the University of Alabama School of Law to create the Morris Dees Justice Award in honor of Dees, an Alabama graduate. The award is given annually to a lawyer who has &quot;devoted his or her career to serving the public interest and pursuing justice, and whose work has brought positive change in the community, state or nation&quot;.
* The American Bar Association awarded Dees the ABA Medal, the association&#x27;s highest honor, by the ABA House of Delegates in 2012.
* In addition, on March 4, 2016, Dees received the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize, the highest award given by the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change. The award recognizes Dees&#x27; achievements in fighting racism and his commitment to nonviolence.

In the early 21st century, Dees has presented numerous lectures on civil rights and justice at universities. In 2009, he was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremony for San Francisco State University. He was identified as a Freedom Hero by The My Hero Project.

==Representation in other media==
The TV movie titled &quot;Line of Fire: The Morris Dees Story&quot; (1991) dramatized his campaigns against white supremacist hate groups.

Dees&#x27;s work was featured on the National Geographic&#x27;s &quot;Inside American Terror&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="474299" wikidata="Q17141479" url="?curid=474299" title="Moral hierarchy">
<text>A moral hierarchy is a hierarchy by which actions are ranked by their morality, with respect to a moral code. 

It also refers to a relationship – such as teacher/pupil or guru/disciple – in which one party is taken to have greater moral awareness than the other; or to the beneficial hierarchy of parent/child or doctor/patient.

==Kohlberg==

Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development have been read as creating a hierarchy of increasing moral complexity, ranging from the premoral at the bottom, through the midrange of conventionalism, up to the apex of self-selected morality.

In similar fashion, Robin Skynner viewed moral ideas (such as the &#x27;myths&#x27; of Charis Katakis) as being interpretable at different levels, depending on the degree of mental health attained; while Eric Berne saw the three ego states of Parent/Adult/Child as falling naturally into a moral hierarchy universally respected in both time and place.

==Dante==

Dante&#x27;s universe was structured in a hierarchy of moral sins and moral virtues, the stratified circles of Hell reaching down for example from the self-indulgent sins at the higher levels, to those of violence below, and the fraudulent at the bottom.

==Confucianism==

The Confucian concept of a moral hierarchy traditionally served as a check on arbitrary power in China.

Arguably at least, the concept of a moral hierarchy still influences China&#x27;s view of its place in the world today.

==Criticism==

Critics charge that the notion of a moral hierarchy is untenable in cases spanning multiple cultures, because moral codes are not equal but different, and therefore there is no way of showing that certain codes are superior to others.

Proponents of Kohlberg argue against such a relativistic view of morality, however, by pointing to cross-cultural evidence from more than 30 societies supporting the concept of a hierarchy of levels of moral complexity.

<text>A prosthetic group is the non-amino acid component that is part of the structure of the heteroproteins or conjugated proteins, being tightly linked to the apoprotein.

Not to be confused with the cosubstrate that binds to the enzyme apoenzyme (either a holoprotein or heteroprotein) by non-covalent binding a non-protein (non-amino acid) 

This is a component of a conjugated protein that is required for the protein&#x27;s biological activity. The prosthetic group may be organic (such as a vitamin, sugar, RNA, phosphate or lipid) or inorganic (such as a metal ion). Prosthetic groups are bound tightly to proteins and may even be attached through a covalent bond. They often play an important role in enzyme catalysis. A protein without its prosthetic group is called an apoprotein, while a protein combined with its prosthetic group is called a holoprotein. A non-covalently bound prosthetic group cannot generally be removed from the holoprotein without denaturating the protein. Thus, the term &quot;prosthetic group&quot; is a very general one and its main emphasis is on the tight character of its binding to the apoprotein. It defines a &quot;structural&quot; property, in contrast to the term &quot;coenzyme&quot; that defines a &quot;functional&quot; property.

Prosthetic groups are a subset of cofactors. Loosely bound metal ions and coenzymes are still cofactors, but are generally not called prosthetic groups. In enzymes, prosthetic groups are involved in the catalytic mechanism and required for activity. Other prosthetic groups have structural properties. This is the case for the sugar and lipid moieties in glycoproteins and lipoproteins or RNA in ribosomes. They can be very large, representing the major part of the protein in proteoglycans for instance.

The heme group in hemoglobin is a prosthetic group. Further examples of organic prosthetic groups are vitamin derivatives: thiamine pyrophosphate, pyridoxal-phosphate and biotin. Since prosthetic groups are often vitamins or made from vitamins, this is one of the reasons why vitamins are required in the human diet. Inorganic prosthetic groups are usually transition metal ions such as iron (in heme groups, for example in cytochrome c oxidase and hemoglobin), zinc (for example in carbonic anhydrase), copper (for example in complex IV of the respiratory chain) and molybdenum (for example in nitrate reductase).

<doc id="474315" wikidata="Q837060" url="?curid=474315" title="Facility management">
<text>Facility management or facilities management (FM) is a professional discipline focused on coordinating the use of space, infrastructure, people, and organization. Facilities management ensures that physical assets and environments are managed effectively to meet the needs of their users. By integrating maintenance, safety, efficiency, and comfort, FM supports organizational goals within the built environment. The profession operates under global standards such as ISO 41001 and is guided by organizations like the International Facility Management Association (IFMA).

==History==
The concept of facilities management originated in the 1960s, primarily in the context of IT systems management. The term was coined by IBM alumnus and Electronic Data Systems founder Ross Perot, to describe the integration of network management and support services. Over time, it expanded to include broader elements of building and operational management.

Facility management as integral to the processes of strategic organizational planning was represented during a 1979 conference sponsored by Herman Miller. Following the meeting, the furniture manufacturer opened the Facility Management Institute (FMI), with its headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The National Facility Management Association (NFMA) was formed in 1980, separating the overall profession from a single enterprise. In 1982, the NFMA expanded to form the International Facility Management Association (IFMA)

In 1986, the first professional FM organization was launched in the UK, as the Association of Facility Managers (AFM).

==Definitions and scope==
Facility management encompasses interdisciplinary business functions to balance the demand and supply of facilities and services. The term “facility” includes all tangible assets supporting an organization, such as real estate, buildings, infrastructure, HVAC systems, IT services, and more. 

In 2017, ISO 41011 defined FM as the &quot;organizational function which integrates people, place and process within the built environment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of people and the productivity of the core business.&quot; The ISO definition was formally adopted by BIFM in August 2017. ISO 41001:2018 provided a management framework to implement these principles. 

===Scope===
Facilities management is divided into two major categories:

#Hard FM, referring to the management of physical infrastructure, including HVAC, plumbing, lighting, and maintenance.
#Soft FM, referring to services supporting occupants including cleaning, catering, security, and event setups.

===Key Competencies===
According to the IFMA: &quot;FM is the practice of coordinating the physical workplace with the people and work of the organization. It integrates the principles of business administration, architecture, and the behavioral and engineering sciences.&quot; In a 2017 global job task analysis, IFMA identified eleven competencies of facility management as:
* leadership and strategy
* operations and maintenance
* finance and business
* environmental stewardship and sustainability
* project management
* Human factors and ergonomics
* real estate and property management
* facility and technology management
* risk management
* communication
* quality and performance

The Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management, formerly the British Institute of Facilities Management, adopted the European definition and through its accredited qualification framework offers career path curriculum ranging from school leaver level through to master&#x27;s degree level that is aligned with the European Qualifications framework.

FM may also cover activities other than business services: these are referred to as non-core functions and vary from one business sector to another. FM is also subject to continuous innovation and development, under pressure to reduce costs and to add value to the core business of public or private sector client organizations.

===Accredited academics===
Facility management is supported with education, training, and professional qualifications often coordinated by FM institutes, universities, and associations. Degree programs exist at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels. Facility Management has been a recognised academic discipline since the 1990s. Initial FM research work in Europe started in universities in the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, where academies funded research centers and began to establish courses at Bachelors, Masters, and PhD levels.

Early European FM research centers include the Centre for Facilities Management (CFM), founded in Glasgow in 1990; the Centre for People and Buildings at Delft University of Technology; and Metamorphose at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The University of Moratuwa Faculty of Architecture in Sri Lanka has offered a BSc. degree in Facilities Management since 2006.

In 2018, 50 universities and research institutions were represented in EUROFM. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA) has certified 16 FM study programs and courses at universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany.

As of 2021, IFMA accredits university degree programs in the United States, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, Sweden, Hong Kong, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

== Role of the facilities manager ==
Facilities managers (FMs) operate across business functions. The main priority of an FM is keeping people alive and safe. Facility managers need to operate at two levels:
* Strategically and tactically: helping clients, customers and end-users understand the potential impact of their decisions on the provision of space, services, cost, and business risk.
* Operationally: ensuring a corporate and cost-effective environment for the occupants to function.

=== EHS: environment, health and safety ===
The FM department in an organization is required to identify, analyze, evaluate, control, and manage many environment and safety-related issues. Failure to do so may lead to unhealthy conditions leading to employees falling sick, injury, loss of business, prosecution, and insurance claims. The confidence of customers and investors in the business may also be affected by adverse publicity from safety lapses.

=== Fire safety ===
The threat from fire carries one of the highest risks to loss of life, and the potential to damage property or shut down a business. The facilities management department will have in place maintenance, inspection, and testing for all of the facility&#x27;s fire safety equipment and life safety systems, keeping records and certificates of compliance.

=== Security ===
Protection of employees and the business often comes under the control of the facilities management department, particularly the maintenance of security hardware. Staffed guarding may be under the control of a separate department.

=== Maintenance, testing and inspections ===
Maintenance, testing, and inspection schedules are required to ensure that the facility is operating safely and efficiently in compliance with statutory obligations, to maximize the life of equipment, and to reduce the risk of failure. The work is planned, often using a computer-aided facility management (CAFM) system. Building maintenance includes all preventative, remedial, and upgrades works required for the upkeep and improvement of buildings and their components. These works may include disciplines such as painting and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, glazing, plastering, and tiling.

Buildings may be designed with a view to minimizing their maintenance requirement.

=== Cleaning ===
Cleaning operations are often undertaken out of business hours, but provision may be made during times of occupations for the cleaning of toilets, replenishing consumables (such as toilet rolls, soap) plus litter picking and reactive response is scheduled as a series of periodic (daily, weekly and monthly) tasks.

=== Operational ===
The facilities management department has responsibilities for the day-to-day running of the building; these tasks may be outsourced or carried out by directly employed staff. This is a policy issue, but due to the immediacy of the response required in many of the activities involved the facilities manager will often require daily reports or an escalation procedure.

Some issues require more than just periodic maintenance, for example, those that can stop or hamper the productivity of the business or that have safety implications. Many of these are managed by the facilities management &quot;help desk&quot; that staff is able to be contacted either by telephone or email. The response to help desk calls is prioritized but may be as simple as too hot or too cold, lights not working, photocopier jammed, coffee spills, or vending machine problems.

Help desks may be used to book meeting rooms, car parking spaces, and many other services, but this often depends on how the facilities department is organized. Facilities may be split into two sections, often referred to as &quot;soft&quot; services such as reception and post room, and &quot;hard&quot; services, such as the mechanical, fire, and electrical services. Due to climate change, FM providers are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance compliance considerations.

=== Business continuity planning ===
All organizations should have a continuity plan so that in the event of a fire or major failure the business can recover quickly. In large organizations, it may be that the staff move to another site that has been set up to model the existing operation. The facilities management department would be one of the key players should it be necessary to move the business to a recovery site.

=== Space allocation and changes ===
In many organizations, office layouts are subject to frequent changes. This process is referred to as churn, and the percentage of the staff moved during a year is known as the &quot;churn rate&quot;. These moves are normally planned by the facilities management department using a computer-aided design (CAD) system. In addition to meeting the needs of the business, compliance with statutory requirements related to office layouts include:
* The minimum amount of space to be provided per staff member
* fire safety arrangements
* lighting levels
* signage
* ventilation
* temperature control
* welfare arrangements such as toilets and drinking water
Consideration may also be given to vending, catering, or a place where staff can make a drink and take a break from their desk.

==World Facilities Management Day==
Since 2009, Global FM has sponsored a &quot;World FM Day&quot;. to celebrate and recognize the contributions of facilities management professionals. The event highlights the role of the facilities manager in driving sustainability, innovation, and operational excellence worldwide.

<text>The Red Green Show is a half-hour Canadian television comedy series. It aired on various channels in Canada from April 4, 1991 until April 7, 2006. The show was created and entirely co-written by Canadian comedian Steve Smith. Smith also played the title role of Red Green, a middle-aged handyman who runs a men&#x27;s club in the fictional Ontario town of Possum Lake. Most segments feature sketch comedy where Red and the other characters directly relate a comedic story to a live studio audience, interspersed with comedic segments featuring Red and a variety of secondary characters. Recurring themes of the comedy include Smith&#x27;s love of vintage cars and handyman projects, most of which involve duct tape.

During its fifteen seasons, it aired across six different networks but its longest run was with its final network, CBC Television. The show has also aired in the United States on PBS. The cast of the show also appeared in a feature-length film, &quot;Duct Tape Forever&quot;, released in 2003. Reruns air on CBC Television, CTV Comedy Channel, various Public Broadcasting Service stations, and on the Red Green Channel on Roku televisions. It was produced by S&amp;S Productions. Following the show&#x27;s finale in 2006, Smith has done stand-up comedy tours in character as Red Green.

==Premise==

Red Green (Steve Smith) is a middle-aged, married handyman and president of the &quot;Possum Lodge&quot;, a fictional men&#x27;s club in the small northwestern Ontario town of Possum Lake. Much of the show centres around Red and the other characters attempting to fix various problems in the area or carry out projects, but their plans almost always lead to comically disastrous results thanks to Red&#x27;s use of poorly thought-out shortcuts.

The show&#x27;s basic concept is that of a cable television show taped in front of a live audience at Possum Lodge with multiple segments recorded at other locations. The main story mostly occurs in the lodge in front of the audience, with the primary characters relating most of the episode&#x27;s events directly. The segments and interstitial cut-scenes provide lessons and demonstrations in repair work, outdoor activities, and advice for men. Red and other characters often break the fourth wall, directing glances and reactions at the audience and/or camera. Some skits regularly interact with the audience, including expected verbal responses from the crowd.

==Characters==

Recurring characters within the live portions of the show include Red&#x27;s nephew, Harold (Patrick McKenna); store owner Dalton Humphrey (Bob Bainborough); sewage worker Winston Rothschild III (Jeff Lumby); and criminal Mike Hamar (Wayne Robson). The show has a variety of secondary segments throughout, many of which have included a large number of rotating characters over the years.

===Red Green===
The title character of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, Red Green is the leader of Possum Lodge and a self-proclaimed handyman who is constantly extolling the virtues of duct tape (&quot;the handyman&#x27;s secret weapon&quot;). He and his wife Bernice have no children, and have been married for 25 years as of the series premiere. He is seldom seen wearing anything other than his distinctive outfit of a flannel shirt, khaki pants, suspenders (colored red and green as of Season 3), and a Canadian military field manoeuvres cap.

According to his DVD biography, Red became the leader of Possum Lodge after gradually becoming more involved with it over time and becoming &quot;the only guy nobody hated.&quot; At one point, he borrowed a large sum of money from his brother, who lost his job at a bank soon afterward. In repayment, Red employed his nephew Harold as the producer and director of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. In addition to being a handyman, Red also has several main philosophies in life, some of which are passed on to the lodge as a whole. Chief among them is the phrase &quot;Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati&quot; (pseudo-Latin for &quot;When all else fails, play dead&quot;). He also concludes each of his Handyman Corner segments with the phrase, &quot;If the women don&#x27;t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy.&quot; Red owns what is known as &quot;the Possum Van&quot;, a 1979–1993 Dodge Ram cargo van, painted to resemble an opossum.

===Harold Green===
Harold (Patrick McKenna) is Red&#x27;s nephew and the fictional producer and director of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. He is a nerd, having a significant overbite, thick glasses, and a number of verbal tics. Harold ostensibly controls the transitions between segments with a large homemade device. He is often appalled by Red and the other lodge members and he puts much effort into trying to change everyone&#x27;s behaviour, usually with little or no success. When McKenna left the show at the end of the eighth season, Harold was claimed by the show to have moved to the city; after McKenna was able to return, Harold became his company&#x27;s liaison to Possum Lake. At the end of the series, Harold dates and marries Bonnie (Laurie Elliott), who shares many of his mannerisms.

===Other characters===
* Ranger Gord (Peter Keleghan) - A forest ranger who has lived in his watch tower for 18 years. Gord is known for his eccentric and emotional behavior, resulting from his isolation.
* Dalton Humphrey (Bob Bainborough) - An excessively frugal store owner who is also shown to be heavily controlled by his wife.
* Mike Hamar (Wayne Robson) - A criminal who is on parole, and is known for his kleptomania.
* Edgar Montrose (Graham Greene) - An explosives enthusiast, often shown using dynamite in creative fashions.
* Winston Rothschild III (Jeff Lumby) - An enthusiastic sewage worker.
* Hap Shaugnessy (Gordon Pinsent) - A water taxi owner, known for telling exaggerated fabrications about his perceived involvement in various scenarios.

==Segments==
The show&#x27;s structure evolved over time and included several regular segments that appeared in almost every episode, interspersed with the main plot.

=== Repair and Handyman segments ===
* Handyman Corner – Red demonstrates creative and often humorous ways to tackle relatively common tasks, or he builds things out of other everyday items such as turning a car into an exercise workout station. The segment always ends with the popular tagline, &quot;If the women don&#x27;t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy&quot;.
* If It Ain&#x27;t Broke, You&#x27;re Not Trying! – Members of Possum Lodge bring in broken items for Red to fix, telling bizarre stories of how they became damaged.

=== Adventures with Bill ===
A black-and-white segment in the form of a silent home movie, accompanied by Red&#x27;s narration, background music, and sound effects. Bill Smith (Rick Green) attempts to accomplish a relatively straightforward task, try out a sport, or go on some adventure, frequently assisted by Red or Harold. However, the effort invariably degenerates into slapstick comedy as the characters fall victim to a series of outlandish mishaps. When Rick Green left the show from 1999 to 2003, characters from other portions of the show appeared in his place.

=== The Possum Lodge Word Game ===
A game which requires one contestant (usually Red) to get another one to say a certain word in 30 seconds by giving them various clues. However, the guesser consistently provides humorously mismatched answers based on their preoccupation with their own work or lifestyle. In nearly all games, the guesser eventually says the correct word by accident or a form of word play, typically winning a comedic prize described at the start of the segment.

=== North of Forty ===
Red gives out sage advice from behind his fly tying workbench, usually talking to older men about married life or coping with changing society. This segment always concludes with another famous Red Green phrase: &quot;Remember, I&#x27;m pulling for you. We&#x27;re all in this together.&quot;

=== Buddy System ===
Two characters (typically Red and one of his friends) give men advice on how to get out of trouble, usually with their wives.

=== Poetry, songs, biographies ===
During the first six seasons, Red often recited short bits of poetry in the woods. Some of these segments were named after a particular season and included Red&#x27;s commentary on it, while others were presented as original poems and often included a humorous twist on a well-known saying. During the first eight seasons, Red and Harold would perform a humorous song while sitting by a campfire, with Red singing and playing guitar, and Harold accompanying him on spoons or other instruments and occasionally singing as well. In the ninth and tenth seasons, Red would present a brief biographical sketch of a &quot;famous&quot; Possum Lake resident, with additional comments by other characters.

=== Male Call and The Experts ===
&quot;Male Call,&quot; featured in the first six seasons, involves Harold reading a letter supposedly sent by a viewer; Red provides an answer, frequently misinterpreting the viewer&#x27;s question. &quot;The Experts&quot; had a similar format and debuted in the third season, running until the end of the series; here, Red and one or more of his friends gave ridiculous advice in response to alleged viewer letters. The host of &quot;The Experts&quot; (usually Harold) introduced the segment by referring to &quot;those three little words men find so hard to say.&quot; The words in question were &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; at first said by the host and later shouted by the studio audience.

=== Character-specific segments ===
* Teen Talk: Red or Mike gives advice to teenage viewers about growing up. 
* Brief commercials for Winston Rothschild III&#x27;s Sewage and Septic Sucking Services.
* Ranger Gord&#x27;s Educational Films: Animated segments, ostensibly created by Ranger Gord himself, offering advice on wilderness safety to anthropomorphic animal versions of Red and Harold. These segments were animated by Bryce Hallett of Frog Feet Productions, with Keleghan providing the voices of all characters.

=== Conclusion and credits ===
Episodes typically end with Red giving a message to his wife Bernice, usually a double entendre, followed by his signature piece of life advice in the form of a hockey metaphor: &quot;Keep your stick on the ice.&quot; Beginning with the second season, the end of each episode also incorporates a meeting of the Possum Lodge members in the basement, opened by a sound effect of a squealing possum and a recitation of the Lodge motto: &quot;Quando omni flunkus moritati&quot;, mock Latin for &quot;When all else fails, play dead&quot;. This is frequently followed by a reading of general announcements and/or a recitation of the Man&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;I&#x27;m a man, but I can change, if I have to, I guess.&quot; During the second season, the meeting begins before the closing credits and continues under them; in all subsequent seasons, the meeting only runs under the credits.

The final episode of the series features an altered version of the prayer: &quot;I&#x27;m a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh, well.&quot; Steve Smith later identified that this was a tribute to his wife Morag, who had simply commented &quot;Oh, well&quot; upon viewing the first episode in 1991. In one episode, women hold a retreat at Possum Lodge and sit in on the meeting, changing the prayer to &quot;I am woman, hear me roar. I&#x27;m in charge. Get over it.&quot;

==History==

Smith originally created the character of Red Green for his 1979–1985 sketch comedy series &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;. The sketch was a parody of the long-running Canadian outdoors show &quot;The Red Fisher Show&quot; (1968–1989), starring B.H. &quot;Red&quot; Fisher, in which Red and his friends would show silent films of their fishing trips with commentary at &quot;Scuttlebutt Lodge&quot;. The character also appeared in &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot; before becoming the focus of his own series.

When &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; premiered on January 4, 1991, it was filmed at the studios of CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario for Seasons 1-2 (1991-1993), then on CFPL-TV in London for Season 3 (1993-1994), and then on the Global Television Network for Seasons 4-6 (1994-1997), and finally, on CBC Television for Seasons 7-15 (1997-2006). The show was renamed &quot;The New Red Green Show&quot; upon its move to Global, in order to distinguish it from reruns of earlier seasons, and reverted back to &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; starting in Season 8 (1998-1999).

The show ended on April 5, 2006, having aired 300 half-hour episodes over 15 seasons. Smith decided that the fifteenth season of the show would be the last. He told a reporter that when it came to his entertainment career &quot;I kind of sense when things are coming to an end and I get ahead of it.&quot; He wanted to avoid going &quot;one season too many&quot; otherwise &quot;It will at best be repetitive...&quot;

The series finale was filmed on November 5, 2005, at the Showline Studios Harbourside location. At the time when the season began taping, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation locked out staffers who were members of the Canadian Media Guild, rendering the show&#x27;s regular studios at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre unavailable. The last episode concluded with the show breaking the fourth wall by thanking the audience and fans for their popularity. In addition, the Man&#x27;s Prayer was revised to &quot;I&#x27;m a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh, well.&quot; Steve Smith later acknowledged that this was a tribute to his wife, who had simply responded with &quot;Oh well&quot; after watching the first episode air back in 1991.

The show staged several live mini-telethons (sometimes called &quot;&quot;Red Green&quot;-a-thons&quot;) for public television stations in the United States. These usually coincided with national PBS fundraising drives, and featured contests between various PBS stations carrying the show. The goal was to encourage stations to add the show to their schedules, or to continue airing it if they were already doing so; during one event, Red playfully filled a wheelbarrow with stations that had chosen to drop it from their schedules.

On December 14, 2008, a retrospective special titled &quot;The Red Green Story-We&#x27;re All in This Together&quot; aired on select PBS stations. The special was released on DVD along with a book. Also, despite stating after the show&#x27;s final episode that he planned to permanently retire his character, in 2010, Smith embarked on the &quot;Wit and Wisdom Comedy Tour&quot;, in which he gave live performances as Red Green in cities across the United States and Canada.

==&quot;How to Do Everything&quot;==
On November 29, 2012, Steve Smith announced a new &quot;How to Do Everything&quot; Tour, which began in Canada in late 2013 before going to the United States in spring 2014. The 2016 North American tour, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Old, I&#x27;m Ripe&quot;, began in March and concluded in May, with stops in 25 U.S. cities. The 2019 North American tour, &quot;This Could Be It&quot;, began in March 2019 and ran until the end of October, with shows in 34 U.S. cities and 29 Canadian cities. These tours feature Smith performing stand-up comedy in character as Red Green.

From September 1998 to August 7, 2017, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; aired on The Comedy Network. From 2002 to 2005, reruns aired on CBC, Thursdays at 12:30pm and Saturdays at 6:30pm Eastern. In the United States, digital multicast network Heartland added reruns of the show to its schedule in September 2018. There is also currently a Red Green Channel on Roku televisions, and all 300 episodes are available on YouTube.

==Episodes==
&quot;The Red Green Show&quot; aired for 15 seasons, and a total of 300 episodes.

==DVD releases==
Acorn Media has released portions of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in various incarnations.

In 2002–2003, they released six compilation DVDs labeled as &quot;Stuffed and Mounted&quot; volumes 1 through 6. Each DVD contains episodes from various seasons of the show up to season 10 (the most current season at the time these DVDs were released). However, there were no episodes from season two. These DVDs feature a spoken-word introduction by Steve Smith (out of character, as evidenced by his higher-pitched voice).

In 2006, Acorn began to release the series on DVD in complete season sets. Of note, the releases are identified by year, not season number; thus the 7th season is labeled as &quot;1997 Season&quot;, the 8th season is &quot;1998 Season&quot;, and so on. Seasons 7 through 11 were released in this format.

In 2010, Acorn changed formats again and began to release DVD sets that each contained three complete seasons. The first release, &quot;The Red Green Show: The Infantile Years&quot;, features all 72 episodes from the first 3 seasons in a 9-disc set. Extras include introductions by Steve Smith, and Red &amp; Harold character biographies. Seasons 4 through 6 were released in &quot;The Red Green Show: The Toddlin&#x27; Years&quot;. Seasons 7 through 9 were released in &quot;The Red Green Show: The Delinquent Years&quot;. Seasons 10 through 12 were released in &quot;The Red Green Show: The Midlife Crisis Years&quot;. On 20 September 2011, Acorn released &quot;The Red Green Show: The Geezer Years&quot;, which contains episodes from the final three seasons (13–15).

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Red Green Show&quot; was nominated for 23 Gemini Awards during its run. Its only win was in 1998, for Best Performance in a Comedy Program or Series, awarded jointly to Steve Smith and Patrick McKenna for the episode &quot;The Movie.&quot; In 2023, Smith was inducted into the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame in both the Creator and Performer categories.

<doc id="474321" wikidata="Q734955" url="?curid=474321" title="Robinson Jeffers">
<text>John Robinson Jeffers (January 10, 1887 – January 20, 1962) was an American poet known for his work about the central California coast. 

Much of Jeffers&#x27; poetry was written in narrative and epic form. However, he is also known for his shorter verse and is considered an icon of the environmental movement. 

Influential and highly regarded in some circles, despite or because of his philosophy of &quot;inhumanism&quot;, Jeffers believed that transcending conflict required human concerns to be de-emphasized in favor of the boundless whole. This led him to oppose U.S. participation in World War II, a stance that was controversial after the U.S. entered the war.

==Life==
Jeffers was born January 10, 1887, in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh), the son of Reverend Dr. William Hamilton Jeffers, a Presbyterian minister and scholar of ancient languages and Biblical history, and Annie Robinson Tuttle. His brother was Hamilton Jeffers, a well-known astronomer who worked at Lick Observatory. Jeffers traveled through Europe during his youth and attended school in Germany, France, and Switzerland. An outstanding student, he was instructed in the classics and Greek and Latin language and literature. By age twelve, he was fluent in German and French as well as English. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Occidental College at age 18. While attending college, he was an avid outdoorsman and active in the school&#x27;s literary societies.

After he graduated from Occidental, Jeffers went to the University of Southern California (USC) to study at first literature, and then medicine. He met Una Call Kuster in 1906; she was three years older than he, a graduate student, and the wife of a Los Angeles attorney, Edward G. (Ted) Kuster. Jeffers and Una Kuster became lovers; Ted Kuster discovered their affair in 1910. Jeffers dropped out of USC medical school and enrolled as a forestry student at the University of Washington in Seattle, a course of study that he abandoned after a semester, at which time he returned to Los Angeles. By 1912 the affair became a scandal, reaching the front page of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Una spent some time in Europe to quiet things down, then the lovers lived together by Lake Washington to await the completion of Una&#x27;s divorce. The two were married in 1913, then moved to La Jolla, California for six weeks, and finally Carmel, California in 1914, where Jeffers later constructed Tor House and Hawk Tower. The couple had a daughter who died a day after birth in 1913, and then twin sons, Donnan and Garth, in 1916. Una died of cancer in 1950. Jeffers died on January 20, 1962, 10 days after his 75th birthday; an obituary can be found in the &quot;New York Times&quot; from January 22, 1962.

=== Tor House===

In the 1920s and 1930s, at the height of his popularity, Jeffers was famous for being a tough outdoorsman, living in relative solitude and writing of the difficulty and beauty of the wild. He spent most of his life in Carmel, California, in a granite house that he built with his own hands which they named &quot;Tor House&quot;. &quot;Tor&quot; is a term for a craggy outcrop or lookout. Before Jeffers and Una purchased the land where Tor House would be built, they rented two cottages in Carmel, and enjoyed many afternoon walks and picnics at the &quot;tors&quot; near the site that would become Tor House.

To build the first part of Tor House, a small, two-story cottage, Jeffers hired a local builder, Michael J. Murphy. He worked with Murphy, and in this short, informal apprenticeship, he learned the art of stonemasonry. He continued adding on to Tor House throughout his life, writing in the mornings and working on the house in the afternoons. Many of his poems reflect the influence of stone and building on his life.

He later built a large four-story stone tower on the site called &quot;Hawk Tower&quot;. While he had not visited Ireland at this point in his life, it is possible that Hawk Tower is based on Francis Joseph Bigger&#x27;s &#x27;Castle Séan&#x27; at Ardglass, County Down, which had also in turn influenced William Butler Yeats&#x27; choice of a poet&#x27;s tower, Thoor Ballylee. Construction on Tor House continued into the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was completed by his eldest son. The completed residence was used as a family home until his descendants decided to turn it over to the Tor House Foundation, formed by Ansel Adams, for historic preservation. The romantic Gothic tower was named after a hawk that appeared while Jeffers was working on the structure, and which disappeared the day it was completed. The tower was a gift for his wife Una, who had a fascination for Irish literature and stone towers. In Una&#x27;s special room on the second floor were kept many of her favorite items, photographs of Jeffers taken by the artist Edward Weston, plants and dried flowers from Shelley&#x27;s grave, and a rosewood melodeon which she loved to play. The tower also included a secret interior staircase – a source of great fun for his young sons.

==Poetic career==
In the 1920s Jeffers began to publish long narrative poems, including &quot;Tamar&quot; and &quot;Roan Stallion.&quot; Often styled after the epic form of ancient Greeks, these poems were full of controversial subjects such as incest, murder, and parricide. Jeffers&#x27; short verse includes &quot;Hurt Hawks,&quot; &quot;The Purse-Seine&quot;, and &quot;Shine, Perishing Republic.&quot; His intense relationship with the physical world is described in often brutal and apocalyptic verse, which shows a preference for the natural world over what he sees as the deleterious influence of civilization. Jeffers did not accept the idea that meter is a fundamental part of poetry, and, like Marianne Moore, claimed that his verse was composed not in meter but in &quot;rolling stresses.&quot; He believed that meter was imposed on poetry by man and was not a fundamental part of poetry&#x27;s nature.

Many books followed Jeffers&#x27;s initial success with the epic form, including an adaptation of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;, which became a hit Broadway play starring Dame Judith Anderson.

George Sterling and Jeffers were good friends. Fellow poets Edgar Lee Masters and, longer, Benjamin De Casseres, were correspondents. Jeffers encountered D.H. Lawrence in Mabel Dodge Luhan&#x27;s circle at Taos; reports of how well they got along vary. In Carmel, Jeffers became the focal point for a small but devoted group of admirers. At the peak of his fame, he was one of the few poets to be featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was asked to read at the Library of Congress, and was posthumously put on a U.S. postage stamp.

Jeffers&#x27; 1948 collection, &quot;The Double Axe and Other Poems&quot; (1948), included several poems critical of American involvement in the Second World War and his publisher, Random House, suppressed some poems and included a note that Jeffers&#x27; views were not those of the publishing company. The book was negatively reviewed by several critics, including poets Yvor Winters and Kenneth Rexroth. By 1977 Jeffers&#x27; reservations seemed prescient and Liveright published &quot;The Double-Axe &amp; Other Poems including Eleven Suppressed Poems&quot;, with an important introduction by William Everson, Jeffers&#x27; major posthumous advocate and poetic adherent. Throughout the fifties and afterward Jeffers figured as an important voice for the worth and rights of the natural world, as the environmental movement gathered strength. His long-time friend, the photographer Ansel Adams, was a close ally in this, as was Edward Weston.

===Inhumanism===
Jeffers coined the word &quot;inhumanism&quot;: the belief that humankind is too self-centered and indifferent to the &quot;astonishing beauty of things.&quot; In the poem &quot;Carmel Point&quot; Jeffers called on humans to &quot;uncenter&quot; themselves. In &quot;The Double Axe&quot; Jeffers explicitly described &quot;inhumanism&quot; as &quot;a shifting of emphasis and significance from man to &#x27;notman&#x27;; the rejection of human solipsism, and recognition of the trans-human magnificence... This manner of thought and feeling is neither misanthropic nor pessimist... It offers a reasonable detachment as rule of conduct, instead of love, hate and envy... it provides magnificence for the religious instinct, and satisfies our need to admire greatness and rejoice in beauty.&quot;

In &quot;The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers&quot;, the first in-depth study of Jeffers not written by one of his circle, poet and critic J. Radcliffe Squires addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: &quot;Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe. He has told us that materialism has its message, its relevance, and its solace. These are different from the message, relevance, and solace of humanism. Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches us how to suffer.&quot;

==Influence==
His poems have been translated into many languages and published all over the world. Outside of the United States he is most popular in Japan and the Czech Republic. William Everson, Edward Abbey, Robert McDowell, Gary Snyder, and Mark Jarman are just a few recent authors who have been influenced by Jeffers. Charles Bukowski remarked that Jeffers was his favorite poet. Polish poet Czesław Miłosz also took an interest in Jeffers&#x27;s poetry and worked as a translator for several volumes of his poems. Jeffers also exchanged some letters with his Czech translator and popularizer, the poet Kamil Bednář. Writer Paul Mooney (1904–1939), son of American Indian authority James Mooney (1861–1921) and collaborator of travel writer Richard Halliburton (1900–1939), &quot;was known always to carry with him (a volume of Jeffers) as a chewer might carry a pouch of tobacco ... and, like Jeffers,&quot; writes Gerry Max in &quot;Horizon Chasers&quot;, &quot;worshipped nature ... (taking) refuge (from the encroachments of civilization) in a sort of chthonian mysticism rife with Greek dramatic elements ...&quot;

Jeffers was an inspiration and friend to western U.S. photographers of the early 20th century, including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Morley Baer. In fact, the elegant book of Baer&#x27;s photographs juxtaposed with Jeffers&#x27;s poetry, combines the creative talents of those two residents of the Big Sur coast.

Although Jeffers was largely marginalized in the mainstream academic community for decades, several important contemporary literary critics, including Albert Gelpi of Stanford University, and poet, critic and NEA chairman Dana Gioia, have consistently cited Jeffers as a formidable presence in modern literature.

Stanford University Press released a five volume compilation, &quot;The Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers&quot; (1988–2002). In an article titled &quot;A Black Sheep Joins the Fold,&quot; written upon the release of the collection in 2001, &quot;Stanford Magazine&quot; commented that it was remarkable that, due to a number of circumstances, &quot;there was never an authoritative, scholarly edition of California&#x27;s premier bard&quot; until this edition.

==Legacy==
His poem &quot;The Beaks of Eagles&quot; was included in the track &quot;California Saga&quot; on The Beach Boys album &quot;Holland&quot; (1973).

Two lines from Jeffers&#x27;s poem &quot;We Are Those People&quot; are quoted toward the end of the 2008 film &quot;Visioneers&quot;.

Several lines from Jeffers&#x27;s poem &quot;Wise Men in Their Bad Hours&quot; (&quot;Death&#x27;s a fierce meadowlark: but to die having made / Something more equal to the centuries / Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness.&quot;) appear in Christopher McCandless&#x27; diary.

Robinson Jeffers is mentioned in the 2004 film &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; by the character Albert Markovski played by Jason Schwartzman, when defending Jeffers as a nature writer against another character&#x27;s claim that environmentalism is socialism. Markovski says &quot;Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers, the National Geographic Society...all socialists?&quot;

A passage from Jeffers&#x27;s poem &quot;Ghost&quot; was read in the &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Tor House&quot;, where the &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; crew investigated Jeffers&#x27;s house to see if Jeffers&#x27;s spirit would appear 50 years later after his death as was said in his poem.

In &quot;A Secular Age&quot;, a critique of Western secularization, philosopher Charles Taylor presents Jeffers as an important literary example of &quot;immanent anti-humanism&quot; alongside figures such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Cormac McCarthy. Invoking (often at length) the poems &quot;At the Birth of an Age,&quot; &quot;Invasion,&quot; &quot;Rock and Hawk,&quot; &quot;Tamar,&quot; and &quot;The Women at Point Sur,&quot; Taylor sees Jeffers as encouraging human beings to embrace the beautiful cruelty of an indifferent universe.

Poet Adrienne Rich quotes Jeffers&#x27;s poem &quot;Prelude&quot; in her poem &quot;Yom Kippur 1984&quot;.

<doc id="474327" wikidata="Q253344" url="?curid=474327" title="Foundation's Fear">
<text>Foundation&#x27;s Fear (1997) is a science fiction novel by American writer Gregory Benford, set in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Foundation universe. It is the first book of the Second Foundation Trilogy, which was written after Asimov&#x27;s death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Magill Book Reviews&quot; noted that Benford avoided mimicking Asimov, adding &quot;large elements of action and political intrigue&quot; while remaining consistent with the intellectual foundation of the Asimov universe. &quot;Library Journal&quot; praised the author as a &quot;gifted storyteller&quot; who &quot;makes the characters come alive&quot;. 

== Plot summary ==
Emperor Cleon I wants to appoint Hari Seldon as the First Minister of the Galactic Empire. Powerful Trantor High Council member Betan Lamurk opposes the independent Seldon&#x27;s appointment. Seldon himself is reluctant to accept the position because of its time constraints pulling him away from the psychohistory project. The project is led by Seldon, Yugo Amaryl, and Seldon&#x27;s advanced humaniform robot-spouse Dors Venabili. Seldon needs to curry favor with the emperor, however, and advises Cleon I informally. For example, Seldon suggests a decree that erases terrorists&#x27; names from records, denying them immortality, discouraging chaotic actions.

Besides the psychohistorians, much of the novel&#x27;s action revolves around advanced sentient simulations (sims) of Joan of Arc and Voltaire. The sims have been recreated by Artifice Associates, a research company located in Trantor’s Dahl Sector. Artifice Associates programmers Marq and Sybil plan to use the Joan/ Voltaire sims for two money-making projects. First, Hari Seldon’s psychohistory project. Second, Trantor’s Junin-Sector “Preservers vs Skeptics Society” debate whether mechanical beings endowed with artificial intelligence should be built. And if so, whether they should receive full citizenship. The Preservers’ champion will be Joan, the Skeptics’ champion Voltaire.

Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili flee Trantor, escaping High Council member Betan Lamurk&#x27;s forces. During their galactic odyssey, Hari and Dors experience virtual reality as chimpanzees on planet Panucopia. They also visit helter-skelter New Renaissance world Sark.

Meanwhile, back on Trantor, sims Joan and Voltaire escape into Trantor&#x27;s Mesh (Internet). Joan and Voltaire interact with ancient aliens on the Mesh. These aliens fled Trantor&#x27;s physical space when terraforming robots arrived on Trantor more than 20,000 years ago. Via Joan and Voltaire, Hari allies with the mesh aliens. The aliens aid Seldon&#x27;s return to Trantor, and his defeat of High Council member Lamurk through tik-toks. The novel ends with Seldon accepting his position as Emperor Cleon&#x27;s First Minister.

<text>Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education, 175 U.S. 528 (1899), (&quot;Richmond&quot;) was a class action suit decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is a landmark case, in that it sanctioned &quot;de jure&quot; segregation of races in American schools. The decision was overruled by &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

==About the case==
The plaintiffs, &quot;Cumming, Harper and Ladeveze, citizens of Georgia and persons of color suing on behalf of themselves and all others in like case joining with them,&quot; originally filed suit by petition against the Board of Education of Richmond County (the &quot;Board&quot;) and one &quot;Charles S. Bohler, tax collector&quot; in the Superior Court of Richmond County, claiming, among other causes of action, that a $45,000 tax levied against the county for primary, intermediate, grammar, and high schools was illegal insofar as the high schools of the county were exclusively for white students and seeking an injunction barring the collection of so much of the total amount as was earmarked for the white only high school system.

County was reversed upon the ground that it erred in granting an injunction against the Board of Education. In accordance with that decision, the Superior Court upon the return of the cause from the Supreme Court of the State, refused the relief asked by the plaintiffs, and dismissed their petition. Thereafter, the plaintiffs appealed that order to the US Supreme Court as being in derogation of their rights under the US Constitution.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court affirmed on economic arguments, among others. It claimed that there were many more colored children than white children in the area and that the Board could not afford to supply everyone with education. The court reasoned that there was a choice between educating 60 white children and educating no one.

The Supreme Court denied that it had any jurisdiction to interfere in the decisions of the state courts. The decision states in pertinent part:
The final remark says:
Justice John Marshall Harlan, who was the lone dissenter in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.

<text>Parlez-moi (French for &quot;Talk to Me&quot;) is an educational television series which was produced in Toronto by TVOntario and broadcast from 1978 to 1980, with repeat broadcasts for several years afterwards. The host was Quebecois comedian Marc Favreau, who also appeared in this series under the guise of his trademark character, Sol the Clown.

==Format==

Each episode would begin with Favreau appearing as himself, speaking in English, and introducing several Quebec French words and phrases. This was followed by a fragment of a comedy sketch involving Sol, in which all of the dialogue was in French, using the terms introduced by Favreau. After the sketch, the terms would appear by themselves on the screen, while Favreau&#x27;s voice could be heard reciting them. The next portion of the sketch would then be presented in the same manner (typically three in total), and the episode would conclude by showing the entire Sol sketch, uninterrupted. Each episode used the same audio clip of Favreau announcing, &quot;and now, here is the complete sketch again.&quot;

The opening sequence of &quot;Parlez-moi&quot; uses an outtake of the sketch from Episode 2, combined with new footage in order to show Sol speaking to Favreau, the actor who plays him, on the phone.

==Episode list==

90 episodes were produced over two seasons.

<text>Marc Favreau, (November 9, 1929 – December 17, 2005) was a French Canadian humorist, film actor, and poet born in Montreal, Quebec. He is best known for developing and portraying the clown character Sol.

Favreau began his television career as a regular on &quot;La Boîte à surprise&quot;, a long-running children&#x27;s television show on Radio-Canada. At that time, he was teamed with another clown in an act called Bim et Sol. Favreau developed Sol&#x27;s monologues into an enormously popular one-man show. Favreau then teamed up with another clown for Sol et Bouton. Finally, Favreau created, with Luc Durand a popular television series called &quot;Sol et Gobelet&quot;.

Later, he played numerous roles on stage and on several television series on Canadian television, such as &quot;Parlez-moi&quot;, an instructional program on the French language on TVOntario in the late 1970s. Many English Canadian children got their first exposure to Quebec French through Favreau&#x27;s work. He is best remembered for the witty deconstructions of the French language which he invented for Sol.

In 1995, he was appointed Knight of the National Order of Quebec and an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2003. He was also a member of the Order of the Francophones of America, and was married to Quebec comedian-actress Micheline Gérin who died in 2007 at age 76.

Favreau died of cancer at Hôpital Notre-Dame in Montreal at 76 years old. A library bearing his name was built on the site of the former municipal workshops at 500 Boulevard Rosemont in Montreal in 2012. A school in the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce district also bears his name in homage.
