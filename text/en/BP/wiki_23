==Etymology and symbol==
Kotayk Province is named after the historic Kotayk canton of the historic Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenia, directly ruled by the royal Arsacid dynasty.

Kotayk was first mentioned as an Armenian region by Ptolemy as Kotakene. According to Movses Khorenatsi, the name Kotayk is derived from an ancient nearby settlement called Kutis.

The symbol of Kotayk is the &quot;lion of Geghard&quot; depicted on the coat of arms of the province, standing on a traditional Armenian sundial from Kecharis Monastery, surround by a bunch of Armenian grapes from both sides. The decorative statue of the lion of Geghard was erected in 1958 among the mountains of Kotayk, on the way to the 4th-century Geghard monastery. It is derived from the decorative lions carved on the walls of the monastery. The 1st-century pagan Temple of Garni is also depicted on the coat of arms of Kotayk.

==Geography==

Situated at the central part of modern-day Armenia, Kotayk covers an area of (7% of total area of Armenia). It is bordered by Gegharkunik Province from the east, Tavush Province from the northeast, Lori Province from the north, Aragatsotn Province from the west, Ararat Province from the south and the capital Yerevan from the southwest.

Historically, the current territory of the province mainly occupies parts of the &quot;Aragatsotn&quot;, &quot;Kotayk&quot;, &quot;Varazhnunik&quot; and &quot;Mazaz&quot; cantons of Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenia.

Kotayk occupies the northeastern part of the Ararat plain. The Kotayk plain located between Hrazdan and Azat rivers has a height of above sea level. It is dominated by the Gegham mountains from the northeast including the mountains of Azhdahak, Hatis and Gutanasar. The province approximates the Pambak mountains at the north, while the Tsaghkunyats mountains lie at the west, and the Voghjaberd mountains at the southwest of Kotayk.

Affected by the Gegham volcanoes, the land relief of Kotayk is covered with lava and tufa.

Hrazdan, Getar and Azat are the 3 major rivers of the province. Lake Akna located at a height of , is the only lake in the province.

The climate of the province is quite diversified. It ranges between arid and semi-arid climate at the south, and snowy climate at the centre and the north. Annual precipitation levels are less than at the dry areas, while it ranges between 400 and at the heights in the centre and the north of the province.

==History==

The earliest records about the region date back to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. According to Ptolemy, Kotayk was directly ruled by the Arsacid kings of Armenia. However, during the 4th and the 5th centuries, the territories were granted to the Varazhnuni noble family who governed the forests and lands used as a hunting ground by the kings of the Arsacid kings. Later between the 5th and 7th centuries, the region was granted to the Kamsarakan and Amatuni families, under the Persian rule. Between the 7th and 9th centuries, Armenia suffered from the Arab Islamic occupation.

By the end of the 9th century, the region became part of the newly established Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Between the 11th and 15th centuries, the region suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Ag Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, respectively.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the territory of modern-day Kotayk became part of the &quot;Erivan Beglarbegi&quot; within the Safavid Persia. During the first half of the 18th century, the territory became part of the Erivan Khanate under the rule of the Afsharid dynasty and later under the Qajar dynasty of Persia. It remained under the Persian rule until 1827–1828, when Eastern Armenia was ceded to the Russian Empire as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28 and the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay. With the fall of the Russian Empire and after the decisive Armenian victories over the Turks in the battles of Sardarabad, Abaran, and Gharakilisa, the region became part of the independent Armenia in May 1918.

After 2 years of brief independence, Armenia became part of the Soviet Union in December 1920. After the World War II, Kotayk witnessed major growth and development under the soviet rule. Many new urban settlements and industrial centres were established in the region, including the towns of Byureghavan (1945), Charentsavan (1947), Nor Hachn (1953), Hrazdan (1959) and Abovyan (1963). Thus Kotayk had gradually become a major industrial region within the Armenian SSR.

Between 1930 and 1995, modern-day Kotayk was divided into 3 raions: &quot;Kotayk raion&quot;, &quot;Nairi raion&quot;, and &quot;Hrazdan raion&quot;. With the territorial administration reform of 1995, the 3 raions were merged to form the Kotayk Province.

<text>Lori (, ), is a province(&quot;marz&quot;) of Armenia. It is located in the north of the country, bordering Georgia. Vanadzor is the capital and largest city of the province. Other important towns include Stepanavan, Alaverdi, and Spitak. It is home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Haghpat and Sanahin monasteries and the well-preserved Akhtala monastery.

The province was heavily damaged during the 1988 Armenian earthquake.

The province is served by the Stepanavan Airport.

==Etymology==

The name Lori (Լոռի) is of Armenian origin (from Armenian &quot;quail&quot;), first appeared in the 11th century when King David I Anhoghin founded the fortified city of Lori. The fortress-city became the capital of the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget in 1065. The name Lori later spread through the region and replaced the original name of Tashir.

==Geography==

Situated at the north of modern-day Armenia, Lori covers an area of (12.7% of total area of Armenia). It is bordered by Tavush Province from the east, Kotayk Province from the southeast, Aragatsotn Province from the southwest and Shirak Province from the west. The province is bordered by the Kvemo Kartli region of Georgia.

Historically, the territories of modern-day Lori are associated with the cantons of Tashir, Boghnopor and Dzorapor of Gugark province of Ancient Armenia.

Lori is a mountainous region, dominated by the ranges of Javakheti, Bazum, Pambak, Gugark, Halab and Somkheti. The highest point of the province is Mount Achkasar of the Javakheti range with a height of 3196 meters. The lowest point is 380 meters in the valley of Debed in the northeast of the province.

The main water resource of the province is the Debed river with its tributaries Dzoraget, Pambak and Martsaget.

The climate is characterized with extremely cold snowy winters and mild summers. The annual precipitation level is between .

==History==
Excavations conducted in 1931 testify that the region of modern-day Lori was most probably settled during the 1st half of the 2nd millennium BC. Later, the region became part of the Urartu Kingdom between the 8th and 6th centuries BC. After the Achaemenid invasion, the region became part of the 18th Satrapy of Persia. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia in 331 BC, the region became part of the kingdom within the historic Gugark province, the 13th province of Greater Armenia. In the course of the 4th century, the region was ruled by members of the House of Mihran.

Following the partition of Armenia in 387 between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia, and the subsequent collapse of Arsacid Armenia in 428, Eastern Armenia including Gugark province became under the rule of Sassanid Persia. In 658, Armenia was conquered by the Arab invaders. At the end of the 9th century, most of the Gugark province became part of the newly established Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. In 979, King Kiurike I founded the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget under the rule of the Kiurikian dynasty and the protectorate of the Bagratid kings of Armenia. The capital of the kingdom was Matsnaberd (until 1065) and the Lori fortress. The Kiurikians ruled the kingdom until 1118 when Tashir-Dzoraget became part of the Kingdom of Georgia.

The Seljuks invaded the region in the early 12th century, but their rule did not last long and in 1118–1122 the Georgian king David the Builder conquered Lori and granted the rule to the House of Orbeli. The Orbeli&#x27;s revolted unsuccessfully in 1177, after which a Kipchak named Kubasar was appointed &quot;spasalari&quot; of Lori. Later in 1185, the province became ruled by the Mkhargdzeli dynasty after Queen Tamar of Georgia appointed the Sargis Mkhargrdzeli as its governor. However, the region was devastated by the Mongol invasion of 1236, and the Zakarian dynasty declined by the 2nd half of the 14th century. After fall of the Kingdom of Georgia in 1490, Lori remained part of Kingdom of Kartli until the 16th century.

Lori was annexed by Safavid Persia as a result of the 1555 Peace of Amasya and became part of Persia&#x27;s Kartli-Kakheti province. After Nader Shah&#x27;s murder in 1747, the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti became independent and united into a single kingdom by 1762. 

In 1800–01, together with the Georgian provinces of Kartli and Kakheti, Lori and Tavush were annexed by the Russian Empire to become part of the Georgia Governorate. Lori became officially part of the Russian Empire at the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 1 January 1813, between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13.

In 1862, Lori was transferred into the jurisdiction of the Tiflis Governorate. In 1880, Lori became part of the Borchali uyezd of the Tiflis Governorate. In the early 20th century, Lori was mostly populated by Armenians, with several Russian and Greek villages. In May 1918, the Ottoman Turkish forces moved towards Yerevan and Karakilisa (now Vanadzor). On 25 May 1918, the Armenians led by Garegin Nzhdeh fought against the Turkish forces led by Wehib Pasha, at the vicinity of Karakilisa. On 28 May 1918, the Turks retreated from Karakalisa, Abaran and Sardarabad, paving way towards the declaration of the Republic of Armenia on the same day.

In late 1918, Armenia and Georgia fought a border war over Lori. Lori was claimed by both countries after 1918, when both declared its independence from Russian empire. Initially, Georgia controlled Lori. After turning down Armenian ultimatum, Georgian forces were attacked by Armenians and pushed back to river Khrami. Georgians consolidated and counterattacked, pushing Armenian forces out of the contested area. In January 1919, the British brokered a peace agreement which left northern Lori as a neutral zone between the two countries. Once the British had left the region and the Caucasus as a whole, Armenian forces took control over the region. When Armenia was invaded by Turkish forces in November 1920, Georgia occupied the whole province, with permission by the Armenian government. Following Armenia&#x27;s Sovietization in December 1920, Lori was incorporated into Soviet Armenia on 6 November 1921.

During the Soviet period, modern-day Lori was divided into the raions of Kalinino, Tumanyan (Alaverdi until 1969), Kirovakan, Aragats, Spitak and Stepanavan. After the independence of Armenia, the 6 raions were merged as per the 1995 administrative reform, to form the Lori Province.

In April 2012, a replacement bridge over the Zamarlu gorge just west of Vahagnadzor was opened in order to secure the safe ongoing use of the line to Ayrum, but not before the all station service between Gyumri and Ayrum was discontinued leaving the likes of Spitak and Alaverdi without a passenger service. A new railway link between Vanadzor and Fioletovo (west of Dilijan) has also been proposed.

Stepanavan Airport, located north of Vanadzor, is the nearest airport to the city.

<text>Shirak (, ) is a province () of Armenia. It is located in the north-west of the country, bordering the provinces of Lori to the east and Aragatsotn to the south and southeast, and the countries of Turkey to the west and Georgia to the north. Its capital and largest city is Gyumri, which is the second largest city in Armenia. It is as much semi-desert as it is mountain meadow or high alpine. In the south, the high steppes merge into mountain terrain, being verdant green in the spring, with hues of reddish brown in the summer. The province is served by the Shirak International Airport of Gyumri.

==Etymology==

Shirak Province is named after the Shirak canton of the historical Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenia. The early medieval Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi writes that the name Shirak derives from Shara, who was the great-grandson of Hayk, the legendary patriarch and founder of the Armenian nation. Modern scholars connect Shirak with the name of the Siraces (), a North Caucasian people who may have settled in Shirak and given it its name. According to another view, Shirak derives from /, which is the name given to the region in a cuneiform inscription of the Urartian king Argishti I.

==Geography==

Shirak Province is located in the north-west of Armenia and covers an area of (9% of the total area of Armenia). It borders Lori Province to the east, Aragatsotn Province to the south, the Kars and Ardahan provinces of Turkey to the west and the Samtskhe-Javakheti and Kvemo Kartli regions of Georgia to the north.

Historically, the current territory of the province mainly occupies the Shirak canton of Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenia.

Shirak is mainly dominated by the Ashotsk Plateau (1900 to 2100 meters height) in the north and the Shirak Plain (1400 to 1800 meters height) in the centre and south of the province. The vast plains of the province are surrounded with the Bazum and Pambak mountains from the east, Javakheti Range and Yeghnakhagh mountains from the north and the Aragats mass from the south. Akhurian River at the east, separates Shirak from the Kars Province of Turkey.

The Akhurian River with its reservoir is the main water resource in the province. Lake Arpi at the northwest of Shirak is the only lake of the province. The area is protected by the government as the Lake Arpi National Park.

Shirak is rich with tufa, pumice and limestone.

=== Climate ===
Shirak is the coldest province of Armenia, with the air temperature sometimes reaching under -30 °C in the Shirak Plain and -46 °C on the Ashotsk Plateau. The climate is characterized by extremely cold, snowy winters and mild summers. Precipitation is abundant, with the annual precipitation level reaching up to . In the northern part of the province, winters are long (7 to 8 months) and snow coverage can reach up to a meter.

==History==

===Classical antiquity and Urartu period===

Many ancient human settlements have been found in the Akhurian valley dating back to around 9000 BC. The territory of Shirak has been settled since the early Stone Age. At the higher areas that are above 2000 meters, many remains have been found from the early Bronze Age. Other remains from the 2nd millennium BC, revealed that a civilization was founded between the 20th and 12th centuries BC. With the start of the Iron Age during the 12th century BC, relations among the various ethnic groups of Armenian Highland were developed. Soon after the establishment of the Urartu Kingdom of Van at the end of the 9th century BC, Shirak became part of the kingdom. Two cuneiform inscriptions have been found in Shirak left by King Argishti I () of Urartu, where he wrote about the invasion of the land of &quot;Eriakhi&quot; (the name that Shirak is derived from, according to many historians). According to the inscriptions, the region was home to a well developed civilization based on agriculture and cattle-breeding.

in 720 BC, the Cimmerians conquered the region and probably founded the &quot;Kumayri&quot; settlement (now &quot;Gyumri&quot;), which bears a phonetic resemblance to the word used by ancient Armenian in reference to Cimmerians. Historians believe that Xenophon passed through the territories of Shirak during his return to the Black Sea, a journey immortalized in his Anabasis.

===Achaemenids and the ancient Armenian Kingdom=== 

By the second half of the 6th century BC, Shirak became part of the Achaemenid Empire. The remains of a royal settlement found near the village of Beniamin dating back to the 5th to 2nd centuries BC, are an example of the Achemenid influence in the region. By the beginning of the 5th century BC, Shirak became part of the Satrapy of Armenia under the rule of the Orontids. Later in 331 BC, the entire territory was included in the Ayrarat province of Ancient Armenian Kingdom as part of the Shirak canton.

During the 1st century AD, Shirak was granted to the Kamsarakan family, who ruled the region during the Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia.

===Sasanians and Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia===

Following the partition of Armenia in 387 AD between the Byzantines and the Persians, and as a result of the fall of the Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia in 428, the region of Shirak became part of the Sasanian Empire of Persia.

However, Shirak is home to many early examples of the Armenian church architecture dating back to the 5th century, including the Yererouk, the Saint Mariné Church of Artik, and the Hokevank Monastery.

In 658 AD, during the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Shirak -along with the rest of the Armenian territories- was conquered during the Muslim conquest of Persia, as it was part of Persian-ruled Armenia. It became part of the Emirate of Armenia under the Umayyad Caliphate. However, the Kamsarakan family continued to rule the region under the Arab Islamic rule of Armenia.

By the foundation of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 885, Shirak entered a new era of growth and progress, particularly when the city of Ani of Shirak became the capital of the kingdom in 961. By the second half of the 10th century, Shirak was under the influence of the Armenian Pahlavuni family, who were descendants of the Kamsarakans. The Pahlavunis had a great contribution in the progress of Shirak with the foundation of many fortresses, monastic complexes, educational institutions, etc. The monasteries of Khtzkonk, Harichavank, Marmashen and Horomos were among the prominent religious and educational centres of medieval Armenia.

===Seljuk period, Zakarid Armenia and Turkmen rule===

After the fall of Armenia to the Byzantine Empire in 1045 and later to the Seljuk invaders in 1064, the region entered an era of decline in all social, educational and cultural aspects.

However, with the establishment of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia in 1201 under the Georgian protectorate, the Eastern Armenian territories, mainly Lori and Shirak, entered a new period of growth and stability, becoming a trade centre between the east and the west. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, Armenia turned into a Mongol protectorate as part of the Ilkhanate, and the Zakarids became vassals to the Mongols. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak and Ararat plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.

By the last quarter of the 14th century, the Aq Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, including Shirak. In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Shirak were depopulated. In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the Kara Koyunlu Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian Thomas of Metsoph, although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place.

===Iranian and Russian rule===
In 1501, most of the Eastern Armenian territories including Shirak were conquered by the emerging Safavid dynasty of Iran led by Shah Ismail I. Soon after in 1502, Shirak became part of the newly formed &quot;Erivan Beglarbegi&quot;, a new administrative territory of Iran formed by the Safavids. During the first half of the 18th century, Kumayri became part of the Erivan Khanate under the rule of the Afsharid dynasty and later under the Qajar dynasty of Persia.
In June 1804, the Russian Empire took control of Shirak region at the beginning of the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813. The region became officially part of the Russian Empire at the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 1 January 1813. During the period of the Russian rule, the region witnessed a swift growth and the town of Gyumri became one of the developing cities in Transcaucasia. In 1829, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, there was a big influx of an Armenian population, as around 3,000 families who had migrated from territories in the Ottoman Empire - in particular from the towns of Kars, Erzurum, and Doğubeyazıt- settled in Shirak. The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin visited the region during his journey to the Caucasus and eastern Turkey in 1829.

In 1837 Russian Tsar Nicholas I arrived in Shirak and re-founded the city of Gyumri as Alexandropol. The name was chosen in honour of Tsar Nicholas I&#x27;s wife, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, who had changed her name to &quot;Alexandra Fyodorovna&quot; after converting to Orthodox Christianity. A major Russian fortress was built in Alexandropol in 1837. The city was completely rebuilt by 1840 to become the centre of the newly established Alexandropol Uyezd, experiencing rapid growth during its first decade. The Alexandropol Uyezd included the northern Armenian territories of Shirak, Lori and Tavush.

In 1849, the Alexandropol Uyezd became part of the Erivan Governorate, and Shirak became an important outpost for the Imperial Russian armed forces in the Transcaucasus where their military barracks were established.

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 Shirak became one of the major centres of the Russian troops. After the establishment of the railway station in Alexandropol in 1899, Shirak witnessed a significant growth as centre of trade and industry, becoming the most developed region within eastern Armenia.

===20th century===

After the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian withdrawal from Transcaucasia, the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on 28 May 1918, which included Shirak. On 10 May 1920, the local Bolshevik Armenians aided by the Muslim population, attempted a coup d&#x27;état in Alexandropol against the Dashnak government of Armenia. The uprising was suppressed by the Armenian government on May 14 and its leaders were executed. However, during another Turkish invasion, Turkish troops again attacked Shirak and occupied Alexandropol on 7 November 1920. Armenia was forced to sign the Treaty of Alexandropol on December 3 to stop the Turkish advance towards Yerevan, however a concurrent Soviet invasion led to the fall of the Armenian government on December 2. The Turkish forces withdrew from Alexandropol after the Treaty of Kars was signed in October 1921 by the unrecognized Soviet and Turkish governments.

Under the Bolsheviks, Alexandropol was renamed Leninakan in 1924, after the deceased Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. Shirak became a major industrial region within the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. Leninakan was the second largest city, after the capital Yerevan. However, Shirak, and particularly Leninakan, suffered major damage during the 1988 Armenian earthquake which devastated many parts of northern Armenia. The earthquake occurred along a known thrust fault with a length of . Its strike was parallel to the Caucasus range and dipped to the north-northeast.

From 1930 until 1995, modern-day Shirak was divided into 5 raions (districts) and 1 city of republican subordination within the Armenian SSR: Amasia, Ghukasyan (Ashotsk), Akhurian, Ani, Artik and the city of Leniankan. With the territorial administration reform of 1995, the 5 raions and the city of Gyumri (Leninakan) were merged to form the Shirak Province.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to the 1989 Soviet census, the districts that would later make up Shirak Province (the Amasia, Ani, Artik, Akhuryan, and Ashotsk districts) had a population of 261,217, 147,713 or 56.55% of which was urban, distributed in the cities of Artik (25,126) and Leninakan (122,587), and 113,504 or 43.45% were rural, distributed in the districts of Amasia (6,342), Ani (23,877), Artik (33,665), Akhuryan (38,952), and Ashotsk (10,668).
According to the 2011 official census, Shirak had a de jure population of 251,941 (121,615 men and 130,326 women), forming around 8.3% of the entire population of Armenia. The urban population is 146,908 (58.3%) and the rural is 105,033 (41.7%). The province has 3 urban and 116 rural communities.

There is a significant minority of Armenian Catholics in Shirak. The number of the Catholic population in the province is around 30,000. Gyumri is home to around 20,000, while the rest are found in the surrounding rural settlements. The villages of Arevik, Arpeni, Bavra, Ghazanchi, Marmashen, Mets Sepasar, Panik and Sizavet have a majority of Armenian Catholics, while the village of Azatan has around 1,500 Catholics (30% of village&#x27;s population). As of 2016, Shirak is home to 9 catholic operating churches. The Cathedral of the Holy Martyrs in Gyumri is the seat of the Armenian Catholic Ordinariate of Eastern Europe headed by Archbishop Raphaël François Minassian.

The presence of the small Russian Orthodox community along with the Russian military base personnel in Gyumri is marked with the Saint Alexandra the Martyr&#x27;s Church, Saint Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church and the church of Saint Arsenije.

The small village of Shirakavan has around 30 Yazidi residents.

Prior to the outbreak of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 1988 and the departure of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, Shirak also had an Azerbaijani minority population, almost entirely concentrated in the former Amasia District, where, in 1972, Azerbaijanis constituted 70% of a population of 19,724 people.

==Administrative divisions==
Following the administrative reform of 2021, Shirak Province is divided into six municipalities:
In recent years, many rural settlements in Shirak have become abandoned, including the villages of Akhuryan Kayaran, Aravet, Lorasar and Yerizak.

At the beginning of 2017, the government of Armenia focused on revitalizing the airport. Multiple new airlines began operating flights to the airport, including Taron Avia, a new Armenian airline based in Gyumri, and Pobeda which is a Russian low-cost airline and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aeroflot. In order to attract more customers, the Ministry of Nature Protection made meteorological services free for all airlines flying to Gyumri, lowering ticket costs.

The railway junction of Gyumri is the oldest and the largest one in Armenia. It was formed in 1897 and the first railway link to Alexandropol that connected the city with Tiflis was completed in 1899. The rail line was then extended from Alexandropol to Yerevan (in 1902), Kars (in 1902), Jolfa (in 1906), and Tabriz. As a result, Alexandropol became an important rail hub.

, the Gyumri Railway Station operates regular trips to Yerevan and Batumi. The South Caucasus Railway CJSC, is the current operator of the railway sector in Armenia. The Gyumri-Yerevan railway trip has many stops in Shirak Province, including the stations of Bayandur, Shirakavan, Isahakyan, Aghin kayaran, Jrapi, Bagravan and Aniavan.

The M-7 Motorway passes across the province from east to west, connecting the city of Gyumri with the rest of Armenia.

<doc id="470515" wikidata="Q2523428" url="?curid=470515" title="Syunik Province">
<text>Syunik (, ) is the southernmost province of Armenia. It is bordered by the Vayots Dzor Province to the north, Azerbaijan&#x27;s Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic exclave to the west, Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran to the south. Its capital and largest city is the town of Kapan. The Statistical Committee of Armenia reported its population was 141,771 in the 2011 census, down from 152,684 at the 2001 census.

== Etymology ==

Syunik was one of the 15 provinces of the Kingdom of Armenia. The early Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi connected the name of the province with Sisak, a descendant of the legendary Armenian patriarch Hayk and supposed progenitor of the ancient Siunia (or Syunik) dynasty, which ruled Syunik from the first century CE. However, historian Robert Hewsen considered Sisak to be a later eponym. Historian Armen Petrosyan suggested that Syunik is derived from name of the Urartian sun god Shivini/Siwini (itself a borrowing from the Hittites), noting the similarity between the names and the high number of sun-related placenames in the historical Syunik region. At various times, the region of present-day Syunik was also known by other names such as &quot;Syunia&quot;, &quot;Sisakan&quot; and &quot;Zangezur&quot; (or &quot;Zangadzor&quot;). The region of Syunik geographically was called &quot;Siounia Caucasiana&quot; in the 5-6th century by the Ravenna Cosmography.

== Geography ==
Syunik is located between the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan from the west, and districts of Lachin, Qubadli and Zangilan of Azerbaijan from the east. It was bordered on the east by Kashatagh Province of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic between 1992 and 2020. The Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia forms its northern border, while Aras River at the south separates Syunik from Iran. Syunik covers an area of 4,506 km2 (1740 sq. mi.) (15% of total area of Armenia), making it the second-largest province in Armenia after Gegharkunik in terms of the total area.

Historically, the current territory of the province occupies most of the historic Syunik province of Ancient Armenia.

Syunik is a mountainous region, mainly covered with thick green forests. The Zangezur Mountains occupy most of the territory of Syunik. Mount Kaputjugh with a height of 3905 meters (12,812&#x27;) and Mount Gazanasar with a height of 3829 meters (12,562&#x27;) are the highest peaks of the province.

Many of the forests in Syunik are protected by the government, including the Arevik National Park, the Shikahogh State Reserve, the Boghakar Sanctuary, the Goris Sanctuary, the Plane Grove Sanctuary, the Sev Lake Sanctuary, and the Zangezur Sanctuary.

Major water basins include the rivers of Vorotan, Voghji, Sisian, Meghri and Vachagan. Summer temperature can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F), although the average temperature is around 22 °C (72 °F), while in winter it may reach down to -12.5 °C (9.5 °F). Its border with Nakhchivan to the west is defined by the Zangezur Mountains.

The Meghri mountain ridge at the extreme south of Armenia used to be home to the endangered Caucasian leopard. However, only one was detected by camera trap between August 2006 and April 2007, and no signs of other leopards were found during track surveys conducted over an area of . The local prey base could support 4–10 individuals, but poaching and disturbance caused by livestock breeding, gathering of edible plants and mushrooms, deforestation and human-induced wildfires are so high that they exceed the tolerance of the leopards. During surveys in 2013–2014, camera traps recorded leopards in 24 locations in southern Armenia, of which 14 are located in the Zangezur Mountains.

== History ==
=== Kingdom of Armenia ===

Inscriptions found in the region around Lake Sevan attributed to King Artaxias I confirm that the historic province of Syunik was part of the Artaxiad Kingdom of Armenia during the 2nd century BC.

The first dynasty to rule Syunik was the Siunia dynasty, beginning in the 1st century. The first known &quot;nakharar&quot; ruler was Valinak Siak (c. 330) and his successor was his brother Andok or Andovk (Antiochus, c. 340). In 379, Babik (Bagben) the son of Andok, was re-established as a &quot;nakharar&quot; by the Mamikonian family. Babik had a sister called Pharantzem who had married the Arsacid Prince Gnel, nephew of the Armenian King Arsaces II (Arshak II) and later married Arsaces II as her second husband. Babik&#x27;s rule lasted for less than ten years and by about 386 or 387, Dara was deposed by the Sassanid Empire.

Valinak (c. 400–409) was followed by Vasak (409–452). Vasak had two sons: Babik (Bagben), Bakur and a daughter who married Vasak&#x27;s successor, Varazvahan (452–472). Varazvahan&#x27;s son Gelehon ruled from 470 to 477, who died in 483. Babik (Bagben) the brother of Varazvahan became the new &quot;nakharar&quot; in 477. Hadz the brother of Gelehon died on 25 September 482. The Syunik Province was later governed by Vahan (c. 570), Philip (Philipo, c. 580), Stephen (Stephanos, c. 590–597), Sahak (Isaac, c. 597) and Grigor (Gregory, until 640).

=== Medieval Syunik ===
A dynasty was formed, governed by a branch of the Bagratuni, with minor vassal princes from one or more previous dynasties. Vasak III (c. 800) suffered an assault from the emir of Manazkert, Sevada. He established a garrison in Chalat, in the district of Dzoluk. He then called for help from the Persian revolutionary chief Babak Khorramdin, who married a daughter of the king.

After the death of Vasak III in 821, Babak inherited the country that revolted against him. Babak suppressed the revolt but was harassed by both Muslims and Armenians. Finally, he abdicated and the children of Vasak, Philip and Sahak, regained power. Philip controlled over eastern Syunik, including the cantons of the &quot;Vayots Dzor&quot; and &quot;Baghk&quot;. Sahak governed the western canton of Syunik, known as &quot;Gegharkunik&quot;.

In 826, Sahak allied with his ancient enemy – Sevada, the Qaisite emir of Manazkert – against the governor of Caliph, but he was defeated and died in Kavakert. His son Grigor-Sufan succeeded him as prince of Western Syunik. In the Eastern region, Philipo died on 10 August 848. He was succeeded by three children (Babgen, Vasak-Ichkhanik and Achot) that ruled jointly. Babgen fought with Grigor-Sufan and killed him (sometime in 849–851) but Babgen died shortly after (851) and Vasak-Ichkhanik (Vasak IV) followed him. Vasak-Ichkhanik had peaceful relations with Vasak-Gabor, who had ascended to the throne of Western Syunik, replacing his father Grigor-Sufan. Nerseh Pilippean, brother of Babgen, directed (822–23) an expedition to Aghuania defeating and killing the prince Varaz-Terdat II (of the Persian dynasty Mihrakane of Aghuania) in Morgog. A general sent by the Caliph, Bugha al-Kabir, destroyed Armenia and Aghuania in these years and sent a detachment to Eastern Syunik where was governing Vasak IV with his brother Achot. The people of Syunik were sheltered in the fortress of Balq, but Vasak fled to Kotaiq, and was pursued to the region of Gardman on the eastern border of Lake Sevan. Gardman&#x27;s prince (ichkhan) Ketridj or Ketritchn betrayed him and delivered him to Bogha (859). Achot was also seized (859). But Bogha invaded Gardman and imprisoned Kertridj. He then went to Outi where he captured the prince of Sevordiq, Stephannos Kun.
The Caliphate tried to control all these regions, and for this reason, Bogha decided to repopulate the city of Chamkor in the Kura River with Muslims. Chamkor, being near Barda and Ganja, was intended to act as a regional monitoring post. By order of the new Caliph in 862, the imprisoned princes were to be released and allowed to return to their former domains on the condition of becoming Muslim. (However, they all abandoned Islam after their return.)

The prince of Western Syunik, Vasak-Gabor, was married to a daughter of the Bagratid prince Ashot the Great named Miriam and received the title of Ichkhan from the Syunik people – delivered to him by Ashot in name of the Caliph. His successor was his son, Grigor-Sufan II (887–909). The prince of Eastern Syunik, Vasak IV, died around 887 and was followed by his brother Achot who died c. 906.
The son of Vasak IV, Sembat, that received the fiefdom from Vayots Dzor. Chahaponk (Jahuk) governed from 887 until sometime after 920. He revolted in 903 against the Bagratid Sembat I, refusing to pay him taxes. Because of this, he was assaulted by the prince of Vaspurakan, Sargis-Ashot. Sembat submitted, was forgiven and married to the sister of the prince of Vaspurakan, receiving the city and district of Nakhchivan, which in 902 was upset with the Kaysites or Qaisids.

A few years later, the prince allied with the emir of Sadjid, Yusuf, against Eastern Syunik, which they invaded together. Sembat was sheltered in the fortress of Erendchak (today Alinja, northeast of Nakhchivan) and Yusuf remained owner of Eastern Syunik. Sembat requested refuge from his brother-in-law Khatchik-Gagik, which was granted. In the same year (909), the prince of Western Syunik, Grigor Sufan II, submitted to the emir Yusuf in Dwin. Only Byzantine movements and the withdrawal of the Sadjids permitted him to recover the throne sometime later. Sembat, with his three brothers Sahak, Babgen, and Vasak, governed again. Also in Western Syunik, Sahak, Ashot and Vasak, brothers of Grigor-Sufan II, were governing the country. After them the dynasty of Western Syunik became extinct and the territory was subsumed by the Muslims.

The eastern part remained divided: Sembat, which had the main title, governed the western part of the Eastern Syunik with the Vayots Dzor, bordered by Vaspurakan. Sahak governed the eastern part until the river Hakar. Babgen governed the district of the Baghk, and Vasak (who died in 922) an indeterminate territory. Nasr, the emir of Azerbaijan, captured territory through perfidy against Babgen and Sahak in Dwin. After the invasion, Sembat unseated Nasr and obtained the freedom of his brothers. Sembat was followed by his son Vasak, and Sahak in turn by his son Sembat. Vasak received the royal title from the Muslims at the end of his reign, which lasted until 963.

The throne was inherited by his nephew Sembat (963–998) who was recognized as king by the emirs of Tauris and of Arran. He was married to the princess of Aghuania, Chahandoukht. At his death, he was followed by Vasak (c. 998–1019). Vasak was succeeded by two nephews (the children of his sister and a Prince Achot) called Sembat and Grigor (1019–1084). During his periods Syunik was vassal of Great Seljuk Empire. Grigor was married with the princess Chahandoukht, daughter of Sevada of Aghuania. The only successor to the two princes, was a daughter of Grigor&#x27;s called Chahandoukht. Rule passed to the prince of Aghuania, Seneqerim Ioan who governed both territories from 1084 until his death in 1105. Seneqerim Ioan was followed by his son Grigor of Syunik and Aghuania, who governed until 1166 when the country was conquered by the Seljuq Turks. It was ruled by Seljuks of Hamadan, Atabegs of Azerbaijan, Kingdom of Georgia, Khwarezmshahs, Ilkhanate, Chupanids, Jalayirids, Kara Koyunlu, Timurid Empire and Aq Qoyunlu successively before Safavid rule. It mostly had autonomous rule and was for some periods fully independent under the Armenian meliks
Later, the Orbelian dynasty, one of whose members wrote an important history of the country, governed Syunik in times of Timur (Tamerlan) as vassals.

=== Iranian rule ===
Between the middle of the 18th century and early in the 19th century, the Syunik was part of the Karabakh khanate of the Safavid Empire. It was also ruled by the Ottomans between 1578 and 1606 and again between 1722 and 1736.

By the beginning of the 18th century, Syunik was associated with the Armenian military leader David Bek, who led the liberation campaign of the Armenians of Syunik against Safavid Persia and the invading Ottoman Turks. David Bek started his battles in 1722 with the help of thousands of local Armenian patriots who liberated Syunik. The centre of David Bek&#x27;s struggle was the Baghaberd Fortress northwest of Kapan and Halidzor Fortress southwest of Kapan where he died in 1728.

=== Imperial Russian rule ===
Following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13, Syunik -along with the rest of Karabakh Khanate- passed into Imperial Russian possession, officially signed in the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813. The khanate was abolished by the Russian government in 1822. The region was divided between the Erivan Governorate, and Baku Governorate (known as &quot;Shemakha Governorate&quot; until 1859). When the Elisabethpol Governorate was established in 1868, the region became part of the Zangezursky Uyezd, with its administration based in the town of Geryusy starting from 1870.

According to the official census of the Russian Empire in 1897, the total population of Zangezursky Uyezd was 137,971, with 51.6% of them were Caucasian Tatars and 46,1% were Armenians.

The beginning of 20th century saw an outbreak in ethnic tensions between the Armenian and Tatar populations in the Caucasus, culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres. Clashes occurred in Nakhchivan and Sharur-Daralgez uyezdy of the Erevan gubernia and in Zangezur, Shusha and Javanshir uezdy of Elizavetpol gubernia in 1905. According to Armenian sources 128 Armenian and 158 Azerbaijanian villages were &quot;pillaged or destroyed&quot; while the overall estimates of lives lost vary widely, ranging from 3,000 to 10,000, with Muslims suffering higher losses. During these events, the Armenians of Syunik were massacred &quot;without distinction of sex or age&quot; by Azeri forces, and children were mutilated.

Tensions were accelerated with the collapse of the Russian Empire. The region fell under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Zangezur, Nakhchivan, and Nagorno-Karabakh became heavily contested between the newly formed and short-lived states of the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. At the time, Syunik had an Armenian majority of 350,000 and a Muslim population of 180,000. According to Thomas de Waal, the dispute over Syunik resulted in the displacement of region&#x27;s Caucasian Tatar minority through direct military action by Armenian guerrilla commanders Andranik, Rouben Ter Minassian and later Garegin Nzhdeh.

=== Republic of Armenia ===

Between 1918 and 1920 Syunik was included in the short-lived Republic of Armenia. After the Sovietization of Armenia, Syunik became the main centre of the resistance against the Bolsheviks, thus becoming part of the unrecognized Republic of Mountainous Armenia. The city of Goris became the capital of the unrecognized state, and Garegin Nzhdeh was chosen as prime minister and minister of defence. Later, in July, Simon Vratsian took the office as prime minister while Nzhdeh became the governor and the general commander. Nzhdeh actively engaged in expelling the 3/5th Azerbaijani population of Zangezur.

Between April and July 1921, the Red Army conducted massive military operations in the region, attacking Syunik from the north and east. After months of fierce battles with the Red Army, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia capitulated in July 1921 following Soviet Russia&#x27;s promises to keep the mountainous region as a part of Soviet Armenia. After the conflict, Garegin Nzhdeh, his soldiers, and many prominent Armenian intellectuals, including leaders of the Republic of Armenia, crossed the border into the neighbouring city of Tabriz in Persia. Thus, Syunik became part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1921.

=== Soviet Syunik ===

Armenian forces eventually secured the region but their efforts were in vain when the Bolsheviks, successful in the Russian Civil War, pushed deep into the Caucasus. Syunik was one of the last major holdouts of the independent Armenian state whose leaders were eventually expelled by incoming Soviet authorities to Iran. During Sovietization, Syunik became part of Soviet Armenia, while the two other disputed territories, Nakhchivan and Nagorno-Karabakh became part of Soviet Azerbaijan. It then became part of Armenia under the Transcaucasian SFSR and part of the Armenian SSR in 1936. Under Soviet rule, Syunik suffered a devastating earthquake in April 1931, leaving 80% of its villages destroyed. A subsequent earthquake hit the region in May during the same year, destroying 27 of 38 villages in the Sisian district.

As an administrative unit, modern-day Syunik was divided into the raions of Meghri, Kapan, Goris and Sisian.

Despite the region&#x27;s troubled early years in the Soviet Union, it gradually began to recover with much of the area&#x27;s infrastructure rebuilt and improved. During the Soviet era, Syunik was noted as a source of metal and ore production. However, the region was shaken by the renewal of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh with neighbouring Azerbaijan. In 1987–1989, the remaining Azeri inhabitants fled the region as a result of interethnic violence. This exodus of Azeri population made Syunik and Armenia, in general, more homogeneous.

=== Independence of Armenia ===

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Syunik has been a constituent part of the Republic of Armenia. After the independence of Armenia, the 4 rayons of Soviet Syunik were merged during the 1995 administrative reform to form the Syunik Province with the town of Kapan as the provincial capital.

Being the republic&#x27;s southernmost province, it has gained a strategic and economic importance for Armenia. The border with Iran enhanced the export of vital energy resources from Armenia to Iran and other regions. Recently, a new 140-kilometer-long Armenia-Iran pipeline has been opened, projected to supply Armenia with up to 1.1 billion m3 of gas per year until 2019, when the target of the supply is expected to rise to 2.3 billion m3 annually.&quot; The new pipeline attracted Armenia&#x27;s northern neighbor Georgia, seeking to lessen its dependence on energy from Russia.

In 2000, an old cemetery was found between the villages of Kornidzor and Khndzoresk near Goris. It was built during the Kara Koyunlu rule.

As a result of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, the territories to the east of Syunik, which had been under Armenian control since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, came under Azerbaijani control, lengthening the province&#x27;s border with Azerbaijan and creating fears about the province&#x27;s security. In one border settlement in Syunik, Shurnukh, 12 houses came under the control of Azerbaijan after being found to be located on the Azerbaijani side of the border. Additionally, several parts of the important highway between Goris and Kapan came under Azerbaijani control.

The ninth point of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement that ended the 2020 war stated that &quot;All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions.&quot; The president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev insists that this means that Armenia is obligated to provide a &quot;corridor&quot; to Azerbaijan through Syunik and threatened to establish the &quot;corridor&quot; by force if Armenia does not oblige. Prime minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan rejected this, arguing that the ceasefire agreement does not call for a corridor through Syunik but for the general opening of transportation routes between the two countries. Starting on 12 May 2021, Azerbaijani forces crossed several kilometers into Armenian territory in Syunik and occupied the area around Lake Sev in Syunik, precipitating a border crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On 10 November 2021 it was announced the alternate Goris-Kapan highway completely within Armenia&#x27;s borders was completed.

<doc id="470516" wikidata="Q201140" url="?curid=470516" title="Tavush Province">
<text>Tavush (, ) is a province of Armenia located at the northeast of Armenia, bordered by Georgia from the north and Azerbaijan from the east. Internally, Tavush borders the Gegharkunik Province from the south, Kotayk Province from the southwest, and the Lori Province from west. The capital and largest city of the province is the town of Ijevan.

==Etymology==

The name of the province is derived from &quot;Tavush&quot;; a variant of the original name of the Tuchkatak canton of the historical Utik province of Ancient Armenia. It first appeared during the 9th century as the name of the 9th-century Bagratid fortress near modern-day Berd.

==Geography==

Tavush has an area of 2,704 km2 (9% of total area of Armenia). It occupies the northeastern part of Armenia. It is bordered by Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east. Domestically, it is bordered by the Gegharkunik Province from the south, Kotayk Province from the southwest and Lori Province from west. The territory is mainly mountainous and rocky hillsides covered with a green carpet of Alpine meadows. Tavush is sometimes referred to as a little Armenian Switzerland. The average height of the region is around 900 meters above sea level.

Based on the historical divisions of Ancient Armenia, the current territory of the province occupies parts of the Varazhnunik canton of Ayrarat province, the Dzorapor and Koghbapor cantons of Gugark province, and the Aghve and Tuchkatak (Tavush) cantons of Utik province.
The province entirely lies among the mountains of the Lesser Caucasus. It is surrounded by the Miapor mountains from the east, the Somkheti mountains from the north, the Gugark mountains from the east and the Kenats mountains from the south. The highest point of Tavush is the Miapor peak with a height of 2993 meters, while the lowest point is located at a height of 380 meters in the Debed river valley near the village of Debedavan.

The province is a major source of water in Armenia. The main source is Aghstev river with its tributaries Getik, Voskepar and Sarnajur. Minor rivers include Akhum, Tavush and Khndzorut.

Tavush is also rich for its mountain springs, mineral water and small lakes such as the Lake Parz and Lake Gosh.

Most of the Tavush territory is covered with thick forests, mainly around the towns of Dilijan, Ijevan and Berd. The province has a number of protected forests including the Dilijan National Park, Akhnabad Taxus Grove Sanctuary, Arjatkhelni Hazel Sanctuary, Gandzakar Sanctuary, Ijevan Sanctuary and Zikatar Sanctuary.
==History==
The territories of present-day Lori and Tavush along with the neighboring Georgia, became part of the Russian Empire in 1800–01. The territories became an official region of Russia as per the Treaty of Gulistan signed between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia in October 1813, following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–13. In 1840, the Elizavetpol uezd was formed and most of the territories of Tavush were included in this new administrative division of the Russian Empire. Later in 1868, the Elisabethpol Governorate was established and Tavush became part of the newly formed Kazakh uezd of the governorate.

From 1930 until 1995, modern-day Tavush was divided into 3 districts within the Armenian SSR: Ijevan raion, Noyemberyan raion, and Shamshadin raion. With the territorial administration reform of 1995, the 3 raions were merged to form the Tavush Province.

In July 2020, Tavush became the main site for the clashes with Azerbaijan.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to the 1989 Soviet census, the Tavush Province (then part of the Shamshadin, Noyemberyan, and Ijevan districts in 1930–1995) had a population of 144,583. 49,114 or 33.97% of which was urban, distributed into the cities of Dilijan (30,433) and Ijevan (18,681), and 95,469 or 66.03% were rural, distributed into the districts of Shamshadin (34,559), Noyemberyan (33,973), and Ijevan (26,937).
Tavush is the second least populated province in Armenia. According to the 2011 official census, Tavush has a population of 128,609 (62,083 men and 66,526 women), forming around 4.3% of the entire population of Armenia. The urban population is 54,186 (42.1%) and the rural is 74,423 (57.9%). The province has 5 urban and 55 rural communities. The largest urban community is the provincial center of Ijevan, with a population of 21,081. The other urban centres Dilijan, Berd, Noyemberyan and Ayrum.

With a population of 4,420, the village of Koghb is the largest rural municipality of Tavush.

===Ethnic groups and religion===
The majority of the Tavush Province population are ethnic Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The regulating body of the church is the Diocese of Tavush, headed by Bishop Bagrat Galstanyan. The Surp Nerses Cathedral in Ijevan is the seat of the diocese.

The town of Berd is home to around 200 Udis who also belong to the Armenian Church.

A tiny community of Yazidis is found in Dilijan.

==Administrative divisions==

As a result of the administrative reforms that took place on 15 December 2015, 17 June 2016, 16 July 2016 and 9 June 2017, Tavush is currently divided into 24 municipal communities (&quot;hamaynkner&quot;), of which 5 are urban, and 19 are rural:

During recent years, many rural settlements in Tavush have been abandoned, including the villages of Chermakavan, Chirchiri, Geghatap, Gomer, Shamakhyan and Tarsachay.

<doc id="470518" wikidata="Q200124" url="?curid=470518" title="Vayots Dzor Province">
<text>Vayots Dzor (, ) is a province (&quot;marz&quot;) of Armenia. It lies at the southeastern end of the country, bordering the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan to the west and the Kalbajar District of Azerbaijan to the east. It covers an area of . With a population of only 52,324 (2011 census), it is the most sparsely populated province in the country. The capital and largest city of the province is the town of Yeghegnadzor.

The province is home to many ancient landmarks and tourist attractions in Armenia including the Areni-1 cave complex and Areni-1 winery of the Chalcolithic period, the 8th-century Tanahat Monastery, the 10th-century fortress of Smbataberd, and the 13th-century monastery of Noravank. Vayots Dzor is also home to the spa-town of Jermuk.

The village of Gladzor in Vayots Dzor was home to the 13th and 14th-century University of Gladzor.

==Etymology==

The province is named after the Vayots Dzor canton of historic Syunik, the ninth province of Ancient Armenia. The exact etymology of the name Vayots Dzor is unknown, although it is popularly understood to mean &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;canyon of sorrows&quot; (&quot;vay&quot; is an exclamation of sorrow or pain in Armenian, a cognate of the word &quot;woe&quot;). According to folk tradition, the region received this name after a powerful earthquake struck the area. Historian Grigor Ghapantsyan considers it more likely that the name Vayots Dzor derives from the name of an ancient tribe or ethnic group with the name &quot;Vay&quot;, perhaps connected with &quot;Biaini&quot;, the endonym of the ancient kingdom of Urartu.

==Geography==

Situated at the southeastern end of modern-day Armenia, Vayots Dzor covers an area of 2,308 km2 (7.8% of total area of Armenia). It the most sparsely populated province in the country. It borders the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan from the west and the Kalbajar District of Azerbaijan from the east (administered as the Shahumyan Region of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic between 1993 and 2020). Domestically, it is bordered by the Gegharkunik Province from the north, Ararat Province from the northwest and Syunik Province from the southeast.

Historically, the current territory of the province occupies most of the &quot;Vayots Dzor&quot; canton of the historic Syunik province of Ancient Armenia.

Vayots Dzor is a mountainous region. It is mainly divided into 3 mountain ranges: the Vardenis mountain range at the north, the Arpa range in the middle and the Vayk range at the south. At a height of 3522 meters, the Vardenis volcano in the north is the highest point in the province, while the Areni valley, at a height of 850 meters, is the lowest point. The 2586 meters-high &quot;Vayots Sar&quot; volcanic cone is located almost at the centre of the province.

Vayots Dzor has many rivers, mountains springs and mineral water, with the Arpa River being the most significant of them. It flows 92 km in the territory of Vayots Dzor, through the settlements of Jermuk, Vayk, Yeghegnadzor, and Areni, among others. It originates in Vayots Dzor from the northwest part of the Syunik plateau at a height of 3260 meters, and flows into the Araks river. It has a number of tributaries that form waterfalls such as the Jermuk and the Herher.

Yeghegis river is the main tributary of Arpa. It flows into a valley that is protected by the government as a wildlife sanctuary.

Most of the rivers in Vayots Dzor are characterized by swift flow, deep fall and inclination. A large project was completed during the Soviet period to transfer the water of Arpa river to Lake Sevan. Thus, an underground water tunnel was opened in 1981 that starts from the basin of the Kechut reservoir to transfer the flow of the Arpa river into Kake Sevan.

A number of small lakes are also found in the valley of the Herher River.

==History==

Vayots Dzor is first mentioned in the &quot;History of Armenia&quot; by Movses Khorenatsi. The region has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations have uncovered many sites and objects dating back to the Paleolithic Era and the Bronze Age, including carvings on cliffs depicting scenes of hunting and animals. The Areni-1 cave complex—including the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery—discovered in archaeological excavations conducted between 2007 and 2011, revealed that the region was settled during the 5th millennium BC (Late Chalcolithic Age). The winery consists of fermentation vats, a wine press, storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be the earliest known winery in history. A 5500-year-old leather shoe, the oldest known piece of leather footwear, has also been found in Areni-1.

As early as the 8th century BC, the area of modern-day Vayots Dzor was part of the Kingdom of Urartu. Later, it became part of the Kingdom of Armenia forming the &quot;Vayots Dzor&quot; canton of the Syunik Province. 

Many churches, monastic complexes, bridges and caravanserais were built between the 10th and 13th centuries, when Vayots Dzor was part of the Kingdom of Syunik under the rule of the Siunia dynasty.

During the Middle Ages, the Silk Road passed through the area of Vayots Dzor, particularly the road that currently links the town of Martuni with Yeghegnadzor. Vayots Dzor was home to one of the earliest higher educational centres of medieval Armenia, the University of Gladzor; founded around 1280 by Nerses of Mush.

The period between the 15th and 17th centuries is considered to be the darkest period in the history of Vayots Dzor. The region became a frequent battlefield between the invading troops of the Turkic and Iranian tribes. As a result, many monuments and villages were destroyed and the population was displaced. It later became part of the Khanate of Nakhchivan and was known as &quot;Daralagez&quot; (also spelled Daralagyaz, Daralayaz).

During the first half of the 19th century, following the Russo-Persian War of 1826-28 and the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay signed in 1828, Vayots Dzor passed from Iranian to Russian rule. In the same year that the territory came under Russian rule, it was incorporated into the newly established Armenian Oblast. In 1849, the Erivan Governorate was founded including Vayots Dzor, while in 1870, the governorate was further divided into uyezds. Consequently, Vayots Dzor became part of the Sharur-Daralagezsky Uyezd of the Erivan Governorate.

Between 1918 and 1920, the region was included within the short-lived Republic of Armenia. After the Sovietization of Armenia, Vayots Dzor became one of the regions that resisted Soviet Communist rule and formed the unrecognized Republic of Mountainous Armenia under the leadership of Garegin Nzhdeh. However, after falling to the Bolsheviks in July 1921, Vayots Dzor became part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

During the Soviet period, modern-day Vayots Dzor was divided into the raions of Yeghegnadzor and Azizbekov. After the independence of Armenia, the 2 raions were merged during the 1995 administrative reform to form the Vayots Dzor Province.

Vayots Dzor is among the leading provinces of Armenia in wine production in terms of grape cultivation and wine export (along with the provinces of Ararat and Armavir). Internationally renowned winemaker Paul Hobbs and the Yacoubian family journey to the Birthplace of Wine to craft modern, world-class wines from the indigenous varieties found in the high-altitude, mineral-rich soils of Vayots Dzor.

Their vineyards grow a stone&#x27;s throw away from the Areni-1 cave, the oldest known winery dating from over 6000 years ago.

<text>Nils Ferlin (11 December 1898 – 21 October 1961) was a Swedish poet and lyricist.

==Biography==

Nils Ferlin was born in Karlstad, Värmland, where his father worked at &quot;Nya Wermlands-Tidningen&quot;. In 1908, the family moved to Filipstad, and his father started his own newspaper. His father died the next year, however, and the family moved from their comfortable residence to a humbler dwelling in the industrial district so that Ferlin could finish his education. He graduated at the age of sixteen.

Ferlin had a minor career as an actor and debuted at the age of seventeen in &quot;Salomé&quot; by Oscar Wilde. He continued his career with a traveling theater company.

Although many of Ferlin&#x27;s poems are melancholic, they are not without humor. Several were set to music and became popular songs such as &quot;En valsmelodi&quot;, an attack on the music industry. Ferlin sold over 300,000 volumes of his poetry during his lifetime. His lasting appeal is partly attributed to his vivid portrayal of central Stockholm before urban renewal and his association with the popular culture that flourished there then.

Several statues of Nils Ferlin have been erected in Sweden: one in Filipstad of him sitting on a park bench, one in the Karlstad city square of him standing on a table, and one near Klara kyrka in Stockholm of him lighting a cigarette.

Ferlin’s lyrics have been translated into English by Martin S. Allwood, Fred Lane, Thord Fredenholm and Roger Hinchliffe.

<text>McBurney&#x27;s point is the point over the right side of the abdomen that is one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus (navel). This is near the most common location of the appendix.

== Location ==
McBurney&#x27;s point is located one third of the distance from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus (navel). This point roughly corresponds to the most common location of the base of the appendix, where it is attached to the cecum.

=== Appendicitis ===
Deep tenderness at McBurney&#x27;s point, known as McBurney&#x27;s sign, is a sign of acute appendicitis. The clinical sign of referred pain in the epigastrium when pressure is applied is also known as Aaron&#x27;s sign. Specific localization of tenderness to McBurney&#x27;s point indicates that inflammation is no longer limited to the lumen of the bowel (which localizes pain poorly), and is irritating the lining of the peritoneum at the place where the peritoneum comes into contact with the appendix. 

Tenderness at McBurney&#x27;s point suggests the evolution of acute appendicitis to a later stage, and thus, the increased likelihood of rupture. Other abdominal processes can also sometimes cause tenderness at McBurney&#x27;s point. Thus, this sign is highly useful but neither necessary nor sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The anatomical position of the appendix is highly variable (for example in retrocaecal appendix, an appendix behind the caecum), which also limits the use of this sign, as many cases of appendicitis do not cause point tenderness at McBurney&#x27;s point. For most open appendectomies (as opposed to laparoscopic appendectomies), the incision is made at McBurney&#x27;s point.

=== Pseudoaneurysm ===
A pseudoaneurysm in the aorta may be treated surgically, with an incision made between McBurney&#x27;s point and the lower intercostal spaces.

=== Peritoneal dialysis ===
McBurney&#x27;s point may be a useful site for insertion of a peritoneal dialysis catheter.

==History==
McBurney&#x27;s point is named after American surgeon Charles McBurney (1845–1913). McBurney himself did not locate his point in a precise way in his original article.

<text>The Brewster Hospital building is a historic U.S. hospital in the LaVilla neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida. It was located at 915 West Monroe Street. On May 13, 1976, the building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In 2005, it was moved across the street to 843 West Monroe Street.

==History==
Brewster Hospital was the first Black hospital in Jacksonville. It served African Americans in Jacksonville from 1901 to 1966. It was founded in 1901 as the George A. Brewster Hospital and School of Nurse Training, because there was no place for Black people to go to for treatment after the disastrous Great Fire of 1901. Its sponsor was the Women&#x27;s Division of the Methodist Board of Missions. (As in other Southern cities, white hospitals did not treat Black residents before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) The hospital began at the West Monroe building, later expanding to East Jacksonville and Springfield. Abbie Sweetwine, the military nurse dubbed &quot;The Angel of Platform 6&quot; for her work during the British Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash, under took her initial training as a nurse at Brewster Hospital.

The hospital closed in 1966 because, like Florida A&amp;M Hospital, the forced integration of white hospitals meant it lost its funding. Its Springfield building was gutted and rebuilt as Methodist Hospital, opening in 1967. The building that replaced it became Methodist Medical Center in 1993, and in 1999 merged with University Medical Center to become the Shands Jacksonville Medical Center, an affiliate of the University of Florida and Shands HealthCare.

The original Brewster Hospital building was first constructed in 1885 as a private residence. It was purchased for use as a hospital in 1901 and remained occupied until the hospital&#x27;s demise in 1966. In the mid-2000s, the city of Jacksonville relocated the building to a parcel of land down the street and spent $1.2 million rehabilitating it for a new use. As of 2020, North Florida Land Trust is its primary tenant.

<text>Henry Chapman Mercer (June 24, 1856 – March 9, 1930) was an American archeologist, artifact collector, tile-maker, and designer of three distinctive poured concrete structures: Fonthill, his home; the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works; and the Mercer Museum.

==Biography==

Henry Mercer was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on June 24, 1856. Mercer first traveled to Europe in 1870. He attended Harvard University between 1875 and 1879, obtaining a liberal arts degree. Mercer went on to study law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School between 1880 and 1881, and he read law with the firm of Freedley and Hollingsworth. The same year he began studying at the University of Pennsylvania, he became a founding member of the Bucks County Historical Society.

Mercer, however, never practiced law; he was admitted to the Philadelphia County Bar on November 9, 1881, but departed for Europe the same month. From 1881 to 1889, he traveled extensively through France and Germany.

The University of Pennsylvania Museum appointed Mercer as the Curator of American and Prehistoric Archaeology in the early 1890s. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1895. Leaving his position with the Museum in the late 1890s, Mercer devoted himself to finding old American artifacts and learning about German pottery. Mercer believed that American society was being destroyed by industrialism, which inspired his search for American artifacts. Mercer founded Moravian Pottery and Tile Works in 1898 after apprenticing himself to a Pennsylvania German potter. He was also influenced by the American Arts and Crafts Movement.

Mercer is well known for his research and books about ancient tool making, his ceramic tile creations, and his engineering and architecture. He was among the paleontologists who investigated Port Kennedy Bone Cave. He wrote extensively on his interests, which included archaeology, early tool making, German stove plates, and ceramics. He also published a collection of tales of the supernatural, &quot;November Night Tales&quot; in 1928. 
He assembled the collection of early American tools now housed in the Mercer Museum. Mercer&#x27;s tiles are used in the floor of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and in many other noteworthy buildings and houses. In the Pennsylvania State Capitol, Mercer created a series of mosaic images for the floor of the building. The series of four hundred mosaics trace the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from prehistoric times, and is the largest single collection of Mercer&#x27;s tiles. Other collections of tiles by Mercer can be found at Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, New York; Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California; the Casino at Monte Carlo in Monaco; the St. Louis Public Library; and the former Morton (Richmond) High School Building in Richmond, Indiana.

Besides making mosaics, Mercer also painted, drew, and wrote poetry. Sometimes, he blended these interests together, such as in the pastel painting &quot;October&quot;, which also showcases his fascination with rural life.

Mercer was an outspoken opponent of the plume trade.

Henry Ford stated that the Mercer museum was the only museum worth visiting in the United States, and the Mercer Museum was apparently Henry Ford&#x27;s inspiration for his own museum, The Henry Ford, located in Dearborn, Michigan. The Mercer Museum houses over forty thousand artifacts from early American society. Mercer died on March 9, 1930, at Fonthill, the house he designed and constructed from reinforced concrete in 1908-1912.

The Bucks County Historical Society now owns Fonthill, which is open to the public, and the Mercer Museum. The Moravian Pottery and Tile Works is owned by the Bucks County Department of Parks &amp; Recreation and operated as a working history museum by The TileWorks of Bucks County, a non-profit organization. These three buildings make up &quot;the Mercer Mile&quot;. All three buildings were designed and constructed by Henry Mercer in the early part of the 20th century.

<doc id="470545" wikidata="Q4077635" url="?curid=470545" title="Barazoku">
<text>was Japan&#x27;s first commercially circulated gay men&#x27;s magazine. It began publication in July 1971 by Daini Shobō&#x27;s owner&#x27;s son and editor , although before that, there had been &quot;Adonis&quot; and &quot;Apollo&quot;, its extra issue, around 1960 serving as a members-only magazine. &quot;Barazoku&quot; was Japan&#x27;s oldest and longest-running monthly magazine for gay men. However, it halted publication three times due to the publisher&#x27;s financial hardships. In 2008, Itō announced that the 400th issue would be the final one. The title means &quot;the rose tribe&quot; in Japanese, hinted from King Laius&#x27; homosexual episodes in Greek mythology. The magazine was printed in Japanese only. &quot;Barazoku&quot;&#x27;s Bungaku Itō coined the term for the Japanese lesbian community as (&quot;lily tribe&quot;) which the slang term for lesbian &quot;yuri&quot; comes from.

==Features==
Along with much Japanese gay culture, gay magazines in Japan are segregated by type, aimed at an audience with specific interests. &quot;Barazoku&quot;, however, attempted to reach a broad audience and thus contained &quot;a little something for everybody&quot;. A typical issue of &quot;Barazoku&quot; had approximately 300 pages, including several pages of glossy color and black and white photographs of younger, fit men in their late teens and twenties (these photographs were censored in accordance with Japan&#x27;s rules, which require the obscuring of genitals and pubic hair). Despite the inclusion of pornographic pictures, however, &quot;Barazoku&quot; was not a pornographic magazine.

The bulk of a typical issue of &quot;Barazoku&quot; consisted of articles and short stories, advice, how-tos, interviews, news, arts, and community listings. Compared to other gay magazines like &quot;Badi&quot;, &quot;Barazoku&quot; typically had fewer pictures and manga stories and less news, which may have contributed to its demise.

Much of the magazine&#x27;s revenue came from &quot;personal ads&quot; – advertisements placed by readers in search of romantic attachments, friends or sex partners. Such advertisements had long been a popular way for gay men to meet each other in Japan, but the advent of the internet, with its free dating sites, also contributed to the magazine&#x27;s eventual end, especially when such sites became accessible from mobile phones.

Along with the rise in internet use and a decrease in paid advertising, &quot;Barazoku&quot; blamed its demise on the increasing inclusion of gay news in mainstream publications.

&quot;Barazoku&quot; was Japan&#x27;s oldest gay magazine, and was in print for 33 years. First published in 1971, &quot;Barazoku&quot; was considered a trailblazer for other gay publications and a leader in Japanese gay culture. In its 33 years, the magazine survived despite mainstream disapproval and legal injunctions.

&quot;Barazoku&quot; was the first gay magazine in Asia to be sold at mainstream bookshops, such as Kinokuniya. It became such a cultural phenomenon that its title has entered the mainstream language as a synonym for &quot;gay&quot; and gay manga.

In its early years, the magazine published artwork by Go Mishima and Rune Naito. Founder Ito&#x27;s determination to fight discrimination led the magazine to publish an interview with Japan&#x27;s first known AIDS sufferer at a time when the mainstream media refused to address the issue.

The demise of &quot;Barazoku&quot; may have come as a blow to gays in isolated communities in Japan: the magazine&#x27;s strongest sales came from small, independent bookshops in such areas.

Several attempts were made to restart the magazine: twice in 2005, and then again in 2007.

==Publication history==

===Origins===
Bungaku Ito, the magazine&#x27;s promoter, had been publishing books for oppressed gay people in Japan since 1968, such as and . With their success, he became confident that Japan&#x27;s first gay magazine would also be welcomed. In 1970, Ito announced in one of his publications his intent to launch a gay magazine in order to reduce prejudices in mainstream culture and to encourage gay people that they deserved better lives and brighter futures. As a result, two men, Ryu Fujita and Hiroshi Mamiya, contacted Ito for employment as editors. Fortunately for heterosexual Ito, both of them were gay and experienced writers/editors, having worked for minor magazines. As Ito lacked experience in publishing magazines, most content in the first issue of &quot;Barazoku&quot;, including essays, photographs and illustrations, were made by Fujita and Mamiya. In the meantime, Ito attempted to convince bookstore agencies like Tohan that offering his magazine in mainstream bookstores would be profitable. Initially, Tohan rejected it, thinking that neither men nor women would be interested in this genre of magazine, but finally accepted it as Ito&#x27;s other books for gay people had outsold their expectations.

The magazine was named &quot;Barazoku&quot; (The Rose Tribe) by Ito since the rose had been a prominent symbol of male homosexuality in Japan, derived from the Greek myth of the King Laius having affairs with boys under rose trees. The first issue was published on 30 July 1971, with 72 pages including only 6 pages of nude photographs, and the price was 260 yen a copy. It was sold in major bookstores such as Books Kinokuniya in Shinjuku and Shibuya. Most of the first 10,000 copies were sold out shortly. After that, the news of the successful launch of Japan&#x27;s first gay magazine became a hot topic in other magazines. Ito reasoned that the popularity was due to the fact that the two editors&#x27; favorite &quot;type&quot; was sporty young men, which was popular among gay readers.

===1970s and controversies===
Encouraged by the first issue&#x27;s success, Ito published a second issue in November 1972. However, one of the nude photographs titled &quot;Summer of &#x27;52: Omoide no Natsu&quot; (Summer Memories) was found obscene by censorship authorities because the pubic hair on one of the models had not been properly masked. Ito feared he would be penalized, even banned from further publication of Barazoku, but received only a warning that no pubic hair would appear in future issues. Ito continued to publish Barazoku bi-monthly, with increasing sales.

In 1973, Barazoku salvaged a short story &quot;Ai no Shokei&quot; (&quot;Worse for Love&quot;) by Tamotsu Sakakiyama from the 1960s members-only gay magazine &quot;Apollo&quot;. Since first appearing in 1960, the story had been rumored to be written by renowned author Yukio Mishima for its similarities with Mishima&#x27;s 1960 short story &quot;Yukoku&quot; (&quot;Patriotism&quot;). Barazoku invited regular contributors along with university professor Masamichi Abe and film critic Tatsuji Okawa to participate in a debate over the rumor&#x27;s veracity. Abe admitted that there were similarities between &quot;Ai no Shokei&quot; and &quot;Yukoku,&quot; but did not contend that both works were written by Mishima. On the other hand, &quot;Barazoku&quot;&#x27;s editor Ryu Fujita and novelist Mansaku Arashi both insisted that &quot;Ai no Shokei&quot; had been written by Mishima under a pseudonym. In 2005, 32 years after the discussion, it was determined that Fujita and Arashi were correct.

Starting in 1974, Ito began publishing &quot;Barazoku&quot; monthly in order to compete with &quot;Adon&quot;, a new gay magazine launched by Sadashiro Minami, a former writer for &quot;Barazoku&quot;. Monthly publication of &quot;Barazoku&quot; was welcomed by readers and circulation increased. In 1975, however, a serially-published erotic novel &quot;Danshoku Saiyuki&quot; (Gay Journey to the West), which began with the April issue, was found to be obscene. This time Ito and the novel&#x27;s author Mansaku Arashi were summoned and interrogated harshly, until the investigators discovered that Arashi was related to a former Japanese prime minister. The investigation was closed and Ito and Arashi were not criminalized, but further sale of the April 1975 issue was forbidden.

In 1976, Ito opened a cafe named &quot;Matsuri&quot; (Carnival) in Shinjuku as a social space for &quot;Barazoku&quot;″s readers. Ito thought that not many visitors would dare to be seen as gay, but the cafe instantly became very popular, and Ito needed to open multiple locations when the first Matsuri was unable to handle all the visitors. Another cafe, &quot;Ribonnu&quot; (Ribbon Girl), was opened for lesbian clientele in the same district.

By the end of the 1970s, &quot;Barazoku&quot; became much thicker in volume with more articles and photographs, and the price went up to 500 yen. The price increase was welcomed by readers who did not want to be seen when buying the gay magazine, as they did not have to wait for change if they give a 500-yen note.

===1980s: rise of Bara products and AIDS===
In 1981, &quot;Barazoku&quot; began selling gay videos, which turned out to be another success. Ito stated that although purchasing such videos via mail-order had been considered unsafe, many people placed orders as they trusted &quot;Barazoku&quot;&#x27;s reputation. One of the pilot titles &quot;Bara to Umi to Taiyo to&quot; (Roses, the Sea and the Sun) became popular and was later shown in movie theaters with the catchphrase &quot;Barazoku Eiga (movie)&quot;. Since then, male gay movies in Japan have all been labeled as &quot;Barazoku Eiga&quot;, regardless of who produced them.

In 1982, Ito produced a lubricant product named &quot;Love Oil&quot;. He appealed to the readers that for safer and better sex, they should use condoms and put Love Oil over it. It became another popular product, with average sales of 4,000–5,000 bottles a month.

In 1985, &quot;Barazoku&quot; staff arranged to interview an AIDS patient. It was the first interview between a Japanese AIDS patient and a member of the media.

&quot;Barazoku&quot; also published extra issues featuring gay manga, including the now-famous works of Junichi Yamakawa, such as &quot;Kuso Miso Technique&quot; (1987). However, Yamakawa&#x27;s style was disliked by the editors except for Ito himself. Eventually Yamakawa stopped visiting Ito and still had not been in contact since then.

<text>Paul Spaeth is an independent musician and composer from the United States. He attended Slinger High School in Slinger, Wisconsin. He started his career at 15 after winning the Pepsi-Summerfest Talent Search contest. While in high school, his CD &quot;Cobalt Blue&quot; reached over 1.6 million downloads at MP3.com and he was recognized as the Top Artist in Los Angeles. Since then, his career has been varied with music for piano, television, film, and video games. He has personally called his music &quot;Cinematic Piano&quot; or &quot;Visual Progressive Instrumental,&quot; to describe his highly melodic and textural styles, but his piano music is often categorized as New Age.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Spaeth grew up in a family where no member was a musician nor an artist. When was three years old, his father took him to a Toys-R-Us and told him he could pick any toy in the store. He chose a yellow dinosaur-shaped toy piano, which planted the seed for his father to place him in piano lessons.
In a move that would later enhance his composer&#x27;s ear, his father placed him in Suzuki piano lessons, a method known for teaching children to play an instrument by listening to recordings as opposed to simply written music, when he was five . Spaeth later said he was so eager to get started after his first lesson that he listened to the lesson tapes repeatedly, late into the night. The next morning, his father woke up to the sound of music playing in the other room and found a young Paul sitting down, already playing the music he had listened to the night before. 
As he continued lessons, his ability to improvise grew. When he was nine, Spaeth&#x27;s grandfather discovered him improvising new compositions on the piano and decided to record them, telling him that he would be on the radio someday. Spaeth has attributed that experience to beginning his desire to become a recording artist. From age 13 through 17, he won several state-wide composition competitions by the Wisconsin School Music Association and Department of Public Instruction, including winning both first and second place awards for two of his pieces in the same year. At age 15, he attended a college-level jazz composition course in Shell Lake, Wisconsin with the late jazz arranger Frank Mantooth, who encouraged him to attend the University of Southern California to study film music.
At age 17, he attended the National High School Music Institute at Northwestern University. The five-week course of university-level training in music and composition allowed Spaeth the opportunity to work with a full orchestra of his peers from around the world. Utilizing this opportunity, he wrote his first piece for full orchestra and piano, &quot;Tragoedia,&quot; a one-movement piano concerto that he performed along with the NHSMI orchestra as the finale in the last concert of the program. At age 18, he entered the composition and film scoring programs at the University of Southern California. During this time, he won numerous awards based on his work, including the 2003 Recording Academy&#x27;s Grammy Scholarship Award, the Frank Wildhorn Composition Award, the Harry Warren Film Scoring Award, and First Prize in USC&#x27;s Symposium for the Arts.

=== Career beginnings ===
Between the years 1997–2001, when he was in high school, Spaeth created New Age piano and orchestral pieces that would later become his first self-produced album, Cobalt Blue. He posted the tracks on the independent music website MP3.com and ultimately received 1.6 million downloads and accolades such as the Top Artist in Los Angeles. When he was 15, he won the Pepsi-Summerfest Talent Search at age 15 as a solo pianist competing against rock, rap, and jazz groups. Before he attended the University of Southern California for film music, he attracted the attention of Lawrence David Foldes, the youngest director to ever be on the board of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. He solicited Spaeth to be the &quot;hands&quot; of an actor playing piano on screen, and arrange music for his film Finding Home. This was Spaeth&#x27;s first appearance in film.

After graduating from the Thornton School of Music, Spaeth concentrated on his scoring career and worked for film composer Christopher Young, doing score preparation and additional orchestrations on films such as Lucky You and Ghost Rider. In 2007, he began working freelance, scoring his first video game for White Moon Dreams. He has also written scores to many other television and film projects, including a documentary &quot;Holy Man: The USA v Douglas White” narrated by Martin Sheen. His projects have premiered at film festivals such as Toronto, Boston, Naples, and Montreal.

=== Redemption (2010–present) ===
Since 2003, Spaeth had been working intermittently on a new piano album, which would be entitled Redemption. A decade in the making, he has often indicated it was a very personal, coming-of-age project for him. Currently, a release is planned for early 2013.

<text>The premier of Alberta is the head of government and first minister of the Canadian province of Alberta. The current premier is Danielle Smith, leader of the governing United Conservative Party, who was sworn in on October 11, 2022.

The premier of Alberta is the leader of the legislative majority in the Alberta Legislature. The premier selects ministers of the Crown to the Executive Council of Alberta (the &quot;cabinet&quot;) and as such is the head of the government in Alberta. The premier is the first minister representing Alberta towards the federal government and the other provinces and territories in Canada.

By constitutional convention the premier is normally a Member of the Legislative Assembly.

==Duties and functions==
To be effective, accountable and in line with custom, the premier is expected to hold a seat in the legislature, so the premier serves as the MLA for a riding and is elected as MLA by the constituents of that constituency. As with most government leaders in a parliamentary system, the premier usually wins his or her own election as MLA easily. However, on occasion, a premier has not been re-elected to their seat in a general election, forcing them to run in a by-election in a constituency that comes empty by the resignation of the sitting MLA or other incident. The most recent case of this was Don Getty, who lost his Edmonton-Whitemud seat in the 1989 election and then ran and was elected in a by-election in Stettler. In 2022 Danielle Smith was elected party leader without holding a seat in the legislative assembly, thus becoming premier, and within a few weeks won a seat in a by-election.

<text>The premier of Manitoba () is the first minister (i.e., head of government or chief executive) for the Canadian province of Manitoba—as well as the &quot;de facto&quot; President of the province&#x27;s Executive Council.

In formal terms, the premier receives a commission to form a government from the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who represents the monarch at the provincial level.

The 25th and current premier of Manitoba is Wab Kinew, who was sworn in on October 18, 2023.

==Status and role==
The premier of Manitoba is the head of the government, in that they are the head of the provincial party capable of winning a vote of confidence in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. In this sense, the role of the premier is the same as the prime minister, but at the provincial level.

After being sworn in, the premier organises a provincial cabinet (the Executive Council), which is formally appointed by the lieutenant governor (lg). Together, the premier and lieutenant governor are comparable to U.S. state governors: the lieutenant governor performs functions of state and protocol, such as signing bills into law, as the King&#x27;s representative to the province; while the premier is responsible for overseeing the operations of government as head of the cabinet.

The premier also represents the province on a national level, and has talks with other premiers and the Prime Minister once a year.

==Premiers of Manitoba==
=== History ===
The Province of Manitoba was created on 12 May 1870 with the passing of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. The next month, on July 15, the Province was officially admitted into Confederation. On December 30 that year, the first election was held for the Manitoba&#x27;s Legislative Assembly.

From 1870 to 1874, Manitoba was governed by its first two Lieutenant Governors (LG), Adams Archibald and Alexander Morris. As agents of the LGs, Alfred Boyd (1870–71) and Henry James Clark (1872–74), who are often named in various lists as the first Manitoba premiers, never actually held the title of &quot;Premier.&quot; Accordingly, there has been debate as to whether the Office of Premier can be considered to have existed before Marc-Amable Girard&#x27;s premiership that began in July 1874. Lieutenant Governor Morris recognized Girard as such in the following correspondence to the Secretary of State in Ottawa:

Additionally, Wab Kinew, Leader of Manitoba&#x27;s New Democratic Party (NDP), introduced a bill in 2020 to formally recognize the founder of Manitoba, Louis Riel, as the province&#x27;s first premier. While this private member&#x27;s bill (bill 206 of the 42nd legislature) was defeated, Wab later passed the bill in 2023 when he became Premier (bill 2 of the 43rd legislature).

Until 1888, the administrations of Manitoba were non-partisan. That year, Thomas Greenway would become the first partisan and first Liberal premier of Manitoba, followed by Conservative Hugh John Macdonald. Progressivism would finally make its way to Manitoba&#x27;s government in 1922, under the non-partisan United Farmers leader John Bracken, who held office for 20 years under various political and non-partisan labels.

Since the 1950s, Manitoba has alternated between governments led by the New Democrats (and predecessors) and by the Progressive Conservatives (PC; and predecessors). Moreover, throughout the province&#x27;s history, all but one of its governments—Premier Sterling Lyon (1977–81)—have been elected to second terms.

In 2016, long-time conservative politician Brian Pallister became the 22nd premier of Manitoba, upending 17 years of NDP governance in the province. Pallister&#x27;s landslide victory would follow the premiership of NDP Greg Selinger (2009–16), who &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; says has been regarded as Canada&#x27;s &quot;least popular premier.&quot; Following his election, according to the Angus Reid Institute, Pallister was the 2nd-most-popular premier in the country; however, his popularity would steadily decline since (with an approval rating of 37% two years into his mandate).

<text>Judith A. Sgro (born December 16, 1944) is a Canadian politician. A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, she currently represents the electoral district of Humber River—Black Creek in the House of Commons of Canada. Sgro currently serves as the chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade and as a Chair on the Canadian House of Commons Liaison Committee since 2016.

==Politics==

===Councillor===
Sgro was introduced to politics when she was elected to North York City Council in 1987. In 1994 she was acclaimed as a Metro councillor for North York. In 1998 she became a Toronto city councillor in the newly amalgamated city where she served a term as vice-chair of the Toronto Police Services Board.

===Federal politics===

====Government (1999–2006)====
In 1997 Sgro&#x27;s first attempt at Federal politics came up short when she tried to get elected in the riding of York South—Weston. She lost to John Nunziata, who was running as an independent, by 4,431 votes. In 1999 she won a by-election in York West to replace Sergio Marchi who had accepted an ambassadorial position to the World Trade Organization. She has since been re-elected by substantial pluralities.

In 2001, she was named chairperson of the Prime Minister&#x27;s &quot;Caucus Task Force on Urban Issues&quot;. In 2003 her group released an interim report recommending increased Federal support to recognize their economic and social value. From December 12, 2003 to January 13, 2005 Sgro served as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in the government of Paul Martin.

====Political favouritism issues====

In November 2004, controversy began to surround Sgro as questions arose surrounding her activities during the June election earlier that year. Several members of her ministerial staff had filed expense claims to travel to and work in her riding throughout the campaign ending on election day. More serious claims were also raised when Opposition Conservative MPs claimed she had given a special immigration permit to a campaign supporter – specifically Alina Balaican, a Romanian who had initially been admitted to the country to work as a stripper. New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin also accused Sgro&#x27;s aides of making threats to deny ministerial permits to his constituents if he criticized her on the stripper controversy. The press dubbed the issue &quot;Strippergate&quot;.

On January 14, 2005, Sgro resigned from cabinet after further allegations that she had offered to intervene in the immigration hearing of Harjit Singh, a Brampton pizzeria owner, in exchange for free pizza for her campaign staff. The following day, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; revealed that Singh had previously committed credit card fraud.

On January 31, 2005, Sgro filed a lawsuit against Singh for $750,000 in damages. On May 10, 2005, the Federal ethics commissioner Bernard Shapiro cleared Sgro of all wrongdoing from the &quot;Strippergate&quot; debacle when it was found that Sgro didn&#x27;t know that two staffers had put her in a position of conflict of interest. The ethics commissioner also concluded that Sgro had never met the woman or even knew that she had volunteered on her re-election campaign. Shapiro said to Sgro, &quot;It appears you acted appropriately.&quot; Also the same day, Singh retracted his allegations and apologized to Sgro. He said, &quot;I now admit I did not have a meeting with Judy Sgro and at no time did she request any campaign assistance from me. Nor did she help me with my immigration problems.&quot;

Sgro was the first member of Cabinet to resign from Paul Martin&#x27;s government. There was some speculation in the media that fellow minister Joe Volpe helped to engineer her resignation given that they had a cool relationship.

====Expenses issue====
In June 2010 it was revealed that Sgro had been claiming expenses for rent on an Ottawa luxury highrise condominium owned by her adult children, violating rules for such expenses set by the Board of Internal Economy of the House of Commons. Sgro had paid $138,000 to purchase the condo in 2001, and then transferred the title on the property to her children in 2006; she then paid her children $22,000 a year in rent to live in the apartment, violating rules forbidding MPs from claiming expenses on goods or services contracted from family members.

Asked about this controversy in 2013 by a reporter from Québecor Média, Sgro replied, &quot;The issue was dealt with, an issue was pointed out... I immediately dealt with the issue and I would ask the prime minister and his folks to do the same thing. Thank you very much.&quot;

====Opposition (2006–2015)====
Sgro served as the Opposition Critic for Industry for the Liberals. On November 1, 2010, the Liberals released a white paper providing recommendations for retirement income security followed by a Pension Income Bill of Rights. The paper was created by a working group co-chaired by Sgro.

On March 4, 2014, Sgro was re-nominated by acclamation as the Liberal candidate for the renamed riding of Humber River—Black Creek for the next federal election. She subsequently won election to this seat.

====Government (2015–present)====
Sgro currently serves as the chair of the Standing Committee on International Trade. She was re-elected in the 2019 federal election.

==Personal life==
She and her husband Sam Sgro are the parents of three children. Judy&#x27;s daughter, Deanna Sgro, was a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party during the 2018 Ontario general election, as well as the 2018 Toronto municipal election for Humber River-Black Creek.

<doc id="470564" wikidata="Q1141722" url="?curid=470564" title="Little Cayman">
<text>Little Cayman is one of three Islands that make up the Cayman Islands. It is located in the Caribbean Sea, approximately 60 miles (96 km) northeast of East End, Grand Cayman and five miles (8 km) west of West End, Cayman Brac. Little Cayman is the least populous island of the three, with a permanent population of about 160 (2021) including seasonal residents/homeowners. The majority of the population are expatriate workers from Jamaica, the Philippines, and Honduras and from other Latin American countries as well as Canada, the USA, India, Australia, Scotland, England, and South Africa. There are a handful of local Caymanians estimated as fewer than 20. It is about 10 miles (16 km) long with an average width of 1 mile (1600 m) and most of the island is undeveloped. Almost the entire island is at sea level. The highest elevation is about 40 feet (12 metres). The rainy season, which consists of mostly light showers, occurs in Mid-April until June and again in mid-September to mid-October. There will be occasional quick rain showers in the early morning hours. The coolest months are from End of November until Mid March as the cold fronts coming in from the North which the temperature can drop into the low&#x27;70s. The Hottest and dryest months are in Summer starting mid-June to mid-September with temperatures between the mid-80s and high 90s. There are no large or predatory or venomous animals that pose a threat to humans. 

Despite its small size, the island hosts a heritage festival and parade as part of Pirates Week, (November) and the annual LC Agriculture Show (May) which also occurs on all three Islands, but at different dates in that same month.

==History==

The first recorded sighting of Little Cayman, along with Cayman Brac, was by Christopher Columbus on May 10, 1503, on his fourth and final voyage, when heavy winds forced his ship off course. Columbus had found the two smaller sister islands (Cayman Brac and Little Cayman) and it was these two islands that he named &quot;Las Tortugas&quot;

The first settlement on the Island was in the 17th century when turtle fishermen set up camps that would supply pirate and military ship convoys with fresh meat (turtles, penned pigs, goats, poultry) and freshwater. There are freshwater springs that run underground in cavernous veins. After a raid by a Spanish privateer, these settlements were abandoned in 1671. The island was not resettled until 1833, when the second recorded settlement of &quot;Blossom Village&quot; was established by a few families, mostly with the surname Bawden or Bodden, Scotts, Ryan, and Ritch, who is said to have been part of Cromwell&#x27;s army in Jamaica. By the early 20th century, a few hundred people (400 adults and children) lived on Little Cayman and sustained a living from and exported phosphate ore, coconuts, and marine rope made from the Cayman Islands National tree the Silver Thatch. There were also a few schooners being built by the Bodden family. While the first settlement and harbor were on the northside coastline in the area off of the &quot;Bloody Bay Wall&quot;, Blossom Village was the second settlement in the early 1800s on the southside, on &quot;South Hole Sound&quot;&#x27;, and is where the school, stores, post office, park, and the back sandy road are located today. After the 1932 hurricane which claimed scores of lives on the Brac and Little Cayman, many families decided to move to Cayman Brac. The South Hole Sound waters were also a lot deeper back then.

==Attractions==

=== Scuba Diving ===

Little Cayman is famous for its scuba diving. The most popular dive site areas, Bloody Bay and Jackson&#x27;s Bight, are both located on the north side of the island, just west of its midpoint. The deeper sites on its south side are generally visited on winter days when the north side is too rough. Little Cayman features dive sites as shallow as 20 feet (6.1 m) and its walls are deep enough to be effectively infinite.

Bloody Bay, in particular, is consistently ranked as one of the world&#x27;s top dive sites. Many dive operations claim the late Philippe Cousteau declared its wall to be one of the three best dives in the world, although this story may be fanciful. At its shallowest point, the drop-off begins at a depth of 18 feet (5.5 m), allowing divers who plan carefully to achieve a maximum depth of over 100 feet (30.5 m) but still enjoy exceptionally long dive times. But the wall is so famous primarily because sections of it are so sheer as to be effectively vertical, a rarity.

The most vertical section of the wall (the dive site &quot;Great Wall West&quot;) was immortalized in 1999 by the Bloody Bay Wall Mural Project. A crew of photographers directed by Jim Hellemn photographed the wall piece by piece and the images were compiled into a single, highly detailed image of the entire wall. The photograph was reproduced in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in 2001. In 2010, photographers returned to the same section of the wall in an effort to create a comparison image showing changes over the intervening decade.

The depth of Little Cayman&#x27;s dropoffs is often exaggerated by local divemasters claiming depths of or . In truth, the 1000 m contour (3000+ ft) has been charted to be approximately one mile (1600 m) offshore on Little Cayman&#x27;s Southside, and offshore of Bloody Bay on the island&#x27;s Northside (Ibid), distances far beyond the areas dived by recreational divers.

Little Cayman&#x27;s reefs are exceptionally healthy for a regularly dived area and inhabited by a full range of typical Caribbean reef life, from seahorses to sharks, and including a notable population of green sea turtles, southern and eagle rays.

In 2010, local dive operators launched a concerted effort to eradicate the invasive, non-indigenous red lionfish (&quot;Pterois volitans&quot;), which appears to be limiting its population around Little Cayman. On Wednesday afternoons, divemasters from the various resorts on Little Cayman embark on a hunt for lionfish to cull the species. Since the hunts began, more grey Caribbean reef sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus perezii&quot;) are noticeable on dives. The lionfish are then sent to CCMI for research and after will be given out to restaurants to offer as a daily special.

=== Booby Pond and Rookery(Little Cayman National Trust)===

Little Cayman&#x27;s Booby Pond Nature Reserve supports the largest red-footed booby population in the Caribbean and is a designated Ramsar wetland of international importance. The site encompasses . The Cayman Islands National Trust building on one edge of the pond offers two view decks with telescopes, and the building itself is open for a couple of hours on weekday afternoons. It contains exhibits about Little Cayman&#x27;s flora and fauna as well as souvenirs. There is no entrance fee and donations are gladly accepted.

=== Rock Iguanas and other fauna ===

Little Cayman has the only substantial population (estimated at 2,000) of the critically endangered Lesser Caymans iguana. Predation by feral cats, encroachment by humans into their habitat, and road deaths have reduced their population on Cayman Brac to less than 100. The rock iguanas are easy to spot on Little Cayman and the National Trust unveiled a boardwalk in December 2013 that allows visitors to view one of their nesting areas. There are no Blue Iguanas found on Little Cayman only in Eastern areas on Grand Cayman. There are Iguana warning slow down signs to be cautious in certain areas where they like to sun out on the road. The speed limit on Little Cayman is 25 mph (40 km/h).

Little Cayman also hosts the critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle, and the threatened West Indian whistling duck (&quot;Dendrocygna arborea&quot;), also known as the black-billed whistling duck. The Tarpon Lake, a salt pond near the center of the island, boasts an unusual population of landlocked tarpon, a large silver fish that usually lives only in the ocean.

=== Owen Island ===

&quot;Owen&#x27;s Island&quot; or &quot;The Key&quot; is a small islet off the south-western coast of Little Cayman, approximately 1000 ft (300m) from the nearest point on Little Cayman. Cayman&#x27;s 4th island is rumoured to be named after a sailor named Owen who was on a ship named the &quot;Sparrow Hawk&quot; which anchored nearby multiple times and he always would visit the key declaring that it was his personal private island. The islet features no buildings, homes, or human habitation, and is a popular day trip for families, honeymooners and adventurers. On the side nearest to Little Cayman, it has a white shallow sand bar which is suitable for children, swimming, and snorkeling. Owen&#x27;s Island is privately owned and the owners allow public use with the expectation in respect &amp; maintaining cleanliness when visiting. To visit Owen Island, travelers typically cross South Hole Sound lagoon by small boat (or by water taxi) from a nearby Little Cayman resort. On calm days, some may opt to use a kayak or standup paddleboard (available for rent at some resorts) and a few have even been known to swim/wade/snorkel the 300m out from the nearest point.

=== Point of Sand ===

Little Cayman has many rocky beaches suitable for walking or entry points for shore diving and snorkeling. But the island has only one truly fine swimming beach with an expanse of sand, a clean, sandy bottom, and a protective reef line: Point of Sand. Currents are often very strong, but the shallowest areas are suitable for careful wading even by nonswimmers. Point of Sand is located on the northeastern tip of Little Cayman and boasts a clear view of the West end of Cayman Brac five miles away. Indeed, the beach is sufficiently lovely that it attracts visitors from Cayman Brac who come over on boats. Sundays, in particular, find many local families using the beach, which is likely to be deserted on weekdays. The beach has a shelter with picnic tables and a barbecue, but no services of any kind and no water. Getting there requires a mini-bus service, rented car, or scooter; the determined and physically fit can get there on a bicycle.

=== Little Cayman Museum ===
A small collection focusing on local history is open for a few hours, usually weekday afternoons. There is no admission fee so donations after are appreciated and there is Tanya who has extensive knowledge of Rock Iguanas, bird life and she will happily educate and show you some of their burrows located behind the old museum.

===Little Cayman Research Centre(Central Caribbean Marine Institute)===

This 6,600 square foot research center is located on the north side of Little Cayman and is a part of the Central Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI). CCMI is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1998 to protect the future of coral reefs through research, conservation, and education. Contact the staff there to schedule a very informative tour of the facility.

==Accessibility and Services==

Little Cayman is accessible by air (via Cayman Airways) via daily inter-island flights from both Cayman Brac and Grand Cayman. Its only airport, Edward Bodden Airfield is on the southwest tip of the island. Little Cayman is not an entry point to the country; visitors and residents must land first on Grand Cayman (Owen Roberts International Airport) or Cayman Brac (Charles Kirkconnell International Airport) which are international airports. Sea vessels must also call into port with CBC (Immigration and Customs) either on Grand Cayman or Cayman Brac only if planning to anchor off any of the designated moorings on the North and South coasts of Little Cayman. Many moorings are for the use of the dive boats only and a maximum of four hours. 

Little Cayman has one grocery-and-hardware store, one online grocery delivery store, one liquor store, one bank (CNB opens on Mondays and Thursdays) a 24hr ATM with CI$ and US$ cash, three full-service restaurants, and one local food delivery service, two churches, two-car rental operations, and also an 11 seater mini-bus with transport/taxi service which offers pick up and drop off to beaches, bars, restaurants, and the airport as well as land tours and food delivery.

There are four small souvenir/resort wear shops. It is served by the Edward Bodden Airfield, a two-man police force, a five-man fire crew with one truck and rescue boat, a full-time postmaster, a power station operated by Cayman Brac Power and Light, a clinic staffed by two nurses, and a one-room school whose enrollment is usually in single digits. Cellular phone service offered by LIME and Digicel has almost completely eliminated reliance on landlines, which many residents maintain primarily to allow them to connect to the Internet, which can only be accessed by ADSL. There are certain areas on the North East side that get no reception. The water is safe to drink as all resorts have reverse osmosis desalination for drinking, bathing, and cooking. Cistern or spring water is used for other dwellings and buildings. There is no shortage of potable drinking water. There is a weekly food supply by sea or air, electricity (110V), fuel (gas CI$6.05 and diesel at CI$6.11 an imperial gallon), and propane gas.

Little Cayman Education Services is the sole educational provider on the island.

<doc id="470565" wikidata="Q6578215" url="?curid=470565" title="Premier of Saskatchewan">
<text>The premier of Saskatchewan is the first minister and head of government for the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The current premier of Saskatchewan is Scott Moe, who was sworn in as premier on February 2, 2018, after winning the 2018 Saskatchewan Party leadership election. The first premier of Saskatchewan was Liberal Thomas Walter Scott, who served from 1905 to 1916. Since Saskatchewan was created as a province in 1905, 15 individuals have served as premier.

==Legal status==
Although the premier is the day-to-day leader of the provincial government, they receive the authority to govern from the Crown, represented in Saskatchewan by the lieutenant governor. Formally, the executive branch of government in Saskatchewan is said to be vested in the lieutenant governor acting by and with the advice of the premier. The executive branch of the Saskatchewan government consists of the premier, the lieutenant governor, the Cabinet and the Public Service.

The political party that wins the largest number of seats in a general election is usually invited by the lieutenant governor to form the government. The governing party&#x27;s leader becomes the head of the provincial government and is known as the premier. The position of premier is not described in Canadian constitutional statutes. Instead, the position’s power and authority largely depend on their relationship with other members of the Legislative Assembly, political party, and the public.

==Formal responsibilities==
The premier&#x27;s responsibilities are varied. They serve as president of the Executive Council and head of the provincial Cabinet. The Executive Council is the formal name of the Cabinet when it is acting in its legal capacity, as well as the head of the provincial government. The premier is a leader concerning the development and implementation of government policies, as well as communicating and coordinating priorities within the province as well as within the country. In addition to the political duties with the province of Saskatchewan, the premier is also the leader of one of the province&#x27;s main political parties and represents their constituency in the Legislative Assembly.

<text>The hood (American English) or bonnet (Commonwealth English) is the hinged cover over the engine of motor vehicles. Hoods can open to allow access to the engine compartment, or trunk (boot in Commonwealth English) on rear-engine and some mid-engine vehicles) for maintenance and repair.

==Terminology==

In British terminology, &quot;hood&quot; refers to a fabric cover over the passenger compartment of the car (known as the &#x27;roof&#x27; or &#x27;top&#x27; in the US). In many motor vehicles built in the 1930s and 1940s, the resemblance to an actual hood or bonnet is clear when open and viewed head-on. In modern vehicles it continues to serve the same purpose but no longer resembles a head covering.

==Styles and materials==
On front-engined cars, the hood may be hinged at either the front or the rear edge, or in earlier models (e.g. the Ford Model T) it may be split into two sections, one each side, each hinged along the centre line. Another variant combines the bonnet and wheelarches into one section which allows the entire front bodywork to tilt forwards around a pivot near the front of the vehicle (e.g. that of the Triumph Herald).

Hoods are typically made of the same material as the rest of the body work. This may include steel, aluminium, fiberglass or carbon fiber. Some aftermarket companies produce replacements for steel hoods in fiberglass or carbon fiber to reduce vehicle weight.

==Release/ safety and security mechanisms==
The hood release system is common on most vehicles and usually consists of an interior hood latch handle, hood release cable and hood latch assembly. The hood latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver&#x27;s seat or set into the door frame. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. Some aftermarket hoods that have a latch system are still equipped with hood pins to hold the hood buttoned down if the latch fails.

==Features==

A hood may contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, and/or wiper jets. A portion of the hood may be raised in a power bulge, to fit a large engine or air filters.

==Pedestrian safety==
In Japan and Europe, regulations have come into effect that place a limit on the severity of pedestrian head injury when struck by a motor vehicle. This is leading to more advanced hood designs, as evidenced by multicone hood inner panel designs as found on the Mazda RX-8 and other vehicles. Other changes are being made to use the hood as an active structure and push its surface several centimeters away from the hard motor components during a pedestrian crash. This may be achieved by mechanical (spring force) or pyrotechnic devices.

<text>Franklin Ramon Chang-Díaz (born April 5, 1950, San José, Costa Rica) is a Costa Rican-American mechanical engineer, physicist, and former NASA astronaut. He is the sole founder and CEO of Ad Astra Rocket Company as well as a member of the Cummins&#x27; board of directors. He became an American citizen in 1977.

He is a veteran of seven Space Shuttle missions, tying the record, as of 2021 for the most spaceflights (a record set two months earlier by Jerry L. Ross). He was the third Latin American, and the first Latin American immigrant NASA astronaut selected to go into space. Chang-Díaz is a member of NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Hall of Fame.

== Family and education ==
Franklin Ramón Chang-Díaz was born in San José, Costa Rica on April 5, 1950, to Ramón Ángel Chang Morales, an oil worker whose own father fled from China during the Boxer Rebellion, and María Eugenia Díaz. One of six children, he has a younger sister, Sonia Rosa (born December 1952) and his mother, brothers and sisters still reside in Costa Rica. His two eldest daughters with his ex-wife Candice Chang, include Sonia Rosa, who is a member of the Massachusetts Senate. He married Dr. Peggy Marguerite Doncaster (&quot;née&quot; Stafford, of Alexandria, Louisiana), in the United States, on December 17, 1984. They have two daughters, both born in Houston, Texas.

He graduated from Colegio de La Salle in San Jose with an &quot;A&quot; grade in November 1967, then moved to the United States to finish his high school education at Hartford Public High School in Connecticut, in 1969. He went on to attend the University of Connecticut, where he earned a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and joined the federal TRIO Student Support Services program in 1973. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned a Ph.D. degree in applied plasma physics in 1977. For his graduate research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Chang-Díaz worked in the field of fusion technology and plasma-based rocket propulsion. Post-graduation from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1979, Chang-Díaz was responsible for developing a novel technique that used an inertial fusion reactor chamber to accurately align fuel pellets to collide with one another in order to create a fusion event. 

== NASA career ==
Chang-Díaz was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1980, and first flew aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-61-C in 1986. Subsequent missions included STS-34 (1989), STS-46 (1992), STS-60 (1994), STS-75 (1996), STS-91 (1998), and STS-111 (2002). During STS-111, he performed three extravehicular activities (EVAs) with Philippe Perrin as part of the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). He was also director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center from 1993 to 2005. Chang-Díaz retired from NASA in 2005.

== Post-NASA career ==
After leaving NASA, Chang-Díaz set up the Ad Astra Rocket Company, which became dedicated to the development of advanced plasma rocket propulsion technology. Years of research and development have produced the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR), an electrical propulsion device for use in space. With a flexible mode of operation, the rocket can achieve very high exhaust speeds, and with a sufficiently powerful electrical supply even has the theoretical capability to take a crewed rocket to Mars in 39 days.

Chang-Díaz also is active in environmental protection and raising awareness about climate change, notably in his role in Odyssey 2050 The Movie in which he encourages young people to get motivated about environmental issues.

In addition, he is an adjunct professor in physics and astronomy at Rice University. He has been on the board of directors of Cummins since December 8, 2009.

He is also the father of Democratic candidate for the 2022 Massachusetts gubernatorial election Sonia Chang-Díaz.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1986, Franklin Chang-Díaz was one of twelve recipients of the Medal of Liberty. He was inducted into the NASA Astronaut Hall of Fame on May 5, 2012 in a ceremony that took place in the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Also, due to his career and scientific success, he has been decorated multiple times in Costa Rica and named Honor Citizen by the national legislature. The Costa Rican National High Technology Center (CeNAT), among other institutions, is named after him. In 2014, Chang-Díaz was awarded the &quot;Buzz Aldrin Quadrennial Space Award&quot; by The Explorers Club. Buzz Aldrin, whom Chang-Díaz called a childhood hero, presented the award.

<text>Peggy Annette Whitson (born February 9, 1960) is an American biochemistry researcher, and astronaut working for Axiom Space. She retired from NASA in 2018, after serving as Chief Astronaut. Over all her missions, Whitson accumulated a total of 675 days in space, more than any other American or woman. 

Her first NASA space mission was in 2002: an extended stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as a crew member of Expedition 5. On her second mission, Expedition 16 in 2007-2008, she became the first woman to command the ISS. In 2009, she became the first woman to serve as NASA&#x27;s Chief Astronaut, the most senior position in the NASA Astronaut Corps. In 2017, Whitson became the first woman to command the International Space Station twice. Her 289-day flight was the longest single space flight by a woman until Christina Koch&#x27;s 328-day flight.

Whitson holds the records for the oldest woman spacewalker and the most spacewalks by a woman. Whitson&#x27;s cumulative EVA time is 60 hours, 21 minutes, which places her in fifth place for total EVA time. At age 57 on her final NASA flight, she was the oldest woman ever in space at that time - a record broken in a 2021 sub-orbital flight by Wally Funk. She is still the oldest woman to orbit the Earth, a record she broke in 2023, at 63.

On June 15, 2018, Whitson retired from NASA. She later became a consultant for Axiom Space and is the commander of Axiom Mission 2 and will be the commander of Axiom Mission 4.

Whitson was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People of 2018.&quot;

==Early life and background==
Whitson grew up on a farm outside the town of Beaconsfield, Iowa, with her sister, Kathy, her brothers, Brian and Hugh, and her parents, Keith and Beth. Her parents were farmers. She decided to become an astronaut after she watched the first Moon landing on television as a child in 1969. Whitson graduated from Mount Ayr Community High School in 1978 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and chemistry from Iowa Wesleyan College in 1981. She then went on to earn her doctorate degree in biochemistry from Rice University in 1986 under the direction of Kathleen Matthews, then continued at Rice as a Robert A Welch Post-doctoral Fellow until October 1986. She is married to Clarence F. Sams.

==Research career==
After her fellowship at Rice, she began working at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as a National Research Council Resident Research Associate. From April 1988 until September 1989, Whitson served as the Supervisor for the Biochemistry Research Group at KRUG International, a medical sciences contractor at NASA-JSC.

From 1991 through 1997, Whitson became an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and the Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. In 1997, Whitson began teaching as adjunct assistant professor at Rice University in the Maybee Laboratory for Biochemical and Genetic Engineering.

From 1992 to 1995, she served as project scientist for the Shuttle-Mir Program, then until 1996, as deputy division chief for the Medical Sciences division at the Johnson Space Center.

==NASA career==

From 1989 to 1993, Whitson worked as a research biochemist in the Biomedical Operations and Research Branch at NASA-JSC. From 1991 to 1993, she served as technical monitor of the Biochemistry Research Laboratories in the Biomedical Operations and Research Branch. From 1991 through 1992, she was the payload element developer for Bone Cell Research Experiment (E10) aboard SL-J (STS-47), and was a member of the US-USSR Joint Working Group in Space Medicine and Biology. In 1992, she was named the project scientist of the Shuttle-Mir Program (STS-60, STS-63, STS-71, Mir 18, Mir 19), and served in this capacity until the conclusion of the Phase 1A Program in 1995. From 1993 through 1996, Whitson held the additional responsibilities of the deputy division chief of the Medical Sciences Division at NASA-JSC. From 1995 to 1996, she served as co-chair of the U.S.-Russian Mission Science Working Group.

In April 1996, Whitson was selected as an astronaut candidate; she started training in August 1996. Upon completing the two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Operations Planning Branch, and served as the lead for the Crew Test Support Team in Russia from 1998 to 1999. In June 2003, Whitson commanded the NEEMO 5 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for 14 days. From November 2003 to March 2005, she served as deputy chief of the Astronaut Office. From March 2005 to November 2005, she served as chief of the Station Operations Branch, Astronaut Office.

===Chief of the Astronaut Office===
Whitson was appointed NASA Chief of the Astronaut Office in October 2009, replacing Steven W. Lindsey. Whitson was the first female, and first non-pilot to serve as Chief Astronaut. She resigned when she went back on active flight status in July 2012, replaced by Robert Behnken. Whitson has also served twice as the commander of the International Space Station.

== Involvement with Axiom Space ==
She is the Director of Human Space Flight for Axiom Space.
In January 2021 it was announced that she is back-up commander of Axiom Mission 1, raising the possibility that she could fly a later Axiom Space mission.
=== Commander of Axiom Mission 2 ===
In May 2021, Whitson was confirmed as commander of the second Axiom mission Axiom Mission 2.

She was again back-up commander of Axiom Mission 3.
=== Commander of Axiom Mission 4 ===
In April 2024, Whitson was confirmed as commander of the fourth Axiom mission Axiom Mission 4.

==Spaceflight experience==
===Expedition 5===
The Expedition 5 crew launched on June 5, 2002, aboard STS-111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. During her six-month stay aboard the Space Station, Whitson installed the Mobile Base System, the S1 truss segment, and the P1 truss segment using the space station remote manipulator system; performed a 4-hour and 25 minute spacewalk in a Russian Orlan space suit to install micrometeoroid shielding on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module; and activated and checked out the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox, a facility class payload rack.

Whitson was named the first NASA science officer during her stay, and she conducted 21 investigations in human life sciences and microgravity sciences, as well as commercial payloads. The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-113 on December 7, 2002. Completing her first flight, Whitson logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space.

===Expedition 16===
Her second mission, Expedition 16, launched October 10, 2007, on Soyuz TMA-11. Along with her Expedition 16 crew member Yuri Malenchenko and spaceflight participant Yi So-yeon, she returned to Earth in Soyuz TMA-11 on April 19, 2008. The re-entry was remarkable for the failure of the Soyuz propulsion module to separate properly, and the subsequent &quot;ballistic reentry&quot; which subjected the crew to forces about eight times that of Earth surface gravity. She spent 191 days, 19 hrs and 8 mins in space on this mission.

On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16 to inspect the S4 starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), the ground team in Mission Control informed Whitson that she had become the female astronaut with the most cumulative EVA time in NASA history, as well as the most EVAs, with her fifth EVA. Three hours and 37 minutes into the spacewalk, Whitson surpassed NASA astronaut Sunita Williams with a total time at that point of 29 hours and 18 minutes. At the completion of Whitson&#x27;s fifth EVA, the 100th in support of ISS assembly and maintenance, Whitson&#x27;s cumulative EVA time became 32 hours, and 36 minutes, which placed her in 20th place for total EVA time. Her sixth spacewalk, also during Expedition 16, brought her cumulative EVA time to 39 hours, 46 minutes, which ranked her 23rd for total EVA time as of November 2009.

===Expedition 50/51/52===
Peggy Whitson arrived at the International Space Station on November 19, 2016, on Soyuz MS-03, which was launched on November 17, 2016, from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. She became the commander of Expedition 51. With the launch of Expedition 50/51 with her on it, Whitson, at age 56, became the oldest woman to fly into space. During the mission, she broke the record for cumulative time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut, surpassing the previous record of 534 days set by Jeff Williams. In early April 2017, her mission was extended by an additional 3 months at the International Space Station. On September 3, she returned in a previously vacant seat on the Soyuz capsule accompanied by NASA&#x27;s Jack Fischer and Fyodor Yurchikhin of Roscosmos.


In January 2017, Whitson performed her seventh EVA. along with Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough. During the EVA, they installed three new adapter plates and hooked up electrical connectors preparing the way to replace the ISS batteries. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 32 minutes. Whitson now holds the record for the oldest female spacewalker, and is now tied with the record for total spacewalks by a woman (seven), along with Sunita Williams. After completion of the seventh EVA, Whitson&#x27;s cumulative EVA time became 46 hours, 18 minutes, which placed her in 13th place for total EVA time.

On April 24, 2017, Whitson officially broke the record for longest amount of time spent in space by any NASA astronaut. As a result, she received a televised phone call from the Oval Office from US President Donald Trump, the President&#x27;s daughter Ivanka, and fellow astronaut Kathleen Rubins. When interviewed on that day she declared &#x27;It is actually a huge honor to break a record like this, but it is an honor for me back to be representing all the folks at NASA&#x27;.

On May 12, 2017, Whitson performed her ninth career EVA with Jack Fischer. After a short delay due to leaking equipment, they replaced an avionics box on the starboard truss called an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC), a storage platform. The duration was 4 hours and 13 minutes, and it was the 200th EVA to be performed on the ISS.

On May 23, 2017, Whitson performed her tenth career EVA with Fischer. They replaced a backup multiplexer-demultiplexer (MDM) unit that had failed on May 20, 2017. The duration was 2 hours and 46 minutes, making Whitson&#x27;s cumulative EVA time more than 60 hours, placing her third on the list for most EVA time.

On June 1, 2017, Whitson passed over the command of the International Space Station to Fyodor Yurchikhin, who was named commander of Expedition 52 until he, Whitson and Jack Fischer returned to Earth aboard Soyuz MS-04 in September 2017.

Whitson returned to Earth on September 3, 2017, after she accrued a total of 665 days in space over the course of her career. This total was more time in space than any other woman worldwide and any other American. As of April 2021 she is ranked ninth on the list of total time spent in space. The duration of her stay in space during expeditions 50/51/52 was 289 days, 5 hours and 1 minute. In June 2020, Whitson was a guest (along with two imposters) on an ABC-TV &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; episode in which Patti LaBelle correctly selected her as the record-holding time in space astronaut.

===Axiom 2===

Axiom 2 lifted off on 21 May 2023 from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, onboard a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket. The mission, which was the second flight of Crew Dragon &quot;Freedom&quot;, docked with the International Space Station a day later.

During the mission, the crew performed public outreach activities along with scientific research, including studies into the effects of microgravity on stem cells and other biological experiments.

After eight days docked to the ISS, Axiom 2 undocked and returned to Earth twelve hours later. &quot;Freedom&quot; splashed down successfully in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida. It was recovered by SpaceX&#x27;s recovery ship &quot;Megan&quot;.
===Axiom 4===

In April 2024 she was confirmed as the commander of Axiom 4, a 16 day mission to the ISS with a crew of four astronauts. The mission is scheduled to launch in April 2025.

<doc id="470582" wikidata="Q1554545" url="?curid=470582" title="The Opening of Misty Beethoven">
<text>The Opening of Misty Beethoven is an American pornographic comedy film released in 1976. It was produced with a relatively high budget and filmed on elaborate locations in Paris, New York City and Rome with a musical score, and owes much to its director Radley Metzger (directing this film as &quot;Henry Paris&quot;). According to author Toni Bentley, &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; is considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984).

==Plot==
An adult erotic take on George Bernard Shaw 1913 play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, and its 1956 musical adaptation &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, the film follows a sexologist who tries transforming a low-skilled prostitute into a goddess of passion. Her instruction includes seducing a gay male art dealer (played by gay porn actor Casey Donovan), pleasing three men at once, pegging a man, and similar sexual conquests. Shaw&#x27;s character of Henry Higgins here becomes the sexologist Dr. Seymour Love, played by Jamie Gillis. Shaw&#x27;s character of Eliza Doolittle here becomes Dolores &quot;Misty&quot; Beethoven, played by Constance Money. Shaw&#x27;s Colonel Pickering here becomes Geraldine Rich, played by Jacqueline Beudant. As events unfold, Misty achieves &quot;elevation&quot; better than Love and Rich had hoped, and then cuts them off. Misty returns however, running the &quot;school&quot; and taking over for Dr. Love, leaving him in a very subservient position.

==Cast==
* Constance Money as Misty Beethoven
* Jamie Gillis as Dr. Seymour Love
* Calvin Culver (aka Casey Donovan) as Jacque Beudant, art dealer
* Jacqueline Beudant as Geraldine Rich
* Gloria Leonard as Barbara Layman
* Terri Hall as Tanya
* Mark Margolis as unhappy man

==Notes==
The film was released during the Golden Age of Porn (inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol &quot;Blue Movie&quot;) and the phenomenon of &quot;porno chic&quot; in the United States, in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (such as Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (such as Roger Ebert).

In this Golden Age era, most films of the time were expected to have at least minimal plots. &quot;Misty&quot;″s plot was more elaborate than most; it was based directly on George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play, &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, as well as the Broadway and Hollywood success &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Some historians assess &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; as attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets. Author Toni Bentley called the film the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Golden Age. The film is also satirical, with many added comic touches and dialogue designed for laughs. It includes Mark Margolis&#x27;s first role. &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; has the distinction of being the first widely released porn movie to feature female-on-male pegging.

The Italian Edition by Noctuno is an extended version of &quot;Misty Beethoven&quot; with footage not seen in the original film. Some of the extra footage was used in Barbara Broadcast (Misty&#x27;s bondage sequence) and Maraschino Cherry (Misty with the matador). All other cutting room floor footage can be found in the Distribpix &quot;Misty Beethoven&quot; DVD extras. The film was initially rejected for UK cinema by the BBFC and released in a heavily pre-edited form with an additional 1 min 55 secs of censor cuts in 1983. The fully uncut hardcore print was passed with an R18 rating by the BBFC in 2005. It is rumored that the full uncut version was released in the U.S on Laser Disc by Lorimar Home Video. It was also said the Laser Disc Print runs at 87 minutes and has 1:33 ratio. The cool (softcore) version adds several scenes to pad the running time. They include: the servants celebrating at the Italian villa in cave-person outfits, Lawrence and Barbara watching &quot;Kojak&quot; on TV, Misty and Geraldine together in a tub and, last but not least, cigar guy&#x27;s female partner on the plane talking to a dejected Seymour Love.

According to reviewer Steve Gallagher, Radley Metzger&#x27;s films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), are noted for their &quot;lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle&quot;. Claire Simpson noted that his films were &quot;highly artistic — and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography&quot;. Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.

==2012 restoration==
In 2012, DistribPix oversaw a complete restoration of the film, with the full cooperation of the director. The result had a limited exhibition in theaters, but the main outcome of the project was the first-ever official DVD and Blu-ray releases.

==Awards==
Awards from the Adult Film Association of America:
* Best Picture
* Best Director (Radley Metzger as &quot;Henry Paris&quot;)
* Best Actor (Jamie Gillis)
* Best Screenplay (Radley Metzger as &quot;Jake Barnes&quot;)
* Best Editing (Bonnie Karrin)

===Other awards===
* 2002 AVN Award - &quot;Best Classic DVD&quot;
* The film was one of the first to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame.

==Music soundtrack==

During the 2012 restoration of the film, a fully annotated CD soundtrack was released.

==Remake==
In 2004, &quot;Misty Beethoven: The Musical!&quot;, a musical remake, was released. It featured Sunset Thomas, Randy Spears, Julie Meadows, Asia Carrera, Chloe, Dave Cummings, Mike Horner, Evan Stone and Tyce Bune. It was directed by Veronica Hart. The film won the 2004 XRCO Award for &quot;Best Comedy or Parody&quot; and the 2005 AVN Award for &quot;Best Sex Comedy&quot;.

<doc id="470587" wikidata="Q1423130" url="?curid=470587" title="Suzuki SV650">
<text>The Suzuki SV650 and its variants are street motorcycles manufactured since 1999 by Suzuki. In 2009, Suzuki replaced the standard SV650 with the SFV650 Gladius. In 2016, the Gladius name was discontinued and the 2017 model was reverted to SV650.

==First generation (1999–2002)==

Suzuki introduced the SV650 in 1999 as a budget entry in the emerging naked bike market and featured both naked and fully faired versions. The bike provided a sporty though easily manageable ride. The combination of light weight, rigid chassis, strong handling, and the V-twin&#x27;s strong mid-range torque appealed to beginner and experienced riders alike. The 2003 SV1000 was marketed as a bigger alternative to the second generation SV650.

The SV650 immediately became popular, but American buyers wanted the sportier &#x27;S&#x27; version that featured lower handlebars, higher foot pegs and a bikini fairing and windscreen, available only in the European and Canadian markets. American magazines ran articles describing how to import it into the United States. In 2000, Suzuki began importing the SV650S to the USA.

The SV650 with its relatively low purchase price and excellent handling characteristics became popular with racers which prompted a rebirth of the &quot;lightweight twins&quot; racing classes across North America and the SV650 began outselling the Suzuki GS500, Honda NT650 and Kawasaki Ninja 500R, which previously populated the class.

==Second generation (2003–2008)==

In 2003, Suzuki redesigned the SV650 with a new pressure-cast aluminum truss frame, bodywork, swing-arm with revised rear brake caliper mounting, exhaust, digital speedometer display and electronic fuel injection/induction system to replace the carburetor.

The 2003 SV650s also supported some first generation parts (like the rearsets and radiator). The subframe is also angled up higher than 2004+ models. The different subframe has year-specific parts, such as the rider seat, plastic frame covers, exhaust hanger brackets and passenger pegs.

For 2004, Suzuki used a new, 40 mm lower subframe and a seat with a narrower design in the front. This made flat footing easier for shorter riders. The trail was raised by 2 mm, and the rear fender was restyled to clean up the area under the tail lights and provide more protection against flying debris.

In 2005, the color of the frame was changed from silver to a matte black finish and the radiator size was decreased from .

For 2007, both SV650 and SV650S added dual spark plugs per cylinder, and an exhaust gas oxygen sensor on California models for reduced emissions. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also added as an option.

For 2008, alongside the traditional SV650 and SV650S models, Suzuki offered a new SV650 Sport (UK) or SV650SF (US) model with a more traditional complete fairing. The SV650S was removed from the US market.

In September 2008, Suzuki Australia introduced the SV650SU, a de-tuned version of the SV650S, to augment their range of motorcycles that comply with the country&#x27;s Learner Approved Motorcycle Scheme (LAMS).

==Third generation (2009–2013)==

The 2009 Suzuki SFV650 Gladius replaced the SV650 naked version in the USA; however, a naked 2009 SV650 was available in Canada. Although the naked version was superseded by the Gladius, the SV650S model remained in the UK and Australian line-up through to 2012.

==Fourth generation (2017–current)==
The 2017 model released in 2016, SV650/A has returned to the more conventional styling of the pre-Gladius naked version. Suzuki claims the wet weight for the non-ABS model is 195 kg (430 lbs), and 197 kg (434 lbs) for the ABS model. Its engine develops an additional four-horsepower and features a low-speed stalling prevention system (&quot;low RPM assist&quot;) to make the bike more suited to beginners and easier to ride in stop/go traffic. It meets Euro 4 emission regulations. It has a new slim steel frame. Seat height is 785mm (30.9&quot;). Fuel tank capacity is 13.8 litres, or 15.5 litres in the US market. It has twin front disc brakes and new 39mm slimmer and lighter throttle bodies.
In November 2015 Suzuki announced at EICMA 2015 that the SV650 would return in 2016 as a 2017-model year product. Preload adjusters are fitted to 2018 models. A cafe-racer version of the SV650 was launched in 2019 with a front pre-load adjustment.
The photograph shows 2021 model. Yoshimura exhaust used.

== Current market situation ==
Other twin cylinder motorcycles in the class include the Yamaha MT07 / Yamaha XSR700 and Kawasaki Z650 / Kawasaki Ninja 650. The SV650 is more affordable than the likes of the Ducati Monster, Ducati Scrambler, and KTM 790 Duke, but has similar performance.

==History==
It was created by the British North America Act which divided the County of York into two ridings: York East and York West.

The West Riding of York consisted of the Townships of Etobicoke, Vaughan and that part of the Township of York lying west of Yonge Street.

In 1874, it was expanded to include all of the Village of Richmond Hill, which had previously been divided between the two York ridings, after the village council had petitioned to have the whole village included in York West.

The electoral district was abolished in 1903 when York was divided into three ridings. York West was redistributed between the new ridings of York Centre and York South.

The riding was re-created in 1914 from parts of York Centre and York South (federal electoral district)|York South when the county of York, including parts of the city of Toronto, was divided into four ridings: York North, South, East and West. West York was defined to consist of the townships of Vaughan and Etobicoke and the villages of Weston, New Toronto, Mimico and Woodbridge and Ward 7 of the city of Toronto; and the portion of the township of York lying between the western limit of the city of Toronto and the township of Etobicoke bounded on the south by Lake Ontario and on the north by Northland Avenue.

In 1924, it was redefined to consist of the part of the county of York lying west of Yonge Street, south of the south boundary of the township of Vaughan and outside the city of Toronto.

In 1933, it was redefined to consist of the part of the Township of York lying west of a line drawn north from the limits of the city of Toronto along Weston Road and west along Lambton Avenue to the Humber River, the Township of Etobicoke, the towns of Mimico and New Toronto and the villages of Long Branch and Swansea.

In 1952, it was redefined to consist of the town of New Toronto, the village of Long Branch and the part of the township of Etobicoke lying west of a line drawn from the southwest corner of the town of Mimico north along the west boundary of the town of Mimico, east along Queen Elizabeth Way, north along Royal York Road, east along Sunnydale Drive, north along Prince Edward Drive, east along Bloor Street West and Old Mill Road, north along the Humber River, to the northern boundary of the township of Etobicoke.

In 1966, it was redefined to consist of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded by a line drawn from Eglinton Avenue West, north along Jane Street, east along Lawrence Avenue West, north along the C.N.R. line, west along Highway 401, north along Keele Street, west along Calvington Drive, northwest along Exbury Road, north along Jane Street, west along Sheppard Avenue West, north along Highway 400, west along Steeles Avenue West, south along the boundary between the Townships of Etobicoke and Toronto, southeast along the West Branch of the Humber River, south along Kipling Avenue North, east along Rexdale Boulevard, south along Islington Avenue North, east along Dixon Side Road, southeast along the Humber River, and east Eglinton Avenue West to Jane Street.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded on the north by Steeles Avenue West, on the west by the Humber River, and on the south and east by a line drawn from the Humber River east along Lawrence Avenue West, north along Keele Street, west along Sheppard Avenue West, and north along Highway No. 400 to Steeles Avenue West.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the parts of the cities of Etobicoke and North York bounded on the north by Steeles Avenue West, and on the west, south and east by a line drawn from Steeles Avenue south along Martin Grove Road, southeast along Albion Road, north along Kipling Avenue, southeast along Farr Avenue, east to Islington Avenue, north along Islington Avenue, south along the western limit of the City of North York, east along Highway 401, north along Jane Street, east along Grandravine Drive, and north along Black Creek to Steeles Avenue.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of North York bounded on the north and west by the city limits, and on the east and south by a line drawn from Steeles Avenue south along Dufferin Street, west along Sheppard Avenue West, north along Keele Street, west along Grandravine Drive, south along Jane Street, and west along Highway 401 to the western city limit.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above.

<doc id="470605" wikidata="Q184774" url="?curid=470605" title="Red junglefowl">
<text>The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), also known as the Indian red junglefowl (and formerly the bankiva or bankiva-fowl), is a species of tropical, predominantly terrestrial bird in the fowl and pheasant family, Phasianidae, found across much of Southeast and parts of South Asia. The red junglefowl was the primary species to give rise to today&#x27;s many breeds of domesticated chicken (&quot;G. g. domesticus&quot;); additionally, the related grey junglefowl (&quot;G. sonneratii&quot;), Sri Lankan junglefowl (&quot;G. lafayettii&quot;) and the Javanese green junglefowl (&quot;G. varius&quot;) have also contributed genetic material to the gene pool of the modern chicken.

Molecular evidence, derived from whole-genome sequencing, has revealed that the chicken was first domesticated from red junglefowl ca. 8,000 years ago, with this domestication-event involving multiple maternal origins. Since then, the domestic form has spread around the world, and they are bred by humans in their millions for meat, eggs, colourful plumage and companionship. Outside of their native range, mainly in the Americas and Europe, the wild form of &quot;Gallus gallus&quot; is sometimes used in zoos, parks or botanical gardens as a free-ranging form of beneficial &quot;pest control&quot;, similarly to—and often kept with—the Indian blue peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;) or the helmeted guineafowl (&quot;Numida&quot; &quot;meleagris&quot;); hybridisation has been documented between &quot;Gallus&quot; and &quot;Numida&quot;.

== Taxonomy==
The red junglefowl was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Phasianus gallus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;India orientali&quot; but this has been restricted to the island of Pulo Condor Côn Đảo off the coast of Vietnam. The red junglefowl is now one of the four species placed in the genus &quot;Gallus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The word &quot;gallu&quot; is Latin for a farmyard cockerel.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. g. murghi&quot; Robinson &amp; Kloss, 1920 – north India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh
* &quot;G. g. spadiceus&quot; (Bonnaterre, 1792) – northeast India to south China, Malay Peninsula and north Sumatra
* &quot;G. g. jabouillei&quot; Delacour &amp; Kinnear, 1928 – south China to north Vietnam and north Laos
* &quot;G. g. gallus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – south Myanmar through Indochina
* &quot;G. g. bankiva&quot; Temminck, 1813 – Java and Bali

== Description ==
The nominate race of red junglefowl has a mix of feather colours, with orange, brown, red, gold, grey, white, olive, and even metallic green plumage. The tail of the male rooster can grow up to , and the whole bird may be as long as . There are 14 tail feathers. A moult in June changes the bird&#x27;s plumage to an eclipse pattern, which lasts through October. The male eclipse pattern includes a black feather in the middle of the back and small red-orange plumes spread across the body. Female eclipse plumage is generally indistinguishable from the plumage at other seasons, but the moulting schedule is the same as that of males.

Compared to the more familiar domestic chicken, the red junglefowl has a much smaller body mass (around lbs (1 kg) in females and lbs (1.5 kg) in males) and is brighter in coloration. Junglefowl are also behaviourally different from domestic chickens, being naturally very shy of humans compared to the much tamer domesticated subspecies.

===Sexual dimorphism===
Male junglefowl are significantly larger than females and have brightly coloured decorative feathers. The male&#x27;s tail is composed of long, arching feathers that initially look black, but shimmer with blue, purple, and green in direct light. He also has long, golden hackle feathers on his neck and his back. The female&#x27;s plumage is typical of this family of birds in being cryptic and adapted for camouflage. She alone looks after the eggs and chicks. She also has a very small comb and wattles (fleshy ornaments on the head that signal good health to rivals and potential mates) compared to the males.
During their mating season, the male birds announce their presence with the well-known &quot;cock-a-doodle-doo&quot; call or crowing. Within flocks, only dominant males crow. Male red junglefowl have a shorter crowing sound than domestic roosters; the call cuts off abruptly at the end. This serves both to attract potential mates and to make other male birds in the area aware of the risk of fighting a breeding competitor. A spur on the lower leg just behind and above the foot serves in such fighting. Their call structure is complex and they have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators to which others react appropriately.

==Genetics==
===Orthology===
&quot;G. gallus&quot; has three transferrins, all of which cluster closely with other vertebrates&#x27; orthologs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the wild form stretches from India, Nepal and Bangladesh in the west, and eastwards across southern China, to Indochina; south/southeast into Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Junglefowl/Chickens were one of three main animals (along with domesticated pigs and dogs) carried by early Austronesian peoples from Island Southeast Asia in their voyages to the islands of Oceania in prehistory, starting around 5,000 years BP . Today, their modern descendants are found throughout Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia.

Red junglefowl prefer disturbed habitats and edges, both natural and human-created. The forage and thick cover in these sorts of areas are attractive to junglefowl, especially nesting females. Junglefowl use both deforested and regenerating forests, and often are found near human settlements or areas of regrowth from slash-and-burn cultivation. Areas burned to promote bamboo growth also attract junglefowl, with edible bamboo seeds more available. In some areas, red junglefowl are absent from silvicultural and rubber plantations; elsewhere, they will occur in both tea plants and palm oil plantations. In the state of Selangor, Malaysia, palm foliage provides suitable cover; palm nut fruit provides adequate food, as well as insects (and their larvae) within, and adjacent to, the trees.  The palms also offer an array of roost sites, from the low perches (~4 m) favored by females with chicks to the higher perches (up to 12 m) used by other adults.

Red junglefowl drink surface water when it is available, but they do not require it.  Birds in North-Central India visit water holes frequently during the dry season, although not all junglefowl on the subcontinent live close enough to water to do so; population densities may thus be lower, where surface water is limited.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Red junglefowl regularly bathe in dust to keep the right balance of oil in their plumage. The dust absorbs extra oil and subsequently falls off.

Flight in these birds is almost purely confined to reaching their roosting areas at sunset in trees or any other high and relatively safe places free from ground predators, and for escape from immediate danger through the day.

Dominant male junglefowl appear to defend a territory against other dominant males, and the size of the territories has been inferred based on the proximity of roosts. Beebe concluded that territories were rather small, especially as compared to some of the pheasants with which he was familiar. This was supported by Collias and Collias, who reported that adjacent roost sites can be as close as . Within flocks, male red junglefowl exhibit dominance hierarchies, and dominant males tend to have larger combs than subordinate males. Red junglefowl typically live in flocks of one to a few males and several females. Males are more likely to occur alone than females.

=== Breeding ===

Males make a food-related display called &quot;tidbitting&quot;, performed upon finding food in the presence of a female. The display is composed of coaxing, cluck-like calls, and eye-catching bobbing and twitching motions of the head and neck. During the performance, the male repeatedly picks up and drops the food item with his beak. The display usually ends when the hen takes the food item either from the ground or directly from the male&#x27;s beak. Eventually, they sometimes mate.

In many areas, red junglefowl breed during the dry portion of the year, typically winter or spring. This is true in parts of India, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. However, year-round breeding by red junglefowl has been documented in palm oil plantations in Malaysia and also may occur elsewhere. During the laying period, red junglefowl females lay an egg every day. Eggs take 21 days to develop. Chicks fledge in about 4 to 5 weeks, and at 12 weeks old they are chased out of the group by their mother — at which point they start a new group or join an existing one. Sexual maturity is reached at 5 months, with females taking slightly longer than males to reach maturity.

Dominant males attempt to maintain exclusive reproductive access to females, though females choose to mate with subordinate males about 40% of the time in a free-ranging feral flock in San Diego, California.

=== Diet ===
Red junglefowl are attracted to areas with ripe fruit or seeds, including fruit plantations, fields of domestic grain, and stands of bamboo. Although junglefowl typically eat fallen fruits and seeds on the ground, they occasionally forage in trees by perching on branches and feeding on hanging fruit. Fruits and seeds of scores of plant species have been identified from junglefowl crops, along with grasses, leaves, roots, and tubers. In addition, red junglefowl capture a wide variety of arthropods, other invertebrates, and vertebrates such as small lizards. Even mammalian faeces may be consumed. Many of these items are taken opportunistically as the birds forage, although some arthropods, such as termites, are taken in large quantities; about 1,000 individual termites have been found in a single crop. Plant materials constitute a higher proportion of the diet of adult red junglefowl than do arthropods and other animals. In contrast, chicks eat mostly adult and larval insects, earthworms, and only occasional plant material.

==Relationship to humans==

Chickens were created when red junglefowl were domesticated for human use around 8,000 years ago as subspecies &quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;. They are now a major source of food for humans. However, undomesticated red junglefowl still represent an important source of meat and eggs in their endemic range. The undomesticated form is sometimes used in cock-fighting.

=== Timeline of domestication ===
In 2012, a study examined mitochondrial DNA recovered from ancient bones from Europe, Thailand, the Pacific, and Chile, and from Spanish colonial sites in Florida and the Dominican Republic, in directly dated samples originating in Europe at 1,000 BP and in the Pacific at 3,000 BP. The chicken was primarily domesticated from red junglefowl, with subsequent genetic contributions from grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl, and green junglefowl. Domestication occurred about 8,000 years ago, as based on molecular evidence from a common ancestor flock in the bird&#x27;s natural range, and then proceeded in waves both east and west. Zoogeography and evolutionary biology point to the original domestication site of chickens as somewhere in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China in the Neolithic. Chickens were one of the ancestral domesticated animals of the Austronesian peoples. They were transported to Taiwan and the Philippines around 5,500 to 4,500 years ago. From there, they spread outwards with the Austronesian migrations to the rest of Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, and Polynesia in prehistoric times.

Other archaeological evidence suggests domestication dates around 7,400 BP from the Chishan site, in the Hebei province of China. However, the domestication event in China has now been disputed by several studies citing unfavourable weather conditions at the time. In the Ganges region of India, wild red junglefowl were being used by humans as early as 7,000 years ago. No domestic chicken remains older than 4,000 years have been identified in the Indus Valley, and the antiquity of chickens recovered from excavations at Mohenjodaro is still debated.
==Hybridization==
The other three members of the genus — Sri Lanka junglefowl (&quot;G. lafayetii&quot;), grey junglefowl (&quot;G. sonneratii&quot;), and green junglefowl (&quot;G. varius&quot;) — do not usually produce fertile hybrids with the red junglefowl. However, supporting the hypothesis of a hybrid origin, research published in 2008 found that the gene responsible for the yellow skin of the domestic chicken most likely originated in the closely related grey junglefowl and not from the red junglefowl. Similarly, a 2020 study that analysed the whole genomes of Sri Lanka junglefowl, grey junglefowl, and green junglefowl found strong introgressive hybridisation events in different populations of indigenous village chickens. The study also shows that 71–79% of red junglefowl DNA is shared with the domestic chicken. A culturally significant hybrid between the red junglefowl and the green junglefowl in Indonesia is known as the &quot;bekisar&quot;.

== Conservation status ==

Wild-type red junglefowl are thought to be facing threats due to hybridisation at forest edges, where domesticated free-ranging chickens are common. The red junglefowl is considered near threatened in Singapore. Nevertheless, they are classified by the IUCN as a species of least concern.

<doc id="470612" wikidata="Q730106" url="?curid=470612" title="Flag of Florida">
<text>The flag of Florida is the official flag of the U.S. state of Florida. The flag consists of a red saltire on a white background, with the state seal superimposed on the center. The flag&#x27;s current design has been in use since May 21, 1985, after the design of the Florida state seal was graphically improved and officially sanctioned for use by state officials. 

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association ranked Florida&#x27;s state flag 34th in design quality of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked. It is one of three U.S. state flags to feature the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; (the U.S. motto since 1956), with the other two being those of Georgia and Mississippi.

==History==

Spain was a dynastic union and federation of kingdoms when Juan Ponce de León claimed Florida for the Spanish Crown on April 2, 1513. Colonial authorities used several banners or standards during the first period of settlement and governance in Florida, such as the royal standard of the Crown of Castile. As with other Spanish territories, the Burgundian saltire was generally used in Florida to represent collective Spanish sovereignty between 1513 and 1821. 

In 1763, Spain passed control of Florida to Great Britain via the Treaty of Paris, following the latter&#x27;s victory over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, in exchange for other territory. Great Britain used the original union flag with the white diagonal stripes in Florida during this brief period. The British also divided the Florida territory into East Florida, with its capital at St. Augustine, and West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola. The border was the Apalachicola River.

Spain regained control of the Florida Provinces (las Floridas) after the Siege of Pensacola and the Treaty of Paris following the American Revolutionary War, when Britain ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River. In 1785, King Charles III chose a new naval and battle flag for Spain, which had become a more centralized nation-state, and its crown territories. This tri-band of red-gold-red was used with the Burgundian saltire in the provinces of East and West Florida until they joined the United States in 1821. Florida was admitted to the Union in 1845.

===Secession from the Union===

Between 1821 and 1861, Florida had no official flag. The inauguration of Governor William D. Moseley in 1845 featured a flag with bars of blue, gold, red, white and green, along with the motto &quot;Let Us Alone.&quot; However, this never was an official state flag.
In January 1861 Florida declared that it had seceded from the Union and declared itself a &quot;sovereign and independent nation,&quot; reaffirming the Preamble in the Constitution of 1838. The state used the Naval Ensign of Texas as a provisional flag between January and September 1861. It also used this flag when Floridian forces took control of U.S. forts and a Navy yard in Pensacola. Colonel William H. Chase was commander of Floridian troops, and the flag is also referred to as the Chase Flag. 

Later that year, the Florida Legislature passed a law authorizing Governor Perry to design an official flag. His design was the tri-band of the Confederacy but with the blue field extending down and the new seal of Florida placed within the blue field. As a member of the Confederacy, Florida saw use of all three versions of the Confederate flag. The Bonnie Blue flag, previously the flag of the short-lived Republic of West Florida, was briefly used as an unofficial flag of the Confederacy. It features a single five-point star centered in a blue background.

===Florida Constitution of 1868===
Between 1868 and 1900, the flag of Florida was the state seal on a white background. In a discrepancy, however, a later version of the state seal depicts a steamboat with a white flag that includes a red saltire, similar to Florida&#x27;s current flag. In the late 1890s, Florida governor Francis P. Fleming advocated adding a red St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross so that the flag would not appear to be a white flag of truce if hanging limp on a flagpole. Floridians approved the addition of St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross by popular referendum in 1900. The red saltire of the Cross of Burgundy represents the cross on which St. Andrew was crucified, and the standard is frequently displayed today in Florida&#x27;s historic Spanish settlements, such as St. Augustine.

===Historical Progression of Designs===
==Additional perspectives==
Some historians interpret the addition of a red saltire as a commemoration of Florida&#x27;s contributions to the Confederacy by Governor Francis P. Fleming, who served in the 2nd Florida Regiment, Confederate army. The addition was made during a period promoting the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; of the antebellum South, around the time of the flag&#x27;s change. According to historian John M. Coski, the Florida legislature adopted its new flag near the time when it disenfranchised African Americans and passed new Jim Crow laws and segregation. Other former Confederate slave states, such as Mississippi and Alabama, also adopted new state flags around the same time that they instituted segregation laws. 

Not all historians agree with assertions about association with the Confederacy. James C. Clark, a lecturer in the University of Central Florida&#x27;s history department, does not believe that Fleming&#x27;s new flag had anything to do with the Confederacy. &quot;That St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross that Fleming added, the red cross, dates back to the original flag the Spanish flew over Florida in the 16th century.&quot; Similarly, Canter Brown Jr., a Florida state-educated historian who has written extensively on Florida history, says he has &quot;seen no specific evidence linking this flag to the Confederate one.&quot;

<text>La Paz (, ) is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, with a 2020 census population of 250,141 inhabitants, making it the most populous city in the state. La Paz City is located in La Paz Municipality—the fourth-largest municipality in Mexico, by area and populace (with a reported 292,241 inhabitants), covering an area of . 

For air travelers, La Paz is served by Manuel Márquez de León International Airport, with connecting flights to some of Mexico&#x27;s main cities (Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, Tijuana), as well as other destinations across the north-northwest of the country (including Chihuahua City, Ciudad Juárez, Ciudad Obregón, Culiacán, Hermosillo, Mazatlán and Querétaro, among others). Seasonal services to American Airlines hubs Dallas, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, are also provided. Additionally, two ferry services operate from the port of Pichilingue, outside the city, connecting the Baja California Peninsula to the eastern mainland at Mazatlán and Topolobampo, Sinaloa (near Los Mochis).

Beginning in November 2024, Alaska Airlines will begin offering twice- to thrice-weekly direct flights between La Paz and Los Angeles, California, with daily flights to Monterrey, Nuevo León, scheduled to begin in February 2025. 

==History==
=== Spanish discovery ===

The first European known to have landed in Baja California was Fortún Ximénez. In 1533, shortly after the conquest of Tenochtitlan, Hernán Cortés sent two ships, &quot;Concepción&quot;, under the command of captain and commander of the expedition, , and &quot;San Lázaro&quot; under Capt. Hernando de Grijalva, to explore the South Seas of the Pacific Ocean. The ships set out 30 November 1533, to travel north along the coast of New Spain from present-day Manzanillo, Colima, in search of two ships that had been lost without a trace on a similar voyage the previous year. By 20 December the ships had separated; &quot;San Lázaro&quot;, which had gone ahead, waited three days for &quot;Concepción&quot; and after no sighting of its companion vessel, Capt. Grijalva dedicated himself to exploring the region and discovered the Revillagigedo Islands. On board the &quot;Concepción&quot;, Ximénez, the navigator and second in command, led a revolt in which Capt. Becerra was killed in his sleep by Ximénez. Also the crewmen loyal to the murdered captain were attacked and later rebel sailors abandoned both the wounded navigators and the Franciscan friars accompanying the expedition on the coast of present-day Michoacán.

Ximénez sailed to the northwest following the coast and at some point turned west and reached a bay that is now the port of the city of La Paz. Ximénez thought that he had found an island, and never knew that it was a large peninsula. There he met natives who wore few clothes and spoke an unknown language; their culture was very different from that of the inhabitants of the Mexican highlands. The crews of his ships saw the “scantily-clad” women and raped them. The Spaniards soon became aware of the large pearls that the natives extracted from the pearl oysters abounding in the bay, and proceeded to plunder the people and rape the women.

The abuse of the Indian women by the crew and their looting caused a violent confrontation with the natives that ended in the deaths of Ximénez and some of his companions; the survivors withdrew, and sailed erratically for several days until they reached the shores of the present-day Jalisco, where they encountered a subaltern of Nuño de Guzmán, who requisitioned the ship and took them prisoner.

=== Hernán Cortés arrival in California ===
Having sponsored two exploratory voyages in the South Seas just with some giant pearls samples, Cortés decided to lead a third exploration himself. Annoyed that his enemy, Nuño de Guzmán, had requisitioned one of his ships during the first expedition, Cortés decided to confront Guzmán on his own ground and from there set up the third expedition; consequently he prepared a large force of infantry and cavalry to march on the province of New Galicia (Nueva Galicia), of which Guzmán was governor.

The viceroy of New Spain, Antonio de Mendoza, warned Cortés on 4 September 1534, &quot;not to confront he who had requisitioned his ships&quot;, a warning which Hernán Cortés ignored, claiming that he had been designated to conquer and discover new territories, and that he had spent more than 100 thousand gold ducats of his own fortune. The feared confrontation between the armies of Cortés and Nuño de Guzmán did not occur.

In Chametla, (Sinaloa), after crossing the present-day states of Jalisco and Nayarit, territory then known as part of New Galicia, Cortés and his entourage embarked the ships &quot; Santa Águeda &quot; and &quot; San Lázaro &quot; with 113 crewmen and 40 cavalrymen with their horses and gear, leaving 60 riders on land, as reported to the Real Audiencia and Governor Nuño de Guzmán. Cortés then sailed northwest, and on 3 May 1535 arrived at the bay he named &quot;Bahia de la Santa Cruz&quot; (Bay of Santa Cruz), currently the port of La Paz, where he confirmed the death of his subordinate, Fortún Ximénez, at the hands of the natives. Once Cortés had taken possession of the bay, he decided to establish a colony and summoned the soldiers and arms he had left in Sinaloa. The transport ships were lost in a storm, however, and only one ship, carrying a load of fifty bushels of corn, returned. This was insufficient to feed the population, so Cortés left to personally secure food, but was unable to procure enough, so he decided to return to New Spain with the intention of supplying the new colony from there.

Francisco de Ulloa was in command of the town of La Paz, but complaints by relatives of those who had stayed on the peninsula caused the viceroy to order the population to abandon the colony and return to New Spain. Following the failure of Cortés&#x27; third expedition to establish a colony in the newly discovered lands that belonged to him by royal decree, an enemy of Cortés, whom a writer of the time cites as Alarcón, applied the name &quot;California,&quot; drawn from a contemporary novel, to the abandoned territory, perhaps in order to insult Cortés. The Baja California peninsula, the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez), and the states of California, Baja California and Baja California Sur, bear the name today.

From 10 January 1854, to 8 May 1854, La Paz served as the capital of William Walker&#x27;s Republic of Sonora. The project collapsed due to lack of US support and pressure from the Mexican government to retake the region.
== Geography ==

La Paz is located on the Baja California peninsula on the Bay of La Paz, south of Ciudad Constitución, municipality of Comondú, and north of Cabo San Lucas, municipality of Los Cabos. It is located north of the town of Todos Santos. Its geographical coordinates are 24°08′32″ N and parallel 110°18′39″W, it has an altitude of 0 to 27 meters above the sea level. It is one of the three state capitals of Mexico that are on the coast of the sea.

=== Climate ===
La Paz has a subtropical hot desert climate (BWh). The climate of La Paz is relatively consistent with generally little rainfall, with a year around average temperature of between . Summer months (July–September) typically see highs between and dew points of . The winter months (December–February) are the coldest with temperatures dropping below at night, but cold mostly are from . Breezes from Bahía de La Paz moderate the temperature. The bay also acts as a barrier against seasonal storms in the Gulf of California.

Rainfall is minimal at most times of year, although erratic downpours can bring heavy rains. Rain tends to be concentrated in a short, slightly rainier season that peaks in August and September, following the pattern of the North American Monsoon. The driest season, where it is common to have no rain, occurs March through June. La Paz averages over 300 days of sunshine annually and an average of 3148 sunshine hours.

During the summer the cooling Coromuel winds, a weather phenomenon unique to the La Paz area, blow during the night from the Pacific over the Peninsula and into the Bay of La Paz.

As with most of the Gulf of California, the temperature of the water changes substantially over the course of the year, with temperatures around during winter and around during summer.



==Economy==

The population of La Paz has grown greatly since the 2000s.

Eco-tourism is by far the most important source of tourism income in La Paz. Tourists also visit the city&#x27;s balnearios. There are some 900 islands and islets in the Gulf of California with 244 now under UNESCO protection as World Heritage Bio-Reserves and the Isla Espíritu Santo group, which borders the northeast portion of the Bay of La Paz, the primary tourist destination of the area.

Industries include silver mining, agriculture, fishing and pearls. Tourism is also an important source of employment for this coastal community.

The now defunct airline Aero California had its headquarters in La Paz.

==Transportation==

La Paz is served by Manuel Márquez de León International Airport with flights to Mexico&#x27;s 3 largest cities and the main cities of northwest Mexico on Aeroméxico Connect, Volaris, VivaAerobus, Calafia and TAR airlines; and American Airlines seasonal service to its hubs in Dallas and Phoenix. Two ferry services operate from the port of Pichilingue outside the city, connecting the Baja California peninsula to the mainland at Mazatlán and Topolobampo, near Los Mochis.

===Roads===
Running along the coast in front of La Paz is long Malecon Road. The main purpose of this road is to allow easy movement across the city. However, it quickly became the focal point of tourist related activities with a large number of bars, restaurants and shops opening along its length. Since 2004 extensive development has taken place which included a large sidewalk which offers safety for large numbers of people to walk along the coastal front of La Paz.

In September 2011, a bicycle lane was added to Malecon Road, providing cyclists protection from cars and pedestrians.

La Paz is served mainly by two highways; Mexican Federal Highway 1 that links the south of the state from Cabo San Lucas to the north of the peninsula to Tijuana, and Mexican Federal Highway 19, that connects La Paz with the population of the south pacific towns such as Todos Santos and El Pescadero. It is also served by two secondary roads, the Los Planes highway (286) that connects La Paz with towns such as La Ventana, Ensenada de los Muertos and Los Planes. The other is the Pichilingue highway which links La Paz with its maritime port.

== Cuisine ==

Local specialties are characterized by seafood dishes, especially of lobster, sole, clams and shrimp. Oregano is frequently used as a spice, and damiana, an ingredient in a traditional liqueur, is widely regarded as an aphrodisiac and brewed as a tea.

Regional cuisine also includes traditional dishes such as machaca, made from beef that has been well-cooked, shredded, and then cooked in its own juices, fresh cheeses and the typical flour tortillas. Abundantly available clams are prepared in various ways such as pickling, breading and frying, or stuffing. Shrimp are plentiful also, and eaten grilled, fried, or baked as in the regional specialty, &quot;filete imperial de camarones&quot;. Other popular seafood dishes include &quot;callo garra de león&quot;, made with scallops, fish &quot;tatemado&quot;, and ceviche.

Regional sweets are represented by fruits such as guava, mango and pitaya, green papaya and fig in syrup, as well as dehydrated regional fruits such as white fig and mango. Cheese empanadas (&quot;empanadas de queso&quot;) and empanadas made with sweet beans are also popular.

== Demographics ==

The city had a 2020 census population of 250,141 inhabitants, making it the most populous city in the state. Its metropolitan population is somewhat larger because of surrounding towns, such as El Centenario (pop. 6,068), Chametla (pop. 1,731 as of 2010) and San Pedro. Its surrounding municipality, which is the fourth-largest municipality in Mexico in geographical size, reported a population of 290,286 inhabitants.

==Education==
La Paz is the state capital and center of commerce, as well as the home of the three leading marine biology institutes in Latin America (UABCS, CIBNOR &amp; CICIMAR), largely because it sits on the Gulf of California, which is home to exceptional marine biodiversity. It also supports several other university-level institutes of learning, such as the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur.

La Paz is the headquarters of several higher education centers, the main ones being:
* Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur (UABCS)
* Universidad Tecnológica de La Paz (UTLP)
* Instituto Tecnológico de La Paz (ITLP)
* Universidad Mundial (UM)
* Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR)
* Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR)
* Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) Campus La Paz
* Benemérita Escuela Normal Urbana Prof. Domingo Carballo Félix (BENU)
* Escuela Normal Superior del Estado de Baja California Sur (ENSBCS)

== Health ==
La Paz has several medical centers; the Secretariat of Health operates the Juan María de Salvatierra general hospital, which has medical specialists and an exclusive area for pediatric oncology, as well as a unit that provides medical care under the national health insurance program, as well as a hemodialysis unit, a blood bank, a mental health division, health centers and other units. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) provides a family clinic and an ambulatory medical unit in which ambulatory surgeries are performed. There is also a new ISSSTE hospital, the Naval Sanatorium, and the Secretariat of National Defense hospital, which offers external consultation services, hospitalization and medical specialists.

Reflecting high national rates, there are similarly high local rates of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and renal insufficiency, as well as of automobile accidents resulting in injury, despite public health dissemination programs and driver education programs.

According to the Baja California Sur State Development Plan 2005-2011, during 2006 there were 24 deaths due to cervical cancer in the state. The health sector seeks to reduce cervical cancer mortality by providing timely treatment to women aged 25 to 64 years, and improving the efficiency of diagnostic laboratories and the monitoring of patients.

As of 1 March 2021, the municipality reported 11,558 recoveries, 577 active cases, and 436 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

==In popular culture==
John Steinbeck visited La Paz in 1940. He describes the town in his 1947 novel &quot;The Pearl&quot; and mentions it extensively in his 1951 travelogue &quot;The Log from the Sea of Cortez&quot;.

The city is also the setting of the 1967 Scott O&#x27;Dell children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Black Pearl&quot;, chosen as a Newbery Honor Book in 1968; La Paz is the home of the main character.

<doc id="470622" wikidata="Q837312" url="?curid=470622" title="Flag of North Dakota">
<text>The flag of North Dakota represents the U.S. state of North Dakota. Adopted on March 11, 1911, its design is an almost exact replica of the regimental banner carried by the state&#x27;s troop contingent in the Philippine–American War, the only difference being that the unit designation inscribed on the scroll was replaced by the state&#x27;s name.

==History==
The North Dakota flag&#x27;s design was officially approved by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly on March 3, 1911, although the color was not specified at the time. Legislation in 1943 brought the flag in line with the original troop banner.

==Design and specifications==

The flag&#x27;s official proportions are 33:26, which is notably shorter than many other state flags. However, in practice, the flag is often produced and sold in 5:3 ratios. The state code specifies that the flag must be made from blue silk or another material capable of withstanding the elements.

According to state law, the design of the flag mirrors that of the First North Dakota Infantry&#x27;s standard during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War. This makes the flag similar to the greater coat of arms of the United States, and nearly identical to many other regimental standards.

A banner with the national coat of arms was carried by all infantry regiments from 1890 to 1904, with the sole distinction being the unit designation inscribed on the scroll underneath the coat of arms. The regimental colors of the North Dakotan troops, for instance, were adorned with the inscription &quot;1st North Dakota Infantry&quot;.

It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming.

==1951 Flag Commission==

In 1951, the North Dakota State Flag Commission was established by S.B. No. 156 (1951 S.L., ch.303) to evaluate the state flag&#x27;s design. Composed of five members appointed by the Governor, the Commission operated until December 31, 1952, with a mandate to thoroughly assess the flag&#x27;s origins, dimensions, and its suitability as a symbol for North Dakota.

Regarding the flag&#x27;s suitability as a symbol of North Dakota, the commission weighed both its historical significance and its alignment with the state&#x27;s identity. While acknowledging its long-standing presence since 1911 and its association with North Dakota troops in historic conflicts, the commission noted that these factors alone did not inherently make it emblematic of the state. Examining the design&#x27;s resemblance to the United States coat of arms, the commission emphasized the importance of distinctiveness. Despite minor variations, they deemed the flag too closely resembled the national emblem, suggesting that its symbolism belonged to the entire nation rather than any individual state.

In pursuit of a more fitting motif, the commission explored various avenues including historical figures, state nicknames, and indigenous symbols. However, each option presented challenges or lacked resonance with North Dakota&#x27;s identity. Certain themes were also deemed either historically inaccurate or too regionally specific. Interestingly, the commission deemed the sources of symbolism that would be used for the state&#x27;s coat of arms as unsuitable, leaving only the color palette as a point of agreement.

Through a process of elimination, the commission arrived at wheat and sunset as the most suitable symbols for the state flag. Wheat, as the primary crop and symbol of North Dakota&#x27;s agricultural heritage, represented the state&#x27;s economic backbone. While the breathtaking sunsets unique to North Dakota captured the state&#x27;s natural beauty and awe-inspiring landscapes. The commission&#x27;s recommendation thus crystallized into a proposal: a green flag adorned with golden wheat stems and heads, accompanied by a radiant golden sunset—a tribute to North Dakota&#x27;s agricultural prowess and celestial splendor. This design aimed to encapsulate the essence of the state&#x27;s identity while adhering to principles of originality, symbolism, and simplicity, as outlined by the commission&#x27;s thorough examination of flag design principles and historical context.

The proposed changes were ultimately met with resistance. S.B. No. 265, incorporating the Commission&#x27;s suggestions, was presented in the 1953 session but failed to pass.

<doc id="470625" wikidata="Q65332" url="?curid=470625" title="Constantin Carathéodory">
<text>Constantin Carathéodory (; 13 September 1873 – 2 February 1950) was a Greek mathematician who spent most of his professional career in Germany. He made significant contributions to real and complex analysis, the calculus of variations, and measure theory. He also created an axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics. Carathéodory is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of his era and the most renowned Greek mathematician since antiquity.

== Origins ==
Constantin Carathéodory was born in 1873 in Berlin to Greek parents and grew up in Brussels. His father , a lawyer, served as the Ottoman ambassador to Belgium, St. Petersburg and Berlin. His mother, Despina, née Petrokokkinos, was from the island of Chios. The Carathéodory family, originally from Bosnochori or Vyssa, was well established and respected in Constantinople, and its members held many important governmental positions.

The Carathéodory family spent 1874–75 in Constantinople, where Constantin&#x27;s paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin&#x27;s younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin&#x27;s paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin&#x27;s mother Despina died of pneumonia in Cannes. Constantin&#x27;s maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father&#x27;s home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.

Constantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883–84 and 1884–85 on the Italian Riviera. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Athénée Royal d&#x27;Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.

At this stage Carathéodory began training as a military engineer. He attended the École Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the École d&#x27;Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 a war broke out between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carathéodory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the Assiut dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot; and Salmon&#x27;s text on the analytic geometry of conic sections. He also visited the Cheops pyramid and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901. He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country.

== Studies and university career ==

Carathéodory studied engineering in Belgium at the Royal Military Academy, where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.

===University career===

===Doctoral students===
Carathéodory had about 20 doctoral students among these being Hans Rademacher, known for his work on analysis and number theory, and Paul Finsler known for his creation of Finsler space.

===Academic contacts in Germany===
Carathéodory had numerous contacts in Germany. They included such famous names as: Hermann Minkowski, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Albert Einstein, Edmund Landau, Hermann Amandus Schwarz, and Lipót Fejér. During the difficult period of World War II, his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.

Einstein, then a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was working on his general theory of relativity when he contacted Carathéodory for clarifications on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and canonical transformations. He wanted to see a satisfactory derivation of the former and the origins of the latter. Einstein told Carathéodory his derivation was &quot;beautiful&quot; and recommended its publication in the &quot;Annalen der Physik.&quot; Einstein employed the former in a 1917 paper titled &quot;Zum Quantensatz von Sommerfeld und Epstein&quot; (On the Quantum Theorem of Sommerfeld and Epstein). Carathéodory explained some fundamental details of the canonical transformations and referred Einstein to E.T. Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;Analytical Dynamics&quot;. Einstein was trying to solve the problem of &quot;closed time-lines&quot; or the geodesics corresponding to the closed trajectory of light and free particles in a static universe, which he introduced in 1917.

Landau and Schwarz stimulated his interest in the study of complex analysis.

===Academic contacts in Greece===
While in Germany, Carathéodory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world, details of which can be found in Georgiadou&#x27;s book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at Göttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carathéodory helped the Greek topologist Christos Papakyriakopoulos take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching at Athens University, Carathéodory had Evangelos Stamatis as an undergraduate student, who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.

== Works ==
===Calculus of variations===
In his doctoral dissertation, Carathéodory showed how to extend solutions to discontinuous cases and studied isoperimetric problems.

Previously, between the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s, Leonhard Euler, Adrien-Marie Legendre, and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi were able to establish necessary but insufficient conditions for the existence of a strong relative minimum. In 1879, Karl Weierstrass added a fourth that does indeed guarantee such a quantity exists. Carathéodory constructed his method for deriving sufficient conditions based on the use of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as &quot;Carathéodory&#x27;s method of equivalent variational problems&quot; or &quot;the royal road to the calculus of variations&quot;. A key advantage of Carathéodory&#x27;s work on this topic is that it illuminates the relation between the calculus of variations and partial differential equations. It allows for quick and elegant derivations of conditions of sufficiency in the calculus of variations and leads directly to the Euler-Lagrange equation and the Weierstrass condition. He published his &quot;Variationsrechnung und Partielle Differentialgleichungen Erster Ordnung&quot; (Calculus of Variations and First-order Partial Differential Equations) in 1935.

More recently, Carathéodory&#x27;s work on the calculus of variations and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been taken into the theory of optimal control and dynamic programming.

===Convex geometry===
Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem in convex geometry states that if a point formula_1 of formula_2 lies in the convex hull of a set formula_3, then formula_1 can be written as the convex combination of at most formula_5 points in formula_3. Namely, there is a subset formula_7 of formula_3 consisting of formula_5 or fewer points such that formula_1 lies in the convex hull of formula_7. Equivalently, formula_1 lies in an formula_13-simplex with vertices in formula_3, where formula_15. The smallest formula_13 that makes the last statement valid for each formula_1 in the convex hull of &quot;P&quot; is defined as the &quot;Carathéodory&#x27;s number&quot; of formula_3. Depending on the properties of formula_3, upper bounds lower than the one provided by Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem can be obtained.

He is credited with the authorship of the Carathéodory conjecture claiming that a closed convex surface admits at least two umbilic points. The conjecture was proven in 2024 by Brendan Guilfoyle and Wilhelm Klingenberg. 

===Real analysis===
He proved an existence theorem for the solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.

Another theorem of his on the derivative of a function at a point could be used to prove the Chain Rule and the formula for the derivative of inverse functions.

===Complex analysis===
He greatly extended the theory of conformal transformation proving his theorem about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains. In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of prime ends. He exhibited an elementary proof of the Schwarz lemma.

Carathéodory was also interested in the theory of functions of multiple complex variables. In his investigations on this subject he sought analogs of classical results from the single-variable case. He proved that a ball in formula_20 is not holomorphically equivalent to the bidisc.

===Theory of measure===
He is credited with the Carathéodory extension theorem which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carathéodory extended the theory from sets to Boolean algebras.

===Thermodynamics===
Thermodynamics had been a subject dear to Carathéodory since his time in Belgium. In 1909, he published a pioneering work &quot;Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics&quot; in which he formulated the second law of thermodynamics axiomatically, that is, without the use of Carnot engines and refrigerators and only by mathematical reasoning. This is yet another version of the second law, alongside the statements of Clausius, and of Kelvin and Planck. Carathéodory&#x27;s version attracted the attention of some of the top physicists of the time, including Max Planck, Max Born, and Arnold Sommerfeld. According to Bailyn&#x27;s survey of thermodynamics, Carathéodory&#x27;s approach is called &quot;mechanical,&quot; rather than &quot;thermodynamic.&quot; Max Born acclaimed this &quot;first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics&quot; and he expressed his enthusiasm in his letters to Einstein. However, Max Planck had some misgivings in that while he was impressed by Carathéodory&#x27;s mathematical prowess, he did not accept that this was a fundamental formulation, given the statistical nature of the second law.

In his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance &quot;heat&quot; is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The second law of thermodynamics was expressed via the following axiom: &quot;In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.&quot; In this connexion he coined the term adiabatic accessibility.

===Optics===
Carathéodory&#x27;s work in optics is closely related to his method in the calculus of variations. In 1926 he gave a strict and general proof that no system of lenses and mirrors can avoid aberration, except for the trivial case of plane mirrors.
In his later work he gave the theory of the Schmidt telescope. In his &quot;Geometrische Optik&quot; (1937), Carathéodory demonstrated the equivalence of Huygens&#x27; principle and Fermat&#x27;s principle starting from the former using Cauchy&#x27;s theory of characteristics. He argued that an important advantage of his approach was that it covers the integral invariants of Henri Poincaré and Élie Cartan and completes the Malus law. He explained that in his investigations in optics, Pierre de Fermat conceived a minimum principle similar to that enunciated by Hero of Alexandria to study reflection.

===Historical===
During the Second World War Carathéodory edited two volumes of Euler&#x27;s Complete Works dealing with the Calculus of Variations which were submitted for publication in 1946.

== The University of Smyrna ==
At the time, Athens was the only major educational centre in the wider area and had limited capacity to sufficiently satisfy the growing educational needs of the eastern part of the Aegean Sea and the Balkans. Carathéodory, who was a professor at the University of Berlin at the time, proposed the establishment of a new university - the difficulties regarding the establishment of a Greek university in Constantinople led him to consider three other cities: Thessaloniki, Chios and Smyrna.

At the invitation of the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, he submitted a plan on 20 October 1919 for the creation of a new university at Smyrna in Asia Minor, to be named Ionian University of Smyrna. In 1920 Carathéodory was appointed dean of the university and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students, due to the War in Asia Minor which ended in the Great Fire of Smyrna. Carathéodory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who took him by rowboat to the battleship Naxos which was standing by. Carathéodory brought to Athens some of the university library and stayed there, teaching at the university and technical school until 1924.

In 1924 Carathéodory was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Munich, and held this position until retirement in 1938. He later worked at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.

The new Greek university in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carathéodory, finally materialised with the establishment of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1925.

== Linguistic and oratorical talents ==
Carathéodory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family. Greek and French were his first languages, and he mastered German with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks. Carathéodory also spoke and wrote English, Italian, Turkish, and the ancient languages without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extended his fields of knowledge.

Much more than that, Carathéodory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected German philologist and professor of ancient languages, Kurt von Fritz, praised Carathéodory on the grounds that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Von Fritz conducted numerous philosophical discussions with Carathéodory.

The mathematician sent his son Stephanos and daughter Despina to a German high school, but they also obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest, and at home he allowed them to speak Greek only.

Carathéodory was a talented public speaker, and was often invited to give speeches. In 1936, it was he who handed out the first ever Fields Medals at the meeting of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo, Norway.

== Legacy ==

In 2002, in recognition of his achievements, the University of Munich named one of the largest lecture rooms in the mathematical institute the Constantin-Carathéodory Lecture Hall.

In the town of Nea Vyssa, Caratheodory&#x27;s ancestral home, a unique family museum is to be found. The museum is located in the central square of the town near to its church, and includes a number of Karatheodory&#x27;s personal items, as well as letters he exchanged with Albert Einstein. More information is provided at the original website of the club, http://www.s-karatheodoris.gr.

At the same time, Greek authorities had long since intended to create a museum honoring Karatheodoris in Komotini, a major town of the northeastern Greek region, more than 200 km away from his home town above. On 21 March 2009, the &quot;Karatheodoris&quot; Museum (Καραθεοδωρής) opened its gates to the public in Komotini.

The coordinator of the museum, Athanasios Lipordezis (Αθανάσιος Λιπορδέζης), has noted that the museum provides a home for original manuscripts of the mathematician running to about 10,000 pages, including correspondence with the German mathematician Arthur Rosenthal for the algebraization of measure. At the showcase, visitors are also able to view the books &quot;&quot; Gesammelte mathematische Schriften Band 1,2,3,4 &quot;, &quot;Mass und ihre Algebraiserung&quot;, &quot; Reelle Functionen Band 1&quot;, &quot; Zahlen/Punktionen Funktionen &quot;&quot;, and a number of others. Handwritten letters by Carathéodory to Albert Einstein and Hellmuth Kneser, as well as photographs of the Carathéodory family, are on display.

Efforts to furnish the museum with more exhibits are ongoing.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Armand Louis Léonce Élie de Beaumont (25 September 1798 – 21 September 1874) was a French geologist.

==Biography==
Élie de Beaumont was born at Canon, in Calvados. He was educated at the Lycee Henri IV where he took the first prize in mathematics and physics at the École polytechnique, where he stood first at the exit examination in 1819; and at the École des mines (1819–1822), where he began to show a decided preference for the science with which his name is associated. In 1823 he was selected along with Dufrénoy by Brochant de Villiers, the professor of geology in the École des Mines, to accompany him on a scientific tour to England and Scotland, in order to inspect the mining and metallurgical establishments of the country, and to study the principles on which George Bellas Greenough&#x27;s geological map of England (1820) had been prepared, with a view to the construction of a similar map of France.

In 1835 he was appointed professor of geology at the École des Mines, in succession to Brochant de Villiers, whose assistant he had been in the duties of the chair since 1827. He held the office of engineer-in-chief of mines in France from 1833 until 1847, when he was appointed inspector-general; and in 1861 he became vice-president of the Conseil-General des Mines and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. His growing scientific reputation secured his election to the membership of the Academy of Berlin, of the French Academy of Sciences, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1845), of the Royal Society of London, as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1848), and as an international member of the American Philosophical Society (1860). By a decree of the president he was made a senator of France in 1852, and on the death of François Arago in 1853 he was chosen as perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences.

Élie de Beaumont&#x27;s name is widely known to geologists in connection with his theory of the origin of mountain ranges, first propounded in a paper read to the Academy of Sciences in 1829, and afterwards elaborated in his &quot;Notice sur le système des montagnes&quot; (3 volumes, 1852). According to his view, all mountain ranges parallel to the same great circle of the earth are of strictly contemporaneous origin, and between the great circles a relation of symmetry exists in the form of a pentagonal réseau. An elaborate statement and criticism of the theory was given in his anniversary address to the Geological Society of London in 1853 by William Hopkins. The theory did not find general acceptance, but it proved of great value to geological science, owing to the extensive additions to the knowledge of the structure of mountain ranges which its author made in endeavouring to find facts to support it.

Mount Elie de Beaumont is in the Westland Tai Poutini National Park, on the west coast of New Zealand&#x27;s the South Island and near the boundary with Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. It is 3109m high.

Probably the best service Élie de Beaumont rendered to science, however, was in connection with the geological map of France, in the preparation of which he had the leading share. During this period Élie de Beaumont published many important memoirs on the geology of the country. After his retirement from the École des Mines he continued to superintend the issue of the detailed maps almost until his death, which occurred at Canon. His academic lectures for 1843-1844 were published in 2 volumes, (1845–1849), under the title &quot;Leçons de Géologie pratique&quot;.

<doc id="470632" wikidata="Q2920850" url="?curid=470632" title="Connection (principal bundle)">
<text>In mathematics, and especially differential geometry and gauge theory, a connection is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to &quot;connect&quot; or identify fibers over nearby points. A principal &quot;G&quot;-connection on a principal G-bundle formula_1 over a smooth manifold &quot;formula_2&quot; is a particular type of connection that is compatible with the action of the group &quot;formula_3&quot;.

A principal connection can be viewed as a special case of the notion of an Ehresmann connection, and is sometimes called a principal Ehresmann connection. It gives rise to (Ehresmann) connections on any fiber bundle associated to &quot;formula_1&quot; via the associated bundle construction. In particular, on any associated vector bundle the principal connection induces a covariant derivative, an operator that can differentiate sections of that bundle along tangent directions in the base manifold. Principal connections generalize to arbitrary principal bundles the concept of a linear connection on the frame bundle of a smooth manifold.

==Formal definition==

Let formula_5 be a smooth principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle over a smooth manifold formula_2. Then a principal formula_3-connection on formula_1 is a differential 1-form on formula_1 with values in the Lie algebra formula_10 of formula_3 which is formula_3-equivariant and reproduces the Lie algebra generators of the fundamental vector fields on formula_1.

In other words, it is an element &quot;ω&quot; of formula_14 such that
# formula_15 where formula_16 denotes right multiplication by formula_17, and formula_18 is the adjoint representation on formula_19 (explicitly, formula_20);
# if formula_21 and formula_22 is the vector field on &quot;P&quot; associated to &quot;ξ&quot; by differentiating the &quot;G&quot; action on &quot;P&quot;, then formula_23 (identically on formula_1).

Sometimes the term &quot;principal formula_3-connection&quot; refers to the pair formula_26 and formula_27 itself is called the connection form or connection 1-form of the principal connection.

=== Computational remarks ===
Most known non-trivial computations of principal &quot;formula_3&quot;-connections are done with homogeneous spaces because of the triviality of the (co)tangent bundle. (For example, let formula_29, be a principal &quot;formula_3&quot;-bundle over formula_31.) This means that 1-forms on the total space are canonically isomorphic to formula_32, where formula_33 is the dual lie algebra, hence &quot;formula_3&quot;-connections are in bijection with formula_35.

===Relation to Ehresmann connections===
A principal &quot;formula_3&quot;-connection formula_27 on formula_1 determines an Ehresmann connection on formula_1 in the following way. First note that the fundamental vector fields generating the formula_3 action on formula_1 provide a bundle isomorphism (covering the identity of formula_1) from the bundle formula_43 to formula_44, where formula_45 is the kernel of the tangent mapping formula_46 which is called the vertical bundle of formula_1. It follows that formula_27 determines uniquely a bundle map formula_49 which is the identity on formula_43. Such a projection formula_51 is uniquely determined by its kernel, which is a smooth subbundle formula_52 of formula_53 (called the horizontal bundle) such that formula_54. This is an Ehresmann connection.

Conversely, an Ehresmann connection formula_55 (or formula_49) on formula_1 defines a principal formula_3-connection formula_27 if and only if it is formula_3-equivariant in the sense that formula_61.

===Pull back via trivializing section===
A trivializing section of a principal bundle &quot;formula_1&quot; is given by a section &quot;s&quot; of &quot;formula_1&quot; over an open subset &quot;formula_64&quot; of &quot;formula_2&quot;. Then the pullback &quot;s&quot;*&quot;ω&quot; of a principal connection is a 1-form on &quot;formula_64&quot; with values in formula_10.
If the section &quot;s&quot; is replaced by a new section &quot;sg&quot;, defined by (&quot;sg&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;g&quot;:&quot;M&quot;→&quot;G&quot; is a smooth map, then formula_68. The principal connection is uniquely determined by this family of formula_10-valued 1-forms, and these 1-forms are also called connection forms or connection 1-forms, particularly in older or more physics-oriented literature.

===Bundle of principal connections===
The group &quot;formula_3&quot; acts on the tangent bundle &quot;formula_53&quot; by right translation. The quotient space &quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is also a manifold, and inherits the structure of a fibre bundle over &quot;TM&quot; which shall be denoted &quot;dπ&quot;:&quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot;→&quot;TM&quot;. Let ρ:&quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot;→&quot;M&quot; be the projection onto &quot;M&quot;. The fibres of the bundle &quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot; under the projection ρ carry an additive structure.

The bundle &quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is called the bundle of principal connections . A section Γ of dπ:&quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot;→&quot;TM&quot; such that Γ : &quot;TM&quot; → &quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot; is a linear morphism of vector bundles over &quot;M&quot;, can be identified with a principal connection in &quot;P&quot;. Conversely, a principal connection as defined above gives rise to such a section Γ of &quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot;.

Finally, let Γ be a principal connection in this sense. Let &quot;q&quot;:&quot;TP&quot;→&quot;TP&quot;/&quot;G&quot; be the quotient map. The horizontal distribution of the connection is the bundle

:formula_72 We see again the link to the horizontal bundle and thus Ehresmann connection.

===Affine property===
If &quot;ω&quot; and &quot;ω&quot;′ are principal connections on a principal bundle &quot;P&quot;, then the difference is a formula_10-valued 1-form on &quot;P&quot; that is not only &quot;G&quot;-equivariant, but horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on any section of the vertical bundle &quot;V&quot; of &quot;P&quot;. Hence it is basic and so is determined by a 1-form on &quot;M&quot; with values in the adjoint bundle
:formula_74
Conversely, any such one form defines (via pullback) a &quot;G&quot;-equivariant horizontal 1-form on &quot;P&quot;, and the space of principal &quot;G&quot;-connections is an affine space for this space of 1-forms.

== Examples ==

=== Maurer-Cartan connection ===
For the trivial principal formula_3-bundle formula_76 where formula_77, there is a canonical connectionpg 49formula_78called the Maurer-Cartan connection. It is defined at a point formula_79 byformula_80 for formula_81which is a compositionformula_82defining the 1-form. Note thatformula_83is the Maurer-Cartan form on the Lie group formula_3 and formula_85.

=== Trivial bundle ===
For a trivial principal formula_3-bundle formula_76, the identity section formula_88 given by formula_89 defines a 1-1 correspondenceformula_90between connections on formula_91 and formula_92-valued 1-forms on formula_93pg 53. For a formula_92-valued 1-form formula_95 on formula_93, there is a unique 1-form formula_97 on formula_91 such that

# formula_99 for formula_100 a vertical vector
# formula_101 for any formula_102

Then given this 1-form, a connection on formula_91 can be constructed by taking the sumformula_104giving an actual connection on formula_91. This unique 1-form can be constructed by first looking at it restricted to formula_106 for formula_107. Then, formula_108 is determined by formula_95 because formula_110 and we can get formula_111by takingformula_112Similarly, the formformula_113defines a 1-form giving the properties 1 and 2 listed above.

==== Extending this to non-trivial bundles ====
This statement can be refinedpg 55 even further for non-trivial bundles formula_114 by considering an open covering formula_115 of formula_93 with trivializations formula_117 and transition functions formula_118. Then, there is a 1-1 correspondence between connections on formula_91 and collections of 1-formsformula_120which satisfyformula_121on the intersections formula_122 for formula_123 the Maurer-Cartan form on formula_3, formula_125 in matrix form.

==== Global reformulation of space of connections ====
For a principal formula_3 bundle formula_127 the set of connections in formula_91 is an affine spacepg 57 for the vector space formula_129 where formula_130 is the associated adjoint vector bundle. This implies for any two connections formula_131 there exists a form formula_132 such thatformula_133We denote the set of connections as formula_134, or just formula_135 if the context is clear.

=== Connection on the complex Hopf-bundle ===
Wepg 94 can construct formula_136 as a principal formula_137-bundle formula_138 where formula_139 and formula_140 is the projection mapformula_141Note the Lie algebra of formula_142 is just the complex plane. The 1-form formula_143 defined asformula_144forms a connection, which can be checked by verifying the definition. For any fixed formula_145 we haveformula_146and since formula_147, we have formula_137-invariance. This is because the adjoint action is trivial since the Lie algebra is Abelian. For constructing the splitting, note for any formula_149 we have a short exact sequenceformula_150where formula_151 is defined asformula_152so it acts as scaling in the fiber (which restricts to the corresponding formula_137-action). Taking formula_154 we get

formula_155

where the second equality follows because we are considering formula_156 a vertical tangent vector, and formula_157. The notation is somewhat confusing, but if we expand out each termformula_158it becomes more clear (where formula_159).

==Induced covariant and exterior derivatives==
For any linear representation &quot;W&quot; of &quot;G&quot; there is an associated vector bundle formula_160 over &quot;M&quot;, and a principal connection induces a covariant derivative on any such vector bundle. This covariant derivative can be defined using the fact that the space of sections of formula_160 over &quot;M&quot; is isomorphic to the space of &quot;G&quot;-equivariant &quot;W&quot;-valued functions on &quot;P&quot;. More generally, the space of &quot;k&quot;-forms with values in formula_160 is identified with the space of &quot;G&quot;-equivariant and horizontal &quot;W&quot;-valued &quot;k&quot;-forms on &quot;P&quot;. If &quot;α&quot; is such a &quot;k&quot;-form, then its exterior derivative d&quot;α&quot;, although &quot;G&quot;-equivariant, is no longer horizontal. However, the combination d&quot;α&quot;+&quot;ω&quot;Λ&quot;α&quot; is. This defines an exterior covariant derivative d&quot;ω&quot; from formula_160-valued &quot;k&quot;-forms on &quot;M&quot; to formula_160-valued (&quot;k&quot;+1)-forms on &quot;M&quot;. In particular, when &quot;k&quot;=0, we obtain a covariant derivative on formula_160.

==Curvature form==
The curvature form of a principal &quot;G&quot;-connection &quot;ω&quot; is the formula_10-valued 2-form Ω defined by
:formula_167
It is &quot;G&quot;-equivariant and horizontal, hence corresponds to a 2-form on &quot;M&quot; with values in formula_168. The identification of the curvature with this quantity is sometimes called the &quot;(Cartan&#x27;s) second structure equation&quot;. Historically, the emergence of the structure equations are found in the development of the Cartan connection. When transposed into the context of Lie groups, the structure equations are known as the Maurer–Cartan equations: they are the same equations, but in a different setting and notation.

=== Flat connections and characterization of bundles with flat connections ===
We say that a connection formula_27 is flat if its curvature form formula_170. There is a useful characterization of principal bundles with flat connections; that is, a principal formula_3-bundle formula_172 has a flat connectionpg 68 if and only if there exists an open covering formula_173 with trivializations formula_174 such that all transition functionsformula_175are constant. This is useful because it gives a recipe for constructing flat principal formula_3-bundles over smooth manifolds; namely taking an open cover and defining trivializations with constant transition functions.

==Connections on frame bundles and torsion==
If the principal bundle &quot;P&quot; is the frame bundle, or (more generally) if it has a solder form, then the connection is an example of an affine connection, and the curvature is not the only invariant, since the additional structure of the solder form &quot;θ&quot;, which is an equivariant R&quot;n&quot;-valued 1-form on &quot;P&quot;, should be taken into account. In particular, the torsion form on &quot;P&quot;, is an R&quot;n&quot;-valued 2-form Θ defined by
:formula_177
Θ is &quot;G&quot;-equivariant and horizontal, and so it descends to a tangent-valued 2-form on &quot;M&quot;, called the &quot;torsion&quot;. This equation is sometimes called the &quot;(Cartan&#x27;s) first structure equation&quot;.

==Definition in algebraic geometry==

If &quot;X&quot; is a scheme (or more generally, stack, derived stack, or even prestack), we can associate to it its so-called &quot;de Rham stack&quot;, denoted &quot;XdR&quot;. This has the property that a principal &quot;G&quot; bundle over &quot;XdR&quot; is the same thing as a &quot;G&quot; bundle with *flat* connection over &quot;X&quot;.

<doc id="470634" wikidata="Q5379490" url="?curid=470634" title="Enquire Within upon Everything">
<text>Enquire Within upon Everything is a how-to book, akin to a short encyclopedia for domestic life, first published in 1856 by Houlston and Sons of Paternoster Square in London. The editor was Robert Kemp Philp. It was then continuously reprinted in many new and updated editions as additional information and articles were added (and obsolete material sometimes removed).

== Topics ==
The book was created with the intention of providing encyclopedic information on topics as diverse as etiquette, parlour games, cake recipes, laundry tips, holiday preparation, and first aid: To quote from the editor&#x27;s introduction:

Though not rich in such material, &quot;Enquire Within&quot; also provided the basics of an English-usage style guide, and also preserved examples of regional dialect usage (which it tended to mock as faulty). Several editions between the 1880s and 1910s provide one of the only surviving records of the rules of the English version of trucco, a somewhat croquet-like form of ground billiards. Though some attempt was made to group related topics, in general the organization was chaotic, and required looking up topics in an index, then finding their numbered sections in the main text.

== History ==
The early editions of this book contained 3,000 short pithy descriptions and was one of a set of 20 books.
The book was a popular addition to the Victorian (and later post-Victorian) home. By 1862, the book was sold 196,000 times; by the 89th edition, some 1,180,000 copies had been published. With the release of the 113th edition, this number had risen to over 1,500,000 and by 1976 was in its 126th edition. Modernised versions were still in print as late as 1994. Unauthorized reproductions of the first and some subsequent editions, without credit to the original editor and publisher, were made in United States by the New York publisher Garret, Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, under the title &quot;Inquire Within for Anything You Want to Know&quot;. Later official editions (some time after 1894) were published by Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton Kent &amp; Co., also of London.

Agatha Christie used &quot;Enquire Within upon Everything&quot; as an important clue in the Hercule Poirot detective novel, &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;.

In 1980 Tim Berners-Lee named his precursor of the World Wide Web ENQUIRE after this work. A &quot;Forbes&quot; article quoted Berners-Lee as saying:

He became an F-15 fighter pilot with the rare combination of having graduated the Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC, pronounced &#x27;Fwick&#x27;) and then selected as a test pilot (assigned to the F-16 test squadron at Edwards AFB). He earned his master&#x27;s degree in Engineering Management from Old Dominion University in 1993.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in December 1994, Bloomfield reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. He worked as Chief of Safety for the Astronaut Office, Chief Instructor Astronaut, Director of Shuttle Operations, and Chief of the Shuttle Branch, which oversees all Shuttle technical issues for the Astronaut Office.

He first flew as a pilot aboard STS-86 in 1997, where he docked with the space station Mir. Bloomfield also piloted STS-97 in 2000 and commanded STS-110 in 2002, both missions to the International Space Station.

Bloomfield has served as Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas since 2006, before resigning from NASA in July 2007. Michael then became Vice President of the Constellation Program for ATK.

<doc id="470655" wikidata="Q1020776" url="?curid=470655" title="Cabo San Lucas">
<text>Cabo San Lucas (, &quot;Saint Luke Cape&quot;), also known simply as Cabo, is a resort city at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. As of the 2020 Census, the population of the city was 202,694. Cabo San Lucas and the neighboring San José del Cabo are collectively known as Los Cabos. Together, they form a metropolitan area of 351,111 inhabitants.

Rated as one of Mexico&#x27;s top tourist destinations, Cabo San Lucas is known for its beaches, scuba diving locations, Balnearios, the sea arch El Arco de Cabo San Lucas, and marine life. The Los Cabos Corridor has become a heavily trafficked vacation destination for tourists, with numerous resorts and timeshares along the coast between Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo.

The waters around Cabo are home to a variety of marine wildlife including rays, sharks, mahi-mahi (dorado), and striped marlin.

==History==
Archaeological excavations have shown evidence of continual human habitation in the area for at least 10,000 years. When the first Europeans arrived, they encountered the Pericú people, who survived on a subsistence diet based on hunting and gathering seeds, roots, shellfish, and other marine resources. They called the location &quot;Yenecamú&quot;.

According to the narrative of Hatsutaro, a Japanese castaway, in the book &quot;Kaigai Ibun&quot; (written by Maekawa, Junzo, and Bunzo Sakai and narrated by Hatsutaro), when he arrived at Cabo San Lucas in May 1842, there were only two houses and about 20 inhabitants. However, American authors such as Henry Edwards and John Ross Browne claim that Cabo San Lucas&#x27;s founder was an Englishman named Thomas &quot;Old Tom&quot; Ritchie. John Ross Browne says Ritchie arrived there about 1828, while Edwards says that he died in October 1874. The actual founder of Cabo San Lucas was Cipriano Ceseña in 1788 who arrived from Hermosillo, Sonora. Per The book by Pablo L. Martinez, Guia Familiar de Baja California, 1700–1900.

A fishing village began growing in the area. In 1917, an American company built a floating platform to catch tuna, and ten years later founded Compañía de Productos Marinos S.A. The plant operated for several years.

==Tourism==
Cabo San Lucas has become a prominent vacation and spa destination, with a variety of sites of interest and timeshares that have been built on the coast between San Lucas and San José del Cabo. The distinctive Arco de Cabo San Lucas at Lands End is a local landmark.

Cabo San Lucas has the highest-paying marlin tournament in the world, the Bisbee&#x27;s Los Cabos Offshore. This tournament takes place every year in the month of October.

In the winter, pods of whales can be observed in the area. They bear their calves in the warm waters of the Gulf of California after traveling up to from Alaska and Siberia.

===Development===
The beaches, surfing, and sport fishing opportunities in Cabo San Lucas have attracted a great number of Mexican natives and foreigners to spend their vacations in large-scale tourist developments. The development of Cabo&#x27;s tourism industry was prompted by the Mexican government&#x27;s development of infrastructure to turn Cabo San Lucas into a major centre for tourism in Mexico, beginning in 1974. Upon completion of the Transpeninsular Highway, also known as the Mexican Federal Highway 1, tourist developments in Los Cabos proceeded relatively unchecked.

Until fairly recently, the unique and fragile environment of this part of Mexico was largely unprotected by law, and therefore was subjected to developers acting in concert with government agencies interested only in low-end tourist bonanzas. There is, however, a growing collection of activists and attorneys now involved in preserving many of Baja&#x27;s desert habitats, marine mammals, and stretches of coastline. A number of agencies, including the Gulf of California Conservation Fund and the Centre for Environmental Law in La Paz, are challenging the destruction of wetlands and other ecosystems from Los Cabos to Ensenada. In the face of a growing international public demand for corporate-driven ecological stewardship, higher-end resorts in the Los Cabos area are increasingly sensitive to their environmental impact and are taking initial steps to institute sustainable practices such as reducing water usage and non-recyclable trash output. In 2017, Los Cabos was projected to be one of the leaders in travel in Latin America, many of the developments owed to its increased accessibility with added plane routes from the US and Canada. It is expected that by 2018, 4,000 new sleeping rooms will come online in Cabo, and the increase in tourism will contribute to its growth as a leader in leisure.

=== Transportation ===
Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo are served by Los Cabos International Airport. In 2022, Los Cabos Airport received more than 3.3 million visitors – a more than 20% projected growth when compared to 2021 and a 32% compounded growth over the last five years with 800 thousand more passengers than 2017.

The town is also a popular port of call for many cruise ships. Cabo San Lucas has a small international airfield, which handles air traffic for general aviation flights and air taxi services.

Many tourists get around the area through the numerous local taxis that service the primary parts of Cabo, as well as the corridor and the airport. Another alternative is the bus system which is less expensive than taxis. It costs several pesos and it is mainly used by locals but also available to tourists. As of 2021, Uber is available as a means of transportation in the Los Cabos area.

===Nightlife and activities===
Clubs in Cabo include the Cabo Wabo Cantina, a nightclub owned by rock singer Sammy Hagar, founded originally by him with other members of Van Halen, named after their hit single &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot;. There is also the Baja Brewing Company. The English-language newspaper for Cabo San Lucas, the biweekly &quot;Gringo Gazette&quot;, has news on tourist activities in Cabo San Lucas, San Jose, Todos Santos, La Paz, and the East Cape Baja.

===Resort corridor===
Chileno Bay is one of the most frequented beaches in the Corridor. It is home to tropical fish, sea turtles, invertebrates, and sponges. Snorkelers often visit this beach to observe underwater sea life.

==Climate==
The extreme south of Baja California has a tropical desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;). Even with the thermal amplitude, there are no freezes.

During summer, Cabo San Lucas is cooler than San José del Cabo by about . Sometimes during the summer, when winds blow from the Pacific Ocean instead of the Gulf of California, the differences in temperatures between San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas are higher.

Cabo San Lucas is less rainy than San José del Cabo, although hurricanes can bring heavy rain for long periods. Hurricane Odile made landfall at Cabo San Lucas on 14 September 2014, and caused widespread damage. Due to the position of the city and orography, local summer thunderstorms do not get near enough to bring rain to the town.

The sea temperature experiences lows of in winter, and highs of during the summer months.


==Population==
As of 2015, the population was 81,111 and has experienced very rapid growth and development. It is the third-largest city in Baja California Sur after La Paz and San José del Cabo.

The majority of non-Mexican inhabitants in the community originate from the United States, and along with residents from San José del Cabo they account for 80% of the U.S. population in the state.

<text>Moody Gardens, established in 1986 by The Moody Foundation, is a non-profit attraction in Galveston, Texas, that includes a hotel and a golf course.

Moody Gardens features three main pyramid attractions: the Aquarium Pyramid, which is one of the largest in the region and holds many species of fish and other marine animals; the Rainforest Pyramid, which contains tropical plants, animals, birds, butterflies, reptiles, and a variety of other rainforest animals including free-roaming monkeys and two-toed sloths; and the Discovery Pyramid, which focuses on science-oriented exhibits and activities.

Palm Beach, a seasonal attraction at Moody Gardens, features white sand imported from Florida.

The Palm Beach is mainly open in the summer, with a small water park for children, freshwater lagoons, a lazy river, tower slides, a hot tub, ziplines, and a splash pad play area for children. Moody Gardens also had at one time a RideFilm Theater with motion-based pod seating, the MG 3D Theater features the largest screen in the state of Texas, 4D Special FX Theater, paddlewheel cruise boat, a hotel, golf course and a convention center.

One of the highlights of Moody Gardens is the many dynamic uses for its available space. Many local tourists and business travelers from the city of Houston and around the world visit the Gardens yearly. In 2004, the site debuted its expanded facilities which offers roughly 60,000 square feet of space available for exhibition and business purposes.

The owners commissioned a landscape design from Geoffrey Jellicoe. It is described in &quot;Gardens of the Mind: the Genius of Geoffrey Jellicoe&quot; by Michael Spens (Antique Collectors Club, 1992).

==Aquarium Pyramid==
This blue pyramid, opened in 1999, is approximately 12 stories high. The pools in the pyramid contain approximately 10,000 marine animals, including fish, sharks, seals, and penguins. These animals represent different regions of the sea, including the North Pacific, South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Caribbean. It aims to highlight the importance of conservation of the world&#x27;s oceans.

The exhibit closed for a short period of time for renovations before reopening in 2017. Upon reopening, the Aquarium pyramid featured a 1.5 million gallon tank.

==Rainforest Pyramid==
This clear Rainforest pyramid opened in 1993 and reaches the height of 10 stories. The humid interior simulates the rainforests of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, featuring bat caves, crashing waterfalls, and Mayan Ruins. The multi-level Rainforests of the World project focuses on education, conservation and possible future breeding with new rare and endangered animals. Animals featured in the exhibit include giant Amazon river otters, saki monkeys, ocelots, birds, and reptiles.

==Discovery Pyramid==
The Discovery Pyramid opened in 1997 and features traveling exhibits and the ride film (motion simulator). In May 2015, Moody Gardens added a semi-permanent exhibit to the bottom level of the Discovery Pyramid, the SpongeBob SubPants Adventure ride.

The SpongeBob themed attraction which was the result of collaborative efforts across several companies and displayed 3D animation in conjunction with high-tech audio and visual components. The attraction received national acclaim and was the recipient of an Award for Outstanding Achievement in 2016 by the Themed Entertainment Association.

In 2017, the Discovery Pyramid debuted a 20 by 10 feet LED wall that creates a deeply immersive experience for visitors. The wall was initially slated to be built for 25k capabilities, the environment inside the pyramid was non-conducive for this type of technology and was designed to be LED compatible.

In 2019, the SpongeBob SubPants Adventure was closed and replaced by &quot;20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: An Interactive Adventure&quot;. This interactive 4D film follows a technologically enhanced pufferfish named Deep as he leads the Nautilus submarine through different parts of the ocean as chosen by the audience. Deep is portrayed by a live actor, who voices and controls the character in real time, creating effectively a personalized show for every audience.

In January 2021, the upper level of the Discovery Pyramid featured the exhibition &quot;Jam Remastered: The Science of Music&quot;, an experience that explores the connection between music, science, and mathematics.

==Palm Beach==
Palm Beach was initially opened in 1988 as the first attraction of Moody Gardens. The white sand used in the construction of the Palm Beach attractions was imported from the coastal beaches of the Florida peninsula.

Palm Beach was later expanded to a full use water park. The water park features &quot;Aquarium Adventure&quot;, a group of slides with a dump bucket, a wave pool, a lazy river, &quot;Tower Slides&quot; (two water slides), and &quot;Splashpad&quot;, the toddler section of the water park. The artificial beach is made with white sand and is situated adjacent to, but not connected to Galveston Bay.

==Zip line and ropes course==

In May 2014, Moody Gardens opened the tallest steel ropes course on the Gulf Coast. The five-tier Sky Trail Ropes Course (or &quot;challenge course&quot;) is five stories tall – standing at tall – and features 48 obstacles (or &quot;elements&quot;) with the obstacles gradually getting harder with each tier. The Moody Gardens Zip Line is long and is connected to another steel tower located at the far end of Palm Beach next to the wave pool – suspending visitors above Palm Beach, allowing them to get a bird&#x27;s eye view of the Moody Gardens pyramids and tropical gardens. The ropes course and zip line was manufactured, installed, and is serviced by Ropes Courses Inc. The ropes course and zip line is open year-round during the weekend and the weekdays during school holidays and the weekday evening during Festival of Lights.

Moody Gardens also features the Sky Tykes Ropes Course for those under tall. It has nine obstacles (or &quot;elements&quot;) and is situated on one level. The open course design allows for easy parent participation for any level of assistance needed. Parents can also walk alongside their child.

Each participant (adult and child) is outfitted with a full body harness and a safety lanyard or sling line. This unique system also allows participants to choose their path through the course while going at their own pace with the ability to pass other participants at each platform.

==Golf course==
In 2007, the Moody Foundation signed an agreement with the City of Galveston to completely rebuild the city&#x27;s municipal golf course. The course reopened in June 2008 under the moniker Moody Gardens Golf Course. The $17 million comprehensive renovation, included the addition of new turf grass, green complexes, elevations, irrigation, drainage, cart paths, greens and a full clubhouse renovation.

The new course was designed by Peter Jacobsen of Jacobsen Hardy Golf Course Design and was constructed to keep historical features of the course while improving certain holes and course flow. The par 72 course measures 6,900 yards from the back tees, with five sets of tees to accommodate all playing abilities.

<doc id="470666" wikidata="Q550619" url="?curid=470666" title="Music Canada">
<text>Music Canada is a non-profit trade organization that was founded 9 April 1963 in Toronto to represent the interests of companies that record, manufacture, produce, and distribute music in Canada. It also offers benefits to some of Canada&#x27;s leading independent record labels and distributors. It was known as the Canadian Record Manufacturer&#x27;s Association () until 1972 and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) () until 2011.

==History==
Originally formed as the 10-member Canadian Record Manufacturer&#x27;s Association, the association changed its name to Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in 1972 and opened membership to other record industry companies.

In 2006, a number of smaller labels resigned their memberships, complaining that the organization was not representing their interests. On 7 July 2011, the CRIA changed its name to Music Canada, and began offering special benefits to some of the leading independent labels and distributors.

==Organization==
Music Canada is governed by a board of directors who are elected annually by association members. To be eligible for election a candidate for the board must be among the executive officers of the member companies. Patrick Rogers (formerly the Vice President, Corporate Affairs) was named Chief Executive Officer, effective 11 January 2021. Graham Henderson had been president from 15 November 2004 to 28 May 2020; Brian Robertson previously held the position from 1974.
*Class A members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is producing, manufacturing, or marketing sound recordings. These members hold voting rights, and currently consist of the &quot;big four&quot; record labels.
*Class B members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is producing sound recordings. These members pay a $600 annual membership fee but have no voting rights. As of 2007, there were 22 class B members.
*Manufacturing Division members are Canadian individuals or companies whose principal business is manufacturing sound recordings.

==Other services==
Music Canada is responsible for the distribution of ISRC registrant codes within Canada, and also works with the IFPI and RIAA to try to prevent copyright infringement of artists&#x27; work.

==Representation==
Historically, Music Canada has represented all record labels in the country. However, some labels and other industry groups have publicly disagreed with Music Canada and stated that it no longer represents them. In 2006, six well-known &quot;indie&quot; labels including Nettwerk left Music Canada in a dispute over Canadian content rules. They claimed the association was only protecting the interests of &quot;the four major foreign multi-national labels&quot;, referring to EMI, Universal, Sony BMG, and Warner. Other points of contention include Music Canada&#x27;s stance against the blank media tax, their support for digital locks on music, and positions against copyright reform. In 2007, a group of musicians formed the Canadian Music Creators Coalition, claiming &quot;legislative proposals that would facilitate lawsuits against our fans or increase the labels&#x27; control over the enjoyment of music are made not in our names, but on behalf of the labels&#x27; foreign parent companies.&quot;

==Legal actions==
On 16 February 2004, Music Canada applied to the Federal Court to force five major Canadian Internet service providers – Shaw Communications Inc., Telus Corp., Rogers Cable, Bell Canada&#x27;s Sympatico service and Vidéotron – to release the names of 29 people accused of copyright infringement through peer-to-peer file sharing. In April 2005, Vidéotron indicated its willingness to supply customer information to Music Canada.

On 31 March 2004, in the case of &quot;BMG v. John Doe&quot;, Justice Konrad von Finckenstein of the Federal Court of Canada ruled that making music available for download over the Internet was not equivalent to distribution and was thus noninfringing. The Justice compared the peer-to-peer filesharing activities to &quot;having a photocopier in a library room full of copyrighted material&quot; and wrote that there was no evidence of unauthorized distribution presented. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the lower courts ruling denying the disclosure of the customers&#x27; identities, but, in reference to &quot;what would or would not constitute infringement of copyright&quot;, stated: &quot;such conclusions should not have been made in the very preliminary stages of this action, since they would require a consideration of the evidence as well as the law applicable to such evidence after it has been properly adduced, and could be damaging to the parties if a trial takes place.&quot;
The Copyright Board of Canada earlier that year had included downloading music in the list of &quot;private copying&quot; activities for which tariffs on blank media applied. (Private copying is the act of copying music for personal use from a noninfringing source, and is itself noninfringing.)
In 2008, the operators of the isoHunt website filed a motion with the Supreme Court of British Columbia seeking a declaratory judgment affirming the legality of their operation. The motion was denied, and the court ruled a full trial was needed. This decision was appealed by the operators of isoHunt; the appeal was also denied. In late 2009, isoHunt filed a formal suit against Music Canada and the four &quot;major&quot; record labels seeking &quot;declaratory relief to clarify its legal rights.&quot;

Additionally, in October 2008, the four main members of Music Canada were sued by the estate of Chet Baker and several other artists for copyright infringement. The major claims in this lawsuit are as follows:

*That some three hundred thousand works were illegally distributed by the Music Canada&#x27;s members, and
*That they failed to seek proper licensing and distribution agreements with the creators of the aforementioned works, instead placing the works on what is colloquially referred to as a &quot;pending list&quot; (i.e., any payments to be made for the use of the aforementioned works are reserved, pending an agreement with the artists who created the works).

As the standard punitive damages for each act of infringement is set at $20,000, and there are three hundred thousand works on the &quot;pending lists&quot;, Music Canada could have faced punitive damages of a minimum of $6 billion. On 8 November 2011, the suit was settled out of court for over $45 million.

==Certification awards==

===Albums===
===Singles===
Prior to 12 September 2016, Music Canada had different certification levels for physical singles and digital downloads singles. On that date, the digital downloads singles award was discontinued and the singles award consisted of sales numbers for digital downloads and physical singles alike. It also includes streams, where 150 on-demand audio streams from a subscription service equals 1 unit towards certification.
====Certification before September 2016====
*CRIA / Music Canada certified digital download singles (and since 12 September 2016, any singles) applying the most recent certification-levels, even to those titles that are released during the time frame the CRIA had lower certification-levels for digital download singles. One such example is the single &quot;Right Round&quot; by Flo Rida feat. Kesha, which was released in January 2009 when certification-levels for Digital-downloads were 10,000 units for Gold and 20,000 units for Platinum. The CRIA (currently Music Canada) certified it three times Platinum in October 2010, applying the latest certification-levels for sales of 240,000 units.

===RingTone and Music DVD===
Ringtone (singles) certifications and Music DVD certifications were retired on 1 April 2021.

*B One of the first digital singles that was certified with levels of &quot;Gold=20,000 and Platinum=40,000&quot; was &quot;Paralyzer&quot; by Finger Eleven, which was released as a digital track on 6 March 2007.
*C One of the first digital singles that was certified with levels of &quot;Gold=40,000 and Platinum=80,000&quot; was &quot;OMG&quot; by Usher, which was released as a digital track on 30 March 2010.
*D From 2004, the &quot;Big Four&quot; were Universal, Sony, EMI and Warner. EMI was later absorbed by Universal and Sony. In 2018, they collectively controlled over 70% of the market.

<doc id="470672" wikidata="Q2528174" url="?curid=470672" title="Viscount Gort">
<text>Viscount Gort is the title of two peerages in British and Irish history. Gort is a small town in County Galway in the West of Ireland. The original title was in the Peerage of Ireland and is extant. A viscountcy with the same title as the Irish peerage was then conferred in the Peerage of the United Kingdom to a later Lord Gort. This gave the distinguished descendant a subtle personal change of status, whilst preserving the heritage of the older title. The United Kingdom title, however, became extinct on the death of the original recipient, who remains perhaps the most illustrious bearer of the older title to date. A post-World War II unqualified reference to &quot;Lord Gort&quot; will almost always be to the sixth viscount.

==Viscount Gort, Peerage of Ireland==
The title was created in 1816 as an advancement or &#x27;step&#x27; for an existing peer. John Prendergast Smyth had already been created Baron Kiltarton of Gort, in the County of Galway, also in the Peerage of Ireland, in 1810. John Prendergast-Smyth, Viscount Gort and Lord Kiltarton, was the nephew of Sir Thomas Prendergast, 2nd Baronet, and had succeeded to the Prendergast estates on the death of this uncle in 1760 (see Prendergast Baronets, of Gort). He was ineligible to inherit the title of his uncle, but the bequest enabled him to develop the status to merit a title of his own, of a higher degree, and subsequently to advance himself higher in the peerage system. Lord Gort had no sons to inherit his two titles but, unusually, he had been able to secure a special remainder both in 1816 and in 1810, the remainder being in favour of his nephew Charles Vereker, the son of his sister Juliana by her marriage with Thomas Vereker.

On the death of John Prendergast-Smyth in the following year, the Gort viscountcy, plus the barony, passed to the Vereker family according to the special remainder. Charles Vereker, the second Viscount, represented Limerick in the House of Commons and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1824 until his death, in 1842.

John Vereker succeeded his father, both as the third Viscount and as Member of Parliament for Limerick. He was also an Irish Representative Peer in 1865, the year in which he died.

==Viscount Gort, Peerage of the United Kingdom==
John Vereker, the sixth Viscount, was the great-grandson of his namesake. Following the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 the family chose to emigrate and settle in County Durham. This Lord Gort was a distinguished soldier whose personal courage in the First World War was recognised with the highest decoration of the British Empire, the Victoria Cross, plus three further gallantry decorations, before achieving the most senior post in the British Army, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. It was Lord Gort who commanded the BEF in 1939 and his leadership during the disastrous withdrawal from France preserved his reputation at an unhappy time for the nation. He then had another tough appointment, as Governor of Malta in its darkest days, before becoming High Commissioner of British Mandate for Palestine and the Transjordan, itself hardly a rest-cure at this time. His promotion to Field Marshal and the creation of the new Viscountcy at the end of the war was an indicator of his standing as a soldier and imperial administrator. The 1946 title was Viscount Gort, of Hamsterley Hall in the County of Durham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Field Marshal Lord Gort had no living sons and, unlike his own ancestor, did not have a special remainder, so on his death just one month after the creation of the new title, the new viscountcy became extinct, whilst the Irish titles passed to his brother, Standish Vereker.

==The Gort Viscountcy in the modern era==
Standish Vereker inherited the title from his brother the Field Marshal, the Lord Gort mentioned above. He inherited the Irish viscountcy and barony in 1946. The seventh Viscount had been awarded the temporary office of High Sheriff of Durham in 1934, before he gained the peerage.

On his death in 1975, the titles passed to his first cousin once removed downwards, becoming the eighth Viscount: Colin Vereker was the grandson of Hon. Foley Charles Prendergast Vereker, second son of the fourth Viscount. The eighth Lord Gort lived on the Isle of Man, where he preserved the family tradition of public service as a member of the House of Keys, the lower house of the Parliament of the Isle of Man. In 1995, the titles passed to his son Foley Vereker, the ninth Viscount, who also lives on the Isle of Man.

The family seat is The Coach House, near Castletown, Isle of Man.

<text>Abell 2218 is a large cluster of galaxies over 2 billion light-years away in the constellation Draco.

Acting as a powerful lens, it magnifies and distorts all galaxies lying behind the cluster core into long arcs. The lensed galaxies are all stretched along the cluster&#x27;s center and some of them are multiply imaged. Those multiple images usually appear as a pair of images with a third — generally fainter — counter image, as is the case for the very distant object. The lensed galaxies are particularly numerous, as we are looking in between two mass clumps, in a saddle region where the magnification is quite large.

==Gravitational lensing==
Abell 2218 was used as a gravitational lens to discover the most distant known object in the universe as of 2004. The object, a galaxy some 13 billion years old, is seen from Earth as it would have been just 750 million years after the Big Bang.

The color of the lensed galaxies is a function of their distances and types. The orange arc is an elliptical galaxy at moderate redshift (z=0.7). The blue arcs are star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshift (z=1–2.5). There is a pair of images in the lower part of the picture of the newly discovered star-forming galaxy at about redshift 7.

==Dark matter==
Clusters of galaxies such as Abell 2218 have also been used to infer both the amount and distribution of Dark matter.

<doc id="470678" wikidata="Q221242" url="?curid=470678" title="Military Frontier">
<text>The Military Frontier (; , ; ; ) was a borderland of the Habsburg monarchy and later the Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empire. It acted as the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; against incursions from the Ottoman Empire.

The establishment of the new defense system in Hungary and Croatia took place in the 16th century, following the election of Ferdinand I as king. Six districts under special military administration were established in Hungary and Croatia. The Croatian Military Frontier and the Slavonian Military Frontier came under the jurisdiction of the Croatian Sabor and ban. In 1627, they were placed under the direct control of the Habsburg military. For more than two centuries, they would retain complete civilian and military authority over the area, up to the abolition of the Military Frontier in 1881. 

During the 17th century, the territory was expanded towards the East and new sections were created. By then, it stretched from Croatia proper in the west to eastern Transylvania in the east and included parts of present-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania and Hungary. During this period, the defence system was also changed, from a conventional garrison model to one of &#x27;soldier-settler&#x27; communities.

The inhabitants of the area were known as the (or frontiersmen). They were mostly Serbian, Croatian, German, Vlach and other colonists. In exchange for land-grants, religious freedom and favorable tax rates, they colonized the area and served as the bulwark for the monarchy against Ottoman incursions. Germans had been recruited by Hungary in the late 18th century to resettle and develop the Danube River Valley, and became known as Donauschwaben. The military regiments formed by the settlers had a vested reason to stand and fight and were familiar with local terrain and conditions. They soon gained a formidable military reputation.

==Background==

The Ottoman wars in Europe caused the border of the Kingdom of Hungary – and subsequently that of the Habsburg monarchy – to shift towards the northwest. Much of the old Croatian territory either became Ottoman land or bordered the new Ottoman domain.

In 1435, in an attempt to strengthen the defences against the Ottomans and Venice, King Sigismund founded the so-called , a military encampment, each in Croatia, Slavonia and Usora. In 1463 King Matthias Corvinus founded the &quot;banovina&quot; of Jajce and Srebrenik, and in 1469 the military captaincy of Senj, modeled after the Ottoman captaincies in the Province of Bosnia. All these actions aimed to improve defence, but ultimately proved unsuccessful. But, they did lead to development of the Pandur infantry and the Hussar cavalry.

Vlachs known as &quot;Martolos&quot; and &quot;Voynuks&quot; were the most dangerous military element under Ottomans, while Vlachs and Serbs which fled from the Ottomans in the 15th century had a similar military tradition which Habsburgs begin to use on their side of the border. They were joined by some Vlachs from Bosnia and thus under the Habsburgs a special system of land ownership and military organization was created ie Military Frontier. This military border was an area of some major war campaigns, but mostly consisted of eternal clashes between the Ottoman Vlachs and the Habsburg Vlachs.

== History ==
=== 16th century ===
After the Croatian Parliament elected the Austrian Habsburgs as kings of Croatia in 1526, Ferdinand I promised the Croatian Parliament that he would give them 200 cavalrymen and 200 infantrymen, and that he would pay for another 800 cavalrymen who would be commanded by the Croatians. Soon the Habsburg monarchy founded another captaincy in Bihać. In the short term, all this was ineffective, as in 1529 the Ottomans swept through the area, captured Buda and besieged Vienna, wreaking havoc throughout the Croatian border areas.

The Habsburgs aimed at holding the Ottoman forces on Hungarian and Croatian territory before they could reach Austria, but did not have a clear defense plan. In the 1530s, significant reinforcements were sent only to the most important forts on the border with the Ottoman Empire. In the 1540s and following the Ottoman campaign of 1552, several conferences were held in which a new defense strategy was adopted. Separate defense zones were to be established in parts of Hungary and Croatia around the border forts. Austrian and Bohemian provinces were obligated to help finance this new system, beginning in the 1550s. At the end of the 1560s, the new border system consisted of around 100–120 forts and extended from the Adriatic Sea to Transylvania. It was organized into six Border Fortress Captain Generalcies ():

# The Croatian and Adriatic Border Fortress Captain Generalcy (), centred initially in Bihać, and from 1579 in Karlovac;
# The Slavonian or Wendish Captain Generalcy (), centred in Varaždin, after 1578 known as the Wendish-Bajcsavár Captain Generalcy;
# The Kanizsa Captain Generalcy (), centred in Kanizsa. Renamed the Captain Generalcy across from Kanizsa () following the loss of Kanizsa in 1600;
# The Györ Captain Generalcy (), protecting Vienna;
# The Captain Generalcy Defending the Mining Towns (), centred in Léva, and in Érsekújvár after 1589;
# The Upper Hungary or Kassa Captain Generalcy (), centred in Kassa.

In addition, there were four District Captain Generalcies ().

From the 1530s, immigration to the Military Frontier began to include a large number of Martolos, Vlach military colonists and other irregulars who were part of the Ottoman military system, they were mostly Christians and some were Muslims.

The new military expenditures became a considerable concern, and the Congress of Inner Austrian lands in Bruck an der Mur in 1578 defined the obligations of each land in covering the military expenses and defined the priorities in improving the defensive strategy. It was determined that the Duchy of Styria will finance the Slavonian and Hungarian Frontiers, and the Duchy of Carniola will finance the Croatian Frontier. The Duchy of Carinthia put their finances at the disposal of Styria and Carniola, to direct the money where needed. In the 2nd half of the 16th century, there were around 20,000 troops stationed in Hungarian and Croatian border forts.

By the end of the 16th century Slavicized Vlachs, other Vlachs and Serbs flee from Ottoman territory to Military Frontier and Dalmatia. At the same time the Croatian Military Frontier became known as the , and from the 1630s the Upper Slavonian Military Frontier was known as the Varaždin . During the 16th and 17th centuries, the military administration of the Frontier was moved away from the Croatian ban and the Sabor (Parliament) and instead instated in the high command of Archduke Charles and the War Council in Graz.

=== 17th century ===
Despite the financial support of the Inner Austrian nobility, the financing of the Military Frontier was not efficient enough. The military leadership in Graz decided to try solutions other than mercenary units. In the 1630s the Imperial Court decided to give land and certain privileges to immigrants into the Frontier (the uskok guerrillas as well as refugees from Ottoman-controlled lands) at the area of Žumberak. In return they would serve in the Imperial army. The remaining local population was also encouraged to remain by receiving the status of free peasants (rather than serfs) and other privileges. These new units were organized into ten or more &quot;voivodeships&quot; per each captaincy.

In 1627, the Military Frontier was removed from the control of the Croatian Sabor and put under direct rule of the Habsburg military. It would have complete civilian and military authority over it until abolition of the Military Frontiers. In November 1630, Emperor Ferdinand II proclaimed the so-called &quot;Statuta Valachorum&quot; (&quot;Vlach Statute&quot;), which regulated the status of so-called Vlach settlers (which included Croats, Serbs and Vlachs) from the Ottoman Empire with regard to military command, their obligations, and rights to internal self-administration. Over time, the population of the Frontier (as it was then) became mixed between the autochthonous Croats and Croatian serfs who had fled the Ottoman territories, and the numerous minority of the Serb and Vlach (who were later assimilated into Croats and Serbs) refugees who strove to expand their rights as a major contributor in the defense of the land. By creating the new military class in the Frontier, the territory of the Frontier eventually became fully detached from the Croatian Parliament and the ban. As freedom of faith was granted to them, they preserved their Orthodox faith in spite of their living in a Catholic country. Eventually, the whole male population of the Military Frontier became professional soldiers who served the Empire on several fronts and through many European wars, even after the relaxation of the Ottoman threat.
During the 17th century territory of the Military Frontier was expanded towards the East and new sections were created. By then, it stretched from Croatia in the west to eastern Transylvania in the east and included parts of present-day Croatia, Serbia, Romania and Hungary. The area was settled primarily with Croatian, Serbian and German colonists (known as &quot;grenzer&quot; and &quot;graničari&quot;) who, in return for land grants, served in the military units defending the empire against Ottomans. The majority of immigrants were Serbs, and some were ethnic Croats, mainly from Bosnia. A large migration of Serbs to Habsburg lands was undertaken by Patriarch Arsenije III Čarnojević. The large community of Serbs concentrated in Banat, southern Hungary, and the Military Frontier included merchants and craftsmen in the cities, but mainly refugees who were peasants.

The 17th century was a relatively peaceful period, during which only smaller raids were made from the Province of Bosnia. After the Ottoman army was repelled at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Great Turkish War ended with much of the former Croatian lands under Habsburg control. Despite this, the Frontier system was retained, and expanded onto former Ottoman territories in Lika, Kordun, Banija, lower Slavonia, Syrmia, Bačka, Banat, Pomorišje, and Transylvania. The Habsburg Empire valued the ability to centrally control the area and to draft cheap and numerous army units.

After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, the Seressaner troops were established with both military and police duties. They were not paid, but were exempted from taxes. Over the following century, each regiment had one section of Seressaners that organized border patrols towards Bosnia, particularly on difficult terrain, and stopped incursions of bandits.

Orthodox Christians who settled Military Frontier from the Ottoman Empire were called in sources as &quot;Vlachs schismatics&quot; and Vlachs or Uskoks, other names which are mentioned are &quot;Valachi seu Rasciani&quot; 
&quot;Valachi seu Serviani&quot;, &quot;Valachi seu Graeci&quot;, Vlachs or Morlachs, &quot;Illirica gens graeci ritus&quot; and &quot;homines Ritus Ruthenici seu Graeci&quot;. During the 17th and first half of the 18th century Catholic natives and Catholics immigrated from Bosnia and Kingdom of Croatia also converted to Orthodoxy. Most documents state that the Vlachs arriving &quot;from Turkey&quot; or &quot;from Bosnia&quot;, ie the Bosnia Eyalet.

===18th century===
When in 1699 and 1718 the lands of Croatia and Hungary returned, which was previously occupied by the Ottomans, the vast majority of that area became the Military Frontier. Throughout the entire region of this frontier various ethnic groups were settled including Croats, Serbs, Albanians and others which were also all together called Vlachs. 
From 1718 to 1739 the Military Frontier also included the Habsburg-controlled northern parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the mid-18th century the Frontier was once again reorganized and modelled after the Imperial army and its regular regiments. In 1737 the Vlach Statute was formally abolished. All previous captaincies and voivodships were discarded, and the area was instead subdivided into general-commands, regiments and companies:
* Varaždin general command
** Križevci regiment
** Đurđevac regiment
* Karlovac general command
** Lika regiment
** Otočac regiment
** Ogulin regiment
** Slunj regiment
* Zagreb general command
** Glina regiment
** Petrinja regiment
* Slavonia general command
** Gradiška regiment
** Brod regiment
** Petrovaradin regiment
* Banat general command
** Serb (Illyrian) section
** German section
** Romanian (Vlach) section
After 1767, every twelfth inhabitant of the Military Frontier was a soldier – in contrast to every 62nd inhabitant in the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Frontier soldiers became a professional military, ready to move to all European battlefields. Due to further immigration of refugees from the Ottoman domain, and to the expansion of the territory to places previously controlled by the Ottomans, the population of the Frontier became even more mixed. There were still many autochthonous Serbs and Croats in Slavonia and in parts of present-day Vojvodina (in Syrmia, Bačka and Banat). However, at this time they became outnumbered by the Serb, Croat and Vlach refugees/immigrants. Some Germans, Poles, Magyars and Slovaks also came to the Frontier, mostly as administrative personnel, and a number of other settlers and military personnel arrived from other parts of the Habsburg Empire – Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Rusyns and others.

In 1783 the Croatian and Slavonian frontiers came under the unified control of the Croatian General Command headquartered in Zagreb.

The Serbian Free Corps of 5,000 soldiers had been established in Banat, composed of refugees who had fled earlier conflicts in the Ottoman Empire. The Corps would fight for the liberation of Serbia and for unification under Habsburg rule. Several &quot;freikorps&quot; operated along the Habsburg-Ottoman frontier. The Austrians used the Corps in two failed attempts to seize Belgrade, in late 1787 and in early 1788.

Serbia was subsequently liberated, and organized into a Habsburg protectorate. On 8 October 1789 Ernst Gideon von Laudon took over Belgrade. Austrian forces occupied Serbia, and many Serbs fought in the Habsburg free corps, gaining organizational and military skills. By 1791, however, the Austrians were forced into withdrawal across the Danube and Sava rivers, joined by thousands of Serb families who feared Ottoman persecution. The Treaty of Sistova (1791) ended the Austro-Turkish War of 1787.

In 1787 the civil administration became separate from the military, but this was reversed in 1800.

===19th century===
By the end of the 18th century, it had already become apparent for some time that the Ottomans were on the decline and were not likely to attempt any further invasions north of the Sava River. The Military Frontier thus began to outlive its usefulness. In 1848, Josip Jelačić, Ban of Croatia, became the commander of the Military Frontier. He pressed for the unification of Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, and the Croatian-Slavonian Frontier. Although he did not have the power to abolish it, he secured approval for reforms and in 1848 the Military Frontier sent representatives to the Croatian Sabor, however, this was revoked in the 1850s. From 1850 the Frontier, Croatia and Slavonia formally constituted a single land, but with separate administration and representation. The whole area of Military Frontier was under military administration. All population, regardless of age and sex, belonged to the army and was subject to austrian military legislation. The Main Command had its headquarters in Zagreb, but remained directly subordinate to the Ministry of War in Vienna.
The Croatian Parliament made numerous pleas to demilitarize the Frontier after the Turkish wars subsided. The demilitarization began in 1869 and on 8 August 1873, under Franz Joseph, the Banat Frontier was abolished and incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, while part of the Croatian Frontier (Križevci and Đurđevac regiments) was already incorporated into Croatia-Slavonia on 1 August 1871. The decree in which the rest of the Croatian and Slavonian frontiers were incorporated into Croatia-Slavonia was proclaimed on 15 July 1881, while incorporation began on 1 August 1881, when Ban of Croatia Ladislav Pejačević took over from the Zagreb General Command.

== Legacy ==
Many Serbs emigrated to the north toward the southern regions of Hungary during the period when the territory of Serbia was largely under Ottoman rule. In order to attract Serbs into Hungary, emperor Leopold I decreed that they would be allowed to elect their own ruler, or &quot;Vojvoda,&quot; from which the name &quot;Vojvodina&quot; derives. In 1690, about 30,000 to 70,000 Serbs settled eastern Slavonia, Bačka and Banat in what became known as the Great Serbian Migrations. Later the Habsburgs did not allow Serbs to elect their own vojvoda; they incorporated the region into the military frontiers of eastern Slavonia and the Banat. However, the strong Serb presence in the region resulted in Vojvodina serving as the cradle of the Serbian renaissance during the 19th century.

From October 1990, eight months before Croatia declared independence (June 25, 1991) from Yugoslavia, the Serbs who lived in the region of the former Military Frontier (Vojna Krajina) started an insurrection and adopted the name (Krajina) for their unrecognised &quot;Republic of Serbian Krajina&quot;. The occupied territory was virtually identical to the Military Frontier&#x27;s territory, however also including some territories that were never a part of former Military Frontier, such as northern Dalmatia with town of Knin. Other territories that had constituted the Military Frontier remained under control of Republic of Croatia. Croatian forces regained control over Serb occupied territories after Operation Storm in 1995 (see the Croatian War of Independence for more information).

<doc id="470685" wikidata="Q1136871" url="?curid=470685" title="Four Thirds system">
<text>The Four Thirds System is a standard created by Olympus and Eastman Kodak for digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR) design and development. Four Thirds refers to both the size of the image sensor (4/3&quot;) as well as the aspect ratio (4:3). The Olympus E-1 was the first Four Thirds DSLR, announced and released in 2003. In 2008, Olympus and Panasonic began publicizing the Micro Four Thirds system, a mirrorless camera system which used the same sensor size; by eliminating the reflex mirror, the Micro Four Thirds cameras were significantly smaller than the Four Thirds cameras. The first Micro Four Thirds cameras were released in 2009 and the final Four Thirds cameras were released in 2010; by that time, approximately 15 Four Thirds camera models had been released by Olympus and Panasonic in total. The Four Thirds system was quietly discontinued in 2017, six years after the final cameras were released.

The system provides a standard that permits interoperability of digital cameras and lenses made by different manufacturers. Proponents describe it as an open standard, but companies may use it only under a non-disclosure agreement.

Unlike older single-lens reflex (SLR) systems, Four Thirds was designed from the start for digital cameras. Many lenses are extensively computerised, to the point that Olympus offers firmware updates for many of them. Lens design has been tailored to the requirements of digital sensors, most notably through telecentric designs. 

The image sensor format, between those of larger SLRs using &quot;full-frame&quot; and APS-C sensors, and smaller point-and-shoot compact digital cameras, yields intermediate levels of cost, performance, and convenience. The size of the sensor is smaller than most DSLRs and this implies that lenses, especially telephoto lenses, can be smaller. For example, a Four Thirds lens with a 300 mm focal length would cover about the same angle of view as a 600 mm focal length lens for the 35 mm film standard, and is correspondingly more compact. Thus, the Four Thirds System has crop factor (aka focal length multiplier) of about 2, and while this enables longer focal length for greater magnification, it does not necessarily aid the manufacture of wide angle lenses.

==History==
Kodak and Olympus announced in February 2001 they would share digital camera technologies; Olympus committed to purchase high-resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors which would be jointly developed by the two companies and manufactured by Kodak. A few months later, an internal Kodak presentation revealed that Olympus was developing a DSLR using Kodak&#x27;s KAF-C5100E 5.1 megapixel 4/3&quot; sensor, with a tentative schedule to announce the camera at the 2002 Photo Marketing Association exposition; Olympus confirmed they were developing a &quot;concept camera&quot; with that sensor size.

The Four Thirds System was announced jointly by Olympus and Kodak at photokina in September 2002. The first camera was the Olympus E-1, announced on June 24, 2003, and aimed at the professional market, with shipments to commence in September. In February 2004, Olympus announced that Panasonic, Sanyo, and Sigma Corporation had joined the consortium. The second Four Thirds DSLR, the Olympus E-300, was introduced that year, without the typical protrusion on the top deck, as the designers had chosen to use a &quot;porro finder&quot; which had four mirrors instead of a standard pentaprism, similar to the design of the viewfinder used in the Olympus Pen F half-frame film SLR.

In 2006, Olympus and Panasonic announced they had collaborated on the design of a new sensor, branded Live MOS, using a body design similar to that of the E-300; the result was three similar cameras, sold as the Olympus E-330, Panasonic DMC-L1, and Leica Digilux 3. Nearly all of the successive Four Thirds camera models would use sensors from Panasonic, with the sole exception of the Olympus E-400 (2006), which was equipped with a CCD but sold only in Europe.

=== Micro Four Thirds System ===

In August 2008, Olympus and Panasonic introduced a new format, Micro Four Thirds.

The new system uses the same sensor, but removes the mirror box from the camera design. A live preview is shown on either the camera&#x27;s main liquid-crystal display or via an electronic viewfinder, as in digital compact cameras. Autofocus may be accomplished via a contrast detection process using the main imager, again similar to digital compact cameras. Some Olympus and Panasonic manufactured camera bodies also feature phase detection auto focus built into the sensor. The goal of the new system was to allow for even smaller cameras, competing directly with higher-end point-and-shoot compact digital cameras and DSLRs. The smaller flange focal distance allows for more compact normal and wide angle lenses. It also facilitates the use, with an adapter, of lenses based on other mounting systems, including many manual focus lenses from the seventies and eighties.

In particular, Four Thirds lenses can be used on Micro Four Thirds bodies with an adapter; however, &quot;all of the functions of the Micro Four Thirds System may not always be available.&quot;

With the emphasis shifted to the Micro Four Thirds system, member companies began discontinuing manufacturing and support for Four Thirds system products. The final Four Thirds camera, the Olympus E-5, was released in 2010. In 2013, Olympus released the Olympus E-M1, which is a Micro Four Thirds camera with enhanced support for legacy Four Thirds lenses using on-chip phase detection autofocus. Olympus discontinued production of the &quot;Zuiko Digital&quot; lenses for Four Thirds in 2017.

==Design==
The standard for the lens mount is described in US Patent 6,910,814.

=== Sensor size and aspect ratio ===

The name of the system stems from the size of the image sensor used in the cameras, which is commonly referred to as a &quot;4/3&quot; type&quot; or &quot;4/3 type&quot; sensor. The common inch-based sizing system is derived from vacuum image-sensing video camera tubes, which are now obsolete. The imaging area of a Four Thirds sensor is equal to that of a video camera tube of 4/3 inch diameter.&lt;ref name=&#x27;Olympus-Europe 4/3&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The usual size of the sensor is 18 mm × 13.5 mm (22.5 mm diagonal), with an imaging area of 17.3 mm × 13.0 mm, giving a diagonal of  mm. The sensor&#x27;s area is about 30–40% smaller than APS-C sensors used in most other DSLRs, but still around 9 times larger than the 1/2.5&quot; sensors typically used in compact digital cameras. Incidentally, the imaging area of a Four Thirds sensor is almost identical to that of 110 film.

The emphasis on the 4:3 image aspect ratio sets Four Thirds apart from other DSLR systems, which usually adhere to the 3:2 aspect ratio of the traditional 35mm format. However, the standard only specifies the sensor diagonal, thus Four Thirds cameras using the standard 3:2 aspect ratio would be possible; notably newer Panasonic Micro Four Thirds models even offer shooting at multiple aspect ratios while maintaining the same image diagonal. For instance, the Panasonic GH1 uses a multi-aspect sensor designed to maximize use of the image circle at 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9; each ratio having a diagonal of 22.5 mm.

Sensor aspect ratio influences lens design. For example, many lenses designed by Olympus for the Four Thirds System contain internal rectangular baffles or permanently mounted &quot;petal&quot; lens hoods that optimise their operation for the 4:3 aspect ratio.

In an interview John Knaur, a Senior Product Manager at Olympus, stated that &quot;The FourThirds refers to both the size of the imager and the aspect ratio of the sensor&quot;. He also pointed out the similarities between 4:3 and the standard printing size of 8×10 as well as medium format 6×4.5 and 6×7 cameras, thus helping explain Olympus&#x27; rationale on choosing 4:3 rather than 3:2.

=== Advantages ===
*The smaller sensor size makes it possible to produce smaller, lighter camera bodies and lenses. In particular, the Four-Thirds system allows the development of compact, large aperture lenses. Lenses with equivalent field of view for larger sensor formats tend to be larger, heavier and more expensive.
* Telecentric optical path means that light hitting the sensor is traveling closer to perpendicular to the sensor, resulting in brighter corners, and improved off-center resolution, particularly on wide angle lenses.
* Because the flange focal distance is shorter than those of legacy film SLR lens mounts, such as Canon FD, Canon EF, Nikon F, Olympus OM, and Pentax K, lenses for many other SLR types may be fitted to Four Thirds cameras using simple mechanical adapter rings. Such mechanical adapter rings typically require manual setting of focus and aperture.

=== Disadvantages ===
* Compared to a larger sensor with equivalent pixel count, a Four Thirds sensor gathers disproportionately less light per pixel. Not only are the individual photosites smaller, but each loses more of its total area to support circuitry and edge shading than a larger photosite would. With less captured light to work with, each photosite requires additional amplification, with associated higher noise as well as reduced dynamic range. A telecentric lens design can mitigate this problem, but the sensor remains more sensitive to the angle of incoming light, and has more pronounced image corner light falloff.
* The resolution of a sensor is often measured as the total sensor pixel count in megapixels, and this is often a primary decision-making factor in choosing a camera. Smaller sensors are tougher to manufacture with the same pixel count as larger sensors, and place a greater demand on optics, since a lens must achieve greater absolute resolving power to produce an adequate picture on a smaller sensor, compared to a larger sensor of the same pixel resolution. A smaller pixel active area reduces the averaging effect and allows a better sampling of high spatial frequencies, mitigating this problem.
* To get the same angle of view as with a larger sensor, the focal length of the lens used with a Four Thirds sensor needs to be shorter. However, to get the same depth of field and light gathering capability as with a larger sensor, the lens aperture needs to be kept constant. In other words, the focal ratio of the lens must be smaller on the Four Thirds system to give the same depth of field and image noise. Since it is more difficult to produce faster lenses (lenses with smaller focal ratios), it can be difficult or impossible to find a lens that produces as shallow a depth of field, and gathers as much light, as an equivalent lens on larger formats. For instance, a 35mm &quot;full-frame&quot; DSLR can match the depth of field of a Four Thirds camera by closing down the aperture by two stops; but it may be more difficult or impossible for a Four Thirds System to match the shallow depth of field of a 35mm camera using a fast lens.

=== Differences ===
* Most Four Thirds cameras (notably those manufactured by Olympus) use an aspect ratio of 4:3 rather than 3:2; newer models offer cropping to 3:2, but this results in a reduced image diagonal (i.e., the effective crop factor is then 2.08).

==Members and products==
=== Four Thirds System companies ===
As of the 2006 Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show, the Four Thirds consortium consisted of the following companies:
* Fuji
* Kodak
* Leica
* Olympus
* Panasonic
* Sanyo
* Sigma

This does not imply a commitment to end user products by each company. Historically, only Leica, Olympus, and Panasonic have produced bodies. Olympus and Leica/Panasonic have made dedicated Four Thirds lenses, and Sigma makes adapted versions of their &quot;DC&quot; lenses for APS-C format DSLRs. Kodak once sold sensors to Olympus for use in their Four Thirds bodies, but the newer Olympus Four Thirds cameras used Panasonic sensors.

=== Four Thirds System cameras ===
The majority of Four Thirds System cameras and Four Thirds lenses are made by Olympus. Many Four Thirds cameras use &quot;sensor-shift&quot; in-body image stabilization, making the need for image stabilization technology in its lenses unnecessary. All Four Thirds cameras also incorporate an automatic sensor cleaning device, in which a thin glass filter in front of the sensor vibrates at 30 kHz, causing dust to fall off and adhere to a piece of sticky material below. Olympus&#x27; E-system camera bodies are noted for their inclusion of a wide range of firmware-level features and customization, good JPEG engine, and compact size. Because of the smaller format of Four Thirds, the viewfinders tend to be smaller than on comparable cameras.

Manufacture of Four Thirds cameras came to an end after the introduction of the mirrorless Micro Four Thirds format. The models that were marketed include:
=== Four Thirds System lenses ===

The Four Thirds lens mount is specified to be a bayonet type with a flange focal distance of 38.67 mm.

There were 41 lenses made for the Four Thirds System standard, including two that were modified and re-released in approximately 2009 with improved mechanisms but otherwise identical optics.

Before announcing that it would stop production of Four Thirds lenses in early 2017, Olympus produced 24 lenses for the Four Thirds System under their &quot;Zuiko Digital&quot; brand. They are divided into three grades — Standard, High Grade and Super High Grade. High Grade lenses have faster maximum apertures, but are significantly more expensive and larger, and the Super High Grade zooms have constant maximum aperture over the full zoom range; all but the Standard grade are weather-sealed. Lenses within each grade cover the range from wide-angle to super telephoto. The Zuiko Digital lenses are well regarded for their consistently good optics. The following table lists all Zuiko Digital lenses available at the time Olympus stopped Four Thirds production:
Olympus also made 1.4× and 2× teleconverters and an electronically coupled extension tube.

Sigma has adapted 13 lenses for the Four Thirds System, ranging from 10 mm to 800 mm, including several for which no equivalent exists: the fast primes (30 mm and 50 mm ) and extreme telephoto (300–800 mm 5.6). As of 2014 all Sigma lenses for the Four Thirds System have been discontinued.

Leica has designed four lenses for the Four Thirds System: fast and slow normal zooms and a 14–150 mm super-zoom, all with Panasonic&#x27;s image stabilization system, and an unstabilized 25 mm prime. These are manufactured and sold by Panasonic.

An official list of available lenses can be found on Four-Thirds.org web site.

As for the system itself, it was silently discontinued in favor of the Micro Four Thirds System.

<text>The Pan-African Congress (PAC) is a regular series of meetings which first took place on the back of the Pan-African Conference held in London in 1900. 

The Pan-African Congress first gained a reputation as a peacemaker for decolonization in Africa and in the West Indies, and made a significant advance for the Pan-African cause. In the beginning, one of the group&#x27;s major demands was to end colonial rule and racial discrimination. It stood against imperialism and it demanded human rights and equality of economic opportunity. The manifesto given by the Pan-African Congress included the political and economic demands of the Congress for a new world context of international cooperation and the need to address the issues facing Africa as a result of European colonization of most of the continent.

Congresses have taken place in 1919 in Paris; 1921 in Brussels, London and Paris; 1923 in Lisbon and London; 1927 in New York City; 1945 in Manchester; 1974 in Dar es Salaam; 1994 in Kampala; and 2014 in Johannesburg.

== Background ==

Pan Africanism as a philosophy was created as early as the late 1700s, seen through the movements of abolition in both the United States and Britain. British writers and former slaves, Ottobah Cugoano and Olaudah Equiano created the foundations for Pan Africanism in English literature. French speakers, like Léopold Sédar Senghor, created the idea of Négritude. These ideas refuted the inferiority of Black people. Pan Africanists believed that both slavery and colonialism were built on negative attitudes towards people of African descent, which in turn, contributed to racism. African Americans were especially frustrated with their slow progress towards racial equality in the United States.

Trinidadian lawyer, Henry Sylvester Williams created the African Association in 1897 to encourage a sense of Pan African unity in the British Colonies. The African Association published the discrimination and injustices faced by people in the African diaspora. The African Association&#x27;s work led to the First Pan-African Conference held in London in 1900. The conference, which brought together people who were against racism and colonialism, attracted international attention, though it did not lead to political action on these issues. Attendees of the Pan-African Conference discussed the need to preserve Black cultural identity and for the rights of indigenous people to be recognized by colonizers. W. E. B. Du Bois was one of thirty attendees at this conference where he described &quot;the color line&quot; as one of the most important issues of the 20th century. Du Bois&#x27; inclusion at the 1900 conference marked him as a developing leader in the Pan-African movement.

During World War I, African American soldiers fought bravely overseas and people like Du Bois felt that they should not face racial violence when they return to the United States. Black soldiers also faced discrimination in Europe at the hands of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during the fighting. Du Bois described the fighting done by Black Americans as a &quot;debt of blood&quot; and that they deserved reparations for slavery and racial violence. He also believed that ensuring a positive future for Africa would be key to helping all Black people around the world. Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points plan gave Du Bois hope that there would be greater opportunities for Black people politically in a future marked by democratic and anti-colonial values. In addition, Du Bois wanted to oppose the influence of the United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and Marcus Garvey on any potential proceedings. The U.S. saw Garvey and the UNIA as linked to &quot;Moscow&quot; and Black separatism and Du Bois wanted to avoid that connection. Of all groups that were trying to have a voice during the end of WWI, Du Bois believed he could have &quot;positive political influence&quot;.

In December 1918, Du Bois went to France as a representative of the NAACP at the same time the Paris Peace Conference was taking place at the end of WWI. Many majority groups, including Black people in Europe and Africa, felt that the creation of a League of Nations would lead to positive outcomes for them politically and socially. Du Bois wrote to President Wilson and asked to be a delegate for the Peace Conference to speak on behalf of Black people. Du Bois knew that the fate of some African colonies were going to be discussed at the Peace Conference. He hoped that having a conference of Black representatives from around the world would be heard by the European powers and the European public. He wanted to lobby the governments attending the Peace Conference to ensure better treatment for people of color around the world. Du Bois believed that he could &quot;exert some positive political influence on the power-brokers and decision-makers during the Paris Peace Conference.&quot; However, Du Bois was one of many individuals representing various other advocacy groups who also wanted to have a voice at the Peace Conference. Since he was not given permission to speak at the Peace Conference, he decided to create a separate meeting to take place at the same time.

A mass meeting in New York City was held on January 19, 1919, by the NAACP on the future of Africa. At the event, there was wide support for Du Bois to discuss Pan African issues in Paris during the Peace Conference. Speakers at the New York meeting included William Henry Sheppard, Horace Kallen, and James Weldon Johnson.

== 1919 Paris Congress (First) ==
=== Planning ===
On 19 February 1919, the first Pan-African Congress was organized quickly in Paris by W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida Gibbs Hunt, Edmund Fredericks and Blaise Diagne. Diagne served as the president of the Congress with Du Bois the secretary and Gibbs the assistant secretary. Du Bois created a list of groups he wanted to attend to the congress which included countries who had Black citizens, but he also wanted representatives from other countries as well. Du Bois wanted to petition the Versailles Peace Conference held in Paris at that time to make a case for African colonies to become self-ruling. The Pan-African Congress proposed that Germany should be required to turn over its colonies to an international organization rather than other colonial powers. Unlike the International Council of Women, the Pan-African Congress was unable to send delegates to the Peace Conference, nor were members permitted to serve on commissions. Delegates to the Pan African Congress had no &quot;official status&quot; among world governments or organizations.

Diagne was able to get official permission for the Congress to take place in Paris by persuading Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau of its importance. Dates were set for February 12 and 13 to coincide with the birthday of Abraham Lincoln. Funding for the event came from the NAACP and American fraternal organizations. Mary White Ovington and James Weldon Johnson raised money through solicitations of prominent NAACP supporters. Despite the funding received, the conference took place on a very small budget.

Once the event had permission, American officials in Paris, such as Tasker H. Bliss and George Louis Beer became alarmed. Beer, who was the chief colonial expert working for the U.S., believed that Black people could not govern themselves. A series of telegrams described as &quot;urgent&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; began to pass between the United States Department of State and American officials in Paris. The French government even later stated that Clemenceau had never approved of the Congress.

There were 57 delegates representing 15 countries, a smaller number than originally intended because British and American governments refused to issue passports to their citizens who had planned on attending. Representatives of the National Equal Rights League including Madam C. J. Walker and William Monroe Trotter were denied passports. It was reported by the U.S. State Department that the French government did not believe the timing was right for a Pan-African Congress. A &quot;New York&quot; &quot;Call&quot; writer believed that the U.S. was worried it would be embarrassed by discussions of race relations at the Congress in Paris. Many of the delegates who attended did so on short notice, or by getting through on other types of credentials, such as being journalists. Others, like Gibbs, were already in Europe. Du Bois did not invite Black socialists or working class leaders to the Congress.

=== Event ===

Eventually, the Congress took place between February 19 and 21 at the Grand Hotel. There was greater representation from African countries at the First Pan-African Congress than there had been at the 1900 Pan-African Conference. Africa had twelve delegates with three from Liberia. There were 21 delegates representing Caribbean countries and 16 delegates from the U.S. Delegates to the Congress were middle-class and moderate. Nevertheless, Du Bois was able to create the idea of a Pan African Marxism during the event.

The first speech of the Congress was by Diagne, who said that assimilated Black people from America, Britain and France &quot;were far more advanced than indigenous and &#x27;inherently backwards&#x27; Africans. In this capacity, he felt that African countries held by Germany should be transferred to a system similar to the colonial system of France. This speech touched on concerns Black intellectuals from Europe and America felt in being compared to the stereotypes of African people as primitive. It also placed significant value on Black people who had been &quot;civilized&quot; by colonizing powers. For Diagne, Germany should give up their colonies not because colonialism was bad, but because German governance was not good. After Diagne&#x27;s speech, Portuguese representative Alfredo Andrade, praised French democracy and its inclusion of Black people in government. Other representatives to the Pan-African Congress also praised France for having Black representation in politics and good relations with Black people anecdotally. Andrade, Diagne, Gratien Candace, Achille René-Boisneuf, and Joseph Lagrosillière all felt that there was &quot;no room for a diasporan political consciousness because they saw the French Third Republic&#x27;s empire as the best current opportunity for the realization of black rights within their constituencies.&quot; Adherence to a &quot;benevolent&quot; nation was seen as a practical approach to helping improve the lives of Black people they represented.

Liberian delegate, Charles D. B. King, spoke about the importance of developing his country as a free state, emphasizing the importance of a shared African heritage. Because of American support, however, Liberia did not want to agitate against the United States. Helen Noble Curtis gave a speech called &quot;The Use of African Troops in Europe&quot; which described many racist experiences Black soldiers fighting in WWI encountered in hospitals and other institutions. Curtis pleaded for the world to recognize that justice is not separate: it should be the same for all people regardless of skin color. Addie Waites Hunton reminded delegates that it was important to include women in the Pan-African proceedings.

=== Outcomes ===
The congress eventually adopted several resolutions, especially related to people living under colonialism. They advocated for self-determination of African people except where &quot;existing practices were directly contradictory to best established principles of civilization.&quot; It was felt that Africa should be granted home rule and Africans should take part in governing their countries as fast as their development permits until at some specified time in the future. Resolutions were sent to the press in France, Britain and the United States. The Congress recommended the creation of a multi-lingual, international publication, the &quot;Black Review&quot;. It was also expected that delegates would plan for the next Pan-African Congress and that this could be a continuing discussion. Du Bois also hoped for the creation of a world organization, the Pan-African Association.

It was reported that there was little news coverage of the Congress in the French press, but one newspaper in Paris called Du Bois a &quot;disciple of Garvey&quot;. West African colonies under British rule barely reported on the event. However, European press did run information about the Congress in the weeks prior to the event. Black people in the United States &quot;generally approved of the actions of Du Bois as reported in the newspapers.&quot; Paul Otlet, a Belgian peace activist, wrote an article in &quot;La Patrie Belge&quot; proposing that European powers return German colonies to African people. When Du Bois wrote about the Congress in the &quot;Crisis&quot; and in his reports to the NAACP, he did not give a full view of actual nature of the speeches and implied criticism of the United States&#x27; racial problems that did not take place at the conference. Instead, he focused on &quot;black solidarity&quot; over reporting other content of the discussions. One conference attendee, the French Africanist Maurice Delafosse, wrote that the French government was largely tolerant of the ideas expressed at the Congress. Harry F. Worley, a white Virginian working for the U.S. State Department in Paris, expressed greater alarm at the &quot;so-called Pan-African Congress&quot;: he reported that he had heard that &quot;speeches of the American Negroes were highly inflammatory and condemnatory of the social conditions in the United States&quot;.

Du Bois sent a letter to Winston Churchill in 1921, where he enclosed the resolutions adopted at this first Congress in 1919. Du Bois also sent the resolutions to Beer and Edward M. House who served as advisors to President Wilson.

== 1921 Brussels, London and Paris Congress (Second) ==

In 1921, the Second Pan-African Congress met in several sessions in London, Brussels and Paris, during August (28, 29, and 31) and September (2, 3, 5 and 6). As W. E. B. Du Bois reported in &quot;The Crisis&quot; in November that year, represented at this congress were &quot;26 different groups of people of Negro descent: namely, British Nigeria, Gold Coast and Sierra Leone; the Egyptian Sudan, British East Africa, former German East Africa; French Senegal, the French Congo and Madagascar; Belgian Congo; Portuguese St. Thomé, Angola and Mozambique; Liberia; Abyssinia; Haiti; British Jamaica and Grenada; French Martinique and Guadeloupe; British Guiana; the United States of America, Negroes resident in England, France, Belgium and Portugal, and fraternal visitors from India, Morocco, the Philippines and Annam.&quot; There was an Indian revolutionary who took part, Shapurji Saklatvala, and a journalist from the Gold Coast named W. F. Hutchinson who spoke. This session of the Congress was the most focused for change of all the meetings thus far. At the London session, resolutions were adopted, later restated by Du Bois in his &quot;Manifesto To the League of Nations&quot;:

The only dissenting voices were these of Blaise Diagne and Gratien Candace, French politicians of African and Guadeloupean descent, who represented Senegal and Guadeloupe in the French Chamber of Deputies. They soon abandoned the idea of Pan-Africanism because they advocated equal rights inside the French citizenship and thought the London Manifesto declaration too dangerously extreme.

American Helen Noble Curtis acted as the sole representative for Liberia during this conference.

=== Planning ===
In 1920, Du Bois secured 3,000 dollars from the NAACP for the creation of a &quot;Pan-African fund&quot;. He planned to have more African representatives at this event. Paul Panda Farnana introduced Du Bois to colonial leaders in Brussels. Imperial and colonial powers were worried about the American delegates supporting radical and revolutionary ideas.

=== Event ===
The London meeting took place in Methodist Central Hall, Westminster and the Paris meeting happened at the Salles des Ingènieurs. The Brussels sessions were hosted at the Palais Mondial. The Congress met on August 28 and 29 at the Central Hall with around 113 people in attendance and 41 delegates.

=== Outcomes ===
The press in the British colony of the Gold Coast completely denounced the entire 1921 Congress. The Belgian press targeted Garvey and links to the UNIA and the Congress due to &quot;fears of disruption in the Congo&quot;. This led to fears among businesses and the government in Brussels that the Congress would be a radical event that would advocate for the overthrow of colonial rule. Panda Farnana even tried suing the newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Avenir Colonial Belge&quot;, to court for &quot;having smeared and discredited the Pan-African Congress.&quot; The smear campaign made many in Brussels see the meeting as a &quot;gathering of dangerous agitators who, like their leader Marcus Garvey, were bent on freeing Africa from European rule.&quot; However, Garvey saw the Congress as little more than a joke and sharply criticized it and Du Bois loudly and publicly.

=== Delegates ===
* Anna J. Cooper.
* Addie E. Dillard.
* Amy Jacques Garvey.
* George Rubin Hutto, United States.
* Rayford Logan, United States.
* Albert Marryshow, Grenada.

== 1923 Lisbon and London Congress (Third) ==

In 1923, the Third Pan-African Congress was held in London and in Lisbon. Helen Noble Curtis was an important planner of the Lisbon event, which was smaller than the others. The London Congress was held at Denison House. This meeting also repeated the demands such as self-rule, the problems in the Diaspora and the African-European relationship. The following was addressed at the meeting:
* The development of Africa should be for the benefit of Africans and not merely for the profits of Europeans.
* There should be home rule and a responsible government for British West Africa and the British West Indies.
* The Abolition of the pretension of a white minority to dominate a black majority in Kenya, Rhodesia and South Africa.
* Lynching and mob law in the US should be suppressed.

Before the Congress met in London, Isaac Béton of the French Committee wrote a letter to Du Bois, telling him that the French group would not be sending delegates. However, in one of the reports he published in &quot;The Crisis&quot;, Du Bois drew on words spoken by Ida Gibbs Hunt and Rayford Logan to imply that the French Committee had sent delegates. As long-time African-American residents of France, Hunt and Logan had traveled independently to the meeting, and Hunt and Béton were perturbed that Du Bois had implied they represented France. Black French people, including Béton and Gratien Candace who resigned from the congress, were worried the event would have &quot;radical tendencies&quot;.

== 1927 New York City Congress (Fourth) ==
=== Planning ===
According to Du Bois, an earlier plan to hold the 4th Congress in the West Indies, specifically Port-au-Prince, in 1925 did not pan out due to transportation and other issues. Instead, the Congress was held in New York City in 1927.

Women played a significant role in this congress. Addie Whiteman Dickerson, Addie Hunton and the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom were key fundraisers for the meeting. The Circle for Peace and Foreign Relations of New York City was also one of the sponsors of the 4th PAC. Beatrice Morrow Cannady, Dora Cole Norman, Dorothy R. Peterson, and Jessie Redmon were all active in planning for the 4th PAC. The Grace Congregational Church served as planning headquarters.

=== Event ===
The opening meeting was held at St. Mark&#x27;s Methodist Church and the Headquarters remained at the Grace Congregational Church. There were about 208 delegates from the United States and other countries. Low attendance from British and French colonies was due to government travel restrictions.

William Pickens gave a speech on the importance of worker solidarity during the opening session. Other speakers at the opening session included Chief Nana Amoah, Reginald G. Barrow, Dantès Bellegarde, James Francis Jenkins, H. K. Rakhit, Adolph Sixto, and T. Augustus Toote. Later speeches were given by W. Tete Ansa, Helen Noble Curtis, Du Bois, Leo William Hansbury, Leslie Pinckney Hill, Georges Sylvain, and Charles H. Wesley. The final speeches of the congress were given by H. H. Philips, Rayford Logan, and Y. Hikada on politics in Africa.

Committees were formed during the event, including the creation of a resolution committee headed by Bellegarde, Cannady, Du Bois, Hunton, and Reverdy C. Ransom.

=== Outcomes ===
The Fourth Pan-African Congress was held in New York City adopted resolutions that were similar to the Third Pan-African Congress meetings. Resolutions called for the liberation of various colonized countries, including Haiti, China, and Egypt. A call for working class solidarity across racial lines was also included, but no plans for how to accomplish this were made.

=== Delegates ===
There were 208 delegates from the United States and 10 different foreign countries. Africa was represented by delegates from the Gold Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.
* Dantès Bellegarde, Haiti.
* Anna J. Cooper.
* Amy Jacques Garvey.
* Rayford Logan.
* Richard B. Moore, American Negro Labor Congress.

== 1945 Manchester Congress (Fifth) ==

Following the foundation of the Pan-African Federation (PAF) in Manchester in 1945, the Fifth Pan-African Congress was held at the Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall, Manchester, United Kingdom, between the 15 and 21 October 1945.

Although forming a part of a larger Pan-African movement at the beginning of the century, this event was organised by people in Manchester, and they brought in the people from all over the world.&quot; While the previous four congresses had involved predominantly members of the African diaspora, including those in the United Kingdom, Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans.&quot; the fifth included more representatives from the African continent.

It was the wish of the West African Students&#x27; Union that the event be hosted in Liberia and not in Europe, however having originally been scheduled in Paris to coincide with the 1945 World Trade Union Conference, it was switched to August in Manchester. The Conference took place in a building decorated with the flags of the three black nations under self-governance at the time Ethiopia, and Liberia and the Republic of Haiti.

The Fifth Congress had a larger profile than the first four PACs. At the end of World War II, around 700 million people lived under imperial rule and were &#x27;subject people&#x27;, with no freedoms, no parliaments, no democracy, and no trade unions to protect workers. Many felt betrayed after being promised movement towards self-government if they fought for European colonial powers during the First World War – only to have such promises later denied so a new militancy had emerged with demands for decolonization as well as condemning imperialism, racial discrimination, and capitalism.

=== Planning ===
Planning began in 1944 after Du Bois corresponded with Amy Jacques Garvey and Harold Moody on an idea for an &quot;African Freedom Charter&quot;. This correspondence led to Du Bois calling for a fifth Pan African Congress to be held in London. Du Bois was unaware that George Padmore had also called for a Pan African Congress to be held after WWII, but once he found out, he was interested in working with Padmore. Additional plans were made with the NAACP, and the congress was tentatively scheduled for Paris at the same time as the World Trade Union Conference. Plans changed again in August 1945, when Du Bois announced that the fifth PAC would be held in England, one week after the trade union conference.

=== Attendees ===
There was a much greater representation of African delegates and attendees from Continental Africa at this conference. Marika Sherwood notes that &quot;There were also eleven listed &#x27;fraternal delegates&#x27;, from Cypriot, Somali, Indian and Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) organisations, as well as the Women&#x27;s International League and two British political parties, the Common Wealth Party and Independent Labour Party&quot;. Historian Saheed Adejumobi writes in &quot;The Pan-African Congresses, 1900–1945&quot;  that &quot;while previous Pan-African congresses had been controlled largely by black middle-class British and American intellectuals who had emphasized the amelioration of colonial conditions, the Manchester meeting was dominated by delegates from Africa and Africans working or studying in Britain.&quot; Adejumobi notes that &quot;the new leadership attracted the support of workers, trade unionists, and a growing radical sector of the African student population. With fewer African American participants, delegates consisted mainly of an emerging crop of African intellectual and political leaders, who soon won fame, notoriety, and power in their various colonized countries.&quot; Among attendees were Hastings Banda, Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta who would go on to be the first presidents of their newly independent countries. Commentators estimate that 87–90 delegates were in attendance at the Congress, representing some 50 organisations, with a total of 200 audience members present. While Nnamdi Azikiwe did not attend the conference, he is on the record saying how important it was for the momentum of independence movement at the time.

=== Issues addressed ===
Among the issues addressed at the conference were:
* &quot;The Colour Problem in Britain&quot;, Including issues of unemployment among black youth; abandoned mixed-race children fathered by black ex-servicemen and white British mothers; racial discrimination, the colour bar and discriminatory employment practices. These topics were discussed at the first session of the Congress held on October 15, 1945, chaired by Amy Ashwood Garvey.
* &quot;Imperialism in North and West Africa&quot;. All present demanded independence for African nations; delegates were split on the issue of having political emancipation first or control of the economy. Kwame Nkrumah advocated for revolutionary methods of seizing power as essential to Independence. From this session onwards the chair was taken by Dr W. E. B. Du Bois.
* &quot;Oppression in South Africa&quot;. Including the social, economic, educational, health and employment inequalities faced by Black South Africans. All present expressed support and sympathy which included a number of demands outlined.
* &quot;The East African Picture&quot;. Focusing on the issue of land, most of the best land had been occupied by White settlers; working conditions and wages for Africans reflected the same inequalities as South Africa. This session was open by Jomo Kenyatta.
* &quot;Ethiopia and The Black Republics&quot;. Discussing the issue of Britain exercising control over Ethiopia although Emperor Haile Selassie had been restored to the throne; the United Nations not offering help to Ethiopia while Italy (which conquered Ethiopia in 1935 under a fascist regime) was receiving UN help.
* &quot;The Problems in the Caribbean&quot; This session was addressed by a number of trade union delegates from the Caribbean; some delegates demanded &quot;complete independence&quot;, some &quot;self-government&quot; and others &quot;dominion status&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s contributions ===
Women played an important role in the Fifth Congress. Amy Ashwood Garvey chaired the opening session and Alma La Badie, a Jamaican member of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, spoke about child welfare. Women also supported in behind-the-scenes roles, organising many of the social and other events outside the main sessions. Historians Marika Sherwood and Hakim Adi have specifically written about women involved in the Fifth-Congress.

=== Reception ===
The British press scarcely mentioned the conference. However, &quot;Picture Post&quot; covered the 5th Pan African Congress in an article by war reporter Hilde Marchant titled &quot;Africa Speaks in Manchester&quot;, published on 10 November 1945. &quot;Picture Post&quot; was also responsible for sending John Deakin to photograph the event.

=== Outcomes ===
This conference shifted the discussion about Pan-Africanism to focus more on African leaders and the people of Africa as &quot;primary agents of change in the anti-colonial and anti-imperial struggles.&quot; Du Bois attempted to enlist the NAACP into further support for Pan-Africanism and aid to Africa, but the results were tepid. Du Bois continued to work towards the creation of a Pan-African movement in the United States throughout 1946. Due to the Red Scare, the NAACP stepped back from its support of Pan Africanism.

=== Commemoration ===
* Red Commemorative plaque. It is suggested by commentators that Manchester community leader and political activist, Kath Locke, persuaded Manchester City Council to place a red plaque commemorating the Congress on the wall of Chorlton Town Hall.
* &quot;Black Chronicles III: The Fifth Pan African Congress&quot;. Autograph ABP hosted the first exhibition showcasing John Deakin&#x27;s photographs from the Fifth Congress. The exhibition marked the 70th anniversary of the Congress in 2015 and included film screenings exploring Pan-African history and ideals curated by June Givanni.
* &quot;Pan African Congress 50 years on&quot;. The project interviewed attendees of the 1945 Pan African Congress who were still living in Manchester in 1995. The project was part of the 50th commemorative event held in Manchester in 1995.
* &quot;PAC@75&quot;. Manchester Metropolitan University held a four-day celebration in October 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of the 5th Pan-African Congress. Curated by Professor of Architecture Ola Uduku, the anniversary celebrations involved both creative and academic events.
* Archive material relating to the 1945 and the subsequent celebratory events in 1982 and 1995 are held at the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre at Manchester Central Library. Len Johnson&#x27;s papers at the Working Class Movement Library has records and documents from the 1945 Congress.

== 1974 Dar es Salaam Congress (Sixth) ==
The sixth Pan-African Congress, also known as &quot;Sixth-PAC or 6PAC&quot;, was hosted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in June 1974. This was the first time the event took place in Africa. The event was originally proposed by Pauulu Kamarakafego to challenge neocolonialism and apartheid.

=== Planning ===
Activists involved in the Washington, D.C. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) were involved in organizing and hosting the congress. Charlie Cobb, Courtland Cox, and James Garrett, who were involved with the SNCC, helped plan the event. C. L. R. James played a role influencing the congress. Other key organizers included Geri Stark Augusto, Judy Claude, Julian Ellison, Kathy Flewellen, Sylvia I. B. Hill, Loretta Hobbs, and James Turner. Flewellen and Hill, who served on the international secretariat, conducted meetings to select delegates for 6PAC. Hill organized the North American delegates, focusing on ways that the Black community could work together to pool resources to aid in the Pan-African movement. David L. Horne organized delegates from southern California.

James traveled to Tanzania to talk to Cox and Mwalimu Nyerere about hosting the congress there. During the planning, the radical non-governmental delegation from the Caribbean, which included members of the Afro-Caribbean Liberation movement, the New Jewel Movement, and the African Society for Cultural Relations with Independent Africa (ASCRIA), chose not to attend 6PAC. In solidarity, James also boycotted the congress despite &quot;appeals from Julius Nyerere to attend.&quot;

Augusto and Edie Wilson moved to Dar es Salaam in 1973 where they served as the head of the International Secretariat for 6PAC. Planners had to decided whether 6PAC would pick up right where the 5th congress left off, which meant recommitting to opposing various forms of colonialism still present in Africa. Focusing on colonialism and imperialism was an important decision because it was possible that it could alienate Caribbean governments and delegates from the United States.

=== Event ===
Hundreds to thousands of participants met at the University of Dar es Salaam from June 19 to June 27, 1974. Around 50 different sovereign governments and political organizations sent delegates to 6PAC. Delegates from liberation movements from several colonized countries also attended.

Hill served as the secretary general for North America. It was part of the original planning that groups working towards liberation have time to network and &quot;build international solidarity&quot;. Activists such as Mae Mallory, Queen Mother Moore, Brenda Paris, and Florence Tate all attended 6PAC. For Black British activists Zainab Abbas, Gerlin Bean, Ron Phillips, and Ansel Wong, attending the conference allowed them to express the solidarity of the Black activists in Britain with anti-colonialists activists in the rest of the world. A highlight of the conference was the resolution on Palestine, which was the congress&#x27; formal recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.

The opening address was given by Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. His speech focused on promoting &quot;nonracialism&quot; at the congress because it is more important for all people to work together to free themselves from oppression in Africa.

Event planners also hoped that the Congress would support the creation of a Pan African Center of Science and Technology. Several men associated with Howard University, Neville Parker, Don Coleman, and Fletcher Robinson, all worked towards the development of a Pan African Center of Science and Technology during the congress. However, there was not enough support for the plan and it didn&#x27;t make the final resolution.

=== Reception ===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the Congress was very divided and often too &quot;militant&quot;.

=== Outcomes ===
A General Political Statement was created at 6PAC which called for an end to all forms of colonialism, including neocolonialism. The statement also called for a unification of African people to work towards socialism throughout Africa to end oppression. It explicitly called out all kinds of racism and nationalism.

Augusto stayed in Dar es Salaam after 6PAC to edit the proceedings of the event for the Tanzania Publishing House.

Several North American activists from the 6PAC went on to Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1974 to lobby the United States to take action against apartheid in South Africa. Under Hill&#x27;s leadership, this grew into the Southern Africa News Collective, and eventually in 1978 turned into the Southern Africa Support Project (SASP).

=== Attendees ===
* Anna J. Cooper
* Amy Jacques Garvey

== 1994 Kampala Congress (Seventh) ==
The seventh Pan-African Congress was held in Kampala, Uganda from April 3 to April 8, 1994. The theme of the event was &quot;Facing the Future in Unity, Social Progress and Democracy.&quot;

=== Planning ===
The seventh Pan African Congress was called by the Pan-African Movement of Nigeria who hoped to hold the event in Lagos. This group, however, wanted to limit attendance only to &quot;African people&quot;, not Arab or white Africans.

=== Event ===
There were more than 2,000 participants at the event, which included a Women&#x27;s Pre-Congress meeting. Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, spoke at the opening of the congress, where he listed five criteria for defining who is an &quot;African&quot;. The criteria, which included people of many backgrounds and nationalities, helped define &quot;African&quot; as something that was not just a racial category. In addition, 7PAC brought together activists from different generations to work on modern problems together. Modern issues included HIV/AIDS in Africa, women&#x27;s rights, and globalization. Other tensions to unravel in 7PAC and going forward include Black nationalism, Black Marxism-Leninism and the historical baggage that surrounds both ideas.

=== Delegates ===
* Ronald Muwenda Mutabi, &quot;Kabaka&quot; of Buganda.

== 2014 Johannesburg Congress (Eighth) ==
The eighth Pan-African Congress was held at the University of the Witwatersrand from January 14 to January 16, 2014, in Johannesburg.

<text>Patras ( ; Katharevousa and ; ) is Greece&#x27;s third-largest city and the regional capital and largest city of Western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, west of Athens. The city is built at the foot of Mount Panachaikon, overlooking the Gulf of Patras. 

As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173,600. The core settlement has a history spanning four millennia. In the Roman period, it had become a cosmopolitan center of the eastern Mediterranean whilst, according to the Christian tradition, it was also the place of Saint Andrew&#x27;s martyrdom. 

Dubbed as Greece&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;Gate to the West&quot;&#x27;, Patras is a commercial hub, while its busy port is a nodal point for trade and communication with Italy and the rest of Western Europe. The city has three public universities, hosting a large student population and rendering Patras an important scientific centre with a field of excellence in technological education. The Rio-Antirrio Bridge connects Patras&#x27; easternmost suburb of Rio to the town of Antirrio, connecting the Peloponnese peninsula with mainland Greece.

Every year, in February, the city hosts one of Europe&#x27;s largest carnivals. Notable features of the Patras Carnival include its mammoth satirical floats and balls and parades, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors in a Mediterranean climate. Patras is also famous for supporting an indigenous cultural scene active mainly in the performing arts and modern urban literature. It was European Capital of Culture in 2006.

==History==
For the Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine history of Patras see: History of Patras.
=== Middle Ages and early modern ===
In 1205, the city was captured by William of Champlitte and Villehardouin, and became a part of the principality of Achaea. It became the seat of the Barony of Patras, and its Latin archbishop primate of the principality. In 1408, Patras became Venetian, until it was recaptured in 1430 by the Despotate of Morea and its despot Constantine Palaiologos, who thus succeeded in recovering for the Byzantine Empire the whole of the Morea, apart from Venetian possessions. The administration of Patras was given to George Sphrantzes, while Constantine was immediately contested by the Ottoman Empire and later, in 1449, became emperor of the Byzantine empire.

Patras remained a part of the Despotate of Morea until 1458, when it was conquered by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmet II. Under the Ottomans, it was known as &quot;Baliabadra&quot;, from the (&#x27;Old Patras&#x27;), as opposed to (&#x27;new Patra&#x27;), the town of Ypati in Central Greece. Though Mehmet granted the city special privileges and tax reductions, it never became a major centre of commerce. Venice and Genoa attacked and captured it several times in the 15th and 16th centuries, but never re-established their rule effectively, except for a period of Venetian rule in 1687–1715 after the Morean War.

It has been noted that during and in the aftermath of the suppressed 1770 Orlov revolt &quot;when the Greeks got the upper hand they settled old scores; when the Turks and Albanians reasserted themselves they were merciless: recapturing Patras, they left scarcely anyone alive.&quot;

In 1772, a naval battle took place off the city between the Russians and Ottomans.

=== Modern era ===
Patras was one of the first cities in which the Greek Revolution began in 1821; the Ottoman garrison, confined to the citadel, held out until 1828. After the war, most of the city and its buildings were completely destroyed.

Patras developed quickly into the second-largest urban centre in late-19th-century Greece. The city benefited from its role as the main export port for the agricultural produce of the Peloponnese.

In the early 20th century, Patras developed fast and became the first Greek city to introduce public streetlights and electrified tramways. The war effort necessitated by the First World War hampered the city&#x27;s development and also created uncontrollable urban sprawl after the influx of displaced persons from Asia Minor after the 1922 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. In the Second World War, the city was a major target of Italian air raids. In the Axis occupation period, a German military command was established and German and Italian troops stationed in the city. After the liberation in 1944, the city recovered, but in later years was increasingly overshadowed by the urban pole of Athens. Since 2014, the city&#x27;s mayor is Kostas Peletidis.

== Urban landscape ==
The city is divided into the upper and the lower section, connected with roads and broad stairs. The upper section (&quot;Ano Poli&quot;) is the older and the more picturesque; however, the lower section (&quot;Kato Poli&quot;) is laid out according to the 1858 city plan, featuring a variety of squares. The most notable of these are the &quot;Psila Alonia&quot; and the Georgiou I Square. A number of notable neoclassical buildings are to be found, including the Apollon Theatre in Georgiou I Square, the City Hall, the headquarters of the Local Trade Association and the Court of Justice. A replica of Patras Lighthouse, the city&#x27;s emblematic old lighthouse – which was at the dock of &quot;Ayios Nikolaos&quot; – rises at the end of Trion Navarchon street, near the temple of Saint Andreas.

In general, much of Patras&#x27; coastline is framed by roads and avenues running alongside; these include Dymaion Coast to the south and Iroon Polytechneiou Street to the north.

===Main sights===


Patras and its region is home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments, including the Roman Odeon of Patras, the Fortress of Rio and the Fortress (castle) of Patras. More specifically, the main sights of the city are:

*The Patras Archaeological Museum focuses on the exhibition of various archaeological finds, from the Mycenaean to the Late Roman era, discovered in Patras and the wider Achaea region. The museum is housed in a modern and special architectural building designed by the architect Theophanis Bobotis. 
*The Mycenaean cemetery of Voudeni (Skioessa), from the center of Patras, is one of the most important sites of the Mycenaean world, showing active use for nearly five hundred years (1500–1000 BC). The site itself appears to have been inhabited from the Bronze Age until middle Roman times (1800 BC–AD 400).
*The Roman Odeon, the most significant ancient monument, is in the upper town and was built around 160 AD, in the reign of either Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius. It has been restored and partially reconstructed, and is used as an open-air theatre for performances and concerts in the summer.

===Architecture===


Patra is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were completely destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The oldest surviving buildings (apart from ancient monuments and the castle) are the church of Pantocrator in Ano Poli and a residential building (Tzini&#x27;s house) at the corner of Agiou Nikolaou and Maisonos street, built in 1832. The area on the south of the castle, around the Roman Odeon, the church of Pantokrator, in the Upper Town (Ano Poli), is the most appealing of the city, because of its status as the only area where construction height is limited to two-storey buildings.
Ιn Ano Poli is interesting the old school complex &quot;Georgios Glarakis&quot; work of the architect Georgios Petrιtsopoulos in 1931 which is built with stone and recently became a nice bioclimatic school. At the beginning of the 20th century, outside the school complex &quot;Georgios Glarakis&quot;, line 2 of the tram ended, starting from Agios Dionysios, going up Dimitriou Gounari Street, passing behind the church of Pantanassa, entering Roman Odeon and finished outside the Glarakis school complex.
Historical buildings and mansions of the city, apart Tzini&#x27;s house, include also the Prapopoulos building, Golfinopoulos mansion (&quot;Alhambra&quot;), Perivolaropoulos mansion, Palamas house, while among the demolished after WWII were Tsiklitiras mansion, Kanellopoulos house, Chaidopoulos building, Frangopoulos house, Green mansion and Mineyko mansion.

===Districts and neighbourhoods===


Nowadays, the municipal units of Rio, Paralia, Messatida and Vrachnaiika have functionally become a part of the wider urban complex of Patras. Apart from the city center, the main districts of Patras are:
==Geography==
Patras is west of Athens by road, northeast of Pyrgos, south of Rio, west of Corinth, northwest of Kalavryta and northwest of Tripoli.

A central feature of the urban geography of Patras is its division into upper and lower sections. This is the result of an interplay between natural geography and human settlement patterns; the lower section of the city (Kato Poli), which includes the 19th-century urban core and the port, is adjacent to the sea and stretches between the estuaries of the rivers of Glafkos and Haradros. It is built on what was originally a bed of river soils and dried-up swamps. The older upper section (Ano Poli) covers the area of the pre-modern settlement, around the Fortress, on what is the last elevation of Mount Panachaikon () before the Gulf of Patras.

===Hydrology===
The largest river in the area is the Glafkos, flowing to the south of Patras. Glafkos springs in Mount Panachaikon and its water is, since 1925, collected in a small mountainous reservoir-dam near the village of Souli and subsequently pumped in order to provide energy for the country&#x27;s first hydroelectric plant. Other smaller streams are &quot;Charadros&quot;, &quot;Meilichos&quot;, &quot;Kallinaos&quot;, &quot;Panagitsa&quot; and the mountain torrent &quot;Diakoniaris&quot;.

===Climate===
Patras, like much of Western Greece, has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;). It features the typical mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, with spring and autumn being pleasant transitional seasons. Autumn in Patras, however, is wetter than spring. Humidity is high during the winter months and lower during the summer. Snowfall is extremely rare in coastal areas but is more common and abundant in the surrounding mountains. Patras falls in 10b hardiness zone.

===Ecology===
Of great importance for the biological diversity of the area and the preservation of its climate is the swamp of Agyia, a small and coastal aquatic ecosystem of only , north of the city centre. The main features of this wetland are its apparent survival difficulty, being at the heart of a densely populated urban centre that features a relatively arid climate and its admittedly high level of biodiversity, with over 90 species of birds being observed until the early 1990s, according to a study by the Patras Bureau of the &quot;Hellenic Ornithological Society&quot;.

==Government==

Patras is the regional capital of Western Greece and the capital of the Achaea regional unit. Since 2011, the city is also the capital of the administrative division, which includes (along with Western Greece) the regions of Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands.

===Municipality===
The current municipality of Patras was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of 5 municipalities that made up the Patras Urban Area. These former municipalities, which became municipal units, are: (in parentheses their population, 2011)

*Messatida (13,852)
*Paralia (9,987)
*Patras (170,896)
*Rio (14,034)
*Vrachnaiika (4,627)

The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit .

==Demographics==

From 2011 on, can data also reflect the city&#x27;s urban area population, as all the municipalities that made up the Patras Urban Area were joined to create the new larger Patras municipality, formed at the 2011 local government reform. 
==Infrastructure==

Heavy infrastructure works performed in the 2000s include the Peiros-Parapeiros dam (to provide water supply for Patras and surrounding towns) and a &quot;small industries&quot; park that will be constructed next to the Glaykos river and provide an easy connection with the new port.

The city is one of the main Greek internet and GRNET hubs and is connected with high speed lines to Athens as part of the backbone. A metropolitan optical network will be deployed in the city, with a total length of .

Two major state hospitals operate in the city: the Agios Andreas Hospital is the oldest of the two; and General University Hospital of Patras. There also exists two smaller state hospitals, Karamandanio - a children&#x27;s hospital, and the Center of Chest Diseases of Southwestern Greece. A large range of private hospitals and clinics operate in parallel.

Numerous art venues and an ultra-modern archaeological museum were constructed for the needs of European Culture Capital designation. The cultural and educational facilities include the Municipal Library, the university libraries, many theatres, the municipal art gallery, the University of Patras&#x27;s facilities, the Hellenic Open University and the Technical Institute of Patras. A number of research facilities are also established in the university campus area.

===European Capital of Culture 2006===
Patras was chosen by the European Commission to be the European Capital of Culture for the year 2006. The concept of the event revolved around the main theme of &quot;Bridges&quot; and &quot;Dialogues&quot;, drawing benefit from the city&#x27;s rich history and its position as a &quot;Gate to the West&quot;, to underline the essence of the productive interaction of culture and civilisations in Europe. The EU Commission found Patras&#x27; plans very ambitious and also commented that a successful hosting of the title by a medium-sized city would make it possible to redefine the meaning of the term Cultural Capital.

The Selection Panel for 2006 noted in its final report:

In 2006 various cultural events were held in the context of the European Capital of Culture. Among the artists presenting their work in Patras were: Gary Burton, Maxim Shostakovich, Ian Anderson - with the Patras Municipal Orchestra, Jean Louis Trintignant, Roberto Benigni, Eros Ramazzotti and José Carreras. With the completion of the Capital of Culture programme, a part of the old Ladopoulos factory was renovated to host exhibitions, a small theatre (named the Art Factory), was built and a number of neoclassical buildings around the city were renovated as part of a plan to preserve the city&#x27;s architectural heritage and link it to its cultural life. The new Archaeological museum was completed in 2009. Its globe-like roof and modern architectural design enhances the town&#x27;s northern entrance, taking its place among the other city landmarks.

There is also a sizeable community of Roman Catholics and an Anglican church, part of the Church of England&#x27;s Diocese in Europe.

The most significant church in the city is the Orthodox Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, in the south west of the city center. The construction of the church began in 1908 under the supervision of the architect Anastasios Metaxas, followed by Georgios Nomikos. It was inaugurated in 1974. It is the largest church in Greece and the third-largest Byzantine-style church in the Balkans, after the Cathedral of Saint Sava in Belgrade and Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia.

==Transport==



===Seaport===
The city has always been a sea-trade hub because of its strategic position. The port manages more than half of the foreign sea-passenger transportation in Greece, and has excellent car-ferry links with the Ionian islands and the major Adriatic ports of Italy. Additionally, a new port was built in the southern section of the city to accommodate the increased traffic and relieve the city centre from port operations. In 2011, this port went into operation. Ferries to Italy now dock there.

The port is connected by a number of daily routes to the Ionian islands Kerkyra, Kefallonia, to the port of Igoumenitsa and to the Italian cities Ancona, Bari, Brindisi, Trieste and Venice.

===Roads===
A newly constructed, ring road (the Bypass of Patras) was first opened in 2002 in order to alleviate heavy traffic throughout the city. A mini ring road (known as the &quot;Mini bypass&quot; of Patras) is now complete (2019), alleviating heavy traffic-related problems in the city centre. The mini-bypass is a two lanes mototway bridging the northern city entrance at the Zavlani neighborhood to the eastern entrance at the Aroi, Synora and Upper town (Ano poli) neighborhoods reducing the city centre crossing time to less than 4 minutes drive.

Two large highways were also constructed, connecting the seacoast and the new port with the Bypass of Patras. The first is over the small Diakoniaris river (from Eleftheriou Venizelou street until the Bypass&#x27;es exit in Eglykada), while the second consists of two roads, each, that run in parallel with the Glafkos river entering at the city&#x27; s New Port. Another project was completed recently, leading to an additional entrance to the downtown area after expanding and widening Kanakari street. This work led to a fast, direct connection of the city&#x27;s mini bypass road with the city centre.

The highway connection with Athens was recently upgraded to a 220 km closed highway (Olympia odos), with a speed limit of 130 km/hour, reducing the transit time to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The highway was connected to the Large bypass highway and is expected to extend all the way to Pyrgos by the end of 2023. Patras will also be the central hub of the Ionia Odos highway, intended to bridge western Greece from Kalamata to Ioannina and the Kakavia border station. The Rio-Antirio bridge is north of the city and links the Peloponnese to mainland Greece. It was completed in August 2004.

Additional work was recently announced to begin in 2023 in order to connect via highway the Rion Antirrion bridge with Nafpaktos, Itea, Amfissa and Lamia. This project is expected to reduce the trip to Lamia to 90 minutes and its completion is expexted in 2025.

Patras is bypassed by the Olympia Odos (A8) motorway, which is also part of the E55 route that crosses the Rio-Antirio Bridge, dominating the sealine across the Gulf of Corinth. 
*GR-5/E55
*GR-8/E55 and E65 (partly Panepistimiou Street)
*GR-8A
*GR-9/E55 (partly Akti Dymaion)
*GR-33 (partly Kalavryton, Georgiou Papandreou Street and Akrotiriou)
*Bypass of Patras

===Rail===
A rudimentary single, narrow-gauge railway track crosses the city and connects it to Rio. In the past regional rail links were provided by the Hellenic Railways Organisation, connecting Patras to Athens and Piraeus as well as to Pyrgos and Kalamata. OSE announced the suspension of all the rail service in the Peloponnese in January 2011 so today the railway track is in use only by suburban trains that connect Patras with the adjacent villages of Rio and Agios Vasileios.

The central passenger train station of Patras which is a small building constructed in 1954, lies to the west of the downtown area, between Othonos-Amalias Avenue and the north port. The main freight station of Aghios Andreas lies further to the south, next to the homonymous church and it is not in use any more. Finally, the old depot of Aghios Dionysios, consisting of about ten tracks, offers basic turntable and roundhouse facilities; it is about long.

A new double standard gauge railway line, the Athens Airport–Patras railway, is under construction and will link Patras to Korinth and further to Athens. The construction works are currently in progress close to the suburbs of Patras, but the remaining few kilometres till the city centre and the new port are still under study because of various financial and technical problems. As of 2020, the new railway reaches Aigio, east of Patras.

===Public transport===

Patras is served by buses. There are two transport lines to and from the University of Patras and some nearby lines to city suburbs such as Saravali, Glafkos, and Paralia. All the urban bus lines are about 40, with three numbers.

Commuter rail services have recently been established by Proastiakos, with one line currently connecting Patras, Rio, and Agios Vasileios.

Regional bus links are provided by the KTEL bus company and connect the city to most of Greece.

===Air===
Seasonal civilian air transport is provided by the military Patras Araxos Airport, about from the city&#x27;s centre.

==International relations==
Patras is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities programme.

===Twin towns — sister cities===

Patras is twinned with:
Patras was selected as main motif for the €10 Greek Patras 2006 commemorative coin, minted in 2006. This coin was designed to commemorate an event signaling an enlightened course for Patras and serving as a reminder of the way in which culture can stimulate the economy and promote development, when Patras was appointed European Capital of Culture. On the obverse is the logo for Patras 2006 around the words &quot;European Capital of Culture&quot;.

<doc id="470692" wikidata="Q271247" url="?curid=470692" title="Naomi Kawase">
<text>is a Japanese film director. She was also known as , with her former husband&#x27;s surname. Many of her works have been documentaries, including &quot;Embracing&quot;, about her search for the father who abandoned her as a child, and &quot;Katatsumori&quot;, about the grandmother who raised her.

==Early life and education==
Growing up in the rural region of Nara, Japan, Kawase&#x27;s parents split early on in her childhood, leaving her to be raised by her great-aunt, with whom she held a combative, yet loving, relationship.

She originally attended the Osaka School of Photography (Ōsaka Shashin Senmon Gakkō; now Visual Arts College Osaka) to study television production, but she became interested in film and decided to switch her focus. She was a student of Shunji Dodo at the college. She graduated in 1989.

==Career==
After graduating, she spent an additional four years at the college as a lecturer before releasing &quot;Embracing&quot;. Employing her interest in autobiography, most of her first short films focus on her turbulent family history, including her abandonment and her father&#x27;s death. Many of her first forays into filmmaking were autobiographical, inspired heavily by the rural landscape.

Between 1994 and 1996, she released a trilogy of films about her great-aunt: &quot;Katatsumori&quot;, &quot;See Heaven&quot; and &quot;Sun on the Horizon&quot;. She novelized her films &quot;Suzaku&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;.

In 2006, she released the forty-minute documentary &quot;Tarachime&quot;, which she prefers to be screened before her film from the following year. &quot;Tarachime&quot; revisits Kawase&#x27;s relationship with her great-aunt, tackling very personal themes such as her aunt&#x27;s growing dementia.

Kawase completed production on her fourth full-length film &quot;The Mourning Forest&quot; (&quot;Mogari no Mori&quot;), which premièred in June 2007 in her hometown Nara and went on to win the Grand Prix at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

Her 2011 film &quot;Hanezu&quot; premiered in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

Pop star Hikaru Utada asked Kawase to create the music video for her 2012 single &quot;Sakura Nagashi&quot; (桜流し, lit. &quot;Flowing Cherry Blossoms/Cherry Blossoms Sinking&quot;), later to be included on Utada&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Fantôme&quot;.

In 2013 Kawase was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

Her 2014 film &quot;Still the Water&quot; was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Her 2015 film &quot;Sweet Bean&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

In April 2016 she was announced as the president of the jury for the Cinéfondation and short films section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Kawase had been selected by the IOC to shoot the official film for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Released in 2022, the two-part film places the 2020 Olympics within the wider context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the mixed reactions to the games from Japanese society.

==Controversies==
On December 26, 2021, the NHK aired a documentary about the production behind Kawase&#x27;s 2020 Olympics documentary. Footage and captions alleged that protesters were paid money to attend anti-Olympics demonstrations as part of larger opposition against the games. One of the men interviewed later stated he was &quot;unsure&quot; if he had actually attended any anti-Olympics rallies. NHK Osaka cited &quot;editorial oversights&quot; and &quot;deficiencies in research&quot;, issuing an apology. They denied that the footage was deliberately fabricated to be misleading. On January 13, 2022, the NHK Osaka director Terunobu Maeda apologized during a press conference, admitting that the captions &quot;should not have been included&quot;. Again he denied that the incident was a fabrication. On February 10, 2022 NHK Osaka announced an internal review and fired 6 production staff members. 

In April 2022, &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; reported that Kawase kicked a camera assistant in the stomach while filming &quot;True Mothers&quot; in May 2019, leading cinematographer Yūta Tsukinaga and his team to resign mid-production. Kawase did not deny the allegation. In May 2022, the magazine also reported that she assaulted an employee at her production company, Kumie, in October 2015. The employee was reportedly punched in the face with a closed fist and chased through the office by Kawase. Later that day the employee gathered his belongings from the office and quit. When interviewed by Shūkan Bunshun he stated, &quot;It&#x27;s true that I was punched by Kawase-san. It&#x27;s something that occurred in the past and is not something I will comment about publicly.&quot;

Kawase denied both allegations and claimed the matters were handled internally.

==Styles and themes==
Kawase&#x27;s work is heavily concerned with the distorted space between fiction and non-fiction that has occurred within the state of modern Japanese society, approaching &quot;fiction with a documentarian&#x27;s gaze.&quot; She employs this documentary-realism to focus on individuals of lesser cultural status, challenging prevailing representations of women within the male-dominated Japanese film industry. This theme is also connected to her own personal reflections on contemporary issues in the current climate of economic depression such as the declining birthrate, alienation, and the collapse of traditional family structures.

She frequently shoots on location with amateur actors.

Kawase&#x27;s style also invokes the autobiographical practices related to documentary style. Familiar and personal objects such as childhood photographs, and to explore her family history and identity. Her work reflects the personal, intimate, and domestic. Themes that are often associated with feminist practices and Women&#x27;s Cinema.

However, Kawase herself does not classify as a feminist due to Japanese feminism&#x27;s tendency to persist collective identity and view women&#x27;s problems through a narrow ideological lens. Instead, she looks at gender as a creative and fluid realm, rather than as a negative fixation. Kawase explains:
Kawase&#x27;s films challenge cinematic conventions. Her subjects are primarily family and friends, and she frequently depicts the relationships between the filmmaker and the subject, and is self-reflexive of her own thoughts and emotions in her works.

==Awards==
She became the youngest winner of the la Caméra d&#x27;Or award (best new director) at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for her first 35mm film, &quot;Suzaku&quot;.

This is a list of some of her awards:
*1997: Camera D&#x27;Or, Cannes International Film Festival: &quot;Suzaku&quot;

<doc id="470717" wikidata="Q6679248" url="?curid=470717" title="Lord Forrester">
<text>The title Lord Forrester was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1633 for Sir George Forrester, Bt who had already been created a baronet in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1625. When his only son died, Forrester was given a regrant of the peerage in 1651 with special remainders:

*a) firstly to George&#x27;s third daughter&#x27;s husband, James Baillie and their issue in tail male.
*b) secondly to James&#x27; younger brother, William, and also the husband of George&#x27;s fourth daughter, Lilias and their issue in tail male.
*c) thirdly to the issue of the brothers by their wives in tail general (including females) according to primogeniture.
*d) and fourthly to James&#x27; heirs male or of entail to be made by him.

Upon George&#x27;s death three years later, his son-in-law, James (who had changed his surname to Forrester) inherited the title. James&#x27; only child by George&#x27;s daughter had died in 1652 and though he had further issue by his second wife, Lady Jean Ruthven (daughter of the 1st Earl of Brentford), upon his own murder by Mrs Hamilton in 1679, the title passed to his younger brother, William as stipulated by the second remainder (b). William&#x27;s son (who also changed his surname to Forrester) inherited the title in 1681 and it continued in the male line until the death of the seventh Lord in 1763, when it passed to the sixth Lord&#x27;s sister, Caroline. Her only daughter, Anna inherited the title in 1784 and it then passed to Anna&#x27;s first cousin-once-removed, Viscount Grimston (later Earl of Verulam) in 1808, with which family the title continues to be held by to this day.

The earliest known individual of that name in the neighbourhood of West Edinburgh was a William Forrester, Esquire, who appears on the muster roll of the Peel of Linlithgow in 1311.

Alexander Forrester, John Forrester&#x27;s great-grandson, was confirmed by James V in the lands and Barony of Corstorphine including Clerkington, Nether Liberton, Drilaw and Meadowfield. In 1539 he resigned Corstorphine in favour of James Forrester of Meadowfield, the husband of Alexander&#x27;s granddaughter Agnes. This James ultimately succeeded Alexander and became James Forrester of Corstorphine.

At Holyrood House on 30 July 1618 James VI &amp; I confirmed Sir George Forrester of Corstorphine in the lands and barony of Corstorphine. George had already had some land disjoined from the barony of Corstorphine which he had sold. On 22 July 1633 he was created Lord Forrester of Corstorphine by Charles I. Having no son to succeed him Lord Forrester resigned most of his properties, including Corstorphine, in favour of James Baillie. Baillie was the eldest son of Major General William Baillie of Lethame, who had married his fourth daughter Johanna around 1649.

During the mid-seventeenth century the family seems to have experienced some financial problems which resulted in lands being temporarily out of their control. On 3 August 1663 the lands and Barony of Corstorphine, except for the castle of Corstorphine and the town of Corstorphine, was granted to Sir John Gilmour. Oliver Cromwell had granted Laurence Scott of Bavelaw and his wife Katherine Binning, the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine, tower, manor-place, mills, mill-lands, parsonage etc., in lieu of the money due by James, Lord Forrester, to Beatrix Ramsay in Corstorphine who had assigned the debt to the said Laurence Scott, 1654. On 5 August 1664 the lands, Lordship and Barony of Corstorphine formerly belonging to James, Lord Forrester, and his brother German William Baillie which had been taken in lieu of debt, were granted to Florentius Gardner, baillie of Grangepans. (Similarly lands in Stirlingshire owned by Lord Forrester were taken to pay his debts to Richard Murray and Margaret Gairdner, in 1655.)

James Forrester of Corstorphine (son of the previously mentioned James Forrester), husband of Janet Lauder, was confirmed by Mary, Queen of Scots, on 5 February 1556 in the Barony of Corstorphine. In 1577 Sir James presented the parish kirk with a bell for its steeple. This bell still survives, although it was renewed in 1728. James died on 4 June 1589 and his brother Henry was declared to be his heir.

On the death of Sir William in 1796 the said baronies passed to his brother Sir John Dick, and in 1812 on his death they passed to his brother Sir Robert Keith Dick. In 1869 the barony of Corstorphine was sold to a John Dickson, then residing at Saughton Mains, which was confirmed on 4 May 1871. The barony remained with the Dickson family, who were for the most part Edinburgh lawyers, until 1986 when the last remaining interests in the barony, for by this time almost all of the land had been sold, was given to The Corstorphine Trust.
Title passed from The Corstorphine Trust to the present and 34th Baron of Corstorphine, Michael John Milne in November 2005. The title was recorded in the Scottish Barony Register on 21 December 2005.

James Baillie&#x27;s first wife Johanna died early. He then married Janet Ruthven, daughter of the Earl of Forth. This latest Lord Forrester was a man of dubious morals and seduced his niece, the wife of an Edinburgh burgess James Nimmo. She, however, later quarrelled with Forrester and stabbed him to death in his garden at Corstorphine on 26 August 1679. Mrs. Nimmo was later executed at the Cross of Edinburgh for the murder. The titles then fell to William, the son of his brother William Baillie and his wife Lillias, daughter of the first Lord Forrester.

William, as 4th Lord Forrester, married Margaret, daughter of Sir Andrew Birnie, a Judge of the Court of Session. They had several children including George who succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1705. During this period, in 1698, the estate of Corstorphine was sold to Hugh Wallace of Ingliston, a Writer to the Signet. He later, in 1713, sold it to Sir James Dick of Prestonfield, in whose family it remained until 1869. (The Dicks were a prominent family of lawyers and merchants in Edinburgh. Sir James Dick (1643–1728) was a merchant and baillie of Edinburgh and also served as Dean of Guild and later Lord Provost.)

<doc id="470718" wikidata="Q399899" url="?curid=470718" title="Ahal Region">
<text>Ahal Region (; from , also ) is one of five provinces of Turkmenistan. It is in the south-center of the country, bordering Iran and Afghanistan along the Kopet Dag Range. Its area is and population 886,845 (2022 census).

==Overview==
In 2000, Ahal Region accounted for 14% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s population, 11% of the total number of employed, 23% of agricultural production (by value), and 31% of the country&#x27;s total industrial production.

Ahal&#x27;s agriculture is irrigated by the Karakum Canal, which stretches all the way across the province from east to west, tracking Turkmenistan&#x27;s southern border. Another water source is the Tejen River, which flows north from Afghanistan in the southeast corner of the province, passing through two large reservoirs south of the city of Tejen.

Ahal is known for the Battle of Geok Tepe of 1881, today the site of the imposing Saparmurat Hajji Mosque, and for the Bäherden underground warm lake (in the Kov Ata karst cave), both west of Ashgabat.

The administrative centre of Ahal Province is Arkadag, a $1.5 billion mostly greenfield development just west of the city limit of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan&#x27;s capital city. The city was named in honor of former President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, whose official nickname is Arkadag. The capital until 20 December 2022 was Änew (or Anau), a city on the south-eastern outskirts of Ashgabat. One other notable city is Tejen in the south-east near the border with Mary Province. Turkmenistan&#x27;s largest city, Ashgabat, is surrounded by Ahal Province, but as the national capital it enjoys status equal to that of a province and is outside Ahal Province&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==History==
From antiquity through the early 1800s, the area was populated by Persian-speaking peoples. Nisa, since 2013 located within the city limits of Ashgabat, was likely founded in the third century BCE and was the first capital of the Parthian Empire. The area just north of the Kopet Dag mountains forms an oasis due to runoff from the mountains and was thus part of the Silk Road caravan route from roughly 2000 BCE until around 1500 CE.

===Turkmen period=== 
British Lieutenant Colonel H.C. Stuart reported in 1881 that the Ahal branch of the Teke tribe of the Turkmen ethnic group arrived in the area around 1830 and established several semi-nomadic villages (&quot;auls&quot;) between what is now the city of Gyzylarbat and village of Gäwers, inclusive. The Ahal area was formally part of Persia but &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous under Turkoman tribal control until Russian forces defeated the Teke army at the Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881.

===Soviet period===
Originally named &quot;Ashgabat oblasty&quot; in Turkmen (, Cyrillic Turkmen ), the future Ahal Province was initially formed on 21 November 1939, abolished on 25 May 1959, and reconstituted on 27 December 1973. In 1977 &quot;Ashgabat oblasty&quot; was awarded the Order of Lenin.

===Independent Turkmenistan===
On 14 December 1992, the People&#x27;s Council () adopted Law No. 783-ХП, &quot;On the Order of Deciding Issues of Administrative-Territorial Structure of Turkmenistan&quot;, and Resolution XM-6. These statutes changed the Russian word oblast&#x27; (область), rendered in Turkmen Cyrillic as област, to the Persian loan word &quot;welaýat&quot; in reference to provinces. The resolution renamed Ashgabat oblasty (, Turkmen Сyrillic: Ашгабат областы) to Ahal welaýaty. Anau was designated the capital of Ahal. The capital was moved to the new city of Arkadag on 20 December 2022.

==Etymology==
Ataniyazov wrote,The meaning of the name is not clear. Khiva historians Munis and Agahi write that the name means &quot;drainage ditch&quot; and it was so named because the Ahal lands were swampy and suitable for rice cultivation (MITT, II, p. 359)...Vambery, on the other hand, writes that the word is derived from the word &quot;ak&quot; [white] and the addition of -al (Vambery, p. 264).

==Administrative subdivisions==
===Districts===
Effective January 5, 2018, Ahal Province (&quot;Ahal welaýaty&quot;) is subdivided into 7 districts (&quot;etrap&quot;, plural &quot;etraplar&quot;):
#Ak bugdaý (formerly Gäwers)
#Babadaýhan (formerly Kirov)
#Bäherden (formerly Baharly)
#Gökdepe
#Kaka
#Sarahs
#Tejen

===Municipalities===
As of 9 November 2022, the province included 9 cities (города or &quot;şäherler&quot;), 9 towns (посёлки or &quot;şäherçeler&quot;), 82 rural or village councils (сельские советы or &quot;geňeşlikler&quot;), and 231 villages (села, сельские населенные пункты or &quot;obalar&quot;).

:* Altyn Asyr
:* Änew
:* Arkadag (provincial capital)
:* Babadaýhan
:* Bäherden
:* Gökdepe
:* Kaka
:* Murche, abandoned village
:* Sarahs
:* Tejen

As of May 2013 Ruhabat District and the city of Abadan (today called Büzmeýin), until then in Ahal Province, were incorporated into the city of Ashgabat and abolished as separate municipalities. In January 2018, the Babadaýhan District of Ahal Province was re-established, and the Kaka, Tejen, Sarahs Districts were reaffirmed. Baharly&#x27;s former name, Bäherden, was restored in the same decree, and the Altyn Asyr District was abolished.

On 9 November 2022 the new city of Arkadag was formally incorporated as the new capital city of Ahal and was accorded district status.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
Ahal produces wheat and cotton. Cotton grown in Ahal is ginned at mills in Akdepe, Gökdepe, Kaka, and Tejen, and spun into cotton yarn at mills in Ashgabat, Gökdepe, and Kaka. Textile complexes are found in Ashgabat, Akdepe (Bäherden), Gökdepe, and Kaka.

Cotton seed is crushed for extraction of oil and meal at the Ahal Vegetable Oil Enterprise plant near Ovadandepe. It was opened on 17 May 2010 with a design capacity to process 96,000 tons of cotton seed per year, with daily production of 50 tons of cottonseed oil, 10 tons of margarine, 140 tons of cottonseed meal and 70 tons of soybean hulls.

===Industry===
On June 28, 2019, a $1.7 billion factory for producing gasoline out of natural gas was commissioned in Ovadandepe, Gökdepe District. Built by Rönesans and Kawasaki using technology from Haldor Topsoe, the factory has a design capacity of 600,000 tonnes of gasoline, 12,000 tonnes of Diesel fuel, and 115,000 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas per year, produced from 1.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

In 2019, Turkmenistan produced 5.1 million standard square meters (4mm thickness) of sheet glass, all of it in Ahal. A$375 million float glass and glass container plant built by Tepe Inşaat of Turkey was opened February 14, 2018, in Ovadandepe north of Ashgabat. It replaced a Soviet-era glass factory located in central Ashgabat. In 2019, the value of Turkmenistan&#x27;s glass exports as reported by trading partners was $9.5 million.

A steel smelter, Türkmen Demir Önümleri Döwlet Kärhanasy (), operating on scrap metal is located at kilometer 22 on the Ashgabat-Dashoguz Automobile Highway near Ovadandepe. It produces mainly rebar and channel iron.

The $240 million Tejen urea (carbamide) plant, inaugurated on March 18, 2005, has a design capacity of 350,000 tonnes of urea per year.

The Baherden Cement Plant, put into operation in 2005, has a design capacity of one million tons of cement per year. In 2019 the Baherden plant reportedly was operating at 64% of capacity. The Kelete Cement Plant has a design capacity of one million tons per year, but as of 2019 was producing at 8.1% of that level.

The Derweze State Electrical Power Station (), a 504.4 megawatt power plant built by Çalık Enerji in 2015, is located near Ovadandepe. The Ahal State Power Station (), located about 9 kilometers NE of Anau, with design capacity of 650 megawatts, was constructed in 2010 to power the city of Ashgabat and expanded in 2013 and 2014 to power the Olympic Village.

===Government installations===
The Ovadandepe Prison is located approximately 30 kilometers NNW of G. Orazow adyndaky oba, the seat of the Ovadandepe Rural Council (). The National Space Agency&#x27;s ground station for communicating with the TurkmenÄlem-52E satellite is located approximately 6 kilometers north of the Ashgabat city limit off the P-1 highway.

<doc id="470722" wikidata="Q486073" url="?curid=470722" title="Balkan Region">
<text>Balkan Region () is the westernmost of the five regions of Turkmenistan. Clockwise from north it borders Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan (north); two provinces of Turkmenistan (east), Iran (south), and the Caspian Sea (west). The capital city is Balkanabat, formerly known as Nebit Dag. The region&#x27;s boundaries are identical to those of the former &quot;Krasnovodsk Oblast&#x27;&quot;, a Soviet-era province of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic with its capital in the city of Krasnovodsk. This oblast was liquidated and restored repeatedly in the 20th century, concluding with its abolition in 1988. However, the administrative boundaries of the region were restored in 1991 when Balkan Region was established with its capital being moved to Nebit Dag which was later renamed Balkanabat. 

The province covers 139,270 square kilometers and counts 529,895 residents (2022 estimate). A large minority of these are nomadic herding families. Its population density of 3.8 persons per square kilometer is the lowest in Turkmenistan.

Other cities include: Bereket, Türkmenbaşy, Gumdag, Serdar, Hazar, Etrek, and Esenguly.

Balkan Region has significant hydrocarbon reserves, which in 2019 accounted for 13.9% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s natural gas production and 93.1% of its petroleum production. It also generated 15.4% of the country&#x27;s electric power. Due to the very low water supply, agriculture is negligible, and only 4.5% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s arable lands are within the province.

Off its Caspian shores, the Balkan Region includes the island of Ogurja Ada, the largest in the Caspian Sea.

==Etymology==

One conjecture holds that Balkan comes from &quot;Bal akan&quot; meaning “where the honey flows”, possibly relating to the locally rich petroleum sources. However, Atanyyazow explains,This name is derived from the Balkan word meaning &quot;mountain&quot; in ancient Turkic languages (Khasanov, p. 47) - compare the Balkan mountains in Bulgaria. In the Turkic language, it is also used to mean &quot;mountain&quot;, &quot;mountain-top mountains&quot; (1 Uretsko-Russian. Sl. M, 1931, p. 110). In the dictionaries of Budagovyts and Gadlovyts, it also occurs in the same sense. This ancient name, which existed in the early 11th century, is interpreted by local elders as &quot;honey flowing&quot;...

==Administrative subdivisions==
===Districts===
Balkan Province (&quot;Balkan welaýaty&quot;) is subdivided into 6 districts (&quot;etrap&quot;, plural &quot;etraplar&quot;):

# Bereket (previously Gazanjyk)
# Esenguly (previously Hasan-Kuli)
# Etrek (previously Gyzyletrek)
# Gyzylarbat (from 1999 to 2022 called Serdar)
# Magtymguly (previously Garry Gala)
# Türkmenbaşy

In addition, part of the city of Turkmenbashy is subdivided into a borough with district status and thus a presidentially appointed mayor.

* City Boroughs of Türkmenbaşy City:
# Awaza etraby

The former Kenar Borough (&quot;Kenar etraby&quot;) of the city of Turkmenbashy was abolished effective 9 November 2022.

===Municipalities===
As of January 1, 2017, the province included 10 cities (города or &quot;şäherler&quot;), 13 towns (посёлки or &quot;şäherçeler&quot;), 33 rural or village councils (сельские советы or &quot;geňeşlikler&quot;), and 112 villages (села, сельские населенные пункты or &quot;obalar&quot;). Two cities, Gumdag and Hazar, were downgraded to town status in November 2022, reducing the number of cities to eight and increasing the number of towns by two. The town of Garagöl was annexed by the town of Hazar, bringing the number of towns to 14.

In the list below, cities with &quot;district status&quot; are bolded:
:*Balkanabat (formerly Nebit-Dag)
:*Bereket (formerly Gazanjyk ( ))
:*Esenguly (formerly Hasan Kuli) ( )
:*Etrek (formerly Gyzyletrek)
:*Garabogaz (formerly Bekdaş)
:*Gyzylarbat (from 1999 to 2022 called Serdar) 
:*Magtymguly (formerly Garrygala) ( )
:*Türkmenbaşy City (formerly Krasnovodsk)

==Industry==
From 2017 to 2019, Balkan Province produced these volumes of industrial products:
Turkmenistan&#x27;s largest petroleum refinery is in the city of Turkmenbashy &quot;(viz.)&quot;.

The Balkan Cement Plant in Jebel was built in 2011 by Turkish firm Polimeks and has a design capacity of one million tons per year.

The Kiyanly Polymer Factory (), inaugurated October 17, 2018, features design capacity to produce 381 thousand tonnes of polyethylene and 81 thousand tonnes of polypropylene per year. Built at a cost of $3.4 billion by LG International, Hyundai Engineering, Toyo Engineering, and Gap Inşaat (a subsidiary of Çalık Holding), the plant cracks methane and ethane for production of polymers. In the first ten months of 2019, however, the factory produced only 67,900 tonnes of polyethylene and 12,700 tonnes of polypropylene.

The $1.3 billion Garabogaz urea (carbamide) plant, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and GAP İnşaat, was inaugurated on September 18, 2018, with a design capacity of 1.16 million tonnes of urea per year. Between January and October 2019, the Garabogaz plant produced approximately 392,000 tonnes of urea, of which 261,000 tonnes was exported. 

Three factories produce iodine in Turkmenistan, all in Balkan Province: one each in Balkanabat, Hazar, and Bereket. The Bereket plant is designed to produce 150 tonnes per year of iodine. Following planned renovations and upgrades, the Balkanabat and Hazar plants will have design capacities of 250 tonnes and 300 tonnes of iodine, respectively, plus 2400 tonnes and 4500 tonnes of bromine, respectively, per year. Total production of iodine in 2019 was 681.4 tonnes.

==Transportation==
The M37 highway begins at the Turkmenbashi International Seaport and leads eastward 1200 kilometers in the direction of Ashgabat, Mary, Türkmenabat, and the border with Uzbekistan. A network of paved roads connects major population centers, including the P-15, P-16, P-17, P-18, and P-20 highways. Passenger and car ferry service is available between the seaport in Turkmenbashy and Baku. A major airport is located in Turkmenbashy, and smaller airports are located in Balkanabat, Etrek, Garabogaz, Hazar, and Jebel. A military airfield is located at Ýangyja.

The Trans-Caspian Railway begins in Turkmenbashy and extends eastward to Uzbekistan via Ashgabat, Mary, and Turkmenabat. The International North–South Transport Corridor passes through Balkan Province and intersects the Trans-Caspian Railway at Bereket, which features a large locomotive depot and repair works.

In addition to the seaport at Turkmenbashy, smaller vessel-loading facilities are found at Garabogaz (urea) and Gyýanly (polymers). Turkmenbashi International Seaport operates oil-loading terminals at Alaja, Ekerem, and Kenar, and Dragon Oil loads oil at the port of Hazar.

<text>Anitra Linnéa Steen (; on 13 May 1949) is a Swedish politician, civil servant and the wife of former Prime Minister Göran Persson.

Steen held various governmental roles since 1989: state secretary for Persson-led Ministry of Education and then for the Ministry of Finance, as well as director-general of the Council for Higher Education and the Tax Agency. Between 1999 and May 2009, when she retired, she was the manager of Systembolaget, the Swedish state alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly. In that role she was forced to cope with a full blown corruption scandal, involving bribery of shop managers and senior staff by some major suppliers, including Vin &amp; Sprit, formerly the producing and importing division of the Swedish state monopoly. Vin &amp; Sprit is now owned by Pernod Ricard.

==Personal life==
Steen was born in Västanfors, Fagersta, Västmanland. She graduated from Uppsala University in 1971.

In 1970, she married Per Olof Steen, with whom she has two children; the couple later divorced. Since 6 December 2003, she has been married to Göran Persson, former Prime Minister of Sweden. Because of her personal connection to the head of the Swedish government, her independence as a board member of Scandinavian Airlines, which is jointly owned by the Scandinavian governments, was put in question by some.

<text>A Steinke hood, named for its inventor, Lieutenant Harris Steinke, is a device designed to aid escape from a sunken submarine. In essence, it is an inflatable life jacket with a hood that completely encloses the wearer&#x27;s head, trapping a bubble of breathable air. It is designed to assist buoyant ascent. An advancement over its predecessor, the Momsen lung, Steinke invented and tested it in 1961 by escaping from the at a depth of ; it became standard equipment in all submarines of the United States Navy throughout the Cold War period. The U.S. Navy replaced Steinke hoods on U.S. submarines with escape suits called Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment in the late 2000s.

<doc id="470728" wikidata="Q7622388" url="?curid=470728" title="Straw purchase">
<text>A straw purchase or nominee purchase is any purchase wherein an agent agrees to acquire a good or service for someone who is often unable or unwilling to purchase the good or service themselves, and the agent transfers the goods or services to that person after purchasing them. In general, straw purchases are legal except in cases where the ultimate receiver of goods or services uses those goods or services in the commission of a crime with the prior knowledge of the straw purchaser, or if the ultimate possessor is not legally able to purchase the goods or services.

In some jurisdictions, straw purchases are legal even if the end user is not legally able to purchase the good or service themselves.

==Legal uses==
Examples of legal straw purchases would be purchasing groceries for senior citizens who are unable to go to supermarkets themselves because of poor health or financing an automobile for someone who cannot obtain a loan because of poor credit. In some cases, the agent in the straw purchase may receive money or recompense from the ultimate possessor. Obtaining loans through a straw buyer is legal except when the agent and ultimate user of the funds defraud the lender or foreseeable ultimate lender, such as by signing false mortgage documents designed to be mingled with other mortgages and securitized, or when the loan terms expressly prohibit use of an agent to obtain funds.

If straw purchases are legal despite the good or service purchased not being legal for the end user to receive, the end user may become liable for illegally possessing or receiving the good or service, but the straw buyer who was legally able to make the purchase is generally not held liable for their actions.

==Illegal uses==

===Firearms===

In the United States, a straw purchaser of a firearm at a federally licensed firearm dealership who lies about the identity of the ultimate possessor of the gun can be charged with making false statements on a federal Firearms Transaction Record, which is a felony. Note that in this case, purchasing the item for another person is ipso facto illegal, regardless of that person&#x27;s status as a legal possessor. If a firearm is purchased as a gift, the transaction is not a straw purchase, and the person buying the gift is considered the end user. It is illegal for any person not in possession of a Federal Firearms License to purchase a firearm with the intention of resale. Private purchases in lawful sales made outside of federally regulated dealerships are not subject to such rules and are federally legal unless the gun is used in a crime with the prior knowledge of the straw purchaser.

===Alcohol===
Straw purchases of alcohol are illegal in most jurisdictions when a person under the legal drinking age requests that a person above the legal age purchase alcohol for the underage person, and the straw purchaser knows or might reasonably assume based on the circumstances that the person is under the legal age.

In England and Wales, buying alcohol on behalf of a person under 18 is a summary offence under section 149 of the Licensing Act 2003, punishable by an unlimited fine (level 5 on the standard scale). There is an exception for beer, wine or cider served to a 16 or 17 year old with a meal at a table.

=== Tobacco and nicotine products ===
As of October 2015, it is an offence to buy tobacco, cigarette papers (for the purpose of smoking tobacco) or e-cigarettes on behalf of individuals under 18 years of age in England and Wales. It was already an offence in Scotland.

===Mortgage loans===
The use of a straw person to obtain auto or mortgage loan funds is illegal if and when the funds are misused intentionally. In Canada, the Bank of Montreal sued hundreds of people, including Federal Conservative MP Devinder Shory, for allegedly being involved in a mortgage fraud in which the bank lost $30 million. The bank alleged that straw buyers, in exchange for a cash payment, applied for mortgage loans in the Calgary area on behalf of other parties and knew before submitting the applications that the loans would not be paid. The lawsuits were settled out of court.

In &quot;United States v. Quintero-Lopez&quot;, two men were charged with locating eight straw purchasers for homes and helping the straw purchasers falsify pay history documents in order to obtain $8.3 million in mortgage loans. The government alleged these loan purchases were illegal because the straw purchasers inflated their incomes as part of an attempt to defraud the lenders. In 2011, one of the two straw purchaser recruiters was sentenced to six years in prison and the other was sentenced to one year of probation. Straw or nominee purchases of mortgage loans are legal when intent to defraud is not present.

<doc id="470730" wikidata="Q487389" url="?curid=470730" title="Lebap Region">
<text>Lebap Region () is one of the regions of Turkmenistan. It is in the northeast of the country, bordering Afghanistan, Uzbekistan along the Amu Darya. Its administrative centre is Türkmenabat (formerly named Çärjew). It has an area of 93,727 square kilometers, and a population of 1,447,298 people (2022 census).

The name Lebap is a Turkmenized form of the Persian &quot;Lab-e āb&quot; (), which means &quot;riverside&quot; and has long been used to designate the middle reaches of the Amu Darya.

It contains the Repetek Nature Reserve as well as the Köýtendag Nature Reserve, which includes Turkmenistan&#x27;s highest mountain, Aýrybaba (3137 meters). Lebap is also home to the Dayahatyn caravansaray.

The region is located along the Amu Darya. The Kyzylkum Desert is located on the east side of the river and Karakum Desert is located on the west side of the river. About three-quarters of the region&#x27;s land area is in the Karakum Desert. The region&#x27;s sunny weather and abundance of water resources help produce high-quality long-staple cotton.

== History ==
The region of present-day Lebap once occupied a spot along the Silk Road. The 9th-10th century caravansaray of Dayahatyn is located within Lebap.

===Bukhara and Khiva khanates===
Prior to the Russian Revolution, much of today&#x27;s Lebap Region was part of either the Khanate of Bukhara or the Khanate of Khiva. The last khan of Bukhara, Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan, nominally submitted to Soviet authority, but in reality joined the Basmachi movement and rebelled against the Bolsheviks. He fled in 1920, and the area was declared a people&#x27;s republic until Soviet power was firmly established in 1924. In that same year, the settlements at Çärjew and Kerki were formally assigned to the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, along with the western parts of the Khiva khanate along the Amu Darya.

===Recent history===
On April 27, 2020, the region was hit by a severe windstorm. RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty alleged that the storm disrupted much of the region&#x27;s electrical grid, public water supplies, natural gas connections, cell service, and internet connection. A local human rights website, Turkmen.news, reported that many people were admitted to the regional hospital in Türkmenabat after suffering injuries. They also alleged that there was sporadic looting in the storm&#x27;s aftermath and that food prices in the region rose as a result of the storm. Local Turkmen media reported 10 deaths resulting from the storm, while Turkmen.news suggested that the true death toll was likely in the dozens, and dozens remained unaccounted for in the storm&#x27;s aftermath. The rights group Human Rights Watch condemned what it perceived as &quot;censorship&quot; by local officials following the storm, noting that one group alleged that local police were watching out for people filming the storm&#x27;s damage, and another group reported that dozens of people were detained for allegedly sending videos &quot;abroad&quot;.

In December 2020, RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty reported that regional officials threatened to cut off the region&#x27;s population from subsidized food if they were not up to date on their utility bills. The agency reported that many in the region received seasonal income from farming, and often did not earn money in the winter, and such matters were complicated by a decrease in remittances to the region as a result of the economic fallout from COVID-19.

==Administrative divisions==
As of 2021, according to the official website of the regional government, Lebap Region included one city with status equivalent to a district, 10 districts, 14 cities &quot;in the district&quot; (), 24 towns, 105 rural councils, and 429 villages.

=== Districts ===
As of 9 November 2022 Lebap Region () is subdivided into eight districts (&quot;etrap&quot;, plural &quot;etraplar&quot;):

:* Çarjew (formerly Serdarabat)
:* Darganata (formerly Birata)
:* Dänew (formerly Galkynyş)
:* Halaç
:* Hojambaz
:* Kerki (formerly Atamyrat)
:* Köýtendag (formerly Çarşaňňy)
:* Saýat

In November 2017 four districts, (Beýik Türkmenbaşy, Garaşsyzlyk, Garabekwül, and Sakar), were abolished and their territories absorbed by other districts. In November 2022 another two districts, Döwletli and Farap, were similarly abolished.

=== Municipalities ===

As of January 1, 2017, the region included 15 cities (, ), 23 towns (, ), 106 rural or village councils (, ), and 430 villages (, , or ).

In the list below, the lone city with &quot;district status&quot; is bolded:
:* Dänew (formerly Galkynyş)
:* Darganata (formerly Birata)
:* Dostluk (formerly Yuzhnyy)
:* Farap

== Economy ==
===Agriculture===
Crop production in Lebap is heavily dependent on irrigation from the Amu Darya. Fields are cultivated when one-and-a-half to two meters above the floodplains of the river, primarily cereal grains and cotton. 

===Extraction industries===
Lebap is rich in various natural resources, most notably, natural gas. The region is home to the Malai Gas Field and the Bagtyýarlyk Gas Field, which both serve as major suppliers of natural gas to China. 

The Garlyk Mining and Enrichment Amalgamate in Köýtendag District produces potash fertilizer, and the Seýdi Oil Refinery is one of two petroleum refineries in Turkmenistan.

From antiquity, local residents quarried sulfur, zinc and lead in the Köýtendag (Kungitang) foothills for domestic needs, including casting of bullets. During the Soviet period, a lead mine was dug and the town of Svintsovyy Rudnik was founded.

===Construction materials===
The Lebap Cement Plant in Turkmenabat has a design capacity of one million tons per year. Polimeks built it in 2012. In 2020, construction of a second plant, in Köýtendag District, also with a design capacity of one million tons, got underway.

===Power generation===
The Zerger power plant under construction by Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Rönesans Holding in Çärjew District will have a design capacity of 432 megawatts. It is primarily intended for export of electricity. The Zerger plant will use natural gas from the Üçajy Gas Field (), delivered via a 125-km high-pressure pipeline.

<text>Mary Region () is one of five provinces in Turkmenistan. It is located in the south-east of the country, bordering Afghanistan. Its capital is the city of Mary. Its area is and population 1,613,386 (2022 census). The average population density is about 15 persons per square kilometer, but it reaches 150–200 per square kilometer in the most developed oases.

In 2000, Mary Region accounted for 23% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s population, 19% of the total number of employed, 26% of agricultural production (by value), and 21% of the country&#x27;s total industrial production. The region&#x27;s industries include natural gas extraction (the Galkynysh Gas Field), electric power generation, textiles, carpet weaving, chemical and food industry. In 2001 it accounted for 74% of Turkmenistan&#x27;s electricity generation 26% of natural gas extraction.

Agriculture in Mary Region is irrigated by the Karakum Canal, which runs east to west through the center of the province, and by the Murghab River, which runs south to north, entering the province from Afghanistan. While the northern portion of the province is within the Central Asian southern desert ecoregion, the southern portion of the province is characterized by a savanna of pistachio and desert sedges, classified as the Badkhiz-Karabil semi-desert by the World Wildlife Fund.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Bronze Age and Iron Age finds support the probability of advanced civilizations in the area including finds associated with a society known to scholars as the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) – near the modern city of Mary, and at the Jeitun and Gonur Tepe archeological sites.

===Founding of Merv===
Alexander the Great conquered the territory in the 4th century BC on his way to South Asia. In 330 BC, Alexander marched northward into Central Asia and founded the city of Alexandria Margiana (Merv) near the Murghab River. A busy Silk Road caravan route, connecting Tang dynasty China and the city of Baghdad (in modern Iraq), passed through Merv. The city of Merv was occupied by the lieutenants of the caliph Uthman ibn Affan, and was constituted as the capital of Khorasan. Using this city as their base, the Arabs, led by their commander Qutayba ibn Muslim, brought under subjection Balkh, Bokhara, Fergana and Kashgaria, and penetrated into China as far as the province of Gansu early in the 8th century.

Merv achieved some political spotlight in February 748 when Abu Muslim (d. 750) declared a new Abbasid dynasty at Merv, and set out from the city to conquer Iran and Iraq and establish a new capital at Baghdad. The goldsmith of Merv famously challenged Abu Muslim to do the right thing and not make war on fellow Muslims. The goldsmith was put to death.

In the latter part of the 8th century, Merv became obnoxious to Islam as the centre of heretical propaganda preached by al-Muqanna &quot;The Veiled Prophet of Khorasan&quot;. Present Turkmenistan was ruled by Tahirids between 821 and 873. In 873, Arab rule in Central Asia came to an end due to the Saffarid conquest. During their dominion, Merv, like Samarkand and Bokhara, was one of the great schools of learning, and the celebrated historian Yaqut studied in its libraries. Merv produced several scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as Islamic law, Hadith, history, literature, and the like.

===Arrival of the Turkmen===

In 1055 Seljuk forces entered Baghdad, becoming masters of the Islamic heartlands and important patrons of Islamic institutions. Until these revolts, Turkmen tribesmen were an integral part of the Seljuk military forces. Turkmen migrated with their families and possessions on Seljuk campaigns into Azerbaijan and Anatolia, which began the Turkification of these areas. During this time, Turkmen also began to settle the area of present-day Turkmenistan. Prior to the Turkmen habitation, most of this desert had been uninhabited, while the more habitable areas along the Caspian Sea, Kopet Dag Mountains, Amu Darya, and Murghab River () were populated predominantly by Iranians. The city-state of Merv was an especially large sedentary and agricultural area, important as both a regional economic-cultural center and a transit hub on the Silk Road. The last powerful Seljuk ruler, Sultan Sanjar (d. 1157), witnessed the fragmentation and destruction of the empire because of attacks by Turkmen and other tribes. During the reign of Sultan Sanjar or Sinjar of the same house, in the middle of the 11th century, Merv was overrun by the Turkish tribes of the Ghuzz from beyond the Oxus. It eventually passed under the sway of the rulers of Khwarezm (Khiva). After mixing with the settled peoples in today&#x27;s Turkmenistan, the Oghuz living north of the Kopet Dag Mountains gradually became known as the Turkmen.

=== Mongols and Timurids ===
In 1157, the Seljuk dynasty came to an end in the province of Khorasan. The Turkic rulers of Khiva took control of the area of Turkmenistan, under the title of Khwarezmshah. In 1221, Central Asia suffered a disastrous invasion by Mongol warriors who swept across the region from their base in eastern Asia. Under their commander, Genghis Khan, founder of the Mongol Empire, the Mongols conquered Khwarezm and burned the city of Merv to the ground. The Mongol leader ordered the massacre of Merv&#x27;s inhabitants as well as the destruction of the province&#x27;s farms and irrigation works, which effectively ended the Iranian dominance in urban areas and agricultural communities of Khwarezm. These areas were soon repopulated by the Turkmen who survived the invasion and had retreated northward to the plains of Kazakhstan or westward to the shores of the Caspian Sea. After the division of the Mongol Empire, present Turkmenistan was passed to the Chagatai Khanate, except the southernmost part belonged to Ilkhanate.

===Khiva and the Persians===
The invasion of the Khan of Khiva, Abul Gazi Bahadur Khan, from 1645 to 1663, caused some difficulties to the Turkmens, coupled with the impact of the drought that occurred at about the same period. Most of the Turkmens within the khanate moved to Ahal, Atrek, Murgap and Tejen. Most of present-day Turkmenistan was divided between the Khanates of Khiva and Bukhara, except southernmost parts under Persian suzerainty. Nader of Persia conquered the entire region in 1740, but after his assassination in 1747 Turkmen lands were recaptured by the Uzbek khanates of Khiva and Bukhara. During the 1830s, the Teke Turkmen, then living on the Tejen River in today&#x27;s Turkmen-Afghan borderlands, were forced by the Persians to migrate northward. Khiva contested the advance of the Tekes, but ultimately, by about 1856, the latter became the sovereign power of southern and southeastern parts of present Turkmenistan.

Lieutenant Colonel C.E. Stuart reported that in the 1830s the Teke tribe began to settle in the lower Murghab River delta near Merv, which, he said, they destroyed around 1855. From here the Teke extended their reach to Kizil-Arvat (today&#x27;s city of Serdar), ultimately splitting into the Ahal Teke, located between Kizil-Arvat and Gawars (an area Stuart called &quot;Daman-i-Kuh&quot;), and the Merv (today Mary) Teke, mainly between the Tejen and Murghab Rivers. Edmund O&#x27;Donovan described Merv as of 1881 as 
:...a heap of melancholy ruins. There are remains of baths, and palaces, and ramparts crumbling around, with nothing living but snakes and jackals to be seen, or perhaps some wandering Turkoman looking out for his sheep...This is all that remains of Merv...
O&#x27;Donovan also asserted that as of 1881 
: The Turkomans of Merv have only been twenty-six years in the oasis. They formerly inhabited the district around Sarakhs on the upper part of the Tejend river. They were driven from there twenty-seven years ago by the Persians, who objected to the neighbourhood of persons so disagreeable as to insist in carrying off Persian men, their wives, and daughters, and selling them at 5&quot;L&quot; per head in Bokhara.

===Russian Empire===
Following Russia&#x27;s defeat of the combined Ahal and Merv Teke army at the Battle of Geok-Tepe in 1881, Russian forces sought to pacify and occupy the area of today&#x27;s Mary Region. Merv was taken in 1884, followed by Kushka (today&#x27;s Serhetabat) in 1885. The latter precipitated the Panjdeh incident and very nearly a war between Russia and Great Britain, which feared Imperial Russia intended to push on through Afghanistan into India. A spur of the Trans-Caspian Railway was extended to Kushka, both to allow delivery and supply of troops guarding the border with Afghanistan, and to haul out cotton produced in the Murghab River valley.

===Soviet period===
Following the Russian Revolution, Soviet power was fully in place by 1924, when the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic was created. The name &quot;Merv&quot; was changed to &quot;Mary&quot; in 1937. The region initially was directly under control of the Turkmen SSR government, but in 1939 Mary &quot;oblast&#x27; &quot; (, ) was created. It was abolished in 1963, then re-established in 1970.

<text>WHA (970 AM) is a non-commercial radio station, licensed since 1922 to the University of Wisconsin and located in Madison, Wisconsin. It serves as the flagship for the Wisconsin Public Radio &quot;WPR News Network&quot;. WHA&#x27;s programming is also broadcast by FM station WERN in Madison. The station airs a schedule of news and talk programs from Wisconsin Public Radio, NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC.

The same call letters are used by WHA-TV in Madison, the flagship station for PBS Wisconsin.

== Broadcast frequencies ==

WHA transmits on 970 AM from a 258-foot tower at Silver Spring Farm within the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum. It operates at 5,000 watts during the day. Although WHA&#x27;s tower is relatively short by modern broadcasting standards, its transmitter power and Wisconsin&#x27;s flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity) gives it a daytime coverage area comparable to that of a full-power FM station. It decently covers much of south-central Wisconsin during the day, providing at least secondary coverage as far south at Rockford, Illinois and as far east as the Milwaukee suburbs.

The station must significantly reduce its power at night in order to protect Class A (clear-channel) CBW in Winnipeg at neighboring 990 kHz from interference. It drops down to 265 watts half an hour after sunset, then to 97 watts until an hour after sunset, when it must transmit at 51 watts for the remainder of the night. This results in severely limited coverage even within Madison itself, and renders it all but unlistenable outside the city. During the winter, early spring, late summer, and fall, it is allowed to ramp up to 434 watts pre-sunrise before beginning full-power operation at sunrise.

To increase its nighttime availability and audio clarity, WHA&#x27;s programming is relayed by two FM translators, plus the HD digital subchannel of a third FM station. Translator W300BM, operating on 107.9 FM to provide coverage to downtown and eastern Madison, including the UW-Madison campus, was officially part of the license of Milwaukee Ideas Network station WHAD until 2009, when it was transferred to the WHA license. In early 2013, FM sister station WERN, flagship of WPR&#x27;s News and Classical Network, added a WHA simulcast on its third HD subcarrier. At that time, translator W213CE, transmitting on 90.5 FM, and also licensed to Madison, was transferred to the license of WERN and began repeating WHA by way of WERN&#x27;s HD3 signal. That translator had previously been part of the license of WHHI in Highland in Iowa County, and provides coverage to the western Madison region. WHAD&#x27;s main signal covers portions of eastern Madison; WHAD is licensed to Delafield, a western suburb of Milwaukee, and its transmitter is located almost equidistant between Milwaukee and Madison.

W300BM&#x27;s transmitter was moved to the WISC-TV/WMSN-TV/WHA-TV candelabra tower on Madison&#x27;s west side in the fall 2018. While the translator&#x27;s power was reduced from 250 to 170 watts, its higher antenna position on the tower allows it to cover all of Dane County. It can be heard as far as Baraboo and Portage with a good radio. This had the effect of reducing the number of radio preset assignment slots used in an average day commuting around Madison, especially for those without an HD Radio in their office, home and vehicle; according to WPR officials, it was now possible for an Ideas Network listener to &quot;tune your radio to 107.9 and leave it.&quot; The W215AQ translator remains active from the same tower. The translators allowed WHA to be heard clearly in some form across much of Madison&#x27;s inner ring 24 hours a day. WHA is also relayed in the Janesville-Beloit area via translator W262DD on 100.3 FM.

As part of a major realignment of WPR&#x27;s offerings to take effect on May 20, 2024; WHA and WERN will become the flagships of the WPR News Network, successor to the Ideas Network. The translators will air the all-classical WPR Music network. However, this will substantially improve coverage of NPR news programming in Madison, since WERN penetrates further into south-central Wisconsin than the two translators. As the station&#x27;s signal is already widely available through analog FM translators and WERN as HD Radio subchannel, WPR shut down the AM HD Radio transmitter for the station at the same time.

== History ==

Randall Davidson, while researching the history of WHA for his 2007 book, &quot;9XM Talking&quot;, found that &quot;a breathtaking amount of material has been preserved from the station&#x27;s early decades.&quot; However, &quot;the research notes and personal papers of WHA founder Earle M. Terry are not available.&quot; They were disposed of by his widow after his death.

===Pre-World War I (9XM)===
WHA was first licensed as a broadcasting station on January 13, 1922, to the Department of Physics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. However, prior to this the university had extensive experience in radio experimentation and broadcasting, with the initial transmissions using Morse code, followed by pioneering audio broadcasts.

Radio (then known as wireless telegraphy) experimentation began at the university in the first decade of the 1900s. In 1914, Electrical Engineering department professor Edward Bennett constructed a spark gap transmitter, which was only capable of transmitting the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. The following year this equipment was transferred to physics professor Earle M. Terry, and Terry worked with a group of physics and engineering students to construct additional radio apparatus in the basement of Science Hall, including stringing an antenna between that building and the Mining and Metallurgy Laboratory.

In June 1915 the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at the time, issued the university an experimental radio station license, with the call sign 9XM. 9XM was initially used for point-to-point communication with other stations. Additional activities included sending game reports for a Wisconsin-Ohio State basketball game on February 17, 1917, and, beginning the following April, a telegraphic news exchange with other universities.

Starting in 1914 radio stations located at the University of North Dakota, Nebraska Wesleyan University, and the University of Nebraska established radiotelegraphic broadcasts of weather forecasts on a regular schedule, as a service for local farmers. Beginning in 1915, Eric R. Miller, a former student of Professor Terry&#x27;s who was the meteorologist in charge of the U.S Weather Bureau&#x27;s Madison office, worked with Terry to make arrangements for 9XM to provide a similar service for the state of Wisconsin. On December 1, 1916, it was announced that 9XM would begin to transmit daily (except Sundays) weather forecasts, using Morse code. These transmissions were made at 11:00 a.m. Central Time on a wavelength of 1,700 meters (176 kHz), and were scheduled to immediately follow the time signals transmitted from 10:55 to 11:00 a.m. by NAA, the U.S. Navy station in Arlington, Virginia.

The use of Morse code somewhat limited the usability of these broadcasts, as it required farmers to learn how to translate the telegraphic dots-and-dashes. Vacuum tube transmitters, capable of audio transmissions, had recently been developed, and in early 1917 Terry began making test transmissions using the new technology. For one of these tests he hosted a gathering at his home to listen to a transmission of phonograph records, although at the time the guests were generally unimpressed with hearing music that could just as easily be played on a nearby record player. But because vacuum tube technology was still in the experimental stage, 9XM did not introduce regular audio broadcasts at this time.

===World War I (wartime authorization)===

With the entrance of the United States into World War I in April 1917, the U.S. government assumed control of the entire radio industry, and it became illegal for civilians to possess a working radio receiver. At the same time all civilian radio transmitters, including 9XM, were shut down, ending the radiotelegraphic weather reports for the duration of the war.

Although 9XM had been silenced, in May, at the recommendation of A. Hoyt Taylor, district communication superintendent at the Great Lakes Naval Station in Illinois, the university was permitted to reactivate radio operations, now under the supervision of the U.S. Navy. (During the war, the Navy issued new call signs to the stations under its control, but there is no information about what call signs were used by the university transmitters during this period.) Station facilities were relocated from Science Hall to Sterling Hall, where the studios remained until 1934.

The research that took place during the war was done in secret. After the war, it was revealed that university staff had tested radio communication with submarines, in addition to working with the Army Signal Corps to develop radiotelephones for aviation use. The university also provided radio technology training classes for Signal Corps recruits. Additionally, weather information was transmitted to ships operating on the Great Lakes.

Professor Terry continued work on developing vacuum-tube transmitters, and in March 1919 announced that audio transmissions had been successfully made from Madison to the Great Lakes station, using &quot;a vacuum power tube which is said to be better than any commercial bulb&quot;.

===Post World War I (9XM and WHA)===

After World War I, the U.S. government relinquished its control of radio, and in October 1919 lifted the ban on civilian radio stations. In the fall of 1919, the university was authorized to operate a &quot;War Department Training and Rehabilitation School&quot; station with the call sign &quot;WX3&quot;, and on February 11, 1920, received an Experimental station license that revived the 9XM call sign.

Work soon began to re-establish the daily weather forecast broadcasts. In January 1920, reports from both the Weather Bureau&#x27;s Eric R. Miller and the university&#x27;s physics department stated that the transmissions would soon restart, this time by radiotelephone. However, when the service was reintroduced in February, the forecasts were still being sent only in Morse code. During the university&#x27;s summer break the weather forecast broadcasts were temporarily suspended, then restarted in September.

A key problem delaying the upgrade to audio transmissions was a lack of vacuum tubes. They were produced by the physics department, in a process that required glass-blowing skills. Finally, on January 3, 1921, the radiotelephone equipment was ready, and for the first time spoken word weather broadcasts were made. (Because telegraphic sounds can be heard for greater distances than spoken word, until 1923 the audio broadcasts were then repeated in Morse code.) Weekly Friday night musical concerts were introduced later that same month.

Initially there were no formal standards for stations providing a broadcast service, so there was no problem with 9XM broadcasting under an Experimental license. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce adopted regulations defining a broadcast service. The new regulations specified two transmitting wavelengths — 360 meters (833 kHz) for &quot;entertainment&quot;, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for &quot;market and weather reports&quot; — and also required stations making broadcasts intended for the general public to hold a &quot;Limited Commercial&quot; license. Professor Terry filed an application for the new license, and on January 13, 1922, the university was issued its first broadcasting station authorization, with the randomly assigned call letters of WHA. In addition to the two broadcasting wavelengths, the station was authorized to use 410 meters (731 kHz) &quot;for intercommunication between college stations&quot;.

For a few more years the university continued to renew the 9XM experimental license, which was used for conducting investigative work, until late 1926, when the license was permanently deleted. Wisconsin Public Radio commemorates 9XM in its fund-raising efforts, recognizing network donors who give more than $1,200 annually as members of the &quot;9XM Leadership Circle&quot;.

As it struggled to establish itself, issues with funding, available staff, and technical problems limited WHA&#x27;s schedule. The station suspended operations during the university&#x27;s 1922 summer break, then, because of technical difficulties, was unable to restart regular broadcasting until January 8, 1923. After again suspending operations for the 1924 summer break, the station was formally deleted by the government on September 8, although it was relicensed, again with the call letters WHA, on October 14.

Although the Great Depression caused many college radio stations to go silent because of financial pressures, in 1930 the state of Wisconsin began providing both WHA and WLBL in Stevens Point with funding to further their educational offerings. In the fall of 1931, the Wisconsin School of the Air provided 10 weekly programs designed to supplement grade school curricula. Other programs addressed government, agricultural, and homemaker audiences.

In 1927, the Federal Radio Commission was created to regulate U.S. radio stations, and the new agency implemented a series of frequency reassignments. Effective April 26, 1929, WHA was assigned to transmit on 940 kHz, but was required to sign off at sundown.

The station&#x27;s longest-running program, &quot;Chapter a Day&quot; has aired since at least 1932 and may have originated in the late 1920s according to some accounts.

In the summer of 1932, WHA relocated its transmitter a couple of miles (3 kilometers) south to its current site at Silver Spring Farm. This site had been used by the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; station, WISJ, but was no longer needed after that station merged operations with &quot;The Capital Times&quot; station, WIBA.

In 1934, WHA studios were relocated from Sterling Hall to Radio Hall, an 1880s vintage heating plant building. In 1972 the studios moved again, to Vilas Communication Hall.

In 1936, WHA installed a custom-built transmitter. In 1951, the station retired this transmitter and purchased a 5,000-watt Westinghouse transmitter. The custom-built transmitter had operated for over 52,000 hours.

On March 29, 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, WHA, along with the other stations on 940, moved to its current dial position of 970 kHz. However, it was still required to sign off at sundown. The lack of nighttime hours limited WHA&#x27;s potential programming even after the creation of what is now Wisconsin Public Radio in 1948. With this in mind, when the state began building the network of FM stations that evolved into WPR, it opted to have Milwaukee-area station WHAD licensed to Delafield, halfway between Milwaukee and Madison, in order to provide nighttime service to part of Madison when WHA was required to sign off. WHA made several unsuccessful attempts over the years to be assigned to a clear-channel frequency, or at least to a better dial location that would have enabled it to remain on the air at night.

The Canadian series for children, &quot;The Friendly Giant&quot;, was created in 1953 on WHA. The show, starring Bob Homme, later moved to local sister station WHA-TV before making its way to Canadian television on the CBC Television network. The long-running dramatic radio series &quot;Earplay&quot; was created by WHA in the fall of 1971.

In December 1987, after almost 60 years of efforts to remain on the air after sundown, WHA was authorized to commence nighttime operations. However, it had to reduce its power to 51 watts at sundown. This effectively limits its coverage area to Madison itself and its closest-in suburbs in Dane County, and even in that area the station is barely listenable. The problem was first alleviated with low-power translators, then with HD Radio subcarriers after the turn of the millennium. In addition, a number of WHA&#x27;s sister stations provide some coverage of the Madison area at night.

==Pioneer broadcasting station status==

Although WHA&#x27;s license only dates from January 13, 1922, its broadcast history is commonly combined with the earlier audio broadcasts made by experimental station 9XM. A plaque installed in 1958 on the university&#x27;s Madison campus credits &quot;9XM-WHA&quot; as &quot;The Oldest Station in the Nation&quot;, stating that it began &quot;broadcasting on a regular schedule in 1919&quot;. However, the 1919 starting date has been challenged. In 1960, a review carried in the &quot;Journal of Broadcasting&quot;, &quot;Oldest Station in the Nation?&quot;, concluded that there is no evidence for regular audio broadcasts by 9XM prior to its inauguration of spoken word weather forecasts on January 3, 1921. A second article appearing in 1977 in the same journal, &quot;Broadcasting&#x27;s Oldest Stations: An Examination of Four Claimants&quot; by Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross came to the same conclusion, as did Randall Davidson&#x27;s 2007 detailed station history, &quot;9XM Talking&quot;. Moreover, on at least two occasions WHA&#x27;s original station manager, Earle M. Terry, credited KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which began broadcasting as 8ZZ on November 2, 1920, as being the oldest surviving station. Other stations that make claims for being older than both 9XM/WHA and 8ZZ/KDKA include KCBS in San Francisco, California, which traces its history to a number of predecessor stations operated by Charles Herrold dating back to 1912; 8MK/WWJ in Detroit, Michigan, which began regular broadcasts in August 1920; WOC in Davenport, Iowa, which traces its origin to station 9BY, which began regular broadcasts around September 1920; and 9ZAF/KLZ in Denver, Colorado, with regular programs beginning in October 1920.

The University of Minnesota&#x27;s WLB (now KUOM) received its first broadcasting license on the same day as WHA, January 13, 1922. Although at this time there was no differentiation between commercial and non-commercial stations, these were the first two broadcasting licenses issued to educational institutions. The licenses were not time-stamped, however WLB&#x27;s serial number, Limited Commercial license #275, was one less than WHA&#x27;s #276. Comparing audio broadcasts conducted by the two universities&#x27; experimental license predecessors, 9XM&#x27;s January 3, 1921 inauguration of weather forecasts preceded, by a few months, the market broadcasts made by the University of Minnesota&#x27;s 9XI, which began in the spring of 1921.
