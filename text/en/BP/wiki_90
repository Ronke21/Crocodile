<text>Polka Dot Door is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series which was produced by the Ontario Educational Communications Authority (later known as TVOntario) from 1971 to 1993. The series features two hosts who speak directly to the home viewing audience.

The content of the shows was generally geared towards education and creativity. Each week of episodes focused on a single theme with each weekday assigned a different &quot;motif&quot; in which the theme was explored in different ways (For example, Tuesdays were &quot;Dress-Up Day&quot; in which the hosts would use costumes to explore the theme).

One of the most well-known elements of the series was the &quot;Polkaroo&quot;, a mythical character whose name combines the words &quot;polka dot&quot; and &quot;kangaroo&quot;. Normally played by the male host in costume, the Polkaroo would appear to the female host to perform a mime; upon the second host&#x27;s return, he would typically express disappointment when informed that he had once again missed the Polkaroo. In earlier years, the Polkaroo appeared just once per week on &quot;Imagination Day&quot;, but due to the character&#x27;s popularity, additional appearances were added later in the show&#x27;s run.

Another feature of the show was &quot;looking through the polka-dot-door&quot;, usually on &quot;Finding-Out Day&quot;, when the camera would zoom in to a special dot on the door, which would open up to reveal a short educational film.

==Creation and history==
&quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; was created and developed by a team of employees from TVOntario, hired and led by original series producer and director Peggy Liptrott.

Significant contributors to the creation and development of the series in 1971 included executive producer Vera Good, who laid the conceptual foundation of the show, educational supervisor Marnie Patrick Roberts, educational consultant L. Ted Coneybeare, script writers and composers Pat Patterson and Dodi Robb, animator Dick Derhodge (who designed the familiar opening/closing animation) and Dr. Ada Schermann, a professor at the prestigious Institute of Child Study in Toronto who was consulted in the early stages of &quot;Polka Dot Door&#x27;s&quot; development and is responsible for giving the show its name.

New episodes of &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; originally aired on TVOntario Monday to Friday beginning in the fall of 1971 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1993, with reruns running in constant rotation both on weekdays and weekends well into the 1990s.

The show itself was an adaptation of the BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Play School&quot;. Initially many aspects and concepts of &quot;Play School&quot; were licensed by TVOntario for use on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, including designs of some of the stuffed animals used in the show, which were similar to those used in &quot;Play School&quot; as well as educational film inserts/segments which were shown to viewers &quot;Through the Arched Window&quot; on &quot;Play School&quot; and &quot;Through the Polka Dot Door&quot; on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;.

Dodi Robb helped distinguish &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; with her creation and addition of the Polkaroo, combining the show&#x27;s title with the word kangaroo. Polkaroo would reprise his role every Thursday (Imagination Day), appearing to only one of the two hosts (the other dressing up and playing the role of Polkaroo). In the late-1970s, then-producer Coneybeare led negotiations to dissolve TVOntario&#x27;s licensing agreement with &quot;Play School&quot;, freeing &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; to be distinctively Canadian and adapt to include more Canadian educational content.

Robb and Patterson co-composed the theme song that accompanied the opening/closing animation used for the series&#x27; entire run, and wrote many of the early scripts and songs used in the series, including &quot;Imagine, Imagine&quot;, a song often used on Imagination Day with Polkaroo. Robb would go on to be the first-ever head of children&#x27;s programming at CBC Television, and would have Muppet &quot;Dodi&quot; in &quot;Sesame Park&quot;, a Canadian adaptation of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, named in her honour.

The theme song was performed by Angela Antonelli, born December 29, 1933, in Guelph, Ontario. Left home at the age of 16 to Study voice under Dr. Ernesto Vinci at Royal Conservatory of Music, Joined the Canadian Opera Company and Starred in Gianni Schicchi opposite Jon Vickers, Gretel in Hansel &amp; Gretel &amp; Marriage of Figaro among others. She was a regular on the Juliet Show for 6 seasons as well as many other radio and television shows. Original cast member of Anne of Green Gables at the Charlottetown Festival and went on to perform in many other theatrical shows.

==Producers, musicians and hosts==
During the course of the series&#x27; run, &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; had three producers who significantly contributed to the development of the show: original producer-director Peggy Liptrott (1971), L. Ted Coneybeare (1972–1984), and Jed MacKay (1985–1993). MacKay began as a writer and composer for &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; in the 1970s. He went on to create and produce two multi-award-winning series for TVOntario, &quot;Join In!&quot; and &quot;Polka Dot Shorts&quot;. The accompanying background music throughout the show was played &quot;live to tape&quot; by Canadian pianists Herbie Helbig (1971–1984) and John Arpin (1985–1993).

Each episode of &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; had two human hosts, always one man and one woman. There were more than fifty hosts over the course of the series. Each pair of hosts was contracted for one week&#x27;s worth of episodes, with many hosts and pairs reprising their role over multiple weeks, though not necessarily with the same co-host. Most hosts during MacKay&#x27;s time as producer were contracted for two to three weeks worth of episodes (10–15), with the exception of Carrie Loring, Johnnie Chase, and Cindy Cook, who hosted every year MacKay produced (1985–1993) as well as the two one-hour specials. Typically 25–35 episodes were produced each summer during the course of the series, depending on the available funds in TVOntario&#x27;s programming budget. Many aspiring Canadian actors and actresses got their start on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;, and went on to do notable work in North American television, film, and theatre.

In addition, many hosts worked on other educational shows produced by TVOntario, including Heather Conkie (&quot;Dear Aunt Agnes&quot;, &quot;Report Canada&quot;, &quot;Music Box&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Mainly Music&quot;), Nerene Virgin (&quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;), Nina Keogh (&quot;Readalong&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;, &quot;Bookmice&quot;, &quot;The Magic Library&quot;) Rex Hagon (&quot;The Science Alliance&quot;), and Alex Laurier (&quot;Cucumber&quot;). Cindy Cook was the longest serving female host appearing on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; between 1981–1993, making her one of the most recognizable hosts from the series. She is also the only host to have worked with two producers of the show, first with Coneybeare (from 1981 to 1984) and then with MacKay (from 1985 to 1993).

==Format==
&quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; was taped and broadcast in blocks of five episodes a week that would feature the same two hosts each day. Each five-day week had a specific theme and emphasis. However, within that theme, each day of the week had its own theme that was consistent throughout the entire series:
* Monday was &quot;Treasure Day&quot;
* Tuesday was &quot;Dress-Up Day&quot;
* Wednesday was &quot;Animal Day&quot;
* Thursday was &quot;Imagination Day&quot;
* Friday was &quot;Finding-Out Day&quot;
In order to create trust and familiar routines with young children, &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; was scripted with specific &#x27;events&#x27; that were particular to each day of the week:
* Treasure Day: Hosts would retrieve the stuffed animal toys from a toy box (in the shape of a polka dot house) while singing a specific &#x27;hello&#x27; song. In addition, they would often discover an unexpected &#x27;treasure&#x27; (usually found materials or a toy) from the purple (later blue) treasure box that sat nearby the story time rocking chair. 
* Dress-Up Day: Hosts would open the &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; closet to reveal dress-up clothes, pretending to be the people they were dressing up as. They would often have a &#x27;reason&#x27; to dress-up themselves, the toys or the set.
* Animal Day: Hosts would go outside to the barn where activity with the &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; pets or &quot;guest pets&quot; would take place. There were five regular &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; pets represented on the show throughout the series. Although the specific pets changed, they retained the same names for the entire series.
* Imagination Day: Hosts would place an emphasis on fantasy, encouraging viewers to use their imagination. This was the only day in which Polkaroo appeared, almost always being played by one of the hosts.
* Finding-Out Day: Hosts would facilitate specific scientific discoveries on this day or reexamine themes from previous days of the week from a different standpoint. Every Finding-Out day would conclude with the hosts returning the toys back to their toy box while singing a specific &quot;goodbye&quot; song. The final camera shot seen before the final credits would be the hosts exiting through the large polka dot door.

Another regular event on &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; was Storytime, which featured in each programme. This involved the host teaching and telling the time on a large, oversized blue (later pink) grandfather clock and featured the appearance of a small stuffed animal named &quot;Storytime Mouse&quot;. Often Storytime Mouse would be engaged in some activity related to that day&#x27;s story.

Although Storytime happened in every episode, it was often at different, unpredictable times. Whatever activity was happening on the show would be interrupted by a sequence of chimes indicating that it was time to tell the time together and hear a story. The hosts would stop whatever activity they were doing and go to the grandfather clock to tell the time and then read a story in an adjacent rocking chair specifically used for this purpose on the show. Helbig and Arpin would provide instrumental piano accompaniment, often accenting the moods and themes represented in the story being told.

Depending on the emphasis, there would be a &quot;song of the week&quot; that would often be reprised every day, helping viewers to solidify the emphasis of that week&#x27;s theme. Many of the songs in the early years of the program were composed by the script writers themselves. When MacKay, an accomplished composer, took over as producer from 1985 to 1993, he composed many of the songs used in the series during that time.

==Characters and toys==
The hosts would lead young children in songs and stories, and interact with stuffed animal characters Humpty, Dumpty, Marigold, and Bear. These characters did not speak or move; the hosts would let the audience know what they were saying; for example, one of the hosts would say &quot;What&#x27;s that Marigold? You would like...&quot; In the 1980s, a stuffed cat named Minou was added, which introduced viewers to simple words and phrases in French. On certain theme days the hosts would invite the audience to peer through the Polka Dot Door to witness an educational video of some sort, showing, for instance, how crayons are made.

==Legacy and awards==
In 2010, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television gave &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; a Masterworks award, calling it a &quot;groundbreaking children&#x27;s educational series&quot; that &quot;changed the nature of children&#x27;s television programming&quot; and &quot;impacted countless young Canadians and raised the international profile of the Canadian television industry.&quot;

==One-hour specials==
Only two one-hour specials have aired in the history of &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot;; these shows consist of five hosts (two male, three female) and the Polkaroo portrayed by unknown host.

Polkaroo&#x27;s Birthday Party: This was used to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Polka Dot Door, as well as cameos from other hosts in the past.

Polkaroo Goes To Camp: This was used to commemorate the finale of the series; this is also the only show in the history of &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; not to have storytime.

==Polkaroo==
Each day&#x27;s episode had a particular theme. Monday was &quot;Treasure Day&quot;, Tuesday was &quot;Dress-Up Day&quot;, Wednesday was &quot;Animal Day&quot;, Thursday was &quot;Imagination Day&quot;, and Friday was &quot;Finding Out Day&quot;. On &quot;Imagination Day&quot;, the character Polkaroo (sometimes referred to as &quot;the Polkaroo&quot;) appeared. The actor playing Polkaroo donned a tall, green plush costume that resembled a kangaroo. In its mended, yellow and multi-coloured polka-dot muumuu, the creature spoke using various repeated exclamations of its own name accompanied by elaborate gestures. The meaning of this pantomime was to be guessed by the audience. This was usually followed by a song whose lyrics began &quot;Imagine, imagine, you can imagine Polkaroo...&quot;. In the first two seasons, Polkaroo would appear to one of the hosts while the other host was absent for some reason. The co-host would return upon Polkaroo&#x27;s departure, habitually exclaiming, &quot;The Polkaroo was here?!? And I missed him &quot;again&quot;?!?&quot; Both hosts took turns as the Polkaroo. Starting in the third season, only the male host donned the Polkaroo costume.

In the late 1990s, TVOntario capitalized on the success of Polkaroo by placing him and the other animal characters, now also actors dressed in costumes, in a new series, &quot;Polka Dot Shorts&quot;, which also had its own catchphrase moment, as each episode included the unlikely discovery of a pair of polka dot shorts, leading to the exchange:

Following the end of &quot;Polka Dot Shorts&quot;, Polkaroo also appeared in the children&#x27;s series &quot;Gisèle&#x27;s Big Backyard&quot;.

The Polkaroo costume as seen above and on the original series was handmade in Toronto by Tanya Petrova, an immigrant artist from Toronto who made brief appearances on numerous television shows from &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot; to &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Petrova also created 24 puppets, including Charlie Horse and Lionel for Shari Lewis, as well as costumes for Ontario Place theme park, Eaton&#x27;s (for example, Glump) and other events and attractions.

There were several other versions of the Polkaroo costume as well: the one with the long slender neck was built by Lorraine Cramp in 1982. She also made the Moose and Beaver costumes for &quot;Cucumber&quot;, the Sidney the Kangaroo costume for &quot;Math Patrol&quot;, and the Subterranean Monster costume for &quot;Mathmakers&quot;.

==Parodies==
The 1980s Canadian sketch-comedy show &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;, starring real-life husband and wife team Steve and Morag Smith, used to parody the &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; with a recurring sketch called &quot;The Kids Show&quot;, with male and female hosts who loathed each other and bickered their way through the sketch. The sketches also featured the &quot;Jerkaroo&quot;, played by Steve Smith with a paper bag over his head.

The 1989 UK-Canada co-production &quot;EMU-TV&quot; featured a recurring parody called &quot;The Door with Spots All Over It&quot;.

A Canadian sketch-type educational television show called &quot;Bod TV&quot;, which focuses on nutrition education and is also produced by TVOntario, has a parody of &quot;Polka Dot Door&quot; called &quot;Polka Dot House&quot; as one of its sketches. The sketch plays as a combination of the television show with reality television series &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In it, one of the hosts gets tired of Bear repeatedly making honey sandwiches for everyone day in day out, and schemes with Marigold to get Bear out of the kitchen so she can prepare a meal that provides a more balanced diet.

In 2018, a rally in Toronto&#x27;s Trinity Bellwoods Park to celebrate the legalization of cannabis in Canada saw the appearance of &quot;Tokaroo&quot;, a marijuana-smoking parody of Polkaroo. Tokaroo was created by Mark Scott, an actor who had once been directly employed by TVOntario to play Polkaroo in live promotional appearances, and the network threatened him with legal action. Scott also has a longer history of creating Polkaroo variants in his contemporary work as a children&#x27;s educator, including Rainbowroo to discuss LGBTQ issues, Signaroo to educate children about hearing impairment and sign language, and Readyroo to educate children about disability and special needs.

<doc id="485022" wikidata="Q5176965" url="?curid=485022" title="Counterfeit banknote detection pen">
<text>A counterfeit banknote detection pen is a pen used to apply an iodine-based ink to banknotes in an attempt to determine their authenticity. The ink reacts with starch in wood-based paper to create a black or blue mark but the paper in a real bill contains no starch, so the pen mark remains unchanged.

==Background==
Counterfeit banknote detection pens are used to detect counterfeit Swiss franc, euro and United States banknotes, amongst others. Typically, genuine banknotes are printed on paper based on cotton fibers and do not contain the starches that are reactive with iodine. When the pen is used to mark genuine bills, the mark is yellowish or colourless.

Such pens are most effective against counterfeit notes printed on a standard printer or photocopier paper. The chemical properties of US banknotes printed before 1960 make marking pens useless, resulting in false positives. One example of this complication taking place happened in 2016, in which a 13-year-old student was arrested by police after she attempted to pay for lunch with a red seal Series 1953 $2 bill after the school&#x27;s counterfeit pen was unable to prove its authenticity.

==Reception==
Pen manufacturers claim such pens will detect a great majority of counterfeit bills and are an easy counterfeit detection method that does not require expensive gadgets.

===Critical reception===
Critics suggest the effectiveness is much lower. Critics claim that professional counterfeiters use starch-free paper, making the pen unable to detect the majority of counterfeit money in circulation. Magician and skeptic James Randi has written about the ineffectiveness of counterfeit pens on numerous occasions and uses a pen as an example during his lectures. Randi claims to have contacted a United States Secret Service inspector and asked whether the pen works as advertised, to which the inspector replied &quot;it is not dependable.&quot; The Secret Service does not include such pens in their guidelines for the public&#x27;s detection of counterfeit US currency.

US counterfeiters bleach small denominations and print more valuable bills on the resulting blank paper to evade this test, although changes to the currency since 2004 have made this method easier to detect. This is one reason that many currencies use different sized notes for different denominations.

====False positives====

The effectiveness of the pens may be affected by external methods. Simply having a banknote pass through laundry, depending on the soaps and bleaches used, can cause a bill to fail the test when it is otherwise accepted. Additionally, it was discovered that treating a counterfeit note with a dilute solution of vitamin C will cause a false negative: that is, it will respond to the iodine-based ink as though it were made of the same paper as a valid banknote.

<text>Statistics New Zealand (), branded as Stats NZ, is the public service department of New Zealand charged with the collection of statistics related to the economy, population and society of New Zealand. To this end, Stats NZ produces censuses and surveys.

==Organisation==
The organisation&#x27;s staff includes statisticians, mathematicians, computer science specialists, accountants, economists, demographers, sociologists, geographers, social psychologists, and marketers.

Stats NZ is divided into seven organisational subgroups, each managed by a Deputy Government Statistician:
* Macro-economic and Environment Statistics studies prices, and national accounts, develops macro-economic statistics, does government and international accounts, and ANZSIC 06 implementation (facilitating changeover to new classification code developed jointly with Australian statistics officials.)
* Social and Population Statistics studies population, social conditions, standard of living, and census, and has a census planning manager as well as statisticians helping to develop new social statistics measures.
* Standards and Methods studies statistical methods, statistical education, and research, solutions and capabilities, information management, and develops new methodologies.
* Collections and Dissemination services clients. There is one general manager in Christchurch and one in Auckland. It develops products and services and manages publishing and customer services.
* Organisation Direction maintains contacts with key government officials, does internal audits and business planning, manages international relations and the Official Statistics System (OSS), and advises on Māori affairs.
* Industry and Labour Statistics studies business indicators, finance and performance, agriculture, energy and work knowledge and skills.
* Organisation Development focuses on services for the agency itself, including information technology management, quality assurance, application development and support, finances, corporate support, and human resources.

Many of the agency&#x27;s powers, duties, and responsibilities are governed by acts of the New Zealand Parliament. The agency is a state sector organisation of New Zealand operating under the authority of the Statistics Act 1975.

== Responsibilities and activities ==
The department conducts the New Zealand census every five years. The census is officially done on one day. The most recent released census was in 2018 (the first data from the 2023 census is due for release on 29 May 2024). The count of &quot;usual residents&quot; (excluding visitors from overseas) from the 2018 census was 4,699,755. they lived in 1,664,313 occupied dwellings; their median age was 37.4 years (half older, half younger); 775,836 identified themselves as &quot;Māori&quot; (16.5% of the population); people had a median income of $31,800. This is a main source of information, and data collected from this census is often used for further purposes within the department as well as serving as benchmark information for numerous reports and surveys. For example, the census asks about the main means of travel to work, but by combining this with data from transport surveys, the department can issue detailed reports such as &quot;Commuting Patterns in New Zealand: 1996–2006&quot;, with specific inferences such as &quot;Over half of people who walked or jogged to work lived within 2km of their workplace.&quot; This information is helpful for business purposes, government decision-making, media purposes, foreign policy, journalism, public information, planning, and for many other uses. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New Zealand uses statistics from this agency about prices and wages to help develop economic indicators, exchange rate information, and the official cash rate.

The department supplies a wide variety of information. It reports on labour costs, incomes, civil unions and marriages, employment, electronic card transactions, food prices, retail trade, births and deaths, prices of capital goods, overseas trade, screen industry, international visitor arrivals, overseas merchandise, agriculture and fish stocks, water resources, building consents, electronic card transactions, English language providers, wholesale trade, local authority information, balance of payments data, manufacturing surveys, commuting patterns, mapping trends, culture and identity statistics, housing trends, work stoppages, gross domestic product, industrial energy use, and the list goes on and on. In addition, it analyses trends and publishes forecasts. The agency does not involve itself with political polling generally.

The agency provides information to the public. Many surveys and reports are available free of charge on its website; users can download spreadsheets electronically. In addition, some private market research firms use the agency&#x27;s vast database information as source material, combining it with value-added presentation software (such as sophisticated mapping programs), and then sell the re-packaged information.

Information from demographers is used as source material by journalists for articles. Sometimes statistics can influence public policy. For example, Stats NZ demographers in 2008 spotted a trend of fewer women having children and wrote: &quot;Deciding not to have children happens as a consequence of other life events... Education, career, mortgages, changes in family and partners for many couples, childlessness is what happens while they are making other plans.&quot; Their report was picked up by journalists at the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; to form the basis of an article with the headline &quot;New Zealand women stop having babies&quot;. The article discussed ramifications, such as possible workforce shortages and increased cost of elderly care, as well as possible policy actions such as a &quot;Working for Families&quot; program. Newspaper headlines can influence public opinion which may impact policy decisions. Stats NZ information is used by government to explore tough problems; a research paper dated April 2009 used agency statistics when exploring how to handle gang violence.

Agency data is quoted by a wide variety of sources, even in the footnotes of books. For example, in &quot;Connecting the Clouds – the Internet in New Zealand&quot;, author Keith Newman cites agency statistics regarding telecommunications cost decreases (the Stats NZ report said &quot;New Zealand average residential phone call pricing plummeted 50% between 1987 and 1993&quot;) and national finances (the Stats NZ report said &quot;The current account deficit for the year ended March 2007 was $13.9 billion (8.5 percent of GDP)&quot;). Data is used to help retailers spot trends and act accordingly. A newspaper article on decreased do-it-yourself (DIY) retail spending in 2008 quoted an agency source: &quot;Figures from Statistics New Zealand show DIY spend has been tracking down with the retail sector.&quot; This information helps businesses adjust to new realities. Radio programs such as &quot;Radio New Zealand National&quot; have quoted agency data.

Some agency policies result in controversy. One gay activist felt Stats NZ was &quot;breaking the law&quot; by omitting a question on the 2006 census regarding sexual orientation; the article in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; elaborated &quot;Mr. van Wetering and the Office of Human Rights Proceedings, the independent legal branch of the commission, expect to discuss the inclusion of the (sexual orientation) question in the 2011 Census with lawyers for Statistics New Zealand later this year.&quot; There were some indications that the agency was seriously considering including a question on sexual orientation. The agency did focus groups exploring this possibility. Sometimes controversies involve disputes over whether agency data was cited properly. One blogger, claiming to be a former Wellingtonian journalist who identifies himself or herself as &quot;Poneke&quot;, accused the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; of publishing misleading data about crime statistics. Poneke noted that “Statistics New Zealand now provide(s) the ability to query the New Zealand Police Statistics – allowing you to gather detailed crime information about your local area since 1994.” The blogger felt the agency was &quot;impeccably impartial&quot;, but distrusted various media sources.

One way the agency makes data available to the public is by offering a &quot;Table Builder&quot; tool. It lets users access specific information from past surveys, and collect it into a customised set of data. 

The following counts were derived by using Statistics New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Table Builder&quot; tool:

Statistics New Zealand develops statistical classifications and standards and works with the corresponding national statistical offices with such nations as Australia, the United States, and Canada. It conducts ongoing research regarding the viability of these standards. Since the early 2000s, it has begun using the &quot;Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupation&quot; to describe a wide variety of jobs; for example, the code 111111 describes a chief executive or managing director, while the code 531111 describes a general clerk. By using standardised codes, high speed computers can sift and sort through large databases to produce summary reports.

It also provides technical assistance to developing countries in the Pacific rim, with a special focus on Pacific Island nations.

Statistics New Zealand is acknowledged as the statistical authority within government. While other branches of government generate statistics, Statistics New Zealand works with them to expedite the information as well as provide consulting services when appropriate. It is responsible for the first integrated programme of Official Social Statistics. It provides assistance, guidance and oversight to other government agencies regarding statistics when appropriate. For example, it works with the New Zealand Health Information Service regarding their management of statistical information – a downloaded spreadsheet showed there were 65,120 live births registered in 2007 in the nation, and the table listed Statistics New Zealand as a source of this information. It worked with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage to collect and publish cultural data.

==Vision==
The department&#x27;s &quot;aim is that New Zealand increasingly gets the statistical information it needs to grow and prosper&quot;.

The organisation&#x27;s stated values are statistical excellence, integrity, confidentiality and data security, leading, connecting, and communicating. It says on its website: &quot;By following these values, we aim to deliver accessible, relevant, and timely statistics for all New Zealanders.
Confidentiality is not only a policy chosen by the department but required by law. A section of the Statistics Act 1975 reads &quot;No information from an individual schedule is to be separately published or disclosed [Section 37(3)], except as authorised by the Statistics Act (the act permits others to see information from an individual schedule, but only when it is in a form that prevents identification of the respondent concerned, and then only under strict security conditions). This means government cannot abuse personal information from a census by revealing (or threatening to reveal it) for dubious purposes. For example, a particular person&#x27;s income responses cannot be handed over to a tax collection agency.

The agency maintains an open copyright policy stating that, apart from images and content with specific copyright statement, users are free to use the work provided that Statistics New Zealand is attributed.

==Methods==
Statistics New Zealand uses many methods to collect, process, analyse, and publish data. The agency has statisticians and mathematicians and survey experts whose chief duty is to examine how the agency approaches various projects and to suggest ways to improve efficiency, speed, and accuracy.

Some projects require advanced statistical tools to make sense of misleading data. For example, sometimes seasonality distorts data. &quot;For example, in retail trade, December is a very high month due to Christmas sales. If we compare November sales with December sales, we will report an increase in sales. But this increase is largely due to seasonal fluctuations and is not an informative measure&quot; according to a description from their website. To prevent seasonal variables from distorting data, statisticians sometimes use complex programs, including X-12-ARIMA (derived from census bureaus from the US and Canada), to remove seasonal distortions. So, with the December sales bump removed, the seasonally adjusted retail sales data can reveal the &quot;true underlying trend&quot;—are sales going up, holding steady, or declining? This is important information for retailers.
While the census counts every person, the department also conducts surveys based on only a small sample of people. These samples are scientifically selected to represent the larger group. For example, the General Social Survey chooses a select number of households, approximately 8,000, which represent the nation as a whole, and surveys them every two years. Interviewers with laptops conduct face-to-face interviews, and the result is information about &quot;social wellbeing&quot; including &quot;housing, health, paid work, social connectedness, and human rights. It sometimes conducts specialty surveys about a specific industry or topic. For example, it published a biotechnology survey, based on a 10-page questionnaire developed by the agency, using scientific samples to choose respondents; the 2007 results can be downloaded to computers via the Internet. This particular report uses a long list of variables, such as &quot;total exports&quot; and &quot;biotechnology exports to Asia&quot; and &quot;stage of development of biotechnology processes&quot;.

Statistical techniques such as sampling and weighting can reduce data gathering expenses while surveying, although it requires careful attention by statisticians. For example, census counts are rather straightforward in a statistical sense since it is a straight count of bodies, purchases, opinions, actions. But it is expensive to interview everybody. And there are many non-census topics requiring further study which the agency is asked to do. One way to reduce costs is by selecting smaller samples which hopefully represent the population being studied. This is a highly cost-effective way to get accurate information. Choosing a good sample sometimes requires complex statistical work to make sure the sample is, indeed, truly representative of the population under study. If conditions do not permit representative sampling but known benchmark statistics are known (possibly from earlier census data), it is still possible to generate accurate information by &quot;weighting the data&quot; to &quot;distort it back&quot;, so to speak, to compensate for the distortion caused by the unrepresentative sample. For example, suppose an area of Wellington has a known percentage of women—say 53% – which is believed to be accurate from a previous census count; a study is done a few years later; a sample is chosen; questionnaires are processed; but of the returning questionnaires, 57% are women. It is possible statistically to give men slightly greater weight to account for the discrepancy, and the result is more accurate data. The agency discusses different methodologies on its website. A statement explains why weighting is sometimes necessary: &quot;Statistics New Zealand is improving the methodology used for the 2001 Household Economic Survey through the use of integrated weighting. This is a relatively recently developed method of adjusting the statistical output of a survey to match population benchmarks. In particular, it takes account of under coverage in the survey of specified population groups. Integrated weighting improves the robustness and accuracy of survey estimates. It also reduces the effect of bias in estimates resulting from under coverage, as well as reducing the level of sampling error for benchmark variables.&quot;
All statistical work presents opportunities for error, but it is possible to reduce error to manageable amounts. A statement reads: &quot;An important aim of our ongoing work is to understand, manage, control and report on all known sources of error... which simply reflect the inherent variability that exists among the units we are seeking to measure... This variability manifests itself in &quot;sampling error&quot; when we use samples for cost-effectiveness reasons to estimate characteristics about a population. Sampling errors are relatively easy to measure... Other sources reflect process, measurement and inference errors, and are referred to as &quot;non-sampling error&quot;. It is not possible to eliminate all sources of error. However, our continued efforts at understanding and managing variability and error ensure we are exercising a high level of control on all known sources of error.&quot;

What greatly facilitates statistical accuracy by reducing non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers) and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal questions such as wage and salary information. But people must answer these questions and will not be paid for their time. It is required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person does not get a census survey for any reason, he or she is still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government cannot be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.

Legislation states census forms must be &quot;filled in and signed within a stated time&quot; and returned &quot;within a stated time to the Department&quot;.

Extensive use is made of the Internet to publish key information. Users can sift through vast databases to learn about a wide variety of topics. A user can learn that &quot;89% of businesses use broadband to connect to the Internet&quot; or that &quot;145 babies were born on Mother&#x27;s Day in 2008&quot;. Entire reports can be downloaded as .pdf files and printed on one&#x27;s computer.

==History==

In the nation&#x27;s early days, with a small population and before the advent of powered transportation and modern telecommunications, there was little need for statistics nor ability to create them. In the colonial years, sometimes magistrates and police officials collected data as part of their work. After about the 1890s, the official information source presented to the public was called the &quot;New Zealand Official Yearbook&quot; compiled from various departments. Sometimes data about animals were collected (a census of poultry ceased in 1971); one census taker on horseback drowned while crossing a river. In 1956, the newly created Department of Statistics had 164 employees. Tabulating techniques improved. One source writes: &quot;As both New Zealand&#x27;s population and the complexity of the information sought grew, so did the size of the army of temporary clerks that was employed every five years by the Census and Statistics Office to process it. Sitting at long tables, they added, subtracted and calculated percentages. From the 1890s census data was written on cards which were sorted by hand. 

The drudgery of statistical work was gradually eased as adding and calculating machines and typewriters came into use, operated mostly by women. Tabulating machines were imported from the United States in the 1920s to process punched cards; this too was women&#x27;s work,&quot; according to a book written by David Green in 2002. The agency grew in size. Tabulating machines were replaced by mainframe computers, then microcomputers, then the Internet. &quot;Since the early 1980s computing has been done in-house, and in the 1990s personal computers and the Internet revolutionised the day-to-day experience of work at Statistics New Zealand,&quot; according to Green&#x27;s book.

Management positions have changed over time as well. The post of &quot;Government Statistician&quot; was created in 1910 within the Registrar-General&#x27;s Office, before a separate Census and Statistics Office was set up in 1913. Before 1910 most statistics for the colony or dominion as a whole were the responsibility of the Registrar-General himself.

The well-regarded economist J.B. Condliffe worked at the agency after First World War, but no fully qualified mathematicians until after the Second, when in-house training in statistical methods also began. Since 1910, the post of Government Statistician has been held by different persons. From 1955 until 1994 the agency was known as the &quot;Department of Statistics&quot; until the name was changed to the current one.

The agency has grown in size and sophistication from its early beginnings. As times change, information needs change accordingly. For example, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, politicians became interested in the concept of sustainable development. The agency found ways to measure these trends to provide helpful information for planners. In August 2002, it published its first report on Sustainable Development Indicators, which measured variables such as water quality, energy usage, sustainability of cities, and youth development. 
 Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said in 2003 &quot;...the growth we have must be sustained over a number of generations. Therefore, we need to plan for that growth so that we don&#x27;t add to our problems.&quot; As the department moves into the future, and if the past is an indication of the future, it is likely to continue its trajectory of larger size, more responsibility, increased technical sophistication via Internet and broadband tools.

The 2011 national census was cancelled due to the disruption and displacement of people caused by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The census was rescheduled and took place on 5 March 2013.

On 13 August 2019, the Chief Statistician Liz MacPherson resigned following the release of a report criticising the department&#x27;s handling of the 2018 New Zealand census. Due to a decision to conduct the census solely online, the 2018 Census only attracted an 83% response rate, well short of the 94% Census percent target and a nine percent drop from the previous 2013 Census.

On 21 May 2024, Statistics New Zealand announced that it would not renew the lease for its Auckland office at Greys Avenue building due to staff safety concerns in the Auckland CBD. Key issues including anti-social behaviour around the building&#x27;s entrance and surrounding street.

<text>The &quot;Virginia&quot; class of pre-dreadnought battleships were built for the United States Navy in the early 1900s. The class comprised five ships: , , , , and . The ships carried a mixed-caliber offensive battery of four and eight guns; these were mounted in an uncommon arrangement, with four of the 8-inch guns placed atop the 12-inch turrets. The arrangement proved to be a failure, as the 8-inch guns could not be fired independently of the 12-inch guns without interfering with them. Additionally, by the time the &quot;Virginia&quot;s entered service, the first &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleships—including the British —were nearing completion, which would render mixed battery ships like the &quot;Virginia&quot; class obsolete.

Nevertheless, the ships had active careers. All five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909. From 1909 onward, they served as the workhorses of the US Atlantic Fleet, conducting training exercises and showing the flag in Europe and Central America. As unrest broke out in several Central American countries in the 1910s, the ships became involved in police actions in the region. The most significant was the American intervention in the Mexican Revolution during the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914.

During the American participation in World War I, the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class ships were used to train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In September 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, though Germany surrendered two months later, ending the conflict. After the war, they were used to bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships&#x27; careers short. &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; were sunk in bombing tests in 1923, and the other three ships were broken up for scrap later that year.

==Design==
The United States&#x27; victory in the Spanish–American War in 1898 had a dramatic impact on battleship design, as the question of the role of the fleet—namely, whether it should be focused on coastal defense or high seas operations—had been solved. The fleet&#x27;s ability to conduct offensive operations overseas showed the necessity of a powerful fleet of battleships. As a result, the US Congress was willing to authorize much larger ships; the &quot;Virginia&quot;s, three of which were authorized on 3 March 1899, were the first of these new ships. Two more were authorized on 7 June 1900, with the displacement for all five ships proposed at , a significant increase over previous designs. Initial design work, which began with a memorandum issued on 12 July 1898, called for a battleship based on the , to be armed with four 12-inch guns, sixteen guns, and ten guns, protected with a 12 in belt of Krupp armor, and capable of steaming at .

Arguments over the projected displacement and armament prevented further work until October 1899. Captain Charles O&#x27;Neill argued for a mixed battery of 12 in and guns with superposed turrets, while Phillip Hichborn, the chief constructor at the Bureau of Construction and Repair, preferred a design armed uniformly with guns instead of the mixed battery. The decision was made to adopt the mixed battery, since the 8 in gun could penetrate the medium armor on foreign battleships that protected their secondary batteries. Captain Royal Bradford, the chief of the Bureau of Equipment, suggested that 18.5 knots would be sufficient, though O&#x27;Neill demanded ; a compromise was found by requiring a minimum of . These compromises produced two variants: &quot;A&quot;, which arranged the 8 in guns in four twin turrets amidships as with the , and &quot;B&quot;, which placed two of the four turrets atop the 12 in turrets, as on the . The &quot;A&quot; design included sixteen 6 in guns in casemates, while &quot;B&quot; had only twelve.

The Board on Construction initially favored &quot;A&quot;, though one officer on the board rejected the design so strongly that the Secretary of the Navy ordered a second, larger board to be formed to examine the two designs. Eight line officers were added to the board; this group favored the superposed turrets of &quot;B&quot;. One of the members, Rear Admiral Albert Barker, suggested to build the first three ships to &quot;A&quot; and the last two to &quot;B&quot;. The board initially approved the idea, but the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance rejected it in favor of uniformity of design. The Secretary of the Navy convened a third board to settle the matter, and ten of the twelve members voted for &quot;B&quot;. The finalized design was approved on 5 February 1901.

The superposed turrets ultimately proved to be very problematic; the arrangement had been conceived initially to save weight and allow the much faster firing 8 in guns to shoot during the long reload time necessary for large caliber guns. By the time the &quot;Virginia&quot;s entered service, smokeless propellant and rapid firing, large caliber guns had reduced the time between shots from 180 seconds to 20. The 8 in guns could no longer fire at their maximum rate without interfering with the 12 in guns, since the concussion and hot gasses would disrupt the crew below. In addition, the British —the first &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship to enter service—commissioned in late 1906 shortly after the &quot;Virginia&quot;s and rendered them obsolescent at a single stroke.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Virginia&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ships had a high metacentric height, which made them unstable even in moderate seas. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. As built, the ships were fitted with a pair of heavy military masts with fighting tops, but they were replaced by cage masts in 1909. They had a crew of 40 officers and 772 enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at . Steam was provided by coal-fired water-tube boilers; in &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot;, they were equipped with twenty-four Niclausse boilers, while the other three ships received twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. These were trunked into three funnels amidships. The engines generated a top speed of . By 1919, &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot; had their Niclausse boilers replaced with twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The ships carried of coal, which allowed them to steam for a designed cruising radius of at a speed of . In service, they could actually steam for . The ships were equipped with electricity generators with a combined output of .

===Armament===

The ships were armed with a main battery of four 12-inch/40 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The turrets were Mark V mounts, which allowed for reloading at all angles of elevation. These mounts could elevate to 20 degrees and depress to −7 degrees. Each gun was supplied with sixty shells.

The secondary battery consisted of eight 8-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns and twelve 6-inch/50 caliber Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 8-inch guns were the Mark VI type, and they fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . They were supplied with 125 shells per gun. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. The 6-inch Mark VI guns fired a shell at .

For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried twelve 3-inch/50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, the &quot;Virginia&quot; class carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside. They were initially equipped with the Mark I Bliss-Leavitt design, but these were quickly replaced with Mark II, designed in 1905. The Mark II carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
&quot;Virginia&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and elsewhere. It extended above the waterline and below. The main battery gun turrets (and the secondary turrets on top of them) had thick faces and thick roofs. For the main battery turrets, their sides were 8 in thick, while the superposed turrets had reduced protection on their sides, at 6 in of armor plating. The supporting barbettes had the of armor plating. The two waist turrets had thick faces, 6 in thick sides, and 2 in thick roofs. Six inch thick armor plating protected the casemate guns. The conning tower had thick sides and a 2 in thick roof. The ships&#x27; decks ranged in thickness from and they were sloped on the sides to connect with the lower edge of the main belt.

==Service history==
All five ships of the class served with the Atlantic Fleet for the majority of their careers. In 1907, &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Georgia&quot;, and &quot;New Jersey&quot; took part in the Jamestown Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. The five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–09, though &quot;Nebraska&quot;, which had been built on the west coast of the United States, joined the fleet after it had reached California in 1908. The fleet left Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 and steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.

The ships then began a peacetime training routine off the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean, including gunnery training off the Virginia Capes, training cruises in the Atlantic, and winter exercises in Cuban waters. In late 1909, &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Georgia&quot;, and &quot;Rhode Island&quot; visited French and British ports. Throughout their careers, political unrest in several Central American countries prompted the United States to send the ships to protect American interests in the region. &quot;New Jersey&quot; was sent to Cuba to assist the Cuban Pacification in support of the government of President Tomás Estrada Palma. All five ships became involved in the Mexican Revolution as the United States intervened to protect its nationals living in the country, culminating in the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. &quot;New Jersey&quot; was also sent to protect American interests in Haiti and the Dominican unrest in 1914.

In July 1914, World War I broke out in Europe; the United States remained neutral for the first three years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The &quot;Virginia&quot;-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the &quot;Virginia&quot;s were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.

The ships—thoroughly obsolete by this time—were briefly retained in the post-war period before being decommissioned. &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Georgia&quot;, and &quot;Rhode Island&quot; were transferred to the Pacific Fleet, with the latter serving as the flagship of the 1st Squadron, though they were all out of service by 1920. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in 1922, they were to be discarded as part of the naval armament limitation program. &quot;Virginia&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; were sunk as target ships off Cape Hatteras by Army bombers under the supervision of Billy Mitchell in September 1923. The other three ships were sold to ship breakers in November that year.

<text>The &quot;Connecticut&quot; class of pre-dreadnought battleships were the penultimate class of the type built for the United States Navy. The class comprised six ships: , , , , , and , which were built between 1903 and 1908. The ships were armed with a mixed offensive battery of , , and guns. This arrangement was rendered obsolete by the advent of all-big-gun battleships like the British , which was completed before most of the &quot;Connecticut&quot;s entered service.

Nevertheless, the ships had active careers. The first five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909—&quot;New Hampshire&quot; had not entered service. From 1909 onward, they served as the workhorses of the US Atlantic Fleet, conducting training exercises and showing the flag in Europe and Central America. As unrest broke out in several Central American countries in the 1910s, the ships became involved in police actions in the region. The most significant was the American intervention in the Mexican Revolution during the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914.

During the American participation in World War I, the &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class ships were used to train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In late 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, and in September that year, &quot;Minnesota&quot; was badly damaged by a mine laid by the German U-boat . After the war, they were used to bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships&#x27; careers short. Within two years, all six ships had been sold for scrap.

==Design==
The United States&#x27; victory in the Spanish–American War in 1898 had a dramatic impact on battleship design, as the question of the role of the fleet—namely, whether it should be focused on coastal defense or high seas operations—had been solved. The fleet&#x27;s ability to conduct offensive operations overseas showed the necessity of a powerful fleet of battleships. As a result, the US Congress was willing to authorize much larger ships. Design work on what would become the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class began in 1901. The Secretary of the Navy submitted a request for a new battleship design on 6 March to the Board on Construction. Among the issues considered was the composition and placement of the secondary battery. The preceding design, the , placed some of its secondary guns in fixed turrets atop the main battery turrets as a way to save weight. The Board disliked the arrangement, as some members argued that guns in casemates could be fired faster. Additionally, the &quot;Virginia&quot;s had mounted a mixed secondary battery of and guns; the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) had recently introduced a quick-firing gun, which was more powerful than the 6-inch and fired faster than the 8-inch.

The initial version of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; design, proposed by BuOrd, featured a secondary battery of twenty-four 7-inch guns with the same number of guns for defense against torpedo boats. The armor layout was more comprehensive but thinner, and displacement rose to . BuOrd determined that a longer and finer hull shape, coupled with a small increase in engine power, would maintain the standard speed of . The Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) proposed a ship more closely based on the &quot;Virginia&quot;s, with the same two-story turrets and mixed 6- and 8-inch secondary battery, on a displacement of . This design featured only eight 3-inch guns, which was deemed wholly insufficient to defend the ship from small craft.

In November, the Board agreed to a compromise design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8-inch guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7-inch guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8 in guns was in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed with the performance of the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a transverse bulkhead, weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.

The last four ships, starting with , received slightly improved armor protection, with the last vessel——having further improvements. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Vermont&quot; class. The six &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class ships were the most powerful pre-dreadnought type battleship built by the US Navy, and they compared well with contemporary foreign designs. They were nevertheless rendered obsolescent almost immediately by the advent of the &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship epitomized by the British . Two follow-on ships, the , were built at the same time to a design based on the &quot;Connecticut&quot;s but significantly reduced in size.

===General characteristics and machinery===

The &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class ships were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . Freeboard forward was . They displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ships had a flush deck, and they were better sea boats than preceding designs, many of which had poor stability. The &quot;Connecticut&quot; class had a metacentric height of . As built, the ships were fitted with two heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. They had a crew of 42 officers and 785 men.

The ships were powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines, with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The engines were rated at and generated a top speed of . The boilers were trunked into three closely spaced funnels amidships. The first five ships were equipped with eight electricity generators, while &quot;New Hampshire&quot; had four of these generators and two units. All of the ships had a combined output of ; this was the highest output in any American warship then built. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The ships&#x27; turning radius was at a speed of .

On trials, the ships exceeded their design speed slightly, with being the fastest, at . The ships carried of coal normally, but additional spaces could be used for coal bunkers, with storage capacity ranging between for each ship. At a cruising speed of , the ships could steam for , though &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s engines were more efficient, allowing her to steam for at the same speed.

===Armament===
The ship was armed with a main battery of four /45 caliber Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft, as was typical for battleships of the period. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The turrets were Mark VI mounts, which allowed for reloading at all angles of elevation. These mounts could elevate to 20 degrees and depress to -5 degrees. Each gun was supplied with sixty shells. &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s magazines were rearranged compared to her sisters, which allowed for her to carry 20 percent more 12- and 7-inch shells, though under normal conditions she carried the same load.

The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 caliber guns and twelve /45 caliber guns; this mixed battery proved to be problematic, as shell splashes from the two types could not be distinguished. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin Mark XII turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. The 8-inch guns were the Mark VI type, and they fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . The 7-inch Mark I guns fired a shell at 2,700 ft/s. These guns were later removed during World War I and converted for use on tracked gun carriages in France. The outfit per gun was 100 shells for both types.

For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried twenty /50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. They also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class carried four  torpedo tubes, submerged in their hulls on the broadside. Each ship carried a total of 16 torpedoes. They were initially equipped with the Mark I Bliss-Leavitt design, but these were quickly replaced with Mark II, designed in 1905. The Mark II carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
The first two ships&#x27; main armored belt was thick over the machinery spaces and reduced to abreast of the main battery turrets. This portion of the belt was long and wide. On either end of the ship, the belt then thinned, first to , then to and finally to at the bow and stern. The last four ships&#x27; belts were reduced to a uniform 9 in between the main battery, with no change to the ends. The armored deck was thick amidships, where it was partially protected by the belt and casemate armor. It had 3 in thick sloped sides, which connected to the bottom edge of the belt. The deck was increased to 3 in forward and aft, where it was directly exposed to shellfire, also with 3 in thick sloped sides. &quot;New Hampshire&quot;″s belt was slightly shortened to permit a thicker deck over the magazines. Each ship&#x27;s conning tower had 9 in thick sides and a thick roof.

The main battery gun turrets had 11 in thick faces, with 9 in thick sides and thick roofs. The supporting barbettes had the of armor plating, reduced to . The secondary turrets had of frontal armor, with 6 in on the sides and 2 in on the roofs. Their barbettes were given 6 in of armor plating on the outboard sides and 4 in inboard. The casemates for the 7-inch guns were 7 in thick and below the gun ports, the casemates reduced slightly to 6 in. For the last four ships, the savings in weight gained by reducing the thickness of the belt were used to increase the lower casement armor to 7 in. Those for the 3-inch guns were 2 in thick. The 7-inch guns were divided by splinter bulkheads that were thick to prevent one shell hit from disabling multiple guns.

==Ships==
==Service history==
All six ships of the class served with the Atlantic Fleet for the duration of their careers. The first five ships took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909. The fleet left Hampton Roads on 16 December 1907 and steamed south, around South America and back north to the US west coast. The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, which had not been completed in time to take part in the journey, met the fleet there during a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.

The ships then began a peacetime training routine off the east coast of the United States and the Caribbean, including gunnery training off the Virginia Capes, training cruises in the Atlantic, and winter exercises in Cuban waters. In late 1909, all six ships crossed the Atlantic to visit British and French ports. &quot;Louisiana&quot; and &quot;Kansas&quot; made another trip to Europe in early 1911. As political unrest began to erupt in several Central American countries in the 1910s, the ships became increasingly active in the region. All six ships became involved in the Mexican Revolution, including the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914; &quot;Vermont&quot; and &quot;New Hampshire&quot; were among the ships that contributed landing parties to the initial occupation of the city. Several men from the two ships were awarded the Medal of Honor during the action.
In July 1914, World War I broke out in Europe; the United States remained neutral for the first three years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, &quot;New Hampshire&quot; and &quot;Louisiana&quot; were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, &quot;Louisiana&quot; was used to test Arthur Pollen&#x27;s Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.

From late 1918, the ships were used to escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, &quot;Minnesota&quot; struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat &quot;U-117&quot;, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German surrender in November; thereafter, the &quot;Connecticut&quot;s were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.

==Early life==
Andrea Martin was born on January 15, 1947, in Portland, Maine, the eldest of three children of Armenian-American parents Sybil A. (; ) and John Papazian Martin (; 1917–2010). Her paternal grandparents, from Van, present-day Turkey, had escaped the Armenian Genocide. Her maternal grandmother immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 15. Her paternal grandfather, an amateur thespian, changed the family&#x27;s name from Papazian to Martin.&lt;ref name=&quot;armeniansofmaine/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal grandparents, who were from Constantinople, started the Armenian School at the Chestnut Street Church in Portland, Maine. Andrea&#x27;s father owned Martin&#x27;s Foods, a grocery-store chain. She has mentioned that although her grandparents &quot;did not know what assimilation was,&quot; her parents worked hard to assimilate into the U.S. As such, Martin only connected with her ancestry later in life.

When she was two years old, her mother was recovering from a broken leg, so she would often read to her daughter. She and her mother would often take turns reading Shakespeare, &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;, and Edgar Allan Poe’s &quot;The Raven&quot;. She took piano lessons when she was eight, reciting a poem about a kitten at the rotunda of the Portland Museum of Art and playing the piano there. Martin transferred from Nathan Clifford School to St. Joseph’s Academy before entering high school. She graduated from Deering High School in 1965, where she was a member of the Dramatic Club and won Miss Deering High 1965.

==Career==
Soon after graduating from Emerson College, Martin won a role in a touring company of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;. After frequent visits to Toronto, she relocated from New York City to Toronto in 1970 and immediately found steady work in television, film, and theater.

In 1972, Martin played the character Robin in a Toronto production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, with a company that included future stars Gilda Radner, Martin Short, Eugene Levy, and Victor Garber, and musical director Paul Shaffer. Two of her early film roles were in horror films, 1973&#x27;s &quot;Cannibal Girls&quot;, for which she won the Sitges Film Festival Award for Best Actress, and in 1974, as the bookish sorority sister Phyllis in &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, a Canadian slasher.

In 1976, she joined then-unknowns John Candy, Dave Thomas, Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Harold Ramis, and Joe Flaherty on the Canadian sketch comedy television series, &quot;SCTV&quot;, which was set at fictional television station &quot;Second City Television&quot;, or SCTV, in Melonville. Martin most notably portrayed leopard print-wearing station manager Edith Prickley, whose dealings with the staff, including president/owner Guy Caballero, clueless newscaster Earl Camembert, and washed-up actor Johnny LaRue, helped to provide much of the show&#x27;s humor. Other notable characters Martin played included Pirini Scleroso, an immigrant from Eastern Europe, organ saleswoman Edna Boil, feminist TV show host Libby Wolfson, and children&#x27;s entertainer Mrs. Falbo. Her talent for impersonation was key in her humorous portrayals of Barbra Streisand, Ethel Merman, Arlene Francis, Pauline Kael, Sally Field, Sophia Loren, Beverly Sills, Lynn Redgrave, Linda Lavin, Bernadette Peters, Liza Minnelli, Connie Francis, Mother Teresa, Joni Mitchell, Alice B. Toklas, Patti Smith, Brenda Vaccaro, and Indira Gandhi. In 1981, Martin was Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Show for her work in &quot;SCTV&quot;.

Her 1970s stage work eventually included the Toronto branch of the improvisational comedy troupe The Second City, a group which produced almost the entire cast of &quot;SCTV&quot;. In 1992, she made her Broadway debut in the musical &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, for which she won the Tony Award, Theatre World Award, and Drama Desk Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

Her additional Broadway credits include &quot;Candide&quot; (1997) and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (2002), and the Broadway premiere of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (2007), all of which brought her Tony Award nominations for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

Martin starred alongside Geoffrey Rush and Susan Sarandon in the Broadway revival of &quot;Exit the King&quot;. For her performance as Juliette, she was nominated for a Drama Desk and an Outer Critics Circle Award. She wrote and performed in the critically acclaimed one-woman show &quot;Nude, Nude, Totally Nude&quot; in Los Angeles and New York City, receiving a 1996 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One Person Show.

Her other theater credits include the leads in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; and &quot;Betty&#x27;s Summer Vacation&quot;, for which she won the Elliot Norton Award for Best Actress, both produced at the Huntington Theatre in Boston. During the winter of 2012–2013, she played Berthe, Pippin&#x27;s grandmother, in the American Repertory Theater production of &quot;Pippin&quot; in Cambridge, Massachusetts, singing the classic song &quot;No Time At All&quot;. The show transferred to Broadway at the Music Box Theatre and opened in April 2013. For &quot;Pippin&quot; Martin won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical, the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Martin&#x27;s last performance as Berthe in the Broadway production of &quot;Pippin&quot; was on September 22, 2013. She appeared on Broadway in the new play written and directed by James Lapine, &quot;Act One&quot;, for which she received the Outer Critics Circle Award.

Martin played Wanda Falbo the Word Fairy in a series of short segments on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, debuting in 1989. The character was based on Mrs. Falbo, one of Martin&#x27;s &quot;SCTV&quot; characters. She also appeared on &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; as the executive producer of a low-rated cable channel, which was spun-off into her own CBS series, &quot;Roxie&quot;. Martin is known to &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans as one of two actresses to play Ishka, Quark&#x27;s mother, in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

Martin has won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program in 1982 and 1983. She has done considerable voice work in animated film and television productions such as &quot;Anastasia&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Recess&quot;, &quot;The New Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;, &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;The Buzz on Maggie&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;. She also appeared in the 1993 television adaptation of &quot;Gypsy&quot; starring Bette Midler.

In 1997, Martin starred in the television series &quot;Life... and Stuff&quot;.

Her screen credits include &quot;All Over the Guy&quot;, in which she played Dr. Ellen Wyckoff—Dan Bucatinsky&#x27;s therapist mother, &quot;Club Paradise&quot;, &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Worth Winning&quot;, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;, &quot;Stepping Out&quot;, &quot;The Producers&quot;, and &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;, in which she portrayed Aunt Voula, a role she reprised in the small-screen adaptation, &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot;, the 2016 sequel, &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&quot; and &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3&quot; (2023).

In 2006, she played a major role in the remake of &quot;Black Christmas&quot;. She played Helaine in the 2009 breakout independent film &quot;Breaking Upwards&quot;. In the episode titled &quot;Pupil&quot;, she played an emergency room patient on the Showtime series, &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;, which was aired July 27, 2009. In 2012, she provided the voice of Penny in the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Stan&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; and appeared in an episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; titled &quot;My Whole Life Is Thunder.&quot; Martin appeared in &quot;Night at the Museum 3&quot; and Hulu&#x27;s original series, &quot;Difficult People&quot;, starring Billy Eichner and Julie Klausner, and produced by Amy Poehler. It premiered August 5, 2015. She played Prudy Pingleton on &quot;Hairspray Live!&quot;, which aired on December 7, 2016.

She appears in the NBC sitcom &quot;Working the Engels&quot;.

In late 2015 to early 2016, Martin performed as Dotty Otley in the limited-run Roundabout Theatre Company revival of &quot;Noises Off&quot;, directed by Jeremy Herrin. Martin was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance.

Martin tours throughout Canada and the United States in her one-woman show, &quot;Andrea Martin: Final Days, Everything Must Go!&quot; with her musical director Seth Rudetsky.

In 2018, Martin, along with fellow Canadians Seth Rogen and Leonard Cohen, was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Martin was set to perform on Broadway opposite Nathan Lane beginning March 2019 in the world premiere of Taylor Mac&#x27;s new comedy &quot;,&quot; directed by George C. Wolfe. On March 4, 2019, Martin withdrew from the production, having broken four ribs in an accident during rehearsal.

In 2024, Martin appeared on Broadway, in the Lincoln Center production of Ayad Akhtar&#x27;s McNeal, along with Robert Downey Jr., who played the title character.

<text>The &quot;Mississippi&quot; class of battleships comprised two ships which were authorized in the 1903 naval budget: and ; these were named for the 20th and 43rd states, respectively. These were the last pre-dreadnought battleships to be designed for the United States Navy, but not the last to be built, because one more ship of a prior design was completed later under the 1904 naval budget. While the quality and technology of the weaponry and armor were first-rate, these ships included a variety of main, intermediate, secondary, and tertiary gun sizes in a predreadnought configuration which became obsolete before the ships were completed.

The first several years of the 20th century were a period of confusion and transition in US naval strategy, tactics, and ship design. The &quot;Mississippi&quot; class, along with the preceding , were designed based on lessons learned in the Spanish–American War, but while they were under construction, the Russo-Japanese War, war games, and experimentation demonstrated new priorities and concepts which would influence future designs. This was also a period where rapid development of techniques and training in the use of large guns made the inclusion of rapid-fire intermediate and secondary weapons unnecessary. Future US designs would reduce the confusing array of guns sizes in predreadnought battleships and rely on one gun size for the main armament, the &quot;all-big-gun&quot; concept, along with many small guns of a uniform caliber to combat small vessels in close proximity.

The &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships were smaller than the several preceding classes of US battleships. They were designed in an attempt to reduce the rapid growth in the size and cost of U.S. battleships. Also, a theory existed among influential naval leaders, including Dewey and Mahan, that many small battleships could be strategically useful, as were small ships of the line in the 18th and 19th centuries. In essence, the &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships were smaller versions of the preceding &quot;Connecticut&quot; class with virtually the same armament and armor, but the reduction in length, engine size, and fuel capacity caused them to be slow and short-ranged. Other design compromises caused them to perform poorly in terms of steering, stability, and sea keeping.

These ships served in the US Navy from 1908 to 1914, when they were sold to Greece. Most US service was with the Atlantic Fleet, though these ships did not perform well in fleet operations due to their lower speeds and shorter ranges. The ships were frequently detached for special tasks, including goodwill tours, and &quot;Mississippi&quot; was used for a time as a seaplane support vessel. Both ships took part in US military interventions in Mexico and the Caribbean, including landing Marines and supporting early air operations.

In 1914, both &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships were sold to Greece, being renamed &quot;Kilkis&quot; and &quot;Lemnos&quot;; this was the only sale of functional US battleships to a foreign government. From 1914 to the early 1930s, the ships were active in the Greek Navy, serving mostly in coastal defense and attack roles. In these missions and in the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, their limitations were less pronounced. They served in the Russian Civil War and the Greco-Turkish War. By the mid-1930s, they were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles, and &quot;Lemnos&quot; (ex-&quot;Idaho&quot;) had her guns removed to bolster coastal fortifications. Both were sunk by German aircraft in 1941, and raised in the 1950s to be sold for scrap.

==Purpose==

In the early 20th century, the US Navy was growing rapidly. The Navy commissioned its first battleships in 1895, and by the middle of the next decade, Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships ranked its battle line second only to the British Navy. However, this rapid growth was not universally supported either within the government or within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary to get funding.

The &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships were designed to meet Congressional and Navy Department objectives of reducing the escalating cost of new battleships, the quantity, size, and cost of which had increased dramatically over the first two decades of US battleship production. 
A division occurred among US naval planners in the early years of the 20th century over whether to have technically superior ships or many less expensive ones, with President Theodore Roosevelt among those supporting the former and Admiral of the Navy George Dewey along with Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan supporting the latter approach.
The 1903 naval budget effected a compromise by calling for five ships: three more ships of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class and two ships of a new less expensive class of about , with the design still to be determined.

The ships that became the &quot;Mississippi&quot; class were intended to serve as the modern equivalent of 19th-century third-rate ship of the line, offering what was thought to be an efficient compromise between sailing ability (speed, handling), fire power, and cost. This concept had formed the backbone of the sailing battle fleets of the previous century, but trends in early 20th century naval strategies were making the third-rate concept obsolete. Prevailing strategies called for a consistent battle line of first-rate units.

==Design==
The &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class battleships were the last predreadnought US battleship class to be designed; however, , the last ship of the prior &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class design, was authorized and completed after these ships; therefore, it was the last US predreadnought ship to be built.

While Congress had authorized three vessels in the 13,000-long ton range, the design was not specified in the 1903 naval budget. Three approaches were initially considered: a scaled-down version of the preceding 16,000-long ton &quot;Connecticut&quot; class, five of which had been approved with the 1902 and 1903 budgets; a scaled-up version of the , an 1898 design, three of which were commissioned from 1902 to 1904; and a completely new design which might incorporate new ideas and technology. Interesting adaptations were considered for new designs,
and weight-saving technology could allow increased efficiencies to be achieved from the older &quot;Maine&quot; class design,
which was closest to the weight goal.

As with most US naval designs, coal storage and engine efficiency were more important than in European designs. US ships might have to fight far from their home shores, especially in the Pacific. Even in the Caribbean, US forces might be farther from their coaling stations than a European power with colonial bases. Draft was a concern, since southern US harbors tended to have shallow entrances, and some proponents felt that all ships should be able to egress all major harbors. Beams were typically limited by the width of dry docks.

===Armament===

In 1903, differing concepts of the ultimate combination of guns were available, with many ideas based on various experiences and interpretations from recent naval battles, war games, and other experimentation. Recent US battleship designs had included primary guns, intermediate guns, secondary guns, and tertiary guns, which were typical in the predreadnought configuration. In 1890, the US Navy had pioneered the use of intermediate guns with the , but had not used these consistently in their previous designs because opinions and experiences varied. 
The quality of guns, armor, ordnance, and design was changing rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat experience in the Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller guns at close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate. 
In the Russo Japanese War of 1904–1905, just six years later, decisive effects were obtained at long ranges, well beyond the effective limits of ordnance. However, by this point the designs were established for the &quot;Mississippi&quot; class and the keels had already been laid down.

====Main batteries====
Recent American designs had continued to include large primary batteries of either or guns, along with several intermediate 8-inch guns for faster fire in closer combat with armored vessels. The lighter intermediate guns were considered valuable for penetrating upper-level armor, where the heavy guns were more effective on the main belt and heavy turrets. The former were likely to diminish the fighting ability of the opponent, while the latter were more likely to sink her.

Earlier US battleships had used 13-inch guns with black powder propellant; the 1898 design of the &quot;Maine&quot; class used more powerful but smaller 12-inch guns using smokeless powder, giving a greater velocity and flatter trajectory. The 12-inch rifles available in 1904 had a range of , about double the range of the black powder main armament used in the Spanish–American War. These were considered an excellent compromise between weight and firepower, since limitations in gunnery control made longer-range guns impractical. The contemporary consideration was not whether to go larger, but whether to go with more. In 1902, naval officers, with the backing of President Theodore Roosevelt, began to develop superior fire control techniques and equipment. The development of better spotting and range finders led to improvements in range capacity and accuracy. At the same time, superior training and systems significantly reduced the time required to load and fire the large guns, from three minutes to one minute.

Intermediate 8-inch guns had been discontinued in 1896 with the &quot;Illinois&quot; class, but based on experience in the Spanish–American War in 1898, 8-inch/45-caliber guns were reinstated in the &quot;Virginia&quot; class and continued in the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class. Typically, these were carried in two-gun turrets, but the placement of the turrets had been inconsistent in prior designs; in two prior designs, the turrets for the 8-inch guns were superimposed over the turrets for the 12/13-inch guns (see and classes). Some designers felt that 8-inch guns were redundant to the faster firing 7-inch/45-caliber guns carried in casemates. Others argued that increases in the rate of fire and accuracy of the 12-inch guns eliminated the need for any smaller guns in the main battery.

====Secondary batteries====
In 1903, secondary batteries were typically considered to be a combination of torpedo defense—defense against smaller boats armed with torpedoes, such as torpedo boats or destroyers—and weapons to attack the lightly armored upper structures of capital ships.

Recent US warships had mounted a combination of a few 7-inch or 6-inch guns and many smaller guns in the to range (6-pounder to 12-pounder in the traditional terms). The larger of these guns were typically protected in casemates and the smaller ones open on the deck or in lightly protected casemates.

A fast-firing 7-inch/45-caliber gun had been adopted with the previous battleship class to replace earlier 6-inch guns; these brought a significant improvement in ballistics, expanding the potential beyond torpedo defense, but came with drawbacks. Various opinions on the best combination of guns existed: all 8-inch, all 7-inch, or a mix.
Though considered to be quick-firing, the propellant for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns. The Navy considered these to be excellent for the intended role; however, in World War I North Atlantic convoy duty, the disadvantages in seakeeping outweighed the utility; they were removed from battleships remaining in US service in 1918.

Beginning with the &quot;Maine&quot;-class vessels, commissioned in 1902, the 50-caliber gun (12-pounder) was used on most U.S. battleships as an antitorpedo-boat weapon. These and smaller weapons are frequently referred to as tertiary guns. This role was filled back to the earliest U.S. battleships, including the Texas and first Maine, by the 6-pounder . Most 3-in guns were removed from U.S. battleships before combat operations in World War I.
====Competing designs====
The future of battleship weaponry was at a crossroads. Opinions varied among top naval leaders; some U.S. naval leaders were discussing the all-big-gun concept in parallel with the British , while other designers felt that the torpedo would completely replace the gun, and battleships should become heavily armored launch platforms. Other proposals included even more but smaller primary guns, in the size to save on weight. In 1903, analysis of war games had determined that one battleship with 12 11-inch or 12-inch guns, in a hexagonal turret placement, could be superior to three conventional battleships in individual actions.

Other analysis suggested that in fleet actions, only broadsides were effective, thus maximizing the number of centerline guns was the most efficient approach. While neither approach was incorporated in the &quot;Mississippi&quot; class, the centerline maximum broadside concept was followed in all subsequent U.S. battleship designs.

====Final design====
In the end, these ships were built with main batteries identical to the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class, while reducing by four guns the secondary 7-inch battery, omitting eight of the tertiary 3-inch guns, and sacrificing two torpedo tubes. Subsequent designs would eliminate the 7-inch batteries completely, and most of the 3-inch guns were removed from other battleships before combat in World War I, so in this respect, the design did not suffer by comparing forward.

The main battery consisted of four 12-inch 45-caliber guns, meaning that the gun is 45 times as long as it is in diameter. These were considered quick-firing guns and were arranged in two twin turrets, one forward and one to the rear of the main superstructure. The eight 8-inch 45-caliber guns were arranged in four twin turrets outboard of the main superstructure on each side of the ship.

The remaining eight 7-inch 45-caliber guns were distributed four per side, in casemates on the side of the ship, below the main deck.

 Four 50-caliber guns were mounted in the upper casemates (on the main deck), two per side, behind of armor plate. Another two, one per side, were mounted in blister casemates on the gun deck, near the bow. The remaining eight guns were on open mounts on the upper deck, the bridge, and other deck spaces. Two submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the broadside, near the bow of the ships.

===Armor===

Prior to the mid 1870s, armor was made of wrought iron plate, sometime backed with wood. In the 1870s, compound armor was developed, where a hardened steel face was cemented to a softer iron backing, which prevented cracking. During the late 1880s, nickel-steel armor was devised and in 1890, the Harvey process was developed, where a nickel-steel plate was treated with carbon and hardened in cold water. This process allowed one homogeneous steel plate to have both a hard surface and a softer back which was less likely to crack. During the 1890s, Krupp armor further refined the Harvey process by including additional metals in the alloy and developing a system where the hardening process penetrated more deeply into the plates. Tests showed that of Krupp armor was equal to of Harvey armor, of compound armor, and of wrought iron plate, while in thinner plates, Harvey armor was basically equal to Krupp.

The &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships used a combination of Harvey- and Krupp-style armor (American-made), with much of the side armor backed with teak wood, consistent with other U.S. capital ships of the decade. The amount of armor and its strength was consistent with the preceding &quot;Connecticut&quot; class and in some cases was more complete in coverage and was thicker, especially compared to the earliest ships in that series. The belt armor was thinner, compared to , but longer, compared to , despite the &quot;Mississippi&quot; class being shorter, compared to . The primary turret armor was thicker by an inch— thick—as opposed to on the &quot;USS Connecticut&quot;.

===Machinery===

When these ships were designed, the older technology of reciprocating steam engines was slowly being replaced by the newer technology of steam turbine propulsion. While turbines generally meant more speed, they were less fuel-efficient and limited the range of the ships unless more fuel could be stored. Early &quot;Dreadnought&quot; designs, which were in simultaneous development with the &quot;Mississippi&quot; class, used primitive direct-drive turbines. The U.S. Navy was slow to fully adopt turbines, and only used them exclusively in battleship production when indirect transmissions became refined (gear reduction or turbo-electric). Several subsequent battleship classes were built where otherwise identical vessels had different types of engines (for example, the and es).

&quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Idaho&quot; were equipped with two-shaft vertical triple-expansion steam engines, which drove two propellers. These were reciprocating engines where the steam was used multiple times (triple expansion) for greater efficiency. Steam was provided by eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Their engines were rated at , which produced a top speed of . On trials, &quot;Mississippi&quot; reached and a maximum speed of . In terms of speed, this class of ships was inferior to several preceding classes, and was only slightly superior to the &quot;Illinois&quot; class which was laid down in 1896.

The ships carried of coal in purpose-designed coal bunkers and up to another of coal could be stored in voids in the sides of the hull. This provided the ships with a range of at a cruising speed of . The range was less than the previous class.

===General characteristics===
The final design was a scaled-down version of the preceding &quot;Connecticut&quot; class. By comparison, these ships were a knot slower and had a lower freeboard, so they did not perform as well in heavy seas. The two &quot;Mississippi&quot;-class ships were long overall, had a beam of and a draft of . The ships were designed to displace at normal displacement and up to at full combat load. Each ship had a crew of 34 officers and 710 enlisted men.

The World Cruise of 1907–1909 tested the seakeeping of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament too close to the waterline.
The ships initially carried a pole mast above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had lattice masts added aft, and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with lattice masts.

The reduced length while retaining the same beam as the prior &quot;Connecticut&quot; class resulted in a disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class. Not only was their top speed a knot slower, but also their economical speed was reduced by one and half knots. They also had 25% less coal storage, further reducing their operating range.

The &quot;Mississippi&quot; ships had poor seakeeping qualities, making them poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, which made it difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, made it difficult to keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.

==Ships==
===USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; (BB-23)===
The second &quot;Mississippi&quot; (Battleship No. 23) was laid down in 1904, launched in 1905, and commissioned in early 1908, She was given a shakedown cruise off the coast of Cuba in 1908, then returned to Philadelphia for final fitting out.

In early 1909, she attended the inauguration of the President of Cuba, met the Great White Fleet upon its return, and was reviewed by the President. For the remainder of the year and into 1910, she traveled the waters off New England, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico, took a voyage up the Mississippi River, and participated in war games out of Guantanamo Bay.

In late 1910, she sailed to Europe as part of Atlantic Fleet maneuvers, following which she spent about 14 months off the Atlantic coast, based alternately in Philadelphia and Norfolk, serving as a training ship and conducting operational exercises. In June 1912, she landed a Marine detachment at El Cuero, Cuba, to protect American interests. Following exercises with the fleet, she returned to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was put in the First Reserve in August 1912.

In late 1913, she was assigned duty as an aeronautic station ship at Pensacola, Florida. With the outbreak of fighting in Mexico in April 1914, &quot;Mississippi&quot; sailed to Veracruz, arriving with the first detachment of naval aviators to go into combat. In June 1914 she returned to Hampton Roads, where in July she was decommissioned and transferred to the Greek Navy.

===USS &quot;Idaho&quot; (BB-24)===

The second &quot;Idaho&quot; (Battleship No. 24) was laid down in 1904, launched in 1905, and commissioned in mid-1908. She was given shakedown cruise off the coast of Cuba in 1908, then returned to Philadelphia for final fitting out and repairs.

In the summer of 1908, she transported a detachment of marines to Colon in the Canal Zone to support a peaceful election process. 
In early 1909, she met the Great White Fleet upon its return to the U.S. and was reviewed by the President. For the remainder of the year and into 1910, she alternated between the waters off New England and southern waters, including the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, along with a voyage in the Mississippi River and war games out of Guantanamo Bay.

In late 1910, she sailed across the Atlantic with the Third Division of the Atlantic Fleet to Gravesend Bay, England, and then to Brest, France, returning to Guantanamo Bay in early 1911.

After routine service with the Atlantic Fleet and in Cuban waters, &quot;Idaho&quot; toured Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River in 1911, visiting many ports on the Mississippi River.

In February 1913, unrest in Mexico led to a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and the death of deposed President Francisco I. Madero. For the protection of American interests, &quot;Idaho&quot; deployed to Tampico in May and to Veracruz in June. Upon returning, she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 27 October 1913.

&quot;Idaho&quot; remained in reserve until recommissioned at Philadelphia in March 1914. In mid-year, she steamed to the Mediterranean with a group of midshipmen on board. After visiting several ports, she arrived at the French port of Villefranche on 17 July 1914. There, she was formally transferred to the Greek Navy on 30 July 1914.

===Greek service===

Diplomatic tensions between Greece and the Ottoman Empire following the 1912–13 Balkan Wars resulted in each seeking to buy powerful warships abroad that would enable them to control the Aegean Sea. &quot;Idaho&quot; and &quot;Mississippi&quot; were sold on 8 July 1914, to Fred J. Gauntlett, an intermediary, who in turn sold them to the Greek government. The proceeds of the sale were used to increase the budget for the 1915 fiscal year, funding the building of a third super-dreadnought, .

&quot;Mississippi&quot; was renamed for the crucial battle of the Second Balkan War, while &quot;Idaho&quot; became in honor of a victorious naval battle over the Turkish Navy during the First Balkan War. Though their service was uneventful, these ships served to balance German capital ships which were acquired by rival Turkey. 

The design limitations and poor seakeeping tendencies were not as critical in that strategic environment and the calmer seas of the Mediterranean. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Henry Morgenthau, Sr. wrote, &quot;Those battleships immediately took their places as the most powerful vessels of the Greek Navy, and the enthusiasm of the Greeks in obtaining them was unbounded.&quot;

====World War I====
In 1916, a serious division in the Greek government developed between King Constantine I and Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter World War I. This became known as the &quot;National Schism&quot;, where separate governments emerged.
Defections by units of the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions provoked a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from &quot;Lemnos&quot; and &quot;Kilkis&quot;. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.

In June 1917, Greece was reunified under Venizelos and declared war against the Central Powers. Restoration of the Greek Navy was slow due to British and French disagreements and the difficulty in guaranteeing the officers and crews would support a war against the Central Powers. When France returned the ships, &quot;Lemnos&quot; and &quot;Kilkis&quot; took part in Allied operations in the Aegean. The greatest Allied need in the Mediterranean was for antisubmarine units, thus battleships were not a priority.
After World War I, both ships saw action in 1919 under the command of Rear Admiral G. Kakoulidis, RHN, when the Greek Navy took part in the Allied expedition in support of Denikin&#x27;s White Armies in Ukraine.

The ships were also active in the operations of the Greco-Turkish War in Asia Minor from 1919 to 1922. As the Greeks had been on the winning side in World War I and the Ottoman Empire was one of the defeated powers, the Greeks were awarded large areas of mixed Turkish and Greek populations on the Asian coast of the Aegean Sea. On 15 May 1919, 20,000 Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies. &quot;Lemnos&quot; was the flagship to the Second Fleet, based in Smyrna, under Rear Admiral G. Kalamidas; her mission was surveillance of the Black Sea, Dardanelles, and Asia Minor coasts. Over time, France and Italy became supportive of the emerging Turkish republic. Britain remained supportive of Greece, but opposed Greek moves against Istanbul in 1922. With waning support, the Greek army was defeated, and Greece was driven out of Asia by the Turks in late 1922, resulting in years of political and economic turmoil.

Both battleships were relegated to reserve and auxiliary roles in the mid-1930s. &quot;Kilkis&quot;, which had been upgraded in the mid-1920s, became a naval artillery training facility in 1932. &quot;Lemnos&quot; guns were removed and installed in a coastal defense battery on the island of Aegina. While they were both anchored in the Salamis Naval Base on 23 April 1941, both ships were sunk during the German invasion of Greece by Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers. &quot;Kilkis&quot; was hit by bombs and went down in shallow water at her moorings; &quot;Lemnos&quot; was also hit, but was able to get underway enough to be beached. The wrecks were refloated and sold for scrap in the 1950s.

<doc id="485036" wikidata="Q1058774" url="?curid=485036" title="Northern Isles">
<text>The Northern Isles (; ; ) are a chain (or archipelago) of islands of Scotland, located off the north coast of the Scottish mainland. The climate is cool and temperate and highly influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 36 inhabited islands, with the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both archipelagos have a developing renewable energy industry. They share a common Pictish and Norse history, and were part of the Kingdom of Norway before being absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.

Tourism is important to both archipelagos, with their distinctive prehistoric ruins playing a key part in their attraction, and there are regular ferry and air connections with mainland Scotland. The Scandinavian influence remains strong, especially in local folklore and both island chains have strong, though distinct local cultures. The names of the islands are dominated by the Norse heritage, although some may retain pre-Celtic elements.

==Geography==
The phrase &quot;Northern Isles&quot; generally refers to the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos. The Island of Stroma, which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney, is part of Caithness, so for local government purposes it falls under the jurisdiction of the Highland council area, rather than that of Orkney. It is nevertheless clearly one of the &quot;northern isles&quot; of Scotland. Fair Isle and Foula are outliers of Shetland, but would normally be considered part of Shetland, and thus of the Northern Isles. Similarly, Sule Skerry and Sule Stack, although distant from the main group, are part of Orkney, and therefore technically amongst the Northern Isles. However, the other small islands that lie off the north coast of Scotland are in Highland, and are thus not usually considered to be part of the Northern Isles.

Orkney has 20 inhabited islands and Shetland has 16.

Orkney is situated north of the coast of mainland Scotland, separated from it by the waters of the Pentland Firth. The largest island of Orkney, known as the &quot;Mainland&quot; has an area of , making it the sixth largest Scottish island. Its total population in 2001 was 19,245, and its largest town is Kirkwall. Shetland is around north of mainland Scotland. It covers an area of and its coastline is long. Lerwick, the capital and largest settlement, has a population of around 7,500. About half of the archipelago&#x27;s total population of 22,000 people live within of the town.

==Geology==

The superficial rock of Orkney is almost entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series. This can be seen on the Orkney Mainland, where a narrow strip of the older rock is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and also on the small island of Graemsay.

Middle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. A correlation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed, but because of differences in their chemical makeup, this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant, and moraines cover substantial areas.

The geology of Shetland is quite different from that of Orkney. It is extremely complex, with numerous faults and fold axes. The Shetland Islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny, and there are outcrops of Lewisian, Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks whose histories are similar to those of their counterparts on the Scottish mainland. There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. Shetland&#x27;s most distinctive geological feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. There are oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas, on which much of Shetland&#x27;s economy depends.

Geological evidence shows that, sometime around 6100 BC, a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slides hit the Northern Isles (as well as much of the east coast of Scotland), and may have created a wave of up to high in the voes of Shetland, where modern populations are largest.

==Climate==

The Northern Isles have a cool, temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the surrounding seas and the Gulf Stream. In Shetland, average peak temperatures are in February and in August. Temperatures over are rare. The frost-free period may be as short as three months.

The average annual rainfall is in Orkney and in Shetland. Winds are a key feature of the climate. In summer, there are almost constant breezes. In winter, there are frequent strong winds: Orkney has an average of 52 hours of gales annually. The Burradale wind farm in Shetland, which operates with five Vestas V47 660 kW turbines, achieved a world record of 57.9% capacity over the course of 2005 due to the persistent strong winds.

Snowfall is usually confined to the period of November to February and seldom lies on the ground for more than a day. Less rain falls between April and August than at other times of the year, but no month has an average rainfall of less than . In Shetland there are 1082 hours of bright sunshine per year, on average, and overcast days are common.

To tourists, one of the fascinations of the islands is their &quot;nightless&quot; summers. On the longest day in Shetland there are over 19 hours of daylight, and it never gets completely dark. The long twilight is known in the Northern Isles as the &quot;simmer dim&quot;. Winter nights are correspondingly long, with less than six hours of daylight at midwinter. At this time of year the aurora borealis can occasionally be seen on the northern horizon during moderate auroral activity.

==Prehistory==
There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney, especially from the Neolithic period. Four of these remains comprise the Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site (designated as such in 1999). They are: Skara Brae; Maes Howe; the Stones of Stenness; and the Ring of Brodgar. The Knap of Howar Neolithic farmstead on the island of Papa Westray is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. This structure was inhabited for 900 years, beginning around 3700 BC, but it had evidently been built on the site of an even older settlement. The Shetland Islands are also extremely rich in physical remains from prehistoric eras: They contain a total of over 5,000 archaeological sites. On the island of Fetlar, there is a dividing wall, dating from the Neolithic period, that at one time extended for across the island. It is known as Funzie Girt. But it is the Iron Age that has provided the most outstanding archaeology in Shetland. Numerous brochs were erected during that period. The finest preserved example of these distinctive round towers is the Broch of Mousa. In 2011, a site known as &quot;the Crucible of Iron Age Shetland&quot;, which includes the Broch of Mousa, Old Scatness and Jarlshof, joined the UK&#x27;s &quot;Tentative List&quot; of World Heritage Sites.

==History, culture and politics==
===Pictish times===
The culture that built the brochs is unknown, but by the late Iron Age the Northern Isles had become part of the Pictish kingdom. The most common archaeological relics from that period are symbol stones. One of the best examples of these stones is on the Brough of Birsay: It depicts three warriors with spears and sword scabbards, as well as characteristic Pictish symbols. In 1958, a trove of silver metalwork, known as the St Ninian&#x27;s Isle Treasure, was discovered. The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces it contains are believed to date from around 800 AD. According to O&#x27;Dell (1959), &quot;The treasure is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period ... [T]he brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal&quot;.

Christianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century, and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. An Ogham–inscribed artefact known as the Buckquoy spindle-whorl was found at a Pictish site on Birsay. There has been controversy about its origin and meaning, but it is now generally considered to be of Irish Christian origin.

===Norse era===

The 8th century was also the time when the Vikings started invading the Scottish seaboard. They brought to the Northern Isles a new culture and a new language; rendering the fate of the existing indigenous peoples uncertain. According to the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;, Vikings then made the islands the headquarters of the pirate expeditions they carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. According to some sources, in 875, the Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre (&quot;Harald Fair Hair&quot;) annexed the Northern Isles and gifted Orkney and Shetland to Rognvald Eysteinsson as an earldom in recompense for the death of his son in battle in Scotland. (Some scholars believe this story is apocryphal and is based instead on events connected with the later voyages of Magnus III of Norway, known as Magnus Barelegs.)

In 995, King Olaf I of Norway (Olav Tryggvasson) fully Christianised the islands by fiat, when he stopped in South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The king summoned the &quot;jarl&quot; Sigurd the Stout and said, &quot;I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I&#x27;ll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel.&quot; Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed, and the islands became Christian at a stroke. In the early 11th century, they received their own bishop (the Bishop of Orkney).

===Annexation by Scotland===

In the 14th century, Orkney and Shetland remained a Norwegian province, but Scottish influence was growing. Jon Haraldsson, who was murdered in Thurso in 1231, was the last of an unbroken line of Norse jarls, and thereafter the earls were Scots noblemen of the houses of Angus and St. Clair. In 1468 Shetland was pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland. As the money was never paid, the connection with the crown of Scotland became permanent. In 1470 William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness ceded his title to James III and the following year the Northern Isles were directly annexed to Scotland.

===17th, 18th and 19th centuries===
From the early 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This trade with the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties prohibited the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.

British rule came at a price for many ordinary people as well as traders. The Shetlanders&#x27; nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 men, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters&#x27; Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners&#x27; serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms.

The Orcadian experience was somewhat different. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves &quot;comunitatis Orcadie&quot; and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords. In the 17th century, Orcadians formed the overwhelming majority of employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Canada. The harsh climate of Orkney and the Orcadian reputation for sobriety and their boat-handling skills made them ideal candidates for the rigours of the Canadian north. During this period, burning kelp briefly became a mainstay of the islands&#x27; economy. For example, on Shapinsay over of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make soda ash, bringing in £20,000 to the local economy. Agricultural improvements beginning in the 17th century coincided with the enclosure of the commons and in the Victorian era the emergence of large and well-managed farms using a five-shift rotation system and producing high-quality beef cattle. There is little evidence of an Orcadian fishing fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and then later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. Many Orcadian seamen became involved in whaling in Arctic waters during the 19th century, although the boats were generally based elsewhere in Britain.

===World Wars===

Orkney was the site of a naval base at Scapa Flow, which played a major role in World War I. After the Armistice in 1918, the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was to be made on its future; however, the German sailors opened the sea-cocks and scuttled all the ships. During World War I the 10th Cruiser Squadron was stationed at Swarbacks Minn in Shetland and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland lost more than 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.

One month into World War II, the Royal Navy battleship was sunk by a German U-boat at Scapa Flow. As a result, barriers were built to close most of the access channels; these had the advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries. The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war, who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel. The Scapa Flow base was neglected after the war, eventually closing in 1957.

During World War II, a Norwegian naval unit nicknamed the &quot;Shetland Bus&quot; was established by the Special Operations Executive in the autumn of 1940 with a base first at Lunna and later in Scalloway to conduct operations around the coast of Norway. About 30 fishing vessels used by Norwegian refugees were gathered, and the Shetland Bus conducted covert operations, carrying intelligence agents, refugees, instructors for the resistance, and military supplies. It made over 200 trips across the sea, with Leif Larsen, the most highly decorated allied naval officer of the war, making 52 of them.

The problem of a declining population was significant in the post-war years, although in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in the islands focused on growing prosperity and the emergence of a relatively classless society.

Due to their history, the islands have a Norse, rather than a Gaelic flavour, and have historic links with the Faroes, Iceland, and Norway. The similarities of both geography and history are matched by some elements of the current political process. Both Orkney and Shetland are represented in the House of Commons as constituting the Orkney and Shetland constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP), the current incumbent being Alistair Carmichael. Both are also within the Highlands and Islands electoral region for the Scottish Parliament.

In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, 65.4% of the constituency&#x27;s electors voted for Scotland to stay part of the United Kingdom.

However, there are also two separate constituencies that elect one Member of the Scottish Parliament each for Orkney and Shetland by the first past the post system. Orkney and Shetland also have separate local Councils which are both dominated by independents.

The Orkney Movement, a political party that supported devolution for Orkney from the rest of Scotland, contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement (a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland). Their candidate, John Goodlad, came 4th with 3,095 votes, 14.5% of those cast.

===Transport===

Ferry services link Orkney and Shetland to the rest of Scotland, the main routes being Scrabster harbour, Thurso to Stromness and Aberdeen to Lerwick, both operated by NorthLink Ferries. Inter-island ferry services are operated by Orkney Ferries and SIC Ferries, which are operated by the respective local authorities and Northlink also run a Lerwick to Kirkwall service. Automatic lighthouses are commonly sited across the islands as an aid to navigation at various locations.
Kirkwall Airport serves as the sole commercial airport in Orkney, which is operated by Highland and Islands Airports. Loganair provides services to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness for both Kirkwall and Sumburgh Airport.

Inter-Island flights are available from Kirkwall to several Orkney islands and from the Shetland Mainland to most of the inhabited islands including those from Tingwall Airport. There are frequent charter flights from Aberdeen to Scatsta near Sullom Voe, which are used to transport oilfield workers and this small terminal has the fifth largest number of international passengers in Scotland. The scheduled air service between Westray and Papa Westray is reputedly the shortest in the world at two minutes&#x27; duration.

===Economics===
The very different geologies of the two archipelagos have resulted in dissimilar local economies. In Shetland, the main revenue producers are agriculture, aquaculture, fishing, renewable energy, the petroleum industry (offshore crude oil and natural gas production), the creative industries and tourism. Oil and gas was first landed at Sullom Voe in 1978, and it has subsequently become one of the largest oil terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending in Shetland on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three-quarters of the islands&#x27; workforce is employed in the service sector and Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Fishing remains central to the islands&#x27; economy today, with the total catch being in 2009, valued at over £73.2 million.

Orkney and Shetland have significant wind and marine energy resources, and renewable energy has recently come into prominence. The European Marine Energy Centre is a Scottish Government–backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney Mainland and a tidal power testing station on the island of Eday. This has been described as &quot;the first of its kind in the world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility.&quot; Billia Croo also houses an experimental underwater data center run by Microsoft.

===Culture===

The Northern Isles have a rich source of folklore. There are many Orcadian tales concerning trows, a form of troll that draws on the islands&#x27; Scandinavian connections. Local customs in the past included marriage ceremonies at the Odin Stone that forms part of the Stones of Stenness.
The best known literary figures from modern Orkney are the poet Edwin Muir, the poet and novelist George Mackay Brown and the novelist Eric Linklater.

Shetland has a strong tradition of local music. The Forty Fiddlers was formed in the 1950s to promote the traditional fiddle style, which is a vibrant part of local culture today. Notable exponents of Shetland folk music include Aly Bain and the late Tom Anderson and Peerie Willie Johnson. Thomas Fraser was a country musician who never released a commercial recording during his life, but whose work has become popular more than 20 years after his untimely death in 1978.

===Language===
The Norn language, formerly spoken in the islands, is descendant of Old Norse brought by the Vikings in the 9th century. Since 1468-1469, after Orkney and Shetland were absorbed by the Kingdom of Scotland, Norn gradually began to fade as the influx of Scots-speaking settlers migrated to the islands. Norn as such became an extinct language around 1850, after the death of its last-known speaker Walter Sutherland. The local dialects of the Scots language, collectively known as Insular Scots, are distinctive and retain strong Nordic influences.

==Island names==
The etymology of the island names is dominated by Norse influence. There follows a listing of the derivation of all the inhabited islands in the Northern Isles.

===Shetland===
The oldest version of the modern name Shetland is &quot;Hetlandensis&quot; recorded in 1190 becoming &quot;Hetland&quot; in 1431 after various intermediate transformations. This then became &quot;Hjaltland&quot; in the 16th century. As Shetland&#x27;s Norn was gradually replaced by Scots &quot;Hjaltland&quot; became &quot;&quot;. When use of the letter yogh was discontinued, it was often replaced by the similar-looking letter z, hence &quot;Zetland&quot;, the mispronounced form used to describe the pre-1975 county council. However the earlier name is &quot;Innse Chat&quot; – the island of the cats (or the cat tribe) as referred to in early Irish literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the Norse name. The Cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern Scottish mainland – hence the name of Caithness via the Norse &quot;Katanes&quot; (&quot;headland of the cat&quot;), and the Gaelic name for Sutherland, &quot;Cataibh&quot;, meaning &quot;among the Cats&quot;.

The location of &quot;Thule&quot;, first mentioned by Pytheas of Massilia when he visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC is not known for certain. When Tacitus mentioned it in AD 98 it is clear he was referring to Shetland.

===Orkney===

Pytheas described Great Britain as being triangular in shape, with a northern tip called &quot;Orcas&quot;. This may have referred to Dunnet Head, from which Orkney is visible. Writing in the 1st century AD, the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela called the Orkney islands &quot;Orcades&quot;, as did Tacitus in AD 98 &quot;Orc&quot; is usually interpreted as a Pictish tribal name meaning &quot;young pig&quot; or &quot;young boar&quot;. The old Irish Gaelic name for the islands was &quot;Insi Orc&quot; (&quot;island of the pigs&quot;). The ogham script on the Buckquoy spindle-whorl is also cited as evidence for the pre-Norse existence of Old Irish in Orkney. The Pictish association with Orkney is lent weight by the Norse name for the Pentland Firth – &quot;Pettaland-fjörðr&quot; i.e &quot;Pictland Firth&quot;.

The Norse retained the earlier root but changed the meaning, providing the only definite example of an adaption of a pre-Norse place name in the Northern Isles. The islands became &quot;Orkneyar&quot; meaning &quot;seal islands&quot;. An alternative name for Orkney is recorded in 1300—Hrossey, meaning &quot;horse isle&quot; and this may also contain a Pictish element of &quot;ros&quot; meaning &quot;moor&quot; or &quot;plain&quot;.

Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands, the derivation of the name &quot;Shapinsay&quot; is not obvious. The final &#x27;ay&#x27; is from the Old Norse for &quot;island&quot;, but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be &quot;hjalpandis-øy&quot; (helpful island) due to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to &quot;Scalpandisay&quot;, which may suggest a derivation from &quot;judge&#x27;s island&quot;. Another suggestion is &quot;Hyalpandi&#x27;s island&quot;, although no one of that name is known to have been associated with Shapinsay.

===Uninhabited islands===
Stroma, from the Norse &quot;Straumøy&quot; means &quot;current island&quot;
or &quot;island in the tidal stream&quot;, a reference to the strong currents in the Pentland Firth. The Norse often gave animal names to islands, and these have been transferred into English in, for example, the Calf of Flotta and Horse of Copinsay. Brother Isle is an anglicisation of the Norse &quot;breiðareøy&quot; meaning &quot;broad beach island&quot;. The Norse &quot;holmr&quot;, meaning &quot;a small islet&quot; has become &quot;Holm&quot; in English and there are numerous examples of this use including Corn Holm, Thieves Holm and Little Holm. &quot;Muckle&quot; meaning large or big is one of few Scots words in the island names of the &quot;Nordreyar&quot; and appears in Muckle Roe and Muckle Flugga in Shetland and Muckle Green Holm and Muckle Skerry in Orkney. Many small islets and skerries have Scots or Insular Scots names such as Da Skerries o da Rokness and Da Buddle Stane in Shetland, and Kirk Rocks in Orkney.

<text>Goblin Market is an 1862 narrative poem by Christina Rossetti. It tells the story of sisters Laura and Lizzie, who are tempted with fruit by goblin merchants. In a letter to her publisher, Rossetti claimed that the poem, which is interpreted frequently as having features of remarkably sexual imagery, was not meant for children. However, in public Rossetti often stated that it &quot;was&quot; intended for children, and went on to write many children&#x27;s poems. When it appeared in her first volume of poetry, &quot;Goblin Market and Other Poems&quot;, it was illustrated by her brother, the Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

==Plot==

&quot;Goblin Market&quot; tells the adventures of two close sisters, Laura and Lizzie, with the river goblins.

Although the sisters seem to be quite young, they live by themselves in a house, and draw water every evening from a stream. As the poem begins, the sisters hear the calls of the goblin merchants selling their fantastic fruits in the twilight. On this evening, Laura, intrigued by their strangeness, lingers at the stream after her sister goes home. (Rossetti hints that the &quot;goblin men&quot; resemble animals with faces like wombats or cats, and with tails.) Longing for the goblin fruits but having no money, the impulsive Laura offers to pay a lock of her hair and &quot;a tear more rare than pearl.&quot;

Laura gorges on the delicious fruit in a sort of bacchic frenzy. Once finished, she returns home in an ecstatic trance, carrying one of the seeds. At home, Laura tells her sister of the delights she indulged in, but Lizzie is &quot;full of wise upbraidings,&quot; reminding Laura of Jeanie, another girl who partook of the goblin fruits, and then died at the beginning of winter after a long and pathetic decline. Strangely, no grass grows over Jeanie&#x27;s grave. Laura dismisses her sister&#x27;s worries, and plans to return the next night to get more fruits for herself and Lizzie. The sisters go to sleep in their shared bed.

The next day, as Laura and Lizzie go about their housework, Laura dreamily longs for the coming meeting with the goblins. That evening, however, as she listens at the stream, Laura discovers to her horror that, although her sister still hears the goblins&#x27; chants and cries, she cannot.

Unable to buy more of the forbidden fruit, Laura sickens and pines for it. As winter approaches, she withers and ages unnaturally, too weak to do her chores. One day she remembers the saved seed and plants it, but nothing grows.

Months pass, and Lizzie realises that Laura is wasting to death. Lizzie resolves to buy some of the goblin fruit for Laura. Carrying a silver penny, Lizzie goes down to the brook and is greeted warmly by the goblins, who invite her to dine. But when the merchants realise that she has no intent to eat the fruit, and only intends to pay in silver, they attack, trying to feed her their fruits by force. Lizzie is drenched with the juice and pulp, but consumes none of it.

Lizzie escapes and runs home, but when the dying Laura eats the pulp and juice from her body, the taste repulses rather than satisfies her, and she undergoes a terrifying paroxysm.

By morning, however, Laura is fully restored to health. The last stanza attests that both Laura and Lizzie live to tell their children of the evils of the goblins&#x27; fruits, and the power of a bond between sisters.

==Interpretation==
The poem has inspired disparate interpretations. James Antoniou wrote in his 2020 &quot;Canberra Times&quot; article that &quot;while the sheer lusciousness of the goblins&#x27; &#x27;sugar-baited words&#x27; undercuts the moral [of restraint and sisterly love], the strange contradictions of the story itself repel any easy allegorical readings.&quot;

Critics in the late 1970s viewed the poem as an expression of Rossetti&#x27;s feminist and homosexual politics. Some critics suggest the poem is about feminine sexuality and its relation to Victorian social mores. In addition to its clear allusions to Adam and Eve, forbidden fruit, and temptation, there is much in the poem that seems overtly sexual, such as when Lizzie, going to buy fruit from the goblins, considers her dead friend Jeanie, &quot;Who should have been a bride; / But who for joys brides hope to have / Fell sick and died&quot;, and lines like, &quot;She sucked their fruit globes fair or red&quot;; and &quot;Lizzie uttered not a word;/ Would not open lip from lip/ Lest they should cram a mouthful in;/ But laughed in heart to feel the drip/ Of juice that syruped all her face,/ And lodged in dimples of her chin,/ And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.&quot;

The poem&#x27;s attitude toward this temptation seems ambiguous, since the happy ending offers the possibility of redemption for Laura, while typical Victorian portrayals of the &quot;fallen woman&quot; ended in the fallen woman&#x27;s death. Rossetti volunteered at Highgate Penitentiary for fallen women shortly after composing &quot;Goblin Market&quot; in the spring of 1859.

Some critics believe that some feminist interpretations of the work ignore an anti-semitic aspect of the poem. The critic Cynthia Scheinberg believes the Goblins to be &quot;Hebraic&quot;, anti-semitic and anti-Judaic characters that the tested Christian sisters Laura and Lizzie must face in order to transition into wholesome and complete young women.

Other critics focus not on gender but on the Victorian consciousness of a capitalist critique of the growing Victorian economic market, whether in relation to sisters&#x27; Lizzie and Laura&#x27;s interaction with the market as gendered beings, the agricultural market, or in the rapid increase in advertising the &quot;Market&quot;. When &quot;Goblin Market&quot; was released in April 1859, most Victorians weren&#x27;t able to purchase fresh fruit, a historical note of importance when reading the poem for Victorian agriculture and tone.

According to Antony Harrison of North Carolina State University, Jerome McGann reads the poem as a criticism of Victorian marriage markets and conveys &quot;the need for an alternative social order&quot;. For Sandra Gilbert, the fruit represents Victorian women&#x27;s exclusion from the world of art. Other scholars – most notably Herbert Tucker – view the poem as a critique on the rise of advertising in pre-capitalist England, with the goblins utilising clever marketing tactics to seduce. Laura. J. Hartman, among others, has pointed out the parallels between Laura&#x27;s experience and the experience of drug addiction. Another interpretation has observed an image of Jesus Christ in Lizzie when she says: &quot;Eat me, drink me, love me.&quot; This is imagery used to identify Christ&#x27;s sacrifice in communion services.

The poem uses an irregular rhyme scheme, often using couplets or ABAB rhymes, but also repeating some rhymes many times in succession, or allowing long gaps between a word and its partner. The metre is also irregular, typically (though not always) keeping three or four stresses, in varying feet, per line. The lines below show the varied stress patterns, as well as an interior rhyme (grey/decay) picked up by the end-rhyme with &quot;away&quot;. The initial line quoted here, &quot;bright&quot;, rhymes with &quot;night&quot; a full seven lines earlier.

::But when the noon waxed bright
::Her hair grew thin and grey;
::She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
::To swift decay, and burn
::Her fire away.

== Adaptations ==
* The English composer Emanuel Abraham Aguilar, brother of the novelist Grace Aguilar, collaborated with Rossetti on a choral cantata, &quot;Goblin Market&quot;, in 1880. This was the only nineteenth century musical setting of the poem, as Rossetti granted Aguilar an exclusive. It was lightly adapted (with the author&#x27;s approval) to remove sexual and erotic connotations, making it more suitable for school performances.
* Italian composer Vittorio Ricci (1859–1925) was the first to come up with a setting once Aguilar&#x27;s exclusive rights had expired. The cantata &quot;Der Gnomen Markt&quot; was published in 1901 with an English libretto adapted by M.C. Gillington, and a German translation.
*Ruth Gipps composed the cantata &quot;Goblin Market&quot; in 1954, the first female composer to produce a setting. It is sung by two soprano soloists (solo 1 Laura, solo 2 Lizzie) and female three-part chorus, accompanied by string orchestra or piano. Her careful adaptation anticipated feminist literary interpretations of the poem that emerged in the 1970s.
*A 70-minute stage musical version of the poem adapted by Peggy Harmon and Polly Pen was performed at the Vineyard Theater in New York City in 1985.
* American composer Aaron Jay Kernis set the poem in 1995 for narrator and chamber ensemble, without alterations or abridgement, and with each syllable precisely notated. It is &quot;probably the most detailed and sustained interpretation of the poem&#x27;s irregular meter to date&quot;. It has been recorded.
* A 75-minute chamber opera &quot;Goblin Market&quot; was presented by Youth Music Theatre UK at George Square Theatre, Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005. The adaptation and libretto was by Kath Burlinson and the score by Conor Mitchell.
* New Zealand circus company The Dust Palace adapted the story into a performance piece titled &quot;The Goblin Market&quot;, incorporating various aerial and adagio circus arts. The production toured in Canada in 2016 and New Zealand in 2019.
*In July 2020, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a reading of the poem interwoven with testimony from sisters whose lives had been caught up in the cycle of addiction.

<doc id="485044" wikidata="Q881002" url="?curid=485044" title="William Hull">
<text>William Hull (June 24, 1753 – November 29, 1825) was an American military officer and politician. A veteran of the American Revolutionary War, he later served as governor of the Michigan Territory (1805–1813), where he negotiated land cessions with Native Americans through the Treaty of Detroit in 1807. Hull is most widely remembered, as the general in the first months of the War of 1812 (1812–1815), who surrendered Fort Detroit / Shelby to the British Army on August 16, 1812, following the Siege of Detroit. After the siege, he was paroled by the enemy and returned east, but court-martialed, convicted, and sentenced to death in a military court trial by the United States Army and the U.S. War Department, but later received a pardon from fourth President and military commander-in-chief James Madison (1751–1836, served 1809–1817), so his military and personal reputation somewhat recovered. He was assigned to several other commands in the next two years of the war, before the 1815 peace Treaty of Ghent and return to the pre-war status quo with the British. 

==Early life and education==
William Hull was born on June 24, 1753, in Derby, Connecticut, then part of the Connecticut Colony. He graduated from Yale College (now Yale University) in 1772 and initially studied religion at his parents&#x27; behest. However, he soon shifted his focus to law, studying in Litchfield, Connecticut, and gaining admission to the bar in 1775.

Hull&#x27;s legal career was interrupted by the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. He joined the local militia (likely the Connecticut Line), quickly rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel due to his leadership skills.

==Career==
===American Revolutionary War (1775-1783)===
At the outbreak of fighting in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Hull joined a local militia and was quickly promoted to captain, then through the ranks to lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army. He fought in the following battles of the Revolutionary War: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Stillwater, Saratoga, Fort Stanwix, Monmouth, and Stony Point. He was recognized by commanding General George Washington (1732–1799), of the Continental Army and also by the Second Continental Congress meeting at Independence Hall in the temporary capital city of Philadelphia for his service.

Hull was a friend of the famous patriot Nathan Hale and tried to dissuade him from the dangerous spy mission that ultimately cost him his life at the young age of 21, when he was caught and hung by the British (as spying was considered a violation of the laws of war). Hull was largely responsible for making known and publicizing the famous last words attributed to Hale, &quot;I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country.&quot;, one of the most famous historical quotes in American history.

At the conclusion of the war, Hull was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Massachusetts when it was established at the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783.

After the war, he moved to his wife&#x27;s family estate in Newton, Massachusetts and served as a judge and served in the upper chamber of the General Court of Massachusetts (state legislature) of the Massachusetts Senate as a state senator. Six years after the war, he was elected captain of the veterans organization Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts in 1789.

=== Michigan Territory Governor (1805-1813) and War of 1812 (1812-1815) ===

On March 22, 1805, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Hull as Governor of the recently created Michigan Territory and as its Indian Agent. All of the territory was in the hands of the Indians except for two enclaves around Detroit and Fort Mackinac, so Hull worked to gradually purchase Indian land for occupation by American settlers. He negotiated the Treaty of Detroit in 1807 with the Odawa, Chippewa, Wyandot, and Potawatomi tribes, which ceded most of Southeast Michigan and northwestern Ohio to the United States, to the mouth of the Maumee River where Toledo developed. These efforts to expand American settlement began to generate opposition, particularly from Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa, who urged resistance to American culture and to further land cessions.

By February 1812, Congress was making plans for war with Great Britain, including an invasion of Canada, while the British were busy recruiting Indian tribes in the Michigan and Canada area. Hull was in Washington, D.C., when 6th U.S. Secretary of War William Eustis (1753–1825, served 1809–1813), informed him that President James Madison wished to appoint him a Brigadier General in command of the newly organized Army of the Northwest. Hull at this point, was nearly 60 years old and had little interest in a new military command, so Colonel Jacob Kingsbury was selected to lead the force instead. Kingsbury however, fell ill before taking command, and the offer was repeated to Hull, who then accepted. His orders were to go to Ohio, whose Governor had been charged by President Madison with raising a 1,200-man militia United of Ohio men that would be augmented by the regular Army United of the 4th Infantry Regiment from duty at Vincennes in the Indiana Territory, to form the core of the Northwest Army. From there, he was to march the army to Fort Detroit where he was also to continue managing the surrounding region, of the Michigan Territory as territorial governor south and west of the Great Lakes and along the poorly undefended northern international border with British Canada.
==== March to Detroit (1812)====
Hull arrived in Cincinnati on May 10, 1812, and took command of the militia at Dayton on May 25. The militia comprised three regiments who elected Duncan McArthur, Lewis Cass, and James Findlay as their commanding Colonels. They marched to Staunton and then to Urbana, Ohio, where they were joined by the 300-man 4th Infantry Regiment. The men of the militia were ill-equipped and little trained, averse to strong military discipline. Hull relied on the regulars to maintain discipline among the militia during the march.On June 15, 1812, Hull&#x27;s force of over 2,000 men departed Urbana for Detroit. Rain and difficult terrain slowed their progress, and they did not reach the rapids of the Maumee River until June 29.

Unbeknownst to Hull, the United States United States Congress declared war on the United Kingdom on June 18, 1812, and that same day Secretary Eustis sent two letters to commanding General Hull. He sent one of them by special messenger which arrived on June 24—but it did not mention the declaration of war. The second one did announce the declaration of war, but Eustis sent it via the postal service and it did not arrive until July 2. As a result, Hull was still unaware that his army was at war when he reached the rapids of the Maumee. In the meantime, while camped at the Maumee Rapids, taking advantage of the waterway, he sent the schooner &quot;Cuyahoga Packet&quot; ahead of the army to Detroit with a number of invalids, supplies, and official documents; but the British commander at Fort Amherstburg had received the declaration of war two days earlier, and he captured the ship as it sailed past. Thus, he gained all of Hull&#x27;s military papers and plans for an attack on Fort Amherstburg.

==== Invasion of Canada (1812) ====

Hull was partly the victim of his government&#x27;s poor preparation for war and poor communication. He had repeatedly urged his superiors while he was governor to build a naval fleet on Lake Erie in order to defend Detroit, Fort Mackinac, and Fort Dearborn, but his requests were ignored by General Henry Dearborn, the commander of the northeast.

Hull began an invasion of Canada on July 12, 1812, crossing the Detroit River east of Sandwich (the area around Windsor, Ontario). He issued a proclamation to the &quot;inhabitants of Canada&quot; indicating that he wanted to free them from the &quot;tyranny&quot; of Great Britain and to give them the liberty, security, and wealth which his own country was experiencing—unless they preferred &quot;war, slavery and destruction&quot;. It soon became apparent that he would encounter great resistance, however, and he withdrew to the American side of the river on August 7 after receiving news of a Shawnee ambush on Major Thomas Van Horne&#x27;s 200 men who had been sent to support the American supply convoy; half of the troops were killed. Hull had also faced a lack of support from his officers and fear among the troops of a possible massacre by Indian forces. A group of 600 troops led by Lieutenant Colonel James Miller remained in Canada, attempting to supply the American position in the Sandwich area, with little success.

==== Surrender of Detroit (1812)====
Hull surrendered Fort Detroit to General Isaac Brock on August 16, 1812, because Brock had tricked him into thinking that he was vastly outnumbered by his foes. The force included 600 Indian warriors and 1,300 soldiers, as well as two warships, according to Brock&#x27;s report. Hull had 2,500 soldiers under his command. The number of troops under Hull&#x27;s command was estimated at between 750 and 1060 by his grandson.

Brock sent Hull a demand for surrender:
The force at my disposal authorizes me to require of you the immediate surrender of Fort Detroit. It is far from my intention to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware, that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops, will be beyond control the moment the contest commences.

Hull believed that the surrender was a valid step because he was lacking adequate gunpowder and cannonballs to withstand a long siege. The move also saved his 2,500 soldiers and 700 civilians from &quot;the horrors of an Indian massacre&quot;, as he later wrote.

In 1814, Hull was court martialed at a trial presided over by General Henry Dearborn, with future president Martin Van Buren as the special judge advocate in charge of the prosecution. Robert Lucas, the future governor of Ohio and territorial governor of Iowa, gave evidence against him. Hull was convicted of cowardice and neglect of duty and was sentenced to be shot. However, President James Madison commuted the sentence to merely dismissing him from the Army in recognition of his heroic service during the Revolutionary War.

==Later life and death==
Hull lived the remainder of his life in Newton, Massachusetts with his wife Sarah Fuller. He wrote &quot;Detroit: Defence of Brig. Gen. Wm. Hull in 1814&quot; and &quot;Memoirs of the Campaign of the Northwestern Army of the United States: A.D. 1812&quot;, published in 1824 and both attempting to clear his name. Some later historians have agreed that he was unfairly made a scapegoat for the embarrassing loss of Detroit. The publication of his &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1824 changed public opinion somewhat in his favor, and he was honored with a dinner in Boston on May 30, 1825. That June, the Marquis de Lafayette visited him and declared, &quot;We both have suffered contumely and reproach; but our characters are vindicated; let us forgive our enemies and die in Christian love and peace with all mankind.&quot; Hull died at home in Newton several months later, on November 29, 1825.

His son Abraham was an Army captain during the War of 1812 and died at the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane at age 27. His remains were buried in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls, Ontario, the only American officer to be buried there. Hull was also uncle to Isaac Hull, son of his brother Joseph. Joseph died while Isaac was young, so Hull adopted the boy. Isaac commanded the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; during the War of 1812.

<text>Baron Forester, of Willey Park in the County of Shropshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 17 July 1821 for Cecil Weld-Forester, who had previously represented Wenlock in the House of Commons. Born Cecil Forester, he assumed the additional surname of Weld by royal licence in 1811. His son, the second Baron, also represented Wenlock from 1790 in Parliament, and later served in the Tory administration of Sir Robert Peel as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords) from 1841 to 1846.

He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Wenlock for 46 years, and was Father of the House from 1873 to 1874. His nephew, the fifth baron, also represented Wenlock in Parliament as a Conservative. Both his son, the sixth baron, and grandson, the seventh baron, served as mayor of Wenlock. , the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the ninth baron, who succeeded his father in 2004.

The family were anciently hereditary foresters of Wellington Hay in Mount Gilbert Forest, and lived at Wellington or at Watling Street Hall (later Old hall), where they had a half virgate of land held by keeping the Hay. John Forester (died c. 1521) leased Wellington Hay from perhaps 1512, and another John Forester bought its freehold in 1555. The family became gentry and several of the family became Members of Parliament for Wenlock. Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, was a great-great-granddaughter of the 1st Baron Forester.

The family seat since 1811 is Willey Hall, near Willey, Shropshire. The estate was inherited by Brooke Forester through his wife, Elizabeth Weld, and has remained in the Weld-Forester family for over two centuries.

<text>The North Isles are the northern islands of the Shetland Islands, Scotland. The main islands in the group are Yell, Unst and Fetlar. Sometimes the islands in Yell Sound are included in this group.

== Importance ==
They are a significant group, since Yell and Unst are the second and third largest islands in the archipelago, and also the third and fourth most populous (Whalsay, which is not in the group, is the second most populous). Combined, their total land area is far larger than the rest of the Shetland Islands (excluding Mainland) combined.

== Extreme points ==
The group also contains the most northerly land of the United Kingdom and Shetland at Out Stack near Muckle Flugga, and its most northerly settlement Skaw on Unst. These also happen to be the most northerly British territorial claims currently in existence, since Canadian independence. In similar fashion, Britain&#x27;s most northerly maritime claims are also based on these islands, having great effect on its fishing and oil industries.

Fetlar also contains some of the most easterly points of Scotland with the exception of the Out Skerries, and much of Fetlar and Unst are under 350 km from Norway.

Travellers do not encounter any further land masses between Out Stack and the North Pole if heading directly north.

Other British records include -
* Most northerly castle Muness Castle
* Most northerly post office - formerly Haroldswick now Baltasound
* Most northerly lighthouse - Muckle Flugga
* Most northerly road
* Most northerly brewery - Valhalla Brewery
* Most northerly coastline - Hermanness
* Most northerly church - Haroldswick Methodist Church 
* Most northerly ferry route - Gutcher (Yell) to Belmont (Unst)
* Most northerly &quot;wood&quot; - near Baltasound

== Ferries ==
The regular ferries are the most northerly scheduled routes in the British Isles (excluding those going to the Faroes and Iceland). They operate between Yell and Unst, Yell and Fetlar and Yell and Mainland.

<text>Modo Hockey (or MoDo with uppercase letters) is a professional ice hockey club in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The team currently plays in Sweden&#x27;s first-tier league SHL after having won promotion from HockeyAllsvenskan following the 2022/23 season. The club was founded in 1987 and has won one title, the SHL championships, in 2007. The team&#x27;s home arena since 2006 is the Hägglunds Arena (previously known as &quot;Fjällräven Center&quot; and &quot;Swedbank Arena&quot;). Before then, the team played at Kempehallen, beginning in 1964.

==History==

===Alfredshems IK and Modo AIK (1921–87)===
The club was founded on 27 March 1921 as Alfredshems IK, however it existed without an ice hockey program until 1938. Twenty years later, in 1958, the club joined Hockeyallsvenskan, Sweden&#x27;s highest division at the time. Alfredshems IK played under that name until 1963, when it was renamed Modo AIK after their main sponsor, industrial corporation Mo och Domsjö AB (commonly abbreviated MoDo). The following year, the club made the newly constructed Kempehallen their home arena. In 1975, Modo AIK joined the Elitserien as one of the premier league&#x27;s original ten teams. Four seasons later, Modo AIK won their first regular-season championship in 1979, en route to defeating previous ten-time champion Djurgårdens IF to also capture their first Le Mat trophy as playoff champions.
===MoDo Hockey (1987–present)===
In 1987, Modo AIK dropped the &quot;AIK&quot; suffix to the club&#x27;s name, becoming known simply as Modo Hockey. After coming off its championship year in 1979, the club spent the majority of the 1980s with losing records. Coming out of the club&#x27;s junior program, however, hometown stars Peter Forsberg and Markus Näslund played their rookie seasons with the senior team in 1990–91. Näslund went on to lead Modo Hockey in scoring as an eighteen-year-old in his second season with the club, while Forsberg became the first Modo player to win the Guldpucken as Swedish player of the year since Nils Johansson in 1964, capturing the title back-to-back in 1993 and 1994.

With both Forsberg and Näslund having been chosen as first-round selections in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, however, their time in Sweden was limited. Näslund departed for the NHL in 1993, while Forsberg remained to lead Modo to their second Elitserien playoff final in 1994, where they lost to Malmö IF. Soon after Forsberg&#x27;s inevitable departure to the NHL in 1995, identical twin brothers Daniel and Henrik Sedin represented the next wave of young talent coming through the Modo system. At seventeen-years-old, they captured the Guldpucken together as co-recipients in 1999, while leading Modo to a 33-win season (in a 50-game schedule) for the club&#x27;s second regular-season title. As second- and third-overall selections in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, respectively, Daniel and Henrik left Modo for the NHL in 2000. Regardless, Modo became consistent contenders for the Le Mat trophy, appearing in three out of four playoff finals – losing all three – between 1999 and 2002.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, many former Modo stars returned to the team from the NHL, including Forsberg, Näslund, the Sedins and František Kaberle. Several foreign NHL players also signed with Modo, including Canadian defenceman Adrian Aucoin and American forward Dan Hinote. Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo (a product of VIK Västerås HK) joined as the starting goaltender. Despite a bolstered lineup, Modo finished sixth in the regular season.

Having played in Kempehallen as their home arena since 1964, Modo moved into the then newly constructed Swedbank Arena, which was partially funded by former star Forsberg and his father Kent, who was also a former club head coach. Modo returned to Elitserien supremacy that season, defeating Linköpings HC on April 14, 2007, to capture their second Le Mat trophy in franchise history. The championship-winning club featured the 2007 Guldpucken-recipient Per Svartvadet, team leading-scorer Per-Åge Skrøder and future NHL defenceman Tobias Enström. The return of Niklas Sundström, who had originally played with the club alongside Forsberg and Näslund in the early 1990s, bolstered Modo&#x27;s roster as he finished second in team scoring in his first season back from the NHL. An approximate 8,000 fans were in attendance at the Swedbank Arena for Modo&#x27;s first championship in 28 years.

In the 2008–09 season the team finished ninth in Elitserien, thus missing the playoffs. In the 2009–10 season, Forsberg returned to play for Modo on a conditioning-basis to prepare for an anticipated return to the NHL after having been inactive for a season due to injury. With Näslund back in Sweden, having retired after the 2008–09 NHL season, he correctly predicted that Forsberg would not return to the NHL and finish the season with Modo instead. Several days later, on November 17, 2009, Näslund announced he was coming out of retirement to also rejoin Modo with Forsberg. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund also announced he would play without a salary, along with Forsberg. Despite Näslund&#x27;s and Forsberg&#x27;s return to Modo, the team finished ninth and thus missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. After the 2009–10 season, Näslund retired again, and Forsberg left Modo again. After Näslund&#x27;s second retirement, he was named the general manager of Modo.

In the 2010–11 season the team were closer to relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan than since 1990. The team finished last in Elitserien after a very tight battle in the bottom of Elitserien and thus were forced to play in Kvalserien for the first time since 1990 (the team survived the 1990 Kvalserien). After the 2011 Kvalserien&#x27;s ninth round, Modo and Södertälje both had 17 points. Modo and Södertälje met each other in Fjällräven Center in the final round, for a game that directly decided which team would be relegated to HockeyAllsvenskan. Modo won the game 2–0 and thus stayed in Elitserien for the 2011–12 season. Nearly two weeks later, Peter Forsberg was named an assistant general manager of the Modo organization. Just a day later, on April 21, 2011, Modo Hockey&#x27;s then head coach Charles &quot;Challe&quot; Berglund was forced to leave the club.

On May 2, 2011, Ulf Samuelsson, who had been an assistant coach in the National Hockey League (NHL), was named the head coach of Modo Hockey, a position he held for two seasons. 

==Women&#x27;s team==

During the 2012–13 Riksserien season, Modo finished first in the regular season, but were eliminated in the semifinals by Brynäs IF.

==NHL alumni==
Although Örnsköldsvik is a small town with an approximate population of just 29,000, the city has produced numerous born-and-raised NHL talents through the Modo system. The hockey-centred town has six indoor rinks, with the Hägglunds Arena boasting regular attendances of 7,000 for Modo home games, marking nearly a quarter of the population.

Anders Hedberg was one of the first Swedes to succeed in the NHL, in the 1970s. In the early 1990s, forwards Peter Forsberg and Markus Näslund emerged from Modo&#x27;s junior system and were drafted 6th and 16th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins, respectively in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. They became arguably Modo&#x27;s first NHL stars. Forsberg went on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year in 1995 with the Nordiques and the Hart Memorial Trophy as NHL MVP with the Colorado Avalanche in 2003, while Näslund won the Lester B. Pearson Award as NHL MVP chosen by the players in 2003. Furthermore, Forsberg and Näslund finished first and second in league point-scoring for the Art Ross Trophy in 2003. Besides the two league-leaders, the 2002–03 season featured 13 NHL players originating from Modo, as well as seven others who were born and raised within a couple miles of Örnsköldsvik. Forward Niklas Sundström also played alongside Forsberg and Näslund with Modo and was drafted 8th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers.

Eight years after Forsberg and Näslund&#x27;s draft selections, identical twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin were drafted second and third overall, joining Näslund in Vancouver. In 2005–06, Näslund, Henrik and Daniel finished first, second and third, respectively, in Canucks team-scoring. In fact, from the 1998–99 season until the 2016-17 season, no Canucks player has led the team in scoring besides either Näslund, Henrik or Daniel. During the 2009–10 season, Henrik became the second former Modo player to win the NHL&#x27;s Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer and the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP. The next year fellow Canuck and twin brother Daniel Sedin would go on to win the Art ross trophy making it the first time in NHL history that two brothers won scoring titles consecutively.

In 2008–09 defenceman Victor Hedman began drawing considerable attention from the NHL and was eventually selected second overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, matching Daniel Sedin as the highest-drafted Modo player in team history.

Victor Olofsson found success with the Buffalo Sabres upon joining the team in 2019, becoming a permanent member of the team in the 2019–20 season.

<doc id="485058" wikidata="Q2622924" url="?curid=485058" title="Polivanov system">
<text>Polivanov system is a system of transliterating the Japanese language into Russian Cyrillic script, either to represent Japanese proper names or terms in Russian or as an aid to Japanese language learning in The system was developed by Yevgeny Polivanov in 1917.

In terms of spelling the system is a middle ground between Kunrei-shiki and Hepburn romanisations, matching the former everywhere except for morae &quot;hu&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;, which are spelled as in Hepburn (&quot;fu&quot; and &quot;tsu&quot;), moras starting with z (which are spelled with dz, as in archaic Hepburn, but following the consistency of Kunrei-shiki with Jun being spelled as Dzyun) and syllabic n, which is changed to &quot;m&quot; before b, p and m as in traditional Hepburn.

The following cyrillization system for Japanese is known as the Yevgeny Polivanov system. Note that it has its own spelling conventions and does not necessarily constitute a direct phonetic transcription of the pronunciation into the standard Russian usage of the Cyrillic alphabet.

==Main table==
Hiragana and Katakana to Polivanov cyrillization correspondence table, for single/modified kana.




Syllabic n (ん/ン) is spelled м (m) before b, p, m, and spelled нъ before vowels.

Grammar particles は and へ are written ва and э. Syllable を is written either во or о depending on pronunciation (albeit &quot;о&quot; is more preferred).

==Diphthongs==
It is permitted to use й instead of и in diphthongs (e.g. &quot;shinjitai → синдзитай&quot;, &quot;seinen → сэйнэн&quot;). However, &quot;и&quot; is always used on a morpheme clash: &quot;Kawai (kawa + i) → Каваи&quot;.

Yevgeny Polivanov recommended (but not prescribed as mandatory) to use &quot;й&quot; for Sino-Japanese (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;) words, and &quot;и&quot; for native Japanese (&quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;) words. Another Polinanov&#x27;s recommendation is to spell the diphthong &quot;ei&quot; as a long vowel &quot;э:&quot;, but this recommendation is almost never followed in practice. Instead, long vowel &quot;ē&quot; in the name ending &quot;-bē&quot; is often transliterated as &quot;-эй&quot;, e.g. &quot;Gonbē → Гомбэй.&quot;

==Geminate consonants==
Consonants are geminated exactly as they are in romaji: e.g. &quot;-kk-&quot; &gt; -кк-.

==Long vowels==
Long vowels may be marked by macron as in Hepburn, but since letter ё has a diacritical mark already it is permitted and much more common to mark long vowels by using a colon (e.g. сё:гун). The sequence &quot;ei&quot; may be written э:, эй or эи. In regular texts long vowels are usually unmarked.

== Vowel omission ==
Normally, vowels in the Polivanov system are always spelled, even if they are not pronounced. However, the voiceless &quot;u&quot; in the name ending &quot;-suke&quot; may be omitted:

&quot;Ryūnosuke → Рюноскэ.&quot;

Some translators tend to omit voiceless &quot;u&quot; in all cases when &quot;su&quot; (and, less often, &quot;tsu&quot;) is followed by a &quot;k-&quot;syllable, e.g. &quot;Akatsuki&quot; → &quot;Акацки&quot;, &quot;Daisuki&quot; → &quot;Дайски&quot;. However, this omission is considered non-standard.

Another non-standard (if not controversial) practice is omitting the voiceless &quot;u&quot; at the end of words, mostly in &quot;desu → дэс&quot; and &quot;masu → мас&quot;. This spelling can be found in some learning materials, but most professional translators oppose it, because native speakers may pronounce &quot;su&quot; at the end of the word with a distinctive &quot;u&quot; sound (especially in &quot;feminine&quot; speech).

==Common mistakes and deviations==
In English texts, Japanese names are written with the Hepburn system. Attempts may be made to transcribe these as if they were English, rather than following a dedicated Japanese Cyrillization scheme.

A common example of this is attempting to transcribe &quot;shi&quot; (Polivanov: си) as ши and &quot;ji&quot; (Polivanov: дзи) as джи. This is inadvisable for use in Russian, because ши is actually pronounced like шы in Russian, and джи like джы, thus making the vowel () closer to Japanese than to Japanese . Whereas, щи would have a correct vowel sound, but be pronounced more like Japanese .

Equally often, people transcribe &quot;cha&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;chu&quot;, &quot;cho&quot; as ча, чи, чу, чо. This is phonetically correct, but does not conform with the Polivanov scheme (тя, ти, тю, тё), which more closely resembles the Kunrei-shiki romanisations (&quot;tya&quot;, &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;tyu&quot;, &quot;tyo&quot;) for these particular characters.

Sometimes е, rather than э, is used for &quot;e&quot;, despite е being pronounced &quot;ye&quot; in Russian (though not in other languages). This is typically not done in the initial position, despite older romanisations such as &quot;Yedo&quot; doing so. In any case, it does not conform with the Polivanov scheme, although it is seen as more acceptable for words that are in general use (e.g. &quot;kamikaze&quot; &gt; камикадзе instead of камикадзэ). Replacing ё (&quot;yo&quot;) with е (&quot;ye&quot;) is incorrect, however, as it will change the Japanese word too much.

The sound &quot;yo&quot; (Polivanov: ё), when in the initial position or after a vowel, is often written as йо (yo), which has the same pronunciation: Ёкосука -&gt; Йокосука (Yokosuka), Тоёта -&gt; Тойота (Toyota). Although, the spelling &quot;йо&quot; is not common in Russian words, these are more generally accepted for Japanese names than the transliterations using &quot;ё&quot;. &quot;Ё&quot; is not often used in Japanese Cyrillization due to its facultative use in the Russian language (and possible substitution with the letter &quot;Е&quot; which would affect the pronunciation), but for professional translators, the use of ё is mandatory. Some personal names beginning with &quot;Yo&quot; (or used after a vowel) are written using &quot;Ё&quot; (e.g. Йоко for Yoko Ono, but Ёко for Yoko Kanno and all other Yokos).

== Exceptions ==
Some proper names, for historical reasons, do not follow the above rules. For example, the geographical names of Japan in Russian are transmitted according to special instructions for the transfer of geographical names (other language names, for example from the Ainu language, do not fall under the Polivanov system). Other Japanese names and concepts were adapted into Russian from other languages (for example, under the influence of Hepburn or other transliteration systems). Those include but are not limited to:

<text>Baron Feversham is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Great Britain and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation, in the Peerage of Great Britain, came in 1747 when Anthony Duncombe, who had earlier represented Salisbury and Downton in the House of Commons, was made Lord Feversham, Baron of Downton, in the County of Wilts. He had previously inherited half of the enormous fortune of his uncle Sir Charles Duncombe. However, Lord Feversham had no sons and the barony became extinct on his death in 1763. The peerage was revived in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1826 in favour of his kinsman Charles Duncombe, who was created Baron Feversham, of Duncombe Park in the County of York. He was a former Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury, Aldborough, Heytesbury and Newport. Duncombe was the grandson of Thomas Duncombe, son of John Brown (who assumed the surname Duncombe) by his wife Ursula Duncombe, aunt of the first Baron of the 1747 creation. Ursula had inherited the other half of her brother Sir Charles Duncombe&#x27;s fortune. Lord Feversham son, the second Baron, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Yorkshire and the North Riding of Yorkshire.

He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. He represented East Retford and the North Riding of Yorkshire in the House of Commons as a Conservative. On 25 July 1868 he was created Viscount Helmsley, of Helmsley in the North Riding of the County of York, and Earl of Feversham, of Ryedale in the North Riding of the County of York. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl, who sat in Parliament as a Conservative representative for Thirsk and Malton. He was killed in the First World War, when the titles were inherited by his son, the third Earl. He notably served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1934 to 1936 in the National Government. On his death in 1963 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of Feversham by his distant relative (his fourth cousin), the sixth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of Admiral the Honourable Arthur Duncombe, fourth son of the first Baron. the title is held by his eldest son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2009.

Several other members of the Duncombe family have also gained distinction. Anthony Duncombe, father of the first Baron of the 1747 creation, was Member of Parliament for Hedon. The aforementioned Sir Charles Duncombe, uncle of the first Baron of the 1747 creation, was a wealthy banker. Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, nephew of the first Baron of the 1826 creation, was a Radical politician. The aforementioned Admiral Arthur Duncombe, fourth son of the first Baron, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and Member of Parliament. He was the father of 1) Arthur Duncombe, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and 2) George Augustus Duncombe, who was created a baronet in 1919 (see Duncombe baronets). The Very Reverend Augustus Duncombe (1814–1880), younger son of the first Baron, was Dean of York. The Honourable Octavius Duncombe, younger son of the first Baron, represented the North Riding of Yorkshire in Parliament.

The ancestral seat of the Duncombe family is Duncombe Park near Helmsley, Yorkshire.

<text>The Opéra Bastille (, &quot;Bastille Opera House&quot;) is a modern opera house in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, France. Inaugurated in 1989 as part of President François Mitterrand&#x27;s &quot;Grands Travaux&quot;, it became the main facility of the Paris National Opera, France&#x27;s principal opera company, alongside the older Palais Garnier; most opera performances are shown at the Bastille along with some ballet performances and symphony concerts, while Palais Garnier presents a mix of opera and ballet performances.

Designed by Uruguayan-Canadian architect Carlos Ott, it is situated facing Place de la Bastille. It may seat 2,723 people in total, with a main theatre, concert hall and studio theatre, making it the largest opera house in Europe.

== History ==

=== Background and construction ===

The idea of a new &quot;popular and modern&quot; opera house in Paris first arose in the 1880s, only years after the opening of the Palais Garnier. It would remain virtual for a century and reemerge periodically due to the recurrent &quot;crisis at the Opera&quot; and to the limitations imposed on modern opera production by the palais Garnier. It was notably promoted in 1965–1968 by stage director Jean Vilar, the most prominent figure in &quot;popular theatre&quot; at the time, who had been commissioned a reform project for the National Opera Theatre and echoed composer Pierre Boulez’ provocative appeal to &quot;blow up opera houses&quot;, as well as by senior civil servant François Bloch-Lainé in a 1977 report on the Opera&#x27;s management and perspectives.

In 1981, the newly elected President François Mitterrand included a new opera house in his large monument-building programme known as the &quot;&quot;Grands Travaux&quot;&quot;. The project was originally part of the Cité de la musique, a complex of musical institutions in North-Eastern Paris. It was quickly decided to separate it and to build it in the Bastille area of Paris, a relatively working-class district that also evoked the French Revolution and was a traditional starting or ending point for demonstrations. The following year, an international competition was launched, under supervision of the Opéra Bastille Public Corporation (EPOB), to select an architect. 756 entries were received, and, in November 1983, the competition was won by little-known architect Carlos Ott, an Uruguayan living in Canada. It was said that the jury, who—as it is common with architectural competitions—did not know the names or track-records of the entrants, mistakenly assumed the design was by the distinguished American architect Richard Meier.

Construction began in 1984 with the demolition of the &quot;gare de la Bastille&quot; train station, which had opened in 1859 and closed in 1969, and where art expositions had been held thereafter. In 1986, the new right-wing government led by Jacques Chirac considered canceling the project, but eventually decided it was too advanced and gave it the green light again. President Mitterrand remained personally involved throughout the building process, to the point that the planning team referred to him to decide on the seats’ colour following internal disagreement. (He chose black.)

In the original project, the house also included a small concert hall and a multi-purpose hall (&quot;salle modulable&quot;). The latter was a public request by Pierre Boulez, who had long been publicly lamenting the lack of a proper venue for contemporary music and experimental performances in Paris. However, due to the construction delays, it was eventually shelved, much to Boulez’ irritation, and a similar facility was eventually built as part of the Cité de la musique. The concert hall, known as the Bastille Amphitheatre (&quot;amphithéâtre Bastille&quot;), was maintained and built.

After massive budget overruns, the final construction cost was at 2.8 billion French francs.

The building was inaugurated by François Mitterrand on 13 July 1989, on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, in the presence of thirty-three foreign heads of state or heads of government. A semi-staged gala concert, directed by Robert Wilson under the title &quot;la Nuit avant le jour&quot; (&quot;The Night Before the Day&quot;), was conducted by Georges Prêtre and featured singers such as Teresa Berganza and Plácido Domingo. The Paris Opera&#x27;s traditional Bastille Day free concert was given there the following day.

The opera house was unfinished at the time of the official inauguration, and did not see its first opera performance until 17 March 1990, with Hector Berlioz’ &quot;les Troyens&quot;, directed by Pier Luigi Pizzi.

=== Troubles and controversies ===

The Opéra Bastille&#x27;s management and reputation were marred by a number of controversies and scandals in the house&#x27;s first decade, from before its opening.

In 1987, conductor Daniel Barenboim, who had previously led the orchestre de Paris, was hired to become the house&#x27;s first Artistic Director, and began planning the first seasons. In January 1989, six months before inauguration, the company&#x27;s board chairman Pierre Bergé, otherwise head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house, fired Barenboim, reportedly after the conductor&#x27;s refusal to cut his pay by half as well as due to his modernist stance, which Bergé deemed unfit for a &quot;popular&quot; opera house. It was also noted that Barenboim had been hired by a right-wing government, while Bergé was a prominent supporter and donor of the Socialist Party. This decision proved extremely controversial in the artistic field: Patrice Chéreau backed off the staging of the inaugural gala, composer Pierre Boulez resigned from the Board of Directors, and Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti, along with several other prominent conductors, signed a letter of protest and called for a boycott of the opéra Bastille, canceling their own concerts there. This made the search for a new artistic director difficult; in May, Bergé was finally able to announce the appointment of Korean pianist and conductor Myung-whun Chung, then young and practically unknown in France. Chung took the pit for the first opera performance in May 1990.

Although his term was later extended to last until 2000, Chung was fired in 1994 after the right-wing coalition&#x27;s election victory, the end of Pierre Bergé&#x27;s board tenure and a power play with the company&#x27;s Director designate, Hugues Gall, who cancelled his contract; at the height of the conflict, Chung was physically prevented from entering the building despite a judicial ruling in his favour.

The building was as much a source of trouble as the leadership conflicts. As early as 1991, a few of the 36,000 Burgundy limestone panels covering the facade began to fall, which led to the installation of safety nets over some external walls in 1996; they were dubbed &quot;condoms with holes&quot; by the disgruntled Director. Several major alterations had to be carried out in the following years, including that of the soundproofing structure and adjusting the orchestra pit&#x27;s acoustics; each change proved complex and sometimes involved court proceedings to determine who was responsible. The facade problems were not solved until 2009 with the installation of new tiles made of composite material and attached differently. However, many nets are still in place on facades in 2022.

=== Operations ===
The Opéra Bastille was originally expected to become the company&#x27;s sole opera venue, with the Palais Garnier turned into a dedicated ballet venue. However, this strict division was abandoned in the 1990s when some operas were performed at the Palais Garnier and the company&#x27;s ballet also danced at the Bastille. Since then, most opera performances take place at the modern house with some ballet performances and a few symphony concerts every season, while the traditional house presents a mix of opera and ballet performances.

Hugues Gall, who took over as the Paris National Opera&#x27;s Director in 1995, was originally an opponent of the Bastille project, famously quipping that the new opera house was &quot;the wrong answer to a problem that did not exist&quot;. In his nine-year term, he is however credited with stabilising the company&#x27;s administrative, artistic and financial situation, partly due to the possibilities offered by the modern theatre: higher revenues due to the larger seating capacity, wider range of technical means for stage directors, better working environment, higher scheduling flexibility.

== Design ==

The Opéra Bastille is located on the place de la Bastille. In order to make it &quot;blend into&quot; the landscape, the square was not remodelled to be aligned with it in a general parallel plan, but the left-hand side of the facade was left partly hidden behind an older and smaller building, which was expected to give the impression that the opera house had been part of the area for a very long time. The building then elongates itself behind the facade following a generally triangular shape, hidden by other buildings around. The theatre is &quot;surmounted by the opaque cube of the stage building and wrapped in gridded walls of glass… the Opera stands sociably open to the world outside, whereas the foyers, with their broad overview of the city, have the slick, impersonal look of an airport lounge.&quot; These foyers run around the theatre&#x27;s auditorium on several levels and give the external glass facade its round shape.

Access to the entrance hall is directly from the square at street level. Although a monumental external staircase leading to the first-level foyer and a direct underground access from the Bastille subway station to the entrance hall were built, they were eventually closed.

The theatre&#x27;s auditorium was designed with 2,723 seats, later reduced to 2,703. It is organised in an arena format with two huge balconies at the back, with a few narrow balconies on the sides. It was a conscious, egalitarian, departure from the Palais Garnier, which has several dozen types of seats and does not offer stage visibility from all of them. Every seat at the Opéra Bastille offers an unrestricted view of the stage, it is the very same type of seat with the same level of comfort, and there are no boxes. Subtitles are visible from every seat except for those at the very back of the arena and of the first balcony. In 2005, two small standing room areas were created at the back of the arena; tickets are sold for €5, only on the evening of the performance. There is no &quot;royal&quot; or &quot;presidential box&quot;; instead, one of the regular seats in the arena, on the &quot;VIP&quot; row (row 15) just after the central aisle, is considered the presidential seat, although not all Presidents since 1989 have been avid opera-goers.

Due to its size, the auditorium is frequently—and unfavourably—called a &quot;vessel&quot;, and, compared to other world-class opera houses, the acoustics have been described as at best disappointing. One technical feature destined to make it better is that the floor of the orchestra pit is actually a small elevator, which makes it possible to adapt the pit to the requirements of the performance, elevating it for a smaller orchestra and lowering it for a larger and louder one; in its largest configuration, the pit has room for 130 players.

The hall is generally cold in colour due to the prominence of grey granite, black or white stone and black fabric in the structure and decoration as well as to the lightning from the giant white glass ceiling, although the use of pearwood for the seats and handrails and of oak for the floor brings a warmer, light brown touch. This modern design has been controversial ever since the house&#x27;s opening, with part of the audience preferring the elaborately ornate and gilded decoration of the traditional Palais Garnier.

The backstage occupies an enormous area (5,000 m2), six times larger than the stage: the stage area is flanked left and right with areas of the same size, and these three areas are replicated towards the back of the theatre. A system of rails and a rotating dock make it possible to roll entire sets on and off on giant motorised platforms in a few minutes and to store these platforms on the available backstage spots; quick changes of set enable the artists to rehearse a work in the afternoon and to perform another one in the evening within the same space, something impossible at the Palais Garnier. The use of such platforms also makes it considerably easier to use three-dimensional sets rather than traditional flat images. Under the stage is a giant elevator, which is used to lower unused set platforms to an underground storehouse as large as the backstage itself.

The building also includes a rehearsal room that is identical in size and shape to the theatre&#x27;s pit and stage areas.

<text>Baron Fisher, of Kilverstone in the County of Norfolk, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1909 for the noted naval reformer Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Fisher.

His son Cecil Fisher, the second Baron, was the adoptive heir of Josiah Vavasseur (1834–1908), an arms manufacturer. Vavasseur left part of his enormous estate to Fisher on the condition that he adopted the Vavasseur name. Fisher assumed the additional surname of Vavasseur in 1909 by Royal licence. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded in 2012.

The family seat is Kilverstone Hall, near Kilverstone, Norfolk.

<doc id="485072" wikidata="Q2613815" url="?curid=485072" title="Florida-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Florida&quot;-class battleships of the United States Navy comprised two ships: and . Launched in 1910 and 1909 respectively and commissioned in 1911, they were slightly larger than the preceding design but were otherwise very similar. This was the first US battleship class in which all ships received steam turbine engines. In the previous &quot;Delaware&quot;-class, received steam turbine propulsion as an experiment while retained triple-expansion engines.

Both ships were involved in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz, deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation. Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. &quot;Florida&quot; was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France for the peace negotiations. &quot;Utah&quot; was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent.

Retained under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers installed and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. &quot;Florida&quot; was scrapped, &quot;Utah&quot; converted into first a radio-controlled target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Her hull became deeply stuck in silt and mud as she sank, and thus was never raised. It remains on the bottom of the harbor as a war memorial.

== Design ==

The &quot;Florida&quot;s were the third of 10 separate classes built between 1906 and 1919, a total of 22 battleships being commissioned. The new dreadnoughts of the American battle line were being designed from pre-dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs, as no US dreadnought had yet been commissioned at the time that the &quot;Florida&quot;s were designed; all were either at some stage of building or in design. American capital ship design was also heavily influenced by war games conducted at the US Navy&#x27;s Naval War College. Captain William Sims led a reform movement that assigned warship design to the General Board.

These ships were an improvement over the preceding . Their engine rooms were larger to hold four Curtis or Parsons steam turbines. Their larger beam gave them greater metacentric height, in which the &quot;Delaware&quot;s were notably deficient, which improved buoyancy and reduced hull stress. The ships mounted new /51-caliber guns as secondary batteries in casemates that boasted increased armor protection. The class retained the large and fully enclosed conning towers that were adopted for the preceding &quot;Delaware&quot;s, as a result of American studies of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The design reduced the vulnerability of the command staff. Overall, these ships were much better protected than their British counterparts, although they were modified extensively during the interwar period.

=== General characteristics ===

The &quot;Florida&quot;-class ships were long at the waterline and overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at standard displacement and at full load. This was an increase of approximately over the previous &quot;Delaware&quot; class. The ships also had some of their superstructure rearranged, including the lattice masts and the funnels. The &quot;Florida&quot;-class ships had a crew of 1,001 officers and men. The wider beam increased the vessels&#x27; metacentric height, which allowed the &quot;Florida&quot;s to accommodate their larger medium-caliber guns without any real penalty in topweight.

&quot;Florida&quot; was fitted experimentally with a larger bridge than was then standard, to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor, while &quot;Utah&quot; received a heavily armored fire-control tower atop a standard-sized bridge. The former proved especially successful, to the point that when a larger armored fire-control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the &quot;Nevada&quot; class, it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of &quot;Florida&quot;.

The two ships were modernized in 1925–27; among the improvements were the addition of torpedo bulges, which were designed to increase resistance to underwater damage—this widened the ships to . The ships also had their rear lattice masts removed and replaced with a pole mast. A catapult for launching aircraft was mounted on the number 3 gun turret.

=== Propulsion ===

The ships were propelled by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines; steam was provided by 12 Babcock &amp; Wilcox coal-fired boilers. The engines were rated at to give a top speed of . On trials, &quot;Florida&quot; made on ; &quot;Utah&quot;″s turbines produced only but still propelled the ship at . However, the engine and boiler room arrangements remained the same as in the &quot;Delaware&quot;s, with the engine room situated between the rear main turrets and steam lines running beneath the superfiring rear turret. The ships had a range of at a cruising speed of .

The engine rooms on these ships were lengthened to accommodate the larger Parsons steam turbines, which meant the after boiler room had to be eliminated. Funnel spacing was therefore closer than in the &quot;Delaware&quot;s. The remaining boiler rooms were widened by ; to do this and maintain adequate underwater and coal bunker protection, the ships were made beamier than the &quot;Delaware&quot;s. During &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Utah&quot;″s reconstruction in 1925–1927, their coal-fired boilers were replaced with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers. The reduction in the number of boilers allowed their twin funnels to be trunked into one single larger funnel.

=== Armament ===
==== Main guns ====
It was intended originally to arm these ships with eight /45-caliber guns then in development in superfiring fore-and-aft mountings. As this gun did not go into service until 1914, the arrangement of ten /45-caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets was retained from the &quot;Delaware&quot; class. The gun housings were the Mark 8 type, and they allowed for depression to −5 degrees and elevation to 15 degrees. The guns had a rate of fire of 2 to 3 rounds per minute. They fired shells, of either armor-piercing (AP) or Common types, though the Common type was obsolete by 1915 and put out of production. The propellant charge was in silk bags, and provided a muzzle velocity of . The guns were expected to fire 175 rounds before the barrels would require replacement. The two ships carried 100 shells per gun, or 1,000 rounds in total. At 15 degrees elevation, the guns could hit targets out to approximately 

Unfortunately, the turret layout of the &quot;Delawares&quot; was also retained, with its respective challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, was placed on the main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.

==== Other weapons ====
C&amp;R proposed secondary guns for these ships, protected by casemate armor. This would have been the only change from the protective scheme carried over from the &quot;Delaware&quot; class. However, a new 5-inch/51-caliber gun was adopted instead after concerns about inadequate splinter protection for secondary gun casemates and smoke uptakes led to an increase in armor. Sixteen of these weapons were fitted in individual casemates. These guns fired a armor-piercing (AP) shell at a muzzle velocity of and a rate of 8 to 9 rounds per minute. The guns could depress to −10 degrees and elevate to 15 degrees. The guns were manually operated, and had a range of train of about 150 degrees in either direction.

&quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Utah&quot; received two /23-caliber guns in 1917 for anti-aircraft (AA) defense. This was increased to eight guns between 1926 and 1928. These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of and ceiling of at an elevation of 75 degrees and a rate of between eight and nine rounds per minute.

The ships were also armed with two submerged torpedo tubes. The tubes were mounted one on each broadside. The torpedoes were long and carried a warhead. They had a range of and traveled at a speed of .

=== Armor ===

The armor layout was largely the same as in the preceding &quot;Delaware&quot;-class battleships. The armored belt ranged in thickness from in the more important areas of the ship. Casemated guns mounted in the hull had between of armor plate. After modernization, some of the casemated guns were moved to the superstructure; these guns were protected with only of armor. The barbettes that housed the main gun turrets were armored with between of armor; the side portions more vulnerable to shell fire were thicker, while the front and rear sections of the barbette, which were less likely to be hit, received thinner armor to save weight. The gun turrets themselves were armored with of armor. The conning tower was thick. The armored deck was slightly reduced in thickness, from .

== Construction ==
&quot;Florida&quot;, ordered under hull number &quot;Battleship #30&quot;, was laid down at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York on 9 March 1909. She was launched on 12 May 1910, after which fitting out work commenced. She was completed on 15 September 1911, and commissioned into the United States Navy. &quot;Utah&quot; was ordered under hull number &quot;Battleship #31&quot;. She was laid down in Camden, New Jersey, at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, 6 days later on 15 March. Work proceeded faster on &quot;Utah&quot; than on her sister ship, and she was launched about four and a half months earlier, on 23 December 1909. Her fitting out lasted until 31 August 1911, when she was commissioned into the Navy.

== Service history ==
=== USS &quot;Florida&quot; ===


&quot;Florida&quot; took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in 1914. She and her sister &quot;Utah&quot; were the first two ships on the scene; the two ships landed some 1,000 sailors and Marines under the command of &quot;Florida&quot;″s captain on 21 April. Fighting lasted for 3 days; the contingent from &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Utah&quot; suffered a total of 94 casualties.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Florida&quot; was dispatched to Europe; she departed the United States in December 1917. After arriving in the North Sea, she was assigned to the British Grand Fleet. The ship, part of the US Navy&#x27;s Battleship Division Nine, under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman, arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. Following training exercises with the British fleet, 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with convoy protection duty on the route to Scandinavia. Following the end of the war, in December 1918, the ship escorted President Woodrow Wilson on his trip to Europe to participate in the peace negotiations at Versailles. Later in December, &quot;Florida&quot; returned to the United States to participate in the Victory Fleet Review in New York harbor.

Post-war, &quot;Florida&quot; returned to the US Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet; she operated along the east coast of the United States and into Central America. In July 1920, she was assigned the hull number &quot;BB-30&quot;. In December 1920, she carried the US Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, on a diplomatic trip around the Caribbean and South America. &quot;Florida&quot; was the oldest American battleship that was retained under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. She underwent extensive reconstruction and modernization during the mid-1920s. After emerging from the shipyard, she was assigned as the flagship of the Control Force, US Fleet. The ship conducted a series of training cruises for the remainder of the decade. Under the London Naval Treaty of 1930, the ship was to be discarded. She was decommissioned in February 1931 and towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was broken up for scrap.

=== USS &quot;Utah&quot; ===


&quot;Utah&quot;″s first assignment was with the US Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet. During 1913, she took a goodwill voyage to the Mediterranean. &quot;Utah&quot; was also involved in the Second Battle of Vera Cruz, alongside her sister &quot;Florida&quot;. The ship also saw front-line duty in the First World War, although she was not attached to the British Grand Fleet. Starting in September 1918, &quot;Utah&quot; was based in Bantry Bay, Ireland. Here she conducted convoy escort duties on the approach to Europe.

Post-war service saw &quot;Utah&quot; again in the Atlantic Fleet; during 1921–22, she was stationed in Europe. &quot;Utah&quot; was also retained under the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1924–1925, the ship sailed on a goodwill cruise to South America. Following her return to the United States, she was taken into dry dock for significant reconstruction. After she rejoined the active fleet, she was assigned to the US Scouting Fleet. Late in 1928, she steamed to the South Atlantic, where she picked up President-Elect Herbert Hoover, who was returning from an ambassadorial visit to several South American countries.

According to the London Naval Treaty, the ship was to be removed from front-line service. In 1931 she had her main battery guns removed and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. She was redesignated &quot;AG-16&quot;, and served in this capacity through 1941. In 1935 she was rebuilt again, gaining a single /75-caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon. She continued her role as a target ship, and in 1941 had several additional anti-aircraft guns installed to increase her capacity to train gunners. Later that year she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, was hit by two torpedoes, capsized, and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island in a failed salvage effort, where the wreck remains today.

<doc id="485075" wikidata="Q7426732" url="?curid=485075" title="Saturday Night at the Movies">
<text>Saturday Night at the Movies was a weekly television series on TVOntario, the public educational television network in Ontario, Canada. The series presented classic movies, followed by interviews and feature segments with directors, actors and other people involved in making the films presented.

The show was initially formatted in this way due to requirements that all programming shown on TVO (including dramatic programming) needed to contain educational elements, which was usually accomplished by including interviews and analysis of the programming. Nevertheless, even after these requirements were dropped, the format was maintained; all told, the series presented almost 1,500 films and over 1,000 interviews.

The show was produced for much of its run by Risa Shuman.

==Broadcast history==

===Elwy Yost era===
First aired on March 30, 1974, the program was originally hosted by Elwy Yost. The first film shown was Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot;. During Yost&#x27;s 25-year tenure as host, he showed a variety of foreign films, but tended to concentrate on Hollywood-produced films from the 1930s through the 1950s, slowly expanding into also showing films from the 1960s and 1970s as the series progressed. Films shown spanned all genres; Yost famously said that of all the films he had ever seen in his life, he had disliked only two. For a number of years, however, the show was unable to broadcast films from the Warner Bros. studio, as TVOntario&#x27;s transmitter in Windsor created a programming rights conflict with stations in Detroit.

Although the hosts did interview actors and film directors, they often interviewed film crew, such as cinematographers and film editors, who much more rarely receive widespread publicity.

In his final decade hosting the show, Yost lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, and would travel to Toronto to prepare many episodes of the show at once.

Yost retired as host of the series in 1999. The last film he presented was, atypically, a then-recent Hollywood blockbuster: Yost chose &quot;Speed&quot; to conclude his run as host, as it was written by his son, screenwriter Graham Yost. Around the same time as his retirement, he was inducted into the Order of Canada.

===After Yost===
Soon after Yost&#x27;s retirement, the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris appointed Isabel Bassett as chair of TVOntario, with a mandate to refocus the network&#x27;s broadcast schedule more clearly on education. Although there was some concern that the network would lose &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, its highest-rated program, Bassett instead negotiated an agreement with York University to include the series in its film studies curriculum.

Yost was replaced as host for one season by Shelagh Rogers, concurrently with her continuing role as host of CBC Stereo&#x27;s classical music program &quot;Take Five&quot;. When Rogers became the host of CBC Radio&#x27;s morning news program &quot;This Morning&quot; in 2000, she left &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, which briefly changed to a hostless format. At this time, the series added a Sunday night companion series, &quot;Sunday Night at the Cinema&quot;, which focused more on international film.

The program was then hosted by Johanna Schneller for two seasons beginning in 2004. The show&#x27;s final host, for the remainder of its run, was Thom Ernst.

On November 13, 2012, it was announced that TVO would cancel &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; as of the end of the 2012-2013 season, amidst budget cuts incurred by the network. The final edition of &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; was broadcast on August 31, 2013, featuring two foreign films as its last movies: &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; (at 8 P.M.), and &quot;Black Book&quot; (starting at 10:50 P.M.) 

Copies of many of the show&#x27;s interviews have been donated to the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 21 September 1994. The coalition of the Social Democratic Party, the Danish Social Liberal Party and the Centre Democrats led by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen remained in power despite the Christian People&#x27;s Party, which had been part of the government, failing to cross the 2% threshold and losing all four seats. Voter turnout was 84.3% in Denmark proper, 62.3% in the Faroe Islands and 56.7% in Greenland.

==Results==
The sole elected independent MP in Denmark proper was Jacob Haugaard, who was associated with the Union of Conscientiously Work-Shy Elements. As of 2023, this is the only time an independent candidate has been elected to parliament under the current constitution. The re-election of the prime minister was also notable for being a rare example of Condorcet paradox observed on a country scale, discovered through prior opinion polls.

<doc id="485093" wikidata="Q728476" url="?curid=485093" title="Yevgeny Polivanov">
<text>Yevgeny Dmitrievich Polivanov () was a Soviet linguist, orientalist, and polyglot who wrote major works on the Chinese, Japanese, Uzbek, and Dungan languages and on theoretical linguistics and poetics.

== Life ==
He participated in the development of writing systems for the peoples of the Soviet Union and also designed a cyrillization system for Japanese language, which was officially accepted in the Soviet Union and is still the standard in modern Russia. He also translated the Kyrgyz national Epic of Manas into Russian. Polivanov is credited as the scholar who initiated the comparative study of Japanese pitch accent across dialects.

During the Russian Revolution of 1917, Polivanov was active first in the Menshevik Party, then he joined the Bolshevik Party. He worked in the Oriental section of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in 1917–1918 and in the Comintern in 1921.

In 1928–1929 he expressed disagreement with Nicholas Marr&#x27;s Japhetic theory, which was promoted by the regime at the time. After this he was blackballed from all scholarly institutions in Moscow and Leningrad and until his arrest &quot;was essentially in exile in Central Asia, where he accomplished fruitful work on the local languages.&quot;

During the Great Purge, Polivanov was arrested on 16 August 1937 in Bishkek and was charged with spying for Japan. On 1 October, in the Butyrka prison, he requested in writing that the NKVD halt severe interrogation methods against him, arguing that they made him issue false statements that confused the investigation against him. On 25 January 1938, he was tried in a closed session of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR and pleaded not guilty. He was sentenced to death and executed by NKVD near Moscow. He was rehabilitated in 1963. In late October 2018, a memorial containing his name alongside over 6,000 others was erected at Kommunarka.

<doc id="485108" wikidata="Q750528" url="?curid=485108" title="Fiat Tipo (Type 160)">
<text>The Fiat Tipo (Type 160) is a compact car, designed by the I.DE.A Institute design house, and produced by the Italian manufacturer Fiat between 1988 and 1995.

The Tipo was initially available only as a five-door hatchback. The car was made entirely out of galvanized body panels to avoid rust, and was built on a completely new Fiat platform, which was later also used in Alfa Romeo and Lancia models.

It also stood out because of its boxy styling that gave it innovative levels of packaging, rear passenger room being greater than that in a rear wheel drive Ford Sierra, but in a car that was of a similar size to the smaller Ford Escort. This type of design was comparable to the smaller Fiat Uno, which was launched five years before the Tipo.

In 1989, the Tipo won the European Car of the Year award and the 1989 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland. The car was extremely popular in Brazil where it outsold the Volkswagen Gol, which had been the best selling Brazilian car for more than twenty years. Only the Tipo, the Fiat Uno Mille, and Fiat Palio have ever outsold the Gol as well.

==Variants==
Unveiled in January 1988, the Tipo went on sale in Europe during June 1988, and on the right hand drive market in the United Kingdom from 16 July 1988, initially base (i.e.), DGT, (early Italian market DGT models were badged as &#x27;digit&#x27;, presumably in recognition of the digital dash, but this was quickly changed to DGT after a dispute over ownership of the name, leading to confusion about whether the model was diesel powered) S, SX and 16v trim levels were available. &quot;Tipo&quot; is Italian for &quot;type&quot;.

Power from came from 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.8 16v, 2.0, and 2.0 16v petrol engines, as well as a 1.7 diesel, 1.9 diesel, and 1.9 turbodiesel.

The 1.1 base engine was widely regarded as underpowered for the car, which was otherwise roomy for five adults and with above average equipment. This version was never sold in the United Kingdom. The top of the range was the 2.0 &quot;Sedicivalvole&quot; (16 valves).

The &quot;Sedicivalvole&quot; gained its engine from the Lancia Thema, and with a much smaller and lighter bodyshell to house it, this power unit brought superb performance and handling, and a top speed of around , which made it faster than the Volkswagen Golf GTI of that era. The market in the United Kingdom initially received only the 1.4 and 1.6 versions of the Tipo, with the 1.8 and 2.0 petrol engines and the diesel powered units not being imported until the beginning of the 1990s.

The smaller Uno achieved remarkable success in that market throughout the 1980s, reaching its peak with over 40,000 sales in 1988. Both Fiat and the motoring press had high hopes that the Tipo would replicate this triumph, but sales fell short of expectations.
The Tipo was facelifted in 1993, and a three-door version was added, as well as minor exterior changes (the two evolutions of the car can be differentiated by their slightly different radiator grilles and headlamps) and improved specifications; safety features like stiffer bodyshells, driver&#x27;s airbag, and side impact bars were added to the range. This included the new S, SX, and SLX trim levels, as well as a new eight valve 2.0 GT model.

The Italian Tipo production ceased in the summer of 1995 when it was replaced by the three-door Fiat Bravo and five-door Fiat Brava. The Tempra saloon and estate (station wagon) were replaced by the Marea in 1996. The Bravo and Brava were strong sellers throughout Europe, but the Marea was a disappointment in most markets.
It was a reasonably strong seller in the United Kingdom, initially winning plaudits for its innovative and practical design, as well as its good handling. It was originally sold with only 1.4 and 1.6 petrol engines, the 16 valve 1.8 and 2.0 engines with fuel injection became available there in the early 1990s.

The digital dashboard of higher end models proved to be controversial and unreliable.

The car launched into a favourable market in the United Kingdom, where none of the &quot;big three&quot; carmakers (Ford, Vauxhall, and Austin Rover) had launched an all new car of this size for at least four years. However, these three marques all had new Tipo sized products within three years, and increased competition reduced the Tipo&#x27;s sales.

Its fortunes outside Italy also suffered in the beginning of the 1990s, as it was launched around the same time as France&#x27;s Renault 19, and was soon followed by host of other new rivals, including the Citroën ZX.

The final two years (1994 and 1995) saw a significant increase in sales, but these were mostly of the low priced 1.4 litre models.

===Production elsewhere===
In Brazil, it only started to be produced in 1995, in a single trim level. It had a 1.6-litre, eight-valve engine with multi point fuel injection, which offered a increase compared to the old 1.6 litre i.e., producing .

Previously, the Tipo had been imported from Italy and was available with three different trims that were closely associated with its engines: the basic 1.6 i.e., the luxurious 2.0 litre (eight valve), and the sporty two litre, sixteen valve &quot;Sedicivalvole&quot;. Seventeen 1.7-litre models were also brought in; they are all in Estoril Blue color and received complete equipment.
It was also built in Turkey, by Tofaş. The Turkish built cars generally did not feature catalytic converters and some thus have marginally more power than the models listed in the table beneath. The Turkish cars also have a small &quot;Tofaş&quot; logo on the bottom right side of the bootlid; production there continued at least until 2000.

==Derivatives==
The Tipo platform spawned nine more cars. The first of these was the Yugo Sana/Zastava Florida in November 1988, followed by the Lancia Dedra sedan in April 1989 and the Fiat Tempra in February 1990. The sporting Alfa Romeo 155 sedan, the coupé Fiat Coupé and the Lancia Delta Nuova were all introduced in 1993, and were also built on the Tipo platform, as were the Alfa Romeo 145 and 146 and the Alfa Romeo Spider and GTV (with a different rear suspension and other chassis refinements) from 1994 to 1995.

<text>GDP (PPP) means gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity. 
This article includes a list of countries by their forecast estimated GDP (PPP). Countries are sorted by GDP (PPP) forecast estimates from financial and statistical institutions that calculate using market or government official exchange rates. The data given on this page are based on the international dollar, a standardized unit used by economists. Certain regions that are not widely considered countries such as Hong Kong also show up in the list if they are distinct jurisdiction areas or economic entities.

GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing the domestic market of a state because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income. It is however limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries. PPP is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the United Nations in constructing the human development index. These surveys such as the International Comparison Program include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods.

The first set of data on the left columns of the table includes estimates for the year 2023 made for each economy of the 196 economies (189 U.N. member states and 7 areas of Aruba, Hong Kong, Kosovo, Macau, Palestine, Puerto Rico, and Taiwan) covered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#x27;s International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. The data is in millions of international dollars and was calculated and published by the IMF in October 2023. The second table includes data, mostly for the year 2022, for 180 of the 193 current United Nations member states as well as Hong Kong and Macau (the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions). Data are in millions of international dollars; they were compiled by the World Bank. The third table is a tabulation of the CIA World Factbook GDP (PPP) data update of 2019. The data for GDP at purchasing power parity has also been rebased using the new International Comparison Program price surveys and extrapolated to 2007. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in .

<text>Salmiakki Koskenkorva, (also Salmiakkikossu for short, or Salmari more colloquially) is a pre-mixed liqueur popular in Finland. Traditionally, the cocktail consisted of Koskenkorva Viina vodka with salmiakki extract dissolved into it. Sometimes, ground-up &quot;Tyrkisk Peber&quot; is used instead of the extract.

Salmiakki Koskenkorva is a somewhat viscous black liquid, or a dark grayish brown when of a thinner consistency. Upon closer inspection, very fine particles of carbon black are visibly suspended in the liquid.

Before the 1990s, Finland had a very thin and stratified cocktail culture. Some Finnish bars started serving a cocktail made out of ground ammonium chloride-based candy (Salmiakki in Finnish). It became a trendy drink, especially among young people, and for this reason it still has a reputation as a &quot;teenagers&#x27; vodka&quot;. This led to the drink&#x27;s prohibition from 1993 to 1995.

Only anecdotal evidence exists regarding the origin and the recipe of the beverage. The concept of mixing vodka and liquorice probably existed long before the 1990s, since both Koskenkorva Viina and Tyrkisk Peber were around before the alleged invention of the cocktail. On the other hand, Salmiakki Koskenkorva was one of the first pre-mixed cocktails sold in Finland. A well-known anecdote says that singer Jari Sillanpää invented the drink when he was working as a bartender in the late 1980s.

The taste of Salmiakki Koskenkorva strongly resembles that of black liquorice and cough medicine. This is because one of the popular brands of salmiakki used for the drink, Apteekin Salmiakki, is also used in cough medicines. It has the additional effect of increasing salivation.

<text>Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross (born 16 January 1968) is an English musician, composer, record producer, and audio engineer. He is best known for his work with American musician Trent Reznor, with whom he first worked on the musical project Tapeworm in 2002. He began working with Reznor&#x27;s band Nine Inch Nails in 2005 as a programmer and producer, then joined as a musician and became the only official member of the band other than Reznor in 2016.

Outside of Nine Inch Nails, Ross and Reznor have become known for their work on film scores. They won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for &quot;The Social Network&quot; in 2010, the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; in 2013, and the Golden Globe and Academy Award for &quot;Soul&quot; (alongside Jon Batiste) in 2021.

Ross was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Nine Inch Nails in 2020. He and Reznor co-created the virtual supergroup WitchGang in 2023.

== Early life ==
Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross was born in the Ladbroke Grove area of London on 16 January 1968, the son of Roxana Rose Catherine Naila and Radio Caroline co-founder Ian Cowper Ross. His maternal grandfather was diplomat Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn who was the grandson of fur merchant Curtis Lampson He has five siblings, including fellow musician Leopold Ross and fashion model Liberty Ross. His great-grandfather was Italian pathologist and bacteriologist Aldo Castellani while his uncle is English-American journalist Charles Glass. Ross was educated at Eton College and later at the Courtauld Institute of Art.

== Career ==
=== Music ===

Ross came to notice in the mid-1990s as a synthesizer programmer for Tim Simenon&#x27;s Bomb the Bass during the period of the albums &quot;Unknown Territory&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot;. He worked on a number of production and remix projects with Simenon, as well as forming a collaborative relationship with Barry Adamson. He programmed &quot;The Negro Inside Me&quot; and &quot;Oedipus Schmoedipus&quot;, and produced &quot;As Above So Below&quot; before forming his own band, 12 Rounds, with his wife Claudia Sarne and Adam Holden. They released two albums, &quot;Jitterjuice&quot; and &quot;My Big Hero&quot;. A third full-length album was produced by Trent Reznor, but was ultimately never finished. Three songs from that album have since been released on the band&#x27;s website.

Ross moved to the United States in 2000, and as of 2002 was working alongside Reznor for his side project Tapeworm. He has been credited as a producer and/or programmer on the Nine Inch Nails albums &quot;With Teeth&quot;, &quot;Year Zero&quot;, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot; (on which he was a co-writer), &quot;The Slip&quot;, and &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;. He has worked with Reznor in numerous other capacities, including work with Saul Williams and Zack de la Rocha, and they co-produced tracks for a reformed Jane&#x27;s Addiction with Alan Moulder in 2009.

Other work has included two co-productions with Joe Barresi, the Loverman EP &quot;Human Nurture&quot; and Coheed and Cambria&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot;, as well as albums for Korn. He has also produced tracks or created remixes for such artists as Grace Jones, Perry Farrell, and Telepathe. In May 2010, he appeared in a cryptic video and was named as a member of a secret project, later revealed to be How to Destroy Angels, a collaboration between Reznor and his wife Mariqueen Maandig. In 2016, Ross composed an original score titled &#x27;The Journey&#x27; for &quot;FIFA 17&quot; new single-player story campaign mode. In 2020, he co-produced and co-wrote one track on Jehnny Beth&#x27;s &quot;To Love Is to Live&quot;. In 2021, Ross and Reznor produced and co-wrote Halsey&#x27;s album &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have Love, I Want Power&quot;.

=== Film and television scores ===
Ross&#x27; work in film music began in 2004 when he scored the Hughes Brothers&#x27; TV series &quot;Touching Evil&quot; with his wife Claudia Sarne and brother Leopold Ross. He has since provided music for two further Hughes Brothers projects: Allen Hughes&#x27; vignette in the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;, and Ross&#x27; first feature film, &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010). The latter&#x27;s score was released through Reprise Records on 12 January 2010. It won at the BMI Awards and earned Ross a nomination as &quot;Discovery of the Year&quot; at the 2010 World Soundtrack Awards.

On 16 January 2011, they won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for their score to &quot;The Social Network&quot;. On 27 February, they received the Academy Award for Best Original Score for &quot;The Social Network&quot;. Ross and Reznor again collaborated on the soundtrack to Fincher&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. In 2013, the pair won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for their &quot;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; soundtrack.

Ross was slated to work on the 2013 samurai epic &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, but was soon replaced by Javier Navarrete. Ross and Reznor again teamed up with Fincher to score his 2014 film &quot;Gone Girl&quot;. In 2016, Ross and Reznor, along with composer Gustavo Santaolalla and the band Mogwai, collaborated to create the score to the documentary film &quot;Before the Flood&quot;.

In June 2017, Ross, along with Reznor, Maandig, Robin Finck, Joey Castillo, and Alessandro Cortini, appeared as &quot;The Nine Inch Nails&quot; in Episode 8 of &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; on Showtime, performing an alternative live rendition of the song &quot;She&#x27;s Gone Away&quot; which previously appeared on Nine Inch Nails&#x27; 2016 EP &quot;Not the Actual Events&quot;.

<text>In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process of assigning local automatic variables and expression results to a limited number of processor registers.

Register allocation can happen over a basic block (&quot;local register allocation&quot;), over a whole function/procedure (&quot;global register allocation&quot;), or across function boundaries traversed via call-graph (&quot;interprocedural register allocation&quot;). When done per function/procedure the calling convention may require insertion of save/restore around each call-site.

== Context ==
=== Principle ===

In many programming languages, the programmer may use any number of variables. The computer can quickly read and write registers in the CPU, so the computer program runs faster when more variables can be in the CPU&#x27;s registers. Also, sometimes code accessing registers is more compact, so the code is smaller, and can be fetched faster if it uses registers rather than memory. However, the number of registers is limited. Therefore, when the compiler is translating code to machine-language, it must decide how to allocate variables to the limited number of registers in the CPU.

Not all variables are in use (or &quot;live&quot;) at the same time, so, over the lifetime of a program, a given register may be used to hold different variables. However, two variables in use at the &quot;same&quot; time cannot be assigned to the same register without corrupting one of the variables. If there are not enough registers to hold all the variables, some variables may be moved to and from RAM. This process is called &quot;spilling&quot; the registers. Over the lifetime of a program, a variable can be both spilled and stored in registers: this variable is then considered as &quot;split&quot;. Accessing RAM is significantly slower than accessing registers and so a compiled program runs slower. Therefore, an optimizing compiler aims to assign as many variables to registers as possible. A high &quot;Register pressure&quot; is a technical term that means that more spills and reloads are needed; it is defined by Braun et al. as &quot;the number of simultaneously live variables at an instruction&quot;.

In addition, some computer designs cache frequently-accessed registers. So, programs can be further optimized by assigning the same register to a source and destination of a codice_1 instruction whenever possible. This is especially important if the compiler is using an intermediate representation such as static single-assignment form (SSA). In particular, when SSA is not fully optimized it can artificially generate additional codice_1 instructions.

=== Components of register allocation ===
Register allocation consists therefore of choosing where to store the variables at runtime, i.e. inside or outside registers. If the variable is to be stored in registers, then the allocator needs to determine in which register(s) this variable will be stored. Eventually, another challenge is to determine the duration for which a variable should stay at the same location.

A register allocator, disregarding the chosen allocation strategy, can rely on a set of core actions to address these challenges. These actions can be gathered in several different categories:
;Move insertion: This action consists of increasing the number of move instructions between registers, i.e. make a variable live in different registers during its lifetime, instead of one. This occurs in the split live range approach. 
;Spilling: This action consists of storing a variable into memory instead of registers.
;Assignment: This action consists of assigning a register to a variable.
;Coalescing: This action consists of limiting the number of moves between registers, thus limiting the total number of instructions. For instance, by identifying a variable live across different methods, and storing it into one register during its whole lifetime.
Many register allocation approaches optimize for one or more specific categories of actions.
===Common problems raised in register allocation===
Register allocation raises several problems that can be tackled (or avoided) by different register allocation approaches. Three of the most common problems are identified as follows:

;Aliasing: In some architectures, assigning a value to one register can affect the value of another: this is called aliasing. For example, the x86 architecture has four general purpose 32-bit registers that can also be used as 16-bit or 8-bit registers. In this case, assigning a 32-bit value to the eax register will affect the value of the al register.

;Pre-coloring: This problem is an act to force some variables to be assigned to particular registers. For example, in PowerPC calling conventions, parameters are commonly passed in R3-R10 and the return value is passed in R3.

;NP-Problem: Chaitin et al. showed that register allocation is an NP-complete problem. They reduce the graph coloring problem to the register allocation problem by showing that for an arbitrary graph, a program can be constructed such that the register allocation for the program (with registers representing nodes and machine registers representing available colors) would be a coloring for the original graph. As Graph Coloring is an NP-Hard problem and Register Allocation is in NP, this proves the NP-completeness of the problem.

== Register allocation techniques ==
Register allocation can happen over a basic block of code: it is said to be &quot;local&quot;, and was first mentioned by Horwitz et al. As basic blocks do not contain branches, the allocation process is thought to be fast, because the management of control-flow graph merge points in register allocation reveals itself a time-consuming operation. However, this approach is thought not to produce as optimized code as the &quot;global&quot; approach, which operates over the whole compilation unit (a method or procedure for instance).

=== Graph-coloring allocation ===

Graph-coloring allocation is the predominant approach to solve register allocation. It was first proposed by Chaitin et al.
In this approach, nodes in the graph represent live ranges (variables, temporaries, virtual/symbolic registers) that are candidates for register allocation. Edges connect live ranges that interfere, i.e., live ranges that are simultaneously live at at least one program point. Register allocation then reduces to the graph coloring problem in which colors (registers) are assigned to the nodes such that two nodes connected by an edge do not receive the same color.

Using liveness analysis, an interference graph can be built. The interference graph, which is an undirected graph where the nodes are the program&#x27;s variables, is used to model which variables cannot be allocated to the same register.

==== Principle ====
The main phases in a Chaitin-style graph-coloring register allocator are:

# Renumber: discover live range information in the source program.
# Build: build the interference graph.
# Coalesce: merge the live ranges of non-interfering variables related by copy instructions.
# Spill cost: compute the spill cost of each variable. This assesses the impact of mapping a variable to memory on the speed of the final program.
# Simplify: construct an ordering of the nodes in the inferences graph
# Spill Code: insert spill instructions, i.e. loads and stores to commute values between registers and memory.
# Select: assign a register to each variable.

==== Drawbacks and further improvements ====
The graph-coloring allocation has three major drawbacks. First, it relies on graph-coloring, which is an NP-complete problem, to decide which variables are spilled. Finding a minimal coloring graph is indeed an NP-complete problem. Second, unless live-range splitting is used, evicted variables are spilled everywhere: store instructions are inserted as early as possible, i.e., just after variable definitions; load instructions are respectively inserted late, just before variable use. Third, a variable that is not spilled is kept in the same register throughout its whole lifetime.

On the other hand, a single register name may appear in multiple register classes, where a class is a set of register names that are interchangeable in a particular role. Then, multiple register names may be aliases for a single hardware register. 
Finally, graph coloring is an aggressive technique for allocating registers, but is computationally expensive due to its use of the interference graph, which can have a worst-case size that is quadratic in the number of live ranges.
The traditional formulation of graph-coloring register allocation implicitly assumes a single bank of non-overlapping general-purpose registers and does not handle irregular architectural features like overlapping registers pairs, special purpose registers and multiple register banks.

One later improvement of Chaitin-style graph-coloring approach was found by Briggs et al.: it is called conservative coalescing. This improvement adds a criterion to decide when two live ranges can be merged. Mainly, in addition to the non-interfering requirements, two variables can only be coalesced if their merging will not cause further spilling. Briggs et al. introduces a second improvement to Chaitin&#x27;s works which is biased coloring. Biased coloring tries to assign the same color in the graph-coloring to live range that are copy related.

=== Linear scan ===

Linear scan is another global register allocation approach. It was first proposed by Poletto et al. in 1999. In this approach, the code is not turned into a graph. Instead, all the variables are linearly scanned to determine their live range, represented as an interval. Once the live ranges of all variables have been figured out, the intervals are traversed chronologically. Although this traversal could help identifying variables whose live ranges interfere, no interference graph is being built and the variables are allocated in a greedy way.

The motivation for this approach is speed; not in terms of execution time of the generated code, but in terms of time spent in code generation. Typically, the standard graph coloring approaches produce quality code, but have a significant overhead, the used graph coloring algorithm having a quadratic cost. Owing to this feature, linear scan is the approach currently used in several JIT compilers, like the Hotspot client compiler, V8, Jikes RVM, and the Android Runtime (ART). The Hotspot server compiler uses graph coloring for its superior code.

==== Pseudocode ====

This describes the algorithm as first proposed by Poletto et al., where:
* R is the number of available registers.
* active is the list, sorted in order of increasing end point, of live intervals overlapping the current point and placed in registers.

 LinearScanRegisterAllocation
 active ← {}
 for each live interval &quot;i&quot;, in order of increasing start point do
 ExpireOldIntervals(i)
 if length(active) = R then
 SpillAtInterval(i)
 else
 register[i] ← a register removed from pool of free registers
 add &quot;i&quot; to active, sorted by increasing end point
 ExpireOldIntervals(i)
 for each interval &quot;j&quot; in active, in order of increasing end point do
 if endpoint[j] ≥ startpoint[i] then
 return 
 remove &quot;j&quot; from active
 add register[j] to pool of free registers
 SpillAtInterval(i)
 spill ← last interval in active
 if endpoint[spill] &gt; endpoint[i] then
 register[i] ← register[spill]
 location[spill] ← new stack location
 remove spill from active
 add &quot;i&quot; to active, sorted by increasing end point
 else
 location[i] ← new stack location

==== Drawbacks and further improvements ====
However, the linear scan presents two major drawbacks. First, due to its greedy aspect, it does not take lifetime holes into account, i.e. &quot;ranges where the value of the variable is not needed&quot;. Besides, a spilled variable will stay spilled for its entire lifetime.

Many other research works followed up on the Poletto&#x27;s linear scan algorithm. Traub et al., for instance, proposed an algorithm called second-chance binpacking aiming at generating code of better quality. In this approach, spilled variables get the opportunity to be stored later in a register by using a different heuristic from the one used in the standard linear scan algorithm. Instead of using live intervals, the algorithm relies on live ranges, meaning that if a range needs to be spilled, it is not necessary to spill all the other ranges corresponding to this variable.

Linear scan allocation was also adapted to take advantage from the SSA form: the properties of this intermediate representation simplify the allocation algorithm and allow lifetime holes to be computed directly. First, the time spent in data-flow graph analysis, aimed at building the lifetime intervals, is reduced, namely because variables are unique. It consequently produces shorter live intervals, because each new assignment corresponds to a new live interval. To avoid modeling intervals and liveness holes, Rogers showed a simplification called future-active sets that successfully removed intervals for 80% of instructions.

===Rematerialization===
=== Coalescing ===

In the context of register allocation, coalescing is the act of merging variable-to-variable move operations by allocating those two variables to the same location. The coalescing operation takes place after the interference graph is built. Once two nodes have been coalesced, they must get the same color and be allocated to the same register, once the copy operation becomes unnecessary.

Doing coalescing might have both positive and negative impacts on the colorability of the interference graph. For example, one negative impact that coalescing could have on graph inference colorability is when two nodes are coalesced, as the result node will have a union of the edges of those being coalesced.
A positive impact of coalescing on inference graph colorability is, for example, when a node interferes with both nodes being coalesced, the degree of the node is reduced by one which leads to improving the overall colorability of the interference graph.

There are several coalescing heuristics available:

; Aggressive coalescing: it was first introduced by Chaitin original register allocator. This heuristic aims at coalescing any non-interfering, copy-related nodes. From the perspective of copy elimination, this heuristic has the best results. On the other hand, aggressive coalescing could impact the colorability of the inference graph.
;Conservative Coalescing: it mainly uses the same heuristic as aggressive coalescing but it merges moves if, and only if, it does not compromise the colorability of the interference graph.
;Iterated coalescing: it removes one particular move at the time, while keeping the colorability of the graph.
;Optimistic coalescing: it is based on aggressive coalescing, but if the inference graph colorability is compromised, then it gives up as few moves as possible.

=== Mixed approaches ===
==== Hybrid allocation ====
Some other register allocation approaches do not limit to one technique to optimize register&#x27;s use. Cavazos et al., for instance, proposed a solution where it is possible to use both the linear scan and the graph coloring algorithms. In this approach, the choice between one or the other solution is determined dynamically: first, a machine learning algorithm is used &quot;offline&quot;, that is to say not at runtime, to build a heuristic function that determines which allocation algorithm needs to be used. The heuristic function is then used at runtime; in light of the code behavior, the allocator can then choose between one of the two available algorithms.

Trace register allocation is a recent approach developed by Eisl et al. This technique handles the allocation locally: it relies on dynamic profiling data to determine which branches will be the most frequently used in a given control flow graph. It then infers a set of &quot;traces&quot; (i.e. code segments) in which the merge point is ignored in favor of the most used branch. Each trace is then independently processed by the allocator. This approach can be considered as hybrid because it is possible to use different register allocation algorithms between the different traces.

==== Split allocation ====
Split allocation is another register allocation technique that combines different approaches, usually considered as opposite. For instance, the hybrid allocation technique can be considered as split because the first heuristic building stage is performed offline, and the heuristic use is performed online. In the same fashion, B. Diouf et al. proposed an allocation technique relying both on offline and online behaviors, namely static and dynamic compilation. During the offline stage, an optimal spill set is first gathered using Integer Linear Programming. Then, live ranges are annotated using the codice_3 algorithm which relies on the previously identified optimal spill set. Register allocation is performed afterwards during the online stage, based on the data collected in the offline phase.
In 2007, Bouchez et al. suggested as well to split the register allocation in different stages, having one stage dedicated to spilling, and one dedicated to coloring and coalescing.

== Comparison between the different techniques ==
Several metrics have been used to assess the performance of one register allocation technique against the other. Register allocation has typically to deal with a trade-off between code quality, i.e. code that executes quickly, and analysis overhead, i.e. the time spent determining analyzing the source code to generate code with optimized register allocation. From this perspective, execution time of the generated code and time spent in liveness analysis are relevant metrics to compare the different techniques.

Once relevant metrics have been chosen, the code on which the metrics will be applied should be available and relevant to the problem, either by reflecting the behavior of real-world application, or by being relevant to the particular problem the algorithm wants to address. The more recent articles about register allocation uses especially the Dacapo benchmark suite.

<text>In United States history, the Gilded Age is the period from about the late 1870s to the late 1890s, which occurred between the Reconstruction era and the Progressive Era. It was named by 1920s historians after Mark Twain&#x27;s 1873 novel &quot;The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today&quot;. Historians saw late 19th-century economic expansion as a time of materialistic excesses marked by widespread political corruption.

It was a time of rapid economic growth, especially in the Northern and Western United States. As American wages grew much higher than those in Europe, especially for skilled workers, and industrialization demanded an increasingly skilled labor force, the period saw an influx of millions of European immigrants. The rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 40% from 1860 to 1890 and spread across the increasing labor force. The average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 ($ in dollars) to $584 in 1890 ($ in dollars), a gain of 59%. The Gilded Age was also an era of poverty, especially in the South, and growing inequality, as millions of immigrants poured into the United States, and the high concentration of wealth became more visible and contentious.

Railroads were the major growth industry, with the factory system, oil, mining, and finance increasing in importance. Immigration from Europe and the Eastern United States led to the rapid growth of the West based on farming, ranching, and mining. Labor unions became increasingly important in the rapidly growing industrial cities. Two major nationwide depressions—the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893—interrupted growth and caused social and political upheavals.

The South remained economically devastated after the American Civil War; the region&#x27;s economy became increasingly tied to commodities like food and building materials, cotton for thread and fabrics, and tobacco production, all of which suffered from low prices. With the end of the Reconstruction era in 1877 and the rise of Jim Crow laws, African American people in the South were stripped of political power and voting rights, and were left severely economically disadvantaged.

The political landscape was notable in that despite rampant corruption, election turnout was comparatively high among all classes (though the extent of the franchise was generally limited to men), and national elections featured two similarly sized parties. The dominant issues were cultural (especially regarding prohibition, education, and ethnic or racial groups) and economic (tariffs and money supply). Urban politics were tied to rapidly growing industrial cities, which increasingly fell under control of political machines. In business, powerful nationwide trusts formed in some industries. Unions crusaded for the eight-hour working day, and the abolition of child labor; middle-class reformers demanded civil service reform, prohibition of liquor and beer, and women&#x27;s suffrage.

Local governments across the North and West built public schools chiefly at the elementary level; public high schools started to emerge. The numerous religious denominations were growing in membership and wealth, with Catholicism becoming the largest. They all expanded their missionary activity to the world arena. Catholics, Lutherans, and Episcopalians set up religious schools, and the largest of those schools set up numerous colleges, hospitals, and charities. Many of the problems faced by society, especially the poor, gave rise to attempted reforms in the subsequent Progressive Era.

==The name and the era==
The term &quot;Gilded Age&quot; was applied to the era by 1920s historians who took the term from one of Mark Twain&#x27;s lesser-known novels, &quot;The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today&quot; (1873). The book (co-written with Charles Dudley Warner) satirized the promised &quot;golden age&quot; after the Civil War, portrayed as an era of serious social problems masked by a thin gold gilding of economic expansion. In the 1920s, and 1930s, the metaphor &quot;Gilded Age&quot; began to be applied to a designated period in American history. The term was adopted by literary and cultural critics as well as historians, including Van Wyck Brooks, Lewis Mumford, Charles Austin Beard, Mary Ritter Beard, Vernon Louis Parrington, and Matthew Josephson. For them, &quot;Gilded Age&quot; was a pejorative term for a time of materialistic excesses and widespread political corruption.

The early half of the Gilded Age roughly coincided with the middle portion of the Victorian Era in Britain and the Belle Époque in France. With respect to eras of American history, historical views vary as to when the Gilded Age began, ranging from starting right after the Civil War ended in 1865, or 1873, or as the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877. The date marking the end of the Gilded Age also varies. The ending is generally given as the beginning of the Progressive Era in the 1890s (sometimes the United States presidential election of 1896).

==Industrial and technological advances==

===Technical advances===
The Gilded Age was a period of economic growth as the United States jumped to the lead in industrialization ahead of Britain. The nation was rapidly expanding its economy into new areas, especially heavy industry like factories, railroads, and coal mining. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad opened up the far-west mining and ranching regions. Travel from New York to San Francisco then took six days instead of six months. Railroad track mileage tripled from 1860 to 1880, and then doubled again by 1920. The new track linked formerly isolated areas with larger markets and allowed for the rise of commercial farming, ranching, and mining, creating a truly national marketplace. American steel production rose to surpass the combined totals of Britain, Germany, and France.

Investors in London and Paris poured money into the railroads through the American financial market centered in Wall Street. By 1900, the process of economic concentration had extended into most branches of industry—a few large corporations, called &quot;trusts&quot;, dominated in steel, oil, sugar, meat, and farm machinery. Through vertical integration these trusts were able to control each aspect of the production of a specific good, ensuring that the profits made on the finished product were maximized and prices minimized, and by controlling access to the raw materials, prevented other companies from being able to compete in the marketplace. Several monopolies—most famously Standard Oil—came to dominate their markets by keeping prices low when competitors appeared; they grew at a rate four times faster than that of the competitive sectors.
Increased mechanization of industry is a major mark of the Gilded Age&#x27;s search for cheaper ways to create more product. Frederick Winslow Taylor observed that worker efficiency in steel could be improved through the use of very close observations with a stop watch to eliminate wasted effort. Mechanization made some factories an assemblage of unskilled laborers performing simple and repetitive tasks under the direction of skilled foremen and engineers. Machine shops grew rapidly, and they comprised highly skilled workers and engineers. Both the number of unskilled and skilled workers increased, as their wage rates grew.

Engineering colleges were established to feed the enormous demand for expertise, many through the Federal government sponsored Morrill Land-Grant Acts passed to stimulate public education, particularly in the agricultural and technical (&quot;Ag &amp; Tech&quot;) fields. Railroads, which had previously invented railroad time to standardize time zones, production, and lifestyles, created modern management, with clear chains of command, statistical reporting, and complex bureaucratic systems. They systematized the roles of middle managers and set up explicit career tracks for both skilled blue-collar jobs and for white-collar managers. These advances spread from railroads into finance, manufacturing, and trade. Together with rapid growth of small business, a new middle class was rapidly growing, especially in northern cities.

The nation became a world leader in applied technology. From 1860 to 1890, 500,000 patents were issued for new inventions—over ten times the number granted in the previous seventy years. George Westinghouse invented air brakes for trains (making them both safer and faster). Theodore Vail established the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and built a great communications network. Elisha Otis developed the elevator, allowing the construction of skyscrapers and the concentration of ever greater populations in urban centers. Thomas Edison, in addition to inventing hundreds of devices, established the first electrical lighting utility, basing it on direct current and an efficient incandescent lamp. Electric power delivery spread rapidly across Gilded Age cities. The streets were lit at night, and electric streetcars allowed for faster commuting to work and easier shopping.

Petroleum launched a new industry beginning with the Pennsylvania oil fields in the 1860s. The United States dominated the global industry into the 1950s. Kerosene replaced whale oil and candles for lighting homes. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil Company and monopolized the oil industry. It mostly produced kerosene before the automobile created a demand for gasoline in the 20th century.

===Railroads===
According to historian Henry Adams the system of railroads needed:
:the energies of a generation, for it required all the new machinery to be created—capital, banks, mines, furnaces, shops, power-houses, technical knowledge, mechanical population, together with a steady remodelling of social and political habits, ideas, and institutions to fit the new scale and suit the new conditions. The generation from 1865 to 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.
The impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.

====Shipping freight and passengers====
Railroads provided a highly efficient network for shipping freight and passengers throughout the U.S., spurring the evolution of a large national market. This had a transformative impact on most sectors of the economy including manufacturing, retail and wholesale, agriculture, and finance. The result was an integrated market practically the size of Europe&#x27;s, with no internal barriers, tariffs, or language barriers to hamper it, and a common financial and legal system to support it.

====Basis of the private financial system====
Railroad financing provided the basis for a dramatic expansion of the private financial system. Construction of railroads was far more expensive than factories. In 1860, the combined total of railroad stocks and bonds was $1.8 billion; 1897, it reached $10.6 billion (compared to a total national debt of $1.2 billion). Funding came primarily from private finance throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain, with about 10 percent coming from the Federal government, especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened. The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. By 1860, New York was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914. In 1914–1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.

====Inventing modern management====
Railroad management designed complex systems that could handle far more complicated simultaneous relationships than could be dreamed of by the local factory owner who could patrol every part of his own factory in a matter of hours. Civil engineers became the senior management of railroads. The leading innovators were the Western Railroad of Massachusetts and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1840s, the Erie in the 1850s, and the Pennsylvania in the 1860s.

====Career paths====
The railroads invented the career path in the private sector for both blue- and white-collar workers. Railroading became a lifetime career for young men; women were rarely hired. A typical career path would see a young man hired at age 18 as a shop laborer and promoted to skilled mechanic at age 24, brakeman at 25, freight conductor at 27, and passenger conductor at age 57. White-collar career paths likewise were delineated. Educated young men started in clerical or statistical work and moved up to station agents or bureaucrats at the divisional or central headquarters.

At each level they had more and more knowledge, experience, and human capital. They were very hard to replace and were virtually guaranteed permanent jobs and provided with insurance and medical care. Hiring, firing, and wage rates were set not by foremen, but by central administrators, to minimize favoritism and personality conflicts. Everything was done by the book, whereby an increasingly complex set of rules dictated to everyone exactly what should be done in every circumstance, and exactly what their rank and pay would be. By the 1880s the career railroaders were retiring, and pension systems were invented to provide for them.

====Railroad controversy====
America developed a love-hate relationship with railroads. Boosters in every city worked feverishly to make sure the railroad came through, knowing their urban dreams depended upon it. The mechanical size, scope, and efficiency of the railroads made a profound impression; people dressed in their Sunday best to go down to the terminal to watch the train come in. Travel became much easier, cheaper, and more common. Shoppers from small towns could make day trips to big city stores. Hotels, resorts, and tourist attractions were built to accommodate the demand. The realization that anyone could buy a ticket for a thousand-mile trip was empowering. Historians Gary Cross and Rick Szostak argue:
: With the freedom to travel came a greater sense of national identity and a reduction in regional cultural diversity. Farm children could more easily acquaint themselves with the big city, and easterners could readily visit the West. It is hard to imagine a United States of continental proportions without the railroad.

The civil and mechanical engineers became model citizens, bringing their can-do spirit and their systematic work effort to all phases of the economy as well as local and national government. By 1910, major cities were building magnificent palatial railroad stations, such as the Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and the Union Station in Washington, D.C.

But there was also a dark side. By the 1870s railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger movement theme that monopolistic carriers controlled too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to regulate maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some &quot;Granger Laws&quot; passed. Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric.
One of the most hated railroad men in the country was Collis P. Huntington (1821–1900), the president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, who dominated California&#x27;s economy and politics. One textbook argues: &quot;Huntington came to symbolize the greed and corruption of late-nineteenth-century business. Business rivals and political reformers accused him of every conceivable evil. Journalists and cartoonists made their reputations by pillorying him... Historians have cast Huntington as the state&#x27;s most despicable villain.&quot; However Huntington defended himself: &quot;The motives back of my actions have been honest ones and the results have redounded far more to the benefit of California than they have to my own.&quot;

====Impact on farming====
The growth of railroads from 1850s to 1880s made commercial farming much more feasible and profitable. Millions of acres were opened to settlement once the railroad was nearby, and provided a long-distance outlet for wheat, cattle and hogs that reached all the way to Europe. Rural America became one giant market, as wholesalers bought the consumer products produced by the factories in the East and shipped them to local merchants in small stores nationwide. Shipping live animals was slow and expensive. It was more efficient to slaughter them in major packing centers such as Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati, and then ship dressed meat out in refrigerated freight cars. The cars were cooled by slabs of ice that had been harvested from the northern lakes in wintertime and stored for summer and fall usage. Chicago, the main railroad center, benefited enormously, with Kansas City a distant second. Historian William Cronon concludes:
:Because of the Chicago packers, ranchers in Wyoming and feedlot farmers in Iowa regularly found a reliable market for their animals, and on average received better prices for the animals they sold there. At the same time and for the same reason, Americans of all classes found a greater variety of more and better meats on their tables, purchased on average at lower prices than ever before. Seen in this light, the packers&#x27; &quot;rigid system of economy&quot; seemed a very good thing indeed.

===Economic growth===

During the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S. economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly. For example, from 1865 to 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800%, and miles of railway track by 567%. Thick national networks for transportation and communication were created. The corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a scientific management revolution transformed business operations.

By the beginning of the 20th century, gross domestic product and industrial production in the United States led the world. Kennedy reports that &quot;U.S. national income, in absolute figures in per capita, was so far above everybody else&#x27;s by 1914.&quot; Per capita income in the United States was $377 in 1914 compared to Britain in second place at $244, Germany at $184, France at $153, and Italy at $108, while Russia and Japan trailed far behind at $41 and $36.

London remained the financial center of the world until 1914, yet the United States&#x27; growth caused foreigners to ask, as British author W. T. Stead wrote in 1901, &quot;What is the secret of American success?&quot; The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and hired an ethnically diverse industrial working class, many of them new immigrants from Europe.
Wealthy industrialists and financiers such as John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Mellon, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Flagler, Henry Huttleston Rogers, J. P. Morgan, Leland Stanford, Meyer Guggenheim, Jacob Schiff, Charles Crocker, and Cornelius Vanderbilt would sometimes be labeled &quot;robber barons&quot; by their critics, who argue their fortunes were made at the expense of the working class, by chicanery and a betrayal of democracy. Their admirers argued that they were &quot;Captains of Industry&quot; who built the core America industrial economy and also the non-profit sector through acts of philanthropy. For instance, Andrew Carnegie donated over 90% of his wealth and said that philanthropy was their duty—the &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot;. Private money endowed thousands of colleges, hospitals, museums, academies, schools, opera houses, public libraries, and charities. John D. Rockefeller donated over $500 million to various charities, slightly over half his entire net worth. Reflecting this, many business leaders were influenced by Herbert Spencer&#x27;s theory of social Darwinism, which justified &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, competition and social stratification.

This emerging industrial economy quickly expanded to meet the new market demands. From 1869 to 1879, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 6.8% for NNP (GDP minus capital depreciation) and 4.5% for NNP per capita. The economy repeated this period of growth in the 1880s, in which the wealth of the nation grew at an annual rate of 3.8%, while the GDP was also doubled. Libertarian economist Milton Friedman states that for the 1880s, &quot;The highest decadal rate [of growth of real reproducible, tangible wealth per head from 1805 to 1950] for periods of about ten years was apparently reached in the eighties with approximately 3.8 percent.&quot;

===Wages===
The rapid expansion of industrialization led to real wage growth of 60% from 1860 to 1890, spread across the increasing labor force. Real wages (adjusting for inflation) rose steadily, with the exact percentage increase depending on the dates and the specific work force. The Census Bureau reported in 1892, that the average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48%. Economic historian Clarence D. Long estimates that (in terms of constant 1914 dollars), the average annual incomes of all American non-farm employees rose from $375 in 1870 to $395 in 1880, $519 in 1890 and $573 in 1900, a gain of 53% in 30 years.

Australian historian Peter Shergold found that the standard of living for industrial workers was higher than in Europe. He compared wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England, one of the richest industrial cities of Europe. After taking account of the cost of living (which was 65% higher in the U.S.), he found the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers in Pittsburgh had about 50% to 100% higher standard of living as those in Birmingham, England. Warren B. Catlin proposed that the natural resources and virgin lands that were available in America acted as a safety valve for poorer workers, hence, employers had to pay higher wages to hire labor. According to Shergold the American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and the perceived higher American wage led to a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America. According to historian Steve Fraser, workers generally earned less than $800 a year, which kept them mired in poverty. Workers had to put in roughly 60 hours a week to earn this much.

Wage labor was widely condemned as &#x27;wage slavery&#x27; in the working class press, and labor leaders almost always used the phrase in their speeches. As the shift towards wage labor gained momentum, working class organizations became more militant in their efforts to &quot;strike down the whole system of wages for labor.&quot; In 1886, economist and New York Mayoral candidate Henry George, author of &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, stated &quot;Chattel slavery is dead, but industrial slavery remains.&quot;

===Wealth disparity===
The unequal distribution of wealth remained high during this period. From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation&#x27;s wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it. The bottom 40% had no wealth at all. In terms of property, the wealthiest 1% owned 51%, while the bottom 44% claimed 1.1%.

Historian Howard Zinn argues that this disparity along with precarious working and living conditions for the working classes prompted the rise of populist, anarchist, and socialist movements. French economist Thomas Piketty notes that economists during this time, such as Willford I. King, were concerned that the United States was becoming increasingly inegalitarian to the point of becoming like old Europe, and &quot;further and further away from its original pioneering ideal.&quot;

According to economist Richard Sutch in an alternative view of the era, the bottom 25% owned 0.32% of the wealth while the top 0.1% owned 9.4%, which would mean the period had the lowest wealth gap in recorded history. He attributes this to the lack of government interference.

There was a significant human cost attached to this period of economic growth, as American industry had the highest rate of accidents in the world. In 1889, railroads employed 704,000 men, of whom 20,000 were injured and 1,972 were killed on the job. The U.S. was also the only industrial power to have no workman&#x27;s compensation program in place to support injured workers.

===Rise of labor unions===

Craft-oriented labor unions, such as carpenters, printers, shoemakers and cigar makers, grew steadily in the industrial cities after 1870. These unions used frequent short strikes as a method to attain control over the labor market and fight off competing unions. They generally blocked women, blacks, and Chinese from union membership, but welcomed most European immigrants.

The railroads had their own separate unions. An especially large episode of unrest (estimated at eighty thousand railroad workers and several hundred thousand other Americans, both employed and unemployed) broke out during the economic depression of the 1870s and became known as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, which was, according to historian Jack Beatty, &quot;the largest strike anywhere in the world in the 19th century.&quot; This strike did not involve labor unions, but rather uncoordinated outbursts in numerous cities. The strike and associated riots lasted 45 days and resulted in the deaths of several hundred participants (no police or soldiers were killed), several hundred more injuries, and millions in damages to railroad property. The unrest was deemed severe enough by the government that President Rutherford B. Hayes intervened with federal troops.

Starting in the mid-1880s a new group, the Knights of Labor, grew too rapidly, and it spun out of control and failed to handle the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886. The Knights avoided violence, but their reputation collapsed in the wake of the Haymarket Square Riot in Chicago in 1886, when anarchists allegedly bombed the policemen dispersing a meeting. Police then randomly fired into the crowd, killing and wounding a number of people, including other police, and arbitrarily rounded up anarchists, including leaders of the movement. Seven anarchists went on trial; four were hanged even though no evidence directly linked them to the bombing. One had in his possession a Knights of Labor membership card. At its peak, the Knights claimed 700,000 members. By 1890, membership had plummeted to fewer than 100,000, then faded away.

Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s as the gap between the rich and the poor widened. There were 37,000 strikes from 1881 to 1905. By far the largest number were in the building trades, followed far behind by coal miners. The main goal was control of working conditions and settling which rival union was in control. Most were of very short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful, because the company was losing money anyway. They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly.

The largest and most dramatic strike was the 1894 Pullman Strike, a coordinated effort to shut down the national railroad system. The strike was led by the upstart American Railway Union led by Eugene V. Debs and was not supported by the established brotherhoods. The union defied federal court orders to stop blocking the mail trains, so President Cleveland used the U.S. Army to get the trains moving again. The ARU vanished and the traditional railroad brotherhoods survived but avoided strikes.

The new American Federation of Labor, headed by Samuel Gompers, found the solution. The AFL was a coalition of unions, each based on strong local chapters; the AFL coordinated their work in cities and prevented jurisdictional battles. Gompers repudiated socialism and abandoned the violent nature of the earlier unions. The AFL worked to control the local labor market, thereby empowering its locals to obtain higher wages and more control over hiring. As a result, the AFL unions spread to most cities, reaching a peak membership in 1919.

This period saw several financial crises and economic recessions—called &quot;panics&quot;, notably the Panic of 1873 and the Panic of 1893. They lasted several years, with high urban unemployment, low incomes for farmers, low profits for business, slow overall growth, and reduced immigration. They generated political unrest.

==Politics==
Gilded Age politics, called the Third Party System, featured intense competition between two major parties, with minor parties coming and going, especially on issues of concern to prohibitionists, to labor unions and to farmers. The Democrats and Republicans (the latter nicknamed the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, GOP) fought over control of offices, which were the rewards for party activists, as well as over major economic issues. Very high voter turnout typically exceeded 80% or even 90% in some Northern states as the parties ran strong campaigns. Turnout in the South was lower. Average presidential turnout 1872 to 1900 was 83% in the North and 62% in the South.

Competition was intense and elections were very close. In the southern states, lingering resentment over the Civil War remained and meant that much of the South would vote Democratic. After the end of Reconstruction in 1877, competition in the South took place mainly inside the Democratic Party. Nationwide, turnout fell sharply after 1900.

Despite the high voter turnout, aggressive political campaigning, and frequently nasty elections, there were few real policy differences between the Democrats and Republicans. Gilded age politicians are somewhat infamous among historians for having few actual policies and doing very little of importance in office. Gilded age presidents are frequently called the &quot;forgotten presidents&quot; because of their mediocre presidencies where they did very little. 

===Metropolitan area politics===
The major metropolitan centers underwent rapid population growth and as a result had many lucrative contracts and jobs to award. To take advantage of the new economic opportunity, both parties built so-called &quot;political machines&quot; to manage elections, to reward supporters and to pay off potential opponents. Financed by the &quot;spoils system&quot;, the winning party distributed most local, state and national government jobs, and many government contracts, to its loyal supporters.

Large cities became dominated by political machines in which constituents supported a candidate in exchange for anticipated patronage. These votes would be repaid with favors back from the government once the appropriate candidate was elected; and very often candidates were selected based on their willingness to play along with the spoils system. The largest and most notorious political machine was Tammany Hall in New York City, led by Democrat Boss Tweed.
===Scandals and corruption===

Political corruption was rampant, as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate the activities of big business—and they more often than not got what they wanted. Such corruption was so commonplace that in 1868 the New York state legislature legalized such bribery. Historian Howard Zinn argues that the U.S. government was acting exactly as Karl Marx described capitalist states: &quot;pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich&quot;. Historian Mark Wahlgren Summers calls it, &quot;The Era of Good Stealings&quot; (a play on the Era of Good Feelings), noting how machine politicians used &quot;padded expenses, lucrative contracts, outright embezzlements, and illegal bond issues.&quot; He concludes:
:Corruption gave the age a distinctive flavor. It marred the planning and development of the cities, infected lobbyists dealings, and disgraced even the cleanest of the Reconstructed states. For many reasons, however, its effect on &quot;policy&quot; was less overwhelming than once imagined. Corruption influenced a few substantive decisions; it rarely determined one.

Numerous swindlers were active, especially before the Panic of 1873 exposed the falsifications and caused a wave of bankruptcies. Former President Ulysses S. Grant was the most famous victim of scoundrels and con-men, of whom he most trusted Ferdinand Ward. Grant was cheated out of all his money, although some genuine friends bought Grant&#x27;s personal assets and allowed him to keep their use.

Interpreting the phenomena, historian Allan Nevins deplored &quot;The Moral Collapse in Government and Business: 1865–1873.&quot; He argued that at war&#x27;s end society showed confusion and unsettlement as well as a hurried aggressive growth on the other. They:
:united to give birth to an alarming public and private corruption. Obviously much of the shocking improbity was due to the heavy war-time expenditures... Speculators and jobbers waxed fat on government money, the collection of federal revenues offered large opportunities for graft... Under the stimulus of greenback inflation, business ran into excesses and lost sight of elementary canons of prudence. Meanwhile, it became clear that thievery had found a better opportunity to grow because the conscience of the nation aroused against slavery, had neglected what seemed minor evils... The thousands who had rushed into speculations which they had no moral right to risk, the pushing, hardened men brought to the front by the turmoil, observed a courser, lower standard of conduct... Much of the trouble lay in the immense growth of national wealth unaccompanied by any corresponding growth in civic responsibility.

===National politics===

Major scandals reached into Congress with the Crédit Mobilier scandal of 1872, and disgraced the White House during the Grant Administration (1869–1877). This corruption divided the Republican party into two different factions: the Stalwarts led by Roscoe Conkling and the Half-Breeds led by James G. Blaine. There was a sense that government-enabled political machines intervened in the economy and that the resulting favoritism, bribery, inefficiency, waste, and corruption were having negative consequences. Accordingly, there were widespread calls for reform, such as Civil Service Reform led by the Bourbon Democrats and Republican Mugwumps. In 1884, their support elected Democrat Grover Cleveland to the White House, and in doing so gave the Democrats their first national victory since 1856.

The Bourbon Democrats supported a free market policy, with low tariffs, low taxes, less spending and, in general, a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; (hands-off) government. They argued that tariffs made most goods more expensive for the consumer and subsidized &quot;the trusts&quot; (monopolies). They also denounced imperialism and overseas expansion. By contrast, Republicans insisted that national prosperity depended on industry that paid high wages, and warned that lowering the tariff would bring disaster because goods from low-wage European factories would flood American markets.

Presidential elections between the two major parties were so closely contested that a slight nudge could tip the election in the advantage of either party, and Congress was marked by political stalemate. With support from Union veterans, businessmen, professionals, craftsmen, and larger farmers, the Republicans consistently carried the North in presidential elections. The Democrats, often led by Irish Catholics, had a base among Catholics, poorer farmers, and traditional party-members.

The nation elected a string of relatively weak presidents collectively referred to as the &quot;forgettable presidents&quot; (Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, and Harrison, with the exception of Cleveland) who served in the White House during this period. &quot;What little political vitality existed in Gilded Age America was to be found in local settings or in Congress, which overshadowed the White House for most of this period.&quot;

Overall, Republican and Democratic political platforms remained remarkably constant during the years before 1900. Both favored business interests. Republicans called for high tariffs, while Democrats wanted hard money and free trade. Regulation was rarely an issue.

===Ethnocultural politics: pietistic Republicans versus liturgical Democrats===

From 1860 to the early 20th century, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion&quot;. &quot;Rum&quot; stood for the liquor interests and the tavern keepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element. &quot;Romanism&quot; meant Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in most cities, and whom the reformers denounced for political corruption and their separate parochial school system. &quot;Rebellion&quot; harked back to the Democrats of the Confederacy, who had tried to break the Union in 1861, as well as to their northern allies, called &quot;Copperheads&quot;.

Demographic trends boosted the Democratic totals, as the German and Irish Catholic immigrants became Democrats and outnumbered the English and Scandinavian Republicans. The new immigrants who arrived after 1890 seldom voted at this time. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Republicans struggled against the Democrats&#x27; efforts, winning several close elections and losing two to Grover Cleveland (in 1884 and 1892).

Religious lines were sharply drawn. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants (especially Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Disciples of Christ) who believed in using the government to reduce social sins, such as drinking. They strongly supported the GOP, as the table shows. In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, voted for the Democrats. They saw the Democratic party as their best protection from the moralism of the pietists, and especially from the threat of prohibition. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats more bottom-heavy and the GOP better represented among businessmen and professionals in the North.

Many cultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign-language schools, became hard-fought political issues because of the deep religious divisions in the electorate. For example, in Wisconsin the Republicans tried to close down German language Catholic and Lutheran parochial schools, and were defeated in 1890 when the Bennett Law was put to the test.

Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1919 (and repealed in 1933), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.

==Immigration==

Prior to the Gilded Age, the time commonly referred to as the old immigration saw the first real boom of new arrivals to the United States. During the Gilded Age, approximately 20 million immigrants came to the United States in what is known as the new immigration. Some of them were prosperous farmers who had the cash to buy land and tools in the Plains states especially. Many were poor peasants looking for the American Dream in unskilled manual labor in mills, mines, and factories. Few immigrants went to the poverty-stricken South, though. To accommodate the heavy influx, the federal government in 1892 opened a reception center at Ellis Island near the Statue of Liberty; new arrivals needed to pass a medical inspection.

===Waves of old and new immigrants===
These European immigrants consisted of two groups: The last big waves of the &quot;Old Immigration&quot; from Germany, Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia, and the rising waves of the &quot;New Immigration&quot;, which peaked about 1910. Some men moved back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean, but most were permanent settlers. They moved into well-established communities, both urban and rural. The German American communities spoke German, but their younger generation was bilingual. The Scandinavian groups generally assimilated quickly; they were noted for their support of reform programs, such as prohibition.
In terms of immigration after 1880, the old immigration of Germans, British, Irish, and Scandinavians slackened off. The United States was producing large numbers of new unskilled jobs every year, and to fill them came immigrants from Italy, Poland, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Greece, and other points in southern and central Europe, as well as French Canada. The older immigrants by the 1870s had formed highly stable communities, especially the German Americans. The British immigrants tended to blend into the general population.

Irish Catholics had arrived in large numbers in the 1840s and 1850s in the wake of the great famine in Ireland when starvation killed millions. Their first few decades were characterized by extreme poverty, social dislocation, crime, and violence in their slums. By the late 19th century, the Irish communities had largely stabilized, with a strong new &quot;lace curtain&quot; middle class of local businessmen, professionals, and political leaders typified by P. J. Kennedy (1858–1929) in Boston. In economic terms, Irish Catholics were nearly at the bottom in the 1850s. They reached the national average by 1900, and by the late 20th century they far surpassed the national average.

In political terms, the Irish Catholics comprised a major element in the leadership of the urban Democratic machines across the country. Although they were only a third of the total Catholic population, the Irish also dominated the Catholic Church, producing most of the bishops, college presidents, and leaders of charitable organizations. The network of Catholic institutions provided high status, but low-paying lifetime careers to sisters and nuns in parochial schools, hospitals, orphanages and convents. They were part of an international Catholic network, with considerable movement back and forth from Ireland, England, France, Germany, and Canada.

====New immigrants====

The &quot;New Immigration&quot; were much poorer peasants and rural folk from southern and eastern Europe, including mostly Italians, Poles, and Jews. Some men, especially the Italians and Greeks, saw themselves as temporary migrants who planned to return to their home villages with a nest egg of cash earned in long hours of unskilled labor. Others, especially the Jews, had been driven out of Eastern Europe and had no intention of returning.

Historians analyze the causes of immigration in terms of push factors (pushing people out of the homeland) and pull factors (pulling them to America). The push factors included economic dislocation, shortages of land, and antisemitism. Pull factors were the economic opportunity of good inexpensive farmland or jobs in factories, mills and mines.

The first generation typically lived in ethnic enclaves with a common language, food, religion, and connections through the old village. The sheer numbers caused overcrowding in tenements in the larger cities. In the small mill towns, however, management usually built company housing with cheap rents.

===Chinese immigrants===
Chinese immigrants were hired by California construction companies for temporary railroad work. European Americans strongly disliked the Chinese for their alien lifestyles and the threat of low wages. The construction of the Central Pacific Railroad from California to Utah was handled largely by Chinese laborers. In the 1870 census, there were 63,000 Chinese men, with a few women in the entire U.S.; this number grew to 106,000 in 1880. Labor unions, led by Samuel Gompers strongly opposed the presence of Chinese labor. Immigrants from China were not allowed to become citizens until 1950; however, as a result of the Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;, their children born in the U.S. were full citizens.

Congress further banned Chinese immigration through the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882; the act prohibited Chinese laborers from entering the United States, but some students and businessmen were allowed in on a temporary basis. The Chinese population declined to only 37,000 in 1940. Although many returned to China (a greater proportion than most other immigrant groups), most of them stayed in the United States. Chinese people were unwelcome in urban neighborhoods, so they resettled in the &quot;Chinatown&quot; districts of large cities. The exclusion policy lasted until the 1940s.

==Rural life==
A dramatic expansion in farming took place during the Gilded Age, with the number of farms tripling from 2.0 million in 1860 to 6.0 million in 1905. The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905. The value of farms soared from $8.0 billion in 1860 to $30 billion in 1906.

The federal government issued tracts virtually free to settlers under the Homestead Act of 1862. Even larger numbers purchased lands at very low interest from the new railroads, which were trying to create markets. The railroads advertised heavily in Europe and brought over, at low fares, hundreds of thousands of farmers from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain.

Despite their remarkable progress and general prosperity, 19th century U.S. farmers experienced recurring cycles of hardship, caused primarily by falling world prices for cotton and wheat.

Along with the mechanical improvements which greatly increased yield per unit area, the amount of land under cultivation grew rapidly throughout the second half of the century, as the railroads opened up new areas of the West for settlement. The wheat farmers enjoyed abundant output and good years from 1876 to 1881 when bad European harvests kept the world price high. They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved. The farther west the settlers went, the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market, and the more inclined they were to protest, as in the Populist movement of the 1890s. Wheat farmers blamed local grain elevator owners (who purchased their crop), railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices. This protest has now been attributed to the far increased uncertainty in farming due to its commercialisation, with monopolies, the gold standard and loans being simply visualisations of this risk.

The first organized effort to address general agricultural problems was the Grange movement. Launched in 1867, by employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Granges focused initially on social activities to counter the isolation most farm families experienced. Women&#x27;s participation was actively encouraged. Spurred by the Panic of 1873, the Grange soon grew to 20,000 chapters and 1.5 million members. The Granges set up their own marketing systems, stores, processing plants, factories and cooperatives. Most went bankrupt. The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s. A few Midwestern states passed &quot;Granger Laws&quot;, limiting railroad and warehouse fees. The agricultural problems gained mass political attention in the Populist movement, which won 44 votes in the Electoral College in 1892. Its high point came in 1896 with the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for the Democrats, who was sympathetic to populist concerns such as the silver standard.

==Urban life==

American society experienced significant changes in the period following the Civil War, most notably the rapid urbanization of the North. Due to the increasing demand for unskilled workers, most European immigrants went to mill towns, mining camps, and industrial cities. New York, Philadelphia, and especially Chicago saw rapid growth. Louis Sullivan became a noted architect using steel frames to construct skyscrapers for the first time while pioneering the idea of &quot;form follows function&quot;. Chicago became the center of the skyscraper craze, starting with the ten-story Home Insurance Building in 1884–1885 by William Le Baron Jenney.

As immigration increased in cities, poverty rose as well. The poorest crowded into low-cost housing such as the Five Points and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhoods in New York. These areas were quickly overridden with notorious criminal gangs such as the Five Points Gang and the Bowery Boys. Overcrowding spread germs; the death rates in big city tenements vastly exceeded those in the countryside.

Rapid outward expansion required longer journeys to work and shopping for the middle class office workers and housewives. The working-class generally did not own automobiles until after 1945; they typically walked to nearby factories and patronized small neighborhood stores. The middle class demanded a better transportation system. Slow horse-drawn streetcars and faster electric trolleys were the rage in the 1880s.

In the horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel. However, this produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians, and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, delivery wagons, and private carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.

In small towns people mostly walked to their destination so they continued to rely on dirt and gravel into the 1920s. Larger cities had much more complex transportation needs. They wanted better streets, so they paved them with wood or granite blocks. In 1890, a third of Chicago&#x27;s 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud. Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was asphalt paving. With London and Paris as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882, and served as a model for Buffalo, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.

By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, followed by brick construction. Street-level electric trolleys moved at 12 miles per hour, and became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers. Big-city streets became paths for faster and larger and more dangerous vehicles, the pedestrians beware. In the largest cities, street railways were elevated, which increased their speed and lessened their dangers. Boston built the first subway in the 1890s followed by New York a decade later.

==The South and the West==

===The South===

The Southern United States remained heavily rural and was much poorer than the North or West. In the South, Reconstruction brought major changes in agricultural practices. The most significant of these was sharecropping, where tenant farmers &quot;shared&quot; up to half of their crop with the landowners, in exchange for seed and essential supplies. About 80% of the Black farmers and 40% of White ones lived under this system after the Civil War. Most sharecroppers were locked in a cycle of debt, from which the only hope of escape was increased planting. This led to the over-production of cotton and tobacco (and thus to declining prices and income), soil exhaustion, and poverty among both landowners and tenants.

Agriculture&#x27;s Share of the Labor Force, 1890
There were only a few scattered cities – small courthouse towns serviced the farm population. Local politics revolved around the politicians and lawyers based at the courthouse. Mill towns, narrowly focused on textile production or cigarette manufacture, began opening in the Piedmont region especially in the Carolinas. Racial segregation and outward signs of inequality were everywhere, and rarely were challenged. Black people who violated the color line were liable to expulsion or lynching. Cotton became even more important than before, as poor White people needed the cash that cotton would bring. Cotton prices were much lower than before the war, so most southerners were poor. White southerners showed a reluctance to move north, or to move to cities, so the number of small farms proliferated, and they became smaller as the population grew.

Many of the White farmers, and most of the Black farmers, were tenant farmers who owned their work animals and tools, and rented the land. Others were day laborers or very poor sharecroppers, who worked under the supervision of the landowner. There was little cash in circulation, because most farmers operated on credit accounts from local merchants, and paid off their debts at cotton harvest time in the fall. Although there were small country churches everywhere, there were only a few dilapidated elementary schools. Apart from private academies, there were very few high schools until the 1920s. Conditions were marginally better in newer areas, especially in Texas and central Florida, with the deepest poverty in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Arkansas.

The vast majority of African Americans lived in the South, and as the promises of emancipation and reconstruction faded, they entered the nadir of race relations. Every Southern state and city passed Jim Crow laws that were in effect from the late 19th century to 1964, when they were abolished by Congress. They mandated &quot;de jure&quot; (legal) segregation in all public facilities, such as stores and street cars, with a supposedly &quot;separate but equal&quot; status for Black people. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were dramatically inferior to those provided for White Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages. Schools for Black people were far fewer and poorly supported by taxpayers, although Northern philanthropies and churches kept open dozens of academies and small colleges.

In the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at Black people during Reconstruction, the federal government was unable to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen. In the Compromise of 1877 President Hayes withdrew Union troops from the South; &quot;Redeemers&quot; (White Democrats) acted quickly to reverse the groundbreaking advances of Reconstruction. Black political power was eliminated in the 1880s, and in the 1890s new laws effectively blocked over 90% of the Black people from voting (with some exceptions in Tennessee; Black people did vote in the border states).

===The West===

In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad—a combination of the Union Pacific from Omaha to Utah and the Central Pacific from Utah to California—opened up the far west mining and ranching regions. Travel from New York to San Francisco now took six days instead of six months.

After the Civil War, many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising &quot;the Best Prairie Lands&quot;, &quot;Low Prices&quot;, &quot;Large Discounts For Cash&quot;, and &quot;Better Terms Than Ever!&quot;. The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east.

Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable. The fearful stayed home, while migrants were mainly motivated by a search to improve their economic life. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. With the Homestead Act providing free land to citizens and the railroads selling cheap lands to European farmers, the settlement of the Great Plains was swiftly accomplished, and the frontier had virtually ended by 1890.

====Family life====
In the Gilded Age West, few single men attempted to operate a farm. Farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in schools.

Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and the bleakness of farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. For example, many joined a local branch of the Grange; a majority had ties to local churches. It was popular to organize activities that combined practical work, abundant food, and simple entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, and quilting bees. One could keep busy with scheduled Grange meetings, church services, and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.

Childhood on western farms is contested territory. One group of scholars argues the rural environment was salubrious because it allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. However other historians offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

====Native assimilation====

Native American policy was set by the national government (the states had very little role), and after 1865 the national policy was that Native Americans either had to assimilate into the larger community or remain on reservations, where the government provided subsidies. Reservation natives were no longer allowed to roam or fight their traditional enemies. The U.S. Army was to enforce the laws. Natives of the West came in conflict with expansion by miners, ranchers and settlers. By 1880, the buffalo herds, a foundation for the hunting economy had disappeared. Violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890.

Native Americans individually had the choice of living on reservations, with food, supplies, education and medical care provided by the federal government, or living on their own in the larger society and earning wages, typically as a cowboy on a ranch, or manual worker in town. Reformers wanted to give as many Native Americans as possible the opportunity to own and operate their own farms and ranches, so the issue was how to give individual natives land owned by the tribe. To assimilate the natives into American society, reformers set up training programs and schools, such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, that produced many prominent Native American leaders. However, anti-assimilation traditionalists on the reservations resisted integration and the resulting loss of their traditional life.

In 1887, the Dawes Act proposed to divide tribal land and parcel out 160 acres (0.65 km2) of land to each head of family. Such allotments were to be held in trust by the government for 25 years, then given to owners with full title, so they could sell it or mortgage it. As individual natives sold their land, the total held by the native community shrank by almost half. The individualized system undermined the traditional communal tribal organization. Furthermore, a majority of natives responded to intense missionary activity by converting to Christianity. The long-term goal of Dawes Act was to integrate natives into the mainstream. Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty on reservations, supported until now by Federal food, medicine and schooling. In 1934, national policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which tried to protect tribal and communal life on reservations.

==Art==

Some well-known painters of the Gilded Age include: Jules Breton, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, William Merritt Chase, John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, and Maurice Prendergast.

The New York art world took a major turn during the Gilded Age, seeing an outgrowth of exhibitions and the establishment of major auction houses with a focus on American art. The Gilded Age was pivotal in establishing the New York art world in the international art market.

==Women&#x27;s roles==

===Social activism===
During the Gilded Age, many new social movements took hold in the United States. Many women abolitionists who were disappointed that the Fifteenth Amendment did not extend voting rights to them, remained active in politics, this time focusing on issues important to them. Reviving the temperance movement from the Second Great Awakening, many women joined the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in an attempt to bring morality back to America. Its chief leader was Frances Willard (1839–1898), who had a national and international outreach from her base in Evanston, Illinois. Often the WCTU women took up the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage which had lain dormant since the Seneca Falls Convention. With leaders like Susan B. Anthony, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was formed to secure the right of women to vote.

===Employment===
Many young women worked as servants or in shops and factories until marriage, then typically became full-time housewives. However, black, Irish and Swedish adult women often worked as servants. In most large Northern cities, the Irish Catholic women dominated the market for servants. Heavy industry was a male domain, but in light industries such as textiles and food processing, large numbers of young women were hired. Thousands of young unmarried Irish and French Canadian women worked in Northeastern textile mills. Coming from poor families these jobs meant upward social mobility, more money, and more social prestige in their community that made them more attractive marriage partners. In Cohoes, New York, mill women went on strike in 1882 to gain union recognition. They fought off Swedish strike breakers to protect the status they had achieved.

After 1860, as the larger cities opened department stores, middle-class women did most of the shopping; increasingly they were served by young middle-class women clerks. Typically, most young women quit their jobs when they married. In some ethnic groups, however, married women were encouraged to work, especially among African Americans, and Irish Catholics. When the husband operated a small shop or restaurant, wives and other family members could find employment there. Widows and deserted wives often operated boarding houses.

Career women were few. The teaching profession had once been heavily male, but as schooling expanded many women took on teaching careers. If they remained unmarried they could have a prestigious but poorly paid lifetime career in the middle class. At the end of the period nursing schools opened up new opportunities for women, but medical schools remained nearly all male.

Business opportunities were rare, unless it was a matter of a widow taking over her late husband&#x27;s small business. However, the rapid acceptance of the sewing machine made housewives more productive and opened up new careers for women running their own small millinery and dressmaking shops. When her husband died, Lydia Moss Bradley (1816–1908) inherited $500,000; shrewd investments doubled that sum and she later became president of his old bank in Peoria, Illinois. She worked from home to handle banking business. In an age when philanthropists such as Johns Hopkins, Cornell, Purdue, Vanderbilt, Stanford, Rice and Duke were perpetuating their names by founding universities, she lifted her aspirations from the original idea of an orphanage to the loftier goal and in 1897 founded Bradley University in Peoria.

==Social thought==
A leading magazine, &quot;The Nation&quot;, espoused classical liberalism in every week&#x27;s issue starting in 1865, under the influential editor E. L. Godkin (1831–1902).

Science played an important part in social thought as the work of Charles Darwin became known among intellectuals. Following Darwin&#x27;s idea of natural selection, English philosopher Herbert Spencer proposed the idea of social Darwinism. This new concept justified the stratification of the wealthy and poor, and it was in this proposal that Spencer coined the term &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.

Joining Spencer was Yale professor William Graham Sumner whose book &quot;What Social Classes Owe to Each Other&quot; (1884) argued that assistance to the poor actually weakens their ability to survive in society. Sumner argued for a laissez-faire and free-market economy. Few people, however, agreed with the social Darwinists, because they ridiculed religion and denounced philanthropy.

Henry George proposed a &quot;single tax&quot; in his book &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;. The tax would be leveled on the rich and poor alike and was proposed in place of all other taxation including: sales tax, income tax, or any other form of taxation. The repeal of these other forms of taxation would result in less waste and abuse, according to George, and would make for an easy method of collecting taxes regardless of income bracket.

Economist Thorstein Veblen argued in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899) that the &quot;conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure&quot; of the wealthy had become the basis of social status in America.

In &quot;Looking Backward&quot; (1887), the reformer Edward Bellamy envisioned a future America set in the year 2000 in which a socialist paradise has been established. The works of authors such as George and Bellamy became popular, and soon clubs were created across America to discuss their ideas, although these organizations rarely made any real social change.

==Religion==
The Third Great Awakening which began before the Civil War returned and made a significant change in religious attitudes toward social progress. Followers of the new Awakening promoted the idea of the Social Gospel which gave rise to organizations such as the YMCA, the American branch of the Salvation Army, and settlement houses such as Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in Chicago in 1889.

The Third Great Awakening was a period of religious activism in American history from the late 1850s to the 20th century. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism. It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth. The Social Gospel movement gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements, Theosophy and Christian Science.

The mainline Protestant denominations (especially the Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Congregational churches) grew rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and becoming centered in towns and cities. Leaders such as Josiah Strong advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe. Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies, and made the role of missionary one of high prestige. The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the Republican Party, and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms. (See Third Party System.)

The Awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the American Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals and strengthened the Baptists, especially. After the war, Dwight L. Moody made revivalism the centerpiece of his activities in Chicago by founding the Moody Bible Institute. The hymns of Ira Sankey were especially influential.

Across the nation, &quot;drys&quot; crusaded in the name of religion for the prohibition of alcohol. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union mobilized Protestant women for social crusades against not only liquor, but also pornography and prostitution, and sparked the demand for women&#x27;s suffrage.

The Gilded Age plutocracy came under harsh attack from the Social Gospel preachers and reformers in the Progressive Era who became involved with issues of child labor, compulsory elementary education and the protection of women from exploitation in factories.

All the major denominations sponsored growing missionary activities inside the United States and around the world.

Colleges associated with churches rapidly expanded in number, size and quality of curriculum. The promotion of muscular Christianity became popular among young men on campus and in urban YMCAs, as well as such denominational youth groups such as the Epworth League for Methodists and the Walther League for Lutherans.

<text>The Banquet of Chestnuts (sometimes Ballet of Chestnuts, Festival of Chestnuts, or Joust of Whores) was a supper purportedly held at the Papal Palace in Rome and hosted by former Cardinal Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI, on 31 October 1501.

==Burchard&#x27;s account==
An account of the banquet appears in the of Johann Burchard, the Protonotary Apostolic and Master of Ceremonies. This diary, a primary source on the life of Alexander VI, was preserved in the Vatican Secret Archive; it became available to researchers in the mid-19th century when Pope Leo XIII opened the archive, although Leo expressed specific reluctance to allow general access to a document which might harm the reputation of Alexander VI.

According to Burchard, the banquet was given in Cesare Borgia&#x27;s apartments in the &quot;Palazzo Apostolico&quot;. Fifty prostitutes or courtesans were in attendance for the entertainment of the banquet guests. Burchard describes the scene as follows:
== Historicity ==

Both contemporary and modern authors have questioned the accuracy of Burchard&#x27;s account. Two independent contemporary sources confirm that a social event occurred on the date given by Burchard, but give fewer details of the festivities.

Vatican researcher Peter de Roo, in his five-volume history of Alexander VI, speculates that the passage may be a later interpolation in Burchard&#x27;s memoirs, arguing that the Pope could not be capable of such &quot;truly bestial&quot; behavior. Other historians, however, have criticized de Roo&#x27;s biography, describing it as &quot;a vast apologetic work in which much useful material is often almost undetectable under the coat of white-wash&quot; and as uncritically accepting all praise and rejecting all criticism of Alexander VI.

Alexander Lee notes that &quot;The so-called &#x27;Banquet of the Chestnuts&#x27;… is, for example, attested only in Burchard&#x27;s memoirs, and not only was intrinsically implausible, but also was dismissed as such by many contemporaries.&quot; Henry A. Brann, a Catholic priest and historian, argues that &quot;courtesans&quot; is an improper translation of a word better understood as &quot;courtiers&quot;, and that references to &quot;nudity&quot; merely describe &quot;a throwing off of the outer robes.&quot;

Defending the historicity of the account, Giles Milton argues that the is &quot;a deeply serious work&quot;, Burchard is generally a reliable source not prone to exaggerations, and that the events described are not out of character for Alexander VI, known for fathering the most illegitimate children of any pope.

==In popular culture==
William Manchester&#x27;s book &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot;, embellishes the story: &quot;Servants kept score of each man&#x27;s orgasms, for the pope greatly admired virility and measured a man&#x27;s machismo by his ejaculative capacity… After everyone was exhausted, His Holiness distributed prizes.&quot; Professional historians, however, have dismissed or ignored the book because of its numerous factual errors and its dependence on interpretations that have not been accepted by experts since the 1930s at the latest. In a review for &quot;Speculum&quot;, the journal of the Medieval Academy of America, Jeremy duQuesnay Adams remarked that Manchester&#x27;s work contained &quot;some of the most gratuitous errors of fact and eccentricities of judgment this reviewer has read (or heard) in quite some time.&quot;

The banquet is depicted in episode 4 of season 3 of the Showtime TV series &quot;The Borgias&quot;. In the show, the Banquet is shown to be a trap to blackmail otherwise disloyal members of the College of Cardinals, and is officiated by Giulia Farnese, and witnessed by Burchard who chronicles the debaucheries of the Cardinals while hidden behind a screen. None of the Borgia family are seen to be present, and loyal Cardinals such as Cardinal Farnese are warned not to accept the invitation. In the series, the event takes place in .

<doc id="485156" wikidata="Q370747" url="?curid=485156" title="Tim Russert">
<text>Timothy John Russert (May 7, 1950 – June 13, 2008) was an American television journalist and lawyer who appeared for more than 16 years as the longest-serving moderator of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. He was a senior vice president at NBC News and Washington bureau chief, and also hosted an eponymous CNBC/MSNBC weekend interview program. He was a frequent correspondent and guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;Hardball&quot;. Russert covered several presidential elections, and he presented the NBC News/&quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; survey on the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Russert in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008. Russert was posthumously revealed as a 30-year source for syndicated columnist Robert Novak.

==Early life==
Russert was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (née Seeley; January 9, 1929 – August 14, 2005), a homemaker, and Timothy Joseph &quot;Big Russ&quot; Russert (November 29, 1923 – September 24, 2009), a sanitation worker. Elizabeth and Joseph were married for 30 years, before separating in 1976. Russert was the only son and the second of four children; his sisters are Betty Ann (B.A.), Kathleen (Kathy) and Patricia (Trish). His parents were Catholics, and he had German and Irish ancestry. He received a Jesuit education from Canisius High School in Buffalo.

He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1972 from John Carroll University and a Juris Doctor with honors from the Cleveland State University College of Law in 1976. Russert commented on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that he went to Woodstock &quot;in a Buffalo Bills jersey with a case of beer.&quot; While in law school, an official from his alma mater, John Carroll University, called Russert to ask if he could book some concerts for the school as he had done while a student. He agreed, but said he would need to be paid because he was running out of money to pay for law school. One concert that Russert booked was headlined by a then-unknown singer, Bruce Springsteen, who charged $2,500 for the concert appearance. Russert told this story to Jay Leno when he was a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on NBC on June 6, 2006. John Carroll University has since named its Department of Communication and Theatre Arts in Russert&#x27;s honor.

==Professional career==

===Political===
Prior to becoming host of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Russert ran one of U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan&#x27;s five major offices, based in Buffalo, New York. He later served as special counsel and as chief of staff to Moynihan, a Democrat from Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, New York. In 1983, he became a top aide to New York Governor Mario Cuomo, also a Democrat.

===NBC News: Washington bureau chief and host of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;===
Russert joined NBC as an executive, and did not expect to appear on television. He was hired by NBC News&#x27;s Washington bureau in 1984 and became bureau chief by 1989. Russert became host of the Sunday morning program &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in 1991, and was the longest-serving host of the program. Its name was changed to &quot;Meet the Press with Tim Russert&quot;, and, at his suggestion, expanded to an hour in 1992. The show also shifted to a greater focus on in-depth interviews with high-profile guests, where Russert was known for extensive preparatory research and cross-examining style. One approach he developed was to find old quotes or video clips that were inconsistent with guests&#x27; more recent statements, present them on-air to his guests and then ask them to clarify their positions. With Russert as host the audience grew to more than four million viewers per week, and it was recognized as one of the most important sources of political news. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, and Russert often moderated political campaign debates.

==Political coverage and debates==
During NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2000 presidential election, Russert calculated possible Electoral College outcomes using a whiteboard (now in the Smithsonian Institution) on the air and memorably summed up the outcome as dependent upon &quot;Florida, Florida, Florida.&quot; TV Guide described the scene as &quot;one of the 100 greatest moments in TV history.&quot; Russert again accurately predicted the final battleground of the presidential election of 2004: &quot;Ohio, Ohio, Ohio.&quot; In the course of the debate leading up to that election, Russert used February 2004 interviews with the two candidates to home in on the paradoxical fact (and the possible consequences for democracy) of their both apparently having been members of Yale University&#x27;s Skull and Bones secret society. On the MSNBC show &quot;Tucker&quot;, Russert predicted the battleground states of the 2008 presidential election would be New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada, saying, &quot;If Democrats can win three of those four, they can lose Ohio and Florida, and win the presidency.&quot;

===Red states and blue states===
According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the phrases red states and blue states were coined by Tim Russert, although in that same article Russert states that he wasn&#x27;t the first to use the terminology. This term refers to those states of the United States of America whose residents predominantly vote for the Republican Party (red) or Democratic Party (blue) presidential candidates, respectively. John Chancellor, Russert&#x27;s NBC colleague, is credited with using red and blue to represent the states on a US map for the 1976 presidential election, but at that time Republican states were blue, and Democratic states were red. (How the colors got reversed is not entirely clear.) During the 1984 presidential election, between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale, ABC News used a map which showed Republican states as red and Democratic states as blue. According to David Brinkley, that was because Red = R = Reagan. Mainstream political discussion following the 2000 presidential election used red state/blue state more frequently.

===CIA leak scandal===
In the Plame affair, Scooter Libby, convicted chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, told special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald that Russert told him of the identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame (who is married to former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson). Russert testified previously, and again in &quot;United States v. I. Lewis Libby,&quot; that he would neither testify whether he spoke with Libby nor would he describe the conversation. Russert did say, however, that Plame&#x27;s identity as a CIA operative was not leaked to him. Russert testified again in the trial on February 7, 2007. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Russert testified that &quot;when &quot;any&quot; senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record,&quot; saying: &quot;when I talk to senior government officials on the phone, it&#x27;s my own policy our conversations are confidential. If I want to use anything from that conversation, then I will ask permission.&quot;

At the trial, the prosecution asserted that a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent had called Russert regarding Russert&#x27;s phone call with Libby, and that Russert had told the agent that the subject of Plame had not come up during his conversation with Libby. Russert was posthumously revealed as a thirty-year source of columnist Robert Novak, whose original article revealed Plame&#x27;s affiliation with the CIA. In a Slate.com article, Jack Shafer argued that &quot;the Novak-Russert relationship poses a couple of questions. [...] Russert&#x27;s long service as an anonymous source to Novak...requires further explanation.&quot; In a posthumous commentary, the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; wrote that, &quot;Like former &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Judith Miller, Russert was one of the high-level Washington journalists who came out of the Libby trial looking worse than shabby.&quot; The article&#x27;s author, Tim Rutten, argued that although Russert and NBC had claimed that these conversations were protected by journalistic privilege, &quot;it emerged under examination [that] Russert already had sung like a choirboy to the FBI concerning his conversation with Libby—and had so voluntarily from the first moment the Feds contacted him. All the litigation was for the sake of image and because the journalistic conventions required it.&quot;

===Iraq War===
In the lead-up to the Iraq War, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; featured interviews with top government officials including Vice President Dick Cheney. CBS &quot;Evening News&quot; correspondent Anthony Mason praised Russert&#x27;s interview techniques: &quot;In 2003, as the United States prepared to go to war in Iraq, Russert pressed Vice President Dick Cheney about White House assumptions.&quot; However, Salon.com reported a statement from Cheney press aide Cathie Martin regarding advice she says she offered when the Bush administration had to respond to charges that it manipulated pre-Iraq War intelligence: &quot;I suggested we put the vice president on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, which was a tactic we often used. It&#x27;s our best format.&quot; David Folkenflik quoted Russert in his May 19, 2004, &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; article:

Folkenflik went on to write:

In the 2007 PBS documentary, &quot;Buying the War&quot;, Russert commented:

===2008 presidential debate===
At the February debate, Russert was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton. Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new Russian President (Dmitry Medvedev). This was later parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers&#x27; licenses for illegal immigrants.

==Enthusiasm for sports==
Russert grew up as a New York Yankees fan, switching his allegiance to the Washington Nationals when they were established in Washington, D.C. Russert held season tickets to both the Nationals and the Washington Wizards and was elected to the board of directors of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York in 2003.

A lifelong fan of the Buffalo Bills football team, Russert often closed Sunday broadcasts during the football season with a statement of encouragement for the franchise. The team released a statement on the day of his death, saying that listening to Russert&#x27;s &quot;Go Bills&quot; exhortation was part of their Sunday morning game preparation. He once prayed publicly on the show with his father when the Bills were going for the Super Bowl for the fourth consecutive time before Super Bowl XXVIII. On July 23, 2008, U.S. Route 20A leading to the Bills&#x27; Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York was renamed the &quot;Timothy J. Russert Highway&quot;.

Russert was also a Buffalo Sabres fan and appeared on an episode of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; next to the Stanley Cup during a Sabres playoff run. While his son was attending Boston College, he often ended &quot;Meet the Press&quot; with a mention of the success of various Boston College sports teams.

Russert, then a student at the Cleveland–Marshall College of Law, attended Ten Cent Beer Night, a promotion by the Cleveland Indians which ended in a riot at the stadium. &quot;I went with $2 in my pocket,&quot; he recalled. &quot;You do the math.&quot;

==Author==
In 2004 Russert penned a best-selling autobiography, &quot;Big Russ and Me&quot;, which chronicled his life growing up in the predominantly Irish-American working-class neighborhood of South Buffalo and his education at Canisius High School. Russert&#x27;s father Timothy Joseph Russert, &quot;Big Russ&quot;, was a World War II veteran who held down two jobs after the war, emphasized the importance of maintaining strong family values, the reverence of faith, and never taking a short cut to reach a goal. Russert claimed to have received over 60,000 letters from people in response to the book, detailing their own experiences with their fathers. He released &quot;Wisdom of Our Fathers: Lessons and Letters from Daughters and Sons&quot; in 2005, a collection of some of these letters. This book also became a best-seller.

==Cameo television appearance==
Russert made a cameo appearance in 1995 on the critically acclaimed police drama, &quot;&quot;. He played the cousin of fictional Baltimore homicide detective Megan Russert. He was mentioned by name again on the show in 1996, when it was said that he had introduced his &quot;cousin&quot; to a French diplomat, with whom she then went abroad. &quot;Homicide&quot; executive producer Tom Fontana attended the same Buffalo high school as Russert.

==Awards==
During his career, Russert received 48 honorary doctorates and won several awards for excellence in journalism:
*Paul White Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association (2009), 
*John Peter Zenger Freedom of the Press Award
*American Legion Journalism Award
*Veterans of Foreign Wars News Media Award,
*Congressional Medal of Honor Society Journalism Award 
*Allen H. Neuharth Award for Excellence in Journalism 
*David Brinkley Award for Excellence in Communication
*Catholic Academy for Communication&#x27;s Gabriel Award
*2005 Emmy Award for coverage of the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan.
*2005 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Michael Bloomberg.

Minor planet 43763 Russert is named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Russert met Maureen Orth at the 1980 Democratic National Convention; they married in 1983 at the Basilica de San Miguel in Madrid, Spain. Orth has been a special correspondent for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; since 1993.

Russert delivered the 2007 Washington University in St. Louis commencement speech.

Their son, Luke, graduated from Boston College in 2008. He hosted the XM Radio show &quot;60/20 Sports&quot; with James Carville, and was an intern with ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. On July 31, 2008, NBC News announced that Luke Russert would serve as an NBC News correspondent covering the youth perspective on the 2008 United States presidential election.

The Russert family lived in northwest Washington, D.C., and also spent time at a vacation home on Nantucket Island, where Tim served on the board of several non-profit organizations. In an interview in the 2010 documentary &quot;Mister Rogers &amp; Me&quot;, he spoke of his admiration for his friend Fred Rogers, host of the iconic PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; whom he and his family met on Nantucket.

Russert, a devout Catholic, said many times he had made a promise to God to never miss Sunday Mass if his son were born healthy. In his writing and in his news reporting, Russert spoke openly and fondly of his Catholic school education and of the role of the Catholic Church in his life. He was an outspoken supporter of Catholic education on all levels. Russert said that his father, a sanitation worker who never finished high school, &quot;worked two jobs all his life so his four kids could go to Catholic school, and those schools changed my life.&quot; He also spoke warmly of the Catholic nuns who taught him. &quot;Sister Mary Lucille founded a school newspaper and appointed me editor and changed my life,&quot; he said. Teachers in Catholic schools &quot;taught me to read and write, but also how to tell right from wrong.&quot;

Russert also contributed his time to numerous Catholic charities. He was particularly devoted and concerned for the welfare of street kids in the United States and children who died from street violence. He told church workers attending the 2005 Catholic Social Ministry Gathering that &quot;if there&#x27;s an issue that Democrats, Republicans, conservatives and liberals can agree on, it&#x27;s our kids.&quot;

Russert&#x27;s favorite beer was Rolling Rock, and, at his funeral, friend and fellow anchor Tom Brokaw brought and raised a Rolling Rock in Russert&#x27;s memory.

Shortly before his death, he had an audience with Pope Benedict XVI.

==Death==
Shortly after 1:30 pm on Friday, June 13, 2008, Russert collapsed at the offices of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C., bureau of NBC News where he was chief. He was recording voiceovers for the Sunday edition of &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; In a speech he gave at the Kennedy Center, Brian Williams said that Russert&#x27;s last words were, &quot;What&#x27;s happening?&quot; spoken as a greeting to NBC Washington bureau editing supervisor Candace Harrington as he passed her in the hallway. He then walked down the hallway to record voiceovers in the soundproof booth and collapsed. A co-worker began to perform CPR on him. The District of Columbia Fire and Rescue service received a call from NBC at 1:40 pm, and dispatched an EMS unit which arrived at 1:44 pm. Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert&#x27;s heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old.

In accordance with the American journalistic standard established in the 1950s, the public announcement of Russert&#x27;s death was withheld by the wire services and his network&#x27;s competitors until Russert&#x27;s family had been notified. Retired &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Tom Brokaw then delivered, live on NBC, CNBC, and MSNBC, the breaking news of his death. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Brian Williams was on assignment in Afghanistan and could not anchor the special report. CBS and ABC also interrupted programming to report Russert&#x27;s death. Armen Keteyian reported the news for CBS and Charles Gibson reported for ABC. Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Rome, Italy, where he had celebrated his son&#x27;s graduation from Boston College. While his wife and son remained in Rome, Russert had returned to prepare for his Sunday television show.

Russert&#x27;s longtime friend and physician, Dr. Michael Newman, said that his asymptomatic coronary artery disease had been controlled with medication (LDL-C was &lt;70 mg/dL) and exercise, and that he had performed well on a stress test on April 29 of that year. An autopsy performed on the day of his death determined that his history of coronary artery disease led to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and ventricular fibrillation with the immediate cause being an occlusive coronary thrombosis in the left anterior descending artery resulting from a ruptured cholesterol plaque.

Russert is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery. The Newseum in Washington, D.C., exhibited a recreation of Russert&#x27;s office with original elements such as his desks, bookshelves, folders, loose leaf papers and notebooks. In August 2014, the exhibit was disassembled at the Newseum and transported to the Buffalo History Museum. The exhibit entitled &quot;Inside Tim Russert&#x27;s Office: If it&#x27;s Sunday It&#x27;s Meet the Press&quot;, opened in October 2014 with Luke Russert and others giving opening remarks. The exhibit can be viewed during the normal business hours of the Buffalo History Museum.

===Reaction===
On the evening of his death, the entire, nearly commercial-free half-hour of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was dedicated to Russert&#x27;s memory. Bill and Hillary Clinton released a joint statement saying Russert &quot;had a love of public service and a dedication to journalism that rightfully earned him the respect and admiration of not only his colleagues but also those of us who had the privilege to go toe to toe with him.&quot; Many of his colleagues in both newspaper and television reporting also offered tribute to Russert in this and other programs. Other major news agencies, including CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, and the BBC spent large segments of their programming on June 13 reporting about Russert&#x27;s life and career. President George W. Bush stated in a news conference with French president Nicolas Sarkozy: &quot;America lost a really fine citizen yesterday when Tim Russert passed away. I&#x27;ve had the privilege of being interviewed by Tim Russert. I found him to be a hardworking, thorough, decent man. And Tim Russert loved his country, he loved his family, and he loved his job a lot.&quot; Bruce Springsteen, a friend of Russert&#x27;s, gave an on-stage tribute to him while performing in Cardiff, Wales, on June 14 and again at Russert&#x27;s televised Kennedy Center memorial service, calling him &quot;an important irreplaceable voice in American journalism&quot; and offering condolences to his family. On the June 13, 2008, episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, O&#x27;Brien simply walked onto the stage at the start of the show. Instead of his usual upbeat antics and monologue, O&#x27;Brien announced that he had just received news about the sudden death of his good friend, fellow NBC employee and frequent &quot;Late Night&quot; guest Tim Russert. O&#x27;Brien proceeded to show two clips of his favorite Russert &quot;Late Night&quot; moments.

Some journalists criticized the amount of media coverage that Russert&#x27;s death received. Jack Shafer of &quot;Slate&quot; called NBC&#x27;s coverage a &quot;never-ending video wake.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Paul Farhi also expressed disapproval, noting that a print journalist would likely not have received similar attention. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Julia Keller questioned the volume of coverage as well as the labeling of Russert&#x27;s death as &quot;a national tragedy.&quot;

Mark Leibovich of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; wrote in his book, &quot;This Town: Two Parties and a Funeral—Plus, Plenty of Valet Parking!—in America&#x27;s Gilded Capital&quot;, about how Russert&#x27;s funeral in many ways became a spectacle of some of Washington&#x27;s worst cultural characteristics, largely centering on self-interest and posturing, while feigning remorse for the loss of the deceased. Some attendees even went as far as handing out business cards and vying for good seating. Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; dubbed the scene &quot;a new low, even for Washington tackiness&quot;.

<doc id="485158" wikidata="Q18205955" url="?curid=485158" title="Cheque clearing">
<text>Cheque clearing (or check clearing in American English) or bank clearance is the process of moving cash (or its equivalent) from the bank on which a cheque is drawn to the bank in which it was deposited, usually accompanied by the movement of the cheque to the paying bank, either in the traditional physical paper form or digitally under a cheque truncation system. This process is called the clearing cycle and normally results in a credit to the account at the bank of deposit, and an equivalent debit to the account at the bank on which it was drawn, with a corresponding adjustment of accounts of the banks themselves. If there are not enough funds in the account when the cheque arrived at the issuing bank, the cheque would be returned as a dishonoured cheque marked as non-sufficient funds.

== History ==

===England===
Cheques came into use in England in the 1600s. The person to whom the cheque was drawn (the &quot;payee&quot;) could go to the drawer&#x27;s bank (&quot;the issuing bank&quot;) and present the cheque and receive payment. Before payment, the drawer&#x27;s bank would check that the cheque was in order – e.g., that the signature was that of the drawer, that the date was valid, that the cheque was properly set out, etc. Alternatively, the payee could deposit the cheque with their own bank who would arrange for it to be presented to the issuing bank for payment.

Until around 1770 an informal exchange of cheques took place between London banks. Clerks of each bank visited all of the other banks to exchange cheques, whilst keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other. Daily cheque clearings began around 1770 when the bank clerks met at the Six Bells, a tavern in Dove Court off Lombard Street in the City of London, to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash.
The first organization for clearing cheques was the Bankers&#x27; Clearing House, established in London in the early 19th century. It was founded by Lubbock&#x27;s Bank on Lombard Street in a single room where clerks for London banks met each day to exchange cheques and settle accounts. In 1832 Charles Babbage, who was a friend of a founder of the Clearing House, published a book on mass production, &quot;The Economy of Machinery and Manufactures,&quot; in which Babbage described how the Clearing House operated:

Beginning at 5 pm, a clerk for each debtor bank was called to go to a rostrum to pay in cash to the Inspector of the Clearing House the amount their bank owed to other banks on that day. After all of the debtor clerks had paid the Inspector, each clerk for the banks that were owed money went to the rostrum to collect the money owed to their bank. The total cash paid by the debtor banks equaled the total cash collected by the creditor banks. On the rare occasions when the total paid did not equal the total collected, other clerks working for the Inspector would examine the paper trail of documents so that the numerical errors could be found and corrected.

During the Second World War, the Bankers&#x27; Clearing House was evacuated to the Trentham Estate in Staffordshire.

The clearing operation is now operated by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the United Kingdom&#x27;s clearing house.

===United States===
The Suffolk Bank opened the first clearing house in 1818 in Boston, and one was incorporated in New York in 1850. A clearing house for bankers was opened in Philadelphia in 1858.

The Americans improved on the British check clearing system and opened a bankers&#x27; clearing house, the Clearing House Association, in the Bank of New York on Wall Street, New York in 1853. Instead of the slow London procedure in which each bank clerk, one at a time, stepped up to an Inspector&#x27;s rostrum, in the New York procedure two bank clerks from each bank all worked simultaneously. One clerk from each bank sat inside a 70 foot long oval table, while the second clerk from each bank stood outside the table facing the other clerk from the same bank. Each of the outside clerks carried a file box. When the manager signalled, all of the outside clerks stepped one position to the left, to face the next seated clerks. Each clerk outside the table would then hand over the cheques drawn on the bank of the seated clerk who they were now facing, and the inside clerk, in turn, would pay the outside clerk for those cheques in cash.

Thus several such transactions could be conducted simultaneously, across the oval table. When the manager signaled again, this procedure was repeated, so that after about six minutes, the clerks had completed all their assigned transactions and were back to their starting locations, and holding exactly the amount of cash their papers said they should be holding. Clerks were fined if they made errors and the amount of the fine increased rapidly as time passed.

The Federal Reserve System check clearing system was established in the United States in 1913 to act as a central, well-capitalized clearing house. The objective was to prevent the occasional panics, where banks would refuse to accept cheques drawn on banks whose solvency was uncertain. The Federal Reserve can physically accept and transport cheques.

==Operation==
When a bank customer deposits a cheque, which may be drawn on any bank, the bank would credit the depositor&#x27;s account with the amount of the cheque. However, the amount so credited is &quot;not available&quot; to the depositor until the cheque has been cleared by the paying bank.

For cheques drawn on a customer of the same bank, the bank would, usually on the next business day, ensure that the cheque is in order and debit the account of the drawer, and the cheque would be taken to have been cleared. A cheque is not in order if, for example, the date is invalid, the drawer&#x27;s signature is not like the one held by the bank, the wrong number of signatories have signed the cheque, etc. There must also be sufficient cleared funds in the account before the drawer&#x27;s account is debited.

Cheques drawn on another bank (termed &quot;the issuing bank&quot; or &quot;paying bank&quot;) need to be &quot;presented&quot; to the other bank before the deposit bank receives payment to cover the amount credited to the depositor&#x27;s account. In the absence of the paying bank notifying the deposit bank of the &quot;special clearance&quot; of the cheque, for example, following a request from the deposit bank, the funds become available after the passing of an agreed &quot;clearance period&quot;, commonly three business days, when the depositor&#x27;s account is described as comprising &quot;cleared funds&quot;.

If the cheque is not in order, or if there are not enough cleared funds in the account when the cheque arrived at the issuing bank, the cheque would be returned as a dishonoured cheque marked appropriately, such as &quot;non-sufficient funds&quot; or &quot;present again&quot;.

All banks might have clerks to take cheques drawn on other banks to those banks, and wait for payment. Clearing houses were set up to streamline the process by collected all cheques drawn on other banks, and collecting payment from those banks for the total to be cleared.

==Automation==

===Cheque processing===
As volume grew, more efficient sorting methods were developed. Approaching the 1940s, two popular methods were Sort-A-Matic and Top Tab Key. Sort-A-Matic involved a set of metal or leather dividers numbered 00 through 99, operated to implement a form of radix sort: cheques would be sorted by hand according to the first two digits. The cheques would be removed, and each stack sorted into the same dividers by the third and fourth digits. The process was iterated until the cheques were completely sorted. Top Tab Key used a physical mechanism: holes were punched in the top of each cheque representing the values of various digits, and metal keys used to physically move them until sorted.

Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) was developed and commercialized in the 1950s, and enabled computers to reliably read routing and account numbers and automated the sorting of paper cheques.

===Electronic clearance===

Cheque truncation was introduced in various countries, starting in the 1990s, to allow electronic images to be made of physical cheques, for electronic clearance.

The legalisation of remote deposit made it possible for businesses and bank customers to deposit cheques without delivering them to their own banks. In the process, a depositor would make an image of the physical cheque with a smartphone or other device, and attach the image to a deposit. The deposit bank would use the cheque image in the normal electronic clearance process, though in this case MICR data would not be available.

===Electronic payments===
As the automation of cheque processing improved, fully electronic payment systems obviated the need for paper. Two methods were developed: the Automated Clearing House (ACH) for smaller payments which complete in two business days, and Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) for larger value same day payments.

:&quot;In 1974, ACH Associations from California, Georgia, New England and the Upper Midwest region formed NACHA within the American Bankers Association. Following that, the initial ACH rules were approved, which made Prearranged Payment and Deposit or Direct Deposit, the first ACH transaction type, effective. By 1978, it was possible for two financial institutions located anywhere in the U.S. to exchange ACH payments under a common set of rules and procedures.&quot;

:&quot;The automated clearinghouse (ACH) system is a nationwide network through which depository institutions send each other batches of electronic credit and debit transfers. The direct deposit of payroll, social security benefits, and tax refunds are typical examples of ACH credit transfers. The direct debiting of mortgages and utility bills are typical examples of ACH debit transfers. While the ACH network was originally used to process mostly recurring payments, the network is today being used extensively to process one-time debit transfers, such as converted check payments and payments made over the telephone and Internet.&quot;

&quot;CHIPS is the largest private-sector U.S.-dollar funds-transfer system in the world, clearing and settling an average of $1.5 trillion in cross-border and domestic payments daily. It combines best of two types of payments systems: the liquidity efficiency of a netting system and the intraday finality of a RTGS.&quot; Organized in 1970 by eight New York banks who were members of the Federal Reserve system, CHIPS competes with the Federal Reserve for high value payments. Until 2001, CHIPS settled at the end of the day, but now provides intraday payment finality through a real-time system.

<doc id="485162" wikidata="Q1759255" url="?curid=485162" title="O2 (brand)">
<text>O2 (typeset as O2) is a global brand name owned by the Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica. The company uses the O2 brand for its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Germany. Since 2018, it is also used as an online-only flanker brand in Spain.

Formerly, all European branches of Telefónica were managed by Telefónica Europe plc, a broadband and telecommunications company. The company originated as a collection of worldwide telecommunications companies, known in the later half of the 1990s as BT Wireless, and a global mobile data business known then as Genie Internet, both subsidiaries of British Telecommunications (British Telecom or BT). As part of a reorganisation of Telefónica in 2014, Telefónica Europe&#x27;s holdings and operations became direct subsidiaries of its parent: Telefónica S.A.

Telefónica Europe provided mobile telephony operations in the United Kingdom and Germany, and licensed its brand to former operations in the Republic of Ireland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. O2 has additionally established a joint venture with Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and in Slovakia, and the Tchibo Mobilfunk network in Germany.

==History==

===1985–2001: BT Wireless era===

====United Kingdom====

Cellnet was launched in January 1985 as a subsidiary of &quot;Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited&quot;, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications (British Telecom or BT) and Securicor respectively.

In , BT purchased Securicor&#x27;s shares in Cellnet for £3.15 billion. The company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and it became a part of &quot;BT Wireless&quot;, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT. BT invested £2 billion in BT Cellnet, and in , BT Cellnet had over 6 million customers.

In , at a general meeting held in Birmingham, 4.297 billion BT shares voted in favour of BT Cellnet&#x27;s demerger from BT, with 0.67 million shares voting against. In 2001, BT Cellnet demerged from BT as &quot;mmO2 plc&quot;, and was relaunched on 1 May 2002 using the O2 brand. The company changed its name from mmO2 to &quot;O2 plc&quot; in March 2005. In 2021 it merged with Virgin Media to form Virgin Media O2.

====Republic of Ireland====

Digifone was created in 2000, as the demerged mobile business of the prior Esat Digifone which had just been purchased by BT. Esat Digifone was originally a joint venture between Esat Telecom and Telenor. After the acquisition of Esat Telecom by BT, the Telenor share in Esat Digifone was also acquired by BT. Subsequently, the fixed operations, Esat Telecom later became BT Ireland and the demerged mobile operations, rebranded without the &quot;Esat&quot; name as Digifone, became a part of the newly formed separate company, &quot;mmO2&quot; plc. Digifone became O2 Ireland in 2001 as a subsidiary of mmO2 plc following the demerger from BT. O2 Ireland became a subsidiary of Telefónica in 2006, after its parent company O2 in the United Kingdom was purchased. In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Republic of Ireland arm of O2 for €780m. O2 was merged into Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s subsidiary Three Ireland in March 2015.

====Germany====
Viag Interkom was created in 1995 as a joint venture of the German power supply firm VIAG (45%), British BT Group (then called British Telecommunications) (45%) and Norwegian Telenor (10%) in order to compete for official licence to provide services in the rapidly liberalising German (fixed and mobile) telecommunications market at that time. In 2001 BT acquired VIAG&#x27;s share (owned by German energy company E.ON) for €11.4 billion following the German UMTS licence auction the previous year. Viag Interkom&#x27;s mobile operations were transferred into the BT Wireless family and the fixed business became BT (Germany) GmbH &amp; CO. Viag Interkom became O2 Germany as a subsidiary of mmO2 plc in 2001, following the demerger from BT.

====The Netherlands====
Telfort was created in March 1997 as a 50:50 joint venture between BT and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch national railways operator) and headquartered in Amsterdam. Telfort was awarded a licence by the government of the Netherlands to provide fixed telecommunications services in November of that year, and a mobile licence was awarded the following year. In 2000, the mobile operations of Telfort became a part of the BT Wireless family. Telfort became O2 Netherlands as a subsidiary of mmO2 plc in 2001, following the demerger from BT.

In 2003, O2 sold the company to Greenfield Capital Partners which reverted the company back to the Telfort name. Telfort eventually became a wholly owned subsidiary of KPN.

====Isle of Man====

Manx Telecom was demerged from BT as part of the mmO2 flotation in 2001. Unlike some of the company&#x27;s counterparts, the fixed and mobile arms of Manx Telecom were not split prior to the demerger, which meant that Manx Telecom was the mmO2 group&#x27;s only fixed operation at the time.

After the demerger from BT in 2001, Manx Telecom continued to trade under its brand as a subsidiary of mmO2 plc.

On 4 June 2010, Manx Telecom was sold to UK private equity investor HG Capital (who were buying the majority stake), alongside telecoms management company CPS Partners. HG Capital indicated that the enterprise value of the deal was £158.8 million ($232.5 million).

====Genie Internet and Genie Asia====

Genie Internet Ltd and Genie Asia were created as autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries of BT in 2000. By the time it became a part of the BT Wireless family of companies in 2001, Genie had mobile portal operations in the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Japan, and an Internet MVNO operation in UK called Genie Mobile. Prior to the demerger of O2 from BT, Genie scaled back its global operations in order to align with the mobile businesses demerging with it; namely UK, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. The Genie Asia business continued portal operations in Asia.

After demerging from BT in 2001, the European Genie business became the basis of a central products and services division called &#x27;Products O2&#x27; and the Genie Mobile business was rebranded to &#x27;O2 Online&#x27; which continues in the UK as a mobile communications service provider tied to the O2 UK network. The Genie portal properties were rebranded O2 Active in UK, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, and Genie Asia became O2 Asia. O2 Asia became a subsidiary of O2 UK for governance purposes.

===2001–2005: mmO2 plc era===
Following the demerger of British Telecommunications plc in 2001, mmO2 plc was created as the holding company for BT&#x27;s former mobile network assets and was split from the rest of the company, now named BT Group plc. During this period, O2 Netherlands was sold to Dutch investment group Greenfield Capital Partners in 2003. mmO2 plc was later renamed O2 plc before being taken over by Telefónica.

===2006–present: Telefónica subsidiary===
On 31 October 2005, O2 plc agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, a Spanish telecommunications company, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share. According to the merger announcement, O2 retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006.

Following the completion of the acquisition in February 2006, Telefónica undertook a corporate organisational change that saw the merging of its fixed and mobile businesses in Spain, and the transfer of Telefónica&#x27;s non-Spanish European telecommunications properties into the O2 brand. Thus, the Český Telecom and Eurotel operations in the Czech Republic as well as the Telefónica Deutschland business in Germany were brought into the governance of O2, which retained its UK registered public company status with its own board of directors and corporate governance structures and processes.

Telefónica chose to keep their existing mobile phone operations in the rest of the world under the brand Movistar. This name is used in Spain and in most Latin America countries, operated by a separate management team.

Telefónica sold its O2 Asia subsidiary in a management buyout in 2007. O2 Asia, headquartered in Singapore, operating in Far East, South Asia, Middle East, and Australasian countries, for a short time developed and marketed a range of wirelessly connected PDA and smartphone products branded Xda for both the Asian and European markets, and further such products under the &quot;MWg&quot; brand, short for Mobile &amp; Wireless Group.

In 2015 there were talks for Li Ka-shing, owner of the rival UK network Three, to buy the company. The following year, the European Commission blocked the takeover.

==Operations==

Telefónica operates its businesses under the O2 brand through its subsidiaries Telefónica UK and Telefónica Germany. Telefónica Spain uses Movistar as its flagship brand, while O2 is a secondary low-cost brand.

Telefónica owns the Giffgaff MVNO in the United Kingdom, which uses the O2 network.

In May 2020, it was reported that Telefónica and Liberty Global plan to merge the UK operations of O2 with Virgin Media, a pay-TV and broadband provider in that country, owned by Liberty Global.

==Former operations==

===Ireland===

Telefónica Ireland was providing broadband and telecommunications in Ireland under the O2 brand. O2 Ireland was previously called Esat Digifone when it was owned by Esat Telecommunications (and Telenor) from 1997 to 2006. O2 Ireland became part of Telefónica in 2006 as part of its purchase of O2 in the UK.

In June 2013, Hutchison Whampoa announced it would acquire the Irish arm of O2 for €780m. In March 2015, the company was merged into Hutchison Whampoa&#x27;s subsidiary Three Ireland.

===Czech Republic===

Český Telecom was the new name given to a company previously known as SPT Telecom which was formed from the splitting off of the Czech Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications into postal and telecom sides in 1993. The company was renamed to Český Telecom in 2000 and remained a government-controlled company until its complete privatisation in 2004. Along the way, rapid modernisation of the network occurred with the help of funding and expertise of the Dutch and Swiss consortium called TelSource.

In parallel to the evolution of Český Telecom, the Eurotel mobile phone business was established in 1990 in a joint venture between what was then known as the Czechoslovak telecom ministry, Bell Atlantic and US West. In 1996, GSM services were introduced, and in 2003 Český Telecom acquired full control of Eurotel.

The Czech Republic government sold its remaining stake in Český Telecom (along with its Eurotel subsidiary) to Telefónica in 2005 which renamed it to Telefónica O2 Czech Republic and since 2006 started to use the O2 brand for both fixed and mobile services. In 2011 company was renamed to Telefónica Czech Republic.

In 2013 was announced that Telefónica would sell its stake in the company to PPF. Under the terms of the sale, the company would continue to use the O2 brand for a maximum of four years. The agreement was later extended, and the company continues under the O2 brand as of January 2024.

===Slovakia===

In 2002 Český Telecom founded Czech Telecom Slovakia, its subsidiary in Slovakia. The company was providing services for large corporations only. In 2006 the company was renamed Telefónica O2 Slovakia and won a tender for the 3rd mobile phone operator in Slovakia. On 2 February 2007, Telefónica O2 Slovakia started providing services in Slovakia for first customers &quot;O2 Jednotky&quot;. On 28 February O2 launched classic services and opened first shop in Slovakia (in Bratislava on Obchodná street). In 2013 it was announced that it would be sold with its parent company to PPF.

==Marketing==

===Branding===
The BT Cellnet consumer brand was renamed O2 – the chemical symbol for unbound oxygen – as were all the group&#x27;s other businesses (other than Manx Telecom). The re-branding was designed by the Lambie-Nairn design agency, which developed the idea of the company supplying services that were essential, much the same as oxygen is essential for life. With this, the company logo and associated graphics were designed, using air bubbles to present this.

===Sponsorship===

O2 currently sponsor the England rugby team, and in 2003 launched a mobile video service allowing customers to download or stream video content related to the 2003 Rugby World Cup. In 2005, Telefónica O2 extended their involvement in rugby union, signing a new deal with the England rugby team and the Rugby Football Union, as well as O2 rugbyclass and Premier Rugby Ltd for the English Premiership.

Telefónica O2 also had a long-standing relationship with Arsenal F.C., being their shirt sponsor from 2002 to 2006. In 2005, a three-year deal was signed that saw Telefónica O2 become the team&#x27;s exclusive Mobile Communications Partner.

From 2005 to 2008, O2 sponsored the Wireless Festival, a music festival held annually in London (and near Leeds in 2006 and 2007).

Telefónica O2 was the sponsor of the Cork GAA Football and Hurling teams and the Irish rugby team. The partnership with Irish rugby went interactive in 2006, when Ireland fans were offered access to daily updates from head coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan. In 2009, O2 launched their &#x27;BeTheDifference&#x27; integrated advertising campaign where fans had the chance to have their names included on the O2 Rugby posters and on the Irish Rugby players&#x27; jerseys. The integrated campaign was created by O2&#x27;s two Irish advertising agencies: McConnells (above-the-line) and Brando (below-the-line). The interactive campaign won an award at the 2009 Kinsale Sharks.

===Naming rights===
On 31 May 2005, Telefónica O2 acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Millennium Dome in London from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). The Dome is therefore now officially known as &#x27;The O2&#x27;. The company extended their relationship with music venues in 2008 when all Academy Music venues became known as &#x27;O2 Academies&#x27;, replacing Carling as venue sponsors.

For short time, the naming rights arrangements with AEG also apply in Germany, with large sport and concert venues known as O2 World in Berlin and Hamburg.

<doc id="485168" wikidata="Q1077741" url="?curid=485168" title="Hairy ball theorem">
<text>The hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology (sometimes called the hedgehog theorem in Europe) states that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional &quot;n&quot;-spheres. For the ordinary sphere, or 2‑sphere, if &quot;f&quot; is a continuous function that assigns a vector in to every point &quot;p&quot; on a sphere such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is always tangent to the sphere at &quot;p&quot;, then there is at least one pole, a point where the field vanishes (a &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = [[Null vector|0]]).

The theorem was first proved by Henri Poincaré for the 2-sphere in 1885, and extended to higher even dimensions in 1912 by Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer.

The theorem has been expressed colloquially as &quot;you can&#x27;t comb a hairy ball flat without creating a cowlick&quot; or &quot;you can&#x27;t comb the hair on a coconut&quot;.

==Counting zeros==
Every zero of a vector field has a (non-zero) &quot;index&quot;, and it can be shown that the sum of all of the indices at all of the zeros must be two, because the Euler characteristic of the 2-sphere is two. Therefore, there must be at least one zero. This is a consequence of the Poincaré–Hopf theorem. In the case of the torus, the Euler characteristic is 0; and it is possible to &quot;comb a hairy doughnut flat&quot;. In this regard, it follows that for any compact regular 2-dimensional manifold with non-zero Euler characteristic, any continuous tangent vector field has at least one zero.

==Application to computer graphics==
A common problem in computer graphics is to generate a non-zero vector in that is orthogonal to a given non-zero vector. There is no single continuous function that can do this for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of the hairy ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector orthogonal to the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent to the surface of that sphere where it touches the radius. However, the hairy ball theorem says there exists no continuous function that can do this for every point on the sphere (equivalently, for every given vector).

==Lefschetz connection==
There is a closely related argument from algebraic topology, using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. Since the Betti numbers of a 2-sphere are 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ... the &quot;Lefschetz number&quot; (total trace on homology) of the identity mapping is 2. By integrating a vector field we get (at least a small part of) a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms on the sphere; and all of the mappings in it are homotopic to the identity. Therefore, they all have Lefschetz number 2, also. Hence they have fixed points (since the Lefschetz number is nonzero). Some more work would be needed to show that this implies there must actually be a zero of the vector field. It does suggest the correct statement of the more general Poincaré-Hopf index theorem.

==Corollary==
A consequence of the hairy ball theorem is that any continuous function that maps an even-dimensional sphere into itself has either a fixed point or a point that maps onto its own antipodal point. This can be seen by transforming the function into a tangential vector field as follows.

Let &quot;s&quot; be the function mapping the sphere to itself, and let &quot;v&quot; be the tangential vector function to be constructed. For each point &quot;p&quot;, construct the stereographic projection of &quot;s&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) with &quot;p&quot; as the point of tangency. Then &quot;v&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is the displacement vector of this projected point relative to &quot;p&quot;. According to the hairy ball theorem, there is a &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;v&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = 0, so that &quot;s&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;.

This argument breaks down only if there exists a point &quot;p&quot; for which &quot;s&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is the antipodal point of &quot;p&quot;, since such a point is the only one that cannot be stereographically projected onto the tangent plane of &quot;p&quot;.

A further corollary is that any even-dimensional projective space has the fixed-point property. This follows from the previous result by lifting continuous functions of formula_1 into itself to functions of formula_2 into itself.

==Higher dimensions==
The connection with the Euler characteristic χ suggests the correct generalisation: the 2&quot;n&quot;-sphere has no non-vanishing vector field for . The difference between even and odd dimensions is that, because the only nonzero Betti numbers of the &quot;m&quot;-sphere are b0 and bm, their alternating sum χ is 2 for &quot;m&quot; even, and 0 for &quot;m&quot; odd.

Indeed it is easy to see that an odd-dimensional sphere admits a non-vanishing tangent vector field through a simple process of considering coordinates of the ambient even-dimensional Euclidean space formula_3 in pairs. Namely, one may define a tangent vector field to formula_4 by specifying a vector field formula_5 given by
:formula_6
In order for this vector field to restrict to a tangent vector field to the unit sphere formula_7 it is enough to verify that the dot product with a unit vector of the form formula_8 satisfying formula_9 vanishes. Due to the pairing of coordinates, one sees
:formula_10
For a 2&quot;n&quot;-sphere, the ambient Euclidean space is formula_11 which is odd-dimensional, and so this simple process of pairing coordinates is not possible. Whilst this does not preclude the possibility that there may still exist a tangent vector field to the even-dimensional sphere which does not vanish, the hairy ball theorem demonstrates that in fact there is no way of constructing such a vector field.

==Physical exemplifications==
The hairy ball theorem has numerous physical exemplifications. For example, rotation of a rigid ball around its fixed axis gives rise to a continuous tangential vector field of velocities of the points located on its surface. This field has two zero-velocity points, which disappear after drilling the ball completely through its center, thereby converting the ball into the topological equivalent of a torus, a body to which the “hairy ball” theorem does not apply. The hairy ball theorem may be successfully applied for the analysis of the propagation of electromagnetic waves, in the case when the wave-front forms a surface, topologically equivalent to a sphere (the surface possessing the Euler characteristic χ = 2). At least one point on the surface at which vectors of electric and magnetic fields equal zero will necessarily appear. On certain 2-spheres of parameter space for electromagnetic waves in plasmas (or other complex media), these type of &quot;cowlicks&quot; or &quot;bald points&quot; also appear, which indicates that there exists topological excitation, i.e., robust waves that are immune to scattering and reflections, in the systems.
If one idealizes the wind in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as a tangent-vector field, then the hairy ball theorem implies that given any wind at all on the surface of the Earth, there must at all times be a cyclone somewhere. Note, however, that wind can move vertically in the atmosphere, so the idealized case is not meteorologically sound. (What &quot;is&quot; true is that for every &quot;shell&quot; of atmosphere around the Earth, there must be a point on the shell where the wind is not moving horizontally.) The theorem also has implications in computer modeling (including video game design), in which a common problem is to compute a non-zero 3-D vector that is orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular) to a given one; the hairy ball theorem implies that there is no single continuous function that accomplishes this task.

<doc id="485171" wikidata="Q1419745" url="?curid=485171" title="Gambino crime family">
<text>The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is an Italian-American Mafia crime family and one of the &quot;Five Families&quot; that dominate organized crime activities in New York City, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the American Mafia. The group, which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group&#x27;s operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, and fencing.

The family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931. For most of the next quarter-century, it was a minor player in organized crime. Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia, who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld&#x27;s enforcement arm, Murder, Inc. He remained in power even after Murder, Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s, and took over his family in 1951—by all accounts, after murdering the family&#x27;s founder Vincent Mangano—which was then recognized as the Anastasia crime family.

The rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957, when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan, New York City. Some historians believe that Albert Anastasia&#x27;s underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family. Gambino partnered with Meyer Lansky to control gambling interests in Cuba and a few other places. The family&#x27;s fortunes grew through 1976, when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law Paul Castellano as boss upon his death. Castellano infuriated upstart capo John Gotti, who orchestrated Castellano&#x27;s murder in 1985. Gotti&#x27;s downfall came in 1992, when his underboss Salvatore &quot;Sammy the Bull&quot; Gravano cooperated with the FBI. Gravano&#x27;s cooperation with the U.S. government sent John Gotti and most of the top members of the Gambino family to prison. Following the Gotti regime, the control of the Gambino family was assumed by the organization&#x27;s Sicilian faction. Beginning in 2015, the family was headed by Frank Cali until his assassination outside his Staten Island home on March 13, 2019.

==History==

===Origins===

====D&#x27;Aquila gang====

The origins of the Gambino crime family can be traced back to the faction of newly transplanted mafiosi from Palermo, Sicily who were originally led by Ignazio Lupo. When he and his partner by business and marriage, Giuseppe Morello, were sent to prison for counterfeiting in 1910, Salvatore &quot;Toto&quot; D&#x27;Aquila, one of Lupo&#x27;s chief captains, took over. D&#x27;Aquila was an influential emigrant from Palermo who joined the Lupo gang based in East Harlem. Founded in the 1900s, the Lupo &quot;Mano Nera&quot; gang was one of the first Italian criminal groups in New York. Lupo was partner in many ventures with Morello, who was the original &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (boss of bosses), a title that would later be coveted by D&#x27;Aquila. As other gangs formed in New York, they acknowledged Morello as their boss of bosses. In 1906, D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s name first appeared on police records for running a confidence scam.

In 1910, Giuseppe Morello and Ignazio Lupo were sentenced to 30 years in prison for counterfeiting. With the Morello family weakened, D&#x27;Aquila used the opportunity to establish the dominance of what was now his own Palermitani family in East Harlem. D&#x27;Aquila quickly used his ties to other Mafia leaders in the United States to create a network of influence and connections and was soon a powerful force in New York.

====New York gangs====
By 1910, more Italian gangs had formed in New York City. In addition to the original Morello gang in East Harlem and D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s own, now growing gang, also in East Harlem (but expanding into Little Italy in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side), there were other organizations forming. In Brooklyn, Nicolo &quot;Cola&quot; Schirò established a second gang of Sicilian mafiosi from Castellammare del Golfo, west of Palermo, in Sicily. A third Sicilian gang was formed by Alfred Mineo in Brooklyn. Another Morello captain, Gaetano Reina, had also broken away in the Bronx, ruling that area with impunity. In south Brooklyn, first Johnny Torrio, then Frankie Yale were leading a new and rising organization. Finally, there were two allied Neapolitan Camorra gangs, one on Coney Island and one on Navy Street in Brooklyn, that were run by Pellegrino Morano and Alessandro Vollero.

In 1916 the Camorra had assassinated Nicholas Morello, head of the Morello gang. In response, D&#x27;Aquila allied with the Morellos to fight the Camorra. In 1917, both Morano and Vollero were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. With their leadership gone, the two Camorra gangs disappeared and D&#x27;Aquila and the Schiro family in Brooklyn took over many of their rackets in Brooklyn. Soon after, D&#x27;Aquila absorbed the Mineo gang, making Mineo his first lieutenant. D&#x27;Aquila now controlled the largest and most influential Italian gang in New York City. It was about this time that Joe Masseria, another former Morello captain, began asserting his influence over the Lower East Side&#x27;s Little Italy and began to come into conflict with D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s operations there, as Prohibition approached.

====Prohibition====
In 1920, the United States outlawed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages (Prohibition), creating the opportunity for an extremely lucrative illegal racket for the New York gangs.

By 1920, D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s only significant rival was Giuseppe &quot;Joe the Boss&quot; Masseria. Masseria had taken over the Morello family interests, and by the mid-1920s, had begun to amass power and influence to rival that of D&#x27;Aquila. By the late 1920s, D&#x27;Aquila and Masseria were headed for a showdown.

On October 10, 1928, Masseria gunmen assassinated Salvatore D&#x27;Aquila outside his home. D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s second-in-command, Alfred Mineo, and his right-hand man, Steve Ferrigno, now commanded the largest and most influential Sicilian gang in New York City.

====Castellammarese War====
In 1930, the Castellammarese War started between Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano, the new leader of Cola Schirò&#x27;s Castellammarese gang, for control of Italian-American organized crime in New York. Mineo was a casualty; he and Ferrigno were shot dead during an assassination attempt on Masseria on November 5, 1930. In April 1931, Masseria was murdered in a restaurant by several of his gang members who had defected to Maranzano. Maranzano declared himself the boss of all bosses and reorganized all the New York gangs into five crime families. Maranzano appointed Frank Scalice as head of the old D&#x27;Aquila/Mineo gang, now designated as one of New York&#x27;s new five families.

In September 1931, Maranzano was himself assassinated in his office by a squad of contract killers. The main beneficiary (and organizer of both hits) was Charlie &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. Luciano kept Maranzano&#x27;s five families and added a Commission to mediate disputes and prevent more gang warfare.

Also in 1931, Luciano replaced Scalice with Vincent Mangano as head of the D&#x27;Aquila/Mineo gang, now the Mangano crime family. Mangano also received a seat on the new Commission. The modern era of the Cosa Nostra had begun.

===Mangano era===
Vincent Mangano now took over the family, with Joseph Biondo as consigliere and Albert Anastasia as underboss. Vincent Mangano still believed in the Old World mob traditions of &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot;. However, he was somewhat more forward-looking than either Masseria or Maranzano. To compensate for loss of massive revenues with the end of Prohibition in 1933, Vincent Mangano moved his family into extortion, union racketeering, and illegal gambling operations including horse betting, running numbers and lotteries.

Vincent Mangano also established the City Democratic Club, ostensibly to promote American values. In reality, the club was a cover for Murder, Inc., the notorious band of mainly Jewish hitmen who performed contract murders for the Cosa Nostra nationwide. Anastasia was the operating head of Murder, Inc.; he was popularly known as the &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot;.

Vincent Mangano also had close ties with Emil Camarda, a vice-president of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association (ILA). Through the ILA, Mangano and the family completely controlled the Manhattan and Brooklyn waterfronts. From 1932 onward, the president of ILA Local 1814 was Anthony &quot;Tough Tony&quot; Anastasio, Albert Anastasia&#x27;s younger brother (Anthony kept the original spelling of their last name). Anastasio was one of the family&#x27;s biggest earners, steering millions of dollars in kickbacks and payoffs into the family&#x27;s coffers. Anastasio made no secret of his ties to the mob; he only had to say &quot;my brother Albert&quot; to get his point across. With the family&#x27;s backing, the Brooklyn waterfront was Anastasio&#x27;s bailiwick for 30 years.

Around this time, Carlo Gambino was promoted within the Mangano family, along with another future boss, Gambino&#x27;s cousin Paul Castellano.

Anastasia and Mangano were usually in conflict, even though they worked together for 20 years. On numerous occasions, Anastasia and Vincent Mangano came close to physical conflict. Vincent Mangano felt uncomfortable with Anastasia&#x27;s close ties to Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Joseph Bonanno and other top mobsters outside his family. Mangano was also jealous of Anastasia&#x27;s strong power base in Murder Inc. and the waterfront unions.

In April 1951, Vincent Mangano disappeared without a trace, while his brother Phillip was found dead. No one was ever charged in the Mangano brothers&#x27; deaths and Vincent&#x27;s body was never found. However, it is generally believed that Anastasia murdered both of them.

===Anastasia regime===
Called to face the Commission, Anastasia refused to accept guilt for the Mangano murders. However, Anastasia did claim that Vincent Mangano had been planning to kill him. Anastasia was already running the family in Vincent Mangano&#x27;s &quot;absence&quot; and the Commission members were intimidated by Anastasia. With the support of Frank Costello, boss of the Luciano crime family, the Commission confirmed Anastasia&#x27;s ascension as boss of what was now the Anastasia crime family. Carlo Gambino, a wily character with designs on the leadership himself, maneuvered himself into the position of consigliere.

The former boss of Murder, Inc., Anastasia was a vicious murderer who inspired fear throughout the New York families. With Costello as an ally, Anastasia came to control the Commission. Costello&#x27;s bitter rival was Vito Genovese, a former underboss for Lucky Luciano. Since 1946, Genovese had been scheming to remove Costello from power but was not powerful enough to face Anastasia.

====Plot against Anastasia====
Anastasia&#x27;s own brutal actions soon created a favorable climate in New York for his removal. In 1952, Anastasia ordered the murder of a Brooklyn man, Arnold Schuster, who had aided in the capture of the bank robber Willie Sutton. Anastasia did not like the fact that Schuster had helped the police. The New York families were outraged by this gratuitous killing that raised a large amount of public furor. Anastasia also alienated one of Luciano&#x27;s powerful associates, Meyer Lansky, by opening casinos in Cuba to compete with Lansky&#x27;s. Genovese and Lansky soon recruited Carlo Gambino to the conspiracy by offering him the chance to replace Anastasia and become boss himself.

In May 1957, Frank Costello escaped a Genovese-organized murder attempt with a minor injury and decided to resign as boss. However, Genovese and Gambino soon learned that Costello was conspiring with Anastasia to regain power. They decided to kill Anastasia.

On October 25, 1957, several masked gunmen murdered Anastasia in the barbershop at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. As Anastasia sat in the barber&#x27;s chair, the three assailants rushed in, shoved the barber out of the way, and started shooting. The wounded Anastasia allegedly lunged at his killers, but only hit their reflections in the wall mirror. Anastasia died at the scene. Many historians believe that Gambino ordered caporegime Joseph Biondo to kill Anastasia and Biondo gave the contract to a squad of Gambino drug dealers led by Stephen Armone and Stephen Grammauta.

===Gambino era===

With Anastasia&#x27;s death, Carlo Gambino became boss of what was now called the Gambino crime family. Joseph Biondo was appointed underboss; he was, by 1965, replaced by Aniello Dellacroce.

Gambino and Luciano then allegedly provided a part of the $100,000 paid to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. In April 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, where he died in 1969.

Gambino quickly built the family into the most powerful crime family in the United States. He was helped by Meyer Lansky&#x27;s offshore gaming houses in Cuba and the Bahamas, a lucrative business for the Cosa Nostra.

====Control of other crime families====
In 1964, Joseph &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, and Joseph Magliocco, the new boss of the Profaci crime family, conspired to kill Gambino and his allies on the Commission. However, the man entrusted with the job, Joseph Colombo, instead revealed the plot to Gambino. The Commission, led by Gambino, forced Magliocco to resign and hand over his family to Colombo, while Bonanno fled New York. Gambino then became the most powerful leader of the &quot;Five Families&quot;.

In 1971, Gambino allegedly used his power to orchestrate the shooting of Colombo. Gambino and his allies were unhappy about Colombo&#x27;s high public profile. Jerome Johnson shot Colombo on June 28, 1971 at the second &quot;Italian-American Unity Day&quot; rally; Johnson was then shot and killed on the spot by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards. Johnson was tentatively linked to the Gambino family, but no one else was charged in the shooting. Colombo survived the shooting, but remained paralyzed until his death in 1978.

Gambino&#x27;s influence also stretched into behind-the-scenes control of the Lucchese crime family, led by Carmine &quot;Mr. Gribbs&quot; Tramunti.

In 1972, Gambino allegedly picked Frank &quot;Funzi&quot; Tieri to be front boss of the Genovese crime family. Gambino had allegedly ordered the murder of Tieri&#x27;s predecessor Thomas Eboli after Eboli failed to repay a $3 million loan to Gambino. Others believe that Eboli was killed by his own crime family for his erratic ways.

Under Gambino, the family gained particularly strong influence in the construction industry. It acquired behind-the-scenes control of Teamsters Local 282, which controlled access to most building materials in the New York City area and could literally bring most construction jobs in New York City to a halt.

On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino died at home of natural causes. Against expectations, he had appointed Castellano to succeed him over his underboss Dellacroce. Gambino appeared to believe that his crime family would benefit from Castellano&#x27;s focus on white collar businesses. Dellacroce, at the time, was imprisoned for tax evasion and was unable to contest Castellano&#x27;s succession.

Castellano&#x27;s succession was confirmed at a meeting on November 24, with Dellacroce present. Castellano arranged for Dellacroce to remain as underboss while directly running traditional Cosa Nostra activities such as extortion, robbery, and loansharking. While Dellacroce accepted Castellano&#x27;s succession, the deal effectively split the Gambino family into two rival factions.

===Castellano regime===

When Castellano became boss, he negotiated a division of responsibilities between himself and Dellacroce. Castellano took control of the so-called &quot;white collar crimes&quot; that included stock embezzlement and other big money rackets. Dellacroce retained control of the traditional Cosa Nostra activities. To maintain control over the Dellacroce faction, Castellano relied on the crew run by Anthony &quot;Nino&quot; Gaggi and Roy DeMeo. The DeMeo crew allegedly committed between 74 and 200 murders during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

As Castellano became more powerful in the Gambino family, he started to make large amounts of money from construction concrete. Castellano&#x27;s son Philip was the president of Scara-Mix Concrete Corporation, which exercised a near monopoly on Staten Island on construction concrete. Castellano also handled the Gambino interests in the &quot;Concrete Club&quot;, a club of contractors selected by The Commission to handle contracts between $2 million and $15 million. In return, the contractors gave a two percent kickback of the contract value to The Commission. Castellano also supervised Gambino control of Teamsters Union Local Chapter 282, which provided workers to pour concrete at all major building projects in New York and Long Island.

====Gambino family case====
In response to the rise of the Gambino family, federal prosecutors targeted the family leadership. On March 31, 1984 a federal grand jury indicted Castellano and 20 other Gambino members and associates with charges of drug trafficking, murder, theft, and prostitution. The following year, he received a second indictment for his role in the Mafia&#x27;s Commission. Facing life imprisonment for either case, Castellano arranged for Gotti to serve as an acting boss alongside Thomas Bilotti, Castellano&#x27;s favorite &quot;capo&quot;, and Thomas Gambino in his absence.

====Conflict with Gotti====
Castellano&#x27;s most vocal critic was John Gotti, a Queens-based capo and Dellacroce&#x27;s protégé. Gotti was ambitious and wanted to be boss himself. Gotti rapidly became dissatisfied with Castellano&#x27;s leadership, regarding the new boss as being too isolated and greedy. Like other members of the family, Gotti also personally disliked Castellano. The boss lacked street credibility, and those who had paid their dues running street level jobs did not respect him. Gotti also had an economic interest: he had a running dispute with Castellano on the split Gotti took from hijackings at Kennedy Airport. Gotti was also rumored to be expanding into drug dealing, a lucrative trade Castellano had banned.

In August 1983, Ruggiero and Gene Gotti were arrested for dealing heroin, based primarily on recordings from a bug in Ruggiero&#x27;s house. Castellano, who had banned made men from his family from dealing drugs under threat of death, demanded transcripts of the tapes, and, when Ruggiero refused, threatened to demote Gotti.

Gotti began conspiring with fellow disgruntled &quot;capos&quot; Frank DeCicco and Joseph &quot;Joe Piney&quot; Armone and soldiers Sammy Gravano and Robert &quot;DiB&quot; DiBernardo (collectively dubbed &quot;the Fist&quot; by themselves) to overthrow Castellano, insisting, despite the boss&#x27; inaction, that Castellano would eventually try to kill him. Armone&#x27;s support was critical; as a respected old-timer who dated back to the family&#x27;s founder, Vincent Mangano, he would lend needed credibility to the conspirators&#x27; cause.

It has long been a rule in the Mafia that killing a boss is forbidden without the support of a majority of the Commission. Indeed, Gotti&#x27;s planned hit would have been the first attack on a boss since Albert Anastasia was killed in 1957. Gotti knew that it would be too risky to solicit support from the other four bosses, since they had longstanding ties to Castellano. To get around this, he got the support of several important figures of his generation in the Lucchese, Colombo and Bonanno families. He did not consider approaching the Genovese family, as Castellano had close ties with Genovese boss Vincent &quot;Chin&quot; Gigante. However, Gotti could also count on the complicity of Gambino &quot;consigliere&quot; Joseph N. Gallo.

After Dellacroce died of cancer on December 2, 1985, Castellano revised his succession plan: appointing Bilotti as underboss to Thomas Gambino as the sole acting boss, while making plans to break up Gotti&#x27;s crew. Infuriated by this, and Castellano&#x27;s refusal to attend Dellacroce&#x27;s wake, Gotti resolved to kill his boss.

On December 16, 1985, Bilotti and Castellano arrived at Sparks Steak House in Manhattan for a dinner meeting with capo Frank DeCicco. DeCicco had tipped off Gotti that he would be meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at Sparks that evening. As Bilotti and Castellano were exiting their car, four unidentified men under Gotti&#x27;s command shot them to death. Gotti watched the hit from his car with Gravano.

===John Gotti===

Several days after the Castellano murder, Gotti was named to a three-man committee, along with Gallo and DeCicco, to temporarily run the family pending the election of a new boss. It was also announced that an internal investigation into Castellano&#x27;s murder was underway. However, it was an open secret that Gotti was acting boss in all but name, and nearly all of the family&#x27;s &quot;capos&quot; knew he had been the one behind the hit. He was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the Gambino family at a meeting of 20 &quot;capos&quot; held on January 15, 1986.

Gotti appointed Frank DeCicco as underboss and promoted Angelo Ruggiero and Sammy Gravano to capo. At the time of his takeover, the Gambino family was regarded as the most powerful American mafia family, with an annual income of $500 million.

Gotti was known as &quot;The Dapper Don&quot;, renowned for his hand-tailored suits and silk ties. Unlike his colleagues, Gotti made little effort to hide his mob connections and was very willing to provide interesting sound bites to the media. His home in Howard Beach, Queens was frequently seen on television. He liked to hold meetings with family members while walking in public places so that law enforcement agents could not record the conversations. One of Gotti&#x27;s neighbors in Howard Beach was Joseph Massino, underboss of the Bonanno crime family. Gotti and Massino had a longstanding friendship dating back to the 1970s when they were known as two of the most proficient truck hijackers in New York.

Mob leaders from the other families were enraged at the Castellano murder and disapproved of Gotti&#x27;s high-profile style. Gotti&#x27;s strongest enemy was Genovese crime family boss Vincent &quot;Chin&quot; Gigante, a former Castellano ally. Gigante conspired with Lucchese boss Anthony &quot;Tony Ducks&quot; Corallo to have Gotti killed. Corallo gave the contract to two top members of his family, Vittorio &quot;Vic&quot; Amuso and Anthony &quot;Gaspipe&quot; Casso.

Gotti&#x27;s newfound fame had at least one positive effect for Gotti; upon the revelation of his attacker&#x27;s occupation, and amid reports of intimidation by the Gambinos, Romual Piecyk decided not to testify against Gotti thanks to Boško &quot;The Yugo&quot; Radonjić, the head of the Westies in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan. When the trial began in March 1986, Piecyk testified he was unable to remember who attacked him. The case was promptly dismissed, with the &quot;New York Post&quot; summarizing the proceedings with the headline &quot;I Forgotti!&quot; It was later revealed that Gambino thugs had severed Piecyk&#x27;s brake lines, made threatening phone calls, and stalked him before the trial.

On April 13, 1986, DeCicco was killed when his car was bombed following a visit to Castellano loyalist James Failla. The bombing was carried out by Victor Amuso and Anthony Casso of the Lucchese family, under orders of Gigante and Lucchese boss Anthony Corallo, to avenge Castellano and Bilotti by killing their successors; Gotti also planned to visit Failla that day, but canceled, and the bomb was detonated after a soldier who rode with DeCicco was mistaken for the boss. Bombs had long been banned by the Mafia out of concern that it would put innocent people in harm&#x27;s way, leading the Gambinos to initially suspect that &quot;zips&quot;—Sicilian &quot;mafiosi&quot; working in the U.S.—were behind it; zips were well known for using bombs.

Following the bombing, Judge Eugene Nickerson, presiding over Gotti&#x27;s racketeering trial, rescheduled the trial to avoid a jury tainted by the resulting publicity, while prosecutor Diane Giacalone had Gotti&#x27;s bail revoked due to evidence of witness intimidation in the Piecyk case. From jail, Gotti ordered the murder of Robert DiBernardo by Gravano; both DiBernardo and Ruggiero had been vying to succeed DeCicco until Ruggiero accused DiBernardo of challenging Gotti&#x27;s leadership. When Ruggiero, also under indictment, had his bail revoked for his abrasive behavior in preliminary hearings, a frustrated Gotti instead promoted Armone to underboss.

Jury selection for the racketeering case began again in August 1986, with Gotti standing trial alongside Willie Boy Johnson (who, despite being exposed as an informant, refused to turn state&#x27;s evidence), Leonard DiMaria, Tony Rampino, Nicholas Corozzo and John Carneglia. At this point, the Gambinos were able to compromise the case when George Pape hid his friendship with Radonjić and was empaneled as juror No. 11. Through Radonjić, Pape contacted Gravano and agreed to sell his vote on the jury for $60,000.

In the trial&#x27;s opening statements on September 25, Gotti&#x27;s defense attorney Bruce Cutler denied the existence of the Gambino family and framed the government&#x27;s entire effort as a personal vendetta. His main defense strategy during the prosecution was to attack the credibility of Giacalone&#x27;s witnesses by discussing their crimes committed before their turning state&#x27;s evidence. During Gotti&#x27;s defense, Cutler called bank robber Matthew Traynor, a would-be prosecution witness dropped for unreliability, who testified that Giacalone offered him drugs and her panties as a masturbation aid in exchange for his testimony; Traynor&#x27;s allegations would be dismissed by Judge Nickerson as &quot;wholly unbelievable&quot; after the trial, and he was subsequently convicted of perjury.

Despite Cutler&#x27;s defense and critiques about the prosecution&#x27;s performance, according to mob writers Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustain, when the jury&#x27;s deliberations began, a majority were in favor of convicting Gotti. However, due to Pape&#x27;s misconduct, Gotti knew from the beginning of the trial that he could do no worse than a hung jury. During deliberations, Pape held out for acquittal until the rest of the jury began to fear their own safety would be compromised. On March 13, 1987, they acquitted Gotti and his codefendants of all charges. Five years later, Pape was convicted of obstruction of justice for his part in the fix and sentenced to three years in prison.

In the face of previous Mafia convictions, particularly the success of the Mafia Commission Trial, Gotti&#x27;s acquittal was a major upset that further added to his reputation. The American media dubbed Gotti &quot;The Teflon Don&quot; in reference to the failure of any charges to &quot;stick&quot;.

====1992 conviction====
On December 11, 1990, FBI agents and NYPD detectives raided the Ravenite Social Club, arresting Gravano, Gotti and Locascio. Gravano pleaded guilty to a superseding racketeering charge, and Gotti charged with five murders (Castellano, Bilotti, DiBernardo, Liborio Milito and Louis Dibono), conspiracy to murder Gaetano Vastola, loansharking, illegal gambling, obstruction of justice, bribery and tax evasion. Based on tapes from FBI bugs played at pretrial hearings, the Gambino administration was denied bail. At the same time, attorneys Bruce Cutler and Gerald Shargel were disqualified from defending Gotti and Gravano after prosecutors successfully contended they were &quot;part of the evidence&quot; and thus liable to be called as witnesses. Prosecutors argued that Cutler and Shargel not only knew about potential criminal activity, but had worked as &quot;in-house counsel&quot; for the Gambino family. Gotti subsequently hired Albert Krieger, a Miami attorney who had worked with Joseph Bonanno, to replace Cutler.

The tapes also created a rift between Gotti and Gravano, showing the Gambino boss describing his newly appointed underboss as too greedy and attempting to frame Gravano as the main force behind the murders of DiBernardo, Milito and Dibono. Gotti&#x27;s attempt at reconciliation failed, leaving Gravano disillusioned with the mob and doubtful of his chances of winning his case without Shargel, his former attorney.

Gravano ultimately opted to turn state&#x27;s evidence, formally agreeing to testify on November 13, 1991. At the time, he was the highest-ranking member of a New York crime family to turn informer.

Gotti and Locascio were tried in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York before District Judge I. Leo Glasser. Jury selection began in January 1992 with an anonymous jury and, for the first time in a Brooklyn federal case, fully sequestered during the trial due to Gotti&#x27;s reputation for jury tampering. The trial commenced with the prosecution&#x27;s opening statements on February 12; prosecutors Andrew Maloney and John Gleeson began their case by playing tapes showing Gotti discussing Gambino family business, including murders he approved, and confirming the animosity between Gotti and Castellano to establish the former&#x27;s motive to kill his boss. After calling an eyewitness of the Sparks hit who identified Carneglia as one of the men who shot Bilotti, they then called Gravano as a witness on March 2.

On the stand, Gravano confirmed Gotti&#x27;s place in the structure of the Gambino family and described in detail the conspiracy to assassinate Castellano, giving a full description of the hit and its aftermath. Gravano confessed to 19 murders, implicating Gotti in four of them. Neither Krieger nor Anthony Cardinale, Locascio&#x27;s attorney, were able to shake Gravano during cross-examination. Among other outbursts, Gotti called Gravano a junkie while his attorneys sought to discuss his past steroid use. After presenting additional testimony and tapes, the government rested its case on March 24.

On June 23, 1992, Glasser sentenced Gotti and Locascio to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and a $250,000 fine. Gotti surrendered to federal authorities to serve his prison time on December 14, 1992. On September 26, 1994, a federal judge sentenced Gravano to five years in prison. However, since Gravano had already served four years, the sentence amounted to less than one year.

Gotti continued to rule the family from prison, while day-to-day operation of the family shifted to capos John &quot;Jackie Nose&quot; D&#x27;Amico and Nicholas &quot;Little Nick&quot; Corozzo. The latter was due to take over as acting boss but was himself sentenced to eight years in prison on racketeering charges. Gotti&#x27;s son John &quot;Junior&quot; Gotti took over as head of the family, but he pled guilty to racketeering in 1999 and was sentenced to 77 months in jail.

=== Peter Gotti ===
Peter Gotti took over control of the family some time likely in 2001 before his brother John Gotti died in prison on June 10, 2002. With Peter Gotti in charge the family&#x27;s fortunes dwindled to a remarkable extent, given their power a few decades ago when they were considered the most powerful criminal organization in America. Peter Gotti was imprisoned in 2003, and the leadership allegedly went to administration members Nicholas Corozzo, Jackie D&#x27;Amico, and Joseph Corozzo. Peter Gotti remained the official boss while in prison.

Gotti&#x27;s rivals regained control of the family, mostly because the rest of Gotti&#x27;s loyalists were either jailed or under indictments. Michael &quot;Mikey Scars&quot; DiLeonardo, the former head of the family&#x27;s white collar operations and one of the last Gotti supporters, turned state&#x27;s evidence due to increased law enforcement pressure and credible evidence to be presented in his racketeering trial and due to the administration shelving him accusing him of stealing money from the family. He chose to testify against mobsters from all of the Five Families. DiLeonardo testified against Peter Gotti and Anthony &quot;Sonny&quot; Ciccone, among others, from 2003 to 2005, and then disappeared into the Witness Protection Program.

In 2005, Nicholas &quot;Little Nick&quot; Corozzo and his longtime underling Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; DiMaria were released from prison after serving ten years for racketeering and loansharking charges in New York and Florida. That same year, US law enforcement recognized Corozzo as the boss of the Gambino crime family, with his brother Joseph Corozzo as the family consigliere, Arnold &quot;Zeke&quot; Squitieri as the acting underboss, and Jackie D&#x27;Amico as a highly regarded member with the Corozzo brothers.

On Thursday, February 7, 2008, a federal grand jury issued an indictment which led to the arrest of 54 Gambino family members and associates in New York City, its suburbs, New Jersey, and Long Island. This indictment was the culmination of a four-year FBI investigation known as Operation Old Bridge. It accused 62 people of murder, conspiracy, drug trafficking, robberies, extortion, and other crimes. The FBI used informant Joseph Vollaro as a government witness.

Operation Old Bridge broke up a growing alliance between the Gambinos and the Sicilian Mafia, which wanted to get further into the drug trade. One of those arrested in the raids in the US was Frank Cali, future boss of the Gambino family. He was allegedly the &quot;ambassador&quot; in the US for the Inzerillo crime family. Most of those arrested ended up pleading guilty, thus getting sentenced less than three years in prison.

===Domenico Cefalù and Frank Cali===
When federal and New York State authorities rounded up the entire Gambino family hierarchy in early 2008, a three-man panel of street bosses Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Marino, John Gambino and Bartolomeo Vernace took control of the Gambino family while the administration members were in prison. In July 2011, it was reported that Domenico Cefalù had been promoted to acting boss of the crime family, putting an end to the Gotti reign. Cefalù&#x27;s reign saw the Sicilian faction, better known as &quot;Zips&quot;, gain control of the Gambino crime family. It was reported by crime reporter Jerry Capeci that Cefalù stepped down in 2015 and his underboss, Frank Cali, took full control. However, a week later, Capeci issued a correction reporting that Cefalù remained the acting boss. The family was believed to have between 150 and 200 members as well as over 1100 associates.

The family continued to be active in a variety of criminal enterprises, including gambling, loansharking, extortion, labor racketeering, fraud, money laundering and narcotic trafficking. In 2012 the Gambino family still had some control on piers in Brooklyn and Staten Island through infiltrated labor unions. Indictments from 2008 to 2014 showed that the family was still very active in New York City.

During 2009, the Gambino family saw many important members released from prison. On November 18, 2009, the NYPD arrested 22 members and associates of the Luchese and Gambino crime families as part of &quot;Operation Pure Luck&quot;. The raid was a result of cases involving loansharking and sports gambling on Staten Island. There were also charges of bribing New York City court officers and Sanitation Department officials.

In 2014, FBI and Italian police arrested 17 members and associates of the &#x27;ndrangheta Mafia, in particular the Ursino clan, and 7 members and associates of the Gambino and Bonanno families. The arrested were accused by prosecutors and law enforcement officials of organizing a transatlantic drug ring with the aim of shipping 500 kg of pure cocaine from Guyana in South America to the port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria. US Attorney Loretta Lynch singled out Gambino family associate Franco Lupoi as the linchpin of the operation, accusing him of conspiring with his father-in-law, Nicola Antonio Simonetta, a member of the Ursino clan, to set up the network.

On December 12, 2017, five associates of the Gambino family, Thomas Anzaone, Alessandro &quot;Sandro&quot; Damelio, Joseph Durso, Anthony Rodolico, and Anthony Saladino, along with 74-year-old captain John &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Ambrosio, were arrested and accused of operating an illegal racketeering enterprise from January 2014 to December 2017, involving racketeering, extortion, drug trafficking, loansharking and illegal gambling. Bonanno crime family soldier, Frank &quot;Frankie Boy&quot; Salerno, was also arrested and accused of conspiring with the Gambino crime family. Associates Anzaone, Damelio and Durso, together with Bonanno soldier Saladino, were alleged to have sold cocaine, marijuana and Xanax in large quantities. Prosecutors said Salerno and Saladino sourced the drugs in kilograms then sold it to the others to be distributed. An undercover agent alleged that he paid $1,250 for of cocaine and also bought nearly a kilogram in 12 different sales between February and June in 2016.

Ambrosio was said to have been the head of a very profitable loansharking and illegal gambling operation, including unlicensed gambling parlors, electronic gaming machines and internet sports betting. Prosecutors said that he and Rodolico attempted to obstruct the federal grand jury proceeding into their criminal activities by intimidating a loan shark victim into lying to law enforcement.

Frank Cali was shot dead on March 13, 2019, outside his home on Staten Island by a lone gunman. Cali&#x27;s murder was the first murder of a boss since the 1985 assassination of Paul Castellano. Three days later, 24-year-old Anthony Comello was arrested and charged with the murder. Authorities reportedly believe the crime was related to a personal dispute rather than any organized crime activity.

=== Current position and leadership ===
Following Cali&#x27;s death, it was reported that Lorenzo Mannino had become the new Gambino leader.

On March 14, 2019, Gambino family associate Anthony Pandrella was indicted for the murder and robbery of 77-year-old loan shark Vincent Zito on October 26, 2018. According to court papers, Pandrella murdered Zito out of fear that he would kill him first over an unpaid $750,000 debt he owed him. The day he was supposed to pay the debt, Pandrella visited Zito at his home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn and shot him at point-blank range in the back of the head, stealing Zito&#x27;s loan business&#x27; assets and cleaning up any incriminating evidence at the scene before getting out of the house. Hours after murdering him, Pandrella came back to his house to tend to Zito&#x27;s family and friends and question them about developments in the police homicide investigation. On June 14, 2022, Pandrella was found guilty of robbery, murder, and unlawful use of a firearm. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison on October 6, 2022.

In July 2019, Thomas Gambino, 47, (considered by the FBI to be a significant member of the Gambino family) was one of 15 suspected members of the Inzerillo crime family arrested in coordinated raids in Sicily and the United States. Italian police said Gambino was caught on video meeting with ranking members of the Inzerillo clan on a speedboat off the coast of Palermo a year earlier, allegedly discussing the sale of property formerly owned by Frank Cali. Rosario Gambino was also arrested.

On December 5, 2019, Gambino family capo Andrew Campos and nine other gangsters were arrested in a federal mob crackdown in the Bronx and Westchester County, on allegations of threats of violence to extort money. On December 6, John Simonlacaj, cousin of Mark &quot;Chippy&quot; Kocaj and a managing director of the HFZ Capital Group was arraigned in Brooklyn Federal Court on federal charges of wire fraud conspiracy and tax fraud. Prosecutors alleged that CWC Contracting, operated by Kocaj, Campos and Vincent Fiore, paid bribes to employees of numerous construction companies and real estate developers, including HFZ Capital.

On January 18, 2023, Gambino family capo Frank &quot;Calypso&quot; Camuso, soldier Louis Astuto and associate Robert &quot;Rusty&quot; Baselice were indicted along 20 other defendants including Genovese family soldier Christopher &quot;Jerry&quot; Chierchio, and 26 companies by the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s Office for a kickback scheme operated by Baselice, the vice president of the Grimaldi Group, a firm which allegedly received $4.2 million from contractors. From April 2013 to July 2021, Baselice reportedly used his position to steal from his firm&#x27;s developer clients by providing inside information about competitors&#x27; bids to subcontractors, among other offenses. According to the indictment, Astuto and family associate Paul Noto distributed a portion of the proceeds from the kickbacks to companies Camuso and his family owned.

On November 8, 2023, 16 Gambino family members and associates were indicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy, extortion, witness retaliation, and union corruption. Included in the indictment was Joseph Lanni, a Gambino captain, and soldiers Angelo &quot;Fifi&quot; Gradilone, James LaForte, and Diego &quot;Danny&quot; Tantillo. The arrests were a joint effort between American federal authorities and Italian authorities. The arrested mobsters were accused of using violent tactics to infiltrate garbage and carting companies to extort money and gain &quot;no-show jobs&quot;. Soldier Diego Tantillo is also accused of embezzling funds from employee pension plans, and conspiring to rig bids for demolition contracts throughout New York City.

17 members and associates of the Gambino family were charged in an 84-count indictment on June 5, 2024 in relation to the operation of Staten Island-based illegal sports gambling operation, which handled more than $22.7 million in illegal bets, and a loansharking operation that generated approximately $500,000 per week from loan payments. Among those arrested were Gambino soldiers John J. LaForte, Anthony J. Cinque, Jr. and John Matera, Gambino associates Edward A. LaForte, Frederick P. Falcone, Sr., Giulio Pomponio and Daniel F. Bogan, and Colombo family associate Charles Fusco.

==Historical leadership==
The Gambino crime family had a hierarchical structure similar to the other Italian-American mafias. Their commander in chief, the &quot;boss&quot; was the oversight for the entire group. The second in command, the &quot;underboss&quot;, was usually a close relative or friend of the boss. They were expected to take over (in most cases) as the successor to the boss if he were to go to prison or die. The boss had a Consigliere who was the mentor to the boss, who assisted him on decision making. The Capos were in charge of the crews of soldiers, and were over a territory of New York City. They ensured the crews of lower-ranked members were following the rules from the Boss and moving forward with the organization&#x27;s goals. The &quot;soldiers&quot; were doing most of the work for the crime family, and they would be sworn into the system and used as runners for the family. Within the soldiers, there were &quot;earners&quot; and &quot;enforcers&quot;. The earners would push revenue and get the cash for the organization and the enforcers would utilize violent acts if necessary and if they were told to do so by the Boss. The soldiers were &quot;made&quot; men, which meant that they were protected from being killed unless the Boss approves of it. The lowest members from the organization were called &quot;associates&quot;, who would commit criminal acts for the organization but were not &quot;made&quot;. The benefit of being an associate would be the distance from the organization, including the oath that the associate wouldn&#x27;t have to make for the mafia.

Carlo Gambino&#x27;s relatives controlled the Inzerillo clan under Salvatore Inzerillo in Passo di Ragano, a neighborhood in Palermo, Sicily.

The Gambino brothers ran a Cafe on 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst and took their name Cherry Hill Gambinos from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The Gambino family in America began increasing in size with more Sicilian members.

Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned&quot;.

==Alliances with other criminal groups==

===The Gambino-Lucchese-Genovese===
The Gambino-Lucchese-Genovese alliance (1953–1985) between Carlo Gambino, Tommy Lucchese, and Vito Genovese began with a plot to take over the Mafia Commission by murdering family bosses Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia. At that time, Gambino was Anastasia&#x27;s new underboss and Vito Genovese was the underboss for Costello. Their first target was Costello on May 2, 1957. Costello survived the assassination attempt, but immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Their second target was Anastasia on October 25, 1957. The Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop, opening the war for Gambino to become the new boss of the now-Gambino crime family. After assuming power, Gambino started conspiring with Lucchese to remove their former ally Genovese. In 1959, with the assistance of Lucky Luciano, Costello, and Meyer Lansky, Genovese was arrested and Gambino assumed full control with Lucchese of the Mafia Commission. Under Gambino and Lucchese, the Commission pushed Bonanno boss Joseph Bonanno out of power, triggering an internal war in that family. In the 1960s, the Commission backed the Gallo brothers in their rebellion against Profaci family boss Joe Profaci. In 1962, Gambino&#x27;s oldest son Thomas married Lucchese&#x27;s daughter, strengthening the Gambino and Luchese family alliance. Lucchese gave Gambino access into the New York airports rackets he controlled, and Gambino allowed Lucchese into some of their rackets. After Lucchese death in July 1967, Gambino used his power over the Commission to appoint Carmine Tramunti as the new Luchese family leader. Gambino later continued the alliance with Tramunti&#x27;s successor, Anthony Corallo. After Gambino&#x27;s death, new Gambino boss Paul Castellano continued the Luchese alliance. In 1985, the original Gambino-Luchese alliance dissolved when John Gotti ordered Castellano&#x27;s assassination and took power in the Gambino family without Commission approval.

===The Gambino-Lucchese===
The Gambino-Lucchese alliance (1999–present) was initiated by acting Luchese boss Steven Crea in 1999. The two families extorted the construction industry and made millions of dollars in bid-rigging. In early 2002, Luchese capo John Capra worked with Gambino acting boss Arnold Squitieri, acting underboss Anthony Megale, and Bronx-based acting capo Gregory DePalma. The group was involved in illegal gambling and extortion activities in Westchester County, New York. The members were arrested in 2005 leading to the revelation that Gambino acting capo DePalma had allowed an FBI agent Joaquín García (known as Jack Falcone) work undercover with his crew since 2002. In late 2008, Gambino family acting capo Andrew Merola teamed with Luchese Jersey faction acting boss Martin Taccetta in an illegal gambling ring, shaking down unions, and extorting car dealerships. Merola was indicted in 2008 and Taccetta was returned to prison in 2009.

===The Gambino-Genovese===
The Gambino-Genovese alliance (1962–1972) was between Carlo Gambino and Genovese family acting boss/front boss Thomas Eboli. The alliance was short-lived because Eboli was unable or unwilling to repay Gambino money from a bad narcotics deal. The alliance ended when Gambino ordered Eboli&#x27;s murder on July 16, 1972.

===The Gambino-Bonanno===
The Gambino-Bonanno alliance (1991–2004) started with John Gotti and new Bonanno boss Joseph Massino. As a member of the Mafia Commission, Gotti helped Massino regain the Bonanno commission seat that was lost in the early 1980s. The Gambino family influenced the Bonanno family to give up narcotics trafficking and return to more traditional Cosa Nostra crimes (loan sharking, gambling, stock fraud, etc.) By the late 1990s, the Bonannos had become almost as strong as the Gambinos.

===The Gambino-Westies===
The Gambino-Westies alliance (1977–1992) resulted from an ongoing war between the Genovese family and the Westies, an Irish-American street gang in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of Manhattan. Genovese front boss Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno wanted to seize control of lucrative construction rackets at the new Jacob Javits Convention Center from the Westies. When the Westies balked, Salerno ordered the murder of the top gang leaders. Eventually, the Genovese family invited the Gambinos to broker a peace agreement with the Westside Gang. As part of this agreement, the Westies formed an alliance with Gambino soldier Roy DeMeo.

===The Gambino-Corleonesi===
This association was revealed in May 2019 when news reports indicated that a Cosa Nostra insider revealed that John Gotti of the Gambino family had sent one of their explosives experts to Sicily to work with the Corleonesi Mafia clan. This individual allegedly helped plan the Capaci bombing that was set by Giovanni Brusca to kill prosecuting judge Giovanni Falcone and his team. One mafia expert was surprised that the two groups would cooperate because the American Cosa Nostra was affiliated with the rivals of the Corleonesi. But another expert said the joint effort was understandable. &quot;It may be that the Gambinos at a certain point recognised that the Corleonesi had been victorious in the war between rival families in Sicily ... there is nothing unusual in the traffic of personnel and ideas across the Atlantic ... they were cousin organisations,&quot; according to John Dickie, professor of Italian studies at University College London and the author of &quot;Mafia Republic – Italy&#x27;s Criminal Curse&quot;.

In the movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, Gambino family made member William &quot;Billy Batts&quot; DeVino (played by Frank Vincent) is killed in a fight with Thomas DeSimone (portrayed as &quot;Tommy DeVito&quot; by Joe Pesci), a Lucchese crime family associate.

<text>Baron Heytesbury (pronounced &#x27;Hetsbury&#x27;), of Heytesbury in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1828 for the prominent politician and diplomat Sir William à Court, 2nd Baronet, who later served as Ambassador to Russia and as Viceroy of Ireland. His son, the second Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight. On his marriage in 1837 to Elizabeth Holmes, daughter of Sir Leonard Worsley Holmes, Lord Heytesbury assumed the additional surname of Holmes. His son the 4th baron commanded a battalion in the Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s) and was for a time in command of 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot. , the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 2004.

The baronetcy, of Heytesbury House in the County of Wiltshire, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 4 July 1795 for the first Baron&#x27;s father, William à Court. He was a colonel in the army and represented Heytesbury in the House of Commons. His father, William Ashe-à Court, was a general in the army and also sat as a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Heytesbury.

A junior line of the family has attained fortune and fame in Australia, thanks to the business empire of Robert Holmes à Court, who was of South African birth, and his Western Australian wife Janet, formerly one of Australia&#x27;s richest women. Their vast business interests are managed through Heytesbury Pty Ltd, a company named after the family peerage.

<text>Baron Hatherton, of Hatherton in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1835 for the politician Edward Littleton, Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1833 to 1834. Born Edward Walhouse, he assumed in 1812 by Royal licence the surname of Littleton in lieu of his patronymic on succeeding to the estates of his great-uncle Sir Edward Littleton, 4th and last Baronet, of Teddesley Hall. He was also heir to the substantial Walhouse estates and interests, which included Hatherton Hall, near Cannock, then in an exclave of Wolverhampton. His wealth was based upon landed estates centred on Penkridge in southern Staffordshire, mines at Great Wyrley and Bloxwich, quarries and sandpits, brick yards and residential housing, mainly in Walsall.

Lord Hatherton was succeeded by his son, Edward Richard, the second Baron, who represented Walsall in the House of Commons as a Liberal. His son, the third Baron, notably served as Military Secretary to the Governor General of Canada between 1875 and 1879. The title followed the line of his eldest son, the fourth Baron, until the death of the latter&#x27;s third son, the seventh Baron, in 1985. The late Baron was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth and () present holder of the title. He is the grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Charles Christopher Josceline Littleton, third son of the third Baron.

In 1919, the 3rd Baron Hatherton disposed of large estates in the Penkridge area. In many cases, farms were sold to their tenants. The 5th Baron Hatherton made even larger disposals of landed property, selling over at Penkridge and in Teddesley Hay in 1953, including the 18th century seat, Teddesley Hall.

Pitzer is known for its social justice culture and experimental pedagogical approach.

==History==
Pitzer was founded in 1963 as a women&#x27;s college by Russell K. Pitzer (1878–1978), a California citrus magnate, philanthropist, and Pomona College alumnus. In April 1963, John W. Atherton, the dean of faculty and a professor of English at Claremont Men&#x27;s College (now Claremont McKenna College) was hired as Pitzer&#x27;s first president, and over the next seventeen months he recruited students, faculty, and trustees and constructed Scott and Sanborn Halls just in time for the fall 1964 semester. During the college&#x27;s first year, students and faculty created the curriculum and the school&#x27;s system of governance. The college graduated its first class of students in 1965 and became co-educational in the fall of 1970. The first academic term in the fall of 1964 began with eleven professors and 153 students from sixteen states and five countries. Pitzer&#x27;s sixth president, Melvin L. Oliver, is the first African American to lead any of the five Claremont Colleges.

==Campus==

Pitzer&#x27;s campus is in Claremont, California, covering an area of approximately . The campus is located approximately west of LA/Ontario International Airport and Los Angeles can be accessed via Metrolink. Access to campus is also provided via Interstate 10 and Interstate 210. The campus comprises sixteen buildings, including five residence halls. West and East Halls earned Platinum LEED certification when they opened 2012.

The Pitzer College campus occupies the northeast corner of the Claremont Colleges property, which contains seven institutions of higher education coordinated through the Claremont University Consortium. The Claremont Colleges comprise Pomona College (founded in 1887), Claremont Graduate University (1925), Scripps College (1926), Claremont McKenna College (1946), Harvey Mudd College (1955), Pitzer College (1963), and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences (1997). At present, the campus is split approximately in half by Pitzer Road. Harvey Mudd College is adjacent to Pitzer&#x27;s north, Scripps to the west, and Claremont McKenna to the south.
Contemporary architecture characterizes the majority of Pitzer&#x27;s buildings, several of which were designed by Gwathmey-Siegel following major donations from Eli Broad, a board member emeritus and former chair of the Pitzer College Board of Trustees. A notable exception is the Grove House, a California bungalow built in 1902 for a local citrus grower during the height of the Arts and Crafts movement. The building, a popular campus hangout to this day, was purchased for $1.00 and moved to Pitzer in 1977 under the direction of professor emeritus Barry Sanders. The Grove House is home to a cafe, the Women&#x27;s Center, the Hinshaw Gallery and the EcoCenter.

Most landscaping on the campus follows principles of xeriscaping. Several varieties of citrus and other fruit are grown throughout campus and an organic community garden, dedicated grove and chicken coop are located north of Mead Hall. The 10-acre John R. Rodman Arboretum, an attempt to save surviving native chaparral vegetation from demolition, was founded in 1984. It contains 16 themed gardens with drought-tolerant, native landscaping.

The campus also includes auditoriums, sports courts, and science buildings.

Located directly northwest of the main campus, the Robert J. Bernard Biological Field Station, a resource of The Claremont Colleges, is an nature preserve consisting of coastal sage scrub.

The Outback Preserve, located in the northeast section of campus, occupies just over three acres of the John Rodman Arboretum. The preserve is home to one of the rarest ecosystems in the world: Alluvial Sage Scrub. Undergoing ecological restoration as part of the Outback Restoration Project, the preserve is a living-learning laboratory. The project seeks to restore the Outback Preserve to a more intact alluvial sage scrub ecosystem, removing invasive plants and ensuring the success of native species. Each semester there are a small number of courses utilizing the Outback Preserve. Courses are open to all students at the Claremont Colleges.

Pitzer owns and operates a field station on secondary growth rainforest, the Firestone Center for Restoration Ecology. The facility is located approximately two kilometers east of Playa Dominical, Costa Rica. The property borders the Hacienda Barú nature reserve. The center is home to programs in Pitzer&#x27;s science, language and international studies curricula.

Much of Pitzer&#x27;s community engagement occurs in the Community Engagement Center (CEC). The CEC runs the Pitzer in Ontario Program, a comprehensive semester-long service learning and cultural immersion program with a strong theoretical foundation in the human sciences informed by the best practices in the field of experiential education. The program integrates extensive internship experiences in city, private or non-profit organizations with interdisciplinary coursework that provides the theoretical framework from which social and urban issues can be evaluated.

At the Campus Compact 20/20 Visioning Summit on October 17, 2006, the Corporation for National and Community Service recognized Pitzer as one of 28 California campuses distinguished for community service and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.

Through the Community Engagement Center, dozens of Pitzer students volunteer each semester with programs at Camp Afflerbaugh and California Youth Authority Chino.

===Events and traditions===
Kohoutek Music and Arts Festival began in 1974 and is a student-run multi-day outdoor music and arts festival held each spring on the Pitzer campus. The event, which is free and open to all Claremont Colleges community members, is named after Comet Kohoutek. The festival generally includes student vendors, fire performances, a farmers market, and other activities.

Reggae Fest began in 2003 as a fall concert event. The festival runs over the course of a single day and features professional bands, free food, and beverages. In 2016, the Pitzer College Student Senate suspended funding for the event amid concerns that it was culturally appropriative and disrespectful toward Jamaican culture.

<text>Baron Hampton, of Hampton Lovett and of Westwood in the County of Worcester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1874 for the Conservative politician Sir John Pakington, 1st Baronet.

==History==
John Somerset Pakington (1799–1880) had previously represented Droitwich in the House of Commons, and had served as Secretary of State for War, and as First Lord of the Admiralty. He had been created a Baronet of Westwood Park in 1846. Born John Somerset Russell, he had assumed by royal licence the surname of Pakington in lieu in 1830, on inheriting the estates of his maternal uncle Sir John Pakington, 8th and last Baronet, of Ailesbury. He died aged 81.

The first Lord Hampton was succeeded in 1880 by his eldest son, John Slaney Pakington (1826–1893), the second Baron, then aged 53. Upon his death, aged 66 in 1893, the title passed to the second Baron&#x27;s half-brother.

The third Baron was Herbert Perrott Murray Pakington (1848–1906), a half-brother to the second Baron, who succeeded to the title aged 45. Upon his death at 58 in 1906, the title passed to Herbert Stuart Pakington (1883–1962), the third Baron&#x27;s second but eldest surviving son, then aged just 22. He served as Chief Commissioner of The Scout Association. Upon his death at 79, he was succeeded by 74-year-old Humphrey Arthur Pakington (1888–1974), the younger brother of the fourth Baron. Upon his death at 85, the title passed to 48-year-old Richard Humphrey Russell Pakington (1925–2003), the son of the fifth Baron. He sat as a Liberal member of the House of Lords, and was the party&#x27;s Spokesman on Northern Ireland in the House of Lords from 1977 to 1987. On his death at 78 in 2003 his son succeeded him.

John Humphrey Arnott Pakington (b. 1964), son of the above, succeeded in 2003, aged 38.

As of December 2014, the current Lord Hampton had successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

<text>The Spandau Citadel () is a fortress in Berlin, Germany, one of the best-preserved Renaissance military structures of Europe. Built from 1559–94 atop a medieval fort on an island near the meeting of the Havel and the Spree, it was designed to protect the town of Spandau, which is now part of Berlin. In recent years it has been used as a museum and has become a popular tourist spot. Furthermore, the inner courtyard of the Citadel has served as an open air concert venue in the summertime since 2005.

==History==

In 1157, Albert the Bear built a frontier fortress at this site, and by the middle of the 15th century, the site was the Margrave of Brandenburg seat of government. By 1560, Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg engaged Christoph Römer to build an Italian style fortress, incorporating the older castle, Palas, and Julius Tower. In 1562, Römer was replaced by Francesco Chiaramella de Gandino. In 1578 Rochus Graf zu Lynar took over.

In 1580, the first troops were assigned to Spandau Citadel, although its construction was not complete until 1594. Swedish troops were the first to besiege the citadel in 1675. In 1806 the citadel&#x27;s garrison surrendered to the French army under Napoleon without firing a shot during the Fall of Berlin. It was retaken by Prussian and Russian forces in 1813, but the ramparts were heavily damaged during the battle and required extensive restoration. The citadel was also used as a prison for Prussian state prisoners, including German nationalist Friedrich Ludwig Jahn.

In 1935, the Army&#x27;s Gas Protection Laboratory was installed. The site employed about 300 scientist and technicians working on chemical weapons (including synthesis, animal and human testing, munitions development, and development of manufacturing processes). Much of the work developing nerve gas was done here.
Close to the end of the Second World War, during the battle in Berlin, the citadel became a part of the city&#x27;s defences. Although several hundred years old, the Citadel&#x27;s &quot;tracé à l&#x27;italienne&quot; design made the structure difficult to storm. So instead of bombarding and storming the Citadel, the Soviets invested it and set about negotiating a surrender. After negotiations, the citadel&#x27;s commander surrendered to the Lieutenant-General Perkhorovitch&#x27;s 47th Army just after 15:00 on 1 May 1945, saving many lives and leaving the Renaissance bastion fort intact.

After the Second World War, the Spandau Citadel was first occupied by Soviet troops. After the division of Berlin by the Allied powers, Spandau and its Citadel were part of the British sector. Despite its history as a prison, the Citadel was not used to hold National Socialist war criminals. Rather, they were housed at Spandau prison in the same Berlin borough.

The Citadel now houses a museum, the &quot;Zitadelle&quot;; among the exhibitions is a collection of sculptures that have been removed from public display in Berlin over previous centuries, including statues of Friedrich Wilhelm III and Queen Luise, Nazi art, and the head of a 19-metre statue of Lenin.

==Structure==

The citadel is composed of different buildings all related to defence or representative housing. The gate house with a draw bridge used to hinder attackers from entering the citadel. The Gothic hall building palace was used as residential building. Gravestones dating back to 1244 bear witness to Jewish life as an important trade town, and the function of the citadel as a refuge. Julius tower is Spandau&#x27;s most famous sight. Originally built as a keep or watchtower, it was also used as a residence tower. Its castellated top was designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1838 and is an example of Romantic architecture. After the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, part of the war reparations paid by France, 120 million marks in gold coin, was stored at Julius tower until its restitution to France in 1919.

The word &quot;Juliusturm&quot; has since been used in Germany for governmental budget surpluses.

From 1950 to 1986, the citadel housed vocational school Otto Bartning. Subsequently, more and more buildings were redesigned for museums and exhibition. Today, Spandau Citadel is famous for its open-air concerts during the Citadel Music Festival.

Scenes from the 1985 action film &quot;Gotcha!&quot; were filmed at and around Spandau Citadel.

<text>Martina Gillian Topley-Bird (&quot;née&quot; Topley; born 7 May 1975) is an English singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who first gained fame as the featured female vocalist on trip hop pioneer Tricky&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; (1995). She also worked with him on his subsequent albums, &quot;Nearly God&quot; and &quot;Pre-Millennium Tension&quot; (both in 1996). In 2003, Topley-Bird released her debut solo album, &quot;Quixotic&quot;, which was critically praised and earned her a Mercury Prize nomination.

This was followed by &quot;Anything&quot; (2004), &quot;The Blue God&quot; (2008), and &quot;Some Place Simple&quot; (2010). She has also collaborated with Gorillaz, appearing on their album &quot;Demon Days&quot; (2005), as well as with Mark Lanegan, Diplo, and Massive Attack on &quot;Heligoland&quot; (2010), which she followed by a world tour with the group. Her song &quot;Sandpaper Kisses&quot; was covered by Stephen Marley and sampled by artists such as Berry Weight and The Weeknd and used in the video game Fahrenheit.

==Early life==
Martina Topley-Bird was born in London, England, to Charlette Conlon (&quot;née&quot; Pouncey) and Martin Geoffrey Topley, who died in 1974 before her birth; Martina was named after him. Her stepfather is British direct marketing specialist Drayton Bird, whose surname she adopted in addition to her father&#x27;s. Her mother is of Salvadoran and Seminole descent, while her father was of untraceable African-American descent. Topley-Bird grew up in a large family, with five siblings and three step-siblings.

Her family later relocated from London to Bristol. &quot;We moved about a bit when I was a child, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me&quot;, she recalled. &quot;If you&#x27;re not white and middle-class, then you&#x27;re slightly different and exotic in those new environments. I thrived, and survived, on those situations.&quot; She attended Clifton College, where she was a member of the school choir and took piano lessons.

Topley-Bird grew up listening to R&amp;B, opera and soul music throughout her childhood. As a teenager, she began listening to alternative rock, and became a fan of The Sugarcubes, Faith No More and Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

==Career==
===Collaboration with Tricky===
In 1993, as a teenager at Clifton College, Topley-Bird was discovered by trip hop pioneer Tricky when he saw her sitting on a wall near his house, singing to herself. &quot;That&#x27;s really how it happened,&quot; she recalled. &quot;It&#x27;s one of those things people are always surprised to find out is true. I remember the graveyard behind the wall. A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We&#x27;d been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn&#x27;t in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: &quot;Yeah, this is Tricky&#x27;s house, jump in through the window.&quot; So I jumped through, opened the door and we got mashed.&quot;

She and Tricky formed a musical partnership, and Topley-Bird collaborated with Tricky as a featured vocalist on his debut album &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; (1995) (a printing error credited her as &quot;Martine&quot;). Almost all of her vocals on the album were recorded in a single take. In describing the recording sessions, she recalled: &quot;It was totally instinctive. There was no time to drum up an alter ego. I liked the idea that the information people needed about me was what they would hear when they put the record on. Anything else was sort of extraneous. I didn&#x27;t think there was anything in my biography that would explain my musical choices.&quot; Topley-Bird continued her collaboration with Tricky on his follow-up albums &quot;Nearly God&quot; (1996), &quot;Pre-Millennium Tension&quot; (1996) and &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1998).

===Solo career===
Following a deterioration of her professional and personal relationship with Tricky in 1998, Topley-Bird began pursuing a solo career. It was not until 2003 that she released her debut album, &quot;Quixotic&quot; through Independiente Records, which she recorded in Los Angeles, California. The record was mainly produced by Topley-Bird and production team AMP9 (Alex McGowan, Steve Crittall, Nick Bird) at Space Eko Recording Studios London. She commented on the ideas underpinning the album, saying: A lot of it is about the notion of physical proximity relative to emotional connections between people. My dad, Martin Topley, died when he was twenty-nine. Between the release of &quot;Quixotic&quot; and now, I turned twenty-nine, and I started thinking about what I&#x27;d achieved in my life as a human being. Also I wanted to focus on the nature of my relationship with him and with my step father because of the way I felt those relationships were affecting my other relationships.
&quot;Quixotic&quot; peaked at No. 70 on the UK Albums Chart, received positive reviews from critics, and was a finalist for the 2003 Mercury Music Prize. The album finally saw a limited release in the United States in July 2004, when the Palm Pictures label released a re-designed and re-sequenced version under the title &quot;Anything&quot;, which featured a shorter track listing and all-new cover art. The following year she appeared on the Starbucks compilation album &quot;Sweetheart 2005: Love Songs&quot;, which features contemporary musicians covering classic love songs. She sang &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;, a song originally by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin.

Her second solo album, &quot;The Blue God&quot;, was released in May 2008. The track &quot;Carnies&quot; was released as the first single on 3 March 2008 and reached No. 20 on the UK Indie Charts. &quot;Poison&quot; was released as the second single and reached No. 9 on the Indie Charts. The album received generally positive critical reception; the BBC said it &quot;warps reflections of Ella Fitzgerald, two-tone ska, dark psychedelia and Pentangle&#x27;s &#x27;acid folk&#x27; into unsettling shapes ... It&#x27;s an often astonishing album and one which, if Tricky&#x27;s forthcoming comeback can&#x27;t match it, may curse him to be known as &#x27;that bloke who used to rap with Martina Topley Bird.

In 2010, Topley-Bird appeared on the album &quot;Heligoland&quot; by Massive Attack, lending her voice on the tracks &quot;Psyche&quot; and &quot;Babel&quot;. She also toured with Massive Attack as their support act and providing guest vocals at their shows. Her third album, &quot;Some Place Simple&quot;, was released in July 2010. It contained stripped-down versions of songs from her first two releases, along with four new songs. Topley-Bird performed &quot;Maxinquaye&quot; live at the Sundance Festival, London, in April 2012, and also appeared on the tracks &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Secret&quot; on electronic musician Clark&#x27;s album &quot;Iradelphic&quot;. In 2013 contributed to a cover of the xx&#x27;s &quot;Crystalised&quot; with Mark Lanegan and Warpaint, and also toured with Warpaint as a supporting act on their 2013 world tour. On 26 January 2015, she appeared as lead vocalist on title track &quot;The Day is My Enemy&quot;, the second single of The Prodigy&#x27;s, from their album &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot; (2015).

In 2018 Martina Topley-Bird released the single &quot;Solitude&quot;, which would subsequently appear on the four-track EP &quot;MTB Continued&quot;.

In May 2021 Topley-Bird released the single &quot;Pure Heart&quot; from her album &quot;Forever I Wait&quot; released in September of the same year. In a &quot;The Guardian&quot; interview, Topley-Bird stated she was a lot happier with the end results compared to her previous albums. Also, noting it does not directly address the death of her daughter, largely being written beforehand.

==Influences==
Topley-Bird cites Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday as vocal influences, as well as Tom Waits and Serge Gainsbourg as instrumental influences. She has cited Bollywood and Asian cinema as an influence on her album artwork as well, including the work of Park Chan-wook.

==Personal life==
Topley-Bird has an elder sister named Elizabeth. She had one daughter with Tricky. Mina Mazy (19 March 1995 – 8 May 2019) was born one month after the release of &quot;Maxinquaye&quot;. Mazy died by suicide after suffering a psychotic episode.

She has said that she does not consider herself religious, though she &quot;believes in the need to have a healthy spiritual life&quot;. 

As of 2021 she lived with her partner in Valencia, Spain.

<text>Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), and part of the Everglades Headwaters NWR complex, located just off the western coast of Orchid Island, Florida in the Indian River Lagoon east of Sebastian, Florida. The refuge consists of a island that includes an additional of surrounding water and is located off the east coast of Florida of the Indian River Lagoon. Established by an executive order of President Theodore Roosevelt on March 14, 1903, Pelican Island was the first National wildlife refuge in the United States. It was created to protect egrets and other birds from extinction through plume hunting. The oldest government wildlife refuge of any kind in North America is the Lake Merritt Bird Refuge in Oakland, California. Oakland Mayor Samuel Merritt declared it a wildlife refuge for migrating birds in 1869. In 1870, the state of California designated Lake Merritt a state game refuge. 

==Management==
Pelican Island is administered as part of the &quot;Everglades Headwaters NWR complex&quot; along with Archie Carr NWR, Lake Wales Ridge NWR, and the Everglades Headwaters NWR and Conservation Area, created in 2012 (556th unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System) with a donation and other lands covering approximately north of Lake Okeechobee. will be held under &quot;conservation easement&quot;s through the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This allows landowners the right to retain ownership of the land, with the ability to continue farming or ranching, ensuring that the land can&#x27;t be subdivided or developed.

Pelican Island NWR has been placed on the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance along with other areas of wetlands in the United States.

== History ==
In 1860 census listed population of two people and in the 1880 census listed that less than 30 individuals lived in the St. Sebastian River area. Pelican Island&#x27;s bird populations were threatened because of increased American settlement around the area in the mid-19th century. Many of the exotic birds were killed for their feathers, used in the fashion industry. Plumes from the birds were used to adorn ladies&#x27; hats of the day and at the time were worth more than their weight in gold.

Paul Kroegel, a German immigrant, moved to Florida in 1881 and lived on the west bank of Indian River Lagoon. He was fascinated with the pelicans on the island. Being able to see the island from his home, Paul would watch the pelicans and other water birds. He eventually took an interest in the island and its protection. However, there was not any state or federal law to help him so he took control of the situation himself. Kroegel sailed to the island to stand guard and protect the birds and the island.

A few naturalists visited Kroegel at Pelican Island. A curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Frank Chapman, was one of the naturalists showing interest in the island as well. He discovered that Pelican Island was one of the last rookeries of brown pelicans on the eastern coast of Florida.

The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union and the Florida Audubon Society led a campaign to pass legislation for protection of non-game birds in 1901. Knowing that the protection of Pelican Island would require more legislation, Chapman and his fellow advocate, William Dutcher went to President Theodore Roosevelt at his home in New York. The two appealed their case to Roosevelt&#x27;s conservative ethics. On 14 March 1903, President Roosevelt signed an executive order that established Pelican Island as the first federal bird reservation. This was the first time that the federal government put land aside for the sake of wildlife. The area, however, was open for big game hunters. Kroegel was hired as the first national wildlife refuge manager until 1926. He was paid $1 per month by the Audubon Society, as Congress had not made financial provisions for the refuge.

===Recent threats===
During the 1960s, Pelican Island was threatened by attempts to sell the surrounding wetlands and islands to developers. Local citizens led a fight to protect Pelican Island by stopping the sale of the wetlands. The Indian River Area Preservation League, formed by local citrus growers, commercial fishermen, and sportsmen, joined with Florida Audubon Society to convince the State to include the islands as a part of the refuge.
&quot;Later in 1963, Pelican Island was designated as a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior because of its status as the first federal area set aside specifically to protect wildlife.&quot;
In 1968, Florida agreed to expand to include nearly 5000 acres (20 km2) of mangrove islands and other submerged lands. In 1970, Pelican Island became the smallest wilderness area in the National Wilderness Preservation System at 3 acres. Since, the refuge has gained over 500 acres (2 km2) through purchases, management agreements, and conservation easements to provide a buffer against encroaching development and also to be a link to the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge. Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge was added to the list of wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention signed in 1971.

Today, Pelican Island is also threatened by shoreline development. Shoreline development has many negative impacts associated with it. Shoreline development can reduce the water quality by increasing the runoff of sediments, fertilizers, and pesticides. These runoffs will cause decline in water quality, and this can directly affect the food base that sustains the island&#x27;s nesting bird colonies. Waterfront development will also lead to more boat traffic. This extra boat traffic will also negatively affect the birds on the coast. Not only this, development of the shorelines of Pelican Island will permanently flaw the pristine character of this unique National Historic Landmark.

=== Budget cuts ===
Pelican Island, along with many other wildlife refuges, has been experiencing budget cuts. Many problems arise from the stagnant budget and lack of maintenance in the wildlife refuges. These are vital to preserve the habitat and the wildlife and to provide public education and recreation. This situation worsened further because of the failure of congress to timely pass federal funding bills.

Staffing at Pelican Island is made up of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The staff members have recently fallen from six to two which has had many negative consequences. The cuts have led to limiting refuge work and restricting public visitation. Another consequence is the end of 14-year tradition of the wildlife festival. Pelican Island will be losing its only public-use staff and eliminating all active outreach at the nation&#x27;s first wildlife refuge. Pelican Island Refuge manager and project leader Paul Tritaik said in 2006 that reductions to a full-time staff would lead to the end of some refuge activities and the loss of several trails.

== Physical environment ==

The environment of Pelican Island consists of climate, topography, geology, air quality, and waterways.

=== Climate ===

The climate at Pelican Island NWR is subtropical and temperate and experiences an average temperate of . Pelican Island has long, warm, and humid summers and short, mild winters and has an average rainfall of about annually. Pelican Island may experience tropical storms in the period from May to November.

=== Topography ===

The elevation of Pelican Island changes from east to west. It rises sharply from sea level to about and then drops back down more slowly to below sea level in the Indian River Lagoon. The land between the Indian River Lagoon and St. Sebastian River is . Even further west, there is an ancient dune that rises in elevation from to .

=== Geology ===

The landscape of Pelican Island area is made of Pleistocene (glacial) and Holocene (recent) origin. Submerged lands were exposed during the late Pleistocene period, allowing for the spread of flora and fauna from the peninsula. Wetlands, salt marshes, mangroves, and other swampy formations make up the uplands and submerged lands.

==== Soil ====
&quot;The general soils in the Pelican Island Refuge are Canaveral-Captiva-Palm Beach, which is characterized by the gently sloping, somewhat poorly drained to moderately drained sandy soils with shell fragments, and McKee-Quartzipsamments-St. Augustine, which is characterized by level, somewhat poorly drained soils mixed with sand and shell fragments.&quot; Other soils include Canaveral Fine Sand, Quartzipsamments, Captiva Fine Sand, McKee Mucky Clay Loam, and Kesson Muck.

=== Air quality ===

Good air quality is vital for the refuge to maintain itself. A few problems dealing with air pollution are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. The primary producers of these pollutants are vehicle emissions, power plants, and industrial activities. The Indian River Lagoon area is said to have good air quality. Sometimes occasional temperate increases can temporarily degrade the air quality below the accepted levels.

=== Waterways ===

The Indian River Lagoon stretches from Ponce de Leon south of Daytona Beach to Jupiter Inlet near West Palm Beach, a distance of about , and contains a number of small rivers, creeks, and canals. The Intracoastal Waterway is the deepest part of the Lagoon. St. Sebastian River and Turkey Creek provide freshwater to the Lagoon. Water quality is also a concern in the refuge: cadmium, lead, mercury, nutrients, selenium, thallium, and dissolved oxygen. The water circulation is affected by the Intracoastal Waterway, winds, inlets, and causeways. Within the refuge boundary, the water quality is generally better compared to portions of the Lagoon.

== Wildlife ==

Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds hundreds of species of animals including birds, fish, plants, and mammals. The wetlands of Pelican Island are a major ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity. Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon. Of the endangered species, West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon. Around the lagoon in the refuge are two wood stork refuges. These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population. Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans, great egrets, snowy egrets, reddish egrets, great blue heron, little blue heron, tricolored heron, black-crowned night heron, American white ibis, glossy ibis, double-crested cormorant, anhinga, and American oystercatcher.

===Visiting===

Pelican Island is only accessible by boat or chartered tours. Nesting birds are easily disturbed, so people are not allowed to get too close or to disembark. Visiting during nesting season (late November through late July), one can expect to see brown pelican, wood storks, white ibises, black-crowned night herons, double-crested cormorants, reddish, snowy, and great egrets, and great blue, little blue and tricolored herons. Traveling in the winter, look for lesser scaup, blue-winged teal, mottled ducks, great northern divers, laughing gulls, American white pelicans, and red-breasted mergansers. Summer visitors should watch for roseate spoonbills, magnificent frigatebirds and least terns. Pelican Island also features some marine life in the Indian River including sea turtles, dolphins, and manatees.

New public facilities were opened and dedicated on March 14, 2003, in ceremonies marking the centennial of Pelican Island and the National Wildlife Refuge System. A 37¢ US Commemorative Stamp in honor of the NWR Centennial was issued as part of the celebration. The new facilities include a 1/4 mile boardwalk and observation tower to view Pelican Island, two salt marsh impoundment foot trails, interpretive signs, informational kiosks, restrooms and parking areas. The facilities are west of Highway A1A on the north end of Historic Jungle Trail. They were produced through a partnership with Indian River County, St. Johns River Water Management District, Florida Inland Navigation District, Florida Power and Light, ConocoPhillips, Wild Birds Unlimited, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and many others. Future plans include additional boardwalks, an overlook, a photo blind and a wildlife drive.

===Jungle Trail===

The historic Jungle Trail is a sandy road with a section that goes through the refuge. Citrus growers originally built this road in the 1920s and it is now on the National Register of Historic Places.
