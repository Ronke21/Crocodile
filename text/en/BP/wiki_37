<text>Quercus macrocarpa, the bur oak or burr oak, is a species of oak tree native to eastern North America. It is in the white oak section, &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Quercus&quot;, and is also called mossycup oak, mossycup white oak, blue oak, or scrub oak. The acorns are the largest of any North American oak (thus the species name &quot;macrocarpa&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;large&quot; and &quot;fruit&quot;), and are important food for wildlife.

==Description==
&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; is a large deciduous tree growing up to , rarely , in height, and is one of the most massive oaks with a trunk diameter of up to . It is one of the slowest-growing oaks, with a growth rate of per year when young. However, one source states that a well-established tree can grow up to per year. A 20-year-old tree will be about tall if grown in full sun. Naturally occurring saplings in forests will typically be older. Bur oaks commonly get to be 200 to 300 years old, and may live up to 400 years. The bark is gray with distinct vertical ridges.

The leaves are long and broad, variable in shape, with a lobed margin. Most often, the basal two-thirds is narrower and deeply lobed, while the apical third is wider and has shallow lobes or large teeth. They usually do not show strong fall color, although fine golden hues are occasionally seen. The flowers are greenish-yellow catkins, produced in the spring. The acorns are very large, long and broad, having a large cup that wraps much of the way around the nut, with large overlapping scales and often a fringe at the edge of the cup.

The wood when sawn transversely shows the characteristic annual rings formed by secondary thickening.

Bur oak is sometimes confused with other members of the white oak section, such as &quot;Quercus bicolor&quot; (swamp white oak), &quot;Quercus lyrata&quot; (overcup oak), and &quot;Quercus alba&quot; (white oak). It hybridises with several other species of oaks.

== Varieties ==
Two varieties are accepted in Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online:
*&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; var. &quot;macrocarpa&quot;
*&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; var. &quot;depressa&quot; 

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; is widespread in the Atlantic coastal plain from New Brunswick to North Carolina, west as far as Alberta, eastern Montana, Wyoming, and northeastern New Mexico. The vast majority of the populations are found in the eastern Great Plains, the Mississippi–Missouri–Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes region.

Bur oaks primarily grow in a temperate climate on the western oak–hickory forested regions in the United States and into Canada. It commonly grows in the open, away from dense forest canopy. For this reason, it is an important tree on the eastern prairies, often found near waterways in otherwise more forested areas, where there is a break in the canopy. It is drought resistant, possibly because of its long taproot. At the end of the growing season, a one-year sapling may have a taproot deep and a lateral root spread of . The West Virginia state champion bur oak has a trunk diameter of almost .

Large bur oaks, older than 12 years, are fire-tolerant because of their thick bark. One of the bur oak&#x27;s most common habitats, especially in Midwestern United States, is the oak savanna, where fires often occurred in early spring or late fall. Without fires, bur oak is often succeeded by other tree and shrub species that are more shade-tolerant. Older bur oaks may survive in dense woodlands for 80 years, until they are weakened by wood-rot fungi in the lower branches killed by shade, and by 100 to 110 years, they are often snapped by wind storms.

==Ecology==
The acorns are the largest of any North American oak and are an important wildlife food; American black bears sometimes tear off branches to get them. However, heavy nut crops are borne only every few years. In this evolutionary strategy, known as masting, the large seed crop every few years overwhelms the ability of seed predators to eat the acorns, thus ensuring the survival of some seeds. Other wildlife, such as deer and porcupine, eat the leaves, twigs and bark. Cattle are heavy browsers in some areas. The bur oak is the only known host plant of &quot;Bucculatrix recognita&quot; caterpillars.

Many species of arthropods form galls on the leaves and twigs, including &quot;Aceria querci&quot; (a mite) and numerous cynipid wasps: &quot;Acraspis macrocarpae&quot;, &quot;Acraspis villosa&quot;, &quot;Andricus chinquapin&quot;, &quot;Andricus dimorphus&quot;, &quot;Andricus foliaformis&quot;, &quot;Andricus flavohirtus&quot;, &quot;Andricus quercuspetiolicola&quot;, &quot;Callirhytis flavipes&quot;, &quot;Disholcaspis quercusmamma&quot;, &quot;Neuroterus floccosus&quot;, &quot;Neuroterus saltarius&quot;, &quot;Neuroterus umbilicatus&quot;, &quot;Philonix nigra&quot;, and &quot;Phylloteras poculum&quot;.

===Diseases===
Bur oak blight is caused by a fungal pathogen &quot;Tubakia iowensis&quot;. It forms black pustules on the petioles and causes leaf discoloration and death, making the tree more susceptible to other secondary issues such as &quot;Armillaria&quot; root rot or &quot;Agrilus bilineatus&quot; (two-lined chestnut borer).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; is cultivated by plant nurseries for use in gardens, in parks, and on urban sidewalks. Among the white oaks, it is one of the most tolerant of urban conditions, and is one of the fastest-growing of the group. It has been planted in many climates, ranging northwards to Anchorage, Alaska, and as far south as Mission, Texas. It withstands chinook conditions in Calgary, Alberta. It is drought tolerant.

Coppicing has been shown to produce superior growth.

==Uses==

The wood of &quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot; is commercially valuable; it is durable, used for flooring, fence posts, cabinets, and barrels. The acorns can be eaten boiled and raw. Native Americans have used the astringent bark to treat wounds, sores, rashes, and diarrhea. 

==Culture==
Many places are named after the burr oak, such as Burr Oak State Park in Ohio, the cities of Burr Oak, Iowa and Burr Oak, Kansas, and the village of Burr Oak, Michigan. &quot;Burr Oaks&quot; (1947) is a volume of poetry by Richard Eberhart.

<text>Caldicot () is a market town and community in Monmouthshire, Wales. The town is located between Chepstow and the city of Newport. The site adjoins the Caldicot Levels, on the north side of the Severn Estuary. The population of the built-up area was around 11,000. It has a large school, Caldicot School, and is known for its medieval castle. The built-up area includes Portskewett. Caldicot had a population of 9,604 in 2011.

==History==
There was considerable activity in the area during the Bronze Age. Excavations near the Nedern Brook beside the castle revealed a plank from a boat and complex wooden structures in the former river bed. The boat probably traded across the Severn with the farmers and traders of Somerset. Later, in Roman times, it is likely that trading vessels sailed up the Nedern Brook to Caerwent. The discovery of kilns also shows that coarse pottery was produced in the village during Roman times.

The name &#x27;Caldicot&#x27; is usually stated to derive from the Old English phrase &quot;calde cot&quot; meaning &#x27;cold hut&#x27;. A cold hut is an exposed shelter used by either humans or animals. The modern Welsh name, &quot;Cil-y-coed&quot;, meaning &quot;corner of the wood&quot;, referring to Wentwood, was proposed by the 19th-century lexicographer William Owen Pughe as the origin of the English name, but his hypothesis has been discredited. The modern use of this form has been described as a &quot;very recent innovation&quot;.

In 1074, following the Norman Conquest, the manor of Caldicot was given to Durand, the Sheriff of Gloucester. Caldicot was recorded in Gloucestershire by the Domesday Book in 1086. Its entry reads, &quot;Durand the Sheriff holds of the King, one land, in Caerwent, called Caldicot. He has in demesne there 3 ploughs, and 15 half villeins, and 4 bondmen, and one knight. All these have twelve ploughs. There is a mill worth ten shillings.&quot;

One of the oldest buildings in Caldicot, Llanthony Secunda Manor, was built around 1120 as a grange for monks from Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucester.

In 1158 the manor of Caldicot passed to Humphrey II de Bohun, who was responsible for building the stone keep and curtain walls of the present-day castle. In 1376 it passed to Thomas Woodstock, third son of King Edward III, when he married Alianore de Bohun. It began to fall into ruins around the 16th century.

Caldicot is one of the few villages to appear on the &quot;Cambriae Typus&quot; map of 1573.

By the mid-19th century, Caldicot was a small farming village. However, the opening of the South Wales Railway brought London and Cardiff within relatively easy reach (although Caldicot station itself was not opened until 1936). The railway attracted industry, and 1862 Henry Hughes of Tintern opened a wireworks next to the railway, becoming the village&#x27;s major employer and attracting many new workers. In 1880 it became a tinplate works for the canning industry. In 1879 work began on the Severn Tunnel, which was opened in 1886. Its construction brought hundreds of workers to Caldicot, roughly doubling its population.

Court House was the home of the baker Henry Jones, the inventor of self-raising flour, from 1864 until his death in 1891. He is buried in the churchyard.

During the first half of the 20th century, Caldicot continued to grow steadily, but unspectacularly, reaching a population of 1,770 in 1951. Early in the 1950s, however, Chepstow Rural District Council decided that the village should be allowed to expand to approximately 3,000. Shortly after this decision, the government decided to build a new steelworks at Llanwern. Caldicot was designated as a suitable home for the thousands of steelworkers, and expansion plans were revised upwards. Llanwern steelworks opened in 1962, and by the end of the decade Caldicot had over 7,000 residents.

The growth of the community was furthered by the opening of the Severn Bridge in 1966. With Caldicot now being part of the &quot;M4 corridor&quot; new businesses, such as the telecommunication company Mitel, came to the town, compensating for the contraction of the steel industry and the railways.

==Religion==

The parish church of St Mary, also called St Mary Virgin Church, is a Church in Wales parish church. There is evidence that the church has pre-Norman foundations; however, the earliest part of the building dates from the 14th century. It is a Grade I listed building. It is mainly built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th and 15th centuries.

==Education==

Caldicot School was substantially rebuilt and the new buildings opened in September 2017. It will house all subject departments in one single building. The project was part of the Welsh Government&#x27;s &quot;21st Century Schools &amp; Education Capital Programme&quot;. The new building has capacity for 1,500 pupils and was to cost £31million which then rose to £34.9 million. By October 2016, the total cost was said to have risen to £40.175 million.

==Governance==
Caldicot Town Council comprises seventeen elected or co-opted town councillors, from five community wards, namely Castle, Dewstow, Green Lane, Severn and West End. Caldicot Castle, Dewstow, Green Lane, Severn and West End are also county wards to Monmouthshire County Council, each electing one county councillor.

==Attractions and amenities==

Caldicot is the location of Caldicot Castle and lake. The area has popular waymarked footpaths along the Caldicot Levels and the coastal path can be walked. Nearby are Caerwent and Wentwood. To the north-west, Dewstow House dates from c.1804. Extensive gardens and grottoes built after 1895 have been undergoing restoration since 2000 and are now open to the public.

Five primary schools are located in the area, two of which were created from local Infant and Junior Schools. Durand Primary (with nursery), Ysgol Gymraeg Y Ffin (Welsh-medium education provision for south Monmouthshire), Castle Park Primary (formed from Sandy Lane Infant School and St Mary&#x27;s Juniors), Dewstow Primary (formally of West End Infants and Green Lane Juniors) and ARW (Archbishop Rowan Williams Church of Wales Primary School) in Portskewett. Caldicot is the nearest town to the Welsh side opening of the Severn railway tunnel, although the nearest station serving the line through the tunnel, Severn Tunnel Junction, is at Rogiet, a village which was developed in modern times largely to service the railway. Caldicot library was built in 1995. Caldicot Leisure Centre has a sports centre, one of four leisure centres in Monmouthshire. Its facilities include an indoor swimming pool, squash courts and both indoor and outdoor games pitches, and a gym. The Leisure Centre is located next to Caldicot School. A new astroturf pitch was built before 2013.

==Transport==
Caldicot station on the Gloucester–Newport line serves the town, with services to cities like Newport, Cardiff and Gloucester as well to Bristol. Transport by road allows access to the M4 / M48 motorway. There is also access by road across the Second Severn Crossing and Severn Bridge to Bristol and South England.

==Twinning==
Caldicot is twinned with Waghäusel, Germany and Morières-lès-Avignon France.

<doc id="473498" wikidata="Q6542448" url="?curid=473498" title="Librarian of Congress">
<text>The librarian of Congress is the head of the Library of Congress, appointed by the president of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, for a term of ten years. The librarian of Congress also appoints and oversees the Register of Copyrights of the U.S. Copyright Office and has broad responsibilities around copyright, extending to electronic resources and fair use provisions outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The librarian determines whether particular works are subject to DMCA prohibitions regarding technological access protection. In addition, the librarian appoints the U.S. poet laureate and awards the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.

On July 13, 2016, the US Senate confirmed President Barack Obama&#x27;s nomination of Carla Hayden as the librarian, and she was sworn in on September 14, 2016.

== History ==
On April 24, 1800, the 6th United States Congress passed an appropriations bill signed by President John Adams which created the Library of Congress. This law was to serve a &quot;further provision for the removal and accommodation of the Government of the United States&quot;. The fifth section of the act specifically created the Library of Congress and designated some of its early capabilities. The act provided for &quot;the acquisition of books for congressional use, a suitable place in the Capitol in which to house them, a joint committee to make rules for their selection, acquisition, and circulation&quot;, as well as an appropriation of $5,000 for the new library.

In 1802, two years after the creation of the library, President Thomas Jefferson approved a congressional act that created the Office of the Librarian and granted the president power of appointment over the new office. Shortly thereafter, Jefferson appointed his former campaign manager John J. Beckley to serve as the first librarian of Congress. He was paid $2 a day and was also required to serve as clerk to the House of Representatives. It was not until 1897 that Congress was given the power to confirm the president&#x27;s nominee. This same law gave the librarian the sole power for making the institution&#x27;s rules and appointing the library&#x27;s staff.

Up until the nomination of Herbert Putnam in 1899 under President McKinley, all previous librarians lacked any prior experience in the profession of librarianship; these librarians had held roles in journalism, law, writing, publishing, and politics. Even to this day, only three librarians – four including acting librarian David S. Mao in 2015 – have worked in the librarian field, despite several instances of opposition from the American Library Association.

== Appointment, term length, and salary ==
From its creation until 2015, the post of the librarian was not subject to term limits and allowed incumbents to maintain a lifetime appointment once confirmed. Most librarians of Congress have served until death or retirement. There were only 13 librarians of Congress in the more than two centuries from 1802 to 2015, and the library &quot;enjoyed a continuity of atmosphere and of policy that is rare in national institutions&quot;. In 2015, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed into law the &quot;Librarian of Congress Succession Modernization Act of 2015&quot;, which put a 10-year term limit on the position with an option for reappointment. The legislation was seen as a critique of Librarian James H. Billington&#x27;s unwillingness to hire a permanent chief information officer to effectively manage and update the library&#x27;s information technology.

According to Section 136-1 of Title 2 of the U.S.C., the Librarian of Congress shall be appointed to office by a nomination from the president and the advice and consent of the Senate. The librarian may then serve for a term of 10 years and be reappointed to the post with the same procedure. The Librarian of Congress shall be compensated for his/her services with the equivalent of the rate of pay set by Level II of the Executive Schedule.

== Authority and duties ==
There are no laws or regulations delineating qualifications for the office holder. The position of librarian of Congress has been held by candidates of different backgrounds, interests, and talents, throughout its history. Politicians, businessmen, authors, poets, lawyers, and professional librarians have served as the Librarian of Congress. However, at various times there have been proposals for requirements for the position. In 1945, Carl Vitz, then president of the American Library Association, wrote a letter to the president of the United States regarding the position of librarian of Congress, which had recently become vacant. Vitz felt it necessary to recommend potential librarians. Vitz stated the position &quot;requires a top-flight administrator, a statesman-like leader in the world of knowledge, and an expert in bringing together the materials of scholarship and organizing them for use—in short, a distinguished librarian&quot;. In 1989, Congressman Major Owens (D–NY) introduced a bill to set stricter requirements for who may be appointed. He argued appointed librarians need to have specialized training; the bill did not become law.

<doc id="473503" wikidata="Q1241279" url="?curid=473503" title="Orthoptics">
<text>Orthoptics is a profession allied to the eye care profession. Orthoptists are the experts in diagnosing and treating defects in eye movements and problems with how the eyes work together, called binocular vision. These can be caused by issues with the muscles around the eyes or defects in the nerves enabling the brain to communicate with the eyes. Orthoptists are responsible for the diagnosis and non-surgical management of strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (lazy eye) and eye movement disorders. The word &quot;orthoptics&quot; comes from the Greek words ὀρθός &quot;orthos&quot;, &quot;straight&quot; and ὀπτικός &quot;optikοs&quot;, &quot;relating to sight&quot; and much of the practice of orthoptists concerns disorders of binocular vision and defects of eye movement. Orthoptists are trained professionals who specialize in orthoptic treatment, such as eye patches, eye exercises, prisms or glasses. They commonly work with paediatric patients and also adult patients with neurological conditions such as stroke, brain tumours or multiple sclerosis. With specific training, in some countries orthoptists may be involved in monitoring of some forms of eye disease, such as glaucoma, cataract screening and diabetic retinopathy.

==Effectiveness==
For children, there is evidence that orthoptics is more effective at treating convergence insufficiency than home-based pencil or computer training; for adults the effectiveness is less evident.

==History==
Orthoptics has a long history in supporting ophthalmic care. French ophthalmologist Louis Emile Javal began using ocular exercises to treat strabismus (squint) and described the practice of orthoptics in his writings in the late 19th century. Mary Maddox pioneered the orthoptic profession and was the first documented orthoptist. She was trained by her father, Ernest E. Maddox, in response to increasing patient demand and time needed to examine and treat patients. Ernest Maddox was a reputed ophthalmologist as well as the inventor of various instruments for investigating binocular vision. Mary Maddox started her own practice in London in the early 1920s and her first hospital clinic opened at the Royal Westminster Hospital in 1928. The first Australian hospital clinic with orthoptists was established at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1931.

==Current orthoptic practice==
Orthoptists are mainly involved with diagnosing and managing patients with binocular vision disorders which relate to amblyopia, eye movement disorders, extraocular muscle balance such as with version, refractive errors, vergence, accommodation imbalances, positive relative accommodation and negative relative accommodation. They work closely with ophthalmologists to ensure that patients with eye muscle disorders are offered a full range of treatment options. According to the International Orthoptic Association, professional orthoptic practice involves the following:
*Primary activities
**Ocular motility diagnosis and co-management
**Vision screening. In the UK all school vision screening programmes for children between age 4–5 years is orthoptic led. Screening is either conducted by orthoptists or by health professionals who have received extensive training and certification from their local orthoptic department.
**Assessment of special needs
**Assessment and rehabilitation in neurological disorders
*Secondary activities
**Low vision assessment and management
**Glaucoma assessment and stable glaucoma management
**Biometry (includes sonography work)
**Fundus photography and screening
**Visual electrodiagnosis
**Retinoscopy and refraction, such as using a phoropter to assess refractive errors
*Further activities
**Specific outpatient waiting list initiatives to reduce the delay for children referred to the eye clinic (filter screening)
**Joint multidisciplinary children&#x27;s vision screening clinics (orthoptics/optometry)
**Organisation/prioritisation of the strabismus surgical admissions list according to agreed criteria
**Assistance with surgical procedures

== Qualifications and training ==
In the US, students of orthoptics must attend two years of fellowship training. , there were thirteen programs affiliated with medical facilities or universities in the US and three in Canada offering an orthoptic curriculum.
In the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland and Germany, the orthoptic degree is a full time three-year course, including hospital placements to develop and refine clinical skills and specialism.

Admission criteria vary from school to school; however, national regulations require completion of a baccalaureate degree prior to sitting for the national certifying exams. A personal interview is customarily part of the admissions process. In the UK the majority of orthoptists are employed by the NHS in hospitals or community eye services. They contribute to the wider eye care teams, alongside ophthalmologists and optometrists.

<text>Selonian was an East Baltic language, which was spoken by the East Baltic tribe of the Selonians, who until the 15th century lived in Selonia, a territory in southeastern Latvia and northeastern Lithuania. The language persisted until the 16th century.

==History==
Traces of the Selonian language can still be found in the territories the Selonians inhabited, especially in the accent and phonetics of the so-called Selonian dialect of the Latvian language. There are some traces of the Selonian language in the northeastern sub-dialects of the Aukštaitian dialect of the Lithuanian language, mostly in the lexicon.

==Classification==
It is considered that the Selonian language retained the Proto-Baltic sonorant diphthongs *an, *en, *in, *un like the Lithuanian language, but like the Latvian language the Proto-Baltic , changed to c, dz, and the Proto-Baltic *š, *ž changed to s, z.

<text>William Tanner Vollmann (born July 28, 1959) is an American novelist, journalist, war correspondent, short story writer, and essayist. He won the 2005 National Book Award for Fiction with the novel &quot;Europe Central&quot;.

==Biography==
Vollmann was born in Los Angeles and lived there for five years. He attended public high school in Bloomington, Indiana, and has also lived in New Hampshire, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area. His father was Thomas E. Vollmann, a business professor at Indiana University. When he was nine years old, Vollmann&#x27;s six-year-old sister drowned in a pond while under his supervision, and he felt responsible for her death. According to him, this loss has influenced much of his work.

Vollmann studied at Deep Springs College, and completed a BA, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in comparative literature at Cornell University, where he lived at the Telluride House.

After graduation, Vollmann went on to the University of California, Berkeley, on a fellowship for a doctoral program in comparative literature. He dropped out after one year.

Vollmann lives in Sacramento, California, with his wife, who is a radiation oncologist. In 2022, Vollmann&#x27;s daughter Lisa died of complications from alcoholism.

==Career==
Vollmann worked odd jobs, including a post as a secretary at an insurance company, and saved up enough money to go to Afghanistan in 1982. During this trip, he sought to gather information and images that could determine the most deserving candidates for American aid. He eventually foisted himself upon a group of &quot;mujahideen&quot; heading for the front lines. He saw battle with the soldiers, who were fighting the Soviet Union, before he came down with dysentery and had to be dragged through the Hindu Kush mountains. His experiences on this trip inspired his first non-fiction book, &quot;An Afghanistan Picture Show, or, How I Saved the World,&quot; which was not published until 1992.

Upon his return to the US, Vollmann started work as a computer programmer, even though he had virtually no experience with computers. According to a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; profile by the novelist Madison Smartt Bell, for a year Vollmann wrote much of his first novel, &quot;You Bright and Risen Angels&quot;, after hours on office computers, subsisting on candy bars from vending machines and hiding from the janitorial staff.

His writing influences include Ernest Hemingway, Comte de Lautréamont, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata, and Leo Tolstoy.

In addition to full-length books, Vollmann has written articles and had stories published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Conjunctions&quot;, &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Gear&quot;, and &quot;Granta.&quot; He has also contributed to &quot;The New York Times Book Review.&quot; Vollmann identifies as a &quot;hack journalist&quot;; he often does travel writing and reportage while doing research for his larger fiction or non-fiction projects.

In November 2003 (after many delays), his book &quot;Rising Up and Rising Down&quot; was published. It is a 3,300-page, heavily illustrated, seven-volume treatise on violence. It was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award. A single-volume condensed version was published at the end of the following year by Ecco Press. Vollmann&#x27;s sole justification for the abridgment was that he &quot;did it for the money.&quot; &quot;Rising Up and Rising Down&quot; represents more than 20 years of work in which he tries to establish a moral calculus to consider the causes, effects, and ethics of violence. Vollmann based it on his reporting from places of warfare, including Cambodia, Somalia, and Iraq.

Vollmann&#x27;s other works often deal with the settlement of North America (as in &quot;Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes&quot;, a cycle of seven novels); or stories of people (often prostitutes) on the margins of war, poverty, and hope. His novel &quot;Europe Central&quot; (2005) follows the trajectories of a wide range of characters (including the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich) caught up in the fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union. It won the 2005 National Book Award for Fiction.

In 2008, Vollmann was awarded a five-year Strauss Living Award, which provides $50,000 a year, tax free, to allow writers to dedicate their time solely to writing. In 2009, Vollmann published &quot;Imperial,&quot; a nonfiction account of life in Imperial County, California, on the border of Mexico.

In 2010, Vollmann published a critical study of Japanese Noh theater entitled &quot;Kissing the Mask: Beauty, Understatement, and Femininity in Japanese Noh Theater&quot;.

In 2008, as part of an exploration of prostitution and transgenderism, Vollmann began cross dressing and developed a female alter ego named Dolores, which is documented in &quot;The Book of Dolores&quot;. &quot;&#x27;Dolores is a relatively young woman trapped in this fat, aging male body,&#x27; Mr. Vollmann said. &#x27;I’ve bought her a bunch of clothes, but she&#x27;s not grateful. She would like to get rid of me if she could.&#x27;&quot;

As early as 2007 Vollmann was writing ghost and supernatural stories—(&quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot; was published in &quot;AGNI&quot; no. 66 in 2007).—which were eventually published by Viking as &quot;Last Stories and Other Stories&quot;. In interviews, he has mentioned a book about abortion called &quot;The Shame of Our Youth,&quot; as well as a study on rape cases in court.

Vollmann&#x27;s papers were acquired by the Rare Books &amp; Manuscripts Library of Ohio State University.

In his personal life, Vollmann – who eschews not only the fame of authorship but also cellphones, credit cards, and other modern age touchstones – has sometimes been characterized as a misanthrope, even a Luddite. In a 2013 &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; essay, &quot;Life as a Terrorist&quot;, Vollmann revealed how the perception of &quot;anti-progress, anti-industrialist themes&quot; in his early writings had changed his life. Utilizing official files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the essay details Vollmann&#x27;s investigation by the FBI as a suspect in the mid-1990s Unabomber case. Though he was cleared, Vollmann describes a lifetime of unabating negative repercussions from his permanent classified record.

==Studies==
Full-length critical essays about Vollmann&#x27;s work have been published in &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction, Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction, BookForum,&quot; &quot;Open Letters Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Science Fiction Studies.&quot; In 2010, the German magazine &quot;032c&quot; dedicated 40 pages of its 19th issue to Vollmann, and featured a rare interview with the author in addition to reprinted texts.

Michael Hemmingson co-edited, with Larry McCaffery, &quot;Expelled from Eden: A WTV Reader&quot; (NY: Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press, 2004) and published &quot;William T. Vollmann: A Critical Study and Seven Interviews&quot; (Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co) in 2009.

&quot;William T. Vollmann: A Critical Companion&quot;, edited by Christopher K. Coffman and Daniel Lukes, and including contributions from Larry McCaffery, Jonathan Franzen, Michael Hemmingson, James Franco, Carla Bolte, and others, was published by the University of Delaware in October 2014. &quot;Conversations with William T. Vollmann&quot;, edited by Daniel Lukes, and including pieces by Jonathan Coe, Dennis Cooper, and Donna Seaman, was published by University Press of Mississippi in January 2020.

<doc id="473514" wikidata="Q1057607" url="?curid=473514" title="Generalized coordinates">
<text>In analytical mechanics, generalized coordinates are a set of parameters used to represent the state of a system in a configuration space. These parameters must uniquely define the configuration of the system relative to a reference state. The generalized velocities are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates of the system. The adjective &quot;generalized&quot; distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term &quot;coordinate&quot; to refer to Cartesian coordinates.

An example of a generalized coordinate would be to describe the position of a pendulum using the angle of the pendulum relative to vertical, rather than by the x and y position of the pendulum.

Although there may be many possible choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system, they are generally selected to simplify calculations, such as the solution of the equations of motion for the system. If the coordinates are independent of one another, the number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

Generalized coordinates are paired with generalized momenta to provide canonical coordinates on phase space.

==Constraints and degrees of freedom==


Generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system, which simplifies the formulation of Lagrange&#x27;s equations of motion. However, it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordinates may be &quot;dependent&quot;, which means that they are related by one or more constraint equations.

===Holonomic constraints===

For a system of particles in 3D real coordinate space, the position vector of each particle can be written as a 3-tuple in Cartesian coordinates:

:formula_1

Any of the position vectors can be denoted where labels the particles. A &quot;holonomic constraint&quot; is a &quot;constraint equation&quot; of the form for particle 

:formula_2

which connects all the 3 spatial coordinates of that particle together, so they are not independent. The constraint may change with time, so time will appear explicitly in the constraint equations. At any instant of time, any one coordinate will be determined from the other coordinates, e.g. if and are given, then so is . One constraint equation counts as &quot;one&quot; constraint. If there are constraints, each has an equation, so there will be constraint equations. There is not necessarily one constraint equation for each particle, and if there are no constraints on the system then there are no constraint equations.

So far, the configuration of the system is defined by quantities, but coordinates can be eliminated, one coordinate from each constraint equation. The number of independent coordinates is . (In dimensions, the original configuration would need coordinates, and the reduction by constraints means ). It is ideal to use the minimum number of coordinates needed to define the configuration of the entire system, while taking advantage of the constraints on the system. These quantities are known as generalized coordinates in this context, denoted . It is convenient to collect them into an -tuple

:formula_3

which is a point in the &quot;configuration space&quot; of the system. They are all independent of one other, and each is a function of time. Geometrically they can be lengths along straight lines, or arc lengths along curves, or angles; not necessarily Cartesian coordinates or other standard orthogonal coordinates. There is one for each degree of freedom, so the number of generalized coordinates equals the number of degrees of freedom, . A degree of freedom corresponds to one quantity that changes the configuration of the system, for example the angle of a pendulum, or the arc length traversed by a bead along a wire.

If it is possible to find from the constraints as many independent variables as there are degrees of freedom, these can be used as generalized coordinates. The position vector of particle is a function of all the generalized coordinates (and, through them, of time),

:formula_4

and the generalized coordinates can be thought of as parameters associated with the constraint.

The corresponding time derivatives of are the generalized velocities,

:formula_5

(each dot over a quantity indicates one time derivative). The velocity vector is the total derivative of with respect to time

:formula_6

and so generally depends on the generalized velocities and coordinates. Since we are free to specify the initial values of the generalized coordinates and velocities separately, the generalized coordinates and velocities can be treated as &quot;independent variables&quot;.

===Non-holonomic constraints===

A mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives. Constraints of this type are known as non-holonomic. First-order non-holonomic constraints have the form

:formula_7

An example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife-edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector. Non-holonomic constraints can also involve next-order derivatives such as generalized accelerations.

==Physical quantities in generalized coordinates==

===Kinetic energy===

The total kinetic energy of the system is the energy of the system&#x27;s motion, defined as

:formula_8

in which · is the dot product. The kinetic energy is a function only of the velocities , not the coordinates themselves. By contrast an important observation is

:formula_9

which illustrates the kinetic energy is in general a function of the generalized velocities, coordinates, and time if the constraints also vary with time, so .

In the case the constraints on the particles are time-independent, then all partial derivatives with respect to time are zero, and the kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree 2 in the generalized velocities.

Still for the time-independent case, this expression is equivalent to taking the line element squared of the trajectory for particle ,

:formula_10

and dividing by the square differential in time, , to obtain the velocity squared of particle . Thus for time-independent constraints it is sufficient to know the line element to quickly obtain the kinetic energy of particles and hence the Lagrangian.

It is instructive to see the various cases of polar coordinates in 2D and 3D, owing to their frequent appearance. In 2D polar coordinates ,

:formula_11

in 3D cylindrical coordinates ,

:formula_12

in 3D spherical coordinates ,

:formula_13

===Generalized momentum===

The &quot;generalized momentum&quot; &quot;canonically conjugate to&quot; the coordinate is defined by

:formula_14

If the Lagrangian does &quot;not&quot; depend on some coordinate , then it follows from the Euler–Lagrange equations that the corresponding generalized momentum will be a conserved quantity, because the time derivative is zero implying the momentum is a constant of the motion;

:formula_15

==Examples==

===Bead on a wire===

For a bead sliding on a frictionless wire subject only to gravity in 2d space, the constraint on the bead can be stated in the form , where the position of the bead can be written , in which is a parameter, the arc length along the curve from some point on the wire. This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only &quot;one&quot; coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of the bead can be parameterized by one number, , and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates and ; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the wire exerts on the bead to keep it on the wire, and the non-constraint applied force is gravity acting on the bead.

Suppose the wire changes its shape with time, by flexing. Then the constraint equation and position of the particle are respectively

:formula_16

which now both depend on time due to the changing coordinates as the wire changes its shape. Notice time appears implicitly via the coordinates &quot;and&quot; explicitly in the constraint equations.

===Simple pendulum===

The relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and Cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple pendulum.

A simple pendulum consists of a mass hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius . The position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector measured in the plane of the circle such that is in the vertical direction. The coordinates and are related by the equation of the circle
:formula_17
that constrains the movement of . This equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components,
:formula_18

Now introduce the parameter , that defines the angular position of from the vertical direction. It can be used to define the coordinates and , such that
:formula_19
The use of to define the configuration of this system avoids the constraint provided by the equation of the circle.

Notice that the force of gravity acting on the mass is formulated in the usual Cartesian coordinates,
:formula_20
where is the acceleration due to gravity.

The virtual work of gravity on the mass as it follows the trajectory is given by
:formula_21

The variation can be computed in terms of the coordinates and , or in terms of the parameter ,
:formula_22
Thus, the virtual work is given by
:formula_23

Notice that the coefficient of is the -component of the applied force. In the same way, the coefficient of is known as the generalized force along generalized coordinate , given by
:formula_24

To complete the analysis consider the kinetic energy of the mass, using the velocity,
:formula_25
so,
:formula_26

D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s form of the principle of virtual work for the pendulum in terms of the coordinates and are given by,
:formula_27
This yields the three equations
:formula_28
in the three unknowns, , and .

Using the parameter , those equations take the form
:formula_29
which becomes,
:formula_30
or
:formula_31
This formulation yields one equation because there is a single parameter and no constraint equation.

This shows that the parameter is a generalized coordinate that can be used in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates and to analyze the pendulum.

===Double pendulum===

The benefits of generalized coordinates become apparent with the analysis of a double pendulum.
For the two masses , let define their two trajectories. These vectors satisfy the two constraint equations,
:formula_32
and
:formula_33
The formulation of Lagrange&#x27;s equations for this system yields six equations in the four Cartesian coordinates and the two Lagrange multipliers that arise from the two constraint equations.

Now introduce the generalized coordinates that define the angular position of each mass of the double pendulum from the vertical direction. In this case, we have
:formula_34

The force of gravity acting on the masses is given by,
:formula_35
where is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the virtual work of gravity on the two masses as they follow the trajectories is given by
:formula_36

The variations can be computed to be
:formula_37

Thus, the virtual work is given by
:formula_38
and the generalized forces are
:formula_39

Compute the kinetic energy of this system to be
:formula_40

Euler–Lagrange equation yield two equations in the unknown generalized coordinates given by
:formula_41
and
:formula_42

The use of the generalized coordinates provides an alternative to the Cartesian formulation of the dynamics of the double pendulum.

===Spherical pendulum===

For a 3D example, a spherical pendulum with constant length free to swing in any angular direction subject to gravity, the constraint on the pendulum bob can be stated in the form

:formula_43

where the position of the pendulum bob can be written

:formula_44

in which are the spherical polar angles because the bob moves in the surface of a sphere. The position is measured along the suspension point to the bob, here treated as a point particle. A logical choice of generalized coordinates to describe the motion are the angles . Only two coordinates are needed instead of three, because the position of the bob can be parameterized by two numbers, and the constraint equation connects the three coordinates so any one of them is determined from the other two.

==Generalized coordinates and virtual work==
The &quot;principle of virtual work&quot; states that if a system is in static equilibrium, the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from this state, that is, for any variation . When formulated in terms of generalized coordinates, this is equivalent to the requirement that the generalized forces for any virtual displacement are zero, that is .

Let the forces on the system be be applied to points with Cartesian coordinates , then the virtual work generated by a virtual displacement from the equilibrium position is given by
:formula_45
where denote the virtual displacements of each point in the body.

Now assume that each depends on the generalized coordinates then
:formula_46
and
:formula_47

The terms
:formula_48
are the generalized forces acting on the system. Kane shows that these generalized forces can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives,
:formula_49
where is the velocity of the point of application of the force .

In order for the virtual work to be zero for an arbitrary virtual displacement, each of the generalized forces must be zero, that is
:formula_50

<text>The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is the first minister and head of government for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Since 1949, the premier&#x27;s duties and office has been the successor to the ministerial position of the prime minister of the former Dominion of Newfoundland. Before 2001, the official title was &quot;Premier of Newfoundland&quot;.

The premier is appointed by the lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, as representative of the King in Right of Newfoundland and Labrador. They are usually the leader of the party that commands a majority in the House of Assembly. The word &quot;premier&quot; is derived from the French word of the same spelling, meaning &quot;first&quot;; and ultimately from the Latin word &quot;primarius&quot;, meaning &quot;primary&quot;.

The current premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is Andrew Furey, since August 19, 2020. He currently represents Humber-Gros Morne in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly.

On February 25, 2025, Furey announced his intention to resign as premier and leader of the Liberal Party as soon as a successor is chosen.

==Formal responsibilities==
The responsibilities of the premier usually include:
* serving as the president of the Executive Council and head of the provincial Cabinet. The Executive Council is the formal name of the Cabinet when it is acting in its legal capacity.
* serving as the head of the provincial government
* leading the development and implementation of government policies and priorities
* serving as the senior communicator of government priorities and plans between:
** the lieutenant governor and Cabinet
** the Newfoundland and Labrador government and other provincial and territorial governments
** the Newfoundland and Labrador government and the federal government and international governments
* functions in respect of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, such as recommending to the lieutenant governor the appointment of cabinet ministers and allocating ministerial portfolios
* serving as leader of a major political party and its caucus of MHAs
* representing their constituency in the House of Assembly

==Office of the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador==

The Office of the Premier is located at the Confederation Building East Block. Staff at the office consists of:

* Director of Communications
* Special assistant (Strategic Communications)
* Special assistant (Communications)

<text>The premier of the Northwest Territories is the first minister and head of government for the Canadian territory of the Northwest Territories. The premier is the territory&#x27;s head of government, although the powers of the office are considerably less than those of a provincial premier.

Unlike provincial premiers, who are appointed by a lieutenant-governor on the basis of their leadership of a majority bloc in the legislature, the premier of the Northwest Territories is elected, along with the Cabinet, by the non-partisan members of the territory&#x27;s Legislative Assembly, in accordance with the system of consensus government, and then appointed by the commissioner of the Northwest Territories.

Before 1994, the term &quot;government leader&quot; was officially used instead of &quot;premier,&quot; but the title of premier was later retroactively applied to government leaders starting with George Braden in 1980, and had been in informal use for several years, based on the historical precedent set by Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, who used the title of premier of the North West Territories from 1897 to 1905 .

The current premier of the Northwest Territories is R. J. Simpson, since December 8, 2023.

<text>The premier of Nunavut (; Inuinnaqtun: &quot;Hivuliqti Nunavunmi&quot;; ) is the first minister for the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The premier is the territory&#x27;s head of government, although their powers are somewhat more limited than those of a provincial premier.

Unlike most other premiers who are officially appointed by a lieutenant governor or commissioner on account of their leadership of a majority bloc in the legislature, the premier, and the Cabinet, is directly elected by the non-partisan members of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, in accordance with the system of consensus government. The premier is formally appointed by the commissioner of Nunavut, who is bound to act on the Assembly&#x27;s recommendation by both the Nunavut Act and convention.

==History==
The territory&#x27;s first premier, Paul Okalik, was elected after the 1999 general elections. He was re-elected to a second term after the 2004 general elections. Although Okalik was re-elected to a third term after the 2008 general elections in the Iqaluit West riding, he was defeated by newly elected MLA Eva Aariak in the premiership vote on November 14. On 15 November, 2013, Peter Taptuna beat out Okalik and Paul Quassa for the position of premier. Quassa was elected in 2017 but lost a confidence vote in 2018 which led to the election of Joe Savikataaq. P.J. Akeeagok was selected to become premier in the Nunavut Leadership Forum on November 17, 2021 defeating Savikataaq.

<doc id="473524" wikidata="Q12270260" url="?curid=473524" title="Premier of Yukon">
<text>The premier of Yukon is the first minister and head of government for the Canadian territory of Yukon. The post is the territory&#x27;s head of government, although its powers are considerably more limited than that of a provincial premier. The office was established in 1978 when most authority was devolved from the appointed commissioner to the leader of the party that had the confidence of the Yukon Legislative Assembly; for the year immediately prior to this, that leader was one of the members serving with the commissioner&#x27;s Executive Committee (a Cabinet).

From the first conventional legislative elections in 1978 to 1989, the term &quot;government leader&quot; was used. Tony Penikett chose to change the title to premier for his 1989 to 1992 term amid some controversy. His successor, John Ostashek, returned to using government leader, as did Ostashek&#x27;s successor Piers McDonald. McDonald&#x27;s successor Pat Duncan made the decision to use the title premier upon taking office in 2000 and the title has since remained unchanged.

The current premier of Yukon is Ranj Pillai, leader of the Yukon Liberal Party. Pillai was formally sworn in as premier on January 14, 2023, leading a minority government.

<doc id="473525" wikidata="Q1566423" url="?curid=473525" title="Wheel series">
<text>A wheel series, wheel show, wheel format or umbrella series is a television series in which two or more regular programs are rotated in the same time slot. Sometimes the wheel series is given its own umbrella title and promoted as a single unit instead of promoting its separate components.

The most successful example of a wheel series on American television was the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;, which debuted in 1971 on NBC and ran for seven seasons. Three of the shows in the rotation, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, were among the most successful shows on American television in the 1970s.

==History==
The concept debuted in 1955 with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot;. &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; was a one-hour show rotating three series based on the movies &quot;King&#x27;s Row&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, with the last 10 minutes set aside for the segment, &quot;Behind The Cameras at Warner Brothers&quot;. Warner Bros. was inspired by the &quot;Disneyland&quot; anthology series to do the series for publicity. The series lasted for one season.

In 1959 ITV in the United Kingdom introduced &quot;The Four Just Men&quot;, a 39 episode series linking the common purpose of four characters: Jeff Ryder (Richard Conte), Tim Collier (Dan Dailey), Ben Manfred (Jack Hawkins) and Ricco Poccari (Vittorio De Sica). Each episode (after the first) featured a different principal, but frequently included one or more of the others.

In ABC&#x27;s &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; (1958-64) the two detectives would typically alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week, and a Jeff Spencer case the next.

In NBC&#x27;s &quot;90 Bristol Court&quot; (1964-65), three unrelated comedy programs set in the same place were shown consecutively in one evening. They were tied together by a single character, handyman Cliff Murdoch (Guy Raymond). 

NBC began working with the mystery crime drama wheel format in 1968 with the 90-minute &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. Based on the successful 1966 telefilm, &quot;Fame Is the Name of the Game&quot;, the first of the long-running &quot;World Premiere Movie&quot; series, it featured three main characters who worked for the same media corporation in different capacities, each character serving as a springboard for a different type of story. 

NBC launched a wheel show each year for the subsequent three years: &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, &quot;Four in One&quot; and &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;. &quot;McCloud&quot; became part of the foundation for the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; after the cancellation of &quot;Four in One&quot;. It was joined by two new shows, &quot;Columbo&quot; (derived from the 1968 NBC telefilm &quot;&quot;) and &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot;. The success of this wheel on Sunday nights eventually led to a sister wheel show airing on Wednesday nights; the original was retitled &quot;NBC Sunday Mystery Movie&quot; with the addition of a fourth program, &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, and the new wheel, &quot;NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot; debuted with four other new programs. None of the newer programs were as successful as the original three Sunday shows, except for the Wednesday program, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, which was spun off as a standalone hour-long series in 1977. Rival programs ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Men&quot;, and &quot;The New CBS Tuesday Night Movies&quot; did not last long either.

Attempts at reviving the format were made in 1989 with the &quot;Mystery Wheel of Adventure&quot;, a series of made-for-syndication TV movies including six installments of a new version of &quot;The Saint&quot;, in 1989-1990, with a format that rotated new editions of &quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;Kojak&quot; on ABC, and in 1993-1994 on NBC, with a format that rotated &quot;A Perry Mason Mystery&quot; and new installments of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, without lasting success.

Hallmark Channel had success with its &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; wheel from 2005 to 2008, discontinuing the series amid the growing popularity of its original romance movies. In 2015, its newly-rebranded sister channel Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries launched a new mystery wheel.

<text>Video game design is the process of designing the rules and content of video games in the pre-production stage and designing the gameplay, environment, storyline and characters in the production stage. Some common video game design subdisciplines are world design, level design, system design, content design, and user interface design. Within the video game industry, video game design is usually just referred to as &quot;game design&quot;, which is a more general term elsewhere.

The video game designer is like the director of a film; the designer is the visionary of the game and controls the artistic and technical elements of the game in fulfillment of their vision. However, with complex games, such as MMORPGs or a big budget action or sports title, designers may number in the dozens. In these cases, there are generally one or two principal designers and multiple junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game. As the industry has aged and embraced alternative production methodologies such as agile, the role of a principal game designer has begun to separate - some studios emphasizing the auteur model while others emphasizing a more team oriented model. In larger companies like Electronic Arts, each aspect of the game (control, level design) may have a separate producer, lead designer and several general designers.

Video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as sometimes including writing skills. Historically, video game programmers have sometimes comprised the entire design team. This is the case of such noted designers as Sid Meier, John Romero, Chris Sawyer and Will Wright. A notable exception to this policy was Coleco, which from its very start separated the function of design and programming. As video games became more complex, computers and consoles became more powerful, the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer. Soon, game complexity demanded team members focused on game design. A number of early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others.

== Overview ==
Video game design starts with an idea, often a variation or modification on an existing concept. The game idea will fall within one or several genres and designers will often experiment with mixing genres. The game designer usually produces an initial game proposal document containing the concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, staff and budget estimates.

Multiple design decisions are made during the course of a game&#x27;s development; it is the responsibility of the designer to decide which elements should be implemented. For example, consistency with the game&#x27;s vision, budget or hardware limitations. Design changes will have a significant impact on required resources.

The designer may use scripting languages to implement and preview design ideas without necessarily modifying the game&#x27;s codebase. A game designer often plays video games and demos to follow the markets&#x27; development.

Over time, it has become common for a game designer&#x27;s name to misleadingly be given an undue amount of association to the game, neglecting the rest of the development team. This is in stark contrast to the industries&#x27; origins, when creators were often given little to no recognition. Coincidentally, this lack of credit lead Warren Robinett to create the first Easter egg in a video game.

Funding, traditionally provided by game publishers, who may have specific expectations from a game, must be taken into account, as most video games are &quot;market-driven&quot; — developed to sell for profit. However, if financial issues do not influence designer&#x27;s decisions, the game can become &quot;design-&quot; or &quot;designer-driven&quot;; but few games are designed this way, with it becoming more common among indie game developers, alongside alternative sources of funding, like Early Access or Crowdfunding. Alternatively, a game may be &quot;technology-driven&quot;, such as Quake (1996), to show off a particular hardware achievement or to market the game engine. Finally, a game may be &quot;art-driven&quot;, such as &quot;Myst&quot; (1993) and Journey (2012), mainly to show off impressive visuals designed by artists.

In &quot;Rules of Play&quot; (2004), Katie Salen and Eric Zimmermann write:
== Game designer ==

A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game. Multiple designers start their career in testing departments, other roles in game development or in classroom conditions, where mistakes by others can be seen first-hand.

* Lead designer coordinates the work of other designers and is the main visionary of the game. Lead designer ensures team communication, makes large design decisions and presents design outside of the team. Often the lead designer is technically and artistically astute. Keeping well-presented documentation also falls within the lead designer responsibilities. Lead designer may be the founder of a game development company or a promoted employee.
* Game mechanics designer or systems designer designs and balances the game&#x27;s rules.
* Level designer or environment designer is a position becoming prominent in recent years. Level designer is the person responsible for creating game environment, levels and missions.
* Planner is a term referring to a game designer in the Japanese video game industry, where game designers are typically credited as planners.

=== Compensation ===

In 2010, a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of US$65,000 ( sterling), () with three to six years of experience and $44,000 () with less than 3 years of experience. Lead designers earned $75,000 () with three to six years of experience and $95,000 () with more than six years of experience. In 2013, a game designer with less than 3 years of experience earned, on average, $55,000 (). A game designer with more than 6 years of experience made, on average, $105,000 (). The average salary of these designers varies depending on their region. As of 2015 the salary of experienced workers has shifted to approximately US$87,000 () As of January 17, 2020, the average annual pay for a game designer in the United States is $130,000 a year.

== Disciplines ==

=== World design ===
World design is the creation of a backstory, setting and theme for the game; often done by a lead designer. World design can also be the creation of a universe or a map, as well as topics or areas that are likely to be pursued by the player. It is a map referenced for creation of everything as it shows where it is and allows for the most logistical design in any given game. World design shapes the direction the game goes towards.

=== System design ===
System design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns. System design is the enacted simulation of a game designed to interact or react with the player. The &quot;experience&quot; a player has with a game is attributed to how the game&#x27;s system is designed. A complex system with depth leads to a more unpredictable strand of events to immerse the player into the video game.

=== Content design ===
Content design is the creation of characters, items, puzzles, missions, or any aspect of the game that is not required for it to function properly and meet the minimum viable product standard. In essence, content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value.

=== Game writing ===
Game writing involves writing dialogue, text and story.

This is one of the first steps that go into making a video game. This encompasses a number of different elements of the process. Writing in video games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented. Voice acting, text, picture editing and music are all elements of game writing.

=== Level design ===
Level design is the construction of world levels and its features.

Level design makes use of a range of different fields to create a game world. Lighting, space, framing, color and contrast are used to draw a player&#x27;s attention. A designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world or mislead them.

=== User interface design ===
User interface (UI) design deals with the construction the user interactions and feedback interface, like menus or heads-up displays.

The user interface also incorporates game mechanics design. Deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world, or perhaps leave them uninformed. Another aspect to consider is the method of input a game will use and deciding to what degree a player can interact with a game with these inputs. These choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game, as it directly affects the player in both noticeable and subtle ways.

User interface design in video games has unique goals. A conscious decision has to be made regarding the amount of information to relay to the player. However, the UI in games do not have to be absolutely streamlined. Players expect challenges and are willing to accept them as long as the experience is sufficiently rewarding. By the same token, navigating or interaction with a game&#x27;s UI can be satisfying without the need to be effortless.

=== Audio design ===
Audio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game, like music, sound effects or voice acting. This includes the theme song and jingles used in title screens and menus.

=== User experience design ===
The disciplines listed above all combine to form the discipline of game feel. It ensures that the flow of the game and the user interaction with the game elements are functioning smoothly.

== Game elements ==
=== Narrative ===

Numerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game, making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value, although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all. The original version of &quot;Tetris&quot; is an example of a game apparently without narrative. Some narratologists claim that all games have a narrative element. Some go further and claim that games are essentially a form of narrative. Narrative in practice can be the starting point for the development of a game or can be added to a design that started as a set of game mechanics.

=== Gameplay ===

Gameplay is the interactive aspects of video game design. Gameplay involves player interaction with the game, usually for the purpose of gameplay is entertainment, education or training.

== Design process ==

=== Conceptualization ===
The design process varies from designer to designer and companies have different formal procedures and philosophies.

The typical &quot;textbook&quot; approach is to start with a concept or a previously completed game and from there create a game design document. This document is intended to map out the complete game design and acts as a central resource for the development team. This document should ideally be updated as the game evolves throughout the production process.

=== Role Adaptation ===
Designers are frequently expected to adapt to multiple roles of widely varying nature; for example, concept prototyping can be assisted with the use of pre-existing engines and tools like GameMaker Studio, Unity, Godot or Construct. Level designs might be done first on paper and again for the game engine using a 3D modeling tool. Scripting languages are used for multiple elements—AI, cutscenes, GUI, environmental processes, and a number of other behaviors and effects—that designers would want to tune without a programmer&#x27;s assistance. Setting, story and character concepts require a research and writing process. Designers may oversee focus testing, write up art and audio asset lists and write game documentation. In addition to the skillset, designers are ideally clear communicators with attention to detail and ability to delegate responsibilities appropriately.

=== Design Approval ===
Design approval in the commercial setting is a continuous process from the earliest stages until the game ships.

When a new project is being discussed (either internally or as a result of dialogue with potential publishers), the designer may be asked to write a sell-sheet of short concepts, followed by a one or two-page pitch of specific features, audience, platform and other details. Designers will first meet with leads in other departments to establish agreement on the feasibility of the game given the available time, scope and budget. If the pitch is approved, early milestones focus on the creation of a fleshed-out design document. Some developers advocate a prototyping phase before the design document is written to experiment with new ideas before they become part of the design.

=== Production and Decision-Making ===
As production progresses, designers are asked to make frequent decisions about elements missing from the design. The consequences of these decisions are hard to predict and often can only be determined after creating the full implementation. These are referred to as the &quot;unknowns&quot; of the design and the faster they are uncovered, the less risk the team faces later in the production process. Outside factors such as budget cuts or changes in milestone expectations also result in cuts to the design and while overly large cuts can take the heart out of a project, cuts can also result in a streamlined design with only the essential features, polished well.

=== Finalization and Quality Assurance ===
Towards the end of production, designers take the brunt of responsibility for ensuring that the gameplay remains at a uniform standard throughout the game, even in very long games. This task is made more difficult under &quot;crunch&quot; conditions, as the entire team may begin to lose sight of the core gameplay once pressured to hit a date for a finished and bug-free game.

==Game design tools==
Traditionally, game designers used simple tools like Word, Excel or just plain pen and paper. As the field has evolved and player agency and localization started to play a bigger role in game development, the need for professional tools has emerged for this particular field.

Examples of software for narrative design and storytelling include articy:draft 3 and Twine. Tools like these often help to inform the earliest stages of the design and development process, before visual content and software development is started in earnest.

There are various kinds of free 3D design software available to the public, from the mainly graphically focussed, such as Blender, to game engines and software development toolkits, such as Unreal Engine and Unity, that promote communities that self-educate as well as market 3D models and tutorials for beginners.

<text>The Language Movement Day (), officially called Language Martyrs&#x27; Day (), is a national holiday of Bangladesh taking place on 21 February each year and commemorating the Bengali language movement and its martyrs. On this day, people visit Shaheed Minar to pay homage to the movement&#x27;s martyrs and arrange seminars discussing and promoting Bengali as the state language of Bangladesh.

==Background==

After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous eastern part of the Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan&#x27;s 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan&#x27;s government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests immediately arose. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread and a large number of Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka. The language movement prompted the people of East Bengal (later East Pakistan) to establish a separate national identity, distinct from that of the remainder of Pakistan (later West Pakistan.)

==Protest==

At nine o&#x27;clock on the morning of 21 February 1952, students began gathering on the premises of the University of Dhaka in defiance of Section 144 of the penal code. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards the gate to warn the students. A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating Section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators&#x27; way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and Abdul Jabbar. As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began. At the assembly, six legislators including Manoranjan Dhar, Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Datta requested that chief minister Nurul Amin visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning. This motion was supported by some of the treasury bench members including Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed. However Nurul Amin refused the requests.

==Effects==

===Constitutional reform===
On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League&#x27;s support, to grant official status to Bengali. Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the Constitution of Pakistan was amended to provide that &quot;The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali.&quot;

However, the military government formed by Ayub Khan made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution&#x27;s policy of two state languages.

===Independence of Bangladesh===

Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan at the expense of East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called &quot;Bangladesh&quot; (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.

==Commemoration==

To commemorate this movement, Shaheed Minar, a solemn and symbolic sculpture, was erected in the place of the massacre.

Following the formation of the provincial government by the United Front in April 1954, the anniversary of 21 February was declared a holiday. The day is revered in Bangladesh where it is a public holiday and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in West Bengal as the &quot;Martyrs&#x27; Day&quot;.

UNESCO decided to observe 21 February as International Mother Language Day. The UNESCO General Conference took the decision that took effect on 17 November 1999, when it unanimously adopted a draft resolution submitted by Bangladesh and co-sponsored and supported by 28 other countries.

<doc id="473531" wikidata="Q1141081" url="?curid=473531" title="Lounge music">
<text>Lounge music is a type of easy listening music popular in the 1950s and 1960s. It may be meant to evoke in the listeners the feeling of being in a place, usually with a tranquil theme, such as a jungle, an island paradise or outer space. The range of lounge music encompasses beautiful music–influenced instrumentals, modern electronica (with chillout, and downtempo influences), while remaining thematically focused on its retro–space age cultural elements. The earliest type of lounge music appeared during the 1920s and 1930s, and was known as light music.

==Retrospective usage==
Exotica, space age pop, and some forms of easy listening music popular during the 1950s and 1960s are now broadly termed &quot;lounge&quot;. The term &quot;lounge&quot; does not appear in textual documentation of the period, such as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine or long playing album covers, but has been retroactively applied.

While rock and roll was generally influenced by blues and country, lounge music was derived from jazz and other musical elements borrowed from traditions around the world. Exotica from such artists as Les Baxter, Martin Denny, Arthur Lyman, and The Three Suns sold millions of records during its heyday. It combined music that was popular outside the United States, such as various Latin genres (e.g., bossa nova, cha-cha-cha, mambo as in Cal Tjader&#x27;s fine Latin jazz efforts), Polynesian, French, etc. into a relaxed, palatable sound. Such music could have some instruments exaggerated (e.g., a Polynesian song might have an exotic percussion arrangement using bongos, and vocalists imitating wild animals). Many of these recordings were portrayed as originating in exotic foreign lands, but in truth were recorded in Hollywood recording studios by veteran session musicians. Another genre, space age pop, mimicked space age sound effects of the time and reflected the public interest in space exploration. With the advent of stereophonic technology, artists such as Esquivel used spatial audio techniques to full effect, creating whooshing sounds with his orchestra.

A good deal of lounge music was pure instrumental (i.e., no main vocal part, although there could be minor vocal parts). Sometimes, this music would be theme music from movies or TV shows, although such music could be produced independently from other entertainment productions. These instrumentals could be produced with an orchestral arrangement, or from an arrangement of instruments very similar to that found in jazz, or even rock and roll such as the Hammond organ or electric guitar.

==Lounge singers==

&quot;Swinging&quot; music of the era is also considered &quot;lounge&quot; and consisted of a continuation of the swing jazz era of the 1930s and 1940s, but with more of an emphasis on the vocalist. Soft and gentle vocalists such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Dooley Wilson, Pat Boone, Bobby Darin, Jackie Gleason, Wayne Newton, Louis Prima, Sam Butera and Bobby Vinton are notable examples of lounge music. The music of Burt Bacharach was soon featured as part of many lounge singers&#x27; repertoires. Such artists performed mainly at featured lounges in Las Vegas casinos. Documented pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene, the Mary Kaye Trio were first on the scene in the early 1950s.

Lounge singers have a lengthy history stretching back to the decades of the early twentieth century. In any event, these lounge singers, perhaps performing in a hotel or cocktail bar, are usually accompanied by one or two other musicians, and they favor cover songs composed by others, especially pop standards, many deriving from the days of Tin Pan Alley.

Many well-known performers got their start as lounge singers and musicians. Billy Joel worked in a piano bar for six months and penned the song &quot;Piano Man&quot; about his experience.

==Resurgence==
Lounge emerged in the late 1980s as a label of endearment by younger fans whose parents had listened to such music in the 1960s. It has enjoyed resurgences in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, led initially by figures such as Buster Poindexter and Jaymz Bee. In Japan, producer Yasuharu Konishi became popular for his work with Pizzicato Five, and is often considered &quot;the Godfather of ,&quot; a genre mostly derived from 1960s lounge music.

In the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included such groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Coctails, Pink Martini, the High Llamas, Don Tiki, and Nightcaps. The multinational group the Gentle People, signed to the UK label Rephlex Records, attracted an international following and appeared on various lounge and exotica compilations. Alternative band Stereolab demonstrated the influence of lounge with releases like their 1993 EP &quot;Space Age Bachelor Pad Music&quot; and their 1997 album &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;, and in 1996 Capitol Records began issuing the Ultra-Lounge series of lounge music albums. The lounge style was starkly in contrast to the grunge music that dominated the period. These groups wore suits and played music inspired by earlier works of Antônio Carlos Jobim, Juan García Esquivel, Louis Prima and many others.

In 2004, the Parisian band Nouvelle Vague released a self-titled album in which they covered songs from the &#x27;80s post-punk and new wave genres in the style of Bossa Nova. Other artists have taken lounge music to new heights by recombining rock with pop, such as Jon Brion, The Bird and the Bee, Triangle Sun, Pink Martini, the &quot;Buddha-Lounge&quot; series, and the surrounding regulars of Café Largo. The movie &quot;The Rise and Fall of Black Velvet Flag&quot; (2003) is a documentary about three older punk rockers who created a lounge-punk band.

In 2018, British rock band Arctic Monkeys released their sixth studio album, &quot;Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino&quot;. The album, which was a shift in style for the band after 2013&#x27;s &quot;AM&quot;, the album has a more lounge pop sound rather than their previous, alternative rock sound. The album is a concept album about a hotel on the Moon (Tranquility Base is the site of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing) and also reflects on modern society and technology, and its effect on the human mind, with frontman Alex Turner taking inspiration from both old school Science Fiction films, and Neil Postman&#x27;s 1985 book, &quot;Amusing Ourselves To Death&quot;. Their seventh studio album, &quot;The Car&quot; also has a laid-back lounge pop sound, continuing their shift in sound to a lounge pop, and baroque pop style.

==In film==
In the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, five members of the defunct Blues Brothers have formed a lounge act, &quot;Murph and the Magictones,&quot; and are found performing latin-esque music at a Holiday Inn. When the band takes a break to speak with Jake and his brother Elwood, Murph switches on a Muzak version of &quot;Just the Way You Are,&quot; performed by Billy Joel, a former lounge musician himself. Later, when Jake and Elwood are in an elevator, Jobim&#x27;s &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (prime elevator music is heard on Muzak.

The 1989 film &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; starred Jeff Bridges, Beau Bridges, and Michelle Pfeiffer as a successful lounge act.

==Comedy==
Andy Kaufman created a character called Tony Clifton. A parody of show biz entitlement and excess, Clifton is untalented, lazy (often not bothering to remember the words to the songs), and abusive to his audiences.

Bill Murray also portrayed a particularly bad lounge singer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Nick The Lounge Singer, best known for providing his own lyrics to the John Williams theme from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and performing an over-the-top version of the Morris Albert hit &quot;Feelings&quot;. Later on &quot;SNL&quot;, Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer portrayed a goofy married duo of lounge-style musicians, but in unlikely venues such as high school dances. Part of the humor derived from the incongruous application of their &quot;nerdy&quot; and outdated style to performances of current pop-music hits. British comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones appeared as a cheesy keyboard and bass duo during the end credits of one series of their long-running sketch show.

Richard Cheese and the Lounge Kittens perform lounge-style arrangements of recent popular songs for comedic effect.

<doc id="473540" wikidata="Q3393961" url="?curid=473540" title="Corn starch">
<text>Cornflour, cornstarch, maize starch, or corn starch (American English) is the starch derived from corn (maize) grain. The starch is obtained from the endosperm of the kernel. Corn starch is a common food ingredient, often used to thicken sauces or soups, and to make corn syrup and other sugars. Corn starch is versatile, easily modified, and finds many uses in industry such as adhesives, in paper products, as an anti-sticking agent, and textile manufacturing. It has medical uses as well, such as to supply glucose for people with glycogen storage disease.

Like many products in dust form, it can be hazardous in large quantities due to its flammability—see dust explosion. When mixed with a fluid, corn starch can rearrange itself into a non-Newtonian fluid. For example, adding water transforms corn starch into a material commonly known as oobleck while adding oil transforms corn starch into an electrorheological (ER) fluid. The concept can be explained through the mixture termed &quot;cornflour slime&quot;.

== History ==

Until 1851, corn starch was used primarily for starching laundry and for other industrial uses.
A method to produce pure culinary starch from maize was patented by John Polson of Brown &amp; Polson, in Paisley, Scotland in 1854. This was sold as &quot;Patented Corn Flour&quot;. Brown &amp; Polson were muslin manufacturers who had been producing laundry starch for the Paisley shawl industry and would become the largest starch producers in the UK.

== Uses ==
Although mostly used for cooking and as a household item, corn starch is used for many purposes in several industries, ranging from its use as a chemical additive for certain products, to medical therapy for certain illnesses.

=== Culinary ===
Corn starch is used as a thickening agent in liquid-based foods (e.g., soup, sauces, gravies, custard), usually by mixing it with a lower-temperature liquid to form a paste or slurry. It is sometimes preferred over flour alone because it forms a translucent, rather than opaque mixture. As the starch is heated over , the molecular chains unravel, allowing them to collide with other starch chains to form a mesh, thickening the liquid (Starch gelatinization). However, continued boiling breaks up the molecules and thins the liquid.

Cornstarch is usually included as an anticaking agent in powdered sugar (icing or confectioner&#x27;s sugar).

A common substitute is arrowroot starch, which replaces the same amount of corn starch.

Food producers reduce production costs by adding varying amounts of corn starch to foods, for example to cheese and yogurt.

Chicken nuggets with a thin outer layer of corn starch allows increased oil absorption and crispness after the latter stages of frying.

=== Non-culinary ===
Baby powder may include corn starch among its ingredients. Corn starch can be used to manufacture bioplastics (like PLA used for 3D printing) and may be used in the manufacture of airbags.

Adhesive can be made from corn starch, traditionally one of the adhesives that may be used to make paste papers. It dries with a slight sheen compared to wheat starch. It may also be used as an adhesive in book and paper conservation.

=== Medical ===
Corn starch is the preferred anti-stick agent on medical products made from natural latex, including condoms, diaphragms, and medical gloves.

Corn starch has properties enabling supply of glucose to maintain blood sugar levels for people with glycogen storage disease. Corn starch can be used starting at age 6–12 months allowing glucose fluctuations to be deterred.

== Manufacture ==
The corn is steeped for 30 to 48 hours, which ferments it slightly. The germ is separated from the endosperm and those two components are ground separately (still soaked). Next the starch is removed from each by washing. The starch is separated from the corn steep liquor, the cereal germ, the fibers and the corn gluten mostly in hydrocyclones and centrifuges, and then dried. (The residue from every stage is used in animal feed and to make corn oil or other applications.) This process is called wet milling. Finally, the starch may be modified for specific purposes.

== Risks ==
Like many other powders, corn starch is susceptible to dust explosions. It is believed that overheating of a corn starch-based powder—despite warnings on the packaging indicating that the material is flammable—initiated the Formosa Fun Coast explosion in Taiwan on 27 June 2015.

== Names and varieties ==
* Called &quot;corn starch&quot; in the United States and Canada. The term &quot;corn flour&quot; refers to cornmeal that is very finely milled; or, after wet processing with alkali, further grinding then drying, masa flour.
* It is called &quot;cornflour&quot; in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel and some Commonwealth countries. Distinct in these countries from cornmeal.

* Cornflour is commonly derived from wheat in Australia. The starch is extracted from the wheat kernel, and is sometimes referred to as &#x27;wheaten cornflour&#x27;. 

== See also ==
* Amylomaize, high amylose starch
* Bird&#x27;s Custard, the English custard based on cornflour, invented in 1837
* Waxy corn, waxy maize starch
* Corn sauce
* Corn syrup
* Corn ethanol
* Modified starch
* Potato starch
* Semolina

<text>Luther Harris Evans (13 October 1902 – 23 December 1981) was an American political scientist who served as the tenth Librarian of Congress and third Director-General of UNESCO.

==Early life and career==
Born in Sayersville in Bastrop County, Texas in 1902, Evans received his BA in 1923 and MA in 1924 from the University of Texas at Austin and his PhD from Stanford University in 1927, all in political science.

He taught political science at New York University, Dartmouth College, and Princeton University from 1927 until 1935. Evans left Princeton University abruptly after a faculty dispute.

==Government service==
Friends referred him for help to the powerful Lehman family of New York, who got him an appointment with Harry Hopkins, the advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At a meeting in the White House, Hopkins asked the young professor to propose a plan for a project Hopkins already wanted to do. Evans went back the next day and told Hopkins that the project wasn&#x27;t worth doing. Instead, he pointed out that the States Archives of the United States were in a state of disarray with profound consequences to American history. Hopkins said, &quot;Dr. Evans, you have a lot of guts—I know you have no money and that your wife is nine months pregnant, and I have never thought about the state archives. But I hear that you have a good reputation.&quot; This is how Evans came to organize and direct the Historical Records Survey for the Works Project Administration from 1935 to 1939. Evans was later commended for successfully navigating the “frequently heated political environment of Harry Hopkins’ WPA” despite his relative youth and inexperience.

==Librarian of Congress==

After this, he was appointed by Librarian of Congress, Archibald MacLeish, as head of the Legislative Reference Service and later Chief Assistant Librarian of Congress. After MacLeish resigned, president Harry S. Truman appointed Evans as Librarian of Congress, a position he held from 1945 to 1953. During his tenure, Evans opposed censorship of the library&#x27;s holdings, and greatly expanded the library&#x27;s collection.

Well versed in international relations, Evans also returned a number of manuscripts to their countries of origin. He helped draft the Universal Copyright Convention at Geneva in 1952.

During McCarthyism, Evans voluntarily instituted the Federal Loyalty Program at the Library of Congress, placing Verner Clapp in charge of a loyalty board to examine current and potential employees regarding communism and homosexuality. This program resulted in numerous employees being fired or resigning for their political or sexual orientation, and William Carlos Williams was prevented from being appointed to the post of United States Poet Laureate. Evans told Karl Shapiro &quot;we don&#x27;t want any Communists or cocksuckers in this library.&quot;

The Library of Congress exhibit, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Fortress,&quot; covers the tenure of MacLeish and Evans: 1939-1953 during World War II and the founding of UNESCO. 

==UNESCO==
In 1953 Evans resigned from the Library of Congress to accept a position as UNESCO&#x27;s third Director-General, the only American to hold this post.
Evans fired seven UNESCO employees who were US citizens because they refused to submit to a US government loyalty investigation. 

Evans was active in international peace issues throughout his life, serving in many capacities with educational organizations and commissions. He served as President of the United World Federalists in 1970-1976, and his thinking of this period is seen in his testimony before the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 4, 1975 concerning &quot;The United Nations in the 1970s: Recommendations for U.S. Policy&quot;. Working with a range of other Americans prominent in foreign policy, including Father Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame, Norman Cousins of &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, James Grant of the Overseas Development Council, anthropologist Margaret Mead, World Federalist Chairman H. Donald Wilson, and World Bank president Robert McNamara. Evans organized an organization called New Directions. New Directions was to be a U.S. citizen&#x27;s lobby on international issues modeled on Common Cause. It worked for a time, and helped pass the Panama Canal Treaty, but was ultimately unable to find enough funds to sustain it for the long term.

==Later life==
From 1962, he was director of international and legal collections at the Columbia University Libraries until his retirement in 1971.

In 1972 Evans was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership.

He died in 1981 in San Antonio, Texas, aged 79. He was unusual for his generation of Texans because he spoke several languages fluently. He was a renowned story teller who, like his contemporary Lyndon Baines Johnson, used humor to defuse tense political situations in long meetings and build consensus.

His nephew, Jim Evans, was an American League baseball umpire from 1972 through 1999.

<text>The siege of Aligarh also known as the Battle of Aligarh was fought between the Maratha Confederacy and the British East India Company during the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–1805) at Aligarh, India.

Aligarh Fort, one of the strongest forts in India, was fortified and commanded by a French mercenary officer Pierre Perron. It was laid under siege on 1 September 1803, by the British 76th Regiment, now known as the Yorkshire Regiment, under General Lord Gerard Lake. It was captured from the Marathas and French on 4 September 1803. During the assault, fourteen ditches were lined with sword-blades and poisoned chevaux-de-frise around the fort by the French soldiers. The then Duke of Wellington declared the capture as &quot;One of the most extraordinary feats of the British conquest of Northern India&quot;.

<doc id="473547" wikidata="Q1247499" url="?curid=473547" title="McMillan &amp; Wife">
<text>McMillan &amp; Wife (known simply as McMillan from 1976 to 1977) is an American police procedural television series that aired on NBC from September 17, 1971, to April 24, 1977. Starring Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James in the title roles, the series premiered in episodes as part of Universal Television&#x27;s wheel series &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;, in rotation with &quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;McCloud&quot;. Initially airing on Wednesday night, the original lineup was shifted to Sundays in the second season, where it aired for the rest of its run. For the final season, known as &quot;McMillan&quot;, numerous changes were made that included killing off St. James&#x27; character of Sally McMillan.

==Plot==
&quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; revolved around Stuart &quot;Mac&quot; McMillan (Rock Hudson), a former criminal defense attorney who becomes San Francisco police commissioner, and his wife Sally (Susan Saint James). The episodes often found Mac and Sally attending fashionable parties and charity benefits before solving robberies and murders. John Schuck, as McMillan&#x27;s aide Sgt. Charles Enright and Nancy Walker as Mildred, the couple&#x27;s sarcastic, hard-drinking maid, provided comic relief.

Sally is pregnant at the end of season 1, but this is apparently retconned away and is never mentioned in later seasons. She is pregnant again in season 4, and has the baby (a boy) in the final episode of season 4. The baby is not seen or mentioned in season 5.

==Cast==

==Episodes==
The show ran for five seasons as &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and a sixth season as &quot;McMillan&quot; on the NBC television network, from September 17, 1971, to April 24, 1977, for a total of 40 episodes.

==Popularity==
Like the other two original shows in the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; was an immediate hit. After its network run on NBC, it appeared regularly as part of &quot;The CBS Late Movie&quot; and later, in the form of syndicated reruns on local and cable television in the United States.

On January 1, 2015, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; began airing on MeTV as part of the &quot;MeTV Mystery Movie&quot; late night block. That block included the other two long running &quot;Sunday Mystery Movie&quot; series, &quot;McCloud&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;, the &quot;Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot; series &quot;Banacek&quot; and the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television movies. Each week featured a different series, with the series airing every night during its feature week.

Beginning in 2022, the series airs on Cozi TV as part of a &quot;Columbo &amp; Company&quot; programming block, paired with episodes of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; programs &quot;Columbo&quot;; &quot;McCloud&quot;; &quot;Banacek&quot; and &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;

==Cast and series name change==
For its sixth and final season, the series underwent a major retooling. Susan Saint James left after being unable to come to terms on a new contract. Nancy Walker also left the series before the sixth season premiered in 1976 to star in &quot;The Nancy Walker Show&quot;, a sitcom that was cancelled after 12 episodes.

With these developments, the show became known as &quot;McMillan&quot; and Sally was killed off in a plane crash along with the couple&#x27;s never-seen son. Mac, now a widower, moved out of the family home and into a luxury apartment. Mildred, meanwhile, was written out as having left the McMillans to open her own diner on the East Coast, which was an inside joke playing up her role as Rosie the waitress in a then-ongoing series of commercials for Bounty paper towels.

John Schuck had his role reduced as he joined the sitcom &quot;Holmes &amp; Yoyo&quot; which was produced by Leonard B. Stern. Meanwhile, Sergeant Enright was promoted to Lieutenant and became Deputy Chief of the San Francisco Police, which took him away from his position as Mac&#x27;s liaison. Martha Raye, who had played Mildred&#x27;s sister Agatha in an earlier episode, joined the series full-time with Agatha taking over Mildred&#x27;s role as Mac&#x27;s housekeeper in his new apartment. Richard Gilliland joined the cast as Enright&#x27;s replacement, Sergeant DiMaggio, who always introduced himself by saying &quot;no relation&quot; (in reference to Joe DiMaggio).

==Home media==
Universal Studios released the first season of &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; on DVD in Region 1 &amp; Region 2 in 2005/2006.

On May 21, 2010, Visual Entertainment announced it had acquired the rights to distribute &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; on DVD in Region 1. They subsequently released seasons 2–6 on DVD in Canada and the USA. All US releases are distributed by Millennium Entertainment.

On November 30, 2012, VEI released &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in both the US and Canada. This 24-disc set features all 40 episodes of the series as well as bonus copy of &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot; Complete Collection.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released all six seasons on DVD in Australia. On November 20, 2013, it released &quot;McMillan and Wife: The Complete Collection&quot;, a 19-disc set featuring all 40 episodes of the series.

==Filming locations==
The interior set of the McMillans&#x27; home in the pilot episode was actually Rock Hudson&#x27;s house. In the second episode they moved to a new home, exterior shots were done on Greenwich Street in San Francisco. The address for the couple was once given in the show as 250 Trenton Street. In later episodes a different house was used as the exterior shot of the house. In the final season McMillan, newly widowed, moved into an apartment and the house was never seen or mentioned again.

<doc id="473551" wikidata="Q798426" url="?curid=473551" title="Mandrillus">
<text>Mandrillus is a genus of large Old World monkeys distributed throughout central and southern Africa, consisting of two species: &quot;M. sphinx&quot; and &quot;M. leucophaeus&quot;, the mandrill and drill, respectively. &quot;Mandrillus&quot;, originally placed under the genus &quot;Papio&quot; as a type of baboon, is closely related to the genus &quot;Cercocebus&quot;. They are characterised by their large builds, elongated snouts with furrows on each side, and stub tails. Both species occupy the west central region of Africa and live primarily on the ground. They are frugivores, consuming both meat and plants, with a preference for plants. &quot;M. sphinx&quot; is classified as vulnerable and &quot;M. leucophaeus&quot; as endangered on the &quot;IUCN Red List of Threatened Species&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Mandrillus&quot; is a genus within the tribe Papionini, which in turn is under the subfamily Cercopithecinae. This subfamily is classified under the family of Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae) within the infraorder Simiiformes. The Papionini tribe contains six other genera: baboons (&quot;Papio&quot;), macaques (&quot;Macaca&quot;), crested mangabeys (&quot;Lophocebus&quot;), white-eyelid mangabeys (&quot;Cercocebus&quot;), the highland mangabey (&quot;Rungwecebus&quot;) and &quot;Theropithecus&quot;.

Originally, both species were considered part of the &quot;Papio&quot; genus, as forest baboons, due to superficial similarities such as size and appearance, particularly in facial features. However, studies conducted analysing anatomical and genetic differences between the current &quot;Mandrillus&quot; and &quot;Papio&quot; genera showed more differences than similarities resulting in the current taxonomic ranking. Furthermore, the studies showed &quot;Mandrillus&quot; are more closely related to the white eyed mangabeys, and diverged relatively recently (4 million years ago) from this genus.

=== Species ===


== Anatomy ==

Both species of &quot;Mandrillus&quot; develop extremely large muzzles, prominent nasal ridges and paranasal swelling (swelling in the area adjacent to the nostrils). The size and colour of the paranasal swellings correlate to male dominance and rank, while the size of nasal ridges is a way of attracting mates. &quot;Mandrillus&quot; teeth consist of two incisors, two premolars, one canine and three molars in each half of the upper and lower jaw, totalling 32 teeth. Furthermore &quot;Mandrillus&quot; display larger premolars and extended canines; these dental traits are better adapted to crushing hard objects. This is due to a large part of their diet consisting of hard, dry nuts and seeds that require greater crushing power and the use of their teeth in ripping apart rotting wood to search for insects and other invertebrates.

Within the shoulder and upper arm structures of the &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys a deep scapular, broad deltoid plane, narrow stable elbow region and other skeletal features indicate the use of the forelimbs for climbing and foraging. This is used by the monkeys to climb trees when searching for ripe fruit and in the aggressive foraging of the forest floor in search of food. &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys have developed an extremely broad and robust ilium, and a rounded tibial shaft. The development of these features can be attributed to the climbing of trees and quadrupedal locomotion. The largest toe is separated from the remaining toes for increased grasping power when climbing trees.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Both species of &quot;Mandrillus&quot; demonstrate a great degree of sexual dimorphism in weight, anatomy and physical appearance. The mandrill displays the most extreme sexual dimorphism for weight among all primates, with a male-female weight ratio of 3.2 – 3.4 at eight to ten years of age. Similarly, drills are one of the most sexually dimorphic primates for body weight, with a male growing up to 32 kg while a female grows to 12 kg. Sexual dimorphism is also displayed in the growth of the craniofacial bones of both species. The males of each species have longer muzzles, much larger paranasal swellings and longer canines than their female counterparts. In a study of wild drills, female muzzles only grew up to 70% the length of the male muzzles. Furthermore, males have brightly coloured, saturated rumps unlike their female counterparts. Both species also display the greatest visual sexual dimorphism within monkeys. On a scale based on rating the differences in physical features between genders, the mandrill obtained 32 whilst the drill obtained 24.5. These ratings are based on features such as the saturation and colour of the rump (and face for mandrills), the paranasal swelling, the fatted rump and fur colouring.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys have a very localised biographical region located in West central Africa. The two species are often considered allopatric, they occupy non-overlapping regions, and their regions are divided by a physical barrier, the Sanaga river in Cameroon. &quot;Mandrillus leucophaeus&quot; occupy the area above the river in North western Cameroon and southwestern Nigeria up until the Cross River, and Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea) which lies off the coast. The mandrill occupies the area below the river line in Cameroon, Río Muni, Gabon and Congo. The &quot;Mandrillus&quot; species occupy multiple sections of the Guinean forests of West Africa, including Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests and Cameroonian Highlands forests. The forests the monkeys occupy have a humid, tropical climate and rugged terrain. Deforestation has reduced the habitat of both &quot;Mandrillus&quot; species, reducing the distribution of each species, especially the drill.

== Behaviour ==

=== Diet ===
Both &quot;Mandrillus&quot; species are frugivores, consuming both plants and insects with a preference for fruits and nuts. &quot;Mandrillus&quot; species spend a large amount of their time foraging through the forest in search of food. In a study conducted in Cameroon, approximately 84% of the faecal matter of mandrills consisted of fruit. Similarly, a study done on drills in southwest Cameroon showed that the mean weight of fruit and seed in faecal matter was equal to or greater than 80%. Seasonal changes can be seen within &quot;Mandrillus&quot; diet, during peak fruit season (September to March) their diet consisted mostly of fruit, pulp and seeds whilst during the fruit scarce season (June to August) there was a great increase in the consumption of insects, woody tissue and especially nuts. There was also an increase in the variation of the diet during the fruit-scarce season. Important fruit include but are not limited to, the fruit of the bush mango (&quot;Irvingia gabonensis&quot;), African Corkwood tree (&quot;Musanga cecropioides&quot;), &quot;Grewia coriacea&quot;, &quot;Sacoglottis gabonensis&quot; and &quot;Xylopia aethiopica&quot;. Invertebrates consumed include crickets, ants, caterpillars and termites. Rarely, &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys will eat larger animals, such as rats and gazelles when presented with the opportunity.

=== Social systems ===
The species of the genus exhibit great similarities in their social systems. Both generally form smaller groups, however the size of these groups is unclear. A study done on drills in southwest Cameroon found a mean group size of 52.3 while another more recent report stated a figure of 25–40 on these smaller groups. A study of mandrills done at Campo reserve in Cameroon found small groups contain 14 - 95 individuals. These smaller groups, with stable social structures, often join to form larger &quot;supergroups&quot; of hundreds of individuals. Some of the largest mandrill &quot;supergroups&quot; reported contained up to 845 individuals whilst some of the largest drill &quot;supergroups&quot; reported contained 400 individuals. There have been reports of solitary male &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys, however this occurs very rarely.

The social structures and social hierarchy of &quot;Mandrillus&quot; &quot;supergroups&quot; and groups is highly contentious. There are multiple older (1970s-1990s) sources referencing single male units, which contained a male and multiple female monkeys, as the smallest and most common stable social structure. However this has been disproved with the discovery of less colourful male &quot;Mandrillus&quot; and further observations of behaviour. &quot;Mandrillus leucophaeus&quot; social structures are unknown, due to low populations, and secluded habitats with dense forestry. On the other hand, &quot;Mandrillus sphinx&quot; has had a variety of studies on social structure done in largely captive and semi-free ranging settings, with few studies on wild mandrills. The current studies on mandrills are inconclusive, and present different results. Various semi-free ranging studies conducted report a matrilineal social structure with a stable infant and female mandrill &quot;supergroup&quot;. Male &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys would disperse from this group when old enough and join other groups only during mating season. Further studies, also done in semi-free ranging settings, conclude that dominant females are central to group cohesion and connectivity (how close they remained). Conversely, a study on wild mandrills published in 2015 reported that a stable adult, male mandrill population of 5 - 6 was present year round in &quot;supergroups&quot;. This aligned with the social structures reported in other research papers done on wild mandrills, where stable multi-male and multi-female groups were found. This difference in social structures between &quot;Mandrillus&quot; groups has been attributed to limitations in observing wild mandrills, differing habitats, and differing sample sizes.

Male dominance and rank have been linked to the colouration and colour extension of the rumps, greater saturation and colour extension correlated to higher-ranking males. Males of higher ranking are more likely to associate with females, especially those with sexual skin swelling, and more likely to successfully mount females. Dominant, adult males practice mate guarding on adult females during times of maximal skin swelling; with their high competitive ability they are more likely to successfully reproduce. Due to the tropical habitat, mating season coincides with the dry season (May to October) and birth season coincides with the wet season (November to April).

=== Communication ===

The &quot;Mandrillus&quot; genus uses both visual and vocal forms of communication, which are extremely similar or identical across both species. Both species have three identical long-range vocal communications: two-phase grunts, roars and &quot;crowling&quot;. The two-phased grunt is a low, two-syllable continuous sound used exclusively by adult males during calm group progression and mate guarding. Roars are single low, single syllable sounds used exclusively by males in the same context as two-phase grunts. Crowling is used by infants and females during group movement or foraging to call together the dispersed group.

They also use numerous short-range vocal sounds for various purposes. The &quot;yak&quot; and grinding of teeth are used during tense situations. The grunt is used in aggressive situations and screams are used to escape or while experiencing fear. The growl is used to convey mild alarm, the K-alarm is used to convey intense alarm and the &quot;girney&quot; is used for appeasement. Both species use various facial expressions to communicate with each other. The silent baring of teeth is a positive visual signal conveying peaceful intentions, and it is often combined with a shaking head. Staring open-mouthed is a display of aggression, frowning with bare teeth is used to encourage submission, staring with bare teeth can communicate aggression or fear, pouting signals submission and a relaxed open mouth encourages playing.

== Conservation status ==
The current conservation status of &quot;Mandrillus sphinx&quot; is vulnerable and that for &quot;Mandrillus leucophaeus&quot; is endangered. The greatest threats to the conservation of this genus are the severe loss and degradation of their habitat, and hunting. The loss of habitat is an ongoing threat that can be attributed to the expansion of human settlements as well as the clearing of forests for chipping factories and agriculture. Hunting and poaching of &quot;Mandrillus&quot; monkeys for meat or to protect crops is also major, ongoing threat to the population despite the implementation of hunting restrictions and sanctuaries. The drill population in Cameroon, which encompasses 80% of the drill&#x27;s original habitat, has been fragmented into smaller, isolated populations with largest residing in Korup national park. The mandrill population in south Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea are at great risk due to extensive forest loss. The majority of the mandrill population remains in Gabon and faces major threats from railroad construction and logging companies. As of 2020, the mandrill population is in decline while the drill population is not able to be accurately determined.

<doc id="473577" wikidata="Q4887449" url="?curid=473577" title="Benefit performance">
<text>A benefit performance is a type of live entertainment which is undertaken for a cause. In its original usage, benefit performances were opportunities for an actor to supplement his/her income. In its modern usage, benefit performances are given to raise money for or awareness of a humanitarian cause, or for the immediate benefit of an audience.

== As a benefit for performers ==

The concept of a benefit performance originates in England where they were used from at least 1685 to about 1870. During this time, a theater performer would be hired with a contract typically stipulating at least one benefit performance a year. For this event, the actor&#x27;s employer, the theater company, would offer the &quot;bénéficiaire&quot; (as the recipient was termed) 100% (in the case of a &quot;clear&quot; benefit) of the event&#x27;s proceeds as a bonus pay. Other forms of the benefit were the &quot;half-clear&quot; benefit in which the artist was entitled to 50% of the proceeds. There were also instances of multiple actors appearing in and benefiting from a single performance.

While the benefit performance was intended to supplement the actor&#x27;s income, they were also used by theater companies as an excuse to pay actors a lower salary. The benefit system soon became a strong indicator of an actor&#x27;s popularity. In some cases, if the ticket sales were low enough, the actor would lose money from the performance.

In the 1860s, the practice of benefit performances began to wane as the theater industry began to change its employment practices. Instead of offering short term contracts, theater companies began to pay actors based on the length of their play&#x27;s run, which was determined by ticket sales. This allowed managers to pay actors higher salaries so long as plays were profitable.

The Beatles song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; alludes to a poster for one such event.

==As a benefit for humanitarian causes==
In its modern usage, a benefit performance almost exclusively refers to a fund-raising event. In this case, the performers and producers receive little to no compensation as the proceeds are given to support a humanitarian cause, e.g. charitable foundations, medical research, or humanitarian relief in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Performers may still benefit indirectly from the performance if the cause is for their welfare, e.g. the Actors Benevolent Fund.

Modern benefit concerts are this type of performance, and are often used, in addition to raising funds, as a means of raising awareness of the cause. This is often done by televising the event.

==As a benefit for audiences==

The concept of a benefit performance also exists as an act of charity by the performers for the sake of the immediate audience. An early example of this is the Disney film &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot; (1934) in which Mickey Mouse and his friends put on a free show for a local orphanage. Later in the 20th century, the United Service Organizations (USO) became well known for providing live entertainment to troops overseas to raise morale.

<text>Créteil () is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, Île-de-France. It is located from the centre of Paris. Créteil is the &quot;préfecture&quot; (capital) of the Val-de-Marne department as well as the seat of the Arrondissement of Créteil. The city is, moreover, the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese and of one of France&#x27;s 30 nationwide &quot;académies&quot; (districts) of the Ministry of National Education.

== Name ==
The name Créteil was recorded for the first time as Cristoilum in the martyrology written by a monk named Usuard in 865. The name &quot;Cristoilum&quot; is made of the Celtic word &quot;ialo&quot; (meaning &quot;clearing, glade&quot;, &quot;place of&quot;) suffixed to a pre-Latin radical &quot;crist-&quot; whose meaning is still unclear. Some believe &quot;crist&quot; is a Celtic word meaning &quot;ridge&quot;, a cognate of Latin &quot;crista&quot; and modern French &quot;crête&quot;, in which case the meaning of &quot;Cristoilum&quot; would be &quot;clearing on the ridge&quot; or &quot;place on the ridge.&quot; A more traditional etymology was that &quot;crist&quot; referred to Jesus Christ, due to the very ancient presence of Christianity in Créteil and the veneration of Saint Agoard and Agilbert of Créteil, martyred in Créteil around AD 400.

== Geography ==
Créteil is a city in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris. It is watered by the Marne river which carries out its last loop before the junction with the Seine at the Charenton-le-Pont. The area is an alluvial plain eroded by the action of the Marne and the Seine. Bordering communes include Maisons-Alfort, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Bonneuil-sur-Marne, Limeil-Brévannes, Valenton, Choisy-le-Roi and Alfortville.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Créteil has a marine west coast climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfb&quot; on climate maps.

== History ==

Some rare flints from the Palaeolithic age are still being found in modern times in the area. It is, however, a two-ton, Neolithic-era polishing machine that is the prehistoric pride of Créteil. The first documents referring to Créteil are from the Merovingian era, when it was known as &quot;Vicus Cristoilum&quot;&#x27; The name comes from the prefix &quot;crist&quot; and &quot;oilum&quot;. These two terms are thought to be Gallic: &quot;clearing&quot; for &quot;oilum&quot; and &quot;ridge&quot; for &quot;crist&quot;. The &quot;clearing&quot; of the &quot;ridge&quot; of the Mont-Mesly is on the road connecting Paris and Sens (Trunk Road 19 today). In 1406, the place name &quot;Créteil&quot; makes its appearance after successive deformations from &quot;Cristoill&quot; (1278), &quot;Cristeuil&quot;, &quot;Cresteul&quot; then &quot;Creteuil&quot;.

During the French Wars of Religion (1567), the Huguenots plundered the church and burned the local charters. New disorders in 1648 forced the evacuation of the inhabitants of Créteil. The end of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign was marked by a great food shortage throughout the whole of France after a terrible winter in 1709 that resulted in 69 recorded deaths in Créteil. Registers of grievances from the French Revolution in 1789 mention Créteil 15 times.

At the beginning of the 18th century, construction of the first middle-class &quot;Parisian&quot; houses began. In 1814, the east of Créteil was taken by Russian troops as part of the Battle of Paris. The bridge which spans the Marne between Créteil and Saint-Maur-des-Fossés was inaugurated on 9 April 1841, replacing an ancient ferry.

The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 was particularly cruel for Créteil. The borough was plundered and left in ruins by the Prussians, while the nearby battle of Mont-Mesly on 30 November 1870, left 179 dead.

L&#x27;Abbaye de Créteil or Abbaye group was a utopian artistic and literary community founded during 1906 named after the Créteil Abbey near to where some members lived and where the group held meetings. At the time Créteil was still mostly pastoral, some of which remains in the forested parkland of the riverside district on and around Ile Sainte-Catherine. 
Although the group was short-lived, disbanding by 1908, it attracted artists, writers and philosophers to become associated with the Symbolist and Futurist movements such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, author of the Futurist Manifesto, and Constantin Brâncuși.

Créteil gave up its pastoral character after World War II. The population subsequently rose from 13,800 in 1954 to 30,654 in 1962. In 1965, the city became a Préfecture of the new department of the Val-de-Marne. A new Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1974.

== The lake ==
Créteil Lake began as a gypsum and gravel quarry. Once the groundwater was reached, forming deep ponds, the quarry was abandoned and allowed to fill with water. The lake area is now a popular recreational site attracting fishermen, boaters, wind surfers, etc...

<text>In classical mechanics, the parameters that define the configuration of a system are called &quot;generalized coordinates,&quot; and the space defined by these coordinates is called the configuration space of the physical system. It is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints, such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates. This manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system. Notice that this is a notion of &quot;unrestricted&quot; configuration space, i.e. in which different point particles may occupy the same position. In mathematics, in particular in topology, a notion of &quot;restricted&quot; configuration space is mostly used, in which the diagonals, representing &quot;colliding&quot; particles, are removed.

==Examples==

===A particle in 3D space===
The position of a single particle moving in ordinary Euclidean 3-space is defined by the vector formula_1, and therefore its &quot;configuration space&quot; is formula_2. It is conventional to use the symbol formula_3 for a point in configuration space; this is the convention in both the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, and in Lagrangian mechanics. The symbol formula_4 is used to denote momenta; the symbol formula_5 refers to velocities.

A particle might be constrained to move on a specific manifold. For example, if the particle is attached to a rigid linkage, free to swing about the origin, it is effectively constrained to lie on a sphere. Its configuration space is the subset of coordinates in formula_6 that define points on the sphere formula_7. In this case, one says that the manifold formula_8 is the sphere, &quot;i.e.&quot; formula_9.

For &quot;n&quot; disconnected, non-interacting point particles, the configuration space is formula_10. In general, however, one is interested in the case where the particles interact: for example, they are specific locations in some assembly of gears, pulleys, rolling balls, &quot;etc.&quot; often constrained to move without slipping. In this case, the configuration space is not all of formula_10, but the subspace (submanifold) of allowable positions that the points can take.

===Rigid body in 3D space===
The set of coordinates that define the position of a reference point and the orientation of a coordinate frame attached to a rigid body in three-dimensional space form its configuration space, often denoted formula_12 where formula_13 represents the coordinates of the origin of the frame attached to the body, and formula_14 represents the rotation matrices that define the orientation of this frame relative to a ground frame. A configuration of the rigid body is defined by six parameters, three from formula_13 and three from formula_14, and is said to have six degrees of freedom.

In this case, the configuration space formula_17 is six-dimensional, and a point formula_18 is just a point in that space. The &quot;location&quot; of formula_3 in that configuration space is described using generalized coordinates; thus, three of the coordinates might describe the location of the center of mass of the rigid body, while three more might be the Euler angles describing its orientation. There is no canonical choice of coordinates; one could also choose some tip or endpoint of the rigid body, instead of its center of mass; one might choose to use quaternions instead of Euler angles, and so on. However, the parameterization does not change the mechanical characteristics of the system; all of the different parameterizations ultimately describe the same (six-dimensional) manifold, the same set of possible positions and orientations. 

Some parameterizations are easier to work with than others, and many important statements can be made by working in a coordinate-free fashion. Examples of coordinate-free statements are that the tangent space formula_20 corresponds to the velocities of the points formula_18, while the cotangent space formula_22 corresponds to momenta. (Velocities and momenta can be connected; for the most general, abstract case, this is done with the rather abstract notion of the tautological one-form.)

===Robotic arm===
For a robotic arm consisting of numerous rigid linkages, the configuration space consists of the location of each linkage (taken to be a rigid body, as in the section above), subject to the constraints of how the linkages are attached to each other, and their allowed range of motion. Thus, for formula_23 linkages, one might consider the total space
formula_24
except that all of the various attachments and constraints mean that not every point in this space is reachable. Thus, the configuration space formula_8 is necessarily a subspace of the formula_23-rigid-body configuration space. 

Note, however, that in robotics, the term &quot;configuration space&quot; can also refer to a further-reduced subset: the set of reachable positions by a robot&#x27;s end-effector. This definition, however, leads to complexities described by the holonomy: that is, there may be several different ways of arranging a robot arm to obtain a particular end-effector location, and it is even possible to have the robot arm move while keeping the end effector stationary. Thus, a complete description of the arm, suitable for use in kinematics, requires the specification of &quot;all&quot; of the joint positions and angles, and not just some of them.

The joint parameters of the robot are used as generalized coordinates to define configurations. The set of joint parameter values is called the &quot;joint space&quot;. A robot&#x27;s forward and inverse kinematics equations define maps between configurations and end-effector positions, or between joint space and configuration space. Robot motion planning uses this mapping to find a path in joint space that provides an achievable route in the configuration space of the end-effector.

== Formal definition ==
In classical mechanics, the &quot;configuration&quot; of a system refers to the position of all constituent point particles of the system.

==Phase space==
The configuration space is insufficient to completely describe a mechanical system: it fails to take into account velocities. The set of velocities available to a system defines a plane tangent to the configuration manifold of the system. At a point formula_18, that tangent plane is denoted by formula_28. Momentum vectors are linear functionals of the tangent plane, known as cotangent vectors; for a point formula_18, that cotangent plane is denoted by formula_30. The set of positions and momenta of a mechanical system forms the cotangent bundle formula_22 of the configuration manifold formula_8. This larger manifold is called the phase space of the system.

== Quantum state space ==

In quantum mechanics, configuration space can be used (see for example the Mott problem), but the classical mechanics extension to phase space cannot. Instead, a rather different set of formalisms and notation are used in the analogous concept called quantum state space. The analog of a &quot;point particle&quot; becomes a single point in formula_33, the complex projective line, also known as the Bloch sphere. It is complex, because a quantum-mechanical wave function has a complex phase; it is projective because the wave-function is normalized to unit probability. That is, given a wave-function formula_34 one is free to normalize it by the total probability formula_35, thus making it projective.

<doc id="473612" wikidata="Q7655677" url="?curid=473612" title="Sweetest Day">
<text>Sweetest Day is a holiday that is celebrated in the Midwestern United States, in parts of the Northeastern United States, in Arizona, and in Florida on the third Saturday in October. It is a day to share romantic deeds or expressions, and acts of charity and kindness. Sweetest Day has also been referred to as a &quot;Hallmark holiday&quot; or a &quot;concocted promotion&quot; created by the candy industry solely to increase sales of sweets.

==Origin==

The first Sweetest Day was observed on October 10, 1921, in Cleveland. The Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&#x27;s&quot; edition of October 8, 1922, which chronicles the first Sweetest Day in Cleveland, states that the first Sweetest Day was planned by a committee of 12 confectioners chaired by candymaker C. C. Hartzell. &quot;The Sweetest Day in the Year Committee&quot; distributed over 20,000 boxes of candy to &quot;newsboys, orphans, old folks, and the poor&quot; in Cleveland. The &quot;Sweetest Day in the Year Committee&quot; was assisted in the distribution of candy by some of the biggest movie stars of the day including Theda Bara and Ann Pennington.

There were also several attempts to start a &quot;Sweetest Day&quot; in New York City, including a declaration of a Candy Day throughout the United States by candy manufacturers on October 8, 1922. In 1927, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the powers that determine the nomenclature of the weeks of October&quot; decreed that the week beginning on October 10, 1927, would be known as &quot;Sweetest Week.&quot; On September 25, 1937, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported under &quot;Advertising News and Notes&quot; that The National Confectioners Association had launched a &quot;movement throughout the candy industry&quot; to rank Sweetest Day with the nationally accepted Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, and St. Valentine&#x27;s Day.

In 1940, another Sweetest Day was proclaimed on October 19. The promotional event was marked by the distribution of more than 10,000 boxes of candy by the &quot;Sweetest Day Committee.&quot; The candy was distributed among 26 local charities. 225 children were given candy in the chapel at the &quot;Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children &quot; on October 17, 1940. 600 boxes of candy were also delivered to the presidents of the Jewish, Protestant and Catholic Big Sister groups of New York.
==Regional importance==
Retail Confectioners International describes the observance as &quot;much more important for candymakers in some regions than in others (Detroit and Cleveland being the biggest Sweetest Day cities)&quot;. The popularity in Detroit was greatly perpetuated by the Sanders Candy Company. Frederick Sanders was a large promoter of the holiday. In 2006, Hallmark marketed 151 greeting card designs for Sweetest Day. American Greetings marketed 178.

Sweetest Day observance is still most prevalent in the Great Lakes region, where the holiday originated, including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. According to Hallmark, &quot;the once-regional celebration of Sweetest Day has spread throughout the country.&quot; In addition to those states where it is &quot;most prevalent&quot;, Sweetest Day is celebrated by communities in Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia, bringing the total to 17 states.

==Criticism==
Since Sweetest Day was invented by commercial interests which stood to profit from such a holiday, critics refer to it as a &quot;Hallmark holiday&quot; (although it was not invented by the Hallmark Cards company).

<text>Saint-Maur-des-Fossés () is a commune in Val-de-Marne, the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France, from the centre of Paris.

==History==
===Abbey===
Saint-Maur-des-Fossés owes its name to Saint-Maur Abbey, founded in 638 by Queen Nanthild, regent for her son Clovis II, at a place called &quot;Fossati&quot; in Medieval Latin and &quot;Les Fossés&quot; in modern French, meaning &quot;the moats&quot;. This place, located at the narrow entrance of a loop where the river Marne made its way round a rocky outcrop, was probably named after the moats of an ancient Celtic oppidum and later a Roman castrum; the site was known in medieval documents as &quot;Castrum Bagaudarum&quot;, at a time when the marauding Bagaudae had developed a legendary reputation as defenders of Christians against Roman persecution. Massive foundations, sited so far from a &quot;Roman frontier&quot;, were attributed by C. Jullian to a temple or a villa instead. In Merovingian times, Gallo-Roman villas in the royal fisc were repeatedly donated as sites for monasteries under royal patronage.

The abbey, dedicated to Saint Peter, Saint Paul and the Virgin Mary, was called &quot;Sanctus Petrus Fossatensis&quot; in Medieval Latin (&quot;Saint Pierre des Fossés&quot; in French), meaning &quot;Saint Peter of the Moats&quot;. It was founded by Blidegisil, archdeacon of Paris, in 638. One of the early abbots was Saint Babolen (died ).
In 868, King Charles the Bald invited the monks of the Abbey of Saint-Maur de Glanfeuil (in Le Thoureil, Maine-et-Loire, western France), who had fled their abbey due to Viking invasion, to relocate to &quot;Saint Pierre des Fossés&quot; with their precious relics of Saint Maurus.

Later in the Middle Ages, the relics of Saint Maurus became very famous as they were supposed to heal gout and epilepsy, and &quot;Saint Pierre des Fossés&quot; became one of the most famous pilgrimage centers of medieval France. The rededication to Saint Maurus, in which abbey was renamed Saint-Maur-des-Fossés (&quot;Saint Maurus of the Moats&quot;), was justified by the story that during a drought in 1137, prayers to the Virgin and Saints Peter and Paul having been ineffective, prayer to Saint Maur brought the needed rainfall.

===Château===
The abbey was secularised in 1535, and in 1541, the architect Philibert Delorme designed a château on the site for Cardinal Jean du Bellay, bishop of Paris, on four ranges of building around a square central court. Catherine de&#x27; Medici was a frequent visitor, preferring it to the château de Vincennes; in 1563 she acquired this &quot;château du Bellay&quot;, and substantially rebuilt it. On September 23, 1568, her teenage son, King Charles IX, issued the Edict of Saint-Maur, which prohibited all religions but Catholicism. It prompted fierce religious intolerance in Paris and eventually led to the 1572, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. Building projects at the site were only interrupted by Catherine&#x27;s death (1589); the château was sold to the Condé family and was eventually completed, and furnished with extensive parterres, at the end of the seventeenth century.

The Château de Saint-Maur, still in the possession of the Condé family, was nationalised during the French Revolution, emptied of its contents, and its terrains divided up among real-estate speculators. The structure was demolished for the value of its materials; virtually nothing remains.

===Village===
The little settlement that grew around the abbey, known as Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, developed a market during the thirteenth century. The present territory also includes a formerly distinct village, La Varenne-Saint-Hilaire, against the perimeter of the nearby game preserve of Saint-Hilaire, part of the abbey&#x27;s domaines.

In 1791, part of the territory of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés was detached and became the commune of &quot;La Branche-du-Pont-de-Saint-Maur&quot;, later renamed Joinville-le-Pont.

After the abbey itself was abandoned, its church providing building materials in the town. During the French Revolution, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés was temporarily renamed &quot;Vivant-sur-Marne&quot; (meaning &quot;Alive upon Marne&quot;) in a gesture of rejection of religion.

After the Revolution, the official name of the commune was simply Saint-Maur; it is only in 1897 that &quot;des-Fossés&quot; was re-added to the name, probably to conform to the historical name and also to distinguish Saint-Maur-des-Fossés from other communes of France also called Saint-Maur. In 1924, a few vestiges of the abbey were collected in the newly established Musée du vieux Saint-Maur. The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1876, although the side pavilions were added later.

<doc id="473619" wikidata="Q2750576" url="?curid=473619" title="List of fictional spacecraft">
<text>This is a list of fictional spacecraft, starships and exo-atmospheric vessels that have been identified by name in notable published works of fiction. The term &quot;spacecraft&quot; is mainly used to refer to spacecraft that are real or conceived using present technology. The terms &quot;spaceship&quot; and &quot;starship&quot; are generally applied only to fictional space vehicles, usually those capable of transporting people.

Spaceships are often one of the key plot devices in science fiction. Numerous short stories and novels are built up around various ideas for spacecraft, and spacecraft have featured in many films and television series. Some hard science fiction books focus on the technical details of the craft. Some fictional spaceships have been referenced in the real world, notably Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;Star Trek&quot; which gave its name to Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; and to the VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.
For other ships from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Robotech&quot;, and other major franchises, see the separate lists linked below.

<text>Robert Eugene Richards (February 20, 1926 – February 26, 2023) was an American athlete, minister, and politician. He made three U.S. Olympic Teams in two events: the 1948, 1952, and 1956 Summer Olympics as a pole vaulter and as a decathlete in 1956. He won gold medals in pole vault in both 1952 and 1956, becoming the first male two-time champion in the event in Olympic history (a feat only equalled in 2024 by Armand Duplantis).

While still an active athlete, Richards became an ordained minister. He ran for President of the United States in 1984 on the Populist Party ticket.

==Athletic career==
Richards was the second man to pole vault 15 ft (4.57 m). While a student at the University of Illinois, Richards tied for the national collegiate pole vault title and followed that with 20 national Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, including 17 in the pole vault and three in the decathlon. The first man to clear 15 feet was Dutch Warmerdam, who set the world record of in 1942, long before Richards came into his prime. While Richards was the dominant vaulter of his time, he never set a world record.

Richards later became involved in promoting physical fitness and continued to vault in his later years. He was the first athlete to appear on the front of Wheaties cereal boxes in 1958 (though not the first depicted on all parts of the packaging), and also was the first Wheaties spokesman, setting up the Wheaties Sports Federation, which encouraged participation in Olympic sports. Richards had four sons who were also pole vaulters: Brandon, held the national high school record at 18&#x27;2&quot; for fourteen years from 1985; Tom won the CIF California State Meet in 1988; and Bob Jr. was second in the same meet in 1968 and later in 1973 ranked #7 in the United States.

Richards was the only male two-time Olympic gold medal winner in the pole vault (1952 and 1956), until Armando Duplantis of Sweden matched that same feat (2021 and 2024). He also won a bronze medal in the pole vault at the 1948 summer games. Russian Yelena Isinbayeva is the only other pole vaulter besides Richards to have won three Olympic medals in the pole vault, which she completed in 2012. Richards placed 13th in the decathlon at the 1956 Olympics.

Richards was elected to the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1983 and the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1975. As he aged, Richards continued participating in track and field in a variety of events, particularly throwing events. He was one of the first regular participants in the origins of what now has become Masters athletics. 
Richards appeared on the panel game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; episode #346 January 20, 1957.

==Ministry==

Richards was ordained in 1946 as a minister in the Church of the Brethren (which led to his being nicknamed the &quot;Vaulting Vicar&quot; or the &quot;Pole Vaulting Parson&quot;). As future tennis player Billie Jean King&#x27;s church minister, Richards inspired King. One day, when King was 13 or 14, Richards asked her, &quot;What are you going to do with your life?&quot; She said: &quot;Reverend, I&#x27;m going to be the best tennis player in the world.&quot; In 1957 the actor Hal Stalmaster played Richards as a teenager in an episode of the ABC anthology series &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;.

==Political career==
In the 1984 United States presidential election, Richards ran for President of the United States on the far-right, white nationalist Populist Party ticket. He and running mate Maureen Salaman earned 66,324 votes.

==Personal life==
Richards met his first wife, Mary Leah Cline, at Bethany Biblical Seminary in 1946. The couple had three children: Carol, Bobby, and Paul. Richards met his second wife, Vonda Joan &quot;Joni&quot; Beaird, a singer and actress who played Kookie&#x27;s girlfriend on &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, when she auditioned for a role in a film Richards was producing. They wed in 1970, and had three children: Brandon, Tommy, and Tammy. Joni was a gourmet cook and co-business partner with Richards in all of his business interests; she preceded Richards, dying on September 20, 2019.

The family home was on Richards beloved Crossbar Ranch in Santo, Texas. In 2012, Richards and Joni retired to Waco, Texas, where as an enthusiastic golfer he owned Lake Waco Golf Club, and collected low volume classic cars.

==Death==
Richards died on February 26, 2023, six days after his 97th birthday.

== Awards ==
Richards was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2000 in the area of Sports. Richards is referenced in the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary &quot;Survive and Advance&quot;, for the impact he had on former N.C. State coach Jim Valvano. Valvano cites hearing Richards speak when he was a teen and the motivational messages he implored. Richards was inducted into the National Fitness Hall of Fame in 2009 and was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Association Hall of Fame (Class of 2017).

<text>Southern Illinois is a region of the U.S. state of Illinois comprising the southern third of the state, principally south of Interstate 70. Part of downstate Illinois, it is bordered by the two most voluminous rivers in the United States: the Mississippi below its connection with the Missouri River to the west and the Ohio River to the east and south, with the tributary Wabash River, extending the southeastern border. Some areas of Southern Illinois are known historically as Little Egypt.

Southern Illinois&#x27; most populated city is Belleville at 44,478. Other principal cities include Alton, Centralia, Collinsville, Edwardsville, Glen Carbon, Godfrey, Granite City, O&#x27;Fallon, Harrisburg, Herrin, West Frankfort, Mt. Vernon, Marion, and Carbondale, where the main campus of Southern Illinois University is located. Residents may also commute to St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Evansville, Indiana; and Paducah, Kentucky. The region is home to Scott Air Force Base, a major military installation.

The area has a population of 1.2 million people, who live mostly in rural towns and cities separated by extensive farmland and the Shawnee National Forest. The two higher density areas of population are Metro East (pop. 700,000+), which is the partly industrialized Illinois portion of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and the Carbondale–Marion–Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area, centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.
The first European settlers were French colonists in the part of their North American territory called Illinois Country. Later settlers migrated from the Upland South of the United States, traveling by the Ohio River. The region was affiliated with the southern agricultural economy, based on enslaved African Americans as workers on major plantations, and rural culture. Some settlers owned slaves before the territory was organized and slavery was prohibited. Many areas developed an economy based on coal mining. 

Although part of the Midwest, certain areas of Southern Illinois more closely align culturally with neighboring parts of the Upland South (i.e. Kentucky, Tennessee, Southern Indiana, and Missouri).

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest inhabitants of Illinois are thought to have arrived about 12,000 BC. They were indigenous hunter-gatherers, but they also developed their own system of agriculture. After AD 1000, the production of agricultural surpluses resulted in the development of complex, hierarchical societies. With the rise of the Mississippian culture in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, tribal leaders organized thousands of workers to build complex urban areas featuring numerous large earthworks – pyramidal, ridgetop and conical mounds used for religious, political and ceremonial purposes. Cahokia, located within the boundaries of present-day Collinsville, Illinois, was the major regional center of this culture. It contains the largest prehistoric earthworks in the Americas, and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mound builders&#x27; culture seems to have collapsed between AD 1400–1500. The Mississippians had abandoned Cahokia long before the first European explorers arrived.

The Illinois tribes, for whom the state is named, and other historic tribes migrated to Southern Illinois around AD 1500. Archaeologists say they were not descendants of the earlier inhabitants; they spoke an Algonquian language of Miami-Illini, shared in dialects among neighboring regional tribes. They had likely migrated from eastern areas, where Algonquian-language tribes emerged along the Atlantic Coast and waterways. The Illini left numerous artifacts, including burial sites, burned-out campfires along the bases of bluffs, pottery, flint implements, and weapons. Structures built by them include stone forts or &quot;pounds&quot;. Visitors can see a stone fort in Giant City State Park near Makanda. At least eight other such structures are known in the region.

===Illinois Country===

In about 1673, French explorers from Quebec became the first Europeans to reach Illinois. The French named the area Illinois after the Indians who had greeted them. The French explored the Mississippi River, establishing outposts and seeking a route to the Pacific Ocean and the Far East. As increasing Indian unrest and warfare began in Northern Illinois over the lucrative fur trade along the Great Lakes, the French concentrated on building outposts in Southern Illinois. The earliest European settlers were concentrated along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash rivers, which provided easy routes for travel and trade. The settlements including Cahokia town, Kaskaskia and Chartres became important market villages and supply depots between Canada and the French ports on the lower Mississippi River. Other important early outposts in Southern Illinois were at Old Shawneetown and Fort Massac on the Ohio River.

After defeating the French in the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) and signing the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the English ruled the Great Lakes region. At the time, many French settlers moved from towns on the eastern side of the Mississippi to the western side, which was ruled by Spain after the war. It took over all the Louisiana Territory west of the river. During the American Revolutionary War, the Southern Illinois area was the scene of the best known campaign in what was then the American west, when Virginians sought to occupy it against the British.

===American settlers===

European-American settlers were slow to arrive in Illinois after the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War. By 1800, fewer than 2,000 European Americans lived in Illinois. Soon more settlers came from the backwoods areas of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. They were mostly of English, German, and Scots-Irish descent.
In 1787, the federal government included Illinois in the Northwest Territory, an unorganized area that included present-day Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Slavery was prohibited in this area, but for some time, slaveholders already in the area were allowed to keep their chattel property. As the areas became more populated with European Americans, they could be admitted as states to the Union. Illinois became a part of the Indiana Territory in 1800. Illinois settlers wanted more control over their own affairs and Illinois became a separate territory in 1809. It was admitted as a free state in 1818. In late 1811 and early 1812, the New Madrid earthquakes struck the region as one of the largest successions of earthquakes, including the most intensive ever inferred (not recorded) in the contiguous United States.

The first bank to be chartered in Illinois was located at Old Shawneetown in 1816. The first building used solely to house a bank in Illinois was built in 1840 in Old Shawneetown and was used until the 1920s. The Old Shawneetown State Bank has been restored as an historical site. Crops of cotton and tobacco were grown in the extreme southern region of Illinois. Cotton was grown mostly for the home weaver, but during the Civil War, cotton was also grown for export, as the regular supply of cotton from the South was not available. Enough tobacco was grown to make it a profitable crop for export. Both crops have been succeeded by other agricultural commodities.

===19th century turbulence===
A feud between families in Williamson County, called the Bloody Vendetta, lasted nearly ten years and took many lives. In all, 495 assaults with a deadly weapon were committed and 285 murders took place in Williamson County between 1839 and 1876.

In 1858, Abraham Lincoln ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas. A series of debates were held in seven towns in Illinois, including Jonesboro and Alton. Many of the people living in Southern Illinois were first- or second-generation white Southerners. Many of these families had left the slave South to escape the economic institution of slavery despite retaining its racial ideologies. Cairo, Illinois, at the southern tip where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi, grew to considerable commercial importance. On either bank of the rivers were states which, despite remaining loyal to the national government throughout the secession crisis, had numerous residents who, for reasons predominately rooted in racial ideologies, were sympathetic to the Southern rebellion (1860–65). Some prominent Southern Illinoisans were active in the Knights of the Golden Circle, which proposed a southern pan-Caribbean confederation of slaveholding states and nations.

The outbreak of the American Civil War exacerbated sectional tensions in the region. While the vast majority of Southern Illinoisans who served did so as U.S. volunteers, 34 men from the counties of Williamson and Jackson traveled to western Tennessee to enlist within Company G of the 15th Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Far more served in the ranks of U.S. regiments like the 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry (commanded by famed Southern Illinoisan John A. Logan) or 111th Illinois Volunteer Infantry, both of which were composed exclusively of Southern Illinoisans. Ulysses S. Grant was commander of the District of Cairo when U.S. forces staged expeditions into the border states of Missouri and Kentucky, and the Confederate states of Tennessee and Mississippi. Despite the Southern roots of many Southern Illinoisans, 40% of eligible Southern Illinois men joined the Union Army, compared to 28% in the rest of the state. 

===20th century ===
Coal mining became an important industry in Southern Illinois around the start of the 20th century, with cities such as Harrisburg prospering, having a population of 16,000 people during the 1920s. Union miners all over the nation went on strike in 1922; during this period, 24 men were killed during a riot in Herrin, in Williamson County. It was called the Herrin Massacre, and the county was known as Bloody Williamson for years to come.

The Shelton Brothers Gang and Charles Birger gangs operated in Southern Illinois in the 1920s during Prohibition. Shoot-outs between these and other rival gangsters and with law enforcement officers were common. After being convicted of ordering the murder of the mayor of West City, the leader of the Birger gang, Charlie Birger, was hanged in 1928. In 1925 the Tri-State Tornado was the deadliest on record, devastating the city of Murphysboro and killing 234 people, the most in a single city in U.S. history.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused coal miners to lose their jobs as most mines closed. Farmers could not sell their crops and lost their land; families defaulted on home mortgage loans; and young people from the region began leaving for the cities to find work. After World War II, employment started to rise within the region, but unemployment continued to be a problem for the rural region for decades afterward. When the Clean Air Act of 1990 required many utility companies in the United States to switch to low-sulfur coal for the health of the nation, lacking affordable technology to clean the coal, the Southern Illinois region lost markets and the economy suffered. However, demand for high-sulfur coal mined in the region has rebounded in the 2010s. Agriculture has since become the main economic driver for the Southern Illinois region.

Southern Illinois is gaining a cultural identity apart from its neighbors, as previously-dispersed rural populations become more concentrated around the cities of Marion and Belleville. Marion has grown since 1970 and in the process has been selected for Illinois&#x27; first STAR Bonds District for the Millennium Development, a project designed for a city ten times its size.

Populations among the smaller cities and towns have dropped as people moved to the Carbondale-Herrin-Marion combined statistical area and Metro East.

===Origin of &quot;Little Egypt&quot; name===
In 1799, Baptist minister John Badgley dubbed the fertile highlands and bottoms near Edwardsville the &quot;Land of Goshen&quot;. Early Edwardsville was known as Goshen. This was a biblical reference to Ancient Egypt. Geographic features such as the Mississippi and its flood plains were like the fertile Nile valley. The Indian mounds of the area were large at the time and seemed like the pyramids of Egypt. The nickname stuck, and it was reinforced by other events.

In the 1830s, poor harvests in the north of the state drove people to Southern Illinois to buy grain. Others say it was because the land of the great Mississippi and Ohio River valleys were like that of Egypt&#x27;s Nile Delta. According to Hubbs, the nickname dates back to 1818, when a huge tract of land was purchased at the confluence of the rivers and its developers named it Cairo . Today, the town of Cairo still stands on the peninsula where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi.

Other settlements in the area were also given names with Egyptian, Greek, or Middle Eastern origins: The Southern Illinois University Salukis sports teams and towns such as Metropolis, Thebes, Dongola, Palestine, Lebanon, New Athens, Sparta, and Karnak show the influence of classical culture. (Greek names were also related to the contemporary national pride in the new republic of the early 19th century, and were given to towns throughout the Midwest.)

Although Illinois was a free state before the American Civil War, some residents in the area known as Egypt still owned slaves. Illinois law generally forbade bringing slaves into Illinois, but a special exemption was given to the salt works near Equality. In addition, an exception was made for slaveholders who held long-term indentured servants or descendants of slaves in the area before it achieved statehood.

The Underground Railroad also operated in southern Illinois, moving nearly equally northward and southward with bounties available for returned slaves appealing to the residents there. Slaves were going to &quot;Canaan&quot;, the land of milk and honey, for which at first glance &quot;Egypt&quot; would be an easy mistake. Directions to Underground Railroad travelers were coded in Bible verses or songs, and the story of Moses fleeing Egypt was certainly used as an analog to their own plight. Egypt was the land to escape, and central Illinois represented the biblical Canaan, with Egypt being a treacherous southern Illinois.

The nicknames for this region also arose from the political tensions of the American Civil War period, as regions of the state allied differently with North and South. Because southern Illinois was settled by Southerners, they maintained a sympathy for many issues of their former home states. They supported the continuation of slavery and voted for Democrats at a time when the northern part of the state supported Republicans. The meaning is expressed in this description of the 1858 campaign of Douglas and Abraham Lincoln:

In 1858, debating in northern Illinois, Douglas had threatened Lincoln by asserting that he would &#x27;trot him down to Egypt&#x27; and there challenge him to repeat his antislavery views before a hostile crowd. The audience understood Douglas: overwhelming proslavery sentiment and Democratic unanimity in Egypt had led to the nickname.

In the fall of 1861, Democrats took a majority of seats in the state legislature. They worked to pass provisions of a new constitution, an initiative begun in 1860. They proposed reapportionment so the southern region&#x27;s less populous counties would have representation equal to those in the north, which was growing more rapidly. Northern Illinois residents worried about the state coming under the political will of the southern minority. &quot;Shall the manufacturing, agricultural and commercial interests of northern Illinois be put into Egyptian bondage?&quot; wondered the &quot;Aurora Beacon&quot;.&quot; When Lincoln commissioned the Southern Illinois Democrat, John Alexander McClernand, as a brigadier general, he told him to &quot;keep Egypt right side up&quot;.

In addition, southern Illinois had become the center of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret group devoted to supporting the Confederacy. With concern rising about armed southern sympathizers, in August 1862, U.S. Marshal David Phillips arrested several Democrats who allegedly belonged to the Knights, including men in respectable positions: Congressmen, state representatives, and judges. One was Circuit Judge Andrew Duff. They were sent to Washington, D.C., where they were held for 68 days before release, but they were never charged. Democrats won across the state in the fall election.

After the war, other reasons were proposed for the nickname. Political divisions continued in the state. In the later 19th century, the central and southern agricultural areas joined the Populist Movement. Chicago and the industrial North aligned with similar areas and continued as predominantly Republican into the 20th century.

In 1871 Judge Andrew Duff wrote an article in which he ignored the war years and preceding political divisions. He claimed the name of Egypt related to Southern Illinois&#x27; role in supplying grain to northern and central Illinois following the &quot;Winter of the Deep Snow&quot; in 1830–31. Following a long winter and late spring, Upper Illinois lost much of its harvest in an early September frost. Southern Illinois&#x27;s weather gave it good crops, so it could ship grain and corn north. The nickname supposedly arose from similarities of the events to the Bible story of Jacob&#x27;s sons going to Egypt for grain to survive a famine. The nickname persisted through the 1890s, when, according to progressive journalist and Toledo mayor Brand Whitlock, members of the Illinois General Assembly whose districts lay south of the O&amp;M Railway were called &quot;Egyptians.&quot;

Belly dancer Farida Mazar Spyropoulos&#x27; appearance as &quot;Little Egypt&quot; at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago brought notoriety to the name, but she had no connection to the Illinois region. Other dancers took up the stage name which popularized it further in the early 20th century.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase &quot;Little Egypt&quot; is found in the &quot;Troy Weekly Call&quot; of Troy, Illinois, in 1912. A state news brief was headlined, &quot;Two New Little Egypt Pastors.&quot; about two new Presbyterian pastors about to be installed at Brookport and Salem, Illinois. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; appears to have first used the phrase &quot;Little Egypt&quot; in reference to Southern Illinois on April 25, 1920 in an article about fruit grown in the region. The title character in the comic strip &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; had a girlfriend named Little Egypt. The strip&#x27;s creator Frank Willard, was a native of Anna and Southern Illinois.

==Microregions==
===Northern boundary===
&quot;Southern Illinois&quot; is not a formal geographic designation and definitions of what constitutes Southern Illinois vary. Many Southern Illinois residents consider the area along and south of Interstate 70 as the dividing line between the Central and Southern parts of the state. The geography of Illinois becomes gradually hillier as one travels farther South. One can see this driving south along Interstate 57. The Mattoon/Charleston area is fairly flat. Terrain becomes noticeably less flat as one gets to Effingham. Around and south of Effingham on the interstate, one sees more trees and terrain that is too hilly for most large farms.

===Metro East===

The most populous region of Southern Illinois is the Illinois side of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. Noted areas are Cahokia Mounds, the American Bottom, and East St. Louis, which has had a turbulent history related to industrialization and labor, immigration and the struggle for equal rights.

==Television and radio==
Southern Illinois is home to a variety of television and radio sources. The primary news station is WSIL-TV operating out of Carterville, Illinois. The region is also home to WSIU channel 8 in Carbondale Illinois. Some Southern Illinois radio stations are run off of River Radio who operates 101.5 CIL-FM, Magic 95.1, New Country Z-100, WGGH, 97.7FM, among others. Withers Broadcasting and Dana Communications operate sixteen radio stations in Southern Illinois including WMIX 94.1 in Mt. Vernon and WDDD 107.3 in the Marion-Carbondale area. Viewers also tune in to WSIL 3 operating in Carterville, IL, KFVS 12 out of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and WPSD 6 operating in Paducah, Kentucky.

==Geography==
Illinois has been partially covered at times by continental ice sheets. Specifically, Southern Illinois was only partially covered by continental ice sheet during the Illinoian Stage and not at all during the Wisconsin Stage. Thus, the geography of Southern Illinois is considerably more hilly and rocky than central or northern Illinois. Areas of Southern Illinois are more similar to the Ozarks than to central or northern Illinois.
Additionally, the rich farm land of northern and central Illinois is generally not found in Southern Illinois. Significant exceptions are the American Bottom along the Mississippi River and the alluvial soils of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a large region that has its northernmost extent in the two river valleys of Southern Illinois.

The region&#x27;s other major river, the Ohio River, winds generally southwest, past Shawneetown, Cave-in-Rock, Elizabethtown, and Golconda. Its waters join the Mississippi at Cairo. In ancient times, the Ohio is thought to have flowed a more northerly course through Pope and Pulaski counties. It carved a broad valley there, fit for a major river. But today the underfit Bay Creek and Cache River occupy those valleys.

The hills of Little Egypt can be divided into two areas. The western area, more closely related to the Ozarks of Missouri, is chiefly in southern Jackson, Union, northern Alexander and Johnson counties. The eastern area, more closely related to the Wabash Valley seismic zone, is mostly in northern Pope, southern Saline, Gallatin, eastern Johnson and southern Williamson counties. The Shawnee National Forest covers a large territory, including seven wilderness areas: Garden of the Gods, Bay Creek, Clear Springs, Bald Knob, Burden Falls, Lusk Creek, and Panthers Den.

Of southern Illinois&#x27; rivers, only the Mississippi and the Ohio are navigable for modern commerce. The Big Muddy River, Marys River, Saline River and Cache River run their courses in deep southern Illinois. The Kaskaskia River and Wabash River are nearby.

===Shawnee National Forest===
More than of Shawnee National Forest lie to the south of its gateway city Harrisburg. The Shawnee National Forest offers much to see and do. The national forest has of roadways, some of streams and frequent waterfalls, numerous ponds and lakes as large as (some with swimming beaches), 13 campgrounds, many picnicking sites, and seven wilderness areas where trails are designed for hiking and horseback riding.

Plant life is extremely diverse and ranges from sun-loving species to those that grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the publicly owned land, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant land. More than 500 wildlife species can be found in the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 47 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.

===Climate===
Southern Illinois lies on the border between humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The region has neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature and, thus, it is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico and, along with the rest of the midwestern United States, is home to some of the largest temperature extremes in the world. The region has four distinct seasons. Spring is the wettest season and produces erratic severe weather ranging from tornadoes to winter storms. Summers are hot and humid with only occasional and brief respite, and the humidity often makes the heat index rise to temperatures feeling well above . Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first snow flurries usually forming in late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow and temperatures often below freezing, however thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, such as Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, can bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets, and snowfall.

The normal high temperature in July is 90 °F (32 °C), and the normal low temperature in January is 21 °F (−6 °C), although this varies from year to year. Both and temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. The official record low is on February 2, 1884 in Harrisburg, and the record high is on July 14, 1954 in East St. Louis.

Southern Illinois experiences thunderstorms about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms contribute over half of the annual precipitation. Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes. Southern Illinois has been affected on more than one occasion by particularly damaging tornadoes.

A period of warm weather late in autumn known as Indian summer can occur – roses will still be in bloom as late as November or early December in some years.

===Seismic zones===

Southern Illinois sits upon the verging point of two major fault systems, the New Madrid seismic zone and the Wabash Valley seismic zone. In the 1970s after the 5.4 Richter magnitude scale 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists realized that there was an unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth&#x27;s rock, in the Southern Illinois Basin. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic, coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.

A fault plane solution of the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north–south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east–west axis of confining stress. Although there are no confirmed faults in the immediate epicentral region, the motion indicated corresponds to that along the Wabash Valley seismic zone roughly east of the region, responsible for the 2008 Illinois earthquake. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.

==Transportation==

===Passenger rail===

Southern Illinois at one time had an extensive network of railroads. Now only Amtrak, the U.S. passenger rail system, provides service to and through the area. Carbondale is served with three trains daily to and from Chicago, and one train daily to and from Memphis and New Orleans. Several trains each day run to and from Chicago and St. Louis, with Alton the major stop in Southern Illinois. Intercity passenger rail stations in Southern Illinois include Alton station, Carbondale station, Centralia station, and Du Quoin station.

The St. Louis MetroLink is the light rail transit system in the Greater St. Louis area of Missouri and Illinois connecting the Metro East to downtown St. Louis. The entire system currently consists of two lines (Red Line and Blue Line) connecting Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and Shrewsbury, Missouri with Scott Air Force Base near Shiloh, Illinois, through downtown St. Louis. The system features 37 stations and carries an average of 61,573 people each weekday.

===Transit===

===Interstate freeways===
The Metro East area near St. Louis has these additional freeways:
* Interstate 55
* Interstate 70
* Interstate 255
* Interstate 270

Southern Illinois has 4 major interstate freeways that connect with Missouri, Indiana, and Kentucky. Depending on the definition of Little Egypt&#x27;s boundaries, there are four interstates in the region. I-57 is the main north–south freeway through Southern Illinois. It runs through the center of the area. South of Marion is the western terminus of I-24. It runs southeast, crossing into Paducah, Kentucky near Metropolis. South of its junction with I-24, I-57 bends to the southwest and crosses into Missouri near Illinois&#x27; southernmost point by Cairo. I-70 runs east–west from St. Louis to central Indiana. I-64 runs east–west from St. Louis to southern Indiana. It is cosigned with I-57 for a short stretch at Mt. Vernon.

===U.S. highways===
*U.S. Route 40
*U.S. Route 45 runs from the Brookport Bridge across the Ohio River east of Paducah, Kentucky, and through Shawnee National Forest. Saline County, Illinois is its most populated stretch in Southern Illinois, connecting the towns of Stonefort, Carrier Mills, Harrisburg, and Eldorado, all within the county. The highway continues north through the Chicago metropolitan area and to the Wisconsin border east of Antioch. With a length of in Illinois, U.S. 45 is the longest numbered route in Illinois.
*U.S. Route 50
*U.S. Route 51 roughly follows the Illinois Central Railroad line north–south through the middle of the entire state. Illinois Route 1 runs north–south along the eastern edge of Little Egypt; Illinois Route 3 parallels the Mississippi River along the western edge of the area.

==Historical politics==
Southern Illinois has historically been a conservative Democratic region. In the early months of the Civil War, some residents in Williamson County voted for secession from the Union. On April 15, 1861 the citizens of Marion passed a resolution calling for the division of Illinois and the secession of Southern Illinois. The resolution was soon repealed, but General Benjamin Prentiss left a company of men near Marion for defense as he passed by on his way to a garrison in Cairo. Despite some southern sympathizers, most young men in the region joined the Union Army.

Democratic roots in Southern Illinois relate to the region&#x27;s shared culture with the South, where the Democratic Party before the American Civil War and after Reconstruction was dominant until the 1960s. Democratic affiliations were strengthened during the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. There are, however, some long-time Republican counties in the region, most notably, Edwards County.

However, within the last few decades, Southern Illinois has trended GOP due to nationwide support for the GOP among rural areas, while Northern Illinois due to outward migration from Democratic-leaning Cook County has trended Democratic. Democratic candidates were competitive in the counties of Southern Illinois until around 1996. Beginning as recently as the presidential election of 2000, Democrats have under-performed in Southern Illinois despite winning Illinois consecutively.

==Economy==

There are two main centers of commerce for Southern Illinois. They consist of the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area (home to approximately 2.8 million people), and the Carbondale, Marion, Herrin, Harrisburg area (home to approximately 245,000 people).

The main agricultural products of Southern Illinois are crops such as corn and soybeans. Apples, peaches, grapes, are commonly found throughout Southern Illinois as well as the occasional sunflower, cotton, wheat, hay, and milo fields. In recent years there has been development of wineries in the Shawnee Hills region. Additional growth has occurred with the local foods movement as Southern Illinois&#x27; climate allows for fruit and vegetable production. Southern Illinois is also the home to aquaculture, beef, swine, equine, sheep, goats, and other livestock production. Agricultural efforts in the region are greatly aided by a small University of Illinois Extension research station near Dixon Springs and extensive research from Southern Illinois University – Carbondale&#x27;s College of Agricultural Sciences. SIUC is home to the state&#x27;s only non-land grant research-focused university with an agricultural college which provides practical research to the scientific and agricultural communities both in Southern Illinois as well as the rest of the state and the broader region.

Southern Illinois also has significant coal deposits; however, since the late 1980s, the coal industry has suffered significant decline due to the decreased demand for high-sulfur coal, which causes more pollution. The collapse of the coal industry had profound and lasting impact on the region&#x27;s economy. With the introduction and application of scrubber technology at power plants, demand for high-sulfur has made a return in the 2010s.

The Illinois oil basin is located mostly in Little Egypt. During the early 1940s and 1950s, Little Egypt had a modest oil boom in towns such as Carmi, McLeansboro, and Lawrenceville. Oil production reached more than per year in the 1940s, but dropped to per year by 1995. Oil wells in the region have relatively low yield and produce oil with a high sulfur content, making it expensive to process. There has been no significant drilling activity in the basin since the late 1970s.

Manufacturing in Southern Illinois is typically clustered in the largest towns of each county, with the people of smaller towns and villages often commuting to work in the factories. Many of these towns have a number of light factories and other industrial facilities in their industrial parks. Products include industrial electronics, minor electrical items, automobile parts, and packaging materials. Related services include large-scale printing as well as transportation and distribution of warehoused materials and goods. A high percentage of local jobs are in these light industries.

==Culture==
Southern Illinois is influenced culturally by the rest of Illinois, neighboring Missouri and Indiana, and Upper Southern states like Kentucky and Tennessee. The immigration route from the east coast ran along the Ohio River, which joined settlements on both sides. In addition, the Cumberland River flowed northwest through Kentucky and Tennessee before joining the Ohio near Paducah, Kentucky, affording a migration route from the interior of those states. Thus, settlers who came to Southern Illinois were from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, with most of these being of northern English and Scots-Irish descent, who formed the last major migration from the British Isles to the colonies before the Revolutionary War, and settled mostly in the backcountry. Some migrated further west into Missouri. A road between Golconda and Jonesboro carried settlers and commerce across Southern Illinois, as well as the Cherokee on the Trail of Tears.

Little Egypt exists at the confluence of the North Midland and South Midland dialects of American English. South Midland becomes more prominent as one approaches the Ohio River. The dialect change is not a continuum, but rather occurs in pockets, with certain towns and regions notably favoring one dialect over the other. This difference can be found between lifelong residents of the same town. No stigma is associated to either dialect within southern Illinois. According to David Hackett Fischer in his book &quot;Albion&#x27;s Seed: Four British Folkways to America&quot;, the dialect of this region is Southern Highland. It was derived from the linguistics of the people of the Southern Appalachian region. This is consistent with the majority of the early settlers of this region migrating from the Upper South. The older term for this type of dialect was &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; speech (the correct term today is Scots-Irish.)

===Tourism===
Southern Illinois prides itself in tourism as a quaint rural area. There are many state parks in the area, benefiting from the scenery of the Shawnee National Forest. Additionally, Southern Illinois is the oldest part of the state with many historical landmarks to be seen in the area and numerous historical markers dotting the counties.

<text>The vertical viola, alto violin or upright viola, is a stringed instrument with the range of a viola that is played vertically in the manner of a cello. It is the fourth-highest member of the violin octet (after the treble, soprano, and mezzo violins).

The standard viola is about as big as can conveniently be played under the chin. The physicist/instrument maker Carleen Hutchins, working during the 1960s, reasoned that a viola played vertically could be made larger, and that a larger viola might produce a better sound. Based on principles of instrument design she had observed in top-quality existing instruments, Hutchins designed a viola about longer than the regular viola, intended to be played vertically like a cello. (Despite Hutchins&#x27;s original intention, a few violists have played her viola horizontally.)

The fundamental acoustic principle underlying the vertical viola is that the main body resonance (resonance of the wood of the instrument) should match the second-highest string, and the main cavity resonance (resonance of the air the instrument contains) should match the third-highest string. On a viola these strings are D and G, respectively. The standard viola is too small to achieve this matchup of string frequency to resonance frequency.

The same design principle was used by Hutchins to design a complete family of eight stringed instruments, commonly called the violin octet, of which the vertical viola has been the most successful. Since all of the instruments are designed based on the violin, Hutchins gave the name &quot;alto violin&quot; to her vertical viola design.

Hutchins&#x27;s instrument has attracted admiration for its power and beauty of tone. The cellist Yo-Yo Ma has employed a Hutchins vertical viola to perform and record Béla Bartók&#x27;s Viola Concerto.

<text>Rashid Alievich Sunyaev (, ; born 1 March 1943 in Tashkent, USSR) is a German, Soviet, and Russian astrophysicist of Tatar descent. He got his MS degree from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) in 1966. He became a professor at MIPT in 1974. Sunyaev was the head of the High Energy Astrophysics Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and has been chief scientist of the Academy&#x27;s Space Research Institute since 1992. He has also been a director of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany since 1996, and Maureen and John Hendricks Distinguished Visiting Professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton since 2010. In February 2022, he signed an open letter from Russian scientists and science journalists condemning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Works==
Sunyaev and Yakov B. Zeldovich developed the theory for the evolution of density fluctuations in the early universe. They predicted the pattern of acoustic fluctuations that have been clearly seen by WMAP and other CMB experiments in the microwave sky and in the large-scale distribution of galaxies. Sunyaev and Zeldovich stated in their 1970 paper, &quot;A detailed investigation of the spectrum of fluctuations may, in principle, lead to an understanding of the nature of initial density perturbations since a distinct periodic dependence of the spectral density of perturbations on wavelength (mass) is peculiar to adiabatic perturbations.&quot; CMB experiments have now seen this distinctive scale in temperature and polarization measurements. Large-scale structure observations have seen this scale in galaxy clustering measurements.

With Yakov B. Zeldovich, at the Moscow Institute of Applied Mathematics, he proposed what is known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, which is due to electrons associated with gas in galaxy clusters scattering the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Sunyaev and Nikolay I. Shakura developed a model of accretion onto black holes, from a disk, and he has proposed a signature for X-radiation from matter spiraling into a black hole. He has collaborated in important studies of the early universe, including the recombination of hydrogen and the formation of the cosmic microwave background radiation. He led the team which operated the X-ray observatory attached to the Kvant-1 module of the Mir space station and also the GRANAT orbiting X-ray observatory. Kvant made the first detection of X-rays from a supernova in 1987. His team is currently preparing the Spectrum-X-Gamma International Astrophysical Project and is working with INTEGRAL spacecraft data. At Garching he is working in the fields of theoretical high energy astrophysics and physical cosmology and participates in the data interpretation of the ESA Planck spacecraft mission.

<text>Lamium (dead-nettles) is a genus of about 30 species of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae, of which it is the type genus. They are all herbaceous plants native to Eurasia and northern Africa, with several widely naturalised across much of the temperate world.

==Description==
The genus includes both annual and perennial species; they spread by both seeds and stems rooting as they grow along the ground. They have square stems and coarsely textured pairs of leaves, often with striking patterns or variegation. They produce double-lipped flowers in a wide range of colours.

==Taxonomy==
In volume 2 of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; published in 1753, the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus established genus &quot;Lamium&quot; by recognizing four species: &quot;Lamium album&quot;, &quot;Lamium purpureum&quot;, &quot;Lamium amplexicaule&quot;, and &quot;Lamium multifidum&quot;. The name &quot;Lamium&quot; is the primary generic name in use today.

Several closely related genera were formerly included in &quot;Lamium&quot; by some botanists, including &quot;Galeopsis&quot; (hemp-nettles) and &quot;Leonurus&quot; (motherworts).

===Etymology===
The generic name &quot;Lamium&quot; was used by Pliny the Elder in the first century AD. The name comes from the Greek &quot;laimos&quot;, which means &quot;gullet&quot;, a reference to the gaping throat-like appearance of the corolla.

The common name &quot;dead-nettle&quot; has been derived from the German &quot;Taubnessel&quot; (&quot;deaf nettle&quot;, or &quot;nettle without a kernel&quot;), and refers to the resemblance of &quot;Lamium album&quot; to the very distantly related stinging nettles, but unlike those, they do not have stinging hairs and so are harmless or apparently &quot;dead&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species are native to Europe, Asia. and northern Africa, but several have become very successful weeds of crop fields and are now widely naturalised across much of the temperate world.

==Ecology==
&quot;Lamium&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, setaceous Hebrew character and the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. ballotella&quot;, &quot;C. lineolea&quot; and &quot;C. ochripennella&quot;. 

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Lamium&quot; species are widely cultivated as groundcover, and numerous cultivars have been selected for garden use. They are frost hardy and grow well in most soils. Flower colour determines planting season and light requirement: white- and purple-coloured flowered species are planted in spring and prefer full sun. The yellow-flowered ones are planted in fall (autumn) and prefer shade. They often have invasive habits and need plenty of room.

<doc id="473644" wikidata="Q6153328" url="?curid=473644" title="Janet Ellis">
<text>Janet Ellis, (born 16 September 1955) is an English television presenter, actress and writer, who is best known for presenting the children&#x27;s television programmes &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Jigsaw&quot; between 1979 and 1987. She has published two novels, &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Hook&quot; (2016) and &quot;How It Was&quot; (2019). She is the mother of three children: singer/songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, musician and former child actor Jackson Ellis-Leach and art historian Martha Ellis-Leach.

==Early life==
Ellis was born in Chatham, Kent on September 16, 1955. Her father was a soldier who was stationed during her childhood at various places in Britain and Germany. Accordingly, she attended seven schools in the two countries, including Russell House School in Otford, Kent between the ages of five and seven, St Hilary&#x27;s in Sevenoaks, Kent between the ages of 11 and 13, and from the ages of 13 to 17, her last school was Richmond County School for Girls in Richmond, Surrey (now in London).

Having expressed an interest in acting since the age of five, she applied to and was accepted by the Central School of Speech and Drama in London but because she was too young, her place was deferred for a year. She spent the year gaining experience of the acting world by working backstage at the Comedy Theatre in central London.

She has a sister, Sharon, who is two years younger than her.

==Television career==
===1978–1987===
Ellis&#x27;s first television appearance in 1978 was a small role in the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory Playhouse&quot;, followed by a bit part credited as &quot;Marge&#x27;s Friend&quot; in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; episode &quot;Hard Men.&quot;

Her big break came in 1979, when she landed the job of regular presenter of the Clive Doig-produced &quot;Jigsaw&quot;. Also that year she played the character of &quot;Teka&quot; in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Horns of Nimon&quot;. After four series in &quot;Jigsaw&quot; Ellis left to join &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 28 April 1983. During her four-year stint, she co-presented with Simon Groom, Sarah Greene, Peter Duncan, Michael Sundin, Mark Curry and Caron Keating. During the run, she became the first civilian woman in Europe to free fall from – but not before breaking her pelvis during training. Her last show was on 29 June 1987. It is sometimes claimed that Ellis was sacked from the programme for being unmarried and pregnant with son Jackson, but in recent years Ellis has stated that she was fully supported by the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; production team and the decision to leave the programme was her own.

===1988–1999===
After leaving &quot;Blue Peter&quot; Ellis scaled back her presenting commitments in order to spend time bringing up her family. During this period she presented the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Open Air&quot; programme, wrote a book entitled &quot;How to Get Married Without Divorcing Your Family&quot; with her friend and ex &quot;Blue Peter&quot; co-host Caron Keating in 1994, and provided voiceovers for numerous advertisements. She also presented the &quot;Daz Challenge&quot; in the television advertisements for three years and occasionally appeared as a co-presenter on Danny Baker&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show.

===2000–2013===
Ellis returned to the TV screen in 2000. She played a TV reporter in an episode of the first full series of &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; in 2001. She has been appearing on the Channel 5 (then known as Five) show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; since 2002 as a regular panellist, and on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Broadcasting House&quot;. She also presented &quot;Housebusters&quot; between 2003 and 2005 on Five. This was followed by the week-long documentary series &quot;Life Blood&quot; in 2004, also aired on Five, and the 2005 series of &quot;The Great Garden Challenge&quot; for Channel 4.

In January 2007, Ellis appeared on the BBC reality singing show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; partnered with Alexander O&#x27;Neal. Despite being &#x27;saved&#x27; by Stewart Copeland on the first night, on 3 January 2007 she was the second celebrity to be eliminated, after judge CeCe Sammy described her as having the vocal characteristics of &quot;a cat on speed&quot;. Ellis managed to show good humour in the face of the defeat, stating that she had had &quot;fun, a lot of fun&quot;.

In May 2008, she appeared naked in a magazine in support of PETA and in June of the same year she won &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; &quot;Blue Peter&quot; celebrity charity special. She donated the winnings of £13,150 to Maggie&#x27;s Centres, a cancer care charity.

In December 2009, Ellis narrated &quot;The Man Behind the Masquerade&quot;, a BBC documentary about Kit Williams. She was the voice of numerous Mexican gerbils in &quot;El Nombre&quot;, and has appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot; with daughter Sophie; &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; and &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot;.

In December 2010, Janet and her daughter Sophie appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Million Pound Drop Live&quot;. Also shown on Channel 4 on 22 December 2010, Ellis competed in the &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; celebrity Christmas special. The winner&#x27;s prize of £1,000 was donated to charity. Ellis won, beating singer Tony Christie and actress Susie Amy into joint second place, with musician and actor Goldie bringing up the rear.

In January 2012 Ellis returned to her first love of acting by starring in a production of Alan Bennett&#x27;s comedy play &quot;Green Forms&quot; for a week at the Tabard Theatre in Chiswick in order to raise money for Maggie&#x27;s Centres.

===2014 – present===
Following a long-held ambition to write fiction, Ellis attended a writing course in early 2014 run by the Curtis Brown agency. During the course she began writing her first novel, and after completing it her agent Gordon Wise submitted it to publishers under the pseudonym Jo Winter, the name of one of her grandmothers. A bidding war resulted in Ellis securing a six-figure two-book deal with Two Roads. The novel, &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Hook&quot;, was published under Ellis&#x27;s own name in February 2016. She was included in &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s pick of the New Faces of Fiction 2016. In November 2016 the book was shortlisted for the 2016 Bad Sex in Fiction Award.

In 2018 Ellis wrote an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper in which she characterised Blue Peter as offering &quot;...a view of a world worth growing up in&quot;.

She appeared in a play &quot;Once Seen on Blue Peter&quot; at the 2018 Edinburgh Festival. Her second novel, &quot;How It Was&quot;, was published in August 2019.

==Personal life==
Ellis met her first husband, TV director Robin Bextor, at the age of 16 and married him in 1977 when she was 21. Their daughter Sophie was born in 1979. The couple separated during her time presenting &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. She met TV producer John Leach in 1986 and their son was born in 1987. After leaving &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Ellis married Leach in 1988. He was managing director of TV production company Sunset+Vine, and they had a daughter. Leach died in July 2020. Ellis is a member of the board of Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, a patron of Maggie&#x27;s Centres, a patron of Humanists UK, and a Council and Honorary Member of the National Youth Theatre.

Ellis was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to charity and theatre.

<text>Yonatan &quot;Yoni&quot; Netanyahu (March 13, 1946 – July 4, 1976) was an Israeli military officer who commanded Sayeret Matkal during the Entebbe raid. The raid was launched in response to the 1976 hijacking of an international civilian passenger flight from Israel to France by Palestinian and German militants, who took control of the aircraft during a stopover in Greece and diverted it to Libya and then to Uganda, where they received support from Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Though Israel&#x27;s counter-terrorist operation was a success, with 102 of the 106 hostages being rescued, Netanyahu was killed in action – the only Israeli soldier killed during the crisis.

The eldest son of the Israeli professor Benzion Netanyahu, Yonatan was born in New York City and spent much of his youth in the United States, where he attended high school. After serving in the Israeli military during the Six-Day War, he briefly attended Harvard University before transferring to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1968; soon thereafter, he left his studies and returned to military service in Israel. He joined Sayeret Matkal in the early 1970s and was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service for his conduct in the Yom Kippur War. After his death, Operation Entebbe was renamed &quot;Operation Yonatan&quot; in his honor.

==Background==
Yonatan Netanyahu was born in New York City, the eldest son of Tzila (; 1912–2000) and Benzion Netanyahu (1910–2012), a professor emeritus of history at Cornell University. His mother had been born in Petah Tikva, in what is now Israel, which was then in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, while his father was born in Warsaw and immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1920. He was named after his paternal grandfather, rabbi Nathan Mileikowsky, and Colonel John Henry Patterson, who formerly commanded the Jewish Legion and attended his circumcision. His two brothers are Benjamin and Iddo. Benjamin was elected Prime Minister of Israel in 1996, in 2009 and reelected in 2013, 2015, 2020 and 2022. Iddo, the youngest of the three, is a radiologist and writer. All three brothers served in Sayeret Matkal.

Netanyahu&#x27;s family returned to the newly independent state of Israel in 1949 when he was two and settled in Jerusalem. In 1956 the family again moved to the United States before returning to Israel in 1958. Netanyahu attended high school at Gymnasia Rehavia in Jerusalem. In 1963, when he was in 11th grade, the family returned to the United States, where he attended Cheltenham High School in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. He was a classmate of Baseball Hall of Fame member Reggie Jackson. While in high school, he began contemplating his purpose in life, when he wrote in a 1963 letter, &quot;The trouble with the youth here is that their lives are meager in content. I ought to be ready at every moment of my life to confront myself and say—&#x27;This is what I&#x27;ve done&#x27;.&quot; After graduating in June 1964, he returned to Israel to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. He joined the Paratroopers Brigade and fought in the Six-Day War.

Netanyahu married his long-time girlfriend Tirza &quot;Tuti&quot; Goodman on August 17, 1967. Shortly after their wedding, they flew to the U.S., where Netanyahu enrolled at Harvard University. He took classes in philosophy and mathematics, excelling in both, and was on the Dean&#x27;s List at the end of his first year. However, feeling restless at being away from Israel, especially with Israel skirmishing against Egypt during the War of Attrition, he transferred to Jerusalem&#x27;s Hebrew University in 1968. In early 1969, he left his studies and returned to the army. His father described those decisions, saying &quot;He was dreaming of resuming his studies and planned to do so time and again. Yet he always conditioned his return to Harvard on the relaxation of the military tensions.&quot;

In 1972, he and Tuti were divorced. Netanyahu was living with his girlfriend of two years, Bruria, at the time of his death.

==Military career==
After graduating high school, Netanyahu joined the Israeli Defense Forces in 1964. He volunteered to serve in the Paratroopers Brigade, and excelled in the Officer Training Course. He was eventually given command of a paratroopers company.

In 1967 he considered college, but the constant threat of war made him stay in Israel: &quot;This is my country and my homeland. It is here that I belong,&quot; he wrote. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War, his battalion fought the battle of Um Katef in Sinai, then reinforced the Golan Heights battle. During the Golan Heights battle, he was wounded while helping rescue a fellow soldier who lay wounded deep behind enemy lines. He was decorated for valor after that war.

After being wounded, he returned to the U.S. to study at Harvard University. But after a year he felt the need to return to Israel to rejoin the army. &quot;At this time,&quot; he wrote in a letter, &quot;I should be defending my country. Harvard is a luxury I cannot afford.&quot; He next returned to Harvard in the summer of 1973, but again gave up academic life for Israel&#x27;s military.

By 1970 he was leading an anti-terrorist reconnaissance unit, Sayeret Matkal (Israeli special forces), and in the summer of 1972 was appointed as the unit&#x27;s deputy commander. That year he commanded a raid into Syria named Operation Crate 3, in which senior Syrian officers were abducted and held as bargaining chips to be later exchanged in return for captive Israeli pilots. The following year he participated in Operation Spring of Youth, in which the terrorists and leadership of Black September were selectively killed by Sayeret Matkal, Shayetet-13 and the Mossad.

During the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, Netanyahu commanded a Sayeret Matkal force in the Golan Heights that killed more than 40 Syrian commandos in a battle which thwarted the Syrian commandos&#x27; raid in the Golan&#x27;s heartland. During the same war, he also rescued Lieutenant Colonel Yossi Ben Hanan from Tel Shams, while Ben Hanan was lying wounded behind Syrian lines.

Following the war, Netanyahu was awarded Medal of Distinguished Service (), Israel&#x27;s third highest military decoration, for his rescue of Ben Hanan. Netanyahu then volunteered to serve as an armor commander, due to the heavy casualties inflicted on the Israeli Armored Corps during the war, with a disproportionate number of these in the officer ranks. Netanyahu excelled in Tank Officers course, and was given command of the Barak Armored Brigade, which had been shattered during the war. Netanyahu turned his brigade into the leading military unit in the Golan Heights. 

===Operation Entebbe===
Netanyahu was killed in action on July 4, 1976, while commanding the rescue mission during Operation Entebbe. He was the only Israeli soldier killed during the raid (along with three hostages, all of the Revolutionary Cells members, all of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine members, and dozens of Ugandan soldiers). The commonly accepted version of his death is that Netanyahu fired on Ugandan soldiers, and was shot in response by a Ugandan soldier from the airport&#x27;s control tower. His family refused to accept this verdict, and insisted instead that he was killed by the German commanding the hijackers. Netanyahu was shot outside the building being stormed, and soon died in the arms of Efraim Sneh, commander of the mission&#x27;s medical unit. The operation itself was a success, and was renamed as &quot;Mivtsa Yonatan&quot; (&quot;Operation Jonathan&quot; in English) in his honor.

Netanyahu was buried in Jerusalem&#x27;s Military Cemetery at Mount Herzl on July 6 following a military funeral attended by enormous crowds and top-ranking officials. Shimon Peres, then Defense Minister, said during the eulogy that &quot;a bullet had torn the young heart of one of Israel&#x27;s finest sons, one of its most courageous warriors, one of its most promising commanders – the magnificent Yonatan Netanyahu.&quot;

There are memorial trees that have been planted in his honor in front of his graduating high school, Cheltenham High School, and a memorial plaque is located in the lobby.

===Personal letters===
In 1980 many of Netanyahu&#x27;s personal letters were published. Author Herman Wouk describes them as a &quot;remarkable work of literature, possibly one of the great documents of our time.&quot; Many of his letters were written hurriedly under trying conditions in the field, but according to a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, give a &quot;convincing portrayal of a talented, sensitive man of our times who might have excelled at many things yet chose clearsightedly to devote himself to the practice and mastery of the art of war, not because he liked to kill or wanted to, but because he knew that, as always in human history, good is no match for evil without the power to physically defend itself.&quot;

===Biographical play and film===

&quot;To Pay the Price&quot; is a play by Peter-Adrian Cohen based in part on Netanyahu&#x27;s letters. The play, produced by North Carolina&#x27;s Theatre Or, opened off Broadway in New York in June 2009 during the Festival of Jewish Theater and Ideas. The play had been scheduled to run at the New Repertory Theatre company near Boston, Massachusetts. The run was canceled after pressure by the Netanyahu family, because the theater was intending to run the play as a companion piece to &quot;My Name Is Rachel Corrie&quot;.

The documentary film &quot;Follow Me&quot;, released in May 2012, is based on Netanyahu&#x27;s life story and his final mission, leading the successful rescue of Israeli hostages at Entebbe, at the cost of his life. The narration during the film uses transcripts from his personal letters and other spoken words.

==Legacy==

Author Herman Wouk wrote that Netanyahu was already a legend in Israel even before his death at the age of 30. Wouk wrote:He was a taciturn philosopher-soldier of terrific endurance, a hard-fibered, charismatic young leader, a magnificent fighting man. On the Golan Heights, in the Yom Kippur War, the unit he led was part of the force that held back a sea of Soviet tanks manned by Syrians, in a celebrated stand; and after Entebbe, &quot;Yoni&quot; became in Israel almost a symbol of the nation itself. Today his name is spoken there with somber reverence.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his own &quot;hard line against all terrorists&quot; came as a result of the death of his brother.

===The Jonathan Institute===
Netanyahu&#x27;s father commented in 1977 that Yoni would have been disappointed with the West&#x27;s reactions against terrorism. &quot;He would, I think, express great dismay and concern at the weakness and indecision displayed by some democracies toward this phenomenon,&quot; he said. &quot;He felt that there are principles that must be upheld if civilization itself is to survive.&quot;

In 1979, Jonathan Institute was founded by Benjamin Netanyahu to sponsor international conferences on terrorism. One of its first speakers, U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson, then Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who gave a talk titled &quot;Terrorism as a Weapon in International Politics&quot;, described the purpose of the conference and its relation to Jonathan Netanyahu. Two conferences organized by the Jonathan Institute, in Jerusalem in July 1979 and Washington, D.C. in June 1984, were attended by government officials and attracted significant press coverage.

<text>The Mainland is the main island of Shetland, Scotland. The island contains Shetland&#x27;s only burgh, Lerwick, and is the centre of Shetland&#x27;s ferry and air connections.

==Geography==
It has an area of , making it the third-largest Scottish island and the fifth largest of the British Isles after Great Britain, Ireland, Lewis and Harris and Skye. Mainland is the second most populous of the Scottish islands (only surpassed by Lewis and Harris), and had 18,765 residents in 2011 compared to 17,550 in 2001.

The mainland can be broadly divided into four sections:

*The long southern peninsula, south of Lerwick, has a mixture of moorland and farmland and contains many important archaeological sites.
**Bigton, Cunningsburgh, Sandwick, Scalloway, and Sumburgh
*The Central Mainland has more farmland and some woodland plantations.
*The West Mainland
**Aith, Walls, and Sandness
*The North Mainland – in particular the large Northmavine peninsula, connected to Mainland by a narrow isthmus at Mavis Grind – is wild, with much moorland and coastal cliffs. The North Mainland contains Sullom Voe, the location of an oil terminal providing an important source of employment for islanders.
**Brae, North Roe, and Vidlin

<doc id="473662" wikidata="Q192773" url="?curid=473662" title="Aulnay-sous-Bois">
<text>Aulnay-sous-Bois () is a commune in the Seine-Saint-Denis department in the Île-de-France region in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the Kilometre zero.

The commune has been awarded four flowers by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
===Situation===
Aulnay-sous-Bois is located in the Paris area and is 19 km north-east of Notre-Dame Cathedral, 1 km east of Le Bourget Airport, and 5 km south-west of Charles de Gaulle Airport. The commune stretches over a length of 6.5 km from north to south and a width ranging from 1.4 to 4.3 km from east to west and covers an area of 1,620 hectares.

The town is surrounded by the A3 autoroute in the west which joins the A1 autoroute in the north. Route nationale 2 passes through the heart of the commune from west to east with the N370 coming from the south-east along the eastern border to join the N2. The D44 passes through from north-west to south-east and the D115 from Bobigny in the south-west passes through the centre and continues to Villepinte in the east. The Ourcq Canal passes through the south-eastern end, adjacent to Livry-Gargan.

Distribution of urban zones is:
*Residential: 44%
*Industrial: 30%
*Housing Estates: 11%
*Natural areas (parks): 15%

===Districts===
*The north of Aulnay-sous-Bois consists of large housing estates (including the &quot;City of 3000&quot; and &quot;Milles-Milles&quot;), industrial areas (PSA Peugeot Citroën, Garonor, and O&#x27;Parinor), and parks (Robert Ballanger Park and Sausset Park):
**The &quot;Rose des Vents&quot; (also known as the &quot;City of 3000&quot; in reference to the number of dwellings constructed)
**The &quot;Etangs&quot; (Ponds) (there are the East Etangs - also called &quot;Les Nénuphars&quot;, and the West Etangs)
**The &quot;Merisier&quot;
**The &quot;City of Emmaus&quot;
**Balagny
**La Garenne
**Ambourget (also called &quot;Mitry&quot; or &quot;Mille-mille&quot;)
**Savigny
**The &quot;Gros Saule&quot; (A district categorised as a ZSP or Special Security zone)
*The central area, called the district of &quot;Vieux Pays&quot; (Old Country), is older especially with its Church of Saint-Sulpice built in the 12th century and its farm. It includes &quot;La Roseraie, Maximilien Robespierre, Le Vieux Pays, Tour Eiffel&quot;, and &quot;Hotel de Ville&quot;.
*The south, across the railway line, is wealthier and residential in nature. It consists of suburban districts and is bordered by the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq. It includes &quot;Chanteloup, Central Station, Pont de l&#x27;Union&quot;, and &quot;Nonneville&quot;.

===Rose-des-Vents===
When the construction of &quot;Clos Saint-Lazare&quot; at Stains ended, urbanization of the northern districts of Aulnay-sous-Bois began. The idea was to create an area of factories. It was on this basis that the area of &quot;Rose des Vents&quot; was built in 1969 in the northern part of Aulnay-sous-Bois. This &quot;Great Housing Estate&quot; was built on former agricultural land. Its mission was to provide shelter for workers and managers for a new Citroën plant to be located a few hundred metres away.

Beyond the &quot;Rose des Vents&quot;, which is also known as the &quot;City of 3000&quot;, all of the housing estates in the northern districts total 6,500 housing units including 745 detached houses. 24,000 people, or 30% of the population of Aulnay-sous-Bois, are housed on 4% of the territory.

===Communication routes===

====Roads====
The city is served by:
*Autoroutes: A1, A3, A104 (the Francilienne)
*National Roads: N2 and N370
*Departmental Routes: D115, D44, D40, D401

====SNCF Railway station, tramway====
The commune is traversed by the main railway line from Paris to Soissons, Laon, and Hirson which serves the Aulnay-sous-Bois station where all buses and semi-direct services of (Roissy and Mitry-Mory) and the Transilien Paris to Crépy-en-Valois (connecting with TER Villers to Cotterêts/Soissons/Laon) stop and it is the terminus of the line. The station has a park and ride with a parking fee.

Since November 2006, the classic commuter train the &quot;Ligne des Coquetiers&quot; (The Egg-cups line) between Aulnay-sous-Bois to Bondy has been replaced by a Tram-train that takes the same route and allows connection to the and . Two branches are planned: the first to Clichy-sous-Bois and Montfermeil on the Gargan heights; the second towards Garonor through Rose-des-Vents and the N370 to the heights of Rougemont-Chanteloup.

Between September 2009 to January 2011, the Aulnay-sous-Bois station has had work done to allow access to all platforms for disabled persons including: the development of four lifts, the rehabilitation of the railway station and underpasses, and the installation of new lighting. Aulnay-sous-Bois station is also served by bus routes:
* 
* 

Villepinte Station is located halfway between Aulnay-sous-Bois and Villepinte and it provides access to the district of &quot;Rose des Vents&quot;. Villepinte station is served by buses: TRA 609 615 617 642 683(RER) (B)(BUS).

====Air transport====
Aulnay-sous-Bois is located 5 km from Charles de Gaulle Airport. The airport can be reached by (4 stations) or by the A1 and A3 autoroutes.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Aulnay&quot; is a common French toponym and may derive from the Medieval Latin &quot;alnetum&quot; meaning &quot;alder grove&quot; after the alder trees () which covered Aulnay-sous-Bois in ancient times. An alternative derivation is that Aulnay takes its name from its location in &quot;pagellus alnetenis&quot; - &quot;Aulnaye Country&quot;.

&quot;Aulnoye&quot; or &quot;Aunois&quot; was a small agricultural area in Île-de-France. It included a dozen villages and hamlets scattered between thickets, meadows and woods. The village was surrounded by the &quot;Forest of Bondy&quot; which covered most of the north-east of Paris.

The location previously bore the names Aunay, Aunais, Anay, Aunoye, Aulnaye, Aulnay-la-Fosse, Aulnay-en-France (15th century), becoming Aulnay-lès-Bondy (i.e. &quot;Aulnay by Bondy&quot;) in 1787. The commune was renamed Aulnay-sous-Bois (i.e. &quot;Aulnay under the woods&quot;) on 5 January 1903 in reference to the ancient &quot;Forest of Bondy&quot;. Other nearby commune names (Clichy-sous-Bois, Les Pavillons-sous-Bois, and Rosny-sous-Bois) also refer to the same forest.

==History==
The area was originally settled around 6000 BC (remains found in the Valley of Sausset). Between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, farmers living around a &quot;villa&quot; belonging to &quot;Sabinus&quot; - the Savigny Farm. Two places independent from the parish of Saint Sulpice were Savigny and Nonneville which were attached to the current village. Until the 15th century the lords bore the name of &quot;d&#x27;Aulnay&quot;. The lord Jacques Coitier passed succession to his heirs through his nephew to the Gourgues family. The Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq was dug during the Napoleonic period to facilitate relations with Paris. Excavation began in 1803 and the canal was opened between Paris and Claye in 1813.

The register of city council meetings shows that 13 May 1814 was the first Prussian occupation of the village. There were also Prussian occupations in 1814 and 1870. Over a long period houses were destroyed and fields remained deserted. On 15 August 1838 a postal boat service was started on the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq from Paris to Meaux. This service stopped in 1849. In 1875, the French Northern Railway opened a station on the new Paris to Soissons line. The rise of Aulnay was largely due to this event. In 1883 the Parc district began to emerge in the south from a fragment of the Forest of Bondy. In the years which followed cohabitation between the rural community of &quot;Vieux-Pays&quot; (Old Country) and the more urban community of &quot;Parc&quot; was difficult. There was even talk of cutting the city in two: Aulnay-les-Bondy for Vieux-Pays and Aulnay-sous-Bois for Parc. The population of Aulnay rose from 780 inhabitants in 1885 to 1,012 in 1886. In 1896 the municipal council was mostly made up of inhabitants of Parc but undertook the development of the entire community of Aulnay. A school, a post office, streets, and bridges were built in the south. The creation of &quot;worker trains&quot; by the French Northern Railway attracted many workers to acquire land. Large properties began to fragment. &quot;Parc&quot; was sold in lots. Tempted by the greenery on the outskirts of Paris, Parisians bought land and transformed the place into a holiday and residential area.

At the beginning of the 20th century Aulnay grew through accentuation on rail traffic and installation of industries. On 5 January 1903, the city became Aulnay-sous-Bois. In September 1914 Aulnay was saved from German military occupation by the counter-offensive during the First Battle of the Marne. In 1924 the Radiator Company commenced operation and provided employment for 2,300 workers. Other small mechanical or chemical industries also moved to Aulnay. Between 1920 and 1931 most of the housing estates were completed. In 1935 the population of the housing estates represented approximately 40% of the total population of Aulnay. In 1955 the large rural area in the north of the commune began to urbanize: large multi-family housing estates were planned and built. In 1962 the first group of buildings at &quot;Merisiers&quot; was built.

In 1969 and 1970 a housing zone of 3,000 housing units was built in the district of Rose des Vents. In 1971 the Citroën company opened its first factory in the Paris region north of the city. By 1985 Aulnay was completely urbanized. At that date the extension of the northern part and the establishment of industrial zones was complete. Many facilities were added in the districts and gave the city its present face.

===Heraldry===
==Politics==
===Administration===
Since the French canton reform, which came into effect in March 2015, Aulnay-sous-Bois forms one canton: Canton of Aulnay-sous-Bois.

The city is part of the &quot;Syndicat d&#x27;équipement et d&#x27;aménagement des Pays de France et de l&#x27;Aulnoye&quot; (Facilities and development association of Pays de France and Aulnoye) (SEAPFA).

The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1934.

===Administrative changes===
Until 1787, the parish of Aulnay was part of the province of Île-de-France, Prévôté, Généralité, Élection de Paris, Subdélégation de Saint-Denis. In 1787, during the formation of the department of Saint-Germain, the village of Aulnay was within the jurisdiction of Gonesse. In 1790 Aulnay was part of the department of Seine-et-Oise, of the canton and district of Gonesse.

In 1801 Aulnay became &quot;Aulnay-lès-Bondy&quot; and was part of the arrondissement of Pontoise. In 1903 Aulnay-lès-Bondy became &quot;Aulnay-sous-Bois&quot;. The first Canton of Aulnay-sous-Bois was founded in 1922 and included Blanc-Mesnil, Sevran, Villepinte, and Tremblay-les-Gonesse. From 1964 the city formed a Canton of Aulnay alone. Aulnay-sous-Bois, previously under the Department of Seine-et-Oise and the arrondissement of Pontoise, was attached to the new department of Seine-Saint-Denis, Arrondissement of Le Raincy, under the Act of 10 July 1964. This reform came into force on 1 January 1968. Between July 1967 and March 2015, Aulnay-sous-Bois was divided into two separate electoral districts and had two councillors.

===Mayors===

The 2008 French municipal elections in Aulnay-sous-Bois were annulled on 2 October 2008 by the Administrative Court of Cergy-Pontoise due to putting up posters in the night before the second round of municipal elections, which violated a ban on late campaigning. An appeal was brought before the Council of State and the municipal council and the elections in March 2008 remained in place until the court&#x27;s decision. The elections were finally validated after the decision of the court.

;Mayors from 1939


==Demographics==
According to INSEE (2004), the average household income is €15,000. Much of the upper-middle class lives in the south of the town. The canton of Aulnay-Sud has a very different character from the canton of Aulnay-Nord, owing to differences in education and wages. For example, the average income in the south of the town is around €20,000 - €25,000 (2004), much higher than the national average of €15,000 (2004). Furthermore, the north (Aulnay-Nord) has a high number of HLM (public housing). There is even a political divide, with Aulnay-Nord Canton sending a Socialist representative (Gerard Segura) to the Council-General for the Seine-Saint-Denis Department, but Aulnay-Sud a conservative (Jacques Chaussat).

===Immigration===
As of circa 1998 there were about 3,000 persons of East and Southeast Asian origin in Aulnay, while there were a total of 6,000 living in the area around Aulnay. Most of them were of Cambodian origin, including those with and without Cambodian citizenship. The commune also had an above-average number of persons of Laotian origin, including those with and without Laotian citizenship. Ethnicities included Khmer people, Lao people, and Overseas Chinese.

Many Asian families in Aulnay arrived in the period 1982 through 1990. As of circa 1998 most of the Asians in Aulnay resided in Les Trois Mille, a social housing estate, mainly due to a social agency wanting to increase ethnic diversity in a predominately North African area.

As of circa 1998 there were about 1,280 Asians in the Aulnay area active in the job market, and about 100 of the ethnic Chinese in the Aulnay area worked in Belleville and the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Even though Citroën factories are in proximity to Tres Trois Mille, relatively less than 88 of the Asians in Aulnay work in the factories.

===Political trends and results===
For the 2007 elections Aulnay-sous-Bois was one of 82 communes with more than 3,500 people to use voting machines. They have been used for all polling stations since the 2004 European elections. The municipal council elected in 2008 decided to return to vote by paper ballots.

===Twinning===
Aulnay-sous-Bois has twinning associations with:
*Rufisque (Senegal) since 2011.
* Northern Rotterdam (Netherlands).
* Al-Ram (Palestine) since 2010.
* Saïdia (Morocco) since 2012.

===Demography===

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Aulnaysiens&quot; or &quot;Aulnaysiennes&quot; in French.

The Centre for Strategic Analysis conducted a study on the city: the extract below tends to reflect a bad reputation, not necessarily deserved in all its aspects.

&quot;It would be wrong to present Aulnay simply as a disadvantaged commune. It is a city which is composed in part of professions, middle, and senior management. It is also a city with important economic resources - three economic centres are located there: a PSA Peugeot Citroën factory, a L&#x27;Oréal group centre, and a Garanor centre of economic activity...&quot;

In 2011 Aulnay-sous-Bois was the 55th most populated commune in France.

==Economy==
The city had good growth due to companies like L&#x27;Oréal and PSA Peugeot Citroën being located there. There are concerns, however, resulting from the departure of Xerox France and the fears that plague the Citroën plant.

===Statistics===
Aulnay-sous-Bois had 3,398 business enterprises in 2012 and 622 new enterprises were created in that year.

===Large companies===
*Aulnay-sous-Bois is home to the largest company in the department: Peugeot-Citroën Aulnay with over 5,000 employees and a production of about 400,000 vehicles per year.

*L&#x27;Oréal is located in the commune (a street and a pathway in the city bear the name of its founder Eugène Schueller), with a factory in the north and a research centre in the south.
*The Garonor logistics park has many freight companies.
*The O&#x27;Parinor regional mall (see shopping).

The city itself employs nearly 2,400 people and thus constitutes one of the largest employers in the town (see Administrative Staff).

===Automotive production===
In May 1973 it was reported that the first Citroën DS had emerged from the production line at Citroën&#x27;s new plant at Aulnay. The plant has subsequently produced various Citroën and Peugeot models and has on occasion hit the headlines as a focus of industrial strife. On 12 July 2012 PSA Peugeot Citroën announced that it will permanently close the Aulnay-sous-Bois plant due to overcapacity.

Aulnay is also the site of the subterranean Citroën repository of Citroën archives and 370 Citroën cars produced over the years. The repository, established in 2002, is not open to the public although members of Citroën enthusiasts&#x27; clubs and other important visitors are occasionally granted access to it.

===Shops===
The O&#x27;Parinor regional mall is located in the commune.

There is an Intermarché Hypermarket in Chanteloup.

There is at least one market every day from Tuesday through Sunday:
*At Galion in the heart of &quot;Rose des Vents&quot;: Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays
*At Vieux-Pays: Wednesdays and Saturdays
*On the Boulevard de Strasbourg: Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays

Two markets were held on the &quot;Place des Etangs&quot; and in the Ambourget district without success.

<text>The Frankfurter Zeitung (, ) was a German-language newspaper that appeared from 1856 to 1943. It emerged from a market letter that was published in Frankfurt. In Nazi Germany, it was considered the only mass publication not completely controlled by the Propagandaministerium under Joseph Goebbels.

==History==
In 1856, German writer and politician Leopold Sonnemann purchased a struggling market publication in Germany; the &quot;Frankfurter Geschäftsbericht&quot; (also known as &quot;Frankfurter Handelszeitung&quot;). Sonnemann changed its name to &quot;Neue Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; (later simply &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;) and assumed the duties of publisher, editor, and contributing writer. The new title incorporated political news and commentary, and by the time of the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; had become an important mouthpiece of the liberal bourgeois extra-parliamentary opposition. It advocated peace in Europe before 1914 and during World War I. 

In Constantinople, Paul Weitz, a strong critic of German militarism and the German state&#x27;s secret collaboration with the genocidal politics of the Young Turks, was the head of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;&#x27;s news bureau. His close associates included Max Rudolf Kaufmann, a Swiss-born journalist, who was arrested and deported in 1916 for his criticism of German militarism and letters by him to Berlin which reported the deplorable state of the Ottoman army in the Caucasus, and Dr. Friedrich Schrader, a journalist with (in 1914) more than two decades of experience in Constantinople who commanded all major languages of Southeastern Europe and the Middle East, and contributed much about modern Turkish culture and literature. 

During the period of the Weimar Republic, the paper was treated with hostility and derision by nationalist circles, due to its pronounced support of the Weimar Republic in 1919. At this time, it no longer stood in opposition to the government, and supported Gustav Stresemann&#x27;s policy of reconciliation during his time as Foreign Minister from 1923 to 1929. The &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; was one of the few democratic papers of the time. It was known in particular for its &quot;Feuilleton&quot; section, edited by Benno Reifenberg, in which works of most of the great minds of the Weimar Republic were published.

===Nazi era===
After the 1933 assumption of power by the Nazis, several Jewish contributors had to leave the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, including Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin. The paper was finally sold in June 1934 to the chemical corporation IG Farben. The company&#x27;s directors, particularly Carl Bosch, were well-disposed toward the paper because of its place in traditional German life, and believed it could be useful in promoting favorable publicity for the company.

During the Nazi&#x27;s early time in power, the paper was initially protected by Hitler and Joseph Goebbels primarily for its convenient public relations appeal abroad, and retained more editorial independence than the rest of the press in the Third Reich. However, within a few years IG Farben gave up on the newspaper; inexorably, it had become compromised by the increasing oversight of the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda and was quickly losing its journalistic reputation abroad. The company&#x27;s directors realized it no longer needed to influence domestic public opinion, &quot;since there was effectively no public opinion left in Germany&quot;. 

The paper was quietly sold and subsumed by a subsidiary of the Nazi publishing organ, &quot;Eher Verlag&quot;, in 1938. In late 1941, the paper was faced with scandal when Richard Sorge, the longtime Tokyo correspondent of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; and a Nazi party member, was arrested by the Japanese police under charges of espionage for the Soviet Union. Sorge was revealed to be the top Soviet spy in Japan, his allegiance to Nazism just a mere disguise for his real beliefs, and was executed in 1944. Faced with declining readership throughout the Second World War, it was closed down entirely in August 1943.

===Postwar era===
The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; does not consider itself a successor organisation to the original &quot;Zeitung&quot;, even though many former journalists of the earlier paper helped launch it in 1949.

<text>The Adoration of the Magi or Adoration of the Kings or Visitation of the Wise Men is the name traditionally given to the subject in the Nativity of Jesus in art in which the three Magi, represented as kings, especially in the West, having found Jesus by following a star, lay before him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and worship him. It is related in the Bible by Matthew 2:11: &quot;On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another path&quot;.

Christian iconography considerably expanded the bare account of the Biblical Magi described in the Gospel of Matthew (2:1–22). By the later Middle Ages this drew from non-canonical sources like the Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine. Artists used the expanded Christian iconography to reinforce the idea that Jesus was recognized, from his earliest infancy, as king of the earth. The adoration scene was often used to represent the Nativity, one of the most indispensable episodes in cycles of the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; as well as the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;.

Stories throughout the Middle Ages started circulating, which speculated who exactly were the three kings who were famous for visiting the Christ child. Many people assumed that they came from somewhere in the east. Eventually it was decided that the three kings would represent the three main continents at the time; Europe, Asia, and Africa. The three names that prevailed over the centuries for the three kings were Gaspar (or Caspar), Melchior, and Balthasar. The prominence of this story, as well as the three kings or magi, is due to the great theological significance that the Biblical story holds, their exotic clothes and looks, as well as their great and expensive gifts.

In the church calendar, the event is commemorated in Western Christianity as the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6). The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates the Adoration of the Magi on the Feast of the Nativity (December 25). The term is anglicized from the Vulgate Latin section title for this passage: A Magis adoratur.

==History of the depiction==

In the earliest depictions, the Magi are shown wearing Persian dress of trousers and Phrygian caps, usually in profile, advancing in step with their gifts held out before them. These images adapt Late Antique poses for barbarians submitting to an Emperor, and presenting golden wreaths, and indeed relate to images of tribute-bearers from various Mediterranean and ancient Near Eastern cultures going back many centuries. The earliest are from catacomb paintings and sarcophagus reliefs of the 4th century. Crowns are first seen in the 10th century, mostly in the West, where their dress had by that time lost any Oriental flavour in most cases.
The standard Byzantine depiction of the Nativity included the journey or arrival of the mounted Magi in the background, but not them presenting their gifts, until the post-Byzantine period, when the western depiction was often adapted to an icon style. Later Byzantine images often show small pill-box like hats, whose significance is disputed.

The Magi are usually shown as the same age until about this period, but then the idea of depicting the three ages of man is introduced: a particularly beautiful example is seen on the façade of the cathedral of Orvieto. Occasionally from the 12th century, and very often in Northern Europe from the 15th, the Magi are also made to represent the three known parts of the world: Balthasar is very commonly cast as a young African or Moor, and old Caspar is given Oriental features or, more often, dress. Melchior represents Europe and middle age. Early Renaissance paintings of this theme, such as by Fra Angelico and Fra Lippi, emphasize the pomp and pageantry of the scene.

From the 14th century onward, large retinues are often shown, the gifts are contained in spectacular pieces of goldsmith work, and the Magi&#x27;s clothes are given increasing attention. By the 15th century, the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; is often a bravura piece in which the artist can display their handling of complex, crowded scenes involving horses and camels, but also their rendering of varied textures: the silk, fur, jewels and gold of the Kings set against the wood of the stable, the straw of Jesus&#x27;s manger and the rough clothing of Joseph and the shepherds.

The subject was especially popular with the artists of Antwerp Mannerism from about 1500 to 1530. These mostly anonymous artists lived in the Golden Age of Antwerp, as it took over from Bruges as the leading business city of the Low Countries, capturing a huge proportion of the explosion in international trade that followed the development by the Portuguese of the sea route from Asia. The Magis were regarded as the patron saints of travelling merchants, and so international trade in general, and large numbers of their patrons no doubt came from the various international business communities from different countries resident in Antwerp. In the Greek world, Cretan painter Michael Damaskinos revitalized the Greek Italian Byzantine style by mixing it with Venetian painting in his rendition of the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; around 1590. The island of Crete was held by the Venetian Empire and the painting style was known as the Cretan School 



The scene often includes a fair diversity of animals as well: the ox and ass from the Nativity scene are usually there, but also the horses, camels, dogs, and falcons of the kings and their retinue, and sometimes other animals, such as birds in the rafters of the stable. From the 15th century onwards, the Adoration of the Magi is quite often conflated with the Adoration of the Shepherds from the account in the Gospel of Luke (2:8–20), an opportunity to bring in yet more human and animal diversity; in some compositions (triptychs for example), the two scenes are contrasted or set as pendants to the central scene, usually a Nativity.

The &quot;adoration&quot; of the Magi at the crib is the usual subject, but their arrival, called the &quot;Procession of the Magi&quot;, is often shown in the distant background of a Nativity scene (usual in Byzantine icons), or as a separate subject, for example in the Magi Chapel frescos by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, Florence. Other subjects include the Journey of the Magi, where they and perhaps their retinue are the only figures, usually shown following the Star of Bethlehem, and there are relatively uncommon scenes of their meeting with Herod and the &quot;Dream of the Magi&quot;.

The usefulness of the subject to the Church and the technical challenges involved in representing it have made the Adoration of the Magi a favorite subject of Christian art: chiefly painting, but also sculpture and even music (as in Gian-Carlo Menotti&#x27;s opera &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;). The subject matter is also found in stained glass. The first figural stained glass window made in the United States is the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; window located at Christ Church, Pelham, New York and designed in 1843 by the founder and first rector&#x27;s son, William Jay Bolton.

<text>Kerrera ( ; or &quot;Cearrara&quot;) is an island in the Scottish Inner Hebrides, close to the town of Oban. In 2016 it had a population of 45, divided into two communities in the north and south of the island.

== Geography ==
The island is around long and around wide, and is separated from the mainland by the Sound of Kerrera, about wide. The highest point on Kerrera is Carn Breugach at . The island is linked to the mainland by two ferry services. In the middle of the island, the Caledonian MacBrayne passenger ferry MV &quot;Carvoria&quot; operates from the Gallanach Road (about southwest of Oban). From the landing place, tracks lead to the scattered settlements in the centre and south of the island. The south end circular walking loop takes around 3 hours to walk. The northern tip of the island can be accessed by a separate marina ferry service operating from North Pier in the centre of Oban. The service runs to Oban Marina near Ardentrive Farm, which is now linked by a road to the rest of the island.

== History ==
The island is known for the ruined Gylen Castle, a small tower house built in 1582. It was also the place where Alexander II of Scotland died in 1249. The artist J. M. W. Turner visited Kerrera in 1831 and made 25 sketches of the castle which are in the Tate Gallery, London.

== Community ==
Most of the island is owned by the McDougalls of Dunollie, who are descended from the Norse-Gael Somerled. The tidal island at the north-east tip of Kerrera, Rubh a&#x27; Chruidh, was sold for £426,000 in 2010 to Lanarkshire businessman David Hamilton.

In the 2011 census, Kerrera had a population of 34. However in 2019, residents said that the population had doubled to 68 people, including 18 children. There are no public buildings or facilities on the island (apart from two compost loos provided by the community). In July 2019, the Isle of Kerrera Development Trust community organisation purchased the old primary school building, close to the public ferry slip near the centre of the island; the building had been empty and deteriorating since closing in 1997. The community plans to restore the building into a multi-functional centre.

The main industries on the island are farming (sheep and Highland cattle) and tourism. There was an exotic bird sanctuary, closed . There is a tea room/café (Kerrera Tea Garden &amp; Bunkhouse) at the south end near Gylen Castle but no shop and no pub. The castle itself was restored to some extent in 2006 and is open to the public.

In August 2021 work began to connect the small communities in the north and south of the island by road. A forestry track was initially constructed, and in October 2022 a metalled single track road was opened.

== Geology ==
The oldest bedrock of Kerrera is black slate ascribed to the Easdale Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Overlying this across half of the island are conglomeratic sandstones and basalt and augite-andesite lavas of early Devonian age, the former being the local representative of the Old Red Sandstone and the latter constituting part of the Lorne Plateau Lavas. Ripple marks and sun cracks are preserved in shale strata on the south coast, belying the subaerial environment in which deposition of these sediments took place. There are thin limestones within both the Easdale Slate Formation and the younger sandstones. All of these strata are cut by NW-SE aligned igneous dykes forming part of the North Britain Palaeogene Dyke Suite associated with early Palaeogene volcanism. A number of geological faults cut across Kerrera, the majority are aligned NE-SW.
Modern beach deposits and raised marine deposits of Holocene age are found around the island particularly on the north coast and along the Sound of Kerrera.

<doc id="473671" wikidata="Q313237" url="?curid=473671" title="Amaziah of Judah">
<text>Amaziah of Judah (pronounced , ; ; ), was the ninth king of Judah and the son and successor of Joash. His mother was Jehoaddan () and his son was Uzziah (). He took the throne at the age of 25, after the assassination of his father, and reigned for 29 years ( ), 24 years of which were with the co-regency of his son. The second Book of Kings and the second Book of Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible consider him a righteous king, but with some hesitation. He is praised for killing the assassins of his father &quot;only&quot; and sparing their children, as dictated by the Mosaic Law.

Edwin R. Thiele dates Amaziah&#x27;s reign from 797/796 to 768/767 BCE. Thiele&#x27;s chronology has his son Uzziah becoming co-regent with him in the fifth year of his reign, in 792/791 BCE, when Uzziah was 16 years old.

==Reign==

As soon as his kingdom was established, Amaziah executed the murderers of his father, but he permitted their children to live in obedience to the Mosaic law:
:Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; a person shall be put to death for his own sin.

According to Chronicles, Amaziah was the first to employ a mercenary army of 100,000 soldiers from Efraim (a force significantly larger than the one Alexander used for his conquest of Asia-minor) with 100 talents, as a supplement to his 300.000 Judean soldiers, in an attempt to reconquer Edom, which had rebelled during the reign of Jehoram, his great-grandfather. He was commanded by an unnamed prophet to send back the mercenaries, with whom he acquiesced (, 13), much to the annoyance of the mercenaries. His obedience to this command was followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites ().

Due to the Israelite mercenaries&#x27; anger at being excluded from the battle, they attacked and looted multiple towns in Judah. Amaziah resembled his father, at the beginning of his reign he was God fearing; yet Despite the fact that with the aid of the L-D, Amaziah had won a brilliant victory over the Edomites, he knew no better way of manifesting his gratitude than to establish in Jerusalem the cult of the idol worshipped by his conquered foes. An unnamed prophet rebuked him for this, and the king responded by threatening him that if he continued to admonish him, he would have him executed. To compass his chastisement, God inspired Amaziah with the idea of provoking a war with Joash, the ruler of the northern kingdom. His victory over Edom inflated his pride, and he challenged to a combat Jehoash, grandson of Jehu, king of Israel. Amaziah demanded that Joash should either recognize the suzerainty of the southern realm voluntary, or let the fate of battle decide the question. At first Jehoash sought to turn Amaziah aside from his purpose by a parable reminding him of the fate of Shechem, which the sons of Jacob had visited upon him for having done violence to their sister Dinah. Amaziah refused to be warned Jehoash&#x27;s disdain and scorn for Amaziah are embodied in the stinging parable of the thistle and the cedar (). In his resentment, Amaziah rushed into a disastrous battle at Beth-shemesh, and a humiliating defeat overtook his army and the land. The king was captured, 400 cubits of the wall of Jerusalem was broken down, the city, Temple, and palace were looted, and hostages were carried to Samaria.

His defeat was followed by a conspiracy which took his life. He, like his father, was the victim of assassins, apparently bent upon killing the one who had brought upon such dire disasters upon the land. Amaziah was killed by his own subjects at Lachish, to which he had fled, and his body was brought to Jerusalem, where it was buried in the royal sepulcher (; ). While the narrative in 2 Kings records the conspiracy &quot;in &quot;fact&quot; only&quot;, the Chronicler &quot;characteristically connects the conspiracy with Amaziah’s apostasy&quot;, which took place &quot;after the time that&quot; (and by implication, &quot;because&quot;) &quot;Amaziah turned away from following the Lord&quot;.

The rabbis of the Talmud declared, based upon a rabbinic tradition, that Prophet Amoz was the brother of Amaziah (אמציה), the king of Judah at that time (and, as a result, that Prophet Isaiah himself was a member of the royal family).

==Biblical evaluation==
According to the Books of Kings, Amaziah &quot;did what was right in the sight of the Lord&quot;, but did not meet the standard of righteousness set by King David; in particular, because he did not remove the local shrines on the &quot;high places&quot; and centralise worship in Jerusalem. The writer of the Books of Chronicles also considers that during the earlier part of his reign, &quot;he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a loyal heart&quot;.

Biblical scholar H. P. Mathys notes that , verses which deals with Amaziah&#x27;s discharge of the mercenary army, are &quot;often regarded as having stemmed from an independent source available to the Chronicler, since they do not conform with his theology.

==Chronological notes==
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Amaziah, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of his accession to some time between Nisan 1 of 796 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same BCE year. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 797/796 BC, or more simply 797 BCE. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 and Tishri 1 of 767 BCE, i.e. in 768/767 by Judean reckoning, or more simply 768 BCE.

<text>A terrain park or snow park is an outdoor recreation area containing terrain that allows skiers, snowboarders and snowbikers to perform tricks. Terrain parks have their roots in skateparks and many of the features are common to both.

From their inception to as recently as the 1980s, ski areas generally banned jumping and any kind of aerial maneuvers, usually under penalty of revoking the offender&#x27;s lift ticket. By the 1990s, most areas provided snow features specifically catering to aerial snowsports. One of the first in-bounds terrain parks was the snowboard park built in 1990 at Vail&#x27;s (Colorado) resort. The park was copied soon in other resorts. Today most resorts have terrain parks, with many having multiple parks of various difficulty. Some resorts are almost exclusively terrain parks such as Echo Mountain Park in Evergreen, Colorado and Snow Park in Wānaka, New Zealand. In Colorado there has been a recent trend for defunct resorts such as Squaw Pass (now Echo Mountain Park) to be reopened, catering to terrain park users.

==History==
The first known terrain park (then called a ‘snowboard park’) was built at Bear Valley Ski Area (California) in the 1989–90 season. It was the brainchild of Bear Valley&#x27;s Marketing Director Sean McMahon and California snowboarder and contest organizer Mike McDaniel.

McMahon&#x27;s idea was to create an area of the mountain specifically for snowboarders—modeled after the skateparks of the 1970s, featuring jumps, jibs, and a halfpipe—that would bring new customers to the small, family operated ski area in the Central Sierra. He enlisted the help of McDaniel, who had experience building snowboard-specific terrain features such as halfpipes and jumps, through his work organizing early snowboard events. McDaniel in turn, brought in snowboard pioneers Mike Chantry and Keith Kimmel to consult on the design and construction of the park, to be located on the front side of Bear Valley&#x27;s upper mountain.

A surface lift was installed to bring snowboarders from the bottom of the area back to the top, without having to take a chair lift to the top of the mountain. Kim Krause, who had run lifts in other areas of the resort, was brought on as the park&#x27;s first lift operator.

It became apparent that the park would need ongoing construction, grooming, and maintenance, and McDaniel was hired by Bear Valley in the fall of 1989 to be Snowboard Park Manager. The new mountain attraction was dubbed the “Polar Park.” Opening day in late November 1989 featured a demonstration by professional snowboarders Damian Sanders, Terry Kidwell, Noah Salasnek, Mike and Tina Basich and others. The event was covered by Thrasher Magazine, International Snowboard Magazine and local media.

==Difficulty==
Terrain parks (in the United States and Canada) have designations with respect to safety similar to standard alpine slopes. They differ in their designation and degrees of difficulty. They are identified with orange ovals to differentiate them from standard slopes, and are further distinguished by large, medium, or small features. While features vary between resorts, commonly small features are short jumps and rails that are at the slope surface, Medium features are high jumps along with jibs requiring small jumps to mount. Large features include jumps along with complex jibs and large vertical pipes.

&quot;Progression parks&quot; are easier terrain parks, meant for those just starting to ride these features.

==Jibs==

Jibs are any type of fixture which can be ridden with the board/skis either parallel or perpendicular to the snow surface, ridden while spinning around on, or ridden and jumped or tricked from. Many jib features resemble outdoor items used when snowboarding in urban areas, such as stair handrails, benches, tables, etc. In the park these feature consist of:

;Rail: A metal feature, either rounded or with a flat surface, which a skier or snowboarder can slide across (called &quot;jibbing&quot;). Many people confuse rails with wider surfaces with boxes, however these are not, and are just rails with a little UHMWPE on top.
;Box: Similar to a rail, but wider with an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) surface. May or may not have metal edges. &quot;Compare Funbox, for skateboarding.&quot;
;Table Top: Similar to a box, but much wider. Commonly used by beginners who want to become comfortable with box type surfaces before moving on to real boxes. Table Tops are very wide and therefore allow a skier or snowboarder to slide across the surface and is difficult to fall on.
;Trees: used as natural surfaces and can be found either on or off the trails.
Rails and boxes have many different shapes and sizes: straight, sloped, curved (often called a &quot;Rainbow&quot;), or kinked. Rails, especially rainbow, will also be seen curving over obstacles or vehicles.
;Park Bench and Picnic Table: A funbox type feature that resembles a park bench or picnic table. The edges are made of metal rails and the surfaces of UHMWPE. These features provide multiple sliding surfaces.
;Mail Box: A large diameter metal pipe of varying lengths with a cross-section resembling a mail box.
;Wall ride: A vertical, or near-vertical, wall-like surface. Most wall rides have another similar surface at the top that is angled down towards the wall, but more perpendicular to the ground (like a sideways funbox attached to the top of the wall ride)
;Barrels: A more recent addition to terrain parks, barrels are features usually shaped like garbage cans or vertical cylinders with a small jump leading up to it. This feature is jibbed by going off the jump and tapping it in various ways with your skis or snowboard. Variations include spinning to and from the barrel, tapping with different parts of the skis or stalling on top of the barrel.
;Rainbow: A box or rail that has a hump like a &quot;rainbow.&quot;
;Kink: 
A box or rail that has one or more &quot;kinks&quot;. A kink is a sudden change in angle of a sliding surface. An example of a kinked feature is a F-D-F (flat-down-flat).
;Pole Jam: 
A rail that is stuck into a jump at an upward angle
;Tap Feature:
A feature that comes in many shapes and sizes and is meant to be tapped with either the tail or tip end of skis or snowboards.

==Jumps==
Jumps in terrain parks can range from five feet to 100 feet &amp; above, and will vary park to park and resort to resort. In contrast to jibs, typically being manufactured off-site of steel and plastic, jumps are most commonly constructed entirely of snow or snow with a base of dirt. Tricks such as grabs, twists, spins and flips are often performed while in the air from a jump. Types of jumps in a park may consist of:

;Tabletop: A jump that looks somewhat like a table or trapezoid in which one takes off from an incline (the lip), clear a flat part (the table), and lands on a downslope (the landing).
;Step-down: A jump in which the landing is lower than the takeoff.
;Step-up: A jump in which the landing is higher than the takeoff.
;Gap: A jump that has a gap in between the take off and landing, instead of a table.
;Hip: A jump with one landing, which is perpendicular to the take off.
;Spine: A jump with two landings, which are perpendicular to the take off. Similar to a hip, but with a landing on both sides.
;Channel gap: Looks like a wide jump cut at the middle, so it becomes a gap between the two jumps.

==Vertical==

* Half-pipe: a downhill trough with vertical lips on each side, resembling half of a cylinder.
* Quarter-pipe: a vertical lip with the intention that the user launch straight into the air, then land on the same lip.

==Terrain park only areas==
Terrain park only areas which are similar to regular resorts are becoming more common and are increasing in popularity. These areas typically have jumps and features on all trails and are generally smaller than most resorts. While their size may be less than that of larger resorts these areas are more appealing to terrain park riders as they are typically cheaper, have more extreme or uncommon features, and have music played over loud speakers throughout the area. These areas are generally rider owned and operated. Carinthia Parks at Mount Snow, Vermont is the only all terrain park mountain face in New England with two lifts accessing nine different parks.

<doc id="473686" wikidata="Q7759376" url="?curid=473686" title="The Ramona Pageant">
<text>The Ramona Outdoor Play, formerly known as (and still commonly called) The Ramona Pageant, is an outdoor drama staged annually in Hemet, California, since 1923. 
It is loosely based on the 1884 novel &quot;Ramona&quot; by Helen Hunt Jackson.

==History and origination==
The original script was written by Garnet Holme in 1923. Holme was also the original director and the person who chose the plot of land where the play is still currently set, called the Ramona Bowl. The Ramona Bowl (or The Bowl) is located in the San Jacinto Mountains, in a valley in Hemet. There is a hillside where the stage is set, as well as an audience area. In 1988, major renovations took place, in which the valley was lifted, allowing the audience to move closer to the hillside. Although at least eight other stage plays have been adapted from the novel, &quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot; is the only surviving version. Moreover, Holme&#x27;s adaptation is the most successful and the most circulated version of the play. The play is held over three consecutive weekends in April and May in the Ramona Bowl, a natural amphitheater in the foothills above Hemet in Riverside County. In 2015, a brand new, updated script was written by international award-winning film director and screenwriter Stephen Savage, featuring much more action and historic content, while remaining far from the author’s original novel. Under the direction of Dennis Anderson, the new version enters its 7th season in 2023.

&quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot; used to be the longest running outdoor play in the United States, until 2020 when COVID ended this incredible streak. It ran uninterrupted except in 1933, caused by Great Depression; in 1942, when World War II occurred and in 2020 caused by COVID-19 pandemic. In 1993 it was declared California&#x27;s official State Outdoor Play.

==Overview==
The play can be considered a &quot;Romeo and Juliet that is set in the Wild Wild West&quot;, since it resembles the story of two star-crossed lovers challenging their rivaling families in order to be together, despite the ongoing situation of white settlers taking over the native land. Ramona is an orphaned half-Native American and half-Scottish, who was adopted by Senora Moreno, a Mexican-American woman. Unfortunately, Ramona was neglected by her adopter, since she was of mixed race. When Ramona meets Alessandro, she falls in love with him. Alessandro is the son of Pablo Assis, the chief of the Temecula Indian tribe. When Senora Moreno finds out about Ramona and Alessandro, she is infuriated because she does not approve the marriage between a half-Native American and a full-Native American. When Ramona finds out that Senora Moreno never actually treated her with love and respect as a child, she runs away with Alessandro. During their elopement, they are constantly going through hardships such as having their properties stolen by immigrants and being pushed further into isolation. Soon, they conceive a child. However, Alessandro borrows a horse (without permission) when their child falls ill and is shot and killed while trying to return the horse. After Alessandro&#x27;s death, Ramona returns to Senora Moreno&#x27;s home and marries her son. They both have multiple children, along with Ramona&#x27;s and Alessandro&#x27;s first child. 

==Performers==
The production features a cast of approximately 375 members, mainly local volunteers or residents in the community. Holme says that casting local members maintained the authenticity of the roles in the play. Animals such as horses and mules are also featured in the play, as well as early California musicians, The Arias Troubadours. The Arias Troubadours have been providing the beautiful and authentic musical sound track since 1924. The Arias Troubadours were founded by Jose Arias and Antonio Corral whose descendants Carlos Corral (son), Henry Arias (grandson), Joseph Arias (grandson), John Murphy (great-grandson) and Violet Murphy (great-great-granddaughter) carry on the family legacy of cultural and traditional music. The Spanish dancer, Desiree Corral, is the granddaughter of Arias Troubadour founding member Antonio Corral. The lead roles are Ramona and Alessandro, her Native American lover. In 2023, &quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot; celebrated its 100th year as American&#x27;s longest running outdoor play.

==Influence==

The play is strongly supported by local residents of Hemet, some spanning generations of entire families, who have had a role in the play, such as managing and leading a group of children acting as Native American kids who play on the hilltop, washing and mending the costumes that the casts wear, and applying makeup to cast members. Although the play was shortened from three hours to two and a half hours, the play&#x27;s theme of tolerance and message of acceptance haven&#x27;t been changed. The narrative has remained the same, maintained through the tradition of the play. Alongside &quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot;, there were also five movie adaptations, one song adaptation, and tourist attractions. The play also launched the successful careers of Anne Archer and Raquel Welch. Moreover, it gave an opportunity of exposure in which it altered the public opinions of Native American culture and the history of how they were almost decimated as the country moved forward, advancing in technology and urbanization. The romanticizing of 1850s Southern California also signified the historical heritage and the lifestyle of the indigenous people before industrialization and modernization.

==California Historical Landmarks==
A marker at the site reads:
*&quot; Within this valley was laid part of the scene, and here resided a number of the characters portrayed in Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;Ramona&quot;, which depicted life and presented the status of the Indians of many great ranchos in early California beginning around the 1850s. This story, dramatized by the late Garnet Holme, was first presented on this site Apr. 13 1923, becoming annual event.&quot; Erected 1950 by California Centennials Commission in cooperation with Ramona Pageant Association, Inc. (Marker Number 1009.)

Another nearby marker reads:
*&quot;Pochea was one of cluster of Indian villages forming the very large settlement of Pahsitna which extended along the ridge east and west of Ramona Bowl. Pahsitnah was thriving when the Spanish first passed by in 1774. A tragic story tells of the natives contracting smallpox from Europeans; a terrible epidemic spreading, and some survivors fleeing to the area of the present Soboba Reservation.&quot; Erected 1983 by State Department of Parks and Recreation, San Jacinto Valley Museum, Hemet Area Museum Assoc., Ramona Pageant Assoc.

<text>Robert Pinsky (born October 20, 1940) is an American poet, essayist, literary critic, and translator. He was the first United States Poet Laureate to serve three terms. Recognized worldwide, Pinsky&#x27;s work has earned numerous accolades. Pinsky is a professor of English and creative writing in the graduate writing program at Boston University. In 2015 the university named him a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor, the highest honor bestowed on senior faculty members who are actively involved in teaching, research, scholarship, and university civic life.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Pinsky was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, to Jewish parents, Sylvia (née Eisenberg) and Milford Simon Pinsky, an optician. He attended Long Branch High School. He received a B.A. from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and earned both an M.A. and PhD from Stanford University, where he was a Stegner Fellow in creative writing. He was a student of Francis Fergusson and Paul Fussell at Rutgers and Yvor Winters at Stanford.

=== Personal life ===
Pinsky married Ellen Jane Bailey, a clinical psychologist, in 1961. They have three children. Pinsky taught at Wellesley College and at the University of California at Berkeley, and since 1989 has lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and teaches in the graduate writing program at Boston University.

=== Career ===
Early on, Pinsky was inspired by the flow and tension of jazz and the excitement that it made him feel. As a former saxophonist, he has said that being a musician was a profoundly influential experience that he has tried to reproduce in his poetry. The musicality of poetry was and is extremely important to his work. Additionally, Pinsky revealed in a 1999 interview with &quot;Bomb Magazine&quot; that he enjoys jazz for its &quot;physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase.&quot;

Pinsky has acknowledged that his poetry would change somewhat depending on the particular subjectivity of each reader. Embracing the idea that people&#x27;s individuality would fill out the poem, he has said, &quot;The poetry I love is vocal, composed with the poet&#x27;s voice and I believe its proper culmination is to be read with a reader&#x27;s imagined or actual voice. The human voice in that sense is not electronically reproduced or amplified; it&#x27;s the actual living breath inside a body—not necessarily an expert&#x27;s body or the artist&#x27;s body. Whoever reads the poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem.&quot; Pinsky observes &#x27;the kind of poetry I write emphasizes the physical qualities of the words&#x27; for poetry to Pinsky, is a vocal art, not necessarily performative, but reading to one self or recalling some lines by memory. Pinsky comments &#x27;all language is necessarily abstract&#x27; . No aspect of a poem, he observes, is more singular, more unique, than its rhythm, for there are no rules.

He received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship in 1974, and in 1997 he was named the United States Poet Laureate and Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress; he was the first poet to be named to three terms. As Poet Laureate, Pinsky founded the Favorite Poem Project, in which thousands of Americans of varying backgrounds, all ages, and from every state share their favorite poems. Pinsky believed that, contrary to stereotype, poetry has a strong presence in the American culture. The project sought to document that presence, giving voice to the American audience for poetry.

The Shakespeare Theatre of Washington, D.C. commissioned Pinsky to write a free adaptation of Friederich Schiller&#x27;s drama &quot;Wallenstein&quot;. The Shakespeare Theatre presented the play, starring Stephen Pickering in the title role, directed by Michael Kahn, in 2013. Premiering on April 17 of that year, the play had a sold-out run, in repertory with &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. Pinsky also wrote the libretto for &quot;Death and the Powers&quot;, an opera by composer Tod Machover. The opera received its world premiere in Monte Carlo in September 2010 and its U.S. premiere at Boston&#x27;s Cutler Majestic Theater in March 2011. Pinsky is also the author of the interactive fiction game &quot;Mindwheel&quot; (1984) developed by Synapse Software and released by Broderbund.

Pinsky guest-starred in an episode of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; TV show, &quot;Little Girl in the Big Ten&quot; (2002), and appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in April, 2007, as the judge of a &quot;Meta-Free-Phor-All&quot; between Stephen Colbert and Sean Penn.

Since 2000, Farrar, Straus and Giroux have published four books of his poetry &quot;Jersey Rain&quot; (2000), &quot;Gulf Music&quot; (2007) &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (2011) and &quot;At the Foundling Hospital&quot; (2016).

In 2012, Circumstantial Productions released the CD, &quot;PoemJazz&quot; by Robert Pinsky and Laurence Hobgood. In 2015, &quot;House Hour: PoemJazz II&quot; was released.

Pinsky served as editor of the 25th anniversary volume of &quot;The Best of American Poetry&quot; anthologies called &quot;The Best of the Best of American Poetry&quot; (2013), and is the former poetry editor of &quot;Slate&quot;. He edited &quot;Singing School&quot; (2014), &quot;The Mind Has Cliffs of Fall: Poems at the Extremes of Feeling&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Book of Poetry for Hard Times&quot; (2021).

In 2023, W.W. Norton published Pinsky&#x27;s memoir &quot;Jersey Breaks: Becoming an American Poet&quot;.

<doc id="473707" wikidata="Q2342159" url="?curid=473707" title="Rich Dad Poor Dad">
<text>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one&#x27;s financial intelligence (financial IQ).

&quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; is written in the style of a set of parables presented as autobiographical. The titular &quot;rich dad&quot; is his best friend&#x27;s father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the &quot;poor dad&quot; is claimed to be Kiyosaki&#x27;s own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security.

Kiyosaki&#x27;s prior business ventures had been modest, but he promoted &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; from self-publication to best-seller status and made it the cornerstone of a media and educational franchise. For many years he avoided questions about the identity of the &quot;rich dad,&quot; raising suspicions that no such person had existed. Following the death of Hawaiian hotel developer Richard Kimi, he was identified as Kiyosaki&#x27;s mentor. The contents of this book has been proven largely inaccurate and fictional as throughout his many books, multiple claims about his life has been spoken and also most claims about his &quot;poor dad&quot; was false. The book claims Robert claimed he was into real estate and retired at the age of 47 due to the advice he received from his &quot;rich dad&quot; which has been inaccurate as In his previous book, he said he retired at the age of 43 after teaching finance in Money and you. Also he stated that he was millionaire from 1985 onwards when In reality he was homeless back then, like this the contents of this book is largely false and fictional.

==Summary==
The story begins with the author as a young boy, observing the contrasting financial mindsets and behaviors of his own father, the &quot;poor dad,&quot; and a friend&#x27;s father, the &quot;rich dad.&quot; The poor dad held a high position in education and emphasized the importance of academic success, job security, and living within one&#x27;s means. The rich dad, a successful entrepreneur, believed in building assets, investing wisely, and acquiring financial knowledge. It describes how the rich dad teaches the author and his friend finance through practical lessons.

Throughout the book, Kiyosaki shares anecdotes and conversations that he had with the rich dad, who guided him on various aspects of money, wealth creation, and financial independence. He learns valuable lessons about the difference between assets and liabilities, the power of financial education, and the importance of taking calculated risks. Kiyosaki emphasizes the significance of acquiring assets that generate income, such as real estate and businesses, as opposed to liabilities that drain money, such as excessive consumer debt and unnecessary expenses. He introduces concepts like the cash flow quadrant, which categorizes individuals as employees, self-employed, business owners, or investors, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each quadrant.

The book also delves into the mindset and beliefs around money, discussing the importance of developing a positive relationship with wealth and overcoming limiting beliefs. Kiyosaki stresses the need for financial literacy and encourages readers to take control of their financial destinies by seeking out opportunities, learning from mistakes, and continuously educating themselves about money.

== Reception ==
=== Commercial ===
&quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; has sold over 32 million copies. The book has been translated to over 51 languages across 109 countries, and has been on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years. It launched a series of books and related products; and received positive reviews from some critics.

=== Critical ===
Actor Will Smith said he taught his son about financial independence by reading the book. PBS Public Television station KOCE aired a 55-minute presentation of Kiyosaki titled &quot;A Guide to Wealth&quot; in 2006, which essentially summarises his &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; book. PBS also honored him with an excellence in education award in 2005. Donald Trump did a literary collaboration with Kiyosaki in 2006 called &quot;Why We Want You to Be Rich: Two Men, One Message&quot;, and a second book called &quot;Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich — And Why Most Don&#x27;t&quot; in 2011.

American fashion entrepreneur and investor Daymond John has called the book one of his favorites.

A competing financial self-help writer, John T. Reed, says, &quot;&quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; contains a large amount wrong advice, much bad advice, and virtually no good advice.&quot; He also states, &quot;&quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is one of the dumbest financial advice books I have ever read. It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely accounts of events that supposedly occurred.&quot;

&quot;Slate&quot; reviewer Rob Walker called the book full of nonsense, and said that Kiyosaki&#x27;s claims were often vague, the narrative &quot;fablelike&quot;, and that much of the book was &quot;self-help boilerplate&quot;, noting the predictable common features of such books were present in &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;. He also criticizes Kiyosaki&#x27;s conclusions about Americans, American culture, and Kiyosaki&#x27;s methods.

== Publishing success ==
The book was self-published in 1997 before being picked up commercially to become a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. It has since sold over 32 million copies and become a household name. In his audio-book &quot;Choose to be Rich&quot;, Kiyosaki said that every publisher turned him down, and Barnes &amp; Noble refused to stock the book initially. He places his focus upon talk shows and radio show appearances, of which &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; had the biggest influence on book sales. 

In April 2017 a 20th Anniversary edition was published and in a preface to this 20th Anniversary edition Kiyosaki asserts that an estimated 40 million copies of the book had been sold globally.

<text>Caron Louisa Keating (5 October 1962 – 13 April 2004) was a British television presenter.

==Early life and education==
Keating was born on 5 October 1962 in Fulham, south-west London, to an English father with Irish roots and a Northern Irish mother. When she was three months old her family relocated to Northern Ireland where she was raised. Her parents were the television presenter Gloria Hunniford and the BBC producer Donald Keating (d. 1997). Keating attended Harmony Hill Primary School, Lisburn and Methodist College, Belfast, where she gained 8 &#x27;O&#x27; levels and 3 &#x27;A&#x27; levels. She was accepted to study at the University of Bristol where she graduated three years later aged 21 with a BA Honours Degree in English and Drama.

==Broadcasting career==
Keating&#x27;s television career began in Northern Ireland where she presented &quot;The Video Picture Show&quot;, &quot;Channel One&quot; and the music programme &quot;Greenrock&quot;, but her big break came when she was selected to join the team of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 13 November 1986.

Keating appeared on the programme with Peter Duncan, Janet Ellis, Mark Curry, Yvette Fielding, and John Leslie. Her &quot;Blue Peter&quot; career included a trip to Moscow in 1987 during the perestroika period, swimming with sharks, abseiling down skyscrapers and standing strapped to the top of a light aircraft whilst it performed aerial acrobatics. She also interviewed serving prime minister Margaret Thatcher on the programme in 1988.

After four years, Keating left &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 22 January 1990. Keating joined BBC Radio 5 where amongst other programmes she co-hosted an early 90s afternoon show with film critic Mark Kermode titled &quot;A Game of Two Halves&quot;. In his autobiography, Kermode described Keating as &quot;The very dictionary definition of Lovely&quot;. She presented several other TV programmes including &quot;This Morning&quot;, before breast cancer was diagnosed in 1997. Keating was the face of Sainsbury&#x27;s Reward Card from 1996 to 1997, before Edita Brychta took over towards the end of 1997, and also appeared in a TV commercial for So Good soya drink in 1999. In 1999 she co-presented the consumer affairs programme &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; on ITV with Judy Finnigan and Jenni Falconer.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Keating married Russ Lindsay in Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 1991. Their two sons were born in Hammersmith, London. The family settled in Fowey, Cornwall for a few years at the turn of the century.

Keating was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. After undergoing conventional and alternative treatments, and spending a period away from her family on the Gold Coast, Australia, and at a hospice care in Switzerland, she died at the age of 41, on 13 April 2004, at her mother&#x27;s house in Sevenoaks, Kent.

==The Caron Keating Foundation==
Set up in Keating&#x27;s memory, The Caron Keating Foundation is a fund-raising partnership set up to raise money to offer financial support to professional carers, complementary healing practitioners, and support groups dealing with cancer patients, as well as individuals and families who are affected by the disease. It will also financially help a number of cancer charities with their ongoing quest for prevention, early detection and hopefully an ultimate cure. It was set up by her mother, TV presenter Gloria Hunniford, and her two brothers Michael and Paul Keating.

<doc id="473715" wikidata="Q156328" url="?curid=473715" title="Manasseh of Judah">
<text>Manasseh (; Hebrew: &quot;Mənaššé&quot;, &quot;Forgetter&quot;; &quot;Menasî&quot; [&quot;me-na-si-i&quot;]; &quot;Manasses&quot;; ) was the fourteenth king of the Kingdom of Judah. He was the oldest of the sons of Hezekiah and Hephzibah (). He became king at the age of 12 and reigned for 55 years (; ). 

==Biblical account==

The Hebrew Bible documents Manasseh in and . He is also mentioned in Jeremiah 15:4, where the prophet Jeremiah predicts &quot;four forms of destruction&quot; for the people of Judah because of the evil done by Manasseh in Judah.

Manasseh was the first king of Judah who was not contemporary with the northern kingdom of Israel, which the Assyrians had destroyed 720 BC, deporting much of its population. He re-instituted polytheistic worship and reversed the religious changes made by his father Hezekiah – hence his condemnation in several biblical verses.

He married Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah, and they had a son Amon, who succeeded him as king of Judah upon his death. Hezekiah, Manasseh and Amon appear in the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew&#x27;s gospel.

After a reign of 55 years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died 643 BC and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the &quot;garden of his own house&quot; (; ), and not in the City of David, among his ancestors. The biblical narratives report Manasseh&#x27;s accession to the throne at the time of his father&#x27;s death. However, Edwin Thiele concludes that he had commenced his reign as co-regent with his father Hezekiah in 697/696 BC, with the co-regency lasting 12 years and his sole reign beginning in 687/686 BC and continuing until his death in 643/642 BC.

==Relations with Assyria==
When Manasseh&#x27;s reign began, Sennacherib was king of Assyria, who reigned until 681 BC. Manasseh is mentioned in Assyrian records as a contemporary and loyal vassal of Sennacherib&#x27;s son and successor, Esarhaddon. Assyrian records list Manasseh among twenty-two kings required to provide materials for Esarhaddon&#x27;s building projects. Esarhaddon died in 669 BC and was succeeded by his son, Ashurbanipal, who also names Manasseh as one of a number of vassals who assisted his campaign against Egypt.

The Assyrian records are consistent with archaeological evidence of demographic trends and settlement patterns suggesting a period of stability in Judah during Manasseh&#x27;s reign. Despite the criticisms of his religious policies in the biblical texts, archaeologists such as Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman credit Manasseh with reviving Judah&#x27;s rural economy, arguing that a possible Assyrian grant of most favoured nation status stimulated the creation of an export market. They argue that changes to the economic structure of the countryside would have required the cooperation of the &quot;countryside aristocracy&quot;, with restoration of worship at the high places a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for this. Apparent devastation of the fertile Shephelah, coupled with growth of the population of the highlands and the southeast of the kingdom (especially in the Beersheba valley) during Manasseh&#x27;s reign, point to this possibility. Finkelstein has also suggested that Manasseh&#x27;s extensive trade activity as a vassal of Assyria may have provided the basis for some of the biblical stories about King Solomon&#x27;s great acquisition of wealth through foreign trade relationships.

===Olive oil trade===
Olive oil production and export played a big role in the economy of the time. There is evidence in the Gaza area of entrepôt trade, and an apparently flourishing olive oil industry at Ekron. The construction or reconstruction of forts at sites such as Arad and Horvat Uza, explored by Nadav Na&#x27;aman and others, is also argued by Finkelstein and Silberman to be evidence in support of this thesis, as they would have been needed to protect the trade routes. However, Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the trade led to great disparities between rich and poor, which in turn gave rise to civil unrest. As a result, they speculate, the Deuteronomist author or editor of 2 Kings later reworked the traditions about Manasseh to portray his outward-looking involvement in trade as, effectively, apostasy.

==Religious policies==
There are three aspects of Manasseh&#x27;s religious policy which the writer of &quot;Kings&quot; considered deplorable: the religious reaction which followed hard upon his accession; its extension by the free adoption of foreign cults; and the bitter persecution of the prophetic party.

According to Kings, Manasseh reversed the centralizing reforms of his father Hezekiah, and re-established local shrines, possibly for economic reasons. He restored polytheistic worship of Baal and Asherah () in the Temple, and sponsored the Assyrian astral cult throughout Judah. So zealous was he in his worship of the foreign gods, he is said to have participated in the sacrificial cult of Moloch which consisted of sacrificing young children or passing them through fire (2 Kings 21:6) His reign may be described as reactionary in relation to his father&#x27;s, and &quot;Kings&quot; suggests that he may have executed supporters of his father&#x27;s reforms. During Manasseh&#x27;s half-century the popular worship was a medley of native and foreign cults, the influence of which was slow to disappear.

2 Kings 21:10 suggests that several prophets combined their condemnation of Manasseh. The Pulpit Commentary identifies the prophets as probably Isaiah and Habakkuk and possibly Nahum and Zephaniah. Manasseh&#x27;s response was to persecute those who had bitterly condemned the popular syncretism. The prophets were put to the sword (Jeremiah 2:30). Exegetical tradition relates that Isaiah, Manasseh&#x27;s own grandfather, suffered a particularly painful execution, sawn in two under the king&#x27;s orders. &quot;Innocent blood&quot; reddened the streets of Jerusalem. For many decades those who sympathized with prophetic ideas were in constant peril.

Arnold J. Toynbee considers that Manasseh was a pious conservative, defending the faith of his ancestors from Yahweh-only iconoclasts.

===Assyrian detention and repentance===
According to , Manasseh was on one occasion brought in chains to the Assyrian king, possibly Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal, presumably for suspected disloyalty. The verse goes on to indicate that he was later treated well and restored to his throne. In the Chronicler&#x27;s account, the severity of Manasseh&#x27;s imprisonment brought him to repentance. Manasseh was restored to the throne, () and abandoned idolatry, removing the foreign idols () and enjoining the people to worship the Lord of Israel Yahweh. However, neither &quot;Kings&quot; nor Assyrian records mention this incident.

==Chronological notes==
Thiele dates Manasseh&#x27;s reign back from the dates of the reign of his grandson, Josiah. Josiah died at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II in the summer of 609 BC. By Judean reckoning, which began regnal years in the fall month of Tishri, this would be in the year 610/609 BC. Josiah reigned for 31 years (, ) and began to reign after the short two-year reign of Amon. Manasseh&#x27;s last year, 33 years earlier, would be 643/642 BC.

The length of Manasseh&#x27;s reign is given as 55 years in . Assuming non-accession reckoning, as he usually did for coregencies, Thiele determined 54 &quot;actual&quot; years back to 697/696 BC, as the year when the Hezekiah/Manasseh coregency began. Non-accession reckoning means that the first partial year of a king in office was counted twice, once for him and once for his predecessor, so that one year must be subtracted when measuring spans of time. An analysis of the data for Jeroboam II of Israel and Jehoshaphat of Judah, both of whom had coregencies, shows that their years were measured in this way.

Regarding the Hezekiah/Manasseh coregency, Thiele observes Manasseh began his reign when he was 12 years old (), and then comments, &quot;A Hebrew lad when he reached the age of twelve was a &#x27;son of the law&#x27; and had become &quot;gadol&quot;. He had then passed from the days of childhood to youth and was considered old enough to concern himself with the serious work of life ... it is only to be expected that the king, facing the prospect of the termination of his reign within fifteen years [], would at the earliest moment give the heir-presumptive every advantage of training in leadership.&quot;

==In other literature==
In rabbinic literature and Christian pseudepigrapha, Manasseh is accused of executing the prophet Isaiah, who was identified as the maternal grandfather of Manasseh.

The Prayer of Manasseh, a penitential prayer attributed to Manasseh, appears in some Christian Bibles, but is considered apocryphal by Jews, Roman Catholics and Protestants.

Manasseh is also made reference to in chapter 21 of 1 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, where he is used as an example of ungodly king.

<text>The Global Multimedia Protocols Group (GMPG) was founded in March 2003 by Tantek Çelik, Eric A. Meyer, and Matt Mullenweg. The group has developed methods to represent human relationships using XHTML called XHTML Friends Network (XFN) and XHTML Meta Data Profiles (XMDP), for use in weblogs.

GMPG was founded to develop the initial principles for XFN, the XHTML Friends Network as an attempt for the creation of a simple way to express human relationships on the Web within HTML (machine-readable).

, an analysis of the network of pages collected by Common Crawl found that the web host gmpg.org had the highest PageRank and third highest in-degree of all the hosts in the network.

The name of the group was taken from the 1992 cyberpunk novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.

<text>Peter Lawrence Boyle (October 18, 1935 – December 12, 2006) was an American actor. He is known for his character actor roles in film and television and received several awards including a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. 

He is best known for his role as the patriarch Frank Barone on the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; from 1996 to 2005. For his role he received seven nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. For his role as Clyde Bruckman in the Fox science-fiction drama &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 1996 he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

On film, he starred as the comical monster in Mel Brooks&#x27; film spoof &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974). He won praise in both comedic and dramatic parts in &quot;Joe&quot; (1970), &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972), &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973), &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978) and &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; (1980). He later took supporting roles in &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992), &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994), &quot;That Darn Cat&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; (2002). 

==Early life and education==
Peter Lawrence Boyle was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the son of Alice (née Lewis) and Francis Xavier Boyle. He was the youngest of three children and had two elder sisters. He moved with his family to nearby Philadelphia. 

His father, Francis, was a Philadelphia TV personality from 1951 to 1963. Among many other roles, he played the Western show host Chuck Wagon Pete, as well as hosting the after-school children&#x27;s program &quot;Uncle Pete Presents the Little Rascals&quot;, which showed vintage &quot;Little Rascals&quot; and &quot;Three Stooges&quot; comedy shorts alongside &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons. He also appeared at times on Ernie Kovacs&#x27; morning program on WPTZ (now KYW-TV).

Boyle&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his mother was of mostly French, English, Scottish and Irish descent. He was raised Catholic and attended St. Francis de Sales School and West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys. After graduating from high school in 1953, Boyle spent three years in formation with the De La Salle Brothers, a Catholic teaching order. He lived in a house of studies with other novices earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from La Salle University in Philadelphia in 1957, but left the order because he did not feel called to religious life.

While in Philadelphia, he worked as a cameraman on the cooking show &quot;Television Kitchen&quot; hosted by Florence Hanford.

After graduating from Officer Candidate School in 1959, he was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy, but his military career was shortened by a nervous breakdown. In New York City, Boyle studied with acting coach Uta Hagen at HB Studio while working as a postal clerk and a &quot;maitre d&#x27;&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1966–1971: Early roles and breakthrough ===

In 1963, Boyle was hired for the Wayside Theatre&#x27;s opening season. One of his starring roles that year was in &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; by Tennessee Williams. Boyle played Murray the cop in a touring company of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, leaving the tour in Chicago and joining The Second City ensemble there. He had a brief scene as the manager of an indoor shooting range in the critically acclaimed 1969 film &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, filmed in Chicago.

Boyle gained acclaim for his first starring role as the title character, a bigoted New York City factory worker, in the 1970 movie &quot;Joe&quot;. The film&#x27;s release was surrounded by controversy over its violence and language. During this time, Boyle became close friends with actress Jane Fonda, and he participated with her in many protests against the Vietnam War. After seeing people cheer at his role in &quot;Joe&quot;, Boyle refused the lead role in &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), as well as other film and television roles that he believed glamorized violence. However, in 1974, he starred in a film based on the life of murdered New York gangster &quot;Crazy&quot; Joey Gallo, called &quot;Crazy Joe&quot;.

=== 1972–1995: Character actor roles ===
His next major role was as the campaign manager for a U.S. Senate candidate (Robert Redford) in &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1972). In 1973, he appeared in &quot;Steelyard Blues&quot; with Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland, a film about a bunch of misfits trying to get a Catalina flying boat in a scrapyard flying again so they could fly away to somewhere with not so many rules. He also played an Irish mobster opposite Robert Mitchum in &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973). Boyle had another hit role as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in the 1974 Mel Brooks comedy &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, in which, in an homage to &quot;King Kong&quot;, the monster is placed onstage in top hat and tails, grunt-singing and dancing to &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;. Boyle said at the time, &quot;The Frankenstein monster I play is a baby. He&#x27;s big and ugly and scary, but he&#x27;s just been born, remember, and it&#x27;s been traumatic, and to him the whole world is a brand-new, alien environment. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;m playing it&quot;. Boyle met his wife, Loraine Alterman, on the set of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; while she was there as a reporter for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He was still in his Frankenstein makeup when he asked her for a date. Through Alterman and her friend Yoko Ono, Boyle became friends with John Lennon, who was the best man at Boyle and Alterman&#x27;s 1977 wedding. Boyle and his wife had two daughters, Lucy and Amy.

Boyle received his first Emmy nomination for his acclaimed dramatic performance in the 1977 television film &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;, in which he played Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was more often cast as a character actor than as a leading man. His roles include the philosophical cab driver Wizard in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), starring Robert De Niro; a bar owner and fence in &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978); the private detective hired in &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979); the attorney of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson (played by Bill Murray) in &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; (1980); a corrupt space mining-facility boss in the science-fiction film &quot;Outland&quot; (1981), opposite Sean Connery; Boatswain Moon in the (1983) pirate comedy &quot;Yellowbeard&quot;, also starring Cheech and Chong, Madeline Kahn, and members of the comedy troupe Monty Python.

In 1984, he played a local crime boss named Jocko Dundee on his way to retirement, starring Michael Keaton in the comedy film &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot;, a psychiatric patient who belts out a Ray Charles song in the comedy &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (1989), also starring Michael Keaton; a boss of an unscrupulous corporation in the sci-fi movie &quot;Solar Crisis&quot; (1990) with Charlton Heston and Jack Palance; the title character&#x27;s cab driver in &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994), starring Alec Baldwin; the father of Sandra Bullock&#x27;s fiancée in &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; (1995); the corporate raider out to buy Eddie Murphy&#x27;s medical partnership in &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998); the hateful father of Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s prison-guard character in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; (2001); Muta in &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; (2002); and Old Man Wickles in the comedy &quot;Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004). In cameo roles, he can be seen as a police captain in &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992), and as a drawbridge operator in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1985). In 1992, he starred in Alex Cox&#x27;s &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;, an adaptation of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; &quot;La Muerte y la Brujula&quot;. However, the film was not released until 1996.

His New York theater work included playing a comedian who is the object of &quot;The Roast&quot;, a 1980 Broadway play directed by Carl Reiner. Also in 1980, he co-starred with Tommy Lee Jones in an off-Broadway production of playwright Sam Shepard&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;True West&quot;. Two years later, Boyle played the head of a dysfunctional family in Joe Pintauro&#x27;s less well-received &quot;Snow Orchid&quot;, at the Circle Repertory.

In 1986, Boyle played the title role of the television series &quot;Joe Bash&quot;, created by Danny Arnold. The comedy drama followed the life of a lonely, world-weary, and sometimes compromised New York City beat cop, whose closest friend was a prostitute, played by actress DeLane Matthews.

In October 1990, Boyle suffered a near-fatal stroke that rendered him completely speechless and immobile for nearly six months. After recovering, he went on to win an Emmy Award in 1996 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his appearance on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. In the episode, &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot;, he played an insurance salesman who could see selected things in the near future, particularly others&#x27; deaths. Bruckman was named after a real person, also named Clyde Bruckman, who was a comedy director and writer who had worked with Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy and The Three Stooges among others. Boyle also guest-starred in two episodes as Bill Church Sr. in &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. He appears in Sony Music&#x27;s unaired Roger Waters music video &quot;Three Wishes&quot; (1992) as a scruffy genie in a dirty coat and red scarf, who tries to tempt Waters at a desert diner.

Boyle played Frank Barone in the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, which aired from 1996 to 2005. He was nominated for an Emmy seven times for this role and never won, though fellow co-stars Brad Garrett, Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, and Doris Roberts won at least one Emmy each for their performances.

In 1999, he had a heart attack on the set of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. He soon regained his health and returned to the series. After the incident, Boyle was drawn back to his Catholic faith and resumed attending Mass.

In 2001, he appeared in the film &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; as the bigoted father of Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s character. Introduced by comedian Carlos Mencia as &quot;the most honest man in show business&quot;, Boyle made guest appearances on three episodes of the Comedy Central program &quot;Mind of Mencia&quot;, one of which was shown as a tribute in a segment made before Boyle&#x27;s death, in which he read hate mail, explained the &quot;hidden meanings&quot; behind bumper stickers, and occasionally told Mencia how he felt about him.

Starting in late 2005, Boyle and former television wife Doris Roberts appeared in television commercials for the 75th anniversary of Alka-Seltzer, reprising the famous line, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I ate that whole thing!&quot; Although this quote has entered into popular culture, it is often misquoted as, &quot;&quot;...the&quot; whole thing.&quot; Boyle was in all three of &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; films. In the original, he plays Scott Calvin&#x27;s boss Mr. Whittle. In the sequels, he plays Father Time.

==Death and reactions==
On December 12, 2006, Boyle died at the age of 71 at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City after suffering from multiple myeloma and heart disease. At the time of his death, he had completed his roles in the films &quot;All Roads Lead Home&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause&quot;—the latter being released one month before his death—and was scheduled to appear in &quot;The Golden Boys&quot;. The end credits of &quot;All Roads Lead Home&quot; include a dedication to his memory.

Boyle&#x27;s death had a tremendous effect on his former co-stars from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, which had ceased production less than two years before his death. When asked to comment on Boyle&#x27;s death, his cast members heaped praise on Boyle. Ray Romano was personally affected by the loss, saying, &quot;He gave me great advice, he always made me laugh, and the way he connected with everyone around him amazed me.&quot; Patricia Heaton stated, &quot;Peter was an incredible man who made all of us who had the privilege of working with him aspire to be better actors.&quot;

On October 18, 2007 (which would have been Boyle&#x27;s 72nd birthday), his friend Bruce Springsteen dedicated &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; to Boyle during a Madison Square Garden concert with the E Street Band in New York. Springsteen segued into &quot;Jungleland&quot; in memory of Boyle, stating: &quot;An old friend died a while back – we met him when we first came to New York City... Today would have been his birthday.&quot;

After Boyle died, his widow Loraine Alterman Boyle established the Peter Boyle Memorial Fund in support of the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF). Boyle&#x27;s closest friends, family, and co-stars have since gathered yearly for a comedy celebration fundraiser in Los Angeles. Acting as a tribute to Boyle, the annual event is hosted by Ray Romano and has included performances by many comedic veterans including Dana Carvey, Fred Willard, Martin Mull, Richard Lewis, Kevin James, Jeff Garlin, and Martin Short. Performances typically revolve around Boyle&#x27;s life, recalling favorite moments with the actor. The comedy celebration has been noted as the most successful fundraiser in IMF history. The first event held in 2007 raised over $550,000, while the following year over $600,000 was raised for the Peter Boyle Memorial Fund in support of the IMF&#x27;s research programs.

He was interred at Green River Cemetery in Springs, New York.

<text>The Mainland, also known as Hrossey and Pomona, is the main island of Orkney, Scotland. Both of Orkney&#x27;s burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, lie on the island, which is also the heart of Orkney&#x27;s ferry and air connections.

Seventy-five per cent of Orkney&#x27;s population live on the island, which is more densely populated than the other islands of the archipelago. The lengthy history of the island&#x27;s occupation has provided numerous important archaeological sites and the sandstone bedrock provides a platform for fertile farmland. There is an abundance of wildlife, especially seabirds.

==Etymology==
The name Mainland is a corruption of the Old Norse . Formerly the island was also known as meaning &#x27;horse island&#x27;. The island is sometimes referred to as &quot;Pomona&quot; (or &quot;Pomonia&quot;), a name that stems from a 16th-century mis-translation by George Buchanan. The term eventually fell out of widespread use by the early 1800s, yet has aided in differentiating the &quot;Isle of Pomona&quot; from &quot;Mainland Scotland&quot; by emigrants to Canada, England, and other regions, so clings on tenaciously and can still be rarely found locally, retained in the name of the Pomona Inn at Finstown in the parish of Firth, as well as a local café in the capital of Kirkwall also known as the Pomona.

==Geography==
The island is relatively densely populated and has much fertile farmland. The bulk of the Mainland is west of Kirkwall and is low-lying, with coastal cliffs to the north and west and two sizeable bodies of freshwater, the lochs of Stenness and Harray.

The eastern part of the Mainland is shaped like the letter &quot;W&quot;, the easternmost peninsula being known as Deerness. To the south, causeways called Churchill Barriers connect the island to Burray and South Ronaldsay via Lamb Holm and Glimps Holm.

Mainland effectively provides the core of the Orkney Islands, linking the northern members of the archipelago with the southern ones. At the east, and west ends, islands proceed to the north and south, somewhat in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;. The western part of the island is part of the Hoy and West Mainland National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

The population in 2011 was recorded as 17,162, an increase of just over 12% on the 2001 population of 15,315.

===Parishes===
There are 13 parishes on the island. Sandwick, Birsay and Stromness lie on the west coast, Rendall and Evie to the north west. Holm, Deerness and St Andrews are located to the east of central St Ola, which contains Kirkwall city. Firth, Orphir, Stenness and Harray lie west of Kirkwall and east of the westernmost parishes. Harray has the unique distinction of being the only landlocked parish in Orkney, although it too has a significant coast along the Loch of Harray, albeit a freshwater one.

===Economy===
The economic sectors include agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture as well as oil and gas. A 2020 report states that &quot;over the last 20 years there has been a growth in ... manufacturing, tourism, food and drink processing and, more recently, renewable energy&quot;. Tourism is certainly significant with over 190,000 visits to the islands, many on cruise ships, in 2019.

Tourism was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and into 2021. A September 2020 report stated that &quot;The Highlands and Islands region has been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to date, when compared to Scotland and the UK as a whole&quot;. The industry required short-term support for &quot;business survival and recovery&quot; and that was expected to continue as the sector was &quot;severely impacted for as long as physical distancing and travel restrictions&quot;. A scheme called A Support for businesses - Island Equivalent was introduced by the Scottish government in early 2021 to financially assist hospitality and retail businesses &quot;affected by Level 3 coronavirus restrictions&quot;. Previous schemes in 2020 included the Strategic Framework Business Fund and the Coronavirus Business Support Fund.

===Main settlements===

The three main settlements on Mainland, in order of magnitude are Kirkwall and Stromness, both of which are burghs, and Finstown.

;Kirkwall
Kirkwall, the capital of the islands, is on the isthmus between west Mainland and east Mainland, which historically enabled it to have highly active harbours facing in two directions for the southern and northern Orkney Islands; the southern one, Scapa Flow, is a large, calm and immediately ocean-accessible natural harbour. Kirkwall has the seat of the Bishop of Orkney, and St. Magnus Cathedral is to be found there. It is also one of the island&#x27;s ferry ports.

;Stromness
A long-established seaport that grew with the expansion of whaling, Stromness has a population of approximately 2,200 residents. The old town is clustered along the main street, flanked with houses and shops built from local stone, with narrow lanes and alleys branching off it. There is a ferry link to Scrabster in Caithness on the Scottish mainland as well as the Isle of Hoy.

;Finstown
Finstown is the third largest settlement, and used to be known as the &quot;Toon o&#x27; Firth&quot;. The origin of its name is thought to be from an Irishman named David Phin who came to the area in 1811. It is on the direct Stromness to Kirkwall road.

===Geology===
In common with most of the Orkney isles, Mainland rests almost entirely on a bedrock of Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. As in nearby Caithness, these rocks rest upon the metamorphic rocks of the eastern schists, and in Mainland where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.

The Lower Old Red Sandstone is represented by well-bedded flagstones over most of the islands; in the south of Mainland these are faulted against an overlying series of massive red sandstones.

Many indications of glacial action exist in the form of striated surfaces in Kirkwall Bay, with boulder clay with marine shells, and many boulders of rocks foreign to the islands made of chalk, oolitic limestone, flint, &amp;c. Local moraines are found in some of the valleys.

The soil generally is a sandy loam or a strong but friable clay, and very fertile. Large quantities of seaweed as well as lime and marl are available for manure.

===Surrounding islands===

 There are numerous smaller Orkney islands surrounding the mainland, some which are islets only separated at higher stages of the tide, or skerries which are only exposed at lower stages of the tide. These include Barrel of Butter, Bo Skerry, Bow Skerries, Braga, Brough of Bigging, Brough of Birsay, Damsay, Holm of Houton, Holm of Grimbister, Holm of Rendall, Iceland Skerry, Inner Holm, Kirk Rocks, Little Skerry, Mirkady Point, Nevi Skerry, Outer Holm, Oyster Skerries, Puldrite Skerry, Quanterness Skerry, Scare Gun, Seal Skerry, Skaill Skerries, Skerries of Clestrain, Skerries of Coubister, Skerries of Lakequoy, Skerry of Work, Skerry of Yinstay, Smoogro Skerry, Thieves Holm, Whyabatten, and Yesnaby Castle.

The other islands in the Orkney Islands are generally classified as north or south of the Mainland. The exceptions are the remote islets of Sule Skerry and Sule Stack, which lie west of the archipelago, but form part of Orkney for local government purposes.

==History and notable sites==


The western section of the island contains numerous Neolithic and Pictish constructions.

Most of the best known Neoloithic ancient monuments are located in west Mainland, which includes the &quot;Heart of Neolithic Orkney&quot;, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This comprises the large chambered tomb of Maes Howe, the ceremonial stone circles the Standing Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar and the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, together with a number of unexcavated burial, ceremonial and settlement sites. The group constitutes a major prehistoric cultural landscape which gives a graphic depiction of life in the north of Scotland some 5,000 years ago. Nearby is the Barnhouse Settlement, a smaller cluster of prehistoric buildings.

Other sites of interest include St. Magnus Cathedral and the ruin of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Kirkwall, the Earl&#x27;s Palace, a ruined 16th-century castle in Birsay parish, and Skaill House, a manor house and museum near Skara Brae.

Viking settlers comprehensively occupied Orkney, and Mainland became a possession of Norway until being given to Scotland during the 15th century as part of a dowry settlement. Evidence of the Viking presence is widespread, and includes the site of a settlement at the Brough of Birsay, the vast majority of place names, and runic inscriptions at Maeshowe and other ancient sites.

Stromness is of relatively recent origin, being first recorded as the site of an inn in the 16th century, although the name is of Norse origin. Stromness became important during the late 17th century, when England was at war with France and shipping was forced to avoid the English Channel. Ships of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were regular visitors, as were whaling fleets.

The Churchill Barriers are a series of four causeways with a total length of . They link the south of Mainland in the north to the island of South Ronaldsay via Burray and the two smaller islands of Lamb Holm and Glimps Holm. On 14 October 1939, the Royal Navy battleship HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was sunk at her moorings within the natural harbour of Scapa Flow, by the German U-boat &quot;U-47&quot; under the command of Günther Prien. &quot;U-47&quot; had entered Scapa Flow through Holm Sound, one of several eastern entrances to Scapa Flow. To prevent further attacks, Winston Churchill ordered the construction of permanent barriers. They now serve as road links, carrying the A961. Work began in May 1940 and the barriers were completed in September 1944, but were not officially opened until 12 May 1945, four days after the end of World War II in Europe.

==Climate==
The climate is remarkably temperate and steady for such a northerly latitude. The average temperature for the year is , for winter and for summer .

The average annual rainfall varies from . Fogs occur during summer and early autumn, and furious gales may be expected four or five times in the year.

To tourists, one of the fascinations of the islands is their nightless summers. On the longest day, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 21:29 GMT and darkness is unknown. It is possible to read at midnight and very few stars can be seen in the night sky. Winter, however, is long. On the shortest day the sun rises at 09:05 and sets at 15:16.

==Transportation and infrastructure==

===Road===
Mainland contains the vast majority of the island&#x27;s roads, and is also connected to those on the main south east islands, such as South Ronaldsay and Burray thanks to the Churchill Barriers.

There are ideas being discussed to build the Orkney Tunnel, an undersea tunnel between Orkney and the Scottish Mainland, at a length of about or (more likely) one connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay. The Orkney-Caithness route would be connected to Mainland, via the Churchill Barriers, but would make landfall on South Ronaldsay, if constructed.

===Air===
The main airport in Orkney is Kirkwall Airport, operated by Highland and Islands Airports. Loganair provides services to the Scottish Mainland (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness), as well as to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland. Most of the scheduled flights within Orkney depart/arrive at Kirkwall from one of the other islands.

===Ferry===
Ferries serve both to link Orkney to the rest of Scotland, and also to link together the various islands of the Orkney archipelago. Ferry services operate between Orkney and the Scottish Mainland and Shetland on the following routes:

* Lerwick to Kirkwall (operated by NorthLink Ferries)
* Aberdeen to Kirkwall (operated by NorthLink Ferries)
* Scrabster to Stromness (operated by NorthLink Ferries)
* Gills Bay to St Margaret&#x27;s Hope (operated by Pentland Ferries)
Two services also connect Caithness, with South Ronaldsay, which is in turn connected to Mainland by road.

Inter-island ferry services connect all the inhabited islands to Orkney Mainland, and are operated by Orkney Ferries, a company owned by Orkney Islands Council.

==Flora and fauna==
Mainland has a great deal of marine life surrounding it, especially seabirds. Corncrakes can also be found in some parts. The Loch of Harray can host up to 10,000 wintering duck and is important for pochard. Some 4,000 ha of Mainland’s moorland has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of red-throated loons, short-eared owls, hen harriers and merlins.

There are few wild land mammals although there is an endemic sub-species of the common vole, the Orkney vole or cuttick, (&quot;Microtus arvalis orcadensis&quot;) found only in the Orkney archipelago. It may have been introduced by early settlers about 4,000 years ago. Brown hares and rabbits can be found and there are frogs, but no toads.

There are six hundred recorded species of plant on the Orkney Mainland. Two rarities to be found here are the oyster plant (&quot;Mertensia maritima&quot;) and the Scottish primrose (&quot;Primula scotica&quot;). The latter is endemic to the north coast of Scotland, including Orkney and nearby Caithness. It is closely related to the Arctic species &quot;Primula stricta&quot; and &quot;Primula scandinavica&quot;.

<doc id="473726" wikidata="Q3985636" url="?curid=473726" title="The Amateur Scientist">
<text>&quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; was a column in the &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and was the definitive &quot;how-to&quot; resource for citizen-scientists for over 72 years (1928–2001), making it the longest running column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;″s history. The column was regarded for revealing the brass-tacks secrets of research and showing home-based experimenters how to make original discoveries using only inexpensive materials. Since its début in 1928, &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; was a primary resource for science fair projects. It also inspired amateur experimenters, launched careers in science, and enjoyed a place of honor in classrooms and school libraries all over the world.

Although always accessible to an amateur&#x27;s budget, projects from &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; were often elegant and sophisticated. Some designs were so innovative that they set new standards in a field. Indeed, professionals continue to borrow from &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; to find low-cost solutions to real-world research problems.

==Albert Ingalls==
&quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; traces its pedigree to May 1928, when Albert G. Ingalls began the column as &quot;The Back Yard Astronomer.&quot; Ingalls told amateurs how they could get personally involved in astronomy by building professional-quality instruments and carrying out cutting-edge observations. The first sentence in the new column stated: &quot;Here we amateur telescope makers are, more than 3000 of us, gathered together in our own back yard at last.&quot; The name of the column changed several times, to &quot;The Amateur Astronomer&quot;, &quot;The Amateur Telescope Maker&quot;, and &quot;Telescoptics.&quot; Much of the information from these articles was eventually published by Ingalls and Scientific American in the books &quot;Amateur Telescope Making&quot;. The articles and the books are credited with helping to expand the hobby of amateur telescope making. In April 1952, Ingalls chose to broaden the column&#x27;s scope to include &quot;how-to&#x27;s&quot; from all fields of science. When he did, he also changed the department&#x27;s name to &quot;The Amateur Scientist.&quot;

==C. L. Stong==
Ingalls wrote his column for almost 30 years, until his retirement in May 1955. In that year the publisher selected Clair L. Stong to continue the feature. Stong was an electrical engineer from 1926 to 1962 for Westinghouse. He extended the column, frequently peppering it with extremely sophisticated projects including home-built lasers and atom smashers. Many working professional scientists say that they first got hooked on science through Stong&#x27;s amazing columns. One of the activities Stong promoted during the International Geophysical Year was a program for amateur astronomers called Operation Moonwatch. It involved the tracking of artificial satellites by amateurs.

In 1960 Stong compiled a book titled &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot;, (Simon and Schuster) the only collection of articles that has ever been published from this column prior to Carlson and Greaves&#x27; complete CD-collection (see below). However, limited to paper and ink, Stong could only fit in 57 projects. Stong&#x27;s book was reviewed in New Scientist as &quot;most fascinating&quot; and sold well. It went out of print in 1972 and is much sought-after today by amateur scientists and collectors.

==Jearl Walker==
Stong ran the department for over 20 years until he died in 1977. In 1978, &quot;Scientific American&quot; hired Jearl Walker, Ph.D. to take over. Walker had caught the publisher&#x27;s attention thanks to &quot;The Flying Circus of Physics, Answers&quot;, a book Walker wrote which highlighted the fascinating physics of the everyday world. Under Walker&#x27;s stewardship &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; presented fewer how-to projects, and instead focused on the physics of common phenomena.

Walker resigned from &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1990 after 12 years. Collectively, Ingalls, Stong and Walker account for 90 percent of all articles.

==Forrest Mims==
After Walker left, &quot;Scientific American&quot; decided to rededicate the column to hands-on projects and so they offered the column to Forrest Mims III, a renowned writer of books for Radio Shack and an amateur scientist. However, during a conversation between Mims and the publisher, it came up that Mims was an evangelical Christian and creationist who rejected the science of evolution. Not wanting to be perceived as supporting Creationism, &quot;Scientific American&quot; rescinded their offer. Mims charged religious discrimination without success. Ultimately, the magazine published just three of Mims&#x27; articles, along with several letters to the editor concerning his firing.

Although the incident did not diminish &quot;Scientific American&quot;″s commitment to the column, it did make the editors reluctant to offer the column to another amateur scientist. The magazine invited a number of potential columnists to submit articles, some of which it published. But &quot;Scientific American&quot; was unable to find anyone with both professional credentials and the breadth of scientific interests necessary to recapture the popularity the column enjoyed under Stong and Ingalls. Without a regular columnist, the department languished, appearing only sporadically between 1990 and 1995.

==Shawn Carlson==
In 1995 &quot;Scientific American&quot; discovered the Society for Amateur Scientists. Its executive director, Shawn Carlson, Ph.D., was a physicist and established science writer who had left academe a year earlier to devote his career to advancing amateur science. Dr. Carlson took over the column in November of that year and immediately returned its focus to cutting-edge science projects that amateurs can do inexpensively at home. Over one million &quot;Scientific American&quot; readers turned to &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; every month. In 1999, Carlson won a MacArthur Fellowship for science education in part for the innovative projects he developed for &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Scientific American&quot; came under new management. As part of a redesign of the magazine, all of the long-running columns were retired, including &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot;. March 2001 was the last time the column ran in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Archived versions of the column remained available to Scientific American paid subscribers via their website.

Carlson, along with co-editor Sheldon Greaves, Ph.D., created &quot;The Amateur Scientist-The Complete Collection&quot;, a CD-ROM containing all the articles in a fully text-searchable HTML format.

==Online back-issues and CD-ROM==
Sometime after 2007 the &quot;Scientific American&quot; removed the subscriber-only requirement for certain years of the magazine, making &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; column for 1999-2001 available online.

<doc id="473727" wikidata="Q13623710" url="?curid=473727" title="Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)">
<text>The Triple Goddess is a deity or deity archetype revered in many Neopagan religious and spiritual traditions. In common Neopagan usage, the Triple Goddess is viewed as a triunity of three distinct aspects or figures united in one being. These three figures are often described as the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone, each of which symbolizes both a separate stage in the female life cycle and a phase of the Moon, and often rules one of the realms of heavens, earth, and underworld. In various forms of Wicca, her masculine consort is the Horned God.

The Triple Goddess was the subject of much of the writing of early and middle 20th-century poet, novelist and mythographer Robert Graves, in his books &quot;The White Goddess&quot; and &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; as well as in his poetry and novels. Modern neopagan conceptions of the Triple Goddess have been heavily influenced by Graves, who regarded her as the continuing muse of all true poetry, and who speculatively imagined her ancient worship, drawing on the scholarship, fiction and mythology of his time, in particular the work of Jane Ellen Harrison and other Cambridge Ritualists. Hungarian scholar of Greek mythology Karl Kerenyi likewise perceived an underlying triple moon goddess in Greek mythology. Archaeologist Marija Gimbutas also argued for the ancient worship of a universal Triple Goddess in European cultures but, as with Graves, her generalization of these theories to multiple unrelated cultures, and the unsourced homogenization of diverse cultures into one unified cultural and religious figure, has attracted much controversy. Many neopagan belief systems follow Graves&#x27; and Gimbutas&#x27; proposed figure of a universal, cross-cultural Triple Goddess, and these ideas continue to be an influence on feminism, literature, Jungian psychology and literary criticism.

==Origins==
Various triune or triple goddesses, or deities who appeared in groupings of three, were known to ancient religion. Well-known examples include the Tridevi (Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati), Triglav (Slavs), the Charites (Graces), the Horae (Seasons, of which there were three in the ancient Hellenistic reckoning), and the Moirai (Fates). Some deities generally depicted as singular also included triplicate aspects. In Stymphalos, Hera was worshiped as a Girl, a Grown-up, and a Widow.

===Hecate===
According to Robert Graves, Hecate was the &quot;original&quot; and most predominant ancient triple moon goddess. Hecate was represented in triple form from the early days of her worship - although contrary to popular belief, all three forms were usually shown as being the same age. Diana (Artemis) also came to be viewed as a trinity of three goddesses in one, which were viewed as distinct aspects of a single divine being: &quot;Diana as huntress, Diana as the moon, Diana of the underworld.&quot; Additional examples of the goddess Hecate viewed as a triple goddess associated with witchcraft include Lucan&#x27;s tale of a group of witches, written in the 1st century BCE. In Lucan&#x27;s work (LUC. B.C. 6:700-01), the witches speak of &quot;Persephone, who is the third and lowest aspect of our goddess Hecate&quot;. Another example is found in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (Met. 7:94–95), in which Jason swears an oath to the witch Medea, saying he would &quot;be true by the sacred rites of the three-fold goddess.&quot;

The neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry was the first to record an explicit belief that the three aspects of Hecate (an important goddess in the Neoplatonic tradition of Late Antiquity) represented the phases of the moon: new, waxing, and full. In his 3rd century AD work &quot;On Images&quot;, Porphyry wrote: &quot;the moon is Hekate, the symbol of her varying phases and of her power dependent on the phases. Wherefore her power appears in three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in the white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted: the basket, which she bears when she has mounted high, is the symbol of the cultivation of the crops, which she makes to grow up according to the increase of her light: and again the symbol of the full moon is the goddess of the brazen sandals.&quot; Porphyry also associated Hecate with Dionysus, who he said they set beside her partially &quot;on account of their growth of horns&quot;.

===The Graces, Seasons, and Fates===
The specific character of the modern neopagan Maiden, Mother, and Crone archetype is not found in any ancient sources related directly to Hecate, or to most of the triple goddesses or trinities described above. Both Diana and Hecate were almost invariably described as maiden goddesses, with an appearance like that of a young woman. However, according to the 3rd century BC grammarian Epigenes, the three Moirai, or Fates, were regarded by the Orphic tradition as representing the three divisions of the Moon, &quot;the thirtieth and the fifteenth and the first&quot; (i.e. the crescent moon, full moon, and dark moon, as delinted by the divisions of the calendar month). The Moirai themselves were depicted in Renaissance and modern art as a young girl (Clotho), an older woman (Lachesis), and an elderly woman (Atropos), but no surviving art from antiquity depicts them as such. The connection between the Fates and the variously named Triple Moon Goddess, then ultimately led to the conflation of these concepts. Servius made the explicit connection between these phases and the roles of the Moirai: &quot;some call the same goddess Lucina, Diana, and Hecate, because they assign to one goddess the three powers of birth, growth, and death. Some that say that Lucina is the goddess of birth, Diana of growth, and Hecate of death. On account of this three-fold power, they have imagined her as three-fold and three-form, and for that reason they built temples at the meeting of three roads.&quot; Servius&#x27; text included a drawing of a crescent moon (representing the new moon), a half moon (representing the waxing moon), and the full moon.

According to Jane Ellen Harrison:

The three Horae are the three phases of Selene, the Moon waxing, full, and waning. ... [T]he Moon is the true mother of the triple Horae, who are themselves Moirai, and the Moirai, as Orpheus tells us, are but the three &quot;moirai&quot; or divisions (&quot;μέρη&quot;) of the Moon herself, the three divisions of the old year. And these three Moirai or Horae are also Charites.&quot;

The syncretism of the predominant triple moon goddess (a united figure of Diana/Hecate/Selene), combined with the Orphic belief that the Seasons and the Fates were divisions of this same divinity, along with the latter representing the three stages of life, ultimately gave rise to the modern conception of a Triple Goddess whose symbol is the moon and whose triplicity can be conceived of both in terms of the moon&#x27;s phases as the &quot;Maiden, Mother, and Crone&quot;. However, it was not until the early 20th century that this fairly obscure ancient connection was developed and popularized.

==Modern development==
===Jane Ellen Harrison===
The belief in a singular Triple Moon Goddess was likely brought to modern scholarship, if not originated by, the work of Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison asserts the existence of female trinities, and uses Epigenes and other ancient sources to elaborate on the Horae, Fates, and Graces as chronological symbols representing the phases of the Moon and the threefold division of the Hellenistic lunar month.

However, Harrison&#x27;s interpretations and contribution to the development and study of the Triple Goddess were somewhat overshadowed by the more controversial and poorly-supported ideas in her works. Most notably, Harrison used historical sources for the existence of an ancient Triple Moon Goddess to support her belief in an ancient matriarchal civilization, which has not stood up to academic scrutiny. Ronald Hutton writes:

[Harrison&#x27;s] work, both celebrated and controversial, posited the previous existence of a peaceful and intensely creative woman-centred civilization, in which humans, living in harmony with nature and their own emotions, worshipped a single female deity. The deity was regarded as representing the earth, and as having three aspects, of which the first two were Maiden and Mother; she did not name the third. ... Following her work, the idea of a matristic early Europe which had venerated such a deity was developed in books by amateur scholars such as Robert Briffault&#x27;s &quot;The Mothers&quot; (1927) and Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot; (1948).

John Michael Greer writes:

Harrison proclaimed that Europe itself had been the location of an idyllic, goddess-worshipping, matriarchal civilization just before the beginning of recorded history, and spoke bitterly of the disastrous consequences of the Indo-European invasion that destroyed it. In the hands of later writers such as Robert Graves, Jacquetta Hawkes, and Marija Gimbutas, this &#x27;lost civilization of the goddess&#x27; came to play the same sort of role in many modern Pagan communities as Atlantis and Lemuria did in Theosophy.

The &quot;myth and ritual&quot; school or the Cambridge Ritualists, of which Harrison was a key figure, while controversial in its day, is now considered passé in intellectual and academic terms. According to Robert Ackerman, &quot;[T]he reason the Ritualists have fallen into disfavor... is not that their assertions have been controverted by new information... Ritualism has been swept away not by an access of new facts but of new theories.&quot;

Ronald Hutton wrote on the decline the &quot;Great Goddess&quot; theory specifically: &quot;The effect upon professional prehistorians was to make most return, quietly and without controversy, to that careful agnosticism as to the nature of ancient religion which most had preserved until the 1940s. There had been no absolute disproof of the veneration of a Great Goddess, only a demonstration that the evidence concerned admitted of alternative explanations.&quot; Hutton did not dispute that in ancient pagan worship &quot;partnerships of three divine women&quot; occurred; rather he proposed that Jane Harrison looked to such partnerships to help explain how ancient goddesses could be both virgin and mother (the third person of the triad being as yet unnamed). She was, according to Hutton, &quot;extending&quot; the ideas of archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans who in excavating Knossos in Crete had come to the view that prehistoric Cretans had worshiped a single mighty goddess at once virgin and mother. In Hutton&#x27;s view Evans&#x27; opinion owed an &quot;unmistakable debt&quot; to the Christian belief in the Virgin Mary.

===Jungian archetype theory===
The Triple Goddess as an archetype is discussed in the works of both Carl Jung and Karl Kerényi, and the later works of their follower Erich Neumann. Jung considered the general arrangement of deities in triads as a pattern which arises at the most primitive level of human mental development and culture.

In 1949 Jung and Kerényi theorized that groups of three goddesses found in Greece become quaternities only by association with a male god. They give the example of Diana only becoming three (Daughter, Wife, Mother) through her relationship to Zeus, the male deity. They go on to state that different cultures and groups associate different numbers and cosmological bodies with gender.

Kerenyi wrote in 1952 that several Greek goddesses were triple moon goddesses of the Maiden Mother Crone type, including Hera and others. For example, Kerényi writes:

With Hera the correspondences of the mythological and cosmic transformation extended to all three phases in which the Greeks saw the moon: she corresponded to the waxing moon as maiden, to the full moon as fulfilled wife, to the waning moon as abandoned withdrawing women&quot;.

He goes on to say that trios of sister goddess in Greek myth refer to the lunar cycle; in the book in question he treats Athene also as a triple moon goddess, noting the statement by Aristotle that Athene was the Moon but not &quot;only&quot; the Moon.

In discussing examples of his Great Mother archetype, Neumann mentions the Fates as &quot;the threefold form of the Great Mother&quot;, details that &quot;the reason for their appearance in threes or nines, or more seldom in twelves, is to be sought in the threefold articulation underlying all created things; but here it refers most particularly to the three temporal stages of all growth (beginning-middle-end, birth-life-death, past-present-future).&quot; Andrew Von Hendy writes that Neumann&#x27;s theories are based on circular reasoning, whereby a Eurocentric view of world mythology is used as evidence for a universal model of individual psychological development which mirrors a sociocultural evolutionary model derived from European mythology.

===Robert Graves===
As a poet and mythographer, Robert Graves claimed a historical basis for the Triple Goddess. Although Graves&#x27;s work is widely discounted by academics as pseudohistory (see The White Goddess § Criticism and The Greek Myths § Reception), it continues to have a lasting influence on many areas of Neopaganism.

Ronald Hutton argues that the concept of the triple moon goddess as Maiden, Mother, and Crone, each facet corresponding to a phase of the moon, is a modern creation of Graves&#x27;, who in turn drew on the work of 19th and 20th century scholars such as especially Jane Harrison; and also Margaret Murray, James Frazer, the other members of the &quot;myth and ritual&quot; school of Cambridge Ritualists, and the occultist and writer Aleister Crowley.

While Graves was the originator of the idea of the Triple Goddess as embodying Maiden/Mother/Crone, this was not the only trinity he proposed. In his 1944 historical novel &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;, Graves wrote &quot;Maiden, Nymph and Mother are the eternal royal Trinity...and the Goddess, who is worshipped...in each of these aspects, as New Moon, Full Moon, and Old Moon, is the sovereign deity.&quot;

In his best-known work, &quot;The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth&quot; (1948), Graves described the trinity of the Triple Goddess in several different ways:

*Representing stages of a woman&#x27;s life:
** Maiden/Nymph/Hag
** Maiden/Mother/Crone
*Representing the women associated with stages of a man&#x27;s life:
** Mother/Bride/Layer-out

Graves explained, &quot;As Goddess of the Underworld she was concerned with Birth, Procreation and Death. As Goddess of the Earth she was concerned with the three season of Spring, Summer and Winter: she animated trees and plants and ruled all living creatures. As Goddess of the Sky she was the Moon, in her three phases of New Moon, Full Moon, and Waning Moon...As the New Moon or Spring she was a girl; as the Full Moon or Summer she was woman; as the Old Moon or Winter she was hag.&quot;

In the 1949 novel &quot;Seven Days in New Crete&quot;, Graves extrapolated this theory into an imagined future society where the worship of the Triple Goddess (under the three aspects of the maiden archer Nimuë, the goddess of motherhood and sexuality Mari, and the hag-goddess of wisdom Ana) is the main form of religion.

Graves wrote extensively on the subject of the Triple Goddess who he saw as the Muse of all true poetry in both ancient and modern literature. He thought that her ancient worship underlay much of classical Greek myth although reflected there in a more or less distorted or incomplete form. As an example of an unusually complete survival of the &quot;ancient triad&quot; he cites from the classical source Pausanias the worship of Hera in three persons. Pausanias recorded the ancient worship of &quot;Hera Pais&quot; (Girl Hera), &quot;Hera Teleia&quot; (Adult Hera), and &quot;Hera Khera&quot; (Widow Hera, though &quot;Khera&quot; can also mean separated or divorced) at a single sanctuary reputedly built by Temenus, son of Pelasgus, in Stymphalos. Other examples he gives include the goddess triad Moira, Ilythia and Callone (&quot;Death, Birth and Beauty&quot;) from Plato&#x27;s Symposium; the goddess Hecate; the story of the rape of Kore (the triad here Graves said to be Kore, Persephone and Hecate with Demeter the general name of the goddess); alongside a large number of other configurations. A figure he used from outside of Greek myth was of the Akan Triple Moon Goddess Ngame, who Graves said was still worshipped in 1960.

Graves regarded &quot;true poetry&quot; as inspired by the Triple Goddess, as an example of her continuing influence in English poetry he instances the &quot;Garland of Laurell&quot; by the English poet, John Skelton (c.1460–1529) — &quot;Diana in the leavës green, Luna that so bright doth sheen, Persephone in Hell.&quot; — as evoking his Triple Goddess in her three realms of earth, sky and underworld. Skelton was here following the Latin poet Ovid. James Frazer&#x27;s seminal Golden Bough centres around the cult of the Roman goddess Diana who had three aspects, associated with the Moon, the forest, and the underworld.

Graves stated that his Triple Goddess is the Great Goddess &quot;in her poetic or incantatory character&quot;, and that the goddess in her ancient form took the gods of the waxing and waning year successively as her lovers. Graves believed that the Triple Goddess was an aboriginal deity also of Britain, and that traces of her worship survived in early modern British witchcraft and in various modern British cultural attitudes such as what Graves believed to be a preference for a female sovereign.

In the anthology &quot;The Greek Myths&quot; (1955), Graves systematically applied his convictions enshrined in &quot;The White Goddess&quot; to Greek mythology, exposing a large number of readers to his various theories concerning goddess worship in ancient Greece. Graves posited that Greece had been settled by a matriarchal goddess-worshipping people before being invaded by successive waves of patriarchal Indo-European speakers from the north. Much of Greek myth in his view recorded the consequent religious political and social accommodations until the final triumph of patriarchy.

Graves did not invent this picture but drew from nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship. According to Ronald Hutton, Graves used Jane Ellen Harrison&#x27;s idea of goddess-worshipping matriarchal early Europe and the imagery of three aspects, and related these to the Triple Goddess. This theory has not necessarily been disproved, but modern scholarship has favored other explanations for the evidence used by Graves and Harrison to support their ideas, which are not accepted as a consensus view today. The twentieth century archaeologist Marija Gimbutas (see below) also argued for a triple goddess-worshipping European neolithic modified and eventually overwhelmed by waves of partiarchal invaders although she saw this neolithic civilization as egalitarian and &quot;matristic&quot; rather than &quot;matriarchal&quot; in the sense of gynocratic.

===Marija Gimbutas===
Scholar Marija Gimbutas&#x27;s theories relating to goddess-centered culture among pre-Indo-European &quot;Old Europe&quot; (6500–3500 BCE) have been widely adopted by New Age and ecofeminist groups. She had been referred to as the &quot;Grandmother of the Goddess Movement&quot; in the 1990s.

Gimbutas postulated that in &quot;Old Europe&quot;, the Aegean and the Near East, a single great Triple Goddess was worshipped, predating what she deemed as a patriarchal religion imported by the Kurgan culture, nomadic speakers of Indo-European languages. Gimbutas interpreted iconography from Neolithic and earlier periods of European history evidence of worship of a triple goddess represented by:
# &quot;stiff nudes&quot;, birds of prey or poisonous snakes interpreted as &quot;death&quot;
# mother-figures interpreted as symbols of &quot;birth and fertility&quot;
# moths, butterflies or bees, or alternatively a frog, hedgehog or bull&#x27;s head symbolizing the uterus or fetus, representing &quot;regeneration&quot;

The first and third aspects of the goddess, according to Gimbutas, were frequently conflated to make a goddess of death-and-regeneration represented in folklore by such figures as Baba Yaga. Gimbutas regarded the Eleusinian Mysteries as a survival into classical antiquity of this ancient goddess worship, a suggestion which Georg Luck echoes.

Academic skepticism regarding her goddess-centered Old Europe thesis is widespread. Gimbutas&#x27; evidence has been criticized on the grounds of dating, archaeological context, and typologies, with most archaeologists considering her goddess hypothesis implausible. Lauren Talalay, reviewing Gimbutas&#x27;s last book, &quot;The Living Goddesses&quot;, says that it reads &quot;more like a testament of faith than a well-conceived thesis&quot;, stating that &quot;Just because a triangle schematically mimics the female pubic region, or a hedgehog resembles a uterus (!), or dogs are allied with death in Classical mythology, it is hardly justifiable to associate all these images with &#x27;the formidable goddess of regeneration&#x27;.&quot; Lynn Meskell considers such an approach &quot;irresponsible&quot;. However, linguist M. L. West has called Gimbutas&#x27;s fundamental thesis of a goddess-based &quot;Old European&quot; religion being overtaken by a patriarchal Indo-European one &quot;essentially sound&quot;.

Academic rejection of her theories has been echoed by some feminist authors, including Cynthia Eller. Others argue that her account challenges male-centred histories and creates a powerful origin-myth of female empowerment. John Chapman suggests that Gimbutas&#x27; Goddess theories were a poetic projection of her personal life, based on her idealized childhood and adolescence.

==Contemporary beliefs and practices==
While most Neopagans are not Wiccan, and within Neopaganism the practices and theology vary widely, many Wiccans and other neopagans worship the &quot;Triple Goddess&quot; of maiden, mother, and crone. In their view, sexuality, pregnancy, breastfeeding—and other female reproductive processes—are ways that women may embody the Goddess, making the physical body sacred.

* The Maiden represents enchantment, inception, expansion, the promise of new beginnings, birth, youth and youthful enthusiasm, represented by the waxing moon;
* The Mother represents ripeness, fertility, sexuality, fulfilment, stability, power and life represented by the full moon;
* The Crone represents wisdom, repose, death, and endings represented by the waning moon.

Helen Berger writes that &quot;according to believers, this echoing of women&#x27;s life stages allowed women to identify with deity in a way that had not been possible since the advent of patriarchal religions.&quot; The Church of All Worlds is one example of a neopagan organization which identifies the Triple Goddess as symbolizing a &quot;fertility cycle&quot;. This model is also supposed to encompass a personification of all the characteristics and potential of every woman who has ever existed. Other beliefs held by worshippers, such as Wiccan author D. J. Conway, include that reconnection with the Great Goddess is vital to the health of humankind &quot;on all levels&quot;. Conway includes the Greek goddesses Demeter, Kore-Persephone, and Hecate, in her discussion of the Maiden-Mother-Crone archetype. Conway specifically believes the Triple Goddess stands for unity, cooperation, and participation with all creation, while in contrast masculine gods can represent dissociation, separation and dominion of nature.

The Dianic tradition adopted Graves&#x27;s Triple Goddess, along with other elements from Wicca, and is named after the Roman goddess Diana, the goddess of the witches in Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1899 book &quot;Aradia&quot;. Zsuzsanna Budapest, widely considered the founder of Dianic Wicca, considers her Goddess &quot;the original Holy Trinity; Virgin, Mother, and Crone.&quot; Dianic Wiccans such as Ruth Barrett, follower of Budapest and co-founder of the &quot;Temple of Diana&quot;, use the Triple Goddess in ritual work and correspond the &quot;special directions&quot; of &quot;above&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, and &quot;below&quot; to Maiden, Mother, and Crone respectively. Barrett says &quot;Dianics honour &quot;She who has been called&quot; by Her daughters throughout time, in many places, and by many names.&quot;

Some neopagans believe that the Triple Goddess is an archetypal figure which appears in a number of different cultures throughout human history, and that many individual goddesses can be interpreted as Triple Goddesses. The wide acceptance of an archetype theory has led to neopagans adopting the images and names of culturally divergent deities for ritual purposes; for instance, Conway, and goddess feminist artist Monica Sjöö, connect the Triple Goddess to the Hindu Tridevi (literally &quot;three goddesses&quot;) of Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati (Kali/Durga). Several advocates of Wicca, such as Vivianne Crowley and Selena Fox, are practising psychologists or psychotherapists and looked specifically to the work of Carl Jung to develop the theory of the Goddess as an archetype. Wouter J. Hanegraaff comments that Vivianne Crowley&#x27;s works can give the impression that Wicca is little more than a religious and ritual translation of Jungian psychology.

Valerie H. Mantecon follows Annis V. Pratt that the Triple Goddess of Maiden, Mother and Crone is a male invention that both arises from and biases an androcentric view of femininity, and as such the symbolism is often devoid of real meaning or use in depth-psychology for women. Mantecon suggests that a feminist re-visioning of the Crone symbolism away from its usual associations with &quot;death&quot; and towards &quot;wisdom&quot; can be useful in women transitioning to the menopausal phase of life and that the sense of history that comes from working with mythological symbols adds a sense of meaning to the experience.

==Fiction, film, and literary criticism==
Author Margaret Atwood recalls reading Graves&#x27;s &quot;The White Goddess&quot; at the age of 19. Atwood describes Graves&#x27; concept of the Triple Goddess as employing violent and misandric imagery, and says the restrictive role this model places on creative women put her off being a writer. Atwood&#x27;s work has been noted as containing Triple Goddess motifs who sometimes appear failed and parodic. Atwood&#x27;s &quot;Lady Oracle&quot; has been cited as a deliberate parody of the Triple Goddess, which subverts the figure and ultimately liberates the lead female character from the oppressive model of feminine creativity that Graves constructed.

Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; series provides another parodic take on the concept, with covens of witches generally made up of &quot;The Maiden, the Mother, and the...Other One.&quot; It also plays with the concept in different ways; for example, Nanny Ogg is generally &quot;the Mother&quot; of the main witch trio, but is actually as old as Granny Weatherwax, while commenting that she never qualified as the Maiden mentally.

Literary critic Andrew D. Radford, discussing the symbolism of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s 1891 novel &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, in terms of Myth sees the Maiden and Mother as two phases of the female lifecycle through which Tess passes, whilst the Crone phase, Tess adopts as a disguise which prepares her for harrowing experiences .

The concept of the triple goddess has been applied to a feminist reading of Shakespeare.

Thomas DeQuincey developed a female trinity, Our Lady of Tears, the Lady of Sighs and Our Lady of Darkness, in &quot;Suspiria De Profundis&quot;, which has been likened to Graves&#x27;s Triple Goddess but stamped with DeQuincey&#x27;s own melancholy sensibility.

According to scholar Juliette Wood, modern fantasy fiction plays a large part in the conceptual landscape of the neo-pagan world. The three supernatural female figures called variously the Ladies, Mother of the Camenae, the Kindly Ones, and a number of other different names in &quot;The Sandman&quot; comic books by Neil Gaiman, merge the figures of the Fates and the Maiden-Mother-Crone goddess. Alan Garner&#x27;s &quot;The Owl Service&quot;, based on the fourth branch of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; and influenced by Robert Graves, clearly delineates the character of the Triple Goddess. Garner goes further in his other novels, making every female character intentionally represent an aspect of the Triple Goddess. In George R.R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, the Maid, the Mother, and the Crone are three aspects of the septune deity in the Faith of the Seven, much as the neopagan triple goddess is incorporated in Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;.

Graves&#x27;s Triple Goddess motif has been used by Norman Holland to explore the female characters in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Roz Kaveney sees the main characters in James Cameron&#x27;s movie &quot;Aliens&quot; as: The Alien Queen (Crone), Ripley (Mother) and Newt (Maiden).

American heavy metal band The Sword&#x27;s song, &quot;Maiden, Mother &amp; Crone&quot;, on their album &quot;Gods of the Earth&quot;, describes an encounter with the Triple Goddess. The video features three aspects of the goddess and a waxing, full, and waning moon.

<text>The year 1631 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* November 7 – Using Kepler&#x27;s predictions of planetary transits made in 1630, Pierre Gassendi makes the first recorded observation of the transit of Mercury. The observed size of Mercury&#x27;s disc is significantly smaller than had been expected from Ptolemaic theory.

==Geology==
* December 16 – Volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius for the only time this century.

==Mathematics==
* William Oughtred publishes &quot;Clavis Mathematicae&quot;, introducing the multiplication sign (×) and proportion sign (::).
* Some of Thomas Harriot&#x27;s writings on algebra are published posthumously as &quot;Artis Analyticae Praxis&quot;.

==Technology==
* Earliest known bentside spinet, made by Hieronymus de Zentis.

==Births==
* &quot;approx. date&quot;
** William Ball, English astronomer (died 1690)
** Richard Lower, English physician, performs first direct blood transfusion (died 1691)

==Deaths==
* October 20 – Michael Maestlin, German astronomer and mathematician (born 1550)
* October 26 – Catherine de Parthenay, French noblewoman and mathematician (b. 1554)
* December 10 – Sir Hugh Myddelton, Welsh-born goldsmith and hydraulic engineer (born c. 1560)

<text>Gaja Alaga (3 July 1924 – 7 September 1988) was a Croatian theoretical physicist who specialised in nuclear physics.

He was born in noble family of Bunjevac origin in the village of Lemeš (today called &quot;Svetozar Miletić&quot;) in northwestern Bačka in Kingdom of SHS (today in autonomous province Vojvodina, Serbia).

He was a corresponding member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1968 and a professor at the University of Zagreb Faculty of Science (). He worked in the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb (the capital city of Croatia), the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, the University of California, Berkeley, and Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich.

In 1955, cooperating with Kurt Alder and Ben Roy Mottelson, Alaga discovered the K-selection rules and intensity rules for beta and gamma transitions in deformed atom nuclei. This discovery was key to the development of new nuclei models which confirmed that subatomic particles can distort the shape of the nucleus. This is by the model for collective motion (based on nuclei deformed from a spherical shape, but with axial symmetry) for which Aage Bohr, Ben Roy Mottelson, and James Rainwater won the 1975 Nobel Prize.

Also in 1955 (the journal &quot;Physical Review&quot;) and in 1957 (the journal &quot;Nuclear Physics&quot;) he discovered asymptotic selection rules for beta and gamma transitions between states of deformed nuclei. The so-called Alaga rules are in common use among specialists in nuclear structure, in comparing theoretical transition rates with measurements.

He was the editor of the scientific magazine &quot;Fizika&quot; from 1978 until he died in 1988.

He died in Zagreb in 1988. Today, a street in the Trnje city district of Zagreb bears his name.

<text>The New York–New Jersey Harbor Estuary has a variety of flora and fauna. Much of the harbor originally consisted of tidal marshes that have been dramatically transformed by the development of port facilities.
The estuary itself supports a great variety of thriving estuarine aquatic species; contrary to popular stereotypes, New York Harbor and its adjacent, interdependent waters are very much alive, and steadily recovering from pollution; ecologically it is true that these waters were once dead or extremely toxic but after 45 years of cleaning the estuary is in a much better state than it has been in a hundred years. Tidal flow occurs as far north as Troy, over 150 miles away. The salt front (dilute salt water) can reach Poughkeepsie in drought conditions and is present in the lower reaches of the Raritan River for most of the year.

==Animal species==

===Arthropods===
* American lobster (&quot;Homarus americanus&quot;) - Massachusetts Bay is not the only home of the lobster on the East Coast. Usually found south of the Verrazano Bridge, near the Southwestern end of Long Island and just off Sandy Hook. Often attracted to artificial reefs found near Lower New York Bay, where they can reach very large sizes, and just offshore near Ocean County, New Jersey. Depredation by man within the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is extremely rare. Some specimens can be as long as a man&#x27;s arm.
* Atlantic rock crab (&quot;Cancer irroratus&quot;) - A common crab found on the continental shelf within ten miles of shoreline. Found in all parts of the estuary. There is some concern over it competing with the invasive European green crab for habitat, but it is believed that the presence of &quot;Callinectes&quot; genera in the bight may offer some refuge as it has been shown that the swimmer crabs of this genus like to prey upon the smaller green crab.
*Blue crab (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;) - Also known as the &quot;blue claw crab&quot;. The crabs are typically found in the mouth of the Hudson River and occasionally wander into the brackish waters of small rivers and coves that pepper the western side of Long Island, including the waters just off Coney Island. Up the Hudson they are found occasionally in the part of the river that runs through the lower Hudson Valley in the summertime. Up until the 1960s they could be eaten, but the State of New York currently recommends against attempting to do so on a regular basis, due to bioaccumulation of PCBs and cadmium that were discovered in the crabs in the 1970s. On the upside, a lack of hunting by man has caused this crab&#x27;s numbers to grow heartily while others (Chesapeake Bay) have decreased. Females bearing eggs should be let go immediately because if they are not it affects the next generation.
*Ghost crab (&quot;Ocypode quadrata&quot;) - Common sight after twilight scurrying along the beaches of western Long Island and the planktonic larvae are found throughout the estuary.
*Atlantic horseshoe crab (&quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;) - A common visitor to Breezy Point, Rockaways, and Coney Island. Numbers in peril but not yet a candidate as an endangered species. The New York Horseshoe Crab Monitoring Network conducts a citizen science annual census at different sites.
*Lady crab (&quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot;)
*Portly spider crab (&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot;) A species of decorator crab. Like most spider crab It is edible though rarely in the USA on account of appearance. 
*Ivory barnacle (&quot;Amphibalanus eburneus&quot;)
*Northern rock barnacle (&quot;Semibalanus balanoides&quot;)
*Asian shore crab (&quot;Hemigraspus sanguineus&quot;) An invasive alien species that is a favorite food of seagulls and other shorebirds in the area.
*Common Spider Crab (&quot;Libinia emarginata&quot;)
*Green Crab (&quot;Carcinus maenus&quot;) This species is an invasive species originally from Europe that has been present in all waters of the State of New York for many decades. It is a swimmer crab that is present in most parts of the harbor and is easily distinguished from the blue crab by being much smaller and a dull green color. 
*Black fingered mud crab (&quot;Panopeus herbstii&quot;)
*Gammarid Amphipod (&quot;Family Gammaridae&quot;)
*Corophid amphipod (&quot;Family Corophiidae&quot;)
*Skeleton Shrimp (&#x27;Family Caprellida&quot;)
*Shore Shrimp, Grass Shrimp (&quot;Palaemonetes spp.&quot;)
*Sea Roach (&quot;Family idoteidae&quot;)
*White fingered mud crab (&quot;Rhithropanopeus harrisii&quot;)

===Chordates===

====Birds====
Although not aquatic animals, these birds are supported by the food and habitat the harbor provides, particularly Jamaica Bay and the Pelham Islands. Many of these birds will fly within sight of the Manhattan skyline and the estuary is a very important point for the East Coast because of its location: it is dead center in the Atlantic Flyway and many raptors and waterfowl use this spot as a rest area along their journey from New England and Canada in fall before heading further south to the Southern States and the Caribbean, reversing the journey in late March and early April.

*American herring gull (&quot;Larus smithsonianus&quot;) A common sight that is present almost year round. Some will nest on the many tall buildings afforded in all five boroughs, none of which is more than a few miles from the water. 
*American oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus pallatius&quot;)
*American wigeon (&quot;Anas americana&quot;)
*Bald eagle (&quot;Halieeatus leucocephalus&quot;) - Has been seen up the Hudson River every winter consistently for well over a decade, feeding on a wide variety of both freshwater and saltwater fish. Has also been seen using the New Jersey Palisades and piers near the Harlem River as a perch from which to swoop down and grab its quarry in the estuary. Will occasionally make itself known in the Lower Harbor seeking schools of mackerel.
*Black bellied plover (&quot;Pluvialis squatarola)&quot;
*Black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;)
*Black skimmer (&quot;Rynchops niger&quot;)
*Brant (&quot;Branta bernicla hrota&quot;)
*Brown pelican (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;) This bird migrates north from the Chesapeake and Outer Banks in the late spring and does not go back until roughly late September. Occasionally will perch on docks. Prefers alewives and mossbunker; should not be fed so much as a morsel if found on the docks as it can become habituated to humans and an unhealthy diet.
*Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;)
*Glossy ibis (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus)&quot; A common bird in the summertime in Jamaica Bay and in the shallows on the Pelham Islands.
*Great blue heron (&quot;Ardea herodia&quot;) Often found on Staten Island near the water.
*Green heron &quot;(Butorides virescens)&quot; Will take to feeding in the Bronx River in summertime. Also found occasionally in Jamaica Bay and marshy portions on the New Jersey side of the estuary, attracted by small fish. 
*Mallard (&quot;Anas platyryncha&quot;) The most common dabbling duck in the region. A common visitor to brackish portions of the lower Raritan as well as Staten Island. 
*Northern gannet &quot;(Morus bassanus)&quot; A member of the booby family. Will dive head first into the water after fish. 
*Osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) - A very common sight in the skies over western Long Island, especially during the nesting months. Easily seen near Jamaica Bay.
*Piping plover (&quot;Charadrius melodus)-&quot;A bird that likes to nest on beaches like the ones near Rockaways and the Pelham Islands. This plover in particular is very tiny and beachgoers must mind their step near sand dunes as they can be missed. Has a pleasant sounding call. Likes to nest on sandy beaches and can be difficult to see during nesting season, as it tries to camouflage itself. This is a very nervous, endangered species that must remain unmolested during nesting as it will abandon its eggs if stressed; birdwatchers are advised to remain very, very quiet and to maintain a long distance from the nest so as not to frighten the bird.
*Red knot (&quot;Calidris canutus rufa)&quot; The estuary is a place where the red knot likes to rest as it migrated back to its breeding grounds in the Arctic. Small flocks can be seen in the spring and early summer. This bird&#x27;s numbers are threatened, and so it must remain undisturbed.
*Snowy egret (&quot;Egretta thula&quot;) A common visitor to streams and salt marshes in the summer. Will on rare occasions be found foraging and relaxing in parks and rivers in the estuary system like the Bronx River. Males have very distinct breeding plumage.
*Yellow-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax violaceus&quot;) - Nests on some of the uninhabited islands in the harbor and feasts upon the fish in the ocean and frogs in the streams and ponds in parks.

====Fish====
*Alewife (&quot;Alosa pseudoharengus&quot;)
*American anglerfish &quot;(Lophius americanus)&quot; Easily the homeliest fish in the water; Prefers the deepest parts of the estuary and Sandy Hook. Sold in local farmer&#x27;s markets as monkfish, even though it is not a monkfish in &quot;strictu senso.&quot;
*American butterfish (&quot;Peprilus triacanthus&quot;)
*American eel (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;)-Numbers are low; currently on IUCN redlist. Should gently put back exactly where it was found and not bought from any vendor nor taken home to eat anywhere in New York or New Jersey. Will travel thousands of miles to reproduce in Sargasso Sea every year. The Hudson River is a known haunt of this fish as is Upper New York Bay.
*American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;) Anadramous fish that once was found as far inland as Bridgewater New Jersey and a former abundant resident of the Raritan River showing signs of returning.
*American silver perch &quot;(Bairdiella chrysoura)&quot;
*Atlantic croaker (&quot;Micropogonias undulatus&quot;)
*Atlantic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus&quot;)
*Atlantic menhaden (&quot;Brevoortia tyrannus&quot;)-Also known as &quot;mossbunker&quot;. This fish is a success story. In the 1940s and 1950s, the waters of the Estuary were very badly polluted and had been polluted since at least the mid 19th century. By the time of the Clean Water Act, the waters surrounding New York City were ecologically dead or dying. As of 2018, however, the water is clean enough to support this fish in obscenely large numbers, which have in turn triggered the return of whales, dolphins, and sharks to the harbor.
*Atlantic moonfish &quot;(Selene setapinnis)&quot; Likes to school in large numbers.
*Atlantic needlefish (&quot;Strongylura marina&quot;)
*Atlantic silverside (&quot;Menidia menidia&quot;)
*Atlantic sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser oxyrinchus&quot;) - Found in the depths of Upper New York Bay, in the main channel of the Hudson River; it also can and does migrate long distances from the mouth of the Hudson. This fish is very large as an adult and can grow to 14 feet long. It should be put back at once if caught on a line and the state environmental authorities should be contacted, with a photograph if possible. The Atlantic sturgeon is an endangered fish that has been the victim of overfishing for caviar as well as the alteration of its habitat in too many rivers along the East Coast. The Hudson River and the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a clear nursery for this fish as well as a stronghold for the species overall: the most recent research suggests that the remaining populations in other rivers in other states are interconnected with New York&#x27;s, evidenced by tracking devices. Other populations in Europe were, at one point, completely wiped out. 
*Banded killifish &quot;(Fundulus diaphanus)&quot;
*Bay anchovy &quot;(Anchoa mitchilli)&quot;
*Black drum (&quot;Pogonias cromis&quot;)
*Black seabass &quot;(Centropristis striata)&quot;
*Blueback herring (&quot;Alosa aestivalis)&quot;
*Bluefish (&quot;Pomatomus saltatrix&quot;)
*Cunner (&quot;Tautogolabrus adspersus)&quot;
*Crevalle jack &quot;(Caranx hippos)&quot;
*Foureye butterflyfish &quot;(Chaetodon capistratus)&quot;
*Fourspot flounder &quot;(Hippoglossina oblonga)&quot;
*Gizzard shad (&quot;Dorosoma cepedianum&quot;)
*Hogchoker (&quot;Trinectes maculatus)&quot;
*Lined seahorse (&quot;Hippocampus erectus&quot;) Found all over the harbor and Sandy Hook. A species that should be gently put back exactly where it was found if caught, or as close to seagrass as possible. Numbers are threatened by collectors seeking Traditional Chinese Medicine. Should not be purchased at all from such vendors. 
*Mummichog (&quot;Fundulus heteroclitus&quot;)
*Northern pipefish (&quot;Syngnathus fuscus&quot;)
*Northern sea robin &quot;(Prionotus carolinus)&quot;
*Northern puffer (&quot;Sphoeroides maculatus)&quot; -A member of the blowfish family. Also known as a &quot;sugar toad.&quot; This is one of the only members of the blowfish family that is nowhere near as toxic as its Japanese and Chinese relatives. However, trying to catch this fish let alone eat it is dangerous as it can be mistaken for at least five other blowfish native to the Western Atlantic, two of which occasionally leave their normal ranges in warm weather and wind up in New York. Each of these lookalikes have an extremely deadly toxin in their flesh that humans cannot taste or smell. Techniques sushi chefs use on preparing fugu will not work with these fish since they are a different species with the poison in different parts and it is imperative that all New Yorkers and New Jerseyans know the source of the catch when eating in Asian restaurants, where immigrant owners might not be aware of the difference.
*Ocean sunfish &quot;(Mola mola)&quot; This fish can grow to gigantic sizes. May be found near entrance to Lower New York Bay. Very docile in spite of enormous size; it resembles a giant floating pancake with fins and will from time to time float near the surface.
*Oyster toadfish (&quot;Opsanus tau&quot;) Very commonly found haunting the piers and docks.
*Red hake (&quot;Urophycis chuss)&quot;
*Rough scad &quot;(Trachurus lathami)&quot;
*Sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes americanus&quot;). An important food source for harbor seals and grey seals as well as many baleen whales. Found in New York Bight as well as the estuary on the seabed. 
*Scup (&quot;Stenatomus chrysops&quot;)
*Shortnose sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser brevirostrum&quot;) Another dweller in the Hudson and East River. Smaller than its cousin the Atlantic sturgeon, though juveniles look similar. Should be put back where it was found if caught as it was placed on the Endangered Species List in 1967 and still is vulnerable. Spawning should occur around April.
*Silver hake &quot;(Merluccius bilinearis)&quot;
*Skillet fish (&quot;Gobiesox strumosus&quot;)
*Smallmouth flounder &quot;(Etropus microstomus)&quot;
*Striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;) - One of the most prevalent species in the harbor, and the most extensively fished one. The Hudson River Estuary system has been a nursery for stripers going back before European settlement and overall it is one of the most important breeding grounds for this species in the Northeast.
*Striped burrfish &quot;(Chilomycterus schoepfi)&quot; -A member of the blowfish family, but very different looking than any relative in the area owing to the spikes on its skin when it blows up. Hazardous to step on. Present in the harbor in late summer.
*Striped sea robin &quot;(Prionotus evolans)&quot;
*Striped mullet (&quot;Mugil cephalus)&quot;
*Summer flounder (&quot;Paralicthys dentatus&quot;)
*Tautog (&quot;Tautoga onitis&quot;) Locally known also as the &quot;blackfish&quot;. Attracted to artificial reefs and natural shoals in the estuary.
*Tomcod (&quot;Microgadus tomcod&quot;)
*Weakfish (&quot;Cynoscion regalis&quot;)
*White mullet &quot;(Mugil curema)&quot;
*White perch (&quot;Morone americana&quot;)
*Windowpane flounder &quot;(Scophthalmus aquosus)&quot;
*Winter flounder (&quot;Pleuronectes americanus&quot;)
*Yellowtail flounder (&quot;Limanda ferruginea&quot;)

====Elasmobranch Fish: Sharks, Skates, And Rays====

Despite popular belief, sharks are perfectly capable of living in the waters of the estuary as well as the deeper waters near Sandy Hook. This would include the very small species to the giants, with 25 of them being recorded as indigenous to the waters of New York State in total. They were once fairly common to the estuary, as evidenced by records left behind by the Dutch describing them in a way that is unmistakable for any other family of fish, and cousins of sharks like the skates and rays never totally went extinct in the waters off New York or New Jersey. Among the rays and sharks, there are many nomadic species that migrate.

The overwhelming majority of sharks have no interest in hunting humans, as there is plenty of prey available for them to hunt in the nearby waters. Larger species of shark prefer seals, dolphins, and large fish like tuna and billfish, which are found in the waters around the estuary. Most shark species are not known to prey on humans, with increased attacks occurring when natural prey is scarce. The New York Bight, the triangle of water with Montauk at one apex, the Jersey Shore at the second apex, and New York Harbor in the middle, is known for its abundance of marine life, thus providing a large amount of prey for sharks. The exact migration pattern is not completely known and currently being studied, but the general belief is that the larger pelagic sharks migrate north in the spring and return again to Florida and Georgia by the end of November as the water becomes too cold to be bearable. The waters in this area are also a haven for the larger species whose numbers are threatened as shark finning is forbidden by the State of New York.

*Basking shark &quot;(Cetorhinus maximus)&quot; Second largest species of shark in the world, but this shark is a filter feeder and not a predator. It can be mistaken for the great white owing to similar coloring, but has gill slits that slash almost around its whole head and has a front dorsal fin that is more triangular than the raked shape found in that of the great white.
*Blue shark &quot;Prionace glauca&quot; Not an aggressive species in particular with few records of attacks to its name, but a larger species. Can grow to ten feet long and has a slender build.
*Bull shark Historically responsible for an incident in Matawan, New Jersey in 1916 that inspired the film &quot;Jaws,&quot; this species is known to be more and aggressive than the larger great white, which cannot survive in fresh water. Bull sharks can swim up freshwater rivers and are present in the area from May–September.
*Great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;) One of the largest living species of shark that can grow to about 20 feet long, with average lengths of 15-16 ft. for females, and 11-13 for males. As of 2018, research indicates the return of this most feared shark. In 2016, scientists discovered what is thought to be a white shark nursery off Montauk, where a large number of juveniles indicates a nearby nursery. The great white can reach the other end of Long Island (Brooklyn and Queens) within a matter of 24 hours. Great whites are categorized as vulnerable and should not be hunted.
*Nurse shark (&quot;Ginglymostoma cirratum&quot;) Will occasionally visit artificial reefs.
*Sandbar shark (&quot;Carcharhinus plumbeus)&quot; Common near Sandy Hook. Growing presence nearer to New York City.
*Sand tiger shark (&quot;Carcharias taurus)&quot; New York Harbor is an important nursery for the babies.
*Scalloped hammerhead (&quot;Sphyrna lewini).&quot; Mature females grow to about 13 feet long. This species is rarely aggressive and mostly bites out of fear. The young of this species will form schools in estuaries. Babies are often caught in New York Harbor.
*Shortfin mako shark (&quot;Isurus oxyrinchus)&quot; May be dangerous to divers. Like the bull shark, they are ambush predators. The waters of the New York Bight and New York Harbor are naturally cloudy. This shark species is categorized as endangered and is threatened by shark finning and overfishing.

Rays

Cownose ray &quot;(Rhinoptera bonasus)&quot;

====Mammals====
All marine mammals are protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act of 1972.

*Bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;)
*Grey seal (&quot;Halichoerus gryphus&quot;) Can be distinguished from the harbor seal by its larger size, W-shaped nostrils, and preference to lay flopped out with its back flippers down when resting out of the water. Will rest on jetties.
*Harbor seal (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) - Historically both pinniped species were abundant natives in the harbor until hunting and other human activity extirpated them from the area by at least the late 19th century: there is a section of the harbor that was historically known as &quot;Robbins Reef. &quot; &quot;Robyn&quot; is the Dutch word for &quot;seal&quot;, proving their existence long before the American Revolution. In recent years, however, these two species, along with the some more typically northerly seal species like the harp seal have been found in the harbor in pursuit of some of the species mentioned above; others are yearlings who are continuing the trend on the U.S. East Coast of seals reclaiming former habitat, heading southward from mother populations in New England and Canada and from more easterly parts of Long Island. Colonies of harbor seals and greys are increasing their numbers with every passing year and will be seen in the area from December through April. Occasionally this species will swim upstream in the Hudson River.
*Harbor porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;) - Has been seen in Upper New York Bay.
*North American river otter (&quot;Lutra canadensis&quot;) - Native to the Hudson River and occasionally is seen at the mouth of the river. Restoration efforts by the state of New York are underway and appear to be successful.

Whales

All whales that visit the estuary are wild animals; many, like the humpback, may be mothers with calves. The water from their blowholes will usually be visible long before the rest of the body is. They will defend themselves vigorously and violently if they believe they or their babies are in danger. A recommended distance of at least 100 yards must be maintained between a vessel and the whale, and pursuing one when it does not seek contact is illegal. It is not unknown for some species to be inquisitive and should the whale approach willingly, the boatmen must turn off the engine and give the beast a way out so that if the whale feels uneasy, it can leave.

*Blue whale (&quot;Balaenoptera musculus&quot;) The largest of all whale species, and one of the rarest. Can be found just off Sandy Hook.
*Fin whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;) The second largest species of whale. Will enter the Upper Harbor and has been seen off Coney Island. This is the fastest swimming whale found in the estuary.
*Humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) Among whales, one of the most common visitors to the Harbor as of 2018. Records going back over 300 years are very clear that whales were present in the area in historical times and only disappeared after the water became saturated with the garbage of humans. Usually humpbacks appear in the harbor around April and will not leave until late October: New York City and its surrounding waters are dead in the middle of their migration route, a huge territory that begins in Newfoundland, runs through New England, passes into the waters of Florida and the American South, and terminates in a strait between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The estuary is an excellent pit stop for mother whales wanting to teach their calves how to catch the fish that have returned in numbers not seen in over a century. In 2017 one humpback whale made international news when it breached in front of a camera less than a few miles from Battery Park and raised awareness that whales have &quot;come home&quot; at last to New York.
*Minke whale (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;)
*North Atlantic right whale (&quot;Eubalaena glacialis&quot;) Extremely endangered. Less than 400 are left in the world. New York and New Jersey are in the center of its migration route between Florida and the Bay of Fundy in Canada. Great care must be taken around this species of whale as most cannot outswim jet propelled boats and are frequent victims of ship strikes. All sightings should be reported to authorities like the Coast Guard or NYPD at once, for every member of this species is precious to its continued survival.

From 2007-2009, an expert from Cornell University did an experiment listening in on the acoustics of the Harbor Estuary, where, to the astonishment of many, he discovered at least six species of whale vocalizing less than 20 miles from where the Statue of Liberty stands, just past the Verrazano Bridge where the water gets deeper. Historical records show that whales were plentiful in the area going well back into colonial history: in 1697, the charter for Trinity Church received its official royal charter, which gave it not only a large chunk of land in Lower Manhattan, but also the profit from any whales or shipwrecks along the banks of the Hudson. The return of these whales is evidence of the environment&#x27;s improvement over the past forty years: whales have been absent from New York&#x27;s waters west of the Hamptons for over a hundred years as the water became incredibly polluted and in 1989 the population was zero. In 2009, however, a young humpback whale attempted to penetrate the gateway to the upper harbor when it passed under the Verrazano Bridge, causing the men and women ashore watching the whole debacle from Fort Hamilton a great deal of alarm, concerned for its health and the safety of the Coast Guard officers trying to herd the frightened, massive creature back out to sea (the whale returned unharmed.) In late 2017, for the first time, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in partnership with the New York Aquarium began to count the whales in a census as the population has expanded mightily.

*Blue mussel (&quot;Mytulis edulis&quot;)
*Coquina (&quot;Donax fossor&quot;) A very small species that is found where the tide meets the sand.
*Eastern oyster (&quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;) - Once widely found through much of the harbor and a staple of the local diet from the time of the Algonquians up through the 19th century. Oystering grounds were prevalent in the Upper Bay, as well as along the south shore of Staten Island and Jamaica Bay. The oyster still exists in the harbor but is not yet considered edible; there are plans to further clean up the areas so that the beds can be restored.
*Quahog (&quot;Venus mercenaria&quot;)
*Steamer clam (&quot;Mya arenaria&quot;)

====Cephalopods====

====Gastropods====

* Common whelk (&quot;Buccinum undatum)&quot;
*Channeled whelk (&quot;Busycon canaliculatum&quot;)
*Common periwinkle (&quot;Littorina littorea&quot;) - Almost certainly introduced in colonial times by the British as food and possibly in bilgewater from ships. Common sight clinging to rocks or wherever their favorite algae can grow.
*Eastern mudsnail (&quot;Ilanassa obsoleta&quot;)

<doc id="473749" wikidata="Q7773723" url="?curid=473749" title="The Waterboys (album)">
<text>The Waterboys is the debut studio album by the Waterboys, released by Ensign Records in July 1983. The album was recorded in several studio sessions between December 1981 and November 1982. Allmusic describes the sound of the album as &quot;part Van Morrison, part U2&quot;.

The album cover is a photograph of lead singer Mike Scott by Panny Charrington and designed by Stephanie Nash. The Waterboys logo appears in the pale blue box in the upper right-hand corner of the original album cover (pale pink on 2002 reissue). The symbol, which symbolizes water, continued to be used throughout the band&#x27;s history. It was designed by Stephanie Nash of Island Records.

==Production history==
In 1981 Mike Scott was working in the punk rock band Funhouse, who had recently changed their name from Another Pretty Face. Signed to the record label Ensign Records, the group had moved to London to record their music. Scott had been unsatisfied with the group&#x27;s sound, which he described as &quot;similar to a jumbo jet flying on one engine&quot;, and in December 1981 decided to use Redshop Studio to record some of his own songs solo, after prompting from Ensign Records to consider a solo career. With the help of a drum machine, Scott sang, played the piano and guitar on each of five songs. Two recordings from this studio demo session would eventually make their way onto the first Waterboys album, &quot;December&quot; and &quot;The Three Day Man&quot;. The quality of the session convinced Scott to leave Funhouse. Scott made further series&#x27; of recordings on his own at Redshop in February, April and August 1982, which yielded the following tracks: &quot;Savage Earth Heart&quot;, &quot;It Should Have Been You&quot;, &quot;Gala&quot; and &quot;Where Are You Now When I Need You?&quot;.

In spite of his label&#x27;s advice, Scott instead began forming a new band to work with. In early 1982 he recruited Anthony Thistlethwaite for the new project, which became the Waterboys. Scott first heard Thistlethwaite on a Nikki Sudden album. Thistlethwaite brought in a friend of his, Kevin Wilkinson, as a drummer. Sudden describes the events as Scott &quot;stealing&quot; the two away, but notes that Scott could afford to pay Thistlethwaite and Wilkinson, whereas Sudden could not. Scott and Thistlethwaite recorded &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; in Spring of 1982, and with Wilkinson and bassist Nick Linden they recorded further new tracks in November 1982 at Redshop Studio, Islington, of which one, &quot;I Will Not Follow&quot;, appears on this album.

Ensign flew Scott to New York to record with Patti Smith&#x27;s guitarist, Lenny Kaye, as the producer. The recording session went poorly, and the material was not released in favour of recordings from the various London sessions. After two single releases of &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; in March 1983, &quot;The Waterboys&quot; was released that July.

A remastered version of the album with a number of extra tracks was released on 23 April 2002 by Capitol Records.

==Songs==
&quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; had been released both as a seven-inch and as a 12-inch single in March 1983, preceding the album by four months. The song, a tribute to Patti Smith, &quot;narrowly failed&quot; to become a hit. The B-side on the seven-inch was &quot;The Late Train to Heaven&quot;, the &quot;Rockfield mix&quot; of which was eventually released on a re-issue of &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;, the group&#x27;s next album. The twelve-inch contained &quot;Ready for the Monkey House&quot;, the Another Pretty Face song &quot;Out of Control&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Somebody Might Wave Back&quot;, the last of which would appear in a full studio version on &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;.

&quot;December&quot; was also released as a single (for the Christmas season) in both seven-inch and twelve-inch formats, with similar commercial results. The seven-inch&#x27;s B-side was &quot;Where are You Now When I Need You?&quot;, while the twelve-inch included an alternate recording of &quot;The Three Day Man&quot; and &quot;Red Army Blues&quot;, a song that would be included on &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;.

An extended live version of &quot;Savage Earth Heart&quot;, a song which had eventually become a &quot;live show stopper&quot; was re-released as a B-side on the single for &quot;Is She Conscious?&quot; from &quot;A Rock in the Weary Land&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, Neil Haverson of the &quot;Herts and Essex Observer&quot; considered the Waterboys to &quot;breathe new life into the stale and stagnant musical form [of] rock&quot; and called Scott &quot;a mixture of Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen&quot;. He described the album as &quot;deeply personal, from the religious discussion on &#x27;December&#x27;, the savage intensity of &#x27;I Will Not Follow&#x27; to the anger, damnation and finally hope on &#x27;Savage Earth Heart&#x27;&quot;. He concluded, &quot;The Waterboys have arrived like a tidal wave. Dive in and drown.&quot; Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; predicted Scott would achieve success in the future &quot;if the current trend for more passionate pop keeps up, for he mixes a blend of Sixties and Seventies influences with a welcome freshness and enthusiasm&quot;. He continued, &quot;With an impassioned voice and good piano work to help him, he should do well when he settles into a style more distinctively his own.&quot;
