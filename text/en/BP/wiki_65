<text>Dammam ( &quot;&quot;) is the capital of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf. With a population of 1,386,166 as of 2022, Dammam is the kingdom&#x27;s fifth-most populous city after Riyadh, Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. Dammam constitutes the core of the Dammam metropolitan area, also known as the Greater Dammam area, which comprises the &#x27;Triplet Cities&#x27; of Dammam, Dhahran, and Khobar. The region is closely linked to the city through social, economic, and cultural ties. the Dammam metropolitan area&#x27;s population was 2,743,318.

The area that eventually became Dammam was settled by the Dawasir tribe around 1923, with permission of King Ibn Saud. The area was originally a fishing hamlet. It developed after the discovery of oil in the region, becoming a port city and an administrative center. Following the unification of Saudi Arabia, Dammam was made the capital of the newly formed Eastern Province.

Dammam is known for being a major administrative center for the Saudi oil industry, contributing to the export volume of the city&#x27;s King Abdul Aziz Sea Port. With a cargo capacity of 2,038,787 TEUs as of 2022, the port is the second largest on the Persian Gulf, the third largest in Saudi Arabia, and eight largest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by cargo capacity.

The city and the rest of the Eastern Province are served by the King Fahd International Airport (KFIA), the largest airport in the world in terms of land area (approximately ), located about northwest of the city.

==History==
In 1866, the British attacked the fort of Dammam, which was under the control of the Emirate of Nejd. However, the attack failed.

=== Foundation (1923–1932) ===

Dammam was founded in 1923 by the Al Dawasir tribe that migrated from Bahrain after King Abdul Aziz allowed them to settle within the area. The tribe initially settled in Khobar, which was chosen for its proximity to the island of Bahrain as the tribe had hoped to go back there soon, but the British made it tough for them to maneuver. However, this gave the population of Khobar a lift, together with the formation of close ties with the larger city of Dammam.

=== Search for and discovery of oil (1932–1940s) ===
The planning of drilling wells in Dammam started in the spring of 1933 In Jeddah, when an oil concession agreement was signed by both the government of King Abd al-Aziz Al Saud and the representatives of The Standard Oil Company of California. A team of geologists was sent to Dammam. They finalized their plans for the wells in the beginning of June 1934. The work on the cellar for the first drilling rig in Dammam started approximately in January 1935, and ended on 19 February 1935. On 30 April 1935, the work began on drilling the firstst oil well in Dammam. When Dammam No. 1 didn&#x27;t produce promising result, the work on it stopped on 4 January 1936, and Dammam No. 2 was drilled. Because of the promising results, there were plans to drill 5 more wells in the surrounding area of Dammam No. 2. Between June and early September 1936, the production of all of these drills were monitored closely, and most of them were disappointing. On December 7, 1936, the work started on Dammam No. 7. At the beginning the drilling didn&#x27;t produce promising results. However, by 4 March 1938, Well No. 7 started producing a promising amount of oil. Saudi Aramco dug the famous Dammam Well No. 7, now designated the &#x27;Prosperity Well,&#x27; that proved that the kingdom possessed an oversized supply of hydrocarbons.

=== Phase of rapid growth (1940s–1960s) ===

The discovery of recent oil fields around Dammam within the 1940s and 50s, which now account for 25% of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves, triggered a construction boom. The Al Bin Ali family, led by Sheikh Muhammad bin Nasir Al Bin Ali and his brothers, played a vital role in the development of town and also the region in various fields. Their company, Al Bin Ali and Brothers, was the primary Saudi construction company that took part within the expansion of Aramco. a number of their projects were the roads connecting Dammam to the northern oil wells, Highway 40, which connected Dammam to Riyadh; now referred to simply as the Dammam Road, and multiple expansions of the King Abdul Aziz Port. This led to experts and technicians from in and round the kingdom gathering to assist in the hunt for new oil fields and bring them on-stream. New pipelines, storage facilities, and jetties were also constructed to handle tankers.

Service industries sprouted up to support the industry and meet the needs and requirements of individuals living within the newly founded metropolitan area. As it has in other parts of the dominion, the Ministry of Health has established several modern hospitals and a network of healthcare facilities within the Dammam Area. These are supplemented by hospitals and clinics operated by the private sector.

=== Modern history (1960s–present) ===
Within a few decades, a locality that had several hundred inhabitants some sixty years ago now boasts a population of more than 1.5 million, and is still growing at a sustained high rate. The Dammam area, unlike other oil towns, has developed in multiple fields. Including hosting the administration of the Saudi oil industry, it is also a contemporary urban and industrial center. As this sector was growing within the early years, the Saudi government took steps to facilitate the evolution of the area. New roads and highways connected the booming city to other urban and industrial centers within the Kingdom. A railway line connected Dammam to the agricultural center of Kharj and on to Riyadh. Dhahran International Airport was established to further enhance the region&#x27;s connection to other parts of the country and the world. Later, all commercial air transport facilities were transferred to the larger King Fahd International Airport, approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Dammam.

To encourage the expansion of non-oil industries, an industrial city was established within the open space between the three cities. Now home to 124 factories, the first Industrial City of Dammam was quickly surrounded by an urban mass. As a result, a second industrial city was established further far from the Dammam Area along Highway 615. Located on nearly of land, the second Industrial City is home to 120 factories, with 160 others under construction. These plants manufacture a range of products that are marketed throughout the kingdom and also exported to other countries. Handling such exports and other imports is carried out by several shipping agents and commercial companies spread throughout the area.

The Dammam Area was designed from the outset on the principles of contemporary urban planning. Residential areas are clearly separated from commercial ones, the roads are broad and straight and buildings conform to a plan. One of the most significant factors contributing to the growth of the area was land reclamation; vast stretches of the shallow Persian Gulf were reclaimed. Water is provided by desalination plants that pump approximately seven million cubic feet of treated water every day. The supply of water underpins the urban and industrial growth of the Dammam Area, being made for expanding existing desalination facilities to satisfy future growth. Dammam is a member city in the World Energy Cities Partnership (WECP).

===Environmental concerns===

There is evidence that several building foundations and underground infrastructures in Dammam have been structurally weakened by a rising water table. Various sources, including precipitation, seawater intrusion and leakage from underground water networks and sewage pipes, were anecdotally suspected to be contributors to the rising shallow water-table problem. A recent study by T. M. Iwalewa and others has revealed that leakages from drinking-water supply and sewage-collection pipe networks are the major contributors to the rise in the water table in the city. The study showed that the rising shallow water-table problem represents a serious threat to the present and future development of the city.

<doc id="479215" wikidata="Q3035737" url="?curid=479215" title="Don Boudria">
<text>Don Boudria (born August 30, 1949) is a former Canadian politician and current senior associate at Sandstone Group, an Ottawa-based executive advisory firm. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1984 to 2006 as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chrétien.

==Municipal and provincial politics==
Boudria was born in Hull, Quebec, and raised in Sarsfield, Ontario. Similarly, he was educated in the area and worked as a public servant before entering political life. A Franco-Ontarian, he was elected as councillor for Cumberland Township in 1976, and remained a council member until his election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1981 provincial election. Boudria defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Joseph Albert Bélanger by 5,172 votes in Prescott and Russell, and served in the legislature for three years as a member the Ontario Liberal Party, which was then the official opposition to the Progressive Conservative government, led by William Davis.

==Entry into federal politics==
He left provincial politics to run for the House of Commons in the 1984 federal election. Boudria won a convincing victory in Ontario&#x27;s easternmost riding, Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, even as his party suffered a landslide defeat against Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives. Joining the opposition benches of the Commons in 1984, he became a member of the Liberal Rat Pack with Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps and John Nunziata. This group of young Liberals made it their business to challenge the Tories at every possible chance. In his first federal term, Boudria successfully sponsored a motion to erect a statue of Canada&#x27;s only Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson.

==Re-election and cabinet positions==
Boudria was re-elected without difficulty in 1988, 1993, 1997 and 2000. Like the other Rat Pack members, he rose rapidly in the Liberal ranks. From 1991 to 1993, he served as Deputy Liberal House Leader. After the Liberals won a huge majority in 1993, Boudria returned temporarily to the back benches. He was appointed Chief Government Whip on September 15, 1994. He held this position until October 4, 1996, when he was named to Cabinet as Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for La Francophonie.

Boudria was named Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons after the 1997 election, managing a complex legislative agenda when, for the first time in Canadian history, five parties (Liberals, Reform, Bloc Québécois, New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives, in descending order of seat count) won enough seats to qualify for official party status. In 1998, he sponsored legislation to control third-party advertising during election campaigns strictly. This law was challenged all the way to the Supreme Court and sustained, remaining in place to this day. One of the main challengers of this legislation was the National Citizens Coalition.

He retained this position until January 14, 2002, when he was again given a full portfolio as Minister of Public Works and Government Services. He was reappointed as Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons on May 26, 2002, when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien retired.

===Chrétien loyalist===
Boudria was known within the Liberal caucus as a leading Chrétien loyalist. During Question Period, he frequently handed Chrétien notes from a white binder. Due to this practice, Reform Party deputy leader Deb Grey asked in 2000 if Chrétien could answer a question &quot;without any help from Binder Boy.&quot; The nickname stuck.

Boudria was not reappointed to cabinet in December 2003 when Paul Martin replaced Chrétien as Liberal leader and prime minister. However, he became chair of the Official Languages Committee, and after the 2004 federal election, became chair of the Procedure and House Affairs Committee. Subsequently, he was elected chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages (3rd session of the 37th parliament) and the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (1st session of the 38th parliament).

On May 6, 2005, Boudria announced he would not run in the next election.

==Life after government==
Boudria&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Busboy: From Kitchen to Cabinet&quot;, was published in late 2005. In 2006, he assisted Stéphane Dion&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Boudria joined Ottawa-based public relations agency Hill &amp; Knowlton Canada as a senior associate in May 2006, and was promoted to senior counsellor in March 2007. He continued with Hill &amp; Knowlton Canada up until June 2023, before beginning a new professional journey as senior associate at Sandstone Group.

Don&#x27;s son, Dan Boudria, was elected to the Conseil des écoles catholiques de langue française du Centre-Est in the 2006 municipal election. In early 2007, the Liberal Party of Canada Association of Glengarry—Prescott—Russell selected the younger Boudria as candidate in the 40th federal election. He lost to incumbent Conservative MP Pierre Lemieux.

==Accolades==
Boudria has been decorated on three separate occasions by the International Assembly of French-speaking Parliamentarians with the l’Ordre de la Pleiade award, where he served as the founding president of the Ontario section, for his advocacy of international cooperation and the rights of French-speaking peoples. He was also a recipient of the Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians&#x27; Distinguished Service Award in 2018.

The University of Ottawa has created an annual scholarship under his name to nurture Canadian history scholars.
The city of Ottawa has also established a Don Boudria Park in Orleans to recognize his many years of service to the region and to Canadians at large. It was opened in July 2020 and officially inaugurated by Jim Watson, the Mayor of Ottawa, in August 2021.

<text>Pasquale Villari (3 October 1827 – 11 December 1917) was an Italian historian and politician.

==Early life and publications==
Villari was born in Naples and took part in the risings of 1848 there against the Bourbons and subsequently fled to Florence. There he devoted himself to teaching and historical research in the public libraries with the object of collecting new materials on Girolamo Savonarola. He published the fruits of his research in the &quot;Archivio Storico Italiano&quot; in 1856, and in 1859 he published the first volume of his &quot;Storia di Girolamo Savonarola e de&#x27; suoi tempi&quot;, in consequence of which he was appointed professor of history at Pisa. A second volume appeared in 1861, and the work, which soon came to be recognized as an Italian classic, was translated into various foreign languages.

It was followed by a work of even greater critical value, &quot;Niccolò Machiavelli e i suoi tempi&quot; (1877–82). In the meanwhile Villari had left Pisa and was transferred to the chair of philosophy of history at the Institute of Studii Superiori in Florence, and he was also appointed a member of the council of education (1862). He served as a juror at the international exhibition of that year in London, and contributed an important monograph on education in England and Scotland.

==Enters politics==
In 1869 he was appointed under-secretary of state for education, and shortly afterwards was elected member of parliament, a position which he held for several years. In 1884 he was appointed senator, and became vice-president of the senate in 1887. In 1891-1892 he was minister of education in the Marchese di Rudini&#x27;s first cabinet, and introduced valuable reforms into the curriculum of the schools. In 1893-1894 he collected a number of essays on Florentine history, originally published in the Nuova Antologia, under the title of I primi due secoli della storia di Firenze, and in 1901 he produced &quot;Le Invasioni Barbariche in Italia&quot;, a popular account in one volume of the events following the dissolution of the Roman Empire.

==Other works==
Among his other literary works may be mentioned: &quot;Saggi Critici&quot; (1868); &quot;Arte, Storia, e Filosofia&quot; (Florence, 1884); &quot;Scritti varii&quot; (Bologna, 1894); another volume of &quot;Saggi Critici&quot; (Bologna, 1896); and a volume of &quot;Discussioni critiche e discorsi&quot; (Bologna, 1905), containing his speeches as president of the Dante Alighieri Society. His most important political and social essays are collected in his &quot;Lettere Meridionali ed altri scritti sulla questione sociale in Italia&quot; (Turin, 1885), and &quot;Scritti sulla questione sociale in Italia&quot; (Florence, 1902). &quot;The Lettere Meridionali&quot; (originally published in the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Opinione&quot; in 1875) produced a deep impression, as they were the first exposure of the real conditions of southern Italy. Many of his works were translated into English by his wife, Linda White Mazini Villari, with whom he had Luigi Villari. 

==Personal life==
His stepdaughter, Costanza, married the artist William Stokes Hulton. They had two daughters, Gioconda Mary Hulton and Edith Teresa Hulton. Edith Teresa Hulton became the 8th Lady Berwick of Attingham Park in Shropshire upon her marriage to Thomas Henry Noel-Hill, 8th Lord Berwick, in 1919.

== Family ==
His younger brother Emilio Villari became a physicist.

<text>All Saints is an Australian medical drama television series that first screened on the Seven Network on 24 February 1998. Set in the fictional All Saints Western General Hospital, it focused on the staff of Ward 17 until its closure in 2004, which is when the focus changed and began following the staff of the Emergency Department. The show was produced by John Holmes alongside Jo Porter, MaryAnne Carroll and Di Drew. The final episode aired on 27 October 2009, completing its record-breaking 12-year run.

== Plot ==
&quot;All Saints&quot; follows the lives of the staff at All Saints Western General Hospital. Until its closure in 2004 (season 7), the show primarily focused on the staff in Ward 17. Known as the &quot;garbage ward&quot; as it took all the overflow from the other wards, Ward 17 was run by compassionate nun, Sister Terri Sullivan (Georgie Parker). Her staff included her nurses Connor Costello (Jeremy Cumpston), Von Ryan (Judith McGrath), Bronwyn Craig (Libby Tanner), Jared Levine (Ben Tari) and Stephanie Markham (Kirrily White) and her ward clerk Jaz Hillerman (Sam Healy). Luke Forlano (Martin Lynes) and Peter Morrison (Andrew McKaige) were doctors who frequently worked with Terri and her staff. Ben Markham (Brian Vriends) was an ambulance officer who worked closely with Luke, despite their rivalry. Bronwyn left Ward 17 and became an ambulance officer at the end of 1998 but returned to the ward full-time at the end of season 3.

Peter and Jaz were written out early on in the second season which introduced Doctor Mitch Stevens (Erik Thomson, an old boyfriend of Terri&#x27;s with whom she had unfinished business. More of the original cast left: Stephanie was killed in a car accident in Season 3 and Connor left in Season 4. The beginning of the fourth season gave Ben a new ambulance partner, Scott Zinenko (Conrad Coleby), and the concluding episodes introduced two new nurses, Paula Morgan (Jenni Baird) and Nelson Curtis (Paul Tassone). Long-serving doctor Charlotte Beaumont (Tammy Macintosh) made her debut in the fifth season.

== Production ==
After the death of Dr. Mitch Stevens (Erik Thomson) and the departure of Bron Craig (Libby Tanner) in 2003, the producers decided to do something in response to considerable drop in ratings and to prolong the life of the series.

In February 2004, John Holmes told The Age journalist Debi Enker that &quot;All Saints&quot; would be undergoing &quot;major surgery&quot; when the focus shifted from Ward 17 to the Emergency Department. He also stated that while four familiar faces will be leaving, new characters will be introduced to fill the void. Holmes recalled a statement that he made in May 2003 in which he said, &quot;we [myself and Seven script executive Bevan Lee] were seeing the scripts and watching episodes and we were feeling that there was a little bit of a sameness in it. We started to think, &#x27;Don&#x27;t know about this. Sixth year. Maybe we&#x27;ve had a few too many people through the door of Ward 17 on a trolley and had the &#x27;Hi, I&#x27;m Von, I&#x27;m your nurse. Room Three, thanks Sterlo.&#x27;&quot; After tossing up between cancelling the show and using it as the foundation of a spin-off series, Holmes and Lee decided to rejuvenate the show by changing the setting. Ward 17 would then close and the show would be relocated to the Emergency Department.

As a result of the shift, several cast members decided to leave the show. Paula Morgan (Jenni Baird), Luke Forlano (Martin Lynes), Alex Kearns (Fletcher Humphrys) and Sterling McCormack (Henry Nixon) were all written out of the show. Former &quot;Always Greener&quot; star John Howard signed a three-year deal and was added to the cast as the cranky head of Emergency, Dr. Frank Campion. Other new faces included Wil Traval as Dr. Jack Quade, Mark Priestley and Natalie Saleeba as nurses Dan Goldman and Jessica Singleton and Alexandra Davies as ambulance officer Cate McMasters.

Season eight saw one of the biggest changes yet as Terri Sullivan (Georgie Parker), who until then had been the main character, was written out halfway through the year, leaving Von Ryan (Judith McGrath) as the last remaining original character and resulting in John Howard being moved into top billing. The last two episodes of the season introduced Chris Vance as doctor Sean Everleigh.

The ninth season would see another large cast turnover. Nelson and Jessica both left, while arriving were Allison Cratchley as doctor Zoe Gallagher, Andrew Supanz as intern Bartholomew West, Virginia Gay as new nurse unit manager Gabrielle Jaeger and Jolene Anderson as nurse Erica Templeton. John Waters appeared for a run of episodes as surgeon Mike Vlasek before returning full-time the following season. Season ten saw Vincent and Cate written out while Sean was killed off: His replacement was Steve Taylor (Jack Campbell), an old boyfriend of Gabrielle.

The eleventh season would see more comings and goings as Zoe departed mid-season. The latter part of the year saw Erica murdered off-screen, while the death of actor Mark Priestley resulted in Dan Goldman making his last appearance in the season&#x27;s penultimate episode, the same episode where Jack Quade departed. As a result, the final run of episodes introduced Kip Gamblin as doctor Adam Rossi and Ella Scott Lynch as nurse Claire Anderson. Alix Bidstrup, who had appeared for a run of episodes earlier in the year as Amy Fielding, Frank&#x27;s niece and a newly qualified nurse, returned as a regular.

In 2009 another attempt to stem the softening ratings and add a bit of excitement to the series, Seven Network executives decided to rejuvenate again, introducing a medical response unit to deal with tricky rescues which involved a helicopter going to remote locations to rescue patients who needed assistance. They would then bring those patients back to the ED and the staff there would assist in their treatment. Along with the addition of the new &quot;department&quot; the show was also renamed to &quot;All Saints: Medical Response Unit&quot;, the introduction of Mirrah Foulkes and the new MRU proved to lift the ratings substantially, but then levelled out at where they were prior to the revamp.

In June 2009, after months of rumours that the cancellation of &quot;All Saints&quot; was imminent, a spokeswoman from the Seven Network informed The Daily Telegraph that the episode order had been trimmed. Season twelve of &quot;All Saints&quot; would screen 24 episodes instead of the usual 40 episodes and that production would cease in August instead of November.

In July 2009, exactly one month later after the first announcement, Tim Worner, Seven&#x27;s Director of Programming at the time announced that &quot;All Saints&quot; had been cancelled. He told Michael Idato of the Sydney Morning Herald, &quot;&quot;All Saints&quot; is a show which Seven and viewers have loved. However, an audience shift and increased production costs are behind this tough decision.&quot; He also informed Idato that the episode order trim had been reverted and the season would complete a 37 episode order, finishing on episode 493. It was reported after the announcement that since the introduction of the MRU in 2009 it inflated the cost of each episode to $500,000. Many people still argue as to why the MRU was introduced in the first place or should have been removed instead of axing the show if the network was wanting to cut costs.

In the Feb/Mar 2010 GQ magazine in 2010, Tim Worner said his one regret was &quot;Axing All Saints. But it was the right call at the time and we have two new drama projects in development.&quot;

=== Controversy ===

==== Episode 265 ====
On 20 April 2004, episode 265, &quot;Brave New World&quot; aired, which saw the introduction of John Howard&#x27;s character, Frank Campion. It was also the first episode to be set in the Emergency Department. This episode attracted lots of controversy.

One patient came into the triage and tried to get help, but he was told to wait. Later on, Nelson heard a phone ring coming from the patient and asked him to turn off the phone. It was later hinted that he had been using the phone to masturbate and it had gotten stuck in his rectum.

The end of the episode saw Frank go introduce himself to Terri (Georgie Parker), who was recovering from heart surgery. During a heated argument about staff members, Frank blatantly said to Terri, &quot;if you ever use your influence with your previous employees to white-ant me again, you will never work in Emergency.&quot; Before Terri could get a word in, Frank added, &quot;can I make it any fucking clearer?&quot;

The next day, Channel Seven announced that they had received more than 100 phone calls in Melbourne alone. Parker told the media, &quot;it&#x27;s a good response because it&#x27;s not about the shock words—we&#x27;ve sworn on the show before—but because people clearly feel really protective about Terri. It&#x27;s like they really feel for her as a character and don&#x27;t like her being under attack by a very confronting man. It&#x27;s great to know they care for her so much.&quot;

On 22 April, the network issued a statement that read, &quot;within an M classification code, coarse language is permitted provided it is appropriate to the storyline or program context.&quot; An apology was not made.

====Episode 432====
On 27 May 2008, episode 432, &quot;Never Tell&quot; aired.

This episode saw a woman pregnant from an incestuous relationship with her brother, told her child may have Down syndrome as a result.

Leading geneticist Dr. David Amor of Murdoch Children&#x27;s Research Institute stated, &quot;There is absolutely no increase in the risk of Down syndrome for the offspring of incestuous relationships.&quot;

Down Syndrome Australia considered legal action, complained to the media regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and called for a boycott by the show&#x27;s advertisers if an apology and correction was not aired on &quot;All Saints&quot; the following week.

Seven responded with, &quot;&quot;All Saints&quot; values its audience and has the greatest respect for their commitment to the program. Without reservation, to any members of the audience who have found an element of a recent story offensive, Channel Seven apologises.&quot;

=== The final episode ===
The longer-than-usual 49-minute episode aired at 9:30pm on Tuesday, 27 October 2009. The episode, unlike those in the rest of the season, went back to basics and focused more on the lives of the nurses and doctors as they tended to patients.

The episode saw Judith McGrath&#x27;s character, Von Ryan tending to a teenage girl who comes into the ED and gives birth without knowing she was pregnant. Tammy Macintosh and John Howard finished their seven- and five-year reigns as Dr. Charlotte Beaumont and Dr. Frank Campion respectively, caring for a woman played by Heather Mitchell who had cystic fibrosis. Ella Scott Lynch and Jonathan Wood left the show on a high with their characters, Claire Anderson and Elliott Parker treating a man (Luke Pegler) with a disease consistent with diabetes and promiscuity.

Secretly, Von decides to resign from All Saints, telling only Frank that she wouldn&#x27;t be returning. He offers to take her out for dinner, but instead plans a surprise farewell dinner for her. Throughout the dinner, Gabrielle (Virginia Gay) and Steve (Jack Campbell) decide to raise their child together and get back together, Bart (Andrew Supanz) proposes to his girlfriend Amy (Alix Bidstrup) and Charlotte and Adam (Kip Gamblin) share an intense moment.

At the table, Von is pressured to make a speech by her colleagues and friends and reluctantly, she does, uttering her famous line: &quot;I spent a lot of time at All Saints and I&#x27;d just like to thank you all for your loyalty, your support and love. Oh bugger this, here&#x27;s to us.&quot; She raises her glass and toasts.

The finale is capped off by a montage of scenes from over the show&#x27;s twelve-year run, including Mitch&#x27;s final scene, the closure of Ward 17 and Bron &amp; Ben&#x27;s wedding, all to The Beatles song, &quot;In My Life&quot;.

The final scene sees Frank raise his glass at Von, who raises hers and smiles.

=== Opening credits ===

The first opening theme song for &quot;All Saints&quot; began with several deep breaths and then went into a tune played by a saxophone. The melody bears a striking similarity to &quot;Fly By Night&quot;, the first track on Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson&#x27;s 1983 debut album &quot;Walk Into Light&quot;. This played over the top of several shots of the cast members. Actors names were in the font Zurich Extra Condensed and underlined. Intercut were shots of hands, various medical equipment and medicine.

The second opening theme song was first used when the opening was upgraded in mid-season two. The same song was used however drums were added to give it more of an authentic sound. The shots of cast changed and names of actors and their characters were now present. The font remained the same. Shots of hands, medical vehicles and equipment were also present.

The first major overhaul of the opening happened in season four, when the titles were completely changed. They now began with several deep breaths over a blue screen with a vision of hands in the background. The screen was set up with a slide of the actor in the centre, with deep blue all around and medical notation. The theme was more stringy and only involved a small saxophone part. Medical crosses, bottles and syringes were present in the opening. This coincided with the change from the standard TV 4:3 aspect ratio to widescreen 16:9.

The second major overhaul of the opening happened in season seven, when the whole layout and font used were completely changed to mark the revamp of the show and its change of focus to the Emergency Department. The basic undertone of the theme was still there, however another saxophone overtone was added tho give the theme more authenticity. The images were also upgraded to include ambulances, surgical equipment and people rushing around in the background. The font changed and actors and characters were now in the font Imprint MT Shadow. This set of opening titles continues until the end of season eight.

At the beginning of season nine, the opening titles credits were ditched and the main cast were listed at the last of every episode with the names returning to their original format and font. This continues until the final episode. In seasons ten and eleven, the actor&#x27;s name and their corresponding character name flew in from either side, however this idea was dumped when the show returned for its final season.

An intertitle card appeared before every ad break in season nine, however the show returned to fading out in the tenth and eleventh seasons.

At the beginning of the eleventh season, a new title card premiered and this appeared at the start of every episode.

This title card was refurbished for the twelfth and final season to coincide with the change of name. This title card saw the show out.

<text>A congressional committee is a legislative sub-organization in the United States Congress that handles a specific duty (rather than the general duties of Congress). Committee membership enables members to develop specialized knowledge of the matters under their jurisdiction. As &quot;little legislatures&quot;, the committees monitor ongoing governmental operations, identify issues suitable for legislative review, gather and evaluate information, and recommend courses of action to their parent body. Woodrow Wilson once wrote, &quot;it is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at work.&quot; It is not expected that a member of Congress be an expert on all matters and subject areas that come before Congress. Congressional committees provide valuable informational services to Congress by investigating and reporting about specialized subjects.

Congress divides its legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks among approximately 200 committees and subcommittees. Within assigned areas, these functional subunits gather information; compare and evaluate legislative alternatives; identify policy problems and propose solutions; select, determine, and report measures for full chamber consideration; monitor executive branch performance (oversight); and investigate allegations of wrongdoing. The investigatory functions have always been a key role. In the tabling and wording of new law, procedures such as the House discharge petition process (the process of bringing a bill onto the floor without a committee report or mandatory consent from its leadership) are so laborious and technical that committees, today, dominate the draftsmanship and honing of the detail of many bills laid before Congress. Of the 73 discharge petitions submitted to the full House from 1995 through 2007, only one was successful in securing a definitive yea-or-nay vote for a bill.

The growth in autonomy and overlap of committees has fragmented the power of the Senate and of the House. This dispersion of power may, at times, weaken the legislative branch relative to the other two branches of the federal government, the executive and the judiciary. In his often cited article &quot;History of the House of Representatives&quot;, written in 1961, American scholar George B. Galloway (1898–1967) wrote: &quot;In practice, Congress functions not as a unified institution, but as a collection of semi-autonomous committees that seldom act in unison.&quot; Galloway went on to cite committee autonomy as a factor interfering with the adoption of a coherent legislative program. Such autonomy remains a characteristic feature of the committee system in Congress today.

==History==

In 1932, a reform movement temporarily reduced the number of signatures required on discharge petitions in the U.S. House of Representatives from a constitutional majority of 218 down to 145, i.e., from one-half to one-third of the House membership. This reform was abolished in a 1935 counterattack led by the intra-House oligarchy. Thus the era of the Great Depression marks the last across-the-board change, albeit a short-lived one, in the autonomy of House standing committees.

The modern committee structure stems from the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the first and most ambitious restructuring of the standing committee system since the committee system was first developed. The 1946 act reduced the number of House committees from 48 to 19 and the number of Senate committees from 33 to 15. Jurisdictions of all committees were codified by rule in their respective chambers, which helped consolidate or eliminate many existing committees and minimize jurisdictional conflicts.

The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, a temporary committee established in 1993 to conduct a policy and historical analysis of the committee system, determined that while the 1946 Act was instrumental in streamlining the committee system, it did fail to limit the number of subcommittees allowed on any one committee. Today, Rules in the U.S. House of Representatives generally limit each full committee to five subcommittees, with the exception of Appropriations (12 subcommittees), Armed Services (7), Foreign Affairs (7), and Transportation and Infrastructure (6). There are no limits on the number of subcommittees in the U.S. Senate.

Congress has convened several other temporary review committees to analyze and make recommendations on ways to reform and improve the committee system. For example, the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 led to further reforms to open Congress to further public visibility, strengthen its decision-making capacities, and augment minority rights. The 1970 Act provided for recorded teller votes in the House&#x27;s Committee of the Whole; allowed minority party committee members to call their own witnesses during a day of hearings; established the Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs; and enhanced the research capabilities of two legislative support agencies: the Congressional Research Service and the General Accounting Office.

Between 1994 and 2014, overall committee staffing was reduced by 35 percent. The number of hearings held in the House declined from 6,000 hearings per year in the 1970s, to about 4,000 hearings in 1994, and to just over 2,000 hearings in 2014. Commentators from both major parties have expressed concern regarding the loss of committee capacity to research and develop legislative initiatives.

===Senate committees===
The first Senate committee was established April 7, 1789, to draw up Senate rules of procedure. In those early days, the Senate operated with temporary select committees, which were responsive to the entire Senate, with the full Senate selecting their jurisdiction and membership. This system provided a great deal of flexibility, as if one committee proved unresponsive, another could be established in its place. The Senate could also forgo committee referral for actions on legislation or presidential nominations. These early committees generally consisted of three members for routine business and five members for more important issues. The largest committee established during the 1st Congress had eleven members, and was created to determine salaries of the president and vice president. Also in the first session, the entire membership of the Senate was divided into two large committees, with half the senators on the committee to prepare legislation establishing the federal judiciary and the other half on the committee to define the punishment of crimes against the United States.

This system proved ineffective, so in 1816 the Senate adopted a formal system of 11 standing committees with five members each. Three of those committees, the Finance, Foreign Relations and the Judiciary Committees exist largely unchanged today, while the duties of the others have evolved into successor committees. With the advent of this new system, committees are able to handle long-term studies and investigations, in addition to regular legislative duties. According to the Senate Historical Office, &quot;the significance of the change from temporary to permanent committees was perhaps little realized at the time.&quot; With the growing responsibilities of the Senate, the committees gradually grew to be the key policy-making bodies of the Senate, instead of merely technical aids to the chamber.
By 1906, the Senate maintained 66 standing and select committees—eight more committees than members of the majority party. The large number of committees and the manner of assigning their chairmanships suggests that many of them existed solely to provide office space in those days before the Senate acquired its first permanent office building, the Russell Senate Office Building. There were so many committees that freshman Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin was assigned chairmanship of the Committee to Investigate the Condition of the Potomac River Front at Washington. According to La Follette, he &quot;had immediate visions of cleaning up the whole Potomac River front. Then [he] found that in all its history, the committee had never had a bill referred to it for consideration, and had never held a meeting.&quot; In 1920, the Congressional Directory listed nearly 80 committees, including the Committee on the Disposition of Useless Papers in the Executive Departments. By May 27, 1920, the Russell Senate Office Building had opened, and with all Senate members assigned private office space, the Senate quietly abolished 42 committees.

Today the Senate operates with 21 committees (16 standing and 5 select). These select committees, however, are permanent in nature and are treated as standing committees under Senate rules.

===House committees===

The first House committee was appointed on April 2, 1789, to &quot;prepare and report such standing rules and orders of proceeding&quot; as well as the duties of a Sergeant-at-Arms to enforce those rules. Other committees were created as needed, on a temporary basis, to review specific issues for the full House. The House relied primarily on the Committee of the Whole to handle the bulk of legislative issues. In response to the House&#x27;s need for more detailed advice on certain issues, more specific committees with broader authority were established. One of the first—a three-member committee &quot;to prepare and report an estimate of supplies ... and of nett [sic] produce of the impost&quot;—was established on April 29, 1789. The Committee on Ways and Means followed on July 24, 1789, during a debate on the creation of the Treasury Department over concerns of giving the new department too much authority over revenue proposals. The House felt it would be better equipped if it established a committee to handle the matter. This first Committee on Ways and Means had 11 members and existed for just two months. It later became a standing committee in 1801, a position it still holds today.

===Committee assignment procedure===
The appointment of Senate committee members is formally made by the whole Senate, and the whole House formally appoints House committee members, but the choice of members is actually made by the political parties. Generally, each party honors the preferences of individual members, giving priority on the basis of seniority.

In the Senate, each party is allocated seats on committees generally in proportion to its overall strength in the Senate as a whole. Membership on most House committees are also in rough proportion to the party&#x27;s strength in the House as a whole, with two major exceptions: on the House Rules Committee, the majority party fills nine of the thirteen seats; and on the House Ethics Committee, each party has an equal number of seats.

In each committee, a member of the majority party serves as its chairperson, while a member of the minority party serves as its ranking member. Four Senate committees instead refer to the ranking minority member as vice chairperson: the Senate Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The chairpersons and ranking members in each committee are also elected by the political parties.

An analysis of U.S. House of Representative committee request letters from the 92nd, 93rd, 97th, 98th, 100th, and 101st Congresses showed that the most common justifications raised by members seeking a committee assignment were prior professional experience, geography, and electoral considerations, in that order. About 80 percent of justifications in the letters fell into one of these three categories. Members who request an assignment to the House Armed Services Committee tend to have a greater military presence in their district, while members requesting assignment to the House Interior Committee generally tend to come from sparsely populated areas with more land held in public trust.

==Types of committees==
There are three main types of committees—standing, select or special, and joint.

===Standing committees===

Standing committees are permanent panels identified as such in chamber rules (House Rule X, Senate Rule XXV).
Because they have legislative jurisdiction, standing committees consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration by their respective chambers. They also have oversight responsibility to monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions, and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions.

Most standing committees recommend funding levels—authorizations—for government operations and for new and existing programs. A few have other functions. For example, the Appropriations Committees recommend appropriations legislation to provide budget authority for federal agencies and programs. The Budget Committees establish aggregate levels for total spending and revenue that serve as guidelines for the work of the authorizing and appropriating panels.

===Select or special committees===

Select or special committees are established generally by a separate resolution of the chamber, sometimes to conduct investigations and studies, and, on other occasions, also to consider measures. Often, select committees examine emerging issues that do not fit clearly within existing standing committee jurisdictions, or that cut across jurisdictional boundaries. A select committee may be permanent or temporary (all current select committees in the House and Senate are considered permanent committees). Instead of select, the Senate sometimes uses the term special committee (as in the Special Committee on Aging).

===Joint committees===
Joint committees are permanent panels that include members from both chambers, which generally conduct studies or perform housekeeping tasks rather than consider measures. For instance, the Joint Committee on Printing oversees the functions of the Government Printing Office and general printing procedures of the federal government. The chairmanship of joint committees usually alternates between the House and Senate.

 four joint committees: the Economic, Library, Printing, and Taxation committees.

A conference committee is an ad hoc joint committee formed to resolve differences between similar but competing House and Senate versions of a bill. Conference committees draft compromises between the positions of the two chambers, which are then submitted to the full House and Senate for approval.

Apart from conference committees, most joint committees are permanent. But temporary joint committees have been created to address specific issues (such as the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War during the American Civil War, and a Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to manage presidential and vice-presidential inaugurations).

===Other===

Other committees are also used in the modern Congress.
* Subcommittees are formed by most committees to share specific tasks within the jurisdiction of the full committee. Subcommittees are responsible to, and work within the guidelines established by, their parent committees. In particular, standing committees usually create subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to consider and report bills. They may assign their subcommittees such specific tasks as the initial consideration of measures and oversight of laws and programs in the subcommittees&#x27; areas.
* Committee of the Whole—used by the House of Representatives, but not the modern Senate

==Current committees==
In the House of Representatives, there are 20 permanent committees, and 21 in the United States Senate. Four joint committees operate with members from both houses on matters of mutual jurisdiction and oversight.

Committees in the House of Representatives generally have more members, due to its larger size, as compared to the smaller 100-member Senate. Senate rules fix the maximum size for many of its committees, while the House determines the size and makeup of each committee every new Congress.

<text>Mary Higgins Clark (born Mary Theresa Eleanor Higgins; December 24, 1927 – January 31, 2020) was an American author of suspense novels. Each of her 51 books was a bestseller in the United States and various European countries, and all of her novels remained in print , with her debut suspense novel, &quot;Where Are the Children?&quot;, in its 75th printing.

Higgins Clark began writing at an early age. After several years working as a secretary and copy editor, she spent a year as a stewardess for Pan-American Airlines before leaving to marry and start a family. She supplemented the family&#x27;s income by writing short stories. After her husband died in 1964, Higgins Clark worked for many years writing four-minute radio scripts until her agent persuaded her to try writing novels. Her debut novel, a fictionalized account of the life of George Washington, did not sell well, and she decided to exploit her love of mystery/suspense novels. Her suspense novels became very popular, and have sold more than 100 million copies in the United States alone. Her former daughter-in-law Mary Jane Clark is also a writer, as was her daughter Carol Higgins Clark.

==Early life==

Mary Theresa Eleanor Higgins was born on Christmas Eve 1927 ( some sources mistakenly cite 1929 as the year). She was the second child and only daughter of Nora C. (Durkin) and Luke Joseph Higgins. Her father was an Irish immigrant, and her mother was American-born, also of Irish descent. The United States census gives her age in April 1940 as 12, which indicates her year of birth is 1927, as that was her age at her &quot;last birthday&quot;, the question asked by census enumerators.

She was born about a year and a half after the birth of her older brother, Joseph. Her younger brother John, followed three years later. Even as a small child, she was interested in writing; she composed her first poem at age seven and often crafted short plays for her friends to enact. She began keeping a journal when she was seven years old, noting in her first entry, &quot;Nothing much happened today.&quot;

The family lived off the earnings from their Irish pub and were fairly well-off, owning a home in the Bronx and a summer cottage on Long Island Sound. Although the Great Depression began when Higgins Clark was still a baby, her family was initially not affected and even insisted on feeding the men who knocked on their door looking for work. By the time Higgins Clark was ten, however, the family began to experience financial trouble, as many of their customers were unable to pay the bar tabs they had run up. Higgins Clark&#x27;s father was forced to lay off several employees and work longer hours, spending no more than a few hours at home each day. The family was thrown into further turmoil in 1939, when young Mary returned home from an early Mass to discover that her father had died in his sleep.

Nora Higgins, now a widow with three young children to support, soon discovered that few employers were willing to hire a 52-year-old woman who had not held a job in over fourteen years. To pay the bills, Higgins Clark was forced to move out of her bedroom so that her mother could rent it out to paying boarders. Six months after their father&#x27;s death, Higgins Clark&#x27;s older brother cut his foot on a piece of metal and contracted severe osteomyelitis. Higgins Clark and her mother prayed constantly for him, and their neighbors came en masse to give blood for the many transfusions the young boy needed. Despite the dire predictions of the doctors, Joseph Higgins survived. Higgins Clark credited his recovery to the power of their prayers.

When Higgins Clark graduated from Saint Francis Xavier Grammar School, she received a scholarship to continue her education at the Villa Maria Academy, a school run by the nuns of the Congregation de Notre Dame de Montreal. There, the principal and other teachers encouraged Higgins Clark to develop her writing, although they were somewhat less than pleased when she began spending her class time writing stories instead of paying attention to the lesson. At sixteen, Higgins Clark made her first attempt at publishing her work, sending an entry to &quot;True Confessions,&quot; which was rejected.

To help pay the bills, she worked as a switchboard operator at the Shelton Hotel, where she often listened in to the residents&#x27; conversations. In her memoir she recalls spending much time eavesdropping on Tennessee Williams but complained that he never said anything interesting. On her days off, Higgins Clark would window shop, mentally choosing the clothes she would wear when she finally became a famous writer.

Despite Higgins Clark&#x27;s contribution to the family finances, the money her mother earned babysitting was not enough, and the family lost their house and moved into a small three-room apartment. When Joseph graduated from high school in 1944, he immediately enlisted in the Navy, both to serve his country during war and to help his mother pay her bills. Six months after his enlistment he contracted spinal meningitis and died. Although the family mourned Joseph&#x27;s death deeply, as his dependent, Nora was guaranteed a life pension and no longer needed her daughter&#x27;s help to pay the bills.

==Early career==
Soon after Joseph died, Higgins Clark graduated from high school and attended Wood Secretarial School on a partial scholarship. After completing her coursework the following year, she accepted a job as the secretary to the head of the creative department in the internal advertising division at Remington Rand. She soon enrolled in evening classes to learn more about advertising and promotion. Her growing skills, as well as her natural beauty, were noticed by her boss and others in the company, and her job was expanded to include writing catalog copy (alongside future novelist Joseph Heller) and to model for the company brochures with a then unknown Grace Kelly.

Although she enjoyed her job, Higgins Clark&#x27;s imagination was sparked by an acquaintance&#x27;s casual comment, &quot;God, it was beastly hot in Calcutta.&quot; Inspired to become a flight attendant like her acquaintance, Higgins Clark underwent rigorous interviews to earn a position as a flight attendant (then known as stewardess) for Pan American Airlines, making five dollars less a week than in her secretarial job. Her supervisor at Remington Rand hosted a goodbye dinner for her, and Higgins Clark invited her neighbor, Warren Clark, whom she had admired for years, to be her date. By the end of the evening Warren Clark had informed her that he thought she should work as a stewardess for a year, and then they should be married the following Christmas. Higgins Clark accepted the somewhat unorthodox proposal.

For most of 1949, she worked the Pan Am international flights, traveling through Europe, Africa, and Asia. One of her flights became the last flight allowed into Czechoslovakia before the Iron Curtain fell. On another of her flights, Higgins Clark escorted a four-year-old orphan down the steps of the airplane into the waiting arms of her adoptive mother, a scene that was heavily televised.

At the end of her year of flying, on December 26, 1949, Higgins Clark happily gave up her career to marry Warren Clark. To occupy herself, she began taking writing courses at NYU and, with some of her classmates, formed a writing workshop in which the members would critique each other&#x27;s works-in-progress. The workshop, which persisted for almost forty years, met weekly. At each meeting two members would have twenty minutes each to present their latest work. The other members would then have three minutes each to offer constructive criticism.

One of her professors at NYU told the class they should develop plot ideas by reading newspapers and asking themselves prompts such as, &quot;Suppose...?&quot; and &quot;What if...?&quot; She has said that she still gets many of her ideas by utilizing said prompts, along with &quot;Why?&quot;. For her first NYU writing assignment she used this method to expand her own experiences into a short story called &quot;Stowaway&quot; about a stewardess who finds a stowaway from Czechoslovakia on her plane. Although her professor offered high praise for the story, Higgins Clark was continually frustrated in her attempts to find a publisher. Finally, in 1956, after six years and forty rejections, &quot;Extension Magazine&quot; agreed to purchase the story for $100.

While those six years were devoid of professional milestones, on a personal level Higgins Clark and her husband were very busy. Their first child, Marilyn, was born nine months after their wedding, with Warren Jr. arriving thirteen months later. A third child, David, was born two years after his brother. Two months after Higgins Clark&#x27;s short story sold, the fourth baby made her appearance and was promptly named Carol, after the heroine in her mother&#x27;s story. After selling that first short story, Higgins Clark began regularly finding homes for her works. Through the writer&#x27;s workshop she met an agent, Patricia Schartle Myrer, who represented Higgins Clark for twenty years until her retirement. They became such good friends that Higgins Clark named her fifth and last child for her. While Warren worked and Higgins Clark wrote, they encouraged their children to find ways to earn money as well, with all five children eventually taking professional acting and modeling jobs. Young Patty served as a Gerber Baby, while David was featured in a national United Way ad. Higgins Clark herself filmed a television commercial for Fab laundry detergent. The commercial, which aired during the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; show, earned her enough money that she and Warren were able to take a trip to Hawaii.

In 1959, Warren Clark was diagnosed with severe angina, and, although he curtailed his activities on his doctor&#x27;s order, he suffered within the next five years, each time returning from the hospital in poorer health. After the last heart attack in 1964, they felt that Warren would be unable to work again, so Higgins Clark called a friend who wrote scripts for radio shows to see if there were any job openings. The day that she accepted a job writing the radio segment &quot;Portrait of a Patriot,&quot; Warren suffered a fatal heart attack. His mother, who was visiting at the time, collapsed dead at his bedside upon discovering that he had died. In one night, Higgins Clark lost both her husband and her mother-in-law.

==&quot;Aspire to the Heavens&quot;==
Higgins Clark&#x27;s initial contract to be a radio scriptwriter obligated her to write 65 four-minute programs for the &quot;Portrait of a Patriot&quot; series. Her work was good enough that she was soon asked to write two other radio series. This experience of fitting an entire sketch into four minutes taught Higgins Clark how to write cleanly and succinctly, traits that are incredibly important to a suspense novel, which must advance the plot with every paragraph. Despite the security offered by her new job, money was tight in the beginning as she strove to raise five children aged five to thirteen alone. For their first Christmas without Warren, Higgins Clark&#x27;s only gifts to her children were personalized poems describing the things she wished she could have purchased for them.

By the late 1960s, the short story market had collapsed. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which in 1960 named Higgins Clark&#x27;s short story &quot;Beauty Contest at Buckingham&quot; one of their ten best of the year, was in serious financial straits and had decided to stop publishing fiction, and many of the popular women&#x27;s magazines were also dropping or cutting back on fiction, focusing on self-help articles instead. Because her short stories were no longer able to find a publisher, Higgins Clark&#x27;s agent suggested that she try writing a full-length novel. Using her research and experience with the &quot;Portraits of a Patriot&quot; series, Higgins Clark spent the next three years writing a fictionalized account of the relationship between George and Martha Washington, &quot;Aspire to the Heavens&quot;. It is about George Washington and the love for his house. Although it was sold for only a small advance, its acceptance gave Higgins Clark confidence that she could indeed finish a full-length book and find a publisher. The novel &quot;was remaindered as it came off the press,&quot; and, to make matters worse, four months after the publication of the novel, Mary&#x27;s mother, Nora, died.

To ensure that her children would not have to struggle financially, Higgins Clark was determined that they should have good educations. To provide a good example she entered Fordham University at Lincoln Center in 1971, graduating summa cum laude in 1979, with a BA in philosophy. Her children followed her example. The two eldest, Marilyn and Warren, have become judges, and Patty works at the Mercantile Exchange in New York City. David is the president and CEO of Talk Marketing Enterprises, Inc, and Carol has authored many popular suspense novels.

During this time Higgins Clark became increasingly frustrated with her employer, and, although two of her children were partially dependent on her for their college tuition, she quit her job and joined two of her former colleagues in forming their own company to write and market radio scripts. To scrape up the $5000 she needed to start the business, Higgins Clark was forced to pawn her engagement ring, and, for the eight months it took the company to become profitable, she did not receive a salary, further straining the family finances.

Higgins Clark continued writing even during these hard times.

==Suspense genre==
Encouraged by her agent to try writing another book, Higgins Clark returned to the suspense stories that she loved as a child, which had provided her first success as a short story writer. While she was in the midst of writing the story, her younger brother Johnny died, leaving her the sole surviving member of her family. To temporarily forget her heartache, Higgins Clark threw herself into her writing, and soon finished the novel. Very quickly after the novel, &quot;Where are the Children?&quot; was completed, Simon &amp; Schuster agreed to purchase it for the relatively small sum of $3000. Three months later, in July 1974, Higgins Clark received word that the paperback rights for the novel had sold for one hundred thousand dollars. For the first time in many years, she had no immediate financial worries. &quot;Where Are the Children?&quot; became a bestseller and was favorably reviewed. Two years after its publication Higgins Clark sold her second suspense novel for $1.5 million.

Since 2010, Paris-based La Sabotière have been producing a series of her crime novels as television films. Mary Higgins Clark crime novel anthology series was placed into development in October 2019 under a partnership between Montreal-based Reel One Entertainment, U.S. producer Element 8 Entertainment and La Sabotière. The first season is slated to be based on &quot;I’ll Be Seeing You&quot; and, attached as writer and executive producer is Ilene Rosenzweig.

==Other writings==
Higgins Clark&#x27;s debut novel about George Washington, &quot;Aspire to the Heavens&quot; was retitled &quot;Mount Vernon Love Story&quot; and rereleased in 2002, the same year as her autobiography, &quot;Kitchen Privileges&quot;, which relied heavily on the journals she kept all of her life. In 2006, she announced that she would be fulfilling one of her dreams by publishing her first children&#x27;s book. &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; was published by Simon &amp; Schuster, who have published her suspense novels.

She wrote several Christmas-themed mystery novels with her daughter, Carol. Although popular with readers, some critics have complained that the books are of lesser quality because the tone is much lighter than her solo output. 

==Later life==
Higgins Clark dated throughout her widowhood. She described her second marriage (1978–1986) to Raymond Ploetz as &quot;disastrous&quot; and had it annulled.

In 1996, she married John J. Conheeney after they were introduced by her daughter, Patty. Conheeney died at age 89 on October 8, 2018. He was the retired CEO of Merrill Lynch Futures. The couple lived in Saddle River, New Jersey. (Higgins Clark first moved to New Jersey in 1956 when she and her first husband bought a home in Washington Township, Bergen County, New Jersey.)

In 1981, Higgins Clark happened to be in Washington, D.C., the day President Ronald Reagan was shot. Because she had a press pass she was able to join the media waiting to hear the President&#x27;s prognosis. When the doctor finally arrived to start the press conference, Higgins Clark was one of the few people chosen to ask a question.

In 2011, she served as the Grand Marshal of the New York City St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade.

In addition to her residence in Saddle River, Higgins Clark owned homes in Manhattan, Dennis, Massachusetts, and Naples, Florida. She died in Naples on January 31, 2020, at the age of 92.

==Success==
===Popular reception===

Higgins Clark had over 50 novels published, with millions of copies sold throughout the United States.

In 2001, the hardcover edition of Higgins Clark&#x27;s &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; was Number One on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Hardcover Bestseller list at the same time that the paperback version of her novel &quot;&quot; reached Number One on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Paperback Bestseller list.

Her books have been bestsellers in France, and have earned her the distinction of being named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France in 2000. She has been honored in France with the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière (1980) and the Deauville Film Festival Literary Award (1999). She was awarded the AIHS Gold Medal from the American Irish Historical Society, which is awarded to an Irish-American or Irish-national of significant accomplishment.

Many of the books deal with crimes involving children or with telepathy.

While Higgins Clark was aware that many people claiming to be psychics behave fraudulently, she believed that she had met people with genuine ESP powers. Nora Higgins, on looking at a photo of her eighteen-year-old son in his brand new Navy dress blues told Mary that &quot;He has death in his eyes&quot;, and the young man died shortly after. A psychic that Higgins Clark visited just as her second novel, &quot;Where Are the Children&quot;, was being published in paperback told her that she would become very famous and make a great deal of money. Although at the time she laughed off the prediction, the following week her novel reached the bestseller lists and she sold the movie rights shortly after, truly launching her career.

===Critical reception===
Higgins Clark won numerous awards for her writing. In addition to those previously referenced, she won the Horatio Alger Award (1997) and the Passionists&#x27; Ethics in Literature Award (2002), as well as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University Spirit of Achievement Award (1994) and the National Arts Club&#x27;s Gold Medal in Education (1994). She was awarded eighteen honorary doctorates, including one from her alma mater, Fordham University. Her success was also recognized by groups representing her heritage. The American Irish Historical Society granted her the Gold Medal of Honor in 1993, and in 2001 she won the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. She was named a Bronx Legend (1999).

Mary Higgins Clark served as the chairman of the International Crime Congress in 1988 and was the 1987 president of the Mystery Writers of America. For many years she served on the board of directors of the Mystery Writers of America. Simon &amp; Schuster, which have published all of Higgins Clark&#x27;s novels and in the late 1990s signed her to a $64-million, four-book contract, have funded the Mary Higgins Clark Award, given by the Mystery Writers of America to authors of suspense fiction. The announcement that an award would be given in her honor was made at the 55th Annual Edgar Allan Poe Awards, where Higgins Clark was inducted as a Grand Master.

Higgins Clark was made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and was honored as a Dame of Malta and a Dame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. The Franciscan Friars gave her a Graymoor Award (1999) and she was awarded a Christopher Life Achievement Award. She served as a board member for the Catholic Communal Fund and as a member of the board of governors at Hackensack Hospital.

Higgins Clark was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame in March 2011.

<text>Philip Alexius László de Lombos (born Fülöp Laub; ; 30 April 1869 – 22 November 1937), known professionally as Philip de László, was an Anglo-Hungarian painter known particularly for his portraits of royal and aristocratic personages. In 1900, he married the Anglo-Irish socialite Lucy Guinness, and he became a British subject in 1914. László&#x27;s patrons awarded him numerous honours and medals. He was invested with the Royal Victorian Order by Edward VII in 1909 and, in 1912, he was ennobled by Franz Joseph I of Austria; becoming a part of the Hungarian nobility.

==Early life==
László was born in seemingly humble circumstances in Pest (part of Budapest) as Fülöp Laub, the eldest son of Adolf and Johanna Laub, a tailor and seamstress of Jewish origin. Fülöp and his younger brother Marczi changed their surname to László in 1891.

He was apprenticed at an early age to a photographer while studying art, eventually earning a place at the National Academy of Art, where he studied under Bertalan Székely and Károly Lotz. He followed this with studies in Munich and Paris. László&#x27;s portrait of Pope Leo XIII earned him a Grand Gold Medal at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900. In 1903, László moved from Budapest to Vienna. In 1907, he moved to England and remained based in London for the remainder of his life, although endlessly travelling the world to fulfil commissions.

==Personal life==

In 1900, László married Lucy Madeleine Guinness, a member of the banking branch of the Guinness family and a sister of Henry Guinness. They had first met in Munich in 1892, but for some years had been forbidden to see each other. The couple had six children and 17 grandchildren.

László became interested in Catholicism as a young man, probably through his friendship with the Valentins, an elderly Bavarian couple. He was baptised into the Catholic Church in 1894 ... &quot;he never worshipped regularly but read the Bible and was a firm believer in God and the Christian story&quot;. His faith was especially strengthened by his visit to the Vatican in 1900, where he met and painted the aging Pope Leo XIII. László converted to Anglicanism upon his marriage, and his children were raised as Protestants. At a lecture to the Fisher Society in 1934, he said &quot;I believe that to worship nature is a religious duty. I see in nature the fullest revelation of the Divinity, and my faith is that only by acceptance of this revelation and by striving to realise it in all its perfection can I prove my worship to be sincere&quot;.

==Later life==

László&#x27;s patrons awarded him numerous honours and medals. In July 1909, he was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) by Edward VII. In 1912, he was ennobled by King Franz Joseph of Hungary; his surname then became &quot;László de Lombos&quot;, but he soon was using the name &quot;de László&quot;.

Despite his British citizenship, his marriage and five British citizen sons, de László was interned for over twelve months in 1917 and 1918 during the First World War, accused of making contact with the enemy (he had written letters to family members in Austria). He was released on grounds of ill health, and exonerated in June 1919.

De László suffered heart problems for the last years of his life. In October 1937, he had a heart attack and died a month later at his home, Hyme House, in Fitzjohns Avenue, Hampstead, London. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

In 1939, &quot;Portrait of a Painter. The Authorized Life of Philip de László&quot; by Owen Rutter, written in conjunction with de László, was published. In 2010, Yale University Press published &quot;De László, His Life and Art&quot; by Duff Hart-Davis and Dr. Caroline Corbeau-Parsons. His reputation still remains largely as a society portrait painter, but well numbered amongst his sitters were industrialists and scientists, politicians and painters, men and women of letters and many other eminent, as well as ordinary, people. Family members and a team of editors are compiling a catalogue raisonné &quot;www.delaszlocatalogueraisonne.com&quot; published online and in progress. His oeuvre currently numbers almost 4,000 works, including drawings.

<text>Sectionalism is loyalty to one&#x27;s own region or section of the country, rather than to the country as a whole.
Sectionalism occurs in many countries, such as in the United Kingdom.

==In the United Kingdom==

Sectionalism occurs most notably in the constituent nation of Scotland, where various sectionalist/separatist political organizations and parties have existed since the early 1920s, beginning with the Scots National League. Today, Scottish sectionalism is most strongly associated and advocated by the Scottish National Party (SNP), which can be described as both sectionalist and separatist. The SNP advocates for both Scottish independence and more autonomy for Scotland while remaining a part of the United Kingdom.

==In the United States==
Sectionalism in 1800s America refers to the different lifestyles, social structures, customs, and the political values of the North and the South. Regional tensions came to a head during the War of 1812, resulting in the Hartford Convention which manifested New England&#x27;s dissatisfaction with a foreign trade embargo that affected its industry disproportionately, as well as dilution of Northern power by new western states, and a succession of Southern Presidents. Sectionalism increased steadily in 1800–1850 as the North industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous factories, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for poor whites who owned no slaves. Southerners defended slavery in part by claiming that Northern factory workers toiled under worse conditions and were not cared for by their employers. Defenders of slavery referred to factory workers as the &quot;white slaves of the North&quot;.

The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas). However, slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas (it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore, Louisville, and St. Louis), so a South based on slavery was rural and non-industrial. On the other hand, as the demand for cotton grew the price of slaves soared, as slaves were considered imperative for the harvest and refinement of cotton. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the Civil War. Historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian Charles Beard in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary.

Historians do agree that social and cultural institutions were very different in the North and South. In the South, wealthy white men owned all of the quality land, leaving poor white farmers with marginal lands of low productivity. Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to suspicious ideas. Members and politicians of the newly formed Republican Party were extremely critical of Southern society and argued that the system of free labor in place in the North resulted in much more prosperity. Republicans criticizing the Southern system of slavery would commonly cite the larger population growth of the Northern states, alongside their rapid growth in factories, farms, and schools as evidence of the superiority of a free labor system.

Southerners argued that it was the North that was changing and was prone to new &quot;isms&quot;, while the South remained true to the historic republican values of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson, and Madison). The issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations. Industrialization meant that seven out of eight European immigrants settled in the North. The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North contributed to the South&#x27;s defensive-aggressive political behavior.

The Western United States was also growing due to the innovations of the railway system and the massive boom in the steel industry. The expansion of the railway system paved the way for agriculturists to produce wool and grain. Westerners were able to develop their own strong sectional identity and embrace their region&#x27;s uniqueness while the Easterners looked down on the Westerners.

==In Spain==
Sectionalism can be found in the Spanish regions of Catalonia, the Spanish portion of the Basque Country, Galicia, and Andalusia.

==In Ukraine==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became its own unitary state, however, also containing regions heavily populated by Russians. This caused a few rebellions throughout the eastern parts of the nation, taking place in the self-declared republics of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, and the peninsula of Crimea. Crimea is disputed by both Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Many nations oppose Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea.

==In Canada==

In 1977, the province of Quebec started an independence movement from Canada, wanting to be an independent French-speaking nation. There were two referendums (1980 and 1995) for whether Quebec would stay as a province of Canada or become its own nation. Both of these referendums failed, keeping Quebec under the governance of the Canadian government. In the north, the Canadian government had given the indigenous Inuit peoples throughout the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut a certain amount of self-governance, allowing them to maintain their cultural practices.

<text>Marko Marulić Splićanin (; ; 18 August 1450 – 5 January 1524), was a Croatian poet, lawyer, judge, and Renaissance humanist. He is the national poet of Croatia. According to George J. Gutsche, Marulić&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Judita&quot; &quot;is the first long poem in Croatian&quot;, and &quot;gives Marulić a position in his own literature comparable to Dante in Italian literature.&quot; Marulić&#x27;s Latin poetry is of such high quality that his contemporaries dubbed him &quot;The Christian Virgil.&quot; He has been called the &quot;crown of the Croatian medieval age&quot;, the &quot;father of the Croatian Renaissance&quot;, and &quot;The Father of Croatian literature.&quot;

Marulić scholar Bratislav Lučin notes that he was well-versed in both the Christian Bible and in the Fathers of the Church. At the same time, Marulić also attentively read the Pre-Christian Greek and Latin Classics. He read and interpreted Latin epigrams, wrote glosses on the erotic poetry of Catullus, read Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;, and admired Erasmus of Rotterdam. Marulić also composed humanist elegies, satirical poetry, erotic epigrams inspired by Ovid, and Latin Christian poetry inspired not only by the epics of Homer and Virgil, but also by Lucan, Statius, Faltonia Betitia Proba, Juvencus, Venantius Fortunatus, Cyprianus Gallus, Coelius Sedulius, and many other both Pagan and Christian writers in the same language.

According to Franz Posset, Marulić aspired to the Renaissance humanist ideal of the &quot;uomo universale&quot; (&quot;universal man&quot;). To this end, he was interested in painting and drawing, local and national history, languages, and poetry. His overall goal always remained &quot;renovatio Christiana&quot; (&quot;The Renewal of Christianity&quot;) as represented by the future Counter-Reformation. Accordingly, like many other Renaissance humanists who shared his views, Marulić denounced simony and immorality among Roman Catholic priests and members of the hierarchy in often violent language throughout his writings.

Although Marulić and Martin Luther lived at the same time and were published by two of the same Basel printers, their collected writings make no mention of each other. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that both theologians were simply unaware of the other&#x27;s existence. At the same time, both men shared a common belief in &quot;Evangelica Veritas&quot; (&quot;Gospel Truth&quot;) and &quot;theology for piety&quot;. They both built their differing theology upon the similar training they received in scholasticism, Renaissance humanism, and &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot;. Like fellow Renaissance humanists Johann Reuchlin, Erasmus of Rotterdam, Thomas More, John Fisher, Juan Luis Vives, and Paolo Riccio, however, Marko Marulić remained committed to an internal renewal of Roman Catholicism and loyal to the Holy See, while Martin Luther and his adherents did not.

Marulić&#x27;s work was admired both by many of the greatest and most influential Catholic saints of the Counter-Reformation and also, since much of Marulić could be read without violating &quot;sola scriptura&quot;, by generations of believers in Protestantism.

His writings in Renaissance Latin, once adored and envied across Europe, shared the destiny that befell most Renaissance Humanist literature and faded into obscurity. According to Lučin, however, the passage of time has slowly revealed the important web of influence that the poet and writer wove all over Europe and far beyond its borders. Marulić&#x27;s writings were admired by churchmen such as Saints Francis Xavier, Francis de Sales, Peter Canisius, and Charles Borromeo, by monarchs and statesmen such as King Henry VIII, Thomas More, and Emperor Carl V, emulated by poets like Jan Dantyszek, Conrad Peutinger, and Francisco de Quevedo, and translated into vernacular verse by still other poets; including Fray Luis de León, St Philipp Howard, Rhina Espaillat, and Edward Mulholland. Furthermore, manuscripts of Marulić works previously thought lost, such as his Christian epic poem the &quot;Davidiad&quot; in 1952, his Latin-Croatian literary translation of Thomas à Kempis&#x27; &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; in 1989, and the Glasgow Codex in 1995, continue to resurface and to belatedly see publication for the first time.

One of Marulić&#x27;s books published in the 1510s is also the first time a literary work used the term &quot;psychology&quot;. More recently, Pope John Paul II quoted from a Marulić poem during his 1998 apostolic visit to Solin, Croatia.

==Biography==
Marulić was born on 18 August 1450 into the Croatian nobility in Split, Dalmatia. He was the first of seven children. The palazzo in which he was born still stands on Papalić Street in Split. His father, Nikola Marulić, was descended from the Pečenić family (&quot;Pecinić&quot;, &quot;Picinić&quot;, Pezzini in Italian). Marulić came from a 15th century branch of the family whose founder was named Petar, and who only began calling themselves Marulić, &quot;Marulus&quot; or &quot;De Marulis&quot;, in the 15th century. His mother, Dobrica de Albertis, was a member of the Italian nobility.

Marko Marulić identified himself primarily as a citizen of Split and, secondly, as a Dalmatian. On the title pages of his books, he consistently signed as a native of Split.

Very little is known about his life, and the few facts that remain are often unreliable. It is certain that he attended a school in Split run by the Italian Renaissance humanist scholar Tideo Acciarini (1430–1490). Marulić&#x27;s education is known also to have included instruction in the Greek language by Hieronymus Genesius Picentinus. Although his library later contained many textbooks on the language, Marulić read and spoke it imperfectly and only rarely used Greek words.

After completing school, Marulić is believed to have studied law at Padua University, after which he spent much of his life in his home town. His star-crossed love affair with a Split noblewoman ended when her father, the commander of the city&#x27;s Venetian military garrison, allegedly buried her alive. A grieving Marulić lived for about two years as a postulant at a monastery on the island of Šolta, in the Adriatic Sea. Returning to Split, Marulić practiced law, serving as a judge, examiner of notarial entries and executor of wills. Owing to his work, he became the most distinguished member of Split&#x27;s humanist circle.

Marulić&#x27;s &quot;Evangelistarium&quot; (&quot;Evangelistary&quot;), a moral and theological compendium of Old and New Testament texts, was first published in 1487. The book was later republished by Italian Jewish publisher Gershom Soncino at Pisa and a copy of that edition was purchased by the German humanist scholar and Hebraist Johann Reuchlin in 1492. In 1519, another edition of the &quot;Evangelistary&quot; was published by Sebastian Münster.

Between 1496 and 1499, Marulić worked on a compendium of Christian morality, entitled &quot;De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints&quot;). According to Latinist and Classicist Edward Mulholland, Marulić&#x27;s primary model for &quot;De institutione&quot; was the &quot;Memorable Deeds and Sayings&quot; of Valerius Maximus. Maximus had intended in the writing of his book, &quot;to spare those who want to learn the lessons of history the trouble of prolonged researches&quot; and accordingly organized the nine books of his volume, &quot;to illustrate a particular virtue or vice&quot;, and it became a widely used textbook in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, both of rhetoric and as, &quot;a gallery of practical moral instruction.&quot;

In addition to Old and New Testament examples, Marulić also drew upon the writings of St Jerome, Gregory the Great, Eusebius of Caesarea, John Cassian, the lives of the saints, and other Ecclesiastical writers.

Marulić&#x27;s &quot;De institutione&quot; was first published in Latin at Venice in 1507 and became well known in the Germanosphere when Adam Petri reprinted it at Basel in 1513. The compendium was widely and repeatedly reprinted and translated into many vernacular languages, which established Marulić&#x27;s fame throughout Europe.

Occasionally Marulić visited Venice (to trade) and Rome (to celebrate the year 1500).

According to his friend and early biographer Franjo Božičević, &quot;for nearly forty years he sweated, shut up with the Muses, in divine volumes, nocturnal study, vigils, fasting, a hair shirt, prayers and rough floggings, not without harsh penance day and night.&quot;

He was a great admirer of the late medieval religious movement known as &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot;. By 1509, Marulić had finished translating Thomas à Kempis&#x27; &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;, a highly important literary and devotional work of the movement, from Medieval Latin into Croatian. His translation, however, remained unpublished until 1989. 

His friend and fellow humanist Dmine Papalić found an old volume of local history composed in the Illyrian language and in the Early Cyrillic alphabet. At his friend&#x27;s urging, Marulić both paraphrased and translated the volume into Latin as &quot;Regum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of the Kings of Dalmatia and Croatia&quot;), as he completed &quot;Quinquaginta parabole&quot; (&quot;Fifty Parables&quot;), which is, according to Edward Mulholland, &quot;Modeled after the parables of the New Testament, they consist in moral lessons in elegant Latin prose drawn from simple stories&quot;. Both books were first published in 1510. He finished writing &quot;The Life of St. Jerome&quot; in 1513. The following year, he completed &quot;Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce&quot; (&quot;Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross&quot;), which has usually been published as part of &quot;De institutione bene vivendi&quot; and which remains his most famous work of Christian poetry in Latin. 

In 1517, Marulić finished his epic poem the &quot;Davidiad&quot;, which was considered lost for more than 400 years, only rediscovered in 1952, and published for the first time in 1954. 

Similarly to both Catholic and Protestant humanists of the same era, Marulić used &quot;The Davidiad&quot; to preach a multilayered interpretation of the Old Testament, as pre-figuring the foundation of Christianity through the later events described in the New Testament. For example, Marulić compared David to Jesus Christ, King Saul to Caiaphas, the Pharisees, and the Sanhedrin, while comparing Goliath to the Devil. Marulić also used his description of David and his warriors eating the Bread of the Presence while fleeing from King Saul an opportunity to praise the Catholic doctrine of the Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament. Furthermore, Marulić&#x27;s study of the Hebrew language was just as often on display in the &quot;Davidiad&quot;; as, despite the difficulties he routinely faced in fitting Hebrew words into the rhythm of Latin dactylic hexameter, he regularly made humorous comments about how very well the etymology of Hebrew personal names fit the character or appearance of their bearers.

According to Edward Mulholland, &quot;Most early modern poets chose as their heroes either ancient historical characters - Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;Africa&quot; (written 1339-43, first published in Venice in 1501) on the Second Punic War showing the lead - or medieval figures such as Charlemagne in Ugolino Verino&#x27;s &quot;Carlias&quot; (1480), or, most frequently, contemporary rulers. Marulić was the very first author to write a Neo-Latin Biblical poem, and he would remain unique in having found his inspiration in the Old Testament. Though certainly a Dalmatian patriot, Marulić did not choose to write a national epic. He is retelling the Biblical story first and foremost, but from the fullness of his multifaceted persona as, in Baumann&#x27;s words, &#x27;a Croat, a humanist, a conservative Catholic, an intellectual and a patrician of Split.&quot; 

Marulić wrote &quot;De humilitate et gloria Christi&quot; (&quot;On the Humility and Glory of Christ&quot;) and &quot;An Account of Illustrious Men of the Old Testament&quot; the following year. 

His final works were &quot;De ultimo Christi judicio&quot; (&quot;On the Last Judgment of Christ&quot;) and &quot;Judita&quot;, Marulić&#x27;s Christian work of epic poetry retelling the &quot;Book of Judith&quot; in the Croatian language, which he produced between 1520 and 1522. The latter, which also drew very heavily upon the Italian poetry of Dante Alighieri and Petrarch, earned Marulić the title &quot;Father of Croatian literature.&quot;

Upon completing the poem on 22 April, which is still celebrated in Croatia as National Book Day (hr), Marulić wrote to a friend, &quot;See it and you will say that the Slavonic language also has its Dante.&quot;

Marko Marulić died in Split on 5 January 1524 and was buried in the Church of St. Francis in the historic city center.

Marulić&#x27;s &quot;Liber de laudibus Herculis&quot; (&quot;A Book in Praise of Hercules&quot;), in which he, &quot;lets the followers of Hercules, the titan of the pagans, compete with the titan of the Christians, that is, Jesus Christ, who, of course, is ultimately the victor&quot;, was posthumously published in 1524. It is also known under the title &quot;Dialogus de Hercule a Christicolis superato&quot; (&quot;The Dialogue about Hercules, Who was Surpassed by Those Who Worship Christ&quot;).

According to Edward Mulholland, &quot;In it he makes the argument that one who has conquered beasts and monsters, as Hercules did, is not as strong as one who has mastered himself, which is the ideal of every Christian. But Marulić also shares his thoughts on the use of mythology and epic. The dialogue is between a theologian and a poet. The question underlying the dialogue seems to be which way is the most secure to arrive at the truth... For Marulić, as Elisabeth von Erdmann points out, pagan myth and poetry gained a certain legitimacy when employed in the service of theology.&quot;

== Legacy ==
During the 16th and 17th century, Marulić&#x27;s three most popular and most widely read works were &quot;De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints&quot;), &quot;Evangelistarium&quot; (&quot;Evangelistary&quot;), and &quot;Quinquaginta parabole&quot; (&quot;Fifty Parables&quot;). By 1680, these three books had been republished more than eighty times not only in the original Latin, but also in many European vernacular languages, including Italian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Flemish, and even Icelandic. For this reason, Marulić is considered one of the most dynamic and influential theological and devotional writers of the Renaissance. 

The British Library still has King Henry VIII&#x27;s Latin-language copy of Marulić&#x27;s &quot;Evangelistiarium&quot;, a book that was read in English and recommended to the King by Sir Thomas More. Extensive margin notes in the King&#x27;s own hand prove that Marulić&#x27;s book was a major source for the &quot;Defence of the Seven Sacraments&quot;, Henry&#x27;s polemic against Lutheranism.

&quot;De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum&quot; (&quot;Instruction on How to Lead a Virtuous Life Based on the Examples of Saints&quot;), a voluminous book of Christian morality based on examples from the Bible and concluding with the Latin poem &quot;Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce&quot; (&quot;Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross&quot;), was first published in 1506 in Venice. 
The final poem, which remains Marulić&#x27;s most famous work of Latin Christian poetry, was published separately in a standalone volume at Erfurt by the German Renaissance humanist and Cistercian abbot Henricus Urbanus in 1514.

&quot;De Institutione&quot; was seen by Roman Catholic priests during the Counter-Reformation as a rich source of stories for use during their preaching and was &quot;considered the work most useful for Catholics in the defense of their ancestral Faith.&quot; &quot;De Institutione&quot; is further known to have had an enormous influence upon St Francis Xavier; it was the only book, aside from the Roman Breviary, that he carried with him and constantly re-read during his missionary work in Portuguese India. St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s copy of the book was returned to Spain after his death and was long treasured in Madrid as a second class relic by the Society of Jesus. Writing in 1961, Marulić scholar Ante Kadić announced that recent inquiries about the volume had come up empty and that he believed the Saint&#x27;s copy must have been destroyed during the May 1931 arson attack by Spanish Republicans against the Jesuit monastery in Madrid. Further research, however, will be needed to determine whether excerpts from &quot;De institutione&quot; were translated into Japanese by Paul Yôhô-ken (1510–1599) and his son and published at Nagasaki by the Jesuits as &quot;Sanctos no go-sagyô no uchi nukigakkan dai-ichi&quot; (&quot;Extracts from the Acts of the Saints&quot;) in 1591.

Due to Marulić having taken a stance in the fourth chapter of the &quot;Instituto&quot; in favour of the then controversial ethical doctrine of mental reservation, namely, &quot;that lying may sometimes be licit, although always undesirable&quot;, the same volume was temporarily placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books and copies were burned at Siena in 1564.

While imprisoned for recusancy in the Tower of London under Queen Elizabeth I, St. Philip Howard, who was later canonized in 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, wrote a translation into Elizabethan English verse of Marulić&#x27;s poem &quot;Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce&quot; (&quot;A Dialogue Betwixt a Christian and Christ Hanging on the Crosse&quot;). Howard also produced an English translation of John Justus of Landsberg&#x27;s &quot;Alloquia Jesu Christi ad animam fidelem&quot; (&quot;An Epistle in the Person of Jesus Christ to the Faithful Soule&quot;) during his imprisonment in the Tower, which was posthumously published at Antwerp, in the Spanish Netherlands (1595). St. Philip Howard&#x27;s translation of Marulić&#x27;s poem was published instead of a preface to the Antwerp edition and again, with updated English orthography, as part of the March/April 2022 issue of the literary magazine, &quot;St. Austin Review&quot;. During the parallel literary and cultural flowering known as the Spanish Golden Age, same dialogue poem by Marulić was similarly translated into an immortal work of Castilian Spanish verse by the Augustinian friar Luis de León.

On October 4, 1998, Pope John Paul II quoted from Marulić&#x27;s &quot;Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce&quot; (&quot;Poem about the Teaching of Our Lord Jesus Christ Hanging on the Cross&quot;) during an apostolic visit to Solin, Croatia, &quot;One of your poets has written, &quot;Felix qui semper vitae bene computat usum&quot; (&#x27;Happy is he who always puts his life to good use.&#x27;) It is vital to choose true values, not those which pass, to choose genuine truth, not half-truths and pseudo-truths. Do not trust those who promise you easy solutions. Nothing great can be built without sacrifice.&quot;

In 2024, Edward Mulholland, a Latinist and Classicist from the faculty of Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas, published the first complete English translation of the &quot;Davidiad&quot; in un-rhymed iambic pentameter. The work, which also includes an English translation of the &quot;Tropologica Expositio&quot;, was released as an entry in LYSA Publishers&#x27;s &quot;LYNX&quot; book series dedicated to neo-Latin texts. 

In his introduction Mulholland explained, &quot;The translation of a Vergilian epic owes much to translators of Vergil.&quot; Mulholland according expressed gratitude to the previous translators of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, especially Gavin Douglas, John Dryden, Robert Fagles, and Robert Fitzgerald. Mulholland also explained that he had chosen to follow the existing convention that, &quot;English epic poetry ... uses alliteration more often than Latin does.&quot; For this reason, Mulholland decided to publish his translation side by side with the Latin original, so that those able to read both languages could compare them to one another.

In 2023, Mulholland&#x27;s translation of Book XIV had been named an honorable mention during the British Centre for Literary Translation&#x27;s John Dryden Translation Competition.

==Writing==
The central figure of the humanist circle in Split, Marulić was inspired by the Bible, ancient writers and Christian hagiographies. The main topics of his writings were Christian theological by nature. He wrote many poems, discussions on theology and Christian ethics, stories and epic poetry. He wrote in three languages: Renaissance Latin (more than 80% of his surviving opus), Croatian and Italian (three letters and two sonnets are preserved). 

=== Croatian works ===
In his Croatian-language works, Marulić achieved a permanent status and position that has remained uncontested. His central Croatian oeuvre, the epic poem &quot;Judita&quot; (&quot;&quot;) written in 1501 and published in Venice in 1521, is based on the Biblical tale from a Deuterocanonical &quot;Book of Judith&quot;, written in Čakavian dialect, his mother tongue, and described by him as &quot;u versi haruacchi slozhena&quot; (&quot;arranged in Croatian stanzas&quot;). His other works in Croatian are:

* &quot;Suzana&quot; (&quot;Susanna&quot;) – a Biblical poem in 780 verses, based on the account from the &quot;Book of Daniel&quot; of the Babylonian Jewish woman of the same name who was falsely accused of adultery and how her innocence was proven and she was saved from death by stoning by the timely intervention and interrogation of her accusers by the Prophet Daniel.
* &quot;Poklad i korizma&quot; (Carnival and Lent), &quot;Spovid koludric od sedam smrtnih grihov&quot; (&quot;A Nun&#x27;s Confession of the Seven Deadly Sins&quot;), &quot;Anka satir&quot; (Anka: A Satire) – secular poetry, and poetry dedicated to his sister &quot;Bira&quot;
* &quot;Tužen&#x27;je grada Hjerosolima&quot; (Jerusalem&#x27;s Lament) – anti-Turkish laments
* &quot;Molitva suprotiva Turkom&quot; (&quot;A Prayer Against the Turks&quot;) – poem in 172 doubly rhymed dodecasyllablic stanzas of anti-Turkish theme, written between 1493 and 1500. The poem contains the hidden acrostic &quot;Solus deus potes nos liberare de tribulatione inimicorum nostrorum Turcorum sua potentia infinita,&quot; &quot;Only God with his infinite might can save us from the misery of our enemies, the Turks&quot;, discovered by Luko Paljetak. It is believed to show the influence of Juraj Šižgorić&#x27;s &quot;Elegija o pustošenju Šibenskog polja&quot; and the medieval song &quot;Spasi, Marije, tvojih vjernih&quot; from Tkonski miscellany. Marulić&#x27;s poem in turn has influenced Zoranić&#x27;s &quot;Planine&quot; – the first Croatian novel, in which &quot;ganka pastira Marula&quot; alludes to Turks, and also to Petar Lučić and his work &quot;Molitva Bogu protiv Turkom&quot;, and Primož Trubar&#x27;s &quot;Pjesni zuper Turke&quot;.

American historian John Van Antwerp Fine, Jr. emphasizes that Marulić belongs to a group of humanists and clerics placed in the &quot;Croat&quot; camp who, at least at the time they wrote their texts, did not seem to have a Croatian ethnic identity.
It must be noted however, that a critical review of Fine&#x27;s work highlighted subjective conclusions. Neven Budak of the University of Zagreb noted &quot;ideological prejudices&quot;, &quot;omission of historical facts&quot; and &quot;preconceived conclusions&quot; due to Fine&#x27;s alleged personal bias regarding the former Yugoslavia and its various ethnic groups.

=== Latin works ===
Marulić&#x27;s European fame rested mainly on his works written in Renaissance Latin which were repeatedly re-published.

His &quot;Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae&quot;, written between 1510 and 1517, contains the earliest known literary reference to the term psychology.

In 1517, Marulić completed the &quot;Davidiad&quot; an epic poem which retold the Old Testament story of King David in Virgilian Latin with multiple references to Greek and Roman mythology. In addition to the small portions that attempt to recall Homer, the &quot;Davidiad&quot; is heavily modeled upon Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Indeed, the work was so heavily indebted to the Aeneid that Marulić&#x27;s contemporaries called him the &quot;Christian Virgil from Split.&quot; Serbian-American philologist Miroslav Marcovich also detects &quot;the influence of Ovid, Lucan, and Statius&quot; in the work.

The &quot;Davidiad&quot; was considered lost by 1567 and long remained so. After a search lasting nearly two centuries by Croatian literary scholars at libraries and archives throughout Europe, Marulic&#x27;s original manuscript (Ms. T) resurfaced at the Turin National University Library in 1922. News of its existence and the fact that it had never previously been published was spread throughout Classical academia by Carlo Dionisotti in 1952. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published by Josip Badalić of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1954, but this work &quot;proved to be a failure,&quot; as whole verses were left out and many words were misread by the editor. Several years later, in 1957, Miroslav Marcovich overcame many of the difficulties that plagued Badalić&#x27;s work and produced a more usable critical edition. Latinist Veljko Gortan eventually corrected around 50 instances of misread words and published his own critical edition in 1974. A literary translation of the &quot;Davidiad&quot; into Croatian hexameters was made by Branimir Glavačić and published alongside the Latin original as part of Veljko Gortan&#x27;s edition in 1974. 

Marulić was active in the struggles against the Ottoman Turks who were invading the Croatian lands at that time. To this end, he wrote a Latin &quot;Epistola&quot; to Pope Adrian VI and begged for assistance in the fight against the Ottomans. In his epigram &quot;In discordiam principium Christianorum&quot; (&quot;Against Discord between the Princes of the Christians&quot;), Marulić denounced the monarchs of Europe for warring among themselves at a time when the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the janissaries were invading Christendom.

=== Glasgow codex ===

A Marulić manuscript found in Glasgow University Library threw new light on his work and persona. It was discovered in 1995 by Darko Novaković, who stated that, in comparison with Marulić&#x27;s known carmina minora, the poems in the codex introduce three thematic novelties. Unexpectedly vehement, satirical epigrams are featured and the intensity of his satirical impulse is startling, even in such conventional poems as epitaphs. Three poems reveal his love of animals. The greatest revelation are the verses which show Marulić as the author of love poems. This aspect represents the most serious challenge to the traditional picture of the poet: the last epigram in the collection is a true Priapeum marked with lascivious ambiguity.

According to Fisković, Marulić was an accomplished illustrator. In his will he left to his sister a book he illustrated and conceived. The second edition of &quot;Judita&quot;, prepared by Zadar publisher Jerolim Mirković, dated 30 May 1522, is adorned with nine woodcuts, the last of which is signed &quot;M&quot;. It is assumed that the illustrations were created by Marulić himself.

== Commemoration ==
Marulić&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 500 kuna banknote, issued in 1993.

The Croatian state decoration awarded for special merit in culture, the Order of Danica Hrvatska, is ornamented with the face of Marko Marulić.

The Festival of Croatian Drama in Split – &#x27;Festival Marulićevi dani&#x27; (Festival of Marulić days) – is named after Marulić and gives annual MARUL awards.

The revue &quot;Marulić&quot; (hr) and the journal &quot;Colloquia Maruliana&quot; are named after him. Marulianum is a scientific centre of Split Literary Circle dedicated to research on Marulić.

By the decree of Sabor in 1996, 22 April is commemorated in Croatia as the Day of the Croatian Book (hr) in tribute to Marulić and his &quot;Judita&quot;. Sabor declared 2021 in Croatia as a Year of Marko Marulić and Year of reading in Croatia, marking 500 years since the publication of &quot;Judita&quot;. The Croatian government declared 2024 as the Year of Marko Marulić in memorial of the 500th anniversary of his death.

<text>Cheryl Gallant (born May 23, 1960) is a Canadian politician who represents the riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke in the House of Commons of Canada. She is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. Along with fellow MP Scott Reid, they are the longest-serving current Conservative MPs, and the last two MPs still serving who were members of Canadian Alliance.

==Early life and career==
Gallant was born in Sarnia, Ontario. She attended the University of Western Ontario, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry. Prior to becoming a politician, she worked for a major Canadian life insurance company as a group insurance executive and for a time as an office manager of a family-owned professional practice. Gallant has been married since 1985, and is the parent of four daughters. She has served as the Chair of the City of Pembroke Downtown Development Commission and as a member of the Economic Advisory Committee for the city.

==Political career==
Gallant won her seat in the 2000 federal election, defeating Liberal incumbent Hec Clouthier and making history as the first woman elected to federal office in Renfrew County. Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke was one of only three Ontario federal riding districts not to elect a Liberal. Gallant took advantage of local opposition to Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, and benefited from backlash to Clouthier&#x27;s support for gun control.

She is currently a member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, having previously been a member of the Canadian Alliance party from 2000 to 2003. She is largely viewed as one of the most vocal social conservatives in the House of Commons. While a popular figure among the Christian Right and property rights activists, she regularly draws the ire of opponents. Serving in a riding with the largest military base and only national nuclear research facility in Canada, she has advocated for increased federal support for CFB Petawawa and the Chalk River Laboratories.

During the 37th Parliament, Gallant served as deputy house leader of the Official Opposition. She has served as CPC critic for science, research and development, was a member of the Commons Standing Committee on National Defence and Veteran&#x27;s Affairs, and the Standing Committee on Industry. She has also served as opposition critic of Canadian Heritage, Amateur Sport, the National Capital Commission, Science, Research and Development, the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario, and Small Business.

In the 38th Parliament, Gallant served as a member on the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Joint Committee on Library of Parliament, and the Library of Parliament.

Her service continued in the 39th Parliament, where she served on the committee for the Status of Women, National Defence, and Library of Parliament.

In the 2008 election, Gallant won her fourth term in Parliament, winning 28,906 of 47,314 votes (61.1% of the total). Her nearest rival, Liberal candidate Carole Devine, received 9,740 votes (20.6%).

During the 40th Parliament, she served for varying lengths of time as a member on the following committees: National Defence, the Library of Parliament, the Subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure on the Standing Committee on National Defence, Scrutiny of Regulations, Natural Resources, and Transport, Infrastructure, and Communities.

In the 2011 election, Gallant won her fifth term in Parliament in a landslide election, collecting 27,462 of 51,398 votes (53.43% of the total). Her closest opponent, Independent Hec Clouthier, received 9,611 votes (18.70%).

During the 41st Parliament, Gallant served as a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, and Technology, as well as the Standing Committee on National Defence.
She was elected by colleagues to represent Canada as Chair of the Canadian-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Parliamentary Association. The Canada-NATO Parliamentary Association consists of membership of all political parties represented in the House of Commons.

In March 2012, Gallant traveled to Norway to observe Canadian Forces from Petawawa participate in NATO exercises. In April 2012, she received second place in &quot;The Hill Times&quot; poll for Best Conservative Constituency MP.

Gallant was re-elected for a sixth term in the 2015 election. In a statement on April 2, 2019, Gallant addressed the Speaker in the House regarding carbon pricing in Canada stating that the effects would necessitate higher tuition fees on college and university students to make up for increased heating and carbon payments.

Gallant was challenged for the Conservative nomination in Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke for the 2019 election by Mike Coates, the campaign manager for former Conservative leadership candidate Kevin O&#x27;Leary. However, Gallant was successful in winning the nomination 866 votes to 522.

On October 21, 2019, Gallant was re-elected for her seventh term in office after winning 30,387 of 57,506 ballots cast, or 52.67% of the vote. She is the longest serving woman in the federal caucus. During the ensuing 43rd Canadian Parliament, she introduced one private member bill, Bill C-222, &quot;An Act to amend the Expropriation Act&quot; (protection of private property) which sought to disallow the exemption of a public hearing in cases where private land is being expropriated for the purposes of &quot;restoring historical natural habitats or addressing, directly or indirectly, climate variability&quot;. It was brought to a vote on February 17, 2021, but defeated with only Conservatives Party members voting in favour.
In the 2020 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election she endorsed Peter MacKay.

She won re-election in the 2021 election, despite being &quot;nowhere to be found&quot; during the campaign, according to CTV News Ottawa. During the campaign, Gallant claimed &quot;Now that the pandemic is passing, they’re rebranding climate change as a climate emergency in order to justify climate lockdowns.&quot; The claim was cited by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an example of a need for Conservative leader Erin O&#x27;Toole to control his candidates.

==Controversies==
In 2002, she made anti-gay remarks to then Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham, when during a heated exchange, she shouted &quot;Ask your boyfriend&quot; and &quot;How&#x27;s your boyfriend?&quot;.

Shortly before the 2004 election, Gallant made headlines for her criticism of Bill C-250, an amendment to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, introduced by NDP MP Svend Robinson which would protect sexual orientation from hate propaganda. Among other things, Gallant claimed that the bill would limit freedom of opinion, make sections of the Bible &quot;hate literature&quot; and provide protection to pedophiles.

During the 2004 election, a controversy erupted when Gallant compared abortion to the beheading of Iraq War hostage Nick Berg. The Conservative Party then announced that she was suffering from laryngitis, and after this, she did not appear at some scheduled debates.

Gallant resurfaced in the spotlight on March 17, 2005, when she suggested that Christians were being persecuted by the Liberal Party in a flyer she sent to her constituents. Conservative leader Stephen Harper, confronted with the news, said &quot;I&#x27;ll let Cheryl Gallant explain those remarks herself; I haven&#x27;t seen them.&quot;

Several constituents have accused Gallant of obtaining birth-date information from passport applications during the 2006 campaign. Her office regularly sent out greeting cards to constituents when their birthday came. One affected resident told the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, &quot;The principle is really bothering me: that my information has been gathered without my knowledge. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s going to be used.&quot; Two families who received cards have sent letters to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, asking confirmation the MP won&#x27;t use the collected personal information. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has no jurisdiction in investigating such matters. Gallant&#x27;s aide says the Member receives many requests for birthday and anniversary cards, and the office is unsure how the information was put on the list, since Gallant receives thousands of requests for salutations and the birth date could have been on one of the request forms returned by a constituent. In addition, two constituents named Mr. and Mrs. White, who were unsatisfied with the response they received from Gallant&#x27;s office, contacted the Liberal MP for Ottawa-Vanier Mauril Bélanger. Bélanger contacted the Office of the Ethics Commissioner on their behalf, who found grounds for and did conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter. Although in their report they commented &quot;personal information should only be used for the purpose for which it is gathered, or for a use consistent with that purpose,&quot; they found Gallant&#x27;s use of the information did not further her private interests as alleged. Because the use of the constituents&#x27; information did not meet the definition in Section 3(2) of the Member&#x27;s Code for furthering private interests, the Office of the Ethics Commissioner discontinued their inquiry.

Of around 60 major candidates in 15 Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec ridings, Gallant was the only one who didn&#x27;t attending a meeting with the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; editorial board. &quot;Ms. Gallant&#x27;s decision to duck every difficult question from the media is nothing short of childish&quot;, commented &quot;Citizen&quot; columnist Kelly Egan. Gallant has stated that she was focused on campaigning locally in order to keep in touch with the concerns of local constituents.

In February 2011, during Defence Committee hearings in St. John&#x27;s before an audience which included the family and co-workers of mariners lost at sea in recent accidents on the Atlantic, Gallant remarked, &quot;In Ontario we have inland seas, the Great Lakes, and it would never occur to any of us, even up in the Ottawa River, to count on the Coast Guard to come and help us.&quot; Gallant said federal search and ocean rescue should be coordinated with privately operated resources and local governments. Gallant&#x27;s comparison of recreational boaters in sheltered inland waters to mariners on the Atlantic hundreds of miles from land drew outrage from many who had lost family at sea. She initially refused to apologize saying her remarks were misinterpreted, but on February 10, Gallant said she was sorry and did not mean to minimize ocean dangers.

On March 28, 2011, after stating in a press release that she hoped for a clean election campaign, Gallant compared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff to Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Gallant wrote on her Twitter page: &quot;No carbon tax please, Igaffi!&quot; Her initial tweet was deleted, but not before it was screen-captured and distributed to the national press. She tweeted an apology to Ignatieff for her remarks on April 1.

In March 2016, Gallant caused further outrage and controversy by using the death of Corporal Nathan Cirillo as a means to generate money for her campaign through an Easter ham lottery. Cirillo was killed while standing guard at the National War Memorial on Oct. 22, 2014.

In May 2016, Gallant accused the Rideau Institute of having ties to North Korea, Iran, and Russia on account of the Institute having those countries as options on their donation page when stating their nation of origin.

In June 2017, Gallant was the only Member of Parliament to vote against a government motion re-affirming support for the Paris Agreement.

In February 2021, Gallant was recorded on a Zoom meeting with a university student group, accusing Liberals of wanting to “normalize sexual activity with children”.

During the so-called &quot;Freedom Convoy&quot;, Gallant commented on her Facebook page to &quot;Watch for Trudeau&#x27;s gang to pull off false flag operations.&quot; She advertised a Pembroke protest on her Facebook page, and has encouraged protests nationwide.

<text>Roger Philip Bresnahan (June 11, 1879 – December 4, 1944), nicknamed &quot;the Duke of Tralee&quot;, was an American player and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a player, Bresnahan competed in MLB for the Washington Senators (1897), Chicago Orphans (1900), Baltimore Orioles (1901–02), New York Giants (1902–1908), St. Louis Cardinals (1909–1912) and Chicago Cubs (1913–1915). Bresnahan also managed the Cardinals (1909–1912) and Cubs (1915). He was a member of the 1905 World Series champions.

Bresnahan began his MLB career as a pitcher. He also served as an outfielder, before becoming a regular catcher. For his MLB career, Bresnahan had a .279 batting average in 4,480 at bats and a 328–432 managerial win–loss record. Bresnahan popularized the use of protective equipment in baseball by introducing shin guards, to be worn by catchers, in 1907. He also developed the first batting helmet.

After retiring as a player, Bresnahan remained active in professional baseball. He owned the minor league Toledo Mud Hens and coached for the Giants and Detroit Tigers. In 1945, Bresnahan was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Roger Philip Bresnahan was born on June 11, 1879, in Toledo, Ohio. He was the seventh child of Michael and Mary Bresnahan, who had immigrated to the United States from Tralee, Ireland. Bresnahan used to claim that he was also from Tralee, and early in his life, he earned the nickname &quot;The Duke of Tralee&quot;.

Bresnahan began playing baseball in grade school, becoming one of the best known sandlot baseball players. He continued to play baseball at Toledo&#x27;s Central High School.

==Semiprofessional career==
At 16, Bresnahan signed with a semi-professional team from Manistee, Michigan. After he graduated high school, Bresnahan signed with Lima of the Ohio State League, where he played primarily as a pitcher, but also as a catcher in 1895 and 1896.

==Professional career==
===Washington Senators (1897)===

On August 10, 1897, the Washington Senators of the National League (NL) in Major League Baseball (MLB) purchased Bresnahan from Lima. He began his MLB career as a pitcher, throwing a six-hit shutout in his MLB debut against the St. Louis Browns on August 27, 1897, recording three strikeouts and walking two batters. He had six hits in 16 at bats (a .375 batting average) and had a 4–0 win–loss record for the 1897 Senators. However, the Senators released Bresnahan after the season over a salary dispute, when he attempted to hold out for more money. The Senators offered Bresnahan $2,000 ($ in current dollar terms), but Bresnahan wanted $2,400 ($ in current dollar terms).

Bresnahan played for the Toledo Mud Hens of the Interstate League and the Minneapolis Millers of the Western League in 1898, and the Millers and Buffalo Bisons of the Western League in 1899.

===Chicago Orphans (1900)===
Bresnahan appeared in two games at catcher for the Chicago Orphans of the NL in 1900, which served as a tryout.

With the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, Bresnahan, among others, jumped to the AL from the NL. John McGraw, manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL saw Bresnahan pitch for Chicago, and decided to sign him for the Orioles before the 1901 season. For the Orioles, Bresnahan filled in at catcher behind Wilbert Robinson, and also appeared in the outfield. A faster baserunner than the average catcher, Bresnahan had two inside-the-park home runs on May 30, 1902.

===New York Giants (1902–1908)===
With the Orioles reportedly in significant debt, part-owner John Mahon purchased shares of the team from star players Joe Kelley and John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL, becoming the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, he sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released Bresnahan, Kelley, Joe McGinnity, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, Gilbert, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants.
With Frank Bowerman and Jack Warner established as the Giants&#x27; catchers, McGraw played Bresnahan as the center fielder for the Giants. In 1903, Bresnahan batted .350, trailing Honus Wagner&#x27;s .355 average atop the NL. Bresnahan batted .284 in the 1904 season, playing 96 games in the outfield, ten games at first base, four games at shortstop, and one game apiece at second base and third base, as the Giants were champions of the NL.

Bresnahan shifted to catcher full-time in 1905, as Bowerman became less effective and Warner left the Giants. Christy Mathewson preferred pitching to Bresnahan. Bresnahan caught all five games in the 1905 World Series, including three shutouts by Mathewson, and one shutout thrown by Joe McGinnity. Bresnahan led the Giants with a .313 batting average in the World Series.

On Opening Day in 1907, Bresnahan began to experiment with protective gear. Though Negro league catcher Chappie Johnson wore protective gear and Nig Clarke wore similar gear in MLB in 1905, most catchers did not wear any protective equipment at that time. Bresnahan practiced in shin guards that are worn in cricket during spring training, and debuted them on April 11, 1907. Fans, used to seeing catchers play without protective equipment, threw snowballs on the field, and without police at the game, umpire Bill Klem called off the game, with the Giants forfeiting to the Philadelphia Phillies. The press also criticized the use of shin guards. However, other catchers began to adopt Bresnahan&#x27;s idea. Though Pittsburgh Pirates manager Fred Clarke protested Bresnahan&#x27;s gear to the league, the protest was denied and the equipment was approved. Bresnahan caught a career-high 138 games in 1908, batting .283 and leading the NL in walks.

Bresnahan also developed the first batting helmet. He was hit in the head with a pitch by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907. Bresnahan was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites. Bresnahan was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become commonplace until the 1940s. Bresnahan was also the first catcher to wear a padded facemask while catching.

==Managerial career==
===St. Louis Cardinals (1909–1912)===
The Giants obtained younger and faster players in 1909; McGraw had Chief Meyers ready to succeed Bresnahan at catcher. Stanley Robison of the St. Louis Cardinals became interested in hiring Bresnahan to be a player-manager. As McGraw did not want to block Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for Red Murray, Bugs Raymond and Admiral Schlei after the 1908 season. Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910. Attendance increased from 205,000 fans in 1908 to 299,000 fans in 1909, and 355,000 fans in 1910.
Grateful for the improvement at the box office, Robison signed Bresnahan to a five-year contract to manage the team for a salary of $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), plus ten percent of the club&#x27;s profits. Robison died in March 1911, and ownership of the team transferred to Helene Hathaway Britton, his niece.

On July 11, 1911, with the Cardinals only three games out of first place, the team was involved in a train wreck while riding the &quot;Federal Express&quot; from Philadelphia to Boston. Fourteen passengers were killed after the train derailed and plunged down an embankment outside Bridgeport, Connecticut. None of the Cardinals were seriously injured, due to a fortuitous pre-trip change in the location of their Pullman car, requested by Bresnahan. The Cardinals helped remove bodies and rescue the injured.

Bresnahan and Britton feuded publicly in 1912, as the Cardinals fell to sixth place in the NL. The Cardinals fired Bresnahan after the 1912 season due to various arguments Bresnahan had with Britton, including over Bresnahan&#x27;s desire to sell Miller Huggins to another franchise. Britton cited decreased profits as a sign that Bresnahan was uninterested in the job. Huggins succeeded Bresnahan as Cardinals&#x27; manager, as she preferred Huggins&#x27; &quot;gentlemanly&quot; manner, as opposed to Bresnahan&#x27;s rougher personality. Bresnahan hired an attorney to obtain the remainder of his salary. He eventually settled the lawsuit against Britton for $20,000 ($ in current dollar terms).

===Chicago Cubs (1913–1915)===
Following his termination by the Cardinals, the NL declared Bresnahan a free agent. He signed a three-year contract with the Cubs, receiving $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per season with a $25,000 signing bonus ($ in current dollar terms). He served as player-manager for the Cubs in 1915, but was released when his batting average slipped.

===Later career===
As the rival Federal League collapsed and the Cubs merged with the Chicago Whales of the Federal League, the Cubs decided to replace Bresnahan with Whales manager Joe Tinker.

The Cubs paid Bresnahan for the remaining two years on his contract and aided Bresnahan in purchasing the Toledo Mud Hens, then in the American Association, in 1916. The club had moved to Cleveland to block the Federal League from placing a team there, but returned to Toledo under Bresnahan&#x27;s control. Bresnahan played for the team until 1918, when he announced his retirement. He played for a semi-professional team in 1919, and appeared in five games for the Mud Hens in 1921. Bresnahan worked to add lights to Toledo&#x27;s stadium, so that they could play night games.

Bresnahan sold the Mud Hens before the 1924 season. McGraw then hired Bresnahan as a coach for the Giants, a position he held from 1925 through 1928. He coached for the Detroit Tigers in 1930 and 1931.

===Post-baseball career===
During the offseasons, Bresnahan returned to Toledo. He worked as a hotel detective at the Boody House, which he later purchased. Bresnahan lost much of his money in the stock market crash of 1929. He worked as a manual laborer, as a guard at the Toledo Workhouse, and as a salesman for Toledo&#x27;s Buckeye Brewing Company.

Bresnahan ran for sheriff of Lucas County as a member of the Democratic Party in 1932. He lost, and endorsed the victorious candidate in his reelection bid two years later. Bresnahan ran for county commissioner in 1944, winning the Democratic Party nomination, but losing in the general election by a few hundred votes out of 140,000 votes cast.

Bresnahan died of a heart attack at his home in Toledo on December 4, 1944, at the age of 65. He was survived by his wife, Gertrude, and his daughter, Marian. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Toledo.

==Profile and legacy==

In 1,446 games, he had a batting average of .279 with 26 home runs and 530 runs batted in in 4,480 at-bats. His overall managerial record was . Miller Huggins named Bresnahan the catcher on his all-time team.

Bresnahan stood approximately . He was described as &quot;highly strung and almost abnormally emotional&quot; by a reporter. Bill James wrote that Bresnahan &quot;was one of those guys that if you were on his team and played hard he was as nice to you as could be, but if you got on his bad side you&#x27;d think he was the Breath of Hell.&quot;

Bresnahan was known for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few occasions escorted from the field by police. A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch, compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing batters with verbal abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.

Bresnahan was elected to the Hall of Fame the year after his death. He had received 47 votes of the 226 electors in the 1936 Hall of Fame balloting, and between 43 and 67 votes each time from 1937 through 1942. In the 1945 balloting, occurring one month after Bresnahan&#x27;s death, he received 133 votes, still falling short of enshrinement. However, the Permanent Committee noticed the surge in votes and elected him in April 1945.

Regarding his Hall of Fame induction, James has criticized the election, saying that Bresnahan &quot;wandered in the Hall of Fame on a series of miscalculations&quot;, and regarding his election, that &quot;the Hall of Fame had, for the first time, selected a player who clearly had no damn business being there&quot;.

==Commemorations==
Bresnahan was mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

<doc id="479273" wikidata="Q25278" url="?curid=479273" title="Dwight Howard">
<text>Dwight David Howard II (born December 8, 1985) is an American professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Superman&quot; for his athletic prowess, he was an NBA champion, eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA Team honoree, five-time All-Defensive Team member, and three-time Defensive Player of the Year.

Howard, who plays center, spent his high school career at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy. He chose to forgo college, entered the 2004 NBA draft, and was selected first overall by the Orlando Magic. Howard set numerous franchise and league records with the Magic and led the team to the 2009 NBA Finals. In 2012, after eight seasons with Orlando, Howard was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he spent three separate one year-stints over the course of his career, winning the NBA Finals in 2020. He has also played for the Houston Rockets, the Atlanta Hawks, the Charlotte Hornets, the Washington Wizards, and the Philadelphia 76ers.

After the 2021–22 NBA season, Howard moved overseas and signed with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League. In his lone season with the team, he was named a T1 All-Star.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and is the athletic director at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the country&#x27;s best high school basketball programs; his mother played on the inaugural women&#x27;s basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard&#x27;s mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine. Despite his large frame, Howard was quick and versatile enough to play the guard position. He attended Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy and played mostly as power forward, averaging 16.6 points, 13.4 rebounds and 6.3 blocks per game in 129 appearances. As a senior, Howard led his team to a 31–2 record and the 2004 state title, while averaging 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks and 3.5 assists per game. The same year, he was widely recognized as the best American high school basketball player, and received the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award, the Morgan Wootten High School Player of the Year Award, Gatorade National Player of the Year and the McDonald&#x27;s National High School Player of the Year honor. He was also co-MVP (with J. R. Smith) of the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game that year. On January 31, 2012, Howard was honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans.

==Professional career==

===Orlando Magic (2004–2012)===

====Early years (2004–2008)====
Following his high school successes, Howard chose to forego college and declared for the 2004 NBA draft—a decision partly inspired by his idol Kevin Garnett who had done the same in 1995—where the Orlando Magic selected him first overall over UConn junior Emeka Okafor. He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett&#x27;s 21 when he played for Minnesota. Howard joined a depleted Magic squad that had finished with only 21 victories the previous season; further, the club had just lost perennial NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady. Howard, however, made an immediate impact. He finished his rookie season with an average of 12 points and 10 rebounds, setting several NBA records in the process. He became the youngest player in NBA history to average a double double in the regular season. He also became the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 10 rebounds in a season and youngest NBA player ever to record at least 20 rebounds in a game. Howard&#x27;s importance to the Magic was highlighted when he became the first player in NBA history directly out of high school to start all 82 games during his rookie season. For his efforts, he was selected to play in the 2005 NBA Rookie Challenge, and was unanimously selected to the All-Rookie Team. He also finished third in the Rookie of the Year voting.

Howard reported to camp for his second NBA season having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season. Orlando coach Brian Hill—responsible for grooming former Magic superstar Shaquille O&#x27;Neal—decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center. Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up game and his defense. He exerted extra pressure on Howard, saying that the Magic would need him to emerge as a force in the middle before the team had a chance at the playoffs. On November 15, 2005, in a home game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Howard recorded 21 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to score 20 or more points and gather 20 or more rebounds in the same game. He was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the 2006 Rookie Challenge during the All-Star break. Overall, he averaged 15.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, ranking second in the NBA in rebounds per game, offensive rebounds, and double-doubles and sixth in field goal percentage. Despite Howard&#x27;s improvement, the Magic finished the season with a 36–46 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive season since Howard&#x27;s arrival.
In the 2006–07 season (and for the third consecutive season), Howard played in all 82 regular-season games. On February 1, 2007, he received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve on the Eastern Conference squad for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. On February 9, he made a game-winning alley-oop off an inbound pass at the buzzer against the San Antonio Spurs. Howard set a new career high with 35 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on April 14. Under his leadership, the Magic qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. There, the Magic were swept by the Detroit Pistons in the first round. For the season, Howard averaged 17.6 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, finishing first in the NBA in total rebounds, second in field goal percentage, and ninth in blocks. He was named to the All-NBA Third Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.

Howard continued posting impressive numbers in the 2007–08 season and helped the Magic have their best season to date. Howard was named as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star team. On February 16, 2008, he won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest by receiving 78% of the fan&#x27;s votes via text messaging or online voting; in that contest, he performed a series of innovative dunks said to have rejuvenated the contest, including donning a Superman cape for one of the dunks. Howard led the Magic to their first division title in 12 years and to the third seed for the 2008 NBA Playoffs. In their first round match-up against the Toronto Raptors, Howard&#x27;s dominance (three 20-point/20-rebound games) helped Orlando to prevail in five games. Howard&#x27;s series total of 91 rebounds was also greater than the total rebounds collected by the entire Toronto frontcourt. In the second round against the Pistons, the Magic lost in five games. For the season, Howard was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time, and was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.

====Dominance and NBA Finals appearance (2008–2011)====

The 2008–09 season began well for Howard. Ten games into the season, the center was leading the league in blocks per game (4.2). In December, Howard injured his left knee, which caused him to miss a game due to injury for the first time in his NBA career; previously, he had played in 351 consecutive games. He garnered a record 3.1 million votes to earn the starting berth on the Eastern Conference team for the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. Howard led Orlando to its second straight Southeast Division title and to the third seed for the 2009 NBA Playoffs; the team finished the season with a 59–23 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the 76ers, Howard recorded 24 points and 24 rebounds in Game 5 to give Orlando a 3–2 lead before the Magic closed out the series in six games. In the second round against the Boston Celtics, after the Magic blew a lead in Game 5 to fall behind 3–2 in the series, Howard publicly stated that he should have been given the ball more and questioned coach Stan Van Gundy&#x27;s tactics. The Magic went on to defeat Boston to win the series and move on to the Eastern Conference Finals. There they, defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–2. Howard had a playoff career-high 40 points to go with his 14 rebounds in the deciding Game 6, leading Orlando to the NBA Finals for the first time in 14 years. In the NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers took the first two home games, before a home win by the Magic brought the deficit to 2–1. In Game 4, despite Howard putting up 21 rebounds and a Finals record of 9 blocks in a game, the Magic lost in overtime. The Lakers went on to clinch the series with a win in Game 5. For the season, Howard became the youngest player ever to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team, and to the All-NBA First Team.
In the 2009–10 season, the Magic got off to a strong start, winning 17 of their first 21 games and setting a franchise record. On January 21, 2010, Howard was named as the starting center for the East in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. The Magic completed the regular season with 59 wins and their third consecutive division title. The Magic&#x27;s playoff run resulted another Eastern Conference Finals appearance, where they lost in six games to the Celtics. Howard won the Defensive Player of the Year Award for the second straight year. He became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in blocks and rebounds in the same season twice—and for two years in a row.

In the 2010–11 season, Howard posted career highs in points and field goal percentage. He became the first player in league history to win Defensive Player of the Year honors for three consecutive seasons. Howard led the league in double-doubles and also averaged 14.1 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and a career-high 1.3 steals this season. He led the Magic to 52 wins, as they finished as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. They went on to lose to the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of 2011 NBA Playoffs. He had a playoff career-high 46 points and 19 rebounds in Orlando&#x27;s 103–93 loss to Atlanta in Game 1. Howard led the NBA in technical fouls with 18 in the regular season, and received one-game suspensions after his 16th and 18th technicals.

====Final season in Orlando (2011–2012)====
Due to a lockout, the 2011–12 regular season was shortened to 66 games. Not long after the lockout ended, Howard, who was eligible to become a free agent at the end of the season, demanded a trade to the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Lakers or Dallas Mavericks. Howard stated that although his preference was to remain in Orlando, he did not feel the Magic organization was doing enough to build a championship contender. He would later meet with Magic officials and agree to back off his trade demands, but stated that he also felt the team needed to make changes to the roster if they wanted to contend for a championship.
On January 12, 2012, Howard attempted an NBA regular season record 39 free throws against the Golden State Warriors. Howard entered the game making 42 percent of his free throws for the season and just below 60 percent for his career. The Warriors hacked Howard intentionally throughout the game, and he broke Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s regular-season record of 34 set in 1962. Howard made 21 of the 39 attempts, finishing with 45 points and 23 rebounds in the Magic&#x27;s 117–109 victory. On January 24, 2012, Howard became the Magic&#x27;s all-time scoring leader.

On March 15, 2012, on the day of the trading deadline for the 2011–12 NBA season, Howard waived his right to opt out of his contract at the end of the season and committed to stay with the Magic through the 2012–13 season. He had previously asked to be traded to the New Jersey Nets. Had he not signed the amendment, the Magic were prepared to trade him to avoid losing him as a free agent. On April 5, Van Gundy said that he had been informed by management that Howard wanted him fired. During the interview, the center walked up and hugged his coach, unaware that Van Gundy had confirmed a report that Howard denied. Van Gundy was let go after the season.

On April 19, 2012, Howard&#x27;s agent said that Howard would undergo surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back and would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. During the offseason, Howard again requested a trade to the Nets, who had relocated to Brooklyn. He intended to become a free agent at the end of the 2012–13 season if he was not traded to Brooklyn.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2012–2013)===

On August 10, 2012, Howard was traded from Orlando to the Los Angeles Lakers in a deal that also involved the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets. Howard took six months off from basketball after his April back surgery, and only had the combined four weeks of training camp and preseason to prepare for the season. Still working himself into shape, Howard paced himself throughout the season on both offense and defense. On January 4, 2013, Howard injured his right shoulder in the second half of the Lakers&#x27; 107–102 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. At the midpoint of the season, the Lakers were a disappointing 17–24. Howard was averaging 17.1 points on 58.2% shooting, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks, but also 3.6 fouls a game with 3.2 turnovers while making only 50.4% of his free throws.

Howard was upset that he was not getting the ball enough, and he felt that Kobe Bryant was shooting too much. Moving forward, Howard said he needed to &quot;bring it&quot; and dominate in more ways than just scoring. Howard missed games due to his recurring shoulder injury in January and February. In February, Bryant said that Howard &quot;worries too much&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t want to let anyone down&quot;, urging him to play through the pain when Pau Gasol was sidelined with a torn plantar fascia. Howard returned the next game after commenting that Bryant was &quot;not a doctor, I&#x27;m not a doctor. That&#x27;s his opinion.&quot;
During the All-Star break, Howard adopted a healthier diet to get into better shape to anchor the Lakers&#x27; defense and run head coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s preferred pick and rolls. Still, on February 23, Howard said he was &quot;not even close&quot; to physically being where he wanted to be. Coach Mike D&#x27;Antoni attributed Howard&#x27;s difficulty running the pick-and-roll—a play the coach had expected would be a staple for the team—with Steve Nash to Howard&#x27;s lack of conditioning. The Lakers were 8–2 after the All-Star break, passing Utah for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, and Howard averaged 15.5 points, 14.8 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks. In his first game back in Orlando on March 12, Howard scored a season-high 39 points and had 16 rebounds in a 106–97 Lakers win. Booed throughout the game, he made 25 of 39 free throws, setting franchise records for free throws made and attempted while tying his own NBA record for attempts. Howard made 16 of 20 free throws when he was fouled intentionally by the Magic. With Howard anchoring the Lakers defense and his improved overall play, the Lakers made the playoffs, but were swept in the opening round by San Antonio. Howard was ejected in Game 4 with over nine minutes left in the third quarter.

Howard finished the season with his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA, but he was the league leader in rebounding and ranked second in field goal percentage. Although he was recovering from his back surgery, he only missed six games all season—all due to his torn labrum. Howard was named to the All-NBA Third Team after having received five consecutive first-team honors. He became a free agent in the summer, and he was offered a maximum contract of five years and $118 million by the Lakers.

===Houston Rockets (2013–2016)===

On July 13, 2013, Howard signed with the Houston Rockets, joining James Harden to form a formidable duo. Howard finished the regular season with averages of 18.3 points and 12.2 rebounds and earned All-NBA Second Team honors. During the 2014 playoffs, Howard averaged 26 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Rockets were eliminated by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, losing the series 4–2.

After playing in the Rockets&#x27; first 10 out of 11 games to start the 2014–15 season, Howard missed 11 straight due to a strained right knee before returning to action on December 13 against the Denver Nuggets and recording his 10,000th career rebound. However, on January 31, Howard was ruled out for a further month due to persistent trouble with his right knee. After setbacks forced him out for a further month and a total of 26 games, Howard returned to action on March 25 against the New Orleans Pelicans. He started the game but was held under 17 minutes by coach Kevin McHale and finished with just four points and seven rebounds in a 95–93 win. Howard played only 41 games in the regular season. The Rockets clinched their first division title in over 20 years and made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost 4–1 to the Golden State Warriors.

On November 4, 2015, Howard had 23 points and 14 rebounds against the Orlando Magic. He shot 10-of-10 to become the first Rocket to make 10 or more field goals without a miss since Yao Ming went 12-of-12 in 2009. On December 26, he eclipsed 15,000 points for his career in a loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On January 18, 2016, in an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, Howard had 36 points and tied a career high with 26 rebounds en route to his 10th straight double-double, the league&#x27;s longest active streak at the time, and his longest since a 14-game run in 2012–13. On June 22, 2016, Howard declined his $23 million player option for the 2016–17 season and became an unrestricted free agent.

===Atlanta Hawks (2016–2017)===

On July 12, 2016, Howard signed a three-year, $70 million contract with his hometown team the Atlanta Hawks. With the retirement of Tim Duncan, Howard entered the 2016–17 season as the NBA&#x27;s active leader in rebounds (12,089) and blocked shots (1,916). In his debut for the Hawks in their season opener on October 27, Howard grabbed 19 rebounds in a 114–99 win over the Washington Wizards. It was the most rebounds for anyone in their Atlanta debut, breaking the mark of 18 that Shareef Abdur-Rahim set on October 30, 2001. On November 2, he scored a season-high 31 points in a 123–116 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 2, he had a season-best game with 24 points and 23 rebounds in a 113–108 win over the Rockets in Houston.

===Charlotte Hornets (2017–2018)===
On June 20, 2017, the Hawks traded Howard, along with the 31st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Marco Belinelli, Miles Plumlee and the 41st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. To begin the season, Howard became the first Charlotte player since Emeka Okafor in 2007 with four consecutive 15-rebound games. In the fifth game of the season, he had another 15-rebound game. On March 15, he scored 20 of his season-high 33 points in the second half of the Hornets&#x27; 129–117 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On March 21, Howard recorded 32 points and a franchise-record 30 rebounds in a 111–105 win over the Nets, becoming just the eighth player in league history with a 30–30 game. He became the first NBA player with a 30-point, 30-rebound game since Kevin Love in November 2010, and the first player with a 30–30 game against the Nets since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in February 1978. The next day, Howard was suspended for one game without pay due to receiving his 16th technical foul of the season. Howard finished the season with a franchise-record 53 double-doubles and joined Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players to hold single-season records with two teams. Howard also became one of six players to average a double-double in each of his first 13 seasons in the league.

On July 6, 2018, Howard was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Timofey Mozgov, the draft rights to Hamidou Diallo, a 2021 second-round draft pick and cash considerations. He was waived by the Nets immediately upon being acquired.

===Washington Wizards (2018–2019)===

On July 12, 2018, Howard signed with the Washington Wizards. He missed all of training camp, every exhibition game and the first seven regular-season games with a sore backside. He appeared in nine games in November before missing the rest of the season after undergoing spinal surgery to relieve pain in his glutes. In March 2019, it was revealed that Howard, in addition to his back injury, was also dealing with a hamstring issue. On April 18, 2019, Howard exercised his $5.6 million player option to play a second season with the Wizards.

On July 6, 2019, Howard was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for forward C. J. Miles. On August 24, 2019, Howard was waived by the Grizzlies.

===Second stint with the Lakers (2019–2020)===
On August 26, 2019, Howard signed a $2.6 million veteran&#x27;s minimum contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, reuniting him with his former team. He was replacing DeMarcus Cousins, a free agent signed earlier in the offseason who was lost for the year after suffering a knee injury. To assure the team that he would accept any role the team asked, Howard offered to sign a non-guaranteed contract, freeing the Lakers to cut him at any time.

During the season, the Lakers split time fairly evenly between him and starting center JaVale McGee. On January 13, 2020, Howard scored a season-high 21 points on a 9-of-11 shooting and got a season-high 15 rebounds. In Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against the Denver Nuggets, Lakers coach Frank Vogel started Howard to match up against the Nuggets&#x27; Nikola Jokić. Howard had 12 points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes to help the Lakers win and take a 3–1 lead in the series. He had started twice during the regular season, but this was his first start by coach&#x27;s decision when McGee was available. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals, winning the series 4–2 over the Miami Heat and giving Howard his first NBA championship.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2020–2021)===
On November 21, 2020, the Philadelphia 76ers signed Howard to a one-year deal worth $2,564,753. With the 76ers he averaged 7 points and 8.4 rebounds. Howard played 69 games with the Sixers with six starts in 17.3 minutes. He was suspended for one game after getting into a scuffle with Udonis Haslem where both were assessed technical fouls and Haslem was ejected. Howard was suspended because he incurred his 16th technical foul of the year. Despite winning the Atlantic division and the Eastern Conference regular season, in the Conference Semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, the 76ers would lose in seven games which included a squandered 26-point lead in Game 5.

===Third stint with the Lakers (2021–2022)===
Howard signed a $2.6 million veteran&#x27;s minimum contract with the Los Angeles Lakers on August 6, 2021. He averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds playing 60 games, starting 27 for the injury-ridden Anthony Davis. Despite one of the strongest rosters in the league, the Lakers, viewed by many as the premier championship contender, failed to make the playoffs, which was widely regarded by experts to be one of the greatest underachievements in NBA history.

===Taoyuan Leopards (2022–2023)===

Unable to secure a roster spot in the NBA, Howard signed with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League in Taiwan on November 7, 2022. While the league usually caps the salary of foreign players to US$200,000, it approved an exception for Howard, who would receive over $1 million. The league argued that Howard would raise the level of competition and boost the audience&#x27;s interest. On November 19, Howard made his Leopards debut, putting up 38 points, 25 rebounds, 9 assists, and 4 blocks in a 120–115 win over New Taipei CTBC DEA. However, just one day later, after playing his first two games back-to-back and nearly averaging a triple-double, Howard was sidelined with a knee injury until mid-December. Howard attributed this to playing over 90 minutes within 26 hours, which he was no longer used to. His knee injury resurfaced after playing another string of back-to-back games from December 16 to 17, causing him to sit out another two weeks and it was decided that in the future, Howard would mostly be used in home games to not further aggravate the injury.

In February 2023, Howard was named an All-Star for the T1 League as well as the All-Star Game Most Famous Player, and was also selected to participate in the Three-Point Contest. He scored 37 points and was named All-Star game MVP. He was the league&#x27;s rebounds leader for the 2022–23 season. On May 10, 2023, Howard was selected to the T1 League All-Defensive First Team in 2022–23 season. The next day, Howard was selected to the all-T1 League first team, and was awarded the Most Valuable Import of the T1 League for the 2022–23 season a day after that.

===Later years===
After the end of the season, Howard reportedly had talks about joining the Australian National Basketball League and expressed openness to play in the Philippine Basketball Association, but joined neither. On March 1, 2024, Howard briefly signed with the Mets de Guaynabo of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional, but never played for them.

Howard briefly played on several exhibition teams. He joined Strong Group for the Dubai International Basketball Championship in January 2024, where he helped secure a silver medal finish and on May 30, 2024, he joined the Taiwan Mustangs of The Asian Tournament (TAT).

==National team career==

On March 5, 2006, Howard was named to the 2006–2008 USA Basketball Men&#x27;s Senior National Team program. As the team&#x27;s regular starting center, he helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour, and subsequently helped the team win the bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. During the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, Howard was on the team which won its first nine games en route to qualifying for the finals and a spot for the 2008 Olympics. He started in eight of those nine games, averaging 8.9 ppg, 5.3 rpg and led the team in shooting .778 from the field. In the finals, he made all seven of his shots and scored 20 points as the USA defeated Argentina to win the gold medal.

On June 23, 2008, Howard was named as one of the members of the 12-man squad representing the United States in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. With Howard starting as center, Team USA won all of its games en route to the gold medal, restarting a streak of gold medals interrupted at the 2004 Olympics. Howard averaged 10.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game in the tournament.

==Player profile==
Standing and weighing , Howard plays the center position. He led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard&#x27;s rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten &quot;All things through Christ Phil: 4:13&quot;, a paraphrase of .

Howard&#x27;s abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan remarked in 2007, &quot;[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking.&quot; Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: &quot;[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn&#x27;t that gifted, as far as body and physical presence.&quot; After a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: &quot;It&#x27;s like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they&#x27;re going to have to change the rules.&quot; In December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard the most dominant center in the NBA. Early in his career, many sports pundits rated Howard one of the top young prospects in the NBA.

Howard has a reputation as a negative locker room presence. In a 2013 interview, he called his former Orlando Magic teammates a &quot;team full of people no one wanted&quot;. In a 2013 article titled &quot;Is Dwight Howard the NBA&#x27;s Worst Teammate?&quot;, &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; asserted that Howard had &quot;extinguished all bridges with the franchise where he spent his first eight NBA seasons&quot;. Howard did not get along with Kobe Bryant when he first played for the Lakers and did not get along with James Harden when he played for the Rockets. When he was traded from the Atlanta Hawks to the Charlotte Hornets, some of his Hawks teammates reportedly cheered. After Charlotte traded Howard to the Washington Wizards, Charlotte player Brendan Haywood asserted that Howard&#x27;s teammates were &quot;sick and tired of his act&quot;. In 2018, NBC News reported that &quot;Howard’s time with the Magic, Lakers and Rockets devolved into interpersonal strife well before he left those teams&quot;. Also in 2018, &quot;The Ringer&quot; published a piece titled &quot;Everybody (Still) Hates Dwight&quot; in which it called Howard &quot;almost certainly the least popular player in the NBA&quot;. Before signing with the Lakers in 2019, Howard reportedly met with the team multiple times, &quot;promising not to live up to his reputation as a difficult teammate who disrupts locker rooms&quot;; the team warned him that he would be released if he became a disruptive presence.

==Other media==
Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area.

Howard competed in season 6 of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Octopus&quot;. He was the first one to be eliminated during the two-night premiere alongside Vivica A. Fox as &quot;Mother Nature&quot; and Toni Braxton as &quot;Pufferfish&quot;.

Starting with 2004&#x27;s &quot;ESPN NBA 2K5&quot;, Howard appeared in every entry of the &quot;NBA 2K series&quot; of basketball simulation video games up until 2021&#x27;s &quot;NBA 2K22&quot;, totaling 18 entries and covering his entire NBA career. Similarly, he appeared in every &quot;NBA Live&quot; entry from 2004&#x27;s &quot;NBA Live 2005&quot; onwards until the series was canceled in 2018 following &quot;NBA Live 19&quot;, totaling 11 games. Additionally, he was the cover athlete of &quot;NBA Live 10&quot;. Furthermore, he appeared in multiple spin-off titles for both series, such as &quot;NBA Street V3&quot;, &quot;NBA Street Homecourt&quot;, &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, &quot;NBA Elite 11&quot;, &quot;NBA Playgrounds&quot;, and &quot;NBA 2K Playgrounds 2&quot;.

In 2011, he played himself on an episode of &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot; alongside fellow NBA players Deron Williams and Kevin Love.

During the 2014 Gaza war, Howard tweeted &quot;Free Palestine&quot;, but NBA commissioner Adam Silver immediately told him to remove the tweet and apologize.

In 2023, he finished third on &quot;Special Forces: World&#x27;s Toughest Test&quot;.

On September 4, 2024, Howard competed on the thirty-third season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Paired with Daniella Karagach, they were eliminated on November 12, during the show&#x27;s 500th episode.

==Personal life==
Howard has five children by five women. In 2010, Howard won a defamation judgment against Royce Reed, the mother of his oldest child Braylon. A Florida judge ruled that she violated a court order prohibiting her from mentioning Howard in the media. He had initially sought about half a billion dollars in damages, claiming that she had disparaged him through Twitter and her appearances on the reality television show &quot;Basketball Wives&quot;, as the couple&#x27;s paternity agreement stipulated a $500 fine for each time she mentioned him in public.

In October 2014, police in Cobb County, Georgia, investigated claims by Reed that Howard abused their son. Howard had admitted to hitting Braylon with a belt; he had been disciplined in the same manner while growing up, and he stated that he did not realize it was wrong to do so. Howard was not charged in connection with the allegations. Howard was also involved in a civil case with Reed over custody of their son.

Howard keeps approximately 20 snakes as pets and has appeared twice on Animal Planet&#x27;s reality TV series &quot;Tanked&quot;. He owns a farm &quot;in north Georgia where he relaxes [with] cows, hogs, turkeys and deer,&quot; and also grows vegetables on his estate in Suwanee, Georgia.

Melissa Rios, the mother of his son, David, died on March 27, 2020, following an epileptic seizure. David was with Howard at his home in Georgia at the time.

===Philanthropy, faith, and public image===
Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to &quot;raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world&quot;. He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy. Together with his parents, Howard established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work.

In 2014, Epix featured Howard as the focal point of a documentary about his life called &quot;In the Moment&quot;.

On his 37th birthday in 2022, Howard raised over NT$3 million (US$97,969) with a charitable auction. Items sold included collectible jerseys and pairs of shoes worn by Howard. The two charities were CountryEDU Charity Foundation and the Good Shepherd Social Welfare foundation. He also &quot;visited three schools on Wednesday and Thursday to interact and play basketball with the students, inspiring them to pursue their passion&quot;.

Howard appeared as a guest in the &quot;Taipei&quot; episode of Netflix docu-series &quot;Somebody Feed Phil&quot;, which aired in 2024. Dining with Philip Rosenthal, Howard discussed his charity work and the cultural shock he experienced upon moving to Taiwan. Simultaneously, he enjoyed Taiwanese and Hong Kong cuisine that he had never tried before, including foie gras and uni (sea urchin).

===Assault and battery allegation===
In July 2023, a man sued Howard for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment. The lawsuit stemmed from an encounter with the man at Howard&#x27;s Georgia residence in July 2021. The plaintiff alleged that Howard coerced him into a threesome with another man and forced himself sexually on the plaintiff. Howard denied the allegations and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed, stating that the two had engaged in &quot;consensual sexual activity&quot; and that the &quot;case had been made public for profit&quot;. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in August 2024.

<doc id="479277" wikidata="Q1365812" url="?curid=479277" title="Carl Gustaf 8.4 cm recoilless rifle">
<text>The Carl Gustaf 8.4 cm recoilless rifle (, named after &quot;Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori&quot;, which initially produced it) is a Swedish-developed caliber shoulder-fired recoilless rifle, initially developed by the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration during the second half of the 1940s as a crew-served man-portable infantry support gun for close-range multi-role anti-armour, anti-personnel, battlefield illumination, smoke screening and marking fire, which has seen great export success around the globe and continues to be a popular multi-purpose support weapon in use by many nations. The Carl Gustaf 84 mm recoilless rifle is a lightweight, low-cost weapon that uses a wide range of ammunition, which makes it extremely flexible and suitable for a wide variety of roles.

Development of the initial model started from 1946 as one of the many recoilless rifle designs of that era, based on the experience from the earlier Carl Gustaf 20 mm recoilless rifle and the success of man-portable rocket launchers during World War II, such as the bazooka and Panzerschreck. Production of the initial model was handled by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori led by Försvarets Fabriksverk (FFV) and the weapon received the designation &quot;8,4 cm granatgevär m/48&quot;, (&quot;8,4 cm grg m/48&quot; – &quot;8,4 cm grenade rifle&quot;, model 1948) in Swedish service. FFV would continue to further develop the weapon for the international market, later being merged into Saab Bofors Dynamics which handles development and export today. While similar weapons have generally disappeared from service, the Carl Gustaf is still in production and remains in widespread use.

== Name ==
The weapon goes under many names around the globe. It is most frequently called the &quot;Carl Gustaf&quot; or similar for short. British troops, for example, refer to it as the &quot;Charlie G&quot;, while Canadian troops often refer to it as &quot;Carl G&quot;. In Australia, it is irreverently known as &quot;Charlie Gutsache&quot; (guts ache, meaning stomach pain), or &quot;Charlie Swede&quot;.

In US military service, it is officially known as the &quot;M3 Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System&quot; (&quot;MAAWS&quot;) or &quot;Ranger Antitank Weapons System&quot; (&quot;RAWS&quot;), but is often simply called the &quot;M3 Carl Gustaf&quot; or just &quot;Gustaf&quot;.

In Swedish military service, it is officially known as the &quot;8,4 cm granatgevär m/48&quot;, &quot;m/86&quot; and &quot;m/18&quot;, depending on the model (M1, M3, M4), but is often simply referred to as the &quot;GRG&quot; (gé-er-gé) after their type designation abbreviation (from &quot;granatgevär&quot;, meaning &quot;grenade rifle&quot;), since all models fire the same general ammunition and are used in much the same way (although the &quot;84 mm grg m/18&quot; can use programmable and guided ammunition).

== Description ==

The basic weapon consists of the main tube with the breech-mounted Venturi recoil damper, with two grips near the front and a shoulder mount. The weapon is fitted with iron sights, but is normally aimed with the attached 3× optical sight with a 17 degree (300 mil) field of view. The most modern variants fielded by Swedish rifle companies have been fitted with the Swedish Aimpoint sighting system. Luminous front and rear sight inserts are available for the iron sights when aiming at night, and an image intensification system may also be used.

The Gustaf can be fired from the standing, kneeling, sitting or prone positions, and a bipod may be attached in front of the shoulder piece. An operating handle called the &quot;Venturi lock&quot; is used to move the hinged breech to one side for reloading.

=== Operation ===
The weapon is normally operated by a two-man crew, a gunner who carries and fires the weapon and a loader, carrying two canisters for a total of four rounds of ammunition. One or two extra ammunition carriers can be assigned if heavy use is expected.
In the firing procedure it is the loader&#x27;s responsibility to check the area behind the weapon for people and for obstacles that can interfere with the back-blast; this is needed due to the inherent dangers of the back-blast. Any person within the back-blast cone can suffer severe burn injuries and solid objects closely behind can reflect the blast back onto the crew.

=== Safety precautions ===

The overpressure, or blast wave, generated by the Gustaf will cause blast- and burn-related injuries to those behind the weapon, and is dangerous to and hazardous to about . Repeatedly firing the Gustaf can also cause related shock wave injuries to gunners and those nearby.

Gunners are only allowed to fire six rounds a day during training. The assistant gunners would also often move away from the overpressure zone, so that they too can fire six rounds a day. Sweden, the first user of Carl-Gustaf, has the regulation that gunner and assistant gunner are allowed to be exposed to 20 full-caliber rounds each day.

== Development history ==
=== 1946 – M1 in Sweden (8,4 cm grg m/48) ===
The Carl Gustaf M1 was developed around 1946 by Hugo Abramson and Harald Jentzen at the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration (&quot;Kungliga Arméförvaltningens Tygavdelning&quot;) and produced at Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori from where it derives its name. Development of the weapons system was preceded by a line of other recoilless developments between 1940 and 1946, featuring relatively small-bore ammunition:
*Carl Gustaf 20 mm recoilless rifle – 1942 (Swedish designation: 20 mm pansarvärnsgevär m/42)&lt;ref name=&quot;grg fm/43&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Carl Gustaf 37 mm recoilless rifle – 1943 (Swedish designation: 37 mm granatgevär fm/43)
*Carl Gustaf 47 mm recoilless rifle – 1945 (Swedish designation: 47 mm granatgevär fm/45)
*Carl Gustaf 84 mm recoilless rifle – 1948 (Swedish designation: 84 mm granatgevär m/48)

Despite advances in recoilless rifle technology introduced by the development family, it was quickly discovered that small-bore solid steel penetrators were obsolete for shoulder-fired antitank weapons, thus caliber was gradually increased to focus on multirole shell-type ammunition and the recent advances in shaped charge projectiles. By 1946 a caliber of 84 mm was decided upon (although larger calibers were proposed and tested).

The 84 mm weapon was first introduced into Swedish service in 1948 as the &quot;8,4 cm granatgevär m/48&quot;, filling a similar role as the US Army&#x27;s bazooka, British PIAT and German Panzerschreck, albeit with a higher focus on multirole and fire support than pure anti-tank warfare. Unlike the aforementioned weapons, however, the 84 mm Carl Gustaf used a rifled barrel for spin-stabilising its rounds, as opposed to fins used by the other systems. Sweden did, however, also adopt a true man-portable anti-tank system around the same time, the &quot;8 cm raketgevär m/49&quot; (fixed) and &quot;8 cm raketgevär m/51&quot; (foldable) rocket launchers, only featuring anti-tank ammunition.

The use of the recoilless firing system allowed the Gustaf to use ammunition containing considerably more propellant, firing its rounds at , as opposed to about for the Panzerschreck and bazooka and about for the PIAT. The result was superior accuracy at longer ranges. The Gustaf can be used to attack larger stationary targets at up to , but the relatively low speed of the projectile restricts attacks on moving targets to a range of or less.

The Gustaf was soon sold around the world and became one of the primary squad-level anti-tank weapons for many West European armies.
=== 1964 – M2 export ===
The Carl Gustaf M2 was introduced in 1964 as an improved, lighter and slightly shorter version of the original M1 for the export market. It quickly replaced the original version.

=== 1986 – M3 in Sweden (8,4 cm grg m/86) ===

The Carl Gustaf M3 started development in the 1980s and initially entered service with the Swedish Armed Forces as the 8,4 cm granatgevär m/86 (&quot;8,4 cm grenade rifle&quot;, model 1986). While similar to the export M3, it shares some spare parts with the original 1948 M1 model. It reduced the weight even further by replacing the forged steel tube with a thin steel liner containing the rifling, strengthened by a carbon fibre outer sleeve. The external steel parts were also replaced with plastics and aluminium alloys.

=== 1991 – M3 export ===
The current export Carl-Gustaf M3 version was introduced in 1991. In recent years, the M3 has found new life in a variety of roles. The British Special Air Service, United States Army Special Forces and United States Army Rangers use M3s in bunker-busting and anti-vehicle roles. Many armies continue to use it as a viable anti-armour weapon, especially against 1950s- and 1960s-era tanks and other armoured vehicles still in use worldwide.

=== 2011 – M3 in US (M3 MAAWS) ===
In the late 1980s, the US Army sought to replace the M67 recoilless rifle in use by the 75th Ranger Regiment. Testing by the army&#x27;s Benét Laboratories in 1993 determined that the Carl Gustaf M3 had a service lifetime more than four times the contractor&#x27;s claims, which drew interest from the US Navy, and a joint services team moved forward with a purchase order under the US military designation MAAWS (Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System) M3.

The MAAWS M3 is primarily used by United States Special Operations Command such as the Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Marine Raiders, Navy SEALs, and JSOC operators. When used by the Rangers, the M3 may be referred to as the Ranger Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System (RAAWS). Army Rangers found the M3 was best employed using a two-man team. One person would carry the launcher and be armed with a pistol for personal protection, and the other would carry 5–6 rounds of ammunition and act as a spotter for the gunner. Although the single-shot AT4 is lighter and can be carried by one person, a Gustaf team with the heavier recoilless rifle can reload and fire more rounds.

U.S. Army light infantry units began using the M3 MAAWS in Afghanistan in 2011, but only when commanders submitted operational needs statements for the weapon. The M3 became an official program of record in the conventional Army in 2014. Then in 2015, U.S. Army officials completed a conditional material release authorization, making the M3 Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System an organic weapon system within each infantry platoon.

The standard optic for the M3 MAAWS is a telescopic sight featuring 3x magnification and a 12-degree field of view. To enhance the M3&#x27;s targeting capabilities, the U.S. Army developed the Integrated Thermal Weapons Sight (ITWS) as an advanced system for the M3 MAAWS. The ITWS integrates the AN/PAS-13E Thermal Weapons Sight (TWS) and the AN/PSQ-23A Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Laser Range Finder. The thermal imaging capability of the AN/PAS-13E allows soldiers to detect and identify targets obscured by environmental factors such as darkness, fog, or dense vegetation, significantly improving situational awareness. While the AN/PSQ-23A STORM laser range finder ensures precise targeting by accurately calculating the distance to the target, thereby increasing hit probability. Despite these improvements, beginning in 2019, the U.S. Army opted to upgrade to the M3A1 MAAWS, which also has an advanced sight with an integrated laser range finder and a modular ballistic computer; however, the M3A1 offered further improvements over the ITWS, such as reduced weight and the ability to fire programmable ammunition.The M3 MAAWS fires the following ammunition:
* HE 441D RS: High explosive round with air burst capability containing 800 steel pellets and reduced sensitivity (RS) explosives
* HEDP 502 RS: High-explosive dual-purpose round that has impact and delay modes, with reduced sensitivity (RS) explosives
* HEAT 551: High-explosive anti-tank – rocket-assisted projectile
* HEAT 551C RS: High-explosive anti-tank – rocket-assisted projectile, with reduced sensitivity (RS) explosives
* TP 552: Target practice – rocket-assisted projectile
* HEAT 751: High-explosive anti-tank – rocket-assisted projectile, with tandem warhead to defeat ERA
* ADM 401: Area defense munition – ADM 401 has 1100 flechettes and ADM 401B has ball bearings
* ASM 509: Anti-structure munition (Thermobaric), with impact and delay modes
* MT 756: Multi-target – rocket-assisted projectile, with a tandem warhead to defeat buildings, bunkers, and light armor
* SMOKE 469B: Smoke round
* ILLUM 545C: Illumination round
* TPT 141: Target practice, tracer round
* SCA 553B: Adapter to fire 7.62 mm tracer ammunition for training

=== 2014 – M4 export ===

While the M3 MAAWS provided enhanced effectiveness over other launchers, its weight burdened troops. On 28 March 2013, USSOCOM announced a call for sources to develop a kit to lighten the weapon and reduce overall length without affecting handling or ruggedness. Saab was already developing a weight-reduced version that demonstrated no decrease in performance, no increase in recoil, and nearly equivalent barrel life that could be ready for testing in 2014. Saab also developed a high-explosive round that has a direct fire range of when using a fire control system.

Compared to the M3 MAAWS, the M4 is lighter at , and shorter with a overall length. The shorter length was in response to the need to wield the weapon in urban terrain, and weight savings were achieved through using lighter components whenever possible including a carbon fibre tube with titanium liner, and a new venturi design. Other new features include a red-dot sight, a travel safety catch to allow the M4 to be carried while loaded, an adjustable shoulder rest and forward grip for improved ergonomics, a shot counter to keep track of how many rounds have been fired to manage the weapon&#x27;s 1,000-round barrel life, double that of the M3, picatinny rails for grips and sight mounts, and a remote round management function so intelligent sights can communicate with programmable rounds.

In April 2019, a contract of SEK 168 million (US$18.1 million) was approved to supply the Australian Army with ammunition for the Carl-Gustaf M4 84 mm multipurpose weapon systems ordered by the service in September 2018.

=== 2017 – M4 in US (M3A1 MAAWS) ===
Following its reveal in 2014, the US Defense Department evaluated the M4 and in 2017 it was qualified for purchase by all US military services.
The US version of the M4 became known domestically as the M3A1 MAAWS. By using titanium, it is more than lighter than the 2014 M4 and is also shorter. It has an improved carrying handle, shoulder padding and a sighting system that can be adjusted for better comfort. The M3A1&#x27;s main sight is the Aimpoint FCS13RE, an advanced fire control system with an integrated laser rangefinder and a modular ballistic computer capable of programming high-explosive air-bursting ammunition (up to 1400 meters) and engaging moving targets (up to 600 meters). And in case of a malfunction with the primary sight, the M3A1 also has a backup reflex sight. The wiring harness provides a foregrip controller and programmable fuze setter for an interchangeable fire control system. The M3A1 uses the same family of ammunition as the M3. Testing with soldiers and SOF operators during live-fire exercises has demonstrated a hit rate of 90% or higher on both moving targets at 300 meters and stationary targets out to 850 meters, leading to a 60% increase in operational effectiveness compared to the older M3 MAAWS.

In 2017, the US Army ordered 1,111 units and the US Marine Corps planned to procure 1,200 to issue one to each infantry squad. The United States Marine Corps adopted the M3A1 to augment the Mk 153 SMAW in 2020 and it achieved Initial Operational Capability in 2021. In 2024, the US Army completed its fielding of the M3A1 Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS).

In October 2024, Aimpoint secured a contract to provide its FCS 14 sight to the U.S. Marine Corps to be the primary fire control system on the M3A1 MAAWS. This advanced fire control system features a direct-view, Dynamic Universal Reflex Sight, which has an integrated laser rangefinder and ballistic computer, delivering precise aiming points adjusted for range, munition type, terrain, and environmental factors. Designed for versatility, it operates effectively in bright daylight, dawn, or dusk conditions and can integrate with helmet-mounted night vision devices like the AN/PVS-14 or AN/PVS-31. The system also includes the Dual Sensor Afocal (DSA) module—a removable thermal and day camera unit with variable magnification settings of 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x, powered and controlled by the FCS—enhancing target detection and engagement capabilities.

=== 2018 – M4 in Sweden (8,4 cm grg m/18) ===
In 2018 the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (, &quot;FMV&quot;) signed a contract with Saab to purchase the Carl Gustaf M4 as the 8,4 cm granatgevär m/18 (&quot;8,4 cm grenade rifle&quot;, model 2018), often written without the &quot;m/&quot; to distinguish it from older m/18 (model 1918) systems (&quot;8,4 cm granatgevär 18&quot;, abbr. &quot;8,4 cm grg 18&quot;). The M4 will replace the old M1 models (&quot;8,4 cm grg m/48&quot;) models still in service as some units are pushing 70+ years in service. The 8,4 cm grg 18 will feature an advanced laser rangefinder and will be acquired with new programmable ammunition (preliminary name &quot;HE 448&quot;), and a new, improved HEAT shell.

=== 2024 – M4 in India ===
Saab announced in September 2022 that it would establish a manufacturing facility to produce the Carl-Gustaf M4 weapons system in India. It will be the company&#x27;s first facility producing the M4 system outside Sweden. The facility is expected to open in 2024 and will produce weapons for the Indian Armed Forces as well as export components to users worldwide. Saab received approval for 100% foreign direct investment and so will fully own the new manufacturing facility. The facility will also be India&#x27;s first fully foreign-owned defence manufacturing facility. Construction of the facility started on 4 March 2024. Previous versions of the Carl Gustaf system have been in service with India since 1976.

== Combat history ==
=== 1961–1964: Congo Crisis ===

As part of the Congo Crisis 1960–1965, Swedish troops were sent to Congo as ONUC peacekeepers in mid- to late 1960. They initially lacked any heavy weaponry, but due to rising threat levels they received tgb m/42 KP infantry fighting vehicles and heavy weaponry such as the M1 Carl Gustaf in time for the violent fighting in Elisabethville in 1961.

The weapon proved its worth as a man-portable multi-purpose weapon and came to great use during the conflict. One famous incident happened on 14 September 1961, when Swedish soldier Torsten Stålnacke, then part of a M1 Carl-Gustaf squad, had his two squadmates shocked in connection with repelling a Gendarmerie armoured car attack on a refugee camp and their nearby depot, forcing him to operate the M1 on his own. Stålnacke advanced by himself against an enemy firing position, meanwhile managing to take out an enemy armoured car and a number of enemies before his jaw was shot to pieces. His chin hung down to his chest and he was suffocating. With his fingers he cleared the throat from bone fragments and pulled the tongue up, thereby able to breath again. During the retreat, and with whistling bullets around him, Stålnacke kept his chin up with one hand and held the M1 with the other and managed with hand gestures and kicks get his two badly shocked comrades with him from the battlefield.

=== 2011–2021: War in Afghanistan ===

In November 2011, the US Army began ordering the M3 MAAWS for regular units deployed in Afghanistan. Soldiers were being engaged with RPGs at 900 meters, while their light weapons had effective ranges of 500–600 meters. The Gustaf allows airburst capability of troops in defilade out to 1,250 meters, and high-explosive use out to 1,300 meters.

In late 2012, the Army fielded 58 M3s and 1,500 rounds of ammunition to units deployed to Afghanistan to destroy enemy targets out to 1,000 meters. This was because RPG and machine gun teams could attack 900 meters away, while existing weaponry such as the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition, M72 LAW, M136 AT4, and MK153 SMAW have effective ranges of only 500 meters. The AT4 is lighter and cheaper but is made of reinforced fiberglass, while the M3&#x27;s rifled metal/carbon fiber launch tube allows for reloading. Employing the 22 lb M3 is easier than the 50 lb FGM-148 Javelin with its launcher with missile and reusable command launch unit, is faster than waiting on mortars, and is cheaper than the Javelin and artillery shells for engaging targets in hard cover. Although Special Operations forces had been using the M3 since the early 1990s, light infantry unit commanders in Afghanistan had to submit operational needs statements to get the weapon. The M3 MAAWS saw service with units such as the 25th Infantry, 10th Mountain, and 82nd Airborne divisions in Afghanistan. Later, the M3 MAAWS saw service with many other units across the U.S. Army when it became an organic weapon system for each infantry platoon in 2015.

=== 2022–: Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Since 2022, the Carl Gustaf has been used in combat in the Russian invasion of Ukraine by Ukrainian forces, being used to target both tanks and infantry. According to Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Defense, a Carl Gustaf was used to destroy the first Russian T-90M main battle tank of the war.

== Ammunition ==

The Carl Gustaf 84 mm recoilless gun fires a 84 × 245 mm rimmed recoilless (84×245R RCL) cartridge with a blowout base for propellant gas ventilation. Ammunition initially consisted of high-explosive (HE), high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), airburst (HE-TF) and smoke shells, not counting target-practice (TP) ammunition, but improvements to the ammunition family have been continual. While the older HEAT rounds are not particularly effective against modern tank armor, the weapon has found new life as a bunker-buster with a high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) round. Also, improved HEAT, high-explosive (HE), smoke and illumination (star shell or flare) ammunition is also available. For full effectiveness, illumination rounds must be fired at a very high angle, creating a danger for the gunner who can be burned from the backblast. For this reason, several armies have retired the illumination rounds, while the US Army requires that they be fired from a standing position. AEI Systems Ltd., a British defence products manufacturer, offers a variant of the platform dubbed the AE84-RCL designed to fire the M540/M550 line of 84×245 mm R ammunition manufactured in Belgium by Mecar.

The following are the Swedish manufacturer designations (other countries use similar terminology, replacing the FFV Försvarets Fabriksverk)
* FFV401 is an Area Defence Munition designed as a close-range anti-personnel round. It fires 1100 flechettes over a wide area. 
* FFV441 is an HE round, useful in a &quot;lobbed&quot; trajectory to 1,000 m, which can be fused to either detonate on impact or as an airburst.
* FFV441B is an HE round with an effective range against personnel in the open of 1,100 m. The round arms after 20 to 70 m of flight, weighs 3.1 kg, and is fired at a muzzle velocity of 255 m/s.
* FFV469 is a smoke round fired like the FFV441, with a range of about 1,300 m. The 3.1 kg round is also fired at 255 m/s.
* FFV502 is an HEDP round with the ability to be set to detonate on either impact or one-tenth second later. Effective range is 1,000 m against dispersed soft targets such as infantry in the open, 500 m against stationary targets and 300 m against moving targets. Minimum range is 15 to 40 m to arm the warhead. Penetration exceeds 150 mm of rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). Ammunition weight is 3.3 kg and muzzle velocity is 230 m/s.
* FFV509 is an ASM (Anti-Structure Munition), designed especially to destroy buildings and other types of urban constructions. The fuse has two modes: impact or a delayed function. The muzzle velocity is approximately 170 m/s and the maximum effective range is 300 meters.
* FFV545 is an illuminating star shell, fired up to 2,300 m maximum range, but with an effective envelope of 300 to 2,100 m. Suspended by parachute, the star shell burns for 30 seconds while producing 650,000 candela, providing a 400 to 500 m diameter area of illumination.
* FFV551 is the primary HEAT round and is a rocket-assisted projectile (RAP). Effective range is up to 700 m (400 m against moving targets) and penetration up to 400 mm of RHA. The ammunition weighs 3.2 kg and has a muzzle velocity of 255 m/s. After rocket ignition, the maximum velocity at 500 meters is 330 m/s.
* FFV551C RS is an evolution of FFV551, with improved Reduced Sensitivity (RS) munition properties and significant behind-armour effect. The ammunition weighs 3.5 kg and has a muzzle velocity of 245 m/s. After rocket ignition, the maximum velocity at 500 meters is 330 m/s. The maximum effective range is 700 meters and the armor penetration is about 400 mm.
* FFV552 is a practice round with the same ballistics as the 551.
* HEAT 655 CS (Confined Spaces) &quot;high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round that can be fired by the 84 mm Carl Gustaf recoilless weapon from within small enclosures.&quot;
* FFV751 is a tandem-warhead HEAT round with an effective range of 500 m and ability to penetrate more than 500 mm of armour. The round weighs 3.8 kg and has a muzzle velocity of 210m/s, while maximum velocity after rocket ignition is 336m/s.
* FFV756 is an MT (Multi Target) ammunition, designed for combat in built-up areas and for incapacitating an enemy under cover inside a building or some type of fortification. The MT 756 uses a tandem charge.
* Guided Multipurpose Munition (GMM) is a laser guided projectile developed between Saab and Raytheon, featuring a multipurpose warhead capable of defeating bunkers and moving light armored vehicles at a range of 2,500 m and can be fired from enclosed spaces.

<text>The basic unit of local government in Morocco is the commune. At the time of the 2014 population census, Morocco was divided into 1538 communes, 256 of which were classified as urban and also called municipalities. The remaining 1282 communes were classified as rural. Urban centres were defined by the High Commission for Planning for some rural communes. 

The following list includes all Moroccan municipalities with 50,000 or more inhabitants according to the 2014 census, as well as one urban centre of a rural commune whose population also exceeds 50,000 inhabitants. In its 2014 census report, the High Commission for Planning also published a list of the legal populations of seven major Moroccan cities, some of which comprise more than one administrative unit. Those legal population figures are incorporated into the list, and the city definitions they are based upon are provided in the notes.

<doc id="479316" wikidata="Q33791" url="?curid=479316" title="Pirogue">
<text>A pirogue ( or ), also called a piragua or piraga, is any of various small boats, particularly dugouts and canoes. The word is French and is derived from Spanish &quot;piragua&quot; , which comes from the Carib &quot;&quot;.

==Description==
The term &#x27;pirogue&#x27; does not refer to a specific kind of boat, but is a generic term for small boats in regions once colonized by France and Spain, particularly dugouts made from a log. In French West Africa, the term refers to handcrafted banana-shaped boats used by traditional fishermen. In Madagascar, it also includes the more elaborate Austronesian &quot;lakana&quot; outrigger canoe.

Pirogues are usually propelled by paddles that have one blade (as opposed to a kayak paddle, which has two). It can also be punted with a push pole in shallow water. Small sails are built by local fishermen and they can also be employed. There are two types of sails with differences in their shapes, the square one is used mainly for fishing near the coast and is only useful for tailwinds, while the triangular-shaped ones are used to transfer goods from one place to another by maintaining a bowline direction. Outboard motors are increasingly being used in many regions.

==Uses in military and piracy contexts==
There are accounts of 17th and 18th century Caribbean pirates using pirogues to attack and take by force much larger vessels including sloops and even barca-longas. Pirogues were used extensively by pirates and buccaneers throughout the Caribbean, the now-Mexican and Gulf Coasts and the East Coast of what is now the United States. For the most part, though, such vessels were used for scouting or as tenders.

Pirogues were used by Lewis and Clark on the Missouri River and westward from 1804–1806, in addition to bateaux, larger flat-bottomed boats that could only be used in large rivers. Their pirogues were medium-sized boats of the company carrying eight rowers and a pilot, capable of carrying eight tons of cargo. Henry D. Thoreau writes of using heavy pirogues in his book &quot;The Maine Woods&quot;.

==Louisiana==

Pirogues in the United States are associated particularly with the Cajuns of the Louisiana marsh. The early Creole pirogues were cypress dugouts but today they are usually flat-bottomed boats. Pirogues are not usually intended for overnight travel but are light and small enough to be easily taken onto land. The design also allows the pirogue to move through the very shallow water of marshes and be easily turned over to drain any water that may get into the boat. A pirogue has &quot;hard chines&quot; which means that instead of a smooth curve from the gunwales to the keel, there is often a flat bottom which meets the plane of the side.

In his 1952 classic song &quot;Jambalaya&quot;, Hank Williams refers to the pirogue in the line &quot;me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou&quot;. Johnny Horton, an avid Louisiana fisherman who celebrated Cajun customs and culture, also mentions pirogues in his 1956 song &quot;I Got a Hole in My Pirogue&quot;. Hank Williams, Jr. (son of the aforementioned Hank Williams) had a hit song in 1969 &quot;Cajun Baby&quot;, which refers to the pirogue in the line &quot;ride around in my old pirogue&quot;.

Doug Kershaw&#x27;s 1961 hit &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; includes the line &quot;he jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou&quot;. Many online lyrics sites misunderstand this line, saying &#x27;hero&#x27; or sometimes &#x27;biro&#x27; instead.

<text>The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World monkey species that is native to Japan. Colloquially, they are referred to as &quot;snow monkeys&quot; because some live in areas where snow covers the ground for months each year – no other non-human primate lives farther north, nor in a colder climate. Individuals have brownish grey fur, pinkish-red faces, and short tails. Two subspecies are known.

In Japan, the species is known as Nihonzaru (ニホンザル, a combination of &quot;Nihon&quot; 日本 &quot;Japan&quot; + &quot;saru&quot; 猿 &quot;monkey&quot;) to distinguish it from other primates, but the Japanese macaque is very familiar in Japan—as it is the only species of monkey in Japan—so when Japanese people simply say &quot;saru&quot;, they usually have the Japanese macaque in mind.

== Physical characteristics ==

The Japanese macaque is sexually dimorphic. Males weigh on average , while females average . Macaques from colder areas tend to weigh more than ones from warmer areas. The average height for males is , while the average female height is . The weight of their brain is approximately . Japanese macaques have short stumps for tails that average in males and in females. The macaque has a pinkish face and posterior. The rest of its body is covered in brown or greyish hair. The coat of the macaque is well-adapted to the cold and its thickness increases as temperatures decrease. The macaque can cope with temperatures as low as −20 °C (−4 °F).

Macaques mostly move on all fours. They are semiterrestrial, with females spending more time in the trees and males spending more time on the ground. Macaques are known to leap. They are very good swimmers and have been reported to swim a distance of more than half a kilometer. The lifespan of Japanese macaques is up to 32 years for females and up to 28 years for males, which is high when compared to what typically is seen in other macaque species.

== Behavior ==

=== Group structure ===

Japanese macaques live in matrilineal societies, and females stay in their natal groups for life, while males move out before they are sexually mature. Macaque groups tend to contain adults of both sexes. In addition, a Japanese macaque troop contains several matrilines. These matrilines may exist in a dominance hierarchy with all members of a specific group ranking over members of a lower-ranking group. Temporary all-male groups also exist, composed of those who have recently left their natal groups and are about to transfer to another group. However, many males spend ample time away from any group, and may leave and join several groups.

Females of the troop exist in a stable dominance hierarchy and a female&#x27;s rank depends on that of her mother. Younger females tend to rank higher than their older siblings. Higher-ranking matrilines have greater social cohesion. Strong relationships with dominant females can allow dominant males to retain their rank when they otherwise would not. Males within a group normally have a dominance hierarchy, with one male having alpha status. The dominance status of male macaques usually changes when a former alpha male leaves or dies. Other ways in which status of male hierarchy changes, is when an alpha male loses his rank or when a troop splits, leaving a new alpha male position open. The longer a male is in a troop, the higher his status is likely to be.

Females typically maintain both social relationships and hygiene through grooming. Grooming occurs regardless of climate or season. Females who are matrilineally related groom each other more often than unrelated individuals. Females will groom unrelated females to maintain group cohesion and social relationships between different kinships in a troop. Nevertheless, a female will only groom a limited number of other females, even if the group expands. Females will groom males, usually for hygienic purposes, but that behavior also may serve to attract dominant males to the group. Mothers pass their grooming techniques to their offspring, most probably through social rather than genetic means, as a cultural characteristic.

==== Documented female troop leadership ====
Yakei is a female who rose to leadership of her troop at Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden in 2021. Her troop consists of 677 Japanese macaque monkeys who live in a sanctuary that was established in 1952 at the zoological garden. At age nine, she overthrew the dominant males in her troop and displaced her high-ranking mother as well. She became the first female leader of the troop during its recorded history of seventy years. Yakei has retained her leadership position through her first breeding season that had been thought to be a time when she might have been challenged successfully. Both scientific and popular interest is leading to extensive coverage of Yakei&#x27;s behavior.

=== Mating and parenting ===

A male and female macaque form a pair bond and mate, feed, rest, and travel together during the mating season, and on average, this relationship typically lasts 16 days. Females enter into consortships with an average of four males a season. Higher-ranking males have longer consortships than their subordinates. In addition, higher-ranking males try to disrupt consortships of lower-ranking males. Females may choose to mate with males of any rank. However, dominant males mate more frequently than others, as they are more successful in mate guarding. The female decides whether mating takes place. In addition, a dominant position does not mean a male will successfully mate with a female. Males may join other troops temporarily during the mating season and mate with those females.

During the mating season, the face and genitalia of males redden and their tails stand erect, and the faces and anogenital regions of females turn scarlet. Macaques copulate both on the ground and in the trees. Roughly one in three copulations leads to ejaculation. Macaques signal when they are ready to mate by looking backward over a shoulder, staying still, or walking backward toward their potential partner. A female emits a &quot;squawk&quot;, a &quot;squeak&quot;, or produces an atonal &quot;cackle&quot; during copulation. Males have no copulatory vocalizations.

Females engage in same-sex mounting unrelated to the mating season and therefore, are mounted more often by other females than by males. This behavior has led to proposals in literature that female Japanese macaques are generally bisexual, rather than preferentially homo- or heterosexual.


A macaque mother moves to the periphery of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot, unless the group is moving, when the female must stay with it. Macaques usually give birth on the ground. Infants are born with dark-brown hair. A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members. The infants consume their first solid food at five to six weeks old, and by seven weeks, can forage independently from their mothers. A mother carries her infant on her belly for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother carries her infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year. The mother may socialize again very slowly. However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females who have not had infants of their own. Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; when they do, usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.

Infants have fully developed their locomotive abilities within three to four months. When an infant is seven months old, its mother discourages suckling; full weaning happens by its eighteenth month.

In some populations, male infants tend to play in larger groups more often than females. However, female infants have more social interaction than their male counterparts, and female infants will associate with individuals of all ages and sexes. When males are two years old, they prefer to associate with other males around the same age.

=== Communication ===
During feeding or moving, Japanese macaques often emit sounds that are called &quot;coos&quot;. These vocalizations most likely serve to keep the troop together and strengthen social relations among females. Macaques usually respond to coos with coos of their own. Coos also are uttered before grooming along with vocalizations identified as &quot;girney&quot; calls. Variants of the &quot;girney&quot; calls are made in different contexts. This call also serves as appeasement between individuals in aggressive encounters. Macaques have alarm calls for alerting to danger and other calls to signal estrus that sound similar to danger alerts. Threat calls are heard during aggressive encounters and are often uttered by supporters of those involved in antagonistic interactions. The individual being supported supports those callers in the future.

=== Intelligence and culture ===
The Japanese macaque is an intelligent species. Researchers studying this species at Koshima Island in Japan left sweet potatoes out on the beach for them to eat, then witnessed one female, named Imo (Japanese for yam or potato), washing the food off with river water rather than brushing it off as the others were doing, and later even dipping her clean food into salty seawater. After a while, other members of her troop started to copy her behavior. This trait was then passed on from generation to generation, until eventually all except the oldest members of the troop were washing their food and even seasoning it in the sea. Similarly, she was the first observed balling up wheat with air pockets and soil, throwing it all into the water, and waiting for the wheat to float back up free from the soil to consume it. An altered misaccount of this incident is the basis for the &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect. That behavior also spread among her troop members.

The macaque has other unusual behaviours, including bathing together in hot springs and rolling snowballs for fun. In winter, the bathing is associated with lower levels of stress, with the higher ranking females dominating the restricted resource to compensate for the higher rates of stress outside of the spring. Also, in recent studies, the Japanese macaque has been found to develop different accents, similar to human cultures. Macaques in areas separated by only a few hundred miles may have very different pitches in their calls, their form of communication. The Japanese macaque has been involved in many studies concerning neuroscience and also is used in drug testing.

== Ecology ==
The Japanese macaque is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn to early winter, macaques feed in between different activities. In the winter, macaques have two to four feeding bouts each day, with fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they have two or three bouts of feeding daily. In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities. Macaques usually sleep in trees, but they also sleep on the ground, as well as on or near rocks and fallen trees. During the winter, macaques huddle together for warmth on sleeping grounds. Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up after being encouraged to concentrate there in the 1960s, part of a plan to reduce local crop damage from foraging.

=== Diet ===
The Japanese macaque is omnivorous and eats a variety of foods. More than 213 species of plants are included in the macaque&#x27;s diet. They also eat insects, bark, and soil. On Yakushima Island, fruit, mature leaves, and fallen seeds are primarily eaten. The macaque also eats fungi, ferns, invertebrates, and other parts of plants. In addition, in Yakushima, their diets vary seasonally with fruits being eaten in the summer and herbs being eaten in the winter. Farther north, macaques mostly eat seasonal foods such as fruit and nuts to store fat for the winter, when food is scarce. On the northern island of Kinkasan, macaques mostly eat fallen seeds, herbs, young leaves, and fruits. When preferred food items are not available, macaques dig up underground plant parts (roots or rhizomes) or eat soil and fish.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Japanese macaque is the northernmost-living non-human primate. It is found on three of the four main Japanese islands, south of the Blakiston&#x27;s Line: Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The northernmost populations live on the Shimokita Peninsula, the northernmost point of Honshu. Several of Japan&#x27;s smaller islands are inhabited by macaques as well. The southernmost population living on Yakushima Island is a subspecies of the mainland macaques, &quot;M. fuscata yakui&quot;. A study in 1989 estimated the total population of wild Japanese macaques to be 114,431 individuals.

The Japanese macaque lives in a variety of habitats. It inhabits subtropical forests in the southern part of its range and subarctic forests in mountainous areas in the northern part of its range. It can be found in both warm and cool forests, such as the deciduous forests of central and northern Japan and the broadleaf evergreen forests in the southwest of the islands. Warm temperate evergreen and broadleaf forests and cool temperate deciduous broadleaf forests are the most important habitats for macaques.

In 1972, a troop of approximately 150 Japanese macaques was relocated from Kyoto to a primate observatory in southwest Texas, United States. The observatory is an enclosed ranch-style environment and the macaques have been allowed to roam with minimal human interference. At first, many perished in the unfamiliar habitat, which consists of arid brushland. The macaques eventually adapted to the environment, learned to avoid predators (such as eagles, coyotes, and rattlesnakes), and they learned to forage for mesquite beans, cactus fruits, and other foods. The surviving macaques flourished, and by 1995, the troop consisted of 500 to 600 individuals. In 1996, hunters maimed or killed four escaped macaques; as a result, legal restrictions were publicly clarified and funds were raised to establish a new sanctuary near Dilley, Texas. In 1999, the Animal Protection Institute took over management of the sanctuary and began to rescue other species of primates. As of 2017, the troop cohabitated with six other species of macaque.

== Relationship with humans ==
Traditional human behaviors that are threats to macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for construction and fuel, and hunting. Since World War II, these threats have declined due to social and economic changes in Japan, including the prohibition of macaque hunting in 1947. New threats have emerged, in particular the replacement of natural forests with lumber plantations. 

Protection for the macaques, increased afforestation, and the human-caused extinction of their natural predators the Japanese wolf, have led to the macaque population growing heavily since the 1940s. Because of this, and land-use changes increasing the proximity of agriculture to the macaques&#x27; range, they have become a major agricultural pest; they can climb over regular fences and quickly realise that deterrents such as scarecrows do not pose an actual threat, so methods such as electric fences must be used. In 2019, the cost of agricultural damage caused by macaques was around 900 million yen. Over 20,000 macaques are culled each year in an attempt to reduce agricultural damage, and there are concerns that this culling is reducing the macaques&#x27; range.

Macaques have often entered urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months. In 2022 the city of Yamaguchi experienced aggression from the monkeys with at least 50 people attacked.

=== Cultural depictions ===

The Japanese macaque has featured prominently in the religion, folklore, and art of Japan, as well as in proverbs and idiomatic expressions in the Japanese language.

In Shinto belief, mythical beasts known as &quot;raijū&quot; sometimes appeared as monkeys and kept Raijin, the god of lightning, company. The &quot;three wise monkeys&quot;, who warn people to &quot;see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil&quot;, are carved in relief over the door of the famous Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō.

The Japanese macaque is a feature of several fairy tales, such as the tale of &quot;Momotarō&quot; and the fable about &quot;The Crab and the Monkey&quot;.

The monkey is part of the Chinese zodiac. That zodiac has been used for centuries in Japan and led to many representations of the macaque for that figure.

The creature was sometimes portrayed in paintings of the rich cultural epoch, the Edo period that flourished from 1603 to 1867, as a tangible metaphor for a particular year. The early nineteenth-century artist and samurai, Watanabe Kazan (1793–1841), created a painting of a macaque. The last great master of the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock printing and painting, Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, also featured the macaques in his prints. Also during the Edo period, numerous clasps for &quot;kimono&quot; or tobacco pouches (collectively called &quot;netsuke&quot;) were carved in the shape of macaques.

Spoken references to macaques abound in the history of Japan. Originating from before his rise to power, the famed samurai, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was compared to a monkey in appearance and nicknamed &quot;Kozaru&quot; (&quot;Little Monkey&quot;). In modern Japanese culture, because monkeys are considered to indulge their libido openly and frequently (much the same way as rabbits are thought to in some Western cultures), a man who is preoccupied with sex might be compared to or metaphorically referred to as a monkey, as might a romantically involved couple who are exceptionally amorous.

<doc id="479320" wikidata="Q2655515" url="?curid=479320" title="Lee Eyerly">
<text>Lee Ulrich Eyerly (February 22, 1892 – March 23, 1963) was an American civil aviation pioneer and amusement ride manufacturer. Eyerly helped found Salem Oregon&#x27;s McNary Field, built the Flying E Ranch in Wickenburg, Arizona and invented several amusement park rides including the Loop-O-Plane, the Roll-O-Plane the Fly-O-Plane the Rock-O-Plane, and the Octopus.

==Early life==
Eyerly was born February 22, 1892 in Canton. In 1909, his family moved to the Judith Basin area of Montana to take advantage of the Homestead Act and Eyerly worked as a cowboy. Throughout his youth, Eyerly displayed an aptitude for mechanics and found work repairing broken farm equipment while building racing automobiles and small model airplanes for amusement. 

By 1919, Montana suffered from wind erosion and drought, and the opportunities for repairing farm equipment dwindled. Eyerly moved with his wife and children to Salem, Oregon, where he became a heavy-equipment operator, working on the state’s burgeoning system of roads. As automobiles became more popular, he opened a service station called &quot;The Grease Spot.&quot; In 1920, he paid $100 for flying lessons in a Jenny from local World War I pilot Elmer J. Cook and soloed after three hours – the only formal flying instruction he ever received.

==Career==
From a defunct carnival, Eyerly purchased a Curtis Canuck that he named &quot;Donnie Brook&quot; and began stunt-flying and barnstorming along the west coast. From 1923 to 1926, Eyerly and his family lived in Waldport, Oregon, where he also worked as a ferry operator and owned a tow boat business. In 1926, they moved back to Salem, and he purchased a small Waco mail bi-plane.

In 1927, with bond funds raised by the American Legion, Eyerly purchased a five-acre (20,000 m2) site on one end of the local fairgrounds on which he established a dirt runway, built airplane hangars and founded the Pacific Airplane Service. The airport would eventually evolve into Salem&#x27;s municipal McNary Field. It was dedicated in 1929 with Eyerly as the airport manager. By 1929, he had founded an aviation school, and later, the first aircraft service station on the west coast. 

When the Great Depression hit, he devised an inexpensive plane and pilot trainer and founded the Eyerly Aircraft Company to manufacture them. The first was the Whiffle Hen, a plane which only burned two US gallons (8 L) of fuel per hour of flight. The second was a ground-based flight training device patented under the name &quot;Orientator&quot;. The Orientator consisted of a small airplane suspended in what looked like the tines of a giant tuning fork. Air from the electrically driven propeller passed over the wings and rudder, and the operator controlled the movements of the plane in a manner similar to a real aircraft.

The Orientator was produced commercially and five were purchased by the Cuban government. When the Orientator became popular with visitors at state fairs and carnivals, and Eyerly realized the Orientator was more profitable as an amusement park ride. It was renamed the Acroplane and 54 were subsequently produced. Eyerly changed his company&#x27;s focus from aircraft to amusement rides.

Eyerly developed and patented numerous amusement rides which would become staples of carnival midways, including The Loop-O-Plane (1933), the Roll-O-Plane, the Fly-O-Plane and the Rock-O-Plane (1948). His most popular design was the Octopus, of which almost 400 were sold, and resulted in later variations: the Spider and the Monster. Two of his kiddie carousel rides were the Midge-O-Racer and Bulgy the Whale.

Although Eyerly’s manufacturing business became amusement rides, the name of his company remained Eyerly Aircraft and he maintained his interest in aeronautics. He served on the Oregon Aeronautics Board from the 1920s to 1958, including ten years as its chair. In 2001, Eyerly was named the third inductee into the Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame.

Eyerly married Meta H. Wieglenda (1893-1989) on June 22, 1913 in Hobson, Montana. The couple raised two sons and two daughters.

Eyerly twice crashed in an airplane. In 1929, he crashed nose down into the ground while performing in a stunt contest during an air derby in Eugene, Oregon. He suffered a cerebral concussion, fractured right arm, and contusions of the shoulder, neck, back and right hip. Eyerly said he was at fault for violating some fundamentals of flying. The second time he was forced to ditch his plane in the San Francisco Bay when the engine quit on a foggy night. He and his three passengers were picked up by a ferry boat.

Eyerly died of cancer on March 23, 1963, in Salem, Oregon.

<text>In computing, specifically in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a raw device is a special kind of logical device associated with a character device file that allows a storage device such as a hard disk drive to be accessed directly, bypassing the operating system&#x27;s caches and buffers (although the hardware caches might still be used). Applications like a database management system can use raw devices directly, enabling them to manage how data is cached, rather than deferring this task to the operating system.

In FreeBSD, all device files are in fact raw devices. Support for non-raw devices was removed in FreeBSD 4.0 in order to simplify buffer management and increase scalability and performance.

In Linux, opening a block device with the flag replaces raw device usage. Raw devices were removed entirely from the Linux kernel in the 5.14 release.

<doc id="479334" wikidata="Q1671993" url="?curid=479334" title="Ion (window manager)">
<text>In Unix computing, Ion is a tiling and tabbing window manager for the X Window System. It is designed such that it is possible to manage windows using only a keyboard, without needing a mouse. It is the successor of PWM and is written by the same author, Tuomo Valkonen. Since the first release of Ion in the summer 2000, similar alternative window management ideas have begun to show in other new window managers: Larswm, ratpoison, StumpWM, wmii, xmonad and dwm.

First versions of Ion were released under the Artistic License, Ion2 and the development versions of Ion3 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). However, the first release candidate of Ion3 included a license change to a custom license based on the LGPL (specifically modified versions must not use the name ion).

Since version 2, Ion has been scriptable in Lua.

As of September 17, 2009, Valkonen states he is unlikely to continue development of Ion by himself.

The official home page went offline in early 2010.

A fork, Notion (Not-ion), is being maintained.

==Alternatives==
The Notion (Not-ion) fork is actively maintained with packages available for the Linux distributions gentoo, Debian, Arch, SUSE and Fedora as well as NetBSD and Solaris (Solaris 10, OpenSolaris and OpenIndiana).

Window managers similar to ion include awesome, dwm, i3, larswm, and xmonad.

==Controversy==

Tuomo Valkonen, the author of Ion, has been at the center of several controversies concerning the licensing and distribution of his software, in particular the proclivity of major Linux and BSD distributions of making outdated development versions of Ion3 (the current unstable development branch) available as part of &quot;frozen&quot; software repositories. Often, such versions will include patches, such as for Xinerama or Xft support, both of which Valkonen disapproves on professional and personal grounds and has had removed from the main source tree. Yet, such distribution would seem to imply that the patched version is the official Ion3 package maintained by Valkonen himself, which he sees as unacceptable. Valkonen has even recently become an outspoken critic of the entire free software and open-source movement (the &quot;FOSS herd&quot;, as he refers to it) due to his perceived mistreatment at the hands of several major distributions, including Arch Linux, Debian, pkgsrc (NetBSD, DragonflyBSD), and FreeBSD.

On April 28, 2007, Valkonen warned the Arch Linux maintainers of possible legal action because the (unofficial) Arch User Repository contained scripts to install Ion3 with patches he did not approve of. Later on he did the same with the pkgsrc maintainer of the NetBSD project and the ports maintainer of the FreeBSD project. As of December 12, 2007, the development branch of Ion, along with other software by Valkonen, was pulled from the FreeBSD ports tree, after the author filed a complaint about outdated development releases still being available. Any version of Ion may still be installed from source code on any Unix system with proper libraries and dependencies.

Valkonen has implied in several mailing lists that he has become completely disillusioned with, if not openly hostile toward, the free software community in general. He plans to switch to developing strictly closed-source software for the Windows platform in the future. As of 2018, the author claims to have &quot;found more worthwhile hobbies&quot; than programming for the &quot;Free Software movement&quot;, opining that it amounts to &quot;bug-ridden clone[s] ... with a centralised software distribution mechanism&quot;. Borgend, Valkonen&#x27;s latest published program as of 2018, remains open-source and is compatible with Unix-like systems, including Macintosh OS X, his present operating system of choice.

<doc id="479336" wikidata="Q1085180" url="?curid=479336" title="Winchester Model 1897">
<text>The Winchester Model 1897, also known as the Model 97, M97, Riot Gun, or Trench Gun, is a pump-action shotgun with an external hammer and tube magazine manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The Model 1897 was an evolution of the Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a solid frame or takedown. The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of , while 12-gauge guns were furnished with barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as or as long as . Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured, it has been used to great effect by American military personnel, law enforcement officers, and hunters.

==History==
The Winchester Model 1897 was designed by American firearms inventor John Moses Browning. The Model 1897 was first listed for sale in the November 1897 Winchester catalog as a 12 gauge solid frame. The 12 gauge takedown model was added in October 1898, and the 16 gauge takedown model in February 1900. Originally produced as a tougher, stronger and more improved version of the Winchester Model 1893, itself an improvement on the early Spencer 1882 pump-action shotgun, the 1897 was identical to its forerunner, except that the receiver was thicker and allowed for use of smokeless powder shells, which were not common at the time. The 1897 introduced a &quot;take down&quot; design, where the barrel and magazine tube could easily be separated from the receiver for cleaning or transportation, the ease of removal of the barrel becoming a standard in pump shotguns made today, like the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 series. Over time, &quot;the model 97 became the most popular shotgun on the American market and established a standard of performance by which other kinds and makes of shotguns were judged, including the most expensive imported articles&quot;. The Winchester Model 1897 was in production from 1897 until 1957. It was in this time frame that the &quot;modern&quot; hammerless designs became common, like the Winchester Model 1912, the Ithaca Model 1937, and the Remington 870. The Model 1897 was superseded by the Winchester Model 1912. However, the gun can still be found today in regular use.

===Improvements from the 1893===
While designing the new Model 1897, many of the weaknesses present in the earlier Model 1893 were taken into account and remedied. These improvements included:

* The frame was strengthened and made longer to handle the newer smokeless powder 12 gauge inch shell, as well as the older and shorter black powder inch shell.
* The top of the frame was covered so that the ejection of the fired shell was entirely from the side. This added a lot of strength to the frame of the gun and it allowed the use of a inch shell without the danger of the gun constantly jamming.
* The action could not be opened until a slight forward movement of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled the immediate opening of the action. In the absence of any recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.
* A movable cartridge guide was placed on the right side of the carrier block to prevent the escape of the shell when the shotgun was turned sideways in the act of loading.
* The stock was made longer and with less drop.

Of these improvements, the slide lock is the one that made the Model 1897 into a safe firearm. This improved slide lock kept the shotgun locked until actual firing occurred which prevented it from jamming in the case of a misfire. The slide lock &quot;stands in such a relation to the body of the firing pin as will prevent the firing pin reaching the primer until the pin has moved forward a sufficient distance to insure locking of the breech bolt&quot;. This prevents the action sleeve &quot;from being retracted by the hand of the gunner until after firing, and hence rendering the firearm more safe&quot;.

==Description==
The Winchester Model 1897 and the Winchester Model 1893 were both designed by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun that is lacking a trigger disconnector. This means that the user can hold the trigger down while cycling the shotgun and once the action is returned to battery the shotgun fires. The firearm itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun. It was the first truly successful pump-action shotgun produced. Throughout the time period the Model 1897 was in production, over a million of the type were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of , while 12-gauge guns were furnished with length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as , and as long as . Along with various grades and barrel lengths, the Model 1897 came in two different chamberings. One was the 12 gauge and the other was the 16 gauge. The shells should be of the inch or inch models. Any shells larger are not recommended. An average Model 1897 can hold 5 or 6 shotgun shells in the magazine tube. When working the action of the Model 1897 the forend (fore grip) is pulled back, forcing the breech bolt to the rear which extracts and then ejects the spent shell while simultaneously cocking the external hammer by pushing it to the rear. When the forend is slid forward again, the breech bolt pushes a fresh shell into the gun&#x27;s chamber and locks into place.

The Chinese company Norinco has made an effort to reproduce this firearm. The Norinco 97 is an almost exact copy of the Winchester 1897, produced in both Trench and Riot grades, yet lacking in the fit and finish of the originals.

===Grades of the Model 97===

===Original prices===
When the Model 1897 was first introduced, the price depended upon what grade was being purchased and what features were being added to that specific shotgun. To purchase a plain finished shotgun would cost the buyer $25, whereas an engraved receiver with checkered and finer wood included cost $100. The more expensive grades of the Model 1897 were the standard, trap, pigeon, and tournament grades. These were the grades that were normally equipped with an engraved receiver and with checkered, finer wood. The less expensive and plainer grades were the Brush, Brush Takedown, Riot, and Trench. These grades were not given the higher valued wood or special designs. This is because these guns were designed and built for hard abuse. These grades stood a higher chance of being badly damaged so there was no need to put extra money into them for appearance purposes. As the functions that were performed with these grades required them to be lightweight, it was not beneficial to use heavy and expensive wood when designing them. Most often, when these grades were purchased, they were purchased in high numbers. By designing these grades with standard wood and finish, it kept the prices at a lower level. They were also sold in German catalogues for prices comparable to luxury double-barreled shotguns.

==Military use==
The Model 1897 was issued to American soldiers during the Philippine–American War of 1899. This first major use of issued shotguns by the United States military involved 200 weapons procured and sent to the Philippines in 1900. They were employed in countering Moro tribesmen who engaged the Americans in close-quarter combat using knives and swords. (&quot;See: juramentado&quot;)
During the punitive expedition in Mexico, some US soldiers were also equipped with M97s. When the United States entered World War I, there was a need for more service weapons to be issued to the troops. It became clear to the United States just how brutal trench warfare was, and how great the need was for a large amount of close-range firepower while fighting in a trench, after they had observed the war for the first three years. The Model 1897 Trench grade was an evolution of this idea. The pre-existing Winchester Model 1897 was modified by adding a perforated steel heat shield over the barrel which kept the soldier&#x27;s hands off a hot barrel, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing an M1917 bayonet.
This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20-inch cylinder bore barrel. Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war. Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 (.33-caliber) buckshot pellets. This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired.

It has been said that American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades in midair.

Unlike most modern pump-action shotguns, the Winchester Model 1897 (versions of which were type classified as the Model 97 or M97 for short) fired each time the action closed with the trigger depressed (that is, it lacks a trigger disconnector). Coupled with its five-shot capacity, this made it effective for close combat, such that troops referred to it as a &quot;trench sweeper&quot;. This characteristic allowed troops to fire the whole magazine with great speed, known as &quot;slam firing&quot;. Shortly before the end of the war, the German government protested the use of shotguns in combat, claiming it to cause unnecessary suffering. The Model 1897 was used again in World War II by the United States Army and Marine Corps, where it was used alongside the similarly militarized version of the hammerless Model 1912. Some were still in service during the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

===World War I protests===
The Model 1897 was popular with American troops in World War I, and the Germans soon began to protest its use in combat. &quot;On 19 September 1918, the German government issued a diplomatic protest against the American use of shotguns, alleging that the shotgun was prohibited by the law of war.&quot; A part of the German protest read that &quot;[i]t is especially forbidden to employ arms, projections, or materials calculated to cause unnecessary suffering&quot; as defined in the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare. This is the only known occasion in which the legality of actual combat use of the shotgun has been raised. However, the United States interpreted its use of the shotgun differently than Germany. The Judge Advocate General of the Army, Secretary of State Robert Lansing, promptly rejected the German protest. France and Britain had double-barreled shotguns available for use as trench warfare weapons during World War I; however, unable to obtain high-powered ammunition and judging reload speed too slow for close combat, these countries did not field them.

In their initial protest, Germany threatened the execution of any POW caught with a shotgun or ammunition thereof. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to reprisals by the United States. However, Tom Laemlein, in his article entitled &quot;The Trouble with Trench Guns&quot; noted that &quot;there are no photos [online or not] of trench guns in combat [during World War I]. None.&quot; He believed that in spite of retaliation threats, the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) ordered that photos of trench guns in combat be censored, and ultimately eliminated to prevent leaking among the press that would give Germany a reason to portray U.S. troops as &quot;undisciplined and barbaric&quot; and &quot;incapable of using proper rifles.&quot; Another reason is that there were also seemingly concerns by General John J. Pershing and his staff that French and British commanders might exert control of American forces over public relations with the combat use of trench guns, as America was considered a junior partner among the Entente Powers. Laemlein concluded that &quot;[t]he trench guns would remain in France and continue to do their deadly, effective work, but there would simply be no photographs allowed to document it.&quot;

==Other uses==
After the war, a shorter-barrelled version of the Model 1897 was marketed by Winchester as a riot gun. Messengers of The American Express Company were armed with this weapon as were various police departments throughout the US. The differences between this riot version and the trench version were that the riot version lacked the heat shield and bayonet lug, and all trench guns were equipped with sling swivels, whereas most riot guns were not.

<text>Mozilla Sunbird is a discontinued free and open-source, cross-platform calendar application that was developed by the Mozilla Foundation, Sun Microsystems and many volunteers. Mozilla Sunbird was described as &quot;a cross platform standalone calendar application based on Mozilla&#x27;s XUL user interface language&quot;. Announced in July 2003, Sunbird was a standalone version of the Mozilla Calendar Project.

It was developed as a standalone version of the Lightning calendar and scheduling extension for the Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey mail clients. Development of Sunbird was ended with release 1.0 beta 1 to focus on development of Mozilla Lightning. The latest development version of Sunbird remains 1.0b1 from January 2010, and no later version has been announced. Unlike Lightning, Sunbird no longer receives updates to its time zone database.

==Sun contributions==
Sun Microsystems contributed significantly to the Lightning extension project to provide users with a free and open-source alternative to Microsoft Office by combining OpenOffice.org and Thunderbird/Lightning. Sun&#x27;s key focus areas in addition to general bug fixing were calendar views, team/collaboration features and support for the Sun Java System Calendar Server. Since both projects share the same code base, any contribution to one is a direct contribution to the other.

==Trademark issues and Iceowl==

Although it is released under a MPL, MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license, there are trademark restrictions in place on Mozilla Sunbird which prevent the distribution of modified versions with the Mozilla branding.

As a result, the Debian project created Iceowl, a virtually identical version without the branding restrictions.

<text>Works Volume 1 is the fifth studio album by English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released as a double album on 25 March 1977 on Atlantic Records. Following their world tour supporting &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; (1973), the group took an extended break before they reconvened in 1976 to record a new album. They were now tax exiles and recorded new material in London and overseas in Montreux, Switzerland and Paris, France. &quot;Works Volume 1&quot; features a side dedicated for each member to write and arrange their own tracks, while the fourth side features songs performed collectively. Keith Emerson recorded his Piano Concerto No. 1, Greg Lake wrote several songs with lyricist Peter Sinfield, and Carl Palmer recorded tracks of varied musical styles.

The album peaked at No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went gold in both countries, the latter for 500,000 copies sold. The group track &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;, Emerson&#x27;s adaptation of the 1942 composition by Aaron Copland, was released as a single in May 1977. It went to No. 2 on the UK singles chart to become the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the UK. Additional material recorded in 1976, plus songs from previous studio sessions, were released as &quot;Works Volume 2&quot;. Both albums were supported with the 1977–1978 tour, which featured the band playing with an orchestra on stage for some early shows.

==Background==
In August 1974, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer finished their ten-month world tour in support of their fourth album, &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; (1973). This was followed by the triple live album &quot;Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ～ Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; (1974) which earned the group their highest charting position in the US with a peak of No. 4, and No. 6 in the UK. The trio took an extended break, having been on the recording and touring circuit each year since their formation in 1970. Keith Emerson said that at this point in their career, the group&#x27;s musical direction had been &quot;milked dry&quot; and they wanted to spend time planning their next step.

In 1976, the three had decided to start on a new studio album and became tax exiles, meaning they had to record overseas. Lake recalled that this was an unpopular opinion as the members had family based in England. They settled in Montreux, Switzerland where they recorded at Mountain Studios. Lake recalled his time there was difficult for creativity: &quot;It&#x27;s so grey. There&#x27;s nothing there. You get sod-all inspiration!&quot; Emerson supported his view and called it &quot;the end of the earth&quot;, but he and Palmer praised the studio facilities and the quality of the equipment.

Lyricist Pete Sinfield has claimed credit for the album&#x27;s title, explaining, &quot;I suppose if you&#x27;re gonna be pretentious, you might as well do it big. They had all these bits floating around. But &#x27;Bits&#x27; didn&#x27;t really sound right.&quot;

For &quot;Works&quot;, Lake wanted to take a more serious approach in writing and singing ballads, and felt singing with an orchestra added greater variety to his songs. Both tracks on side four feature Emerson playing a Yamaha GX-1 synthesizer.

In March 1977, Lake said that the band had completed additional material that would be released on &quot;Works Volume 2&quot;.

==Music==
===Sides one to three===
Side one features Emerson&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1, a three-movement work for piano and orchestra. Emerson performs on a Steinway grand piano with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Mayer, who assisted on the orchestral arrangements. He wanted to write a serious piece that would not date itself, with the aim of having it performed by others in the future. Working hard on the score, Emerson looked back on it shortly after the album was released: &quot;I&#x27;ve squeezed every ounce of myself into that thing. And I feel very satisfied.&quot; An initial recording session took place at Kingsway Hall in London with mobile studio equipment, but the orchestra had difficulty understanding the score and performers complained of the hall&#x27;s acoustics, resulting in Emerson &quot;wasting a lot of money.&quot; A successful session arose when recording relocated to De Lane Lea Studios. When it came to preparing material for the album, Emerson dedicated a period to &quot;think and write&quot; following his depression after his Sussex home caught fire two years prior, burning his possessions and music he had put down. The work&#x27;s third movement reflected Emerson&#x27;s mood at the time of the fire, and he was able to get &quot;a lot of anger&quot; out through the music. In the band&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Beginning&quot; documentary, Lake recalled that Emerson invited composer Leonard Bernstein to listen to the work during his visit to the Paris studio where the recording was being mixed. Upon listening to the work, Bernstein said it &quot;reminded him of Grandma Moses&quot;, a folk artist. Emerson, however, did not recall Bernstein saying this.

Side 2 is the Greg Lake side, and consists of acoustic ballads, all of which were written by Lake and Peter Sinfield.

Side 3, the Carl Palmer side, includes a remake of &quot;Tank&quot; from the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album released in 1970, with orchestral accompaniment and minus the drum solo. &quot;L.A. Nights&quot; features Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh on lead and slide guitar and scat vocals. Two arrangements of classical pieces are included: Two-Part Invention in D minor, BWV 775 by Johann Sebastian Bach and a piece titled &quot;The Enemy God Dances With the Black Spirits&quot;, an excerpt of the 2nd movement of the &quot;Scythian Suite&quot; by Sergei Prokofiev.

===Side four===
The fourth side features two group-performed pieces. &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; is an adaptation of the same-titled piece by American composer Aaron Copland. Emerson sought Copland&#x27;s permission so the group could use it; Copland found their version appealing but was puzzled at the solo section in the middle of two fairly straightforward renditions of his piece.

The 13-minute &quot;Pirates&quot; originated from a piece Emerson had written for a cancelled film version of Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s book &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;. When Lake and Sinfield got together to write lyrics for the track, Emerson had told Lake that he wrote it with mercenaries in mind, which Lake found distasteful and wanted the song to be about something else. He conjured images of the sea upon listening to Emerson&#x27;s piece, which made him think of pirates. Sinfield liked the idea, and the pair wrote words at Lake&#x27;s mountain chalet. &quot;Pirates&quot; was recorded in two separate studios; Lake had a falling out with the orchestra used in Montreux, so recording moved to Paris with the National Opera of Paris orchestra and conductor Godfrey Salmon. Sinfeld recalled the band wanting Leonard Bernstein to conduct the orchestral arrangements on &quot;Pirates&quot;, and arranged for Bernstein, who was conducting at the nearby Opera House, to visit the studio and hear the piece. Lake said: &quot;I pressed the play button, and he put his head in his hands and from beginning to end, he didn&#x27;t move [...] If he didn&#x27;t like something, you would be told [...] he looked at me, and he said, &#x27;The singing&#x27;s not bad.&#x27; [...] I&#x27;m sure he didn&#x27;t realize that I was the singer&quot;. Sinfield remembered Bernstein describing it as &quot;primitive&quot;.

==Reception==
The album was originally released just as the punk era was getting underway, when bands like ELP were perceived as bloated &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. As a result, &quot;Works Volume 1&quot; received mixed-to-poor reviews and is often viewed as marking the start of an artistic downturn in the group&#x27;s career, despite the great success of &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; as a single. In a contemporary review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; did not care for either the Emerson or Lake sides but liked Palmer&#x27;s selections, and reserved high praise for the two group numbers on side four. 

AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review is mixed. They also criticize the solo sides of Keith Emerson (&quot;on the level of a good music-student piece, without much original language&quot;) and Greg Lake (C&#x27;est la Vie&#x27;, the featured single, says little that &#x27;Still...You Turn Me On&#x27;, from their previous album, didn&#x27;t say better and shorter&quot;). They offer some praise for the Carl Palmer and group sides, but conclude that the group songs &quot;cover a lot of old ground, albeit in ornate and stylish fashion.&quot; Paul Stump&#x27;s 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; characterized the album as excessive, indulgent, and &quot;clodhoppingly stereotypical&quot;, but also asserted that it &quot;is not without merit&quot;. In particular, he argued that while doing a piano concerto is a pompous and indulgent idea, Emerson pulls it off reasonably well, and his impressive virtuosity fits more comfortably in this context than in Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s rock workouts.

<doc id="479363" wikidata="Q10524" url="?curid=479363" title="Ryan Giggs">
<text>Ryan Joseph Giggs (né Wilson; born 29 November 1973) is a Welsh football coach, former player and co-owner of Salford City. He is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation, and one of the best wingers in the history of football. Giggs spent his entire professional career at Manchester United, where he also served as the club&#x27;s interim player-manager and assistant manager. He is one of the most decorated footballers of all time, and is one of only 51 players to have made over 1,000 career appearances.

The son of rugby union and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs was born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton RLFC. Predominantly a left midfielder, he began his career with Manchester City, but joined Manchester United on his 14th birthday in 1987. He made his professional debut for the club in 1991 and spent the next 23 years in the first team. He retired from playing with the end of the 2013–14 season, holding the club record for competitive appearances – 963. Towards the end of the 2013–14 season, he became the club&#x27;s interim player-manager following the sacking of David Moyes. He was assistant manager under Moyes&#x27; permanent replacement, Louis van Gaal. Giggs left United in July 2016, following the appointment of José Mourinho. During his time at United he won 13 Premier League titles – more than any other player in history, four FA Cups, three League Cups, two UEFA Champions League titles, a FIFA Club World Cup, an Intercontinental Cup, a UEFA Super Cup and nine FA Community Shields. Manchester United and Liverpool are the only clubs in English football history to have won more league championships than Giggs.

At international level, Giggs played for the Wales national team 64 times between 1991 and 2007, and captained the Great Britain team that competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He became the new manager of the Wales national team in January 2018. Giggs led Wales to qualification for UEFA Euro 2020. He did not manage the team at the tournament however, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as he was arrested on suspicion of assault. His assistant manager Rob Page took charge in his absence. Giggs resigned in June 2022, and Page was named as his successor.

Giggs was the first player in history to win two consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year awards (1992 and 1993), though he did not win the PFA Player of the Year award until 2009. He was the only player to play in each of the first 22 seasons of the Premier League, as well as the only player to score in each of the first 21 seasons. He was elected into the PFA Team of the Century in 2007, the Premier League Team of the Decade in 2003, and the FA Cup Team of the Century. He holds the record for the most assists in Premier League history, with 162, and the most assists in UEFA Champions League history with 41. He was named as BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2009, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2007 Birthday Honours for his services to football.

== Early years ==
Giggs was born at St David&#x27;s Hospital in Canton, Cardiff, to Danny Wilson, a rugby union player for Cardiff RFC, and Lynne Giggs (now Lynne Johnson). Giggs is mixed race – his paternal grandfather is a Sierra Leone Creole – and has spoken of the racism he faced as a child. As a child, Giggs grew up in Ely, a suburb of western Cardiff. His younger brother, Rhodri, is a former manager of EFL League Two club Salford City.

He spent much time with his mother&#x27;s parents and playing football and rugby league on the roads outside their house in Pentrebane. In 1980, when Giggs was six years old, his father switched from rugby union to rugby league, and signed for Swinton RLFC, forcing the whole family to move north to Swinton, a town in Salford, Greater Manchester. The move was a traumatic one, as Giggs was very close to his grandparents in Cardiff, but he would often return there with his family at weekends or on school holidays.

After moving to Salford, Giggs appeared for the local team, Deans FC, who were coached by Manchester City scout Dennis Schofield. Schofield recommended Giggs to Manchester City, and he was signed up to their School of Excellence. Meanwhile, Giggs continued to play for Salford Boys, who went on to reach the final of the Granada Schools Cup competition at Anfield in 1987. Giggs captained the Salford team to victory over their Blackburn counterparts, was man of the match, and the trophy was presented to him by Liverpool chief scout Ron Yeats. Giggs also played rugby league at schoolboy level.

While playing for Deans, Giggs was observed regularly by local newsagent and Old Trafford steward Harold Wood. Wood spoke personally to Alex Ferguson who sent a scout, and Giggs was eventually offered a trial over the 1986 Christmas period. Giggs played in a match for Salford Boys against a United Under-15s side at The Cliff and scored a hat-trick, with Ferguson watching from his office window. On 29 November 1987 (his 14th birthday), Ferguson turned up at Giggs&#x27; house with United scout Joe Brown and offered him two years on associate schoolboy forms. They offered to waive YTS forms and persuaded Giggs to sign by offering the opportunity to turn professional in three years. Using the name Ryan Wilson, Giggs captained England at schoolboy level, playing at Wembley Stadium against Germany in 1989. He changed his surname to that of his mother at the age of 16, when his mother remarried, two years after his parents&#x27; separation.

=== 1990–1995: Debut and early career ===
Giggs was offered his first professional contract on 29 November 1990 (his 17th birthday). He accepted the contract and became a professional two days later (1 December 1990).

At this time, United had recently won the FA Cup – their first major trophy since the appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager in November 1986. After two seasons in the league where they had finished mid-table, they were finally starting to threaten the dominance of Liverpool and Arsenal, though they only managed to finish sixth that season. Ferguson&#x27;s quest for a successful left-winger had not been an easy one since the departure of Jesper Olsen two years earlier; he had initially signed Ralph Milne, but the player was not a success at United and lasted just one season in the first team before Ferguson secured the Southampton winger Danny Wallace in September 1989. Wallace had failed to shine at Old Trafford, and by the time Giggs turned professional Wallace was contending with 19-year-old Lee Sharpe for the role of first-choice left winger.

Giggs made his League debut against Everton at Old Trafford on 2 March 1991, as a substitute for the injured full-back Denis Irwin in a 2–0 defeat. In his first full start, Giggs was credited with his first-ever goal in a 1–0 win in the Manchester derby on 4 May 1991, though it appeared to be a Colin Hendry own goal. However, he was not included in the squad of 16 that defeated Barcelona in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final 11 days later. Lee Sharpe, who had won the race to displace Danny Wallace, took to the field as United&#x27;s left winger, while Wallace was selected as a substitute. Giggs became a first-team regular early in the 1991–92 season, yet remained active with the youth system and captained the team, made up of many of &quot;Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings,&quot; to an FA Youth Cup triumph in 1992. 

Giggs paved the way as the first of many Manchester United youth players to rise into the first team under Ferguson but as the youngest member of the United first-team squad, Giggs looked to the older players such as Bryan Robson for advice. Robson recommended that Giggs sign up with Harry Swales, the agent that he himself had inherited from Kevin Keegan.

That season, Giggs played in the team that finished as runners-up to Leeds United in the final year of the old First Division before the advent of the Premier League. United had led the table for much of the season before a run of dismal results in April saw them overtaken by the West Yorkshire side. Giggs collected his first piece of silverware on 12 April 1992 as United defeated Nottingham Forest in the League Cup Final after Giggs had set up Brian McClair to score the only goal of the game. In the semi-final he had scored the winning goal against Middlesbrough. At the end of the season, he was voted PFA Young Player of the Year – the award which had been credited to his colleague Lee Sharpe a year earlier.

By the start of the 1992–93 season, the first season of the newly formed Premier League, Giggs had ousted Sharpe to become United&#x27;s first-choice left-winger. He was recognised as one of English football&#x27;s two best emerging young wingers, alongside Steve McManaman, who were notable for being a throwback to the Stanley Matthews era of the 1950s winger. Giggs helped United to their first top-division title win for 26 years.

His emergence and the arrival of Eric Cantona heralded the dominance of United in the Premier League. Ferguson was protective of him, refusing to allow Giggs to be interviewed until he turned 20, eventually granting the first interview to the BBC&#x27;s Des Lynam for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in the 1993–94 season. United won the double that season, and Giggs was one of their key players alongside the likes of Cantona, Paul Ince and Mark Hughes. Giggs also played for United in the Football League Cup final, where they lost 3–1 to Aston Villa.

Off the pitch, newspapers claimed Giggs had &quot;single-handedly revolutionised football&#x27;s image&quot; when he appeared as a teenager &quot;with pace to burn, a bramble patch of black hair bouncing around his puppy popstar face, and a dazzling, gluey relationship between his impossibly fleet left foot and a football.&quot; As a result of this, he was afforded many opportunities not normally offered to footballers at his young age, such as hosting his television show, &quot;Ryan Giggs&#x27; Soccer Skills&quot;, which aired in 1994, and also had a book based on the series. Giggs was part of the Premier League&#x27;s attempt to market itself globally, and he featured on countless football and lad mag covers, becoming a household name and fuelling the era where footballers started to become celebrity idols on a par with pop stars, in and around the mid to late 1990s. Despite his aversion to attention, Giggs also became a teenage pin-up and was once described as the &quot;Premiership&#x27;s First Poster Boy,&quot; and the &quot;boy wonder.&quot; He was hailed as the first football star to capture the public imagination in a way unseen since the days of George Best; the irony was that Best and Bobby Charlton used to describe Giggs as their favourite young player, turning up at The Cliff training ground just to watch him. Best once quipped, &quot;One day they might even say that I was another Ryan Giggs.&quot;

At the end of the 1993–94 season, Giggs won a second title in a row, and became the first player in history to win two consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year awards, a feat equalled by Robbie Fowler, Wayne Rooney and Dele Alli.

Giggs proved to be a scorer of great goals, with many of them being shortlisted for various Goal of the Season awards. Widely regarded as among his best were those against Queens Park Rangers in 1994, Tottenham in 1994, Everton in 1995, Coventry in 1996, and his solo effort against Arsenal in the replay of the 1999 FA Cup semi-final. During extra time, Giggs picked up possession after Patrick Vieira gave the ball away, then ran from his own half, dribbled past the whole Arsenal back line, including Tony Adams, Lee Dixon and Martin Keown before launching his left-footed strike just under David Seaman&#x27;s bar and beyond his reach. He famously whipped off his shirt during his goal celebration as he ran over to his teammates. It also has the distinction of being the last ever goal scored in an FA Cup semi-final replay as, from the following season, the FA Cup semi-finals are decided in a single game, with extra time and a penalty shootout if required.

=== 1995–2000 ===
1994–95 saw Giggs restricted through injury to 29 Premier League games and only 1 goal. Later in the season, he recovered his form and fitness, though it was too late to help United to any major trophies. A failure to beat West Ham United on the final day of the season saw them lose the Premier League title to Blackburn Rovers. A week later, Giggs came on as a substitute in the FA Cup final against Everton, but United lost 1–0.

On a more positive side in the 1994–95 season, Giggs did get on the scoresheet twice in the opening Champions League game against IFK Göteborg (a 4–2 win, although United ultimately failed to progress to the quarter-finals) and also managed a goal in the FA Cup fourth-round victory over Wrexham, meaning that he had managed four goals in all competitions that season.

In 1995–96, Giggs returned to full form and played a vital part in United&#x27;s unique second double, with his goal against Everton at Goodison Park on 9 September 1995 being shortlisted for the &quot;goal of the season&quot; award, though it was eventually beaten by a goal by Manchester City&#x27;s Georgi Kinkladze. In November that season, Giggs scored two goals in a Premier League match against Southampton, where United won 4–1 to keep up the pressure on a Newcastle United side who actually went ten points clear on 23 December but were finally overhauled by United in mid-March. Giggs was also in the side for United&#x27;s FA Cup final win over Liverpool on 11 May 1996, though Eric Cantona scored the only goal of the game. By now, Giggs had several new key colleagues in youngsters Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Paul Scholes. Beckham took over from Andrei Kanchelskis on the right-wing and Butt succeeded Paul Ince in central midfield to complete a new look United midfield along with Giggs and Roy Keane.

The following season, Giggs had his first real chance to shine in Europe. Having played a key role in United winning their third league title in four seasons, he helped them reach the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, the first United side in 28 years to achieve this. However, their hopes of European glory were ended by Borussia Dortmund, who edged them out by winning each leg of the semi-final 1–0. At the end of this season, Juventus&#x27; Alessandro Del Piero told Italian media that Giggs was one of his two favourite players.

In 1997–98, United were pipped to the Premier League title by Arsenal, following a dismal run of form in March and early April, leaving them without a trophy for only the second time since 1989. The following season, Giggs missed a lot of games through injury, but when he was fit his form was excellent and he played in both of United&#x27;s cup finals that season. Memorable moments were his extra-time goal in the FA Cup semi-final against arch-rivals Arsenal giving United a 2–1 win, and his 90th-minute equaliser in the home leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final against Juventus.

The highpoint in the 1998–99 season was when Giggs set up the equalising goal scored by Teddy Sheringham in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final that set United on their way to the Treble.

Giggs was also the Man of the Match as United beat Palmeiras 1–0 to claim the Intercontinental Cup later that year.

=== 2000–2005 ===
Giggs became United&#x27;s longest-serving player when Denis Irwin left in May 2002, and he became a pivotal part of the club, despite still being in his 20s. Giggs continued to excel in the four years that followed the Treble triumph of 1999. United were Premier League champions in three of the four seasons following the treble, as well as reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals three times and the semi-finals once. In April 2001, he signed a new five-year contract.

Giggs celebrated his 10-year anniversary at Old Trafford with a testimonial match against Celtic at the start of the 2001–02 campaign, losing 4–3 in a game featuring a cameo by Eric Cantona. However, this was one of the most disappointing seasons United had endured since Giggs made his debut, as a dismal run of form in early winter ultimately cost them the league title and they were surprisingly knocked out of the Champions League on away goals in the semi-finals by German underdogs Bayer Leverkusen. A year later, on 23 August 2002, he bagged his 100th career goal in a draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

The 2002–03 season was one to forget for Giggs. He was forced to defend his poor form, insisting that he was not finished. This dip in form included being booed off the pitch in the 74th minute of a 1–1 semi-final first leg draw at home to Blackburn Rovers in the League Cup on 7 January and an open-goal miss during a 2–0 defeat against Arsenal in the FA Cup on 16 February that was described as the worst of his career, and prompted chants by the Arsenal fans of &quot;Give it to Giggsy.&quot; A week later, on 24 February, Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon refused to rule out the possibility of Giggs leaving Old Trafford, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s too soon to say whether we would even consider a bid, and all we want to do at the moment is concentrate on this season.&quot; It was further claimed that a rift in the dressing room was contributing towards Giggs&#x27; possible departure. However, the following day, Giggs played one of his most memorable games, in a 3–0 victory against Juventus. After coming on as a substitute for Diego Forlán in the eighth minute, Giggs scored twice, including a goal that would later be heralded as one of his greatest goals and one of his finest Champions League moments.

After speculation throughout the season that Giggs was close to joining Italian club Inter Milan, possibly with Brazilian striker Adriano as a makeweight, Giggs quashed the rumours by saying he was happy at United.

He played in his fourth FA Cup triumph on 22 May 2004, making him one of only two players (the other being Roy Keane) to have won the trophy four times while playing for Manchester United. He has also finished with a runners-up medal three times (1995, 2005 and 2007). His participation in the victory over Liverpool in September 2004 made him the third player to play 600 games for United, alongside Sir Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game.

In 2005, Giggs&#x27; form had improved and was no longer suffering with the hamstring injuries which had plagued his career, which he attributed to taking up yoga.

=== 2005–2010 ===
Giggs signed a two-year contract extension with United when chief executive David Gill relented on his normal policy of not signing players over 30 to contracts longer than one year. Giggs benefited from being largely injury-free aside from a series of hamstring problems.

Giggs scored his first goal of the 2006–07 season in a 2–1 victory over Watford on 26 August 2006, with his goal proving to be the winner. Giggs scored the winner in United&#x27;s next game, a 1–0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 9 September, scoring a header in the eighth minute. Giggs provided a goal and an assist in the final Champions League group game against Benfica on 6 December, with his free-kick being converted by Nemanja Vidić before Giggs headed in a Cristiano Ronaldo cross.

In February 2007, Giggs scored the final three goals of his season. He scored the final goal in a 4–0 away win against Tottenham on 4 February which put United six points clear of Chelsea. On 20 February, Giggs scored the winning goal against Lille in the UEFA Champions League with a quickly taken free-kick that caused the Lille players to walk off the pitch in protest. Giggs later said he was amazed by the situation, as no rule had been broken. On 24 February, Giggs scored the equalising goal against Fulham in a game which United went on to win via a late Cristiano Ronaldo winner to go nine points clear of Chelsea.

On 6 May 2007, with Chelsea only able to manage a 1–1 draw with London rivals Arsenal, Manchester United became the champions of England. In doing so, Giggs set a new record of nine league titles, beating the previous record of eight he shared with Alan Hansen and Phil Neal (who won all of their titles with Liverpool). In the 2007 FA Cup Final, Giggs had a goal ruled out in the 14th minute of extra time after referee Steve Bennett deemed him to have fouled goalkeeper Petr Čech in forcing the ball across the line.

Giggs played a starring role in United&#x27;s 2007 FA Community Shield victory after netting in the first half to bring the game to a 1–1 draw, which led to penalty triumph for the Red Devils after &#x27;keeper Edwin van der Sar saved all of Chelsea&#x27;s first three penalties; the goal was Giggs&#x27; first professional goal at Wembley Stadium.
In the 2007–08 season, Alex Ferguson adopted a rotation system between Giggs and newcomers Nani and Anderson. Giggs scored his 100th league goal for United against Derby County on 8 December 2007, which United won 4–1. More landmarks have been achieved: on 20 February 2008 he made his 100th appearance in the UEFA Champions League in a game against Lyon and on 11 May 2008, he came on as a substitute for Park Ji-sung to equal Sir Bobby Charlton&#x27;s record of 758 appearances for United. Giggs scored the second goal in that match, sealing his, and United&#x27;s, 10th Premier League title. Ten days later, on 21 May 2008, Giggs broke Bobby Charlton&#x27;s appearance record for United when coming on as an 87th-minute substitute for Paul Scholes in the UEFA Champions League Final against Chelsea. United won the final, defeating Chelsea 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra time, with Giggs converting the winning penalty in sudden death.

At the start of Manchester United&#x27;s 2008–09 campaign, Sir Alex Ferguson began placing Giggs at central midfield, behind the forwards, instead of his favoured wing position. Sir Alex Ferguson said in an interview, &quot;(Giggs) is a very valuable player, he will be 35 this November but at 35, he can be United&#x27;s key player. At 25, Ryan would shatter defenders with his run down the flank, but at 35, he will play deeper.&quot; Giggs has begun taking his coaching badges and Ferguson has hinted that he would like Giggs to serve as his coaching staff after retirement like Ole Gunnar Solskjær did.

Following speculation earlier in the year, in February 2009, Giggs signed a one-year extension to his current contract – which was due to expire in June 2009. After a successful season, Giggs was short-listed along with four other Manchester United teammates for the PFA Player of the Year. On 26 April 2009, Giggs received the award, despite having started just 12 games throughout the 2008–09 season (at the time of receiving the trophy). This was the first time in his career that Giggs had received the award. Prior to the awards ceremony, Alex Ferguson had given his backing for Giggs to win the award and stated that it would be fitting, given Giggs&#x27; long term contribution to the game. Giggs made his 800th appearance for Manchester United on 29 April 2009, in the 1–0 semi-final win over Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League. On 16 May 2009, Manchester United won the Premier League after a 0–0 draw against Arsenal, both United&#x27;s and Giggs&#x27; 11th Premier League titles.

Giggs scored his first Manchester United hat-trick in a pre-season friendly against Hangzhou Greentown after coming on as a second-half substitute.

On 12 September 2009, Giggs made his 700th start for United. Giggs scored his 150th goal for United, only the ninth player to do so for the club, against Wolfsburg in his first UEFA Champions League game of the season. On 28 November 2009, the eve of his 36th birthday, Giggs scored his 100th Premier League goal – all for Manchester United – scoring the final goal in a 4–1 victory over Portsmouth at Fratton Park, and becoming only the 17th player to reach the milestone in the Premier League.

On 30 November 2009, the day after his 36th birthday, it was reported that Giggs would be offered an additional one-year contract which would run until the end of the 2010–11 season and see him past the 20th anniversary of his first game and first goal for United. On the same day, Giggs was nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2009, which he subsequently won. On 12 December 2009, Giggs&#x27; surpassed countryman Gary Speed&#x27;s outfield record of 535 Premier League games. On 18 December 2009, Giggs signed a one-year contract extension with United, keeping him at the club until June 2011, taking him past the 20th anniversary of his first professional contract and that of his first-team debut – a rare occurrence of a player reaching the 20-year mark with the same club and with unbroken service. On 31 December 2009, Giggs was named the Manchester United Player of the Decade.

=== 2010–2014 ===
On 24 April 2010, Giggs scored the first ever league penalties of his career, netting two penalties in a 3–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur.

On 16 August 2010, Giggs kept up his record of scoring in every Premier League season since its inception as he netted United&#x27;s third in their 3–0 home victory over Newcastle United in their opening fixture of the new campaign. As he found the net in the final two seasons of the old Football League First Division, he had now scored in 21 successive top division campaigns. On 17 January 2011, Giggs reached 600 league appearances (all for Manchester United), as he played in their goalless draw against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Giggs signed a one-year contract extension with Manchester United on 18 February, keeping him at the club until June 2012. On 6 March 2011, Giggs surpassed the Manchester United league appearance record of Bobby Charlton by playing his 607th game against Liverpool. On 26 April, against Schalke 04 in the Champions League semi-final first leg, Giggs scored the first goal from a Wayne Rooney pass, also making himself the oldest goalscorer in Champions League history to date. Giggs also played in the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final, where Manchester United were defeated 3–1 by Barcelona.

Giggs made his first start of the 2011–12 season in the UEFA Champions League away at Benfica. He scored United&#x27;s equalising goal in a 1–1 draw at the Estádio da Luz, in the process breaking his own record for the oldest goalscorer in Champions League history. He also became the first man ever to score in 16 different Champions League campaigns, moving clear of Raúl who was tied with Giggs on 15 seasons. Raúl though holds the record for scoring in 14 consecutive Champions League seasons. On 19 November, Giggs played in a league game in his home country of Wales for the first time in his distinguished career against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium in a United 1–0 win. Giggs maintained his record of scoring in each of the past 22 top-flight seasons by scoring United&#x27;s third goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage in a 5–0 win on 21 December, his first of the season in the league. On 10 February 2012, Giggs signed a one-year contract extension with Manchester United.
On 26 February 2012, Giggs made his 900th appearance for Manchester United, in a 2–1 away win against Norwich City. He marked the occasion by scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute, scoring from a cross by Ashley Young. After the match, Alex Ferguson told &quot;BBC Sport&quot; he believed that a player playing in 900 games for one club &quot;won&#x27;t be done again&quot;. By March 2011, Giggs had played with more than 140 different players for the Manchester United first team.

On 19 October 2012, Giggs (just over a month short of his 39th birthday) told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that he would like to move into management when he retires as a player. He also said that he was still undecided on whether he would still be playing after the current football season ends.

Giggs scored his first Premier League goal of the 2012–13 season against Everton on 10 February 2013 in a 2–0 home win, extending his goalscoring sequence to 23 consecutive seasons in the highest division including all 21 Premier League seasons.

He signed a new one-year contract with Manchester United on 1 March 2013, keeping him at Old Trafford until June 2014. On 5 March, Giggs made his 1,000th competitive appearance in a 2–1 home loss to Real Madrid in the second leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League. On 4 July, Giggs was appointed as player-coach by new manager David Moyes with immediate effect. Giggs became interim player-manager when Moyes was sacked in April 2014.

On 2 October, after coming off the substitute bench against Shakhtar Donetsk, Giggs became all-time leading appearance holder in the European competition, overtaking Raúl, an achievement he described as &quot;special&quot;. In November, Giggs celebrated his 40th birthday, leading to media outlets and football figures praising him for reaching the milestone while still an active professional footballer.

Giggs announced his retirement from professional football on 19 May 2014 in an open letter to all Manchester United fans posted on the club website. Upon retirement, Giggs received many plaudits for the achievements he earned throughout his career, and the longevity of it.

== International career ==
=== England Schoolboys ===
Born in Cardiff to Welsh parents, Giggs represented Wales at international level. As a youngster, Giggs captained England Schoolboys, but contrary to popular belief, he was never eligible for the senior England team (eligibility at the schoolboy level depends solely upon the location of the school, in Giggs&#x27; case Moorside High School in Salford). In October 2009, new rules were introduced for the Home Nations&#x27; associations that would have enabled Giggs to represent England had he not already represented Wales in an official competition, but Giggs has always maintained that he would have chosen to play for Wales anyway; he stated in 2002, &quot;I&#x27;d rather go through my career without qualifying for a major championship than play for a country where I wasn&#x27;t born or which my parents didn&#x27;t have anything to do with&quot;.

In his one year with the England Schoolboys team, Giggs played nine times, all as captain, winning seven matches and losing twice. Among the wins was a 4–0 victory over his Welsh peers, many of whom he would play alongside when he made the step up to the Welsh youth team the following year.

=== Wales ===

In May 1991, Giggs made his debut for the Wales Under-21s, a 2–1 victory over Poland in Warsaw. It would turn out to be his only appearance for the team, as he received a call-up to the senior team later that year.

Giggs made his international debut away to Germany in October 1991, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute for Eric Young at the age of to become the youngest player to appear for the Welsh senior team; he held this record until June 1998, when Ryan Green appeared against Malta at the age of . Wales were still in contention to qualify for UEFA Euro 1992 before the game, but a 4–1 victory for the Germans, who went on to win their remaining games against Belgium and Luxembourg, meant they qualified at Wales&#x27; expense.

Giggs&#x27; first senior goal for Wales came on 31 March 1993 in a 3–0 win over Belgium in Cardiff in a World Cup qualifying game, the same game in which Ian Rush scored for Wales for a record 24th time.

After his international debut in 1991 against Germany, Giggs missed 18 consecutive friendly games before finally making his first friendly appearance for Wales against Finland in March 2000, by which time he had already accrued 25 caps. The reason for his continued absence from non-competitive fixtures was largely a protective measure against unnecessary injuries; in his autobiography, Giggs states: &quot;At that time, whenever I played two games in one week I always seemed to pick up an injury, so [Alex Ferguson] and I sat down and looked at it game by game. If the international was a friendly, the feeling was that I didn&#x27;t have to play.&quot; Regardless, his regularly withdrawing from Wales squads and routinely missing friendlies was criticised.

In a qualifier against England for the 2006 FIFA World Cup at Old Trafford where Wales lost 2–0, Giggs played against some present and former Manchester United teammates including David Beckham, Gary Neville, and Wayne Rooney. During a 2006 World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan on 12 October 2005, Giggs scored a rare double in a 2–0 win, but Wales failed to reach the play-offs.

In September 2006, he played in a friendly against Brazil at White Hart Lane where Wales lost 2–0. Brazil coach Dunga complimented Giggs&#x27; performance by stating he would not look out of place playing for the five-time world champions alongside stars such as Kaká and Ronaldinho.

Giggs announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday, 30 May 2007, at a press conference held at The Vale of Glamorgan Hotel, drawing the curtain on a 16-year international career. He cited concentrating on his United career as the main reason for stepping down. His final game for Wales, and as captain, was the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Czech Republic on 2 June at Cardiff. He earned his 64th cap in this game and won the Man of the Match award as Wales drew 0–0. In November, he was one of three players in the final nomination by the FAW for the Wales Player of the Year award, which was ultimately won by Craig Bellamy.

In an interview with the &quot;Western Mail&quot; on 26 March 2010, Giggs hinted that he might be tempted to come out of international retirement for his country&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, in order to cover for the injured Aaron Ramsey. He later clarified his position to BBC Radio Manchester, saying that he would only return to Wales duty in an emergency.

=== Great Britain ===
On 28 June 2012, Giggs was confirmed as one of the three over-age players selected for Great Britain to compete at 2012 Summer Olympics alongside Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards, and he was subsequently named the team captain.

He scored with a header against the United Arab Emirates in a 3–1 win on 29 July to become the oldest goalscorer in the football competition at the Summer Olympics at the age of 38 years and 243 days, beating an 88-year-old record that had been held by Egypt&#x27;s Hussein Hegazi. In addition, by featuring in the same match, he became the oldest outfield Olympic footballer.

== Managerial career ==

=== Manchester United ===
Giggs was appointed as a player-coach at Manchester United on 4 July 2013, as part of the coaching staff under new manager David Moyes. When Moyes was sacked on 22 April 2014, after less than 10 months in the job, Giggs took over as the club&#x27;s interim player-manager, compiling a record of two wins, a draw and a defeat in the final four games of the 2013–14 season. After his final match in charge, a 1–1 draw with Southampton, Giggs admitted to breaking down in tears, in part due to the pressure of managing United, and also said he had struggled to sleep during the period. When Louis van Gaal was announced as Moyes&#x27; permanent replacement on 19 May 2014, Giggs was also appointed as Van Gaal&#x27;s assistant manager.

Giggs was praised for giving debuts to youngsters James Wilson and Tom Lawrence in a 3–1 victory over Hull City, a game in which he brought himself on as a substitute for Lawrence.

Giggs was suggested by many – including Louis van Gaal – as the Dutchman&#x27;s potential successor at Manchester United. However, following the appointment of Portuguese coach José Mourinho, Giggs announced his departure from the club on 2 July 2016.

=== Wales ===

Giggs was appointed manager of the Wales national team on 15 January 2018 on a four-year contract, succeeding Chris Coleman, who had left the role to take up the manager&#x27;s position at Sunderland the previous November. His first match in charge was in a 6–0 win over China during the 2018 China Cup, where Gareth Bale broke the all-time scoring record previously held by Ian Rush. Later that year, Wales participated in the UEFA Nations League, finishing behind Denmark with six points. In 2019, Wales had a slow start to their qualifying group, only accruing three points from three matches. However, they went unbeaten for the rest of the year, culminating in a 2–0 win over Hungary and securing qualification for UEFA Euro 2020. The resulting tournament was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next time that Giggs would manage the national team was behind closed doors during the UEFA Nations League campaign. His final match in charge was a 1–0 win over Bulgaria.

On 3 November 2020, and following Giggs&#x27; arrest on assault charges, his assistant manager Rob Page became the caretaker manager. On 20 June 2022, it was announced that Giggs would step down from his position due to his upcoming trial.

== Player profile ==
=== Style of play ===
A skilful and dynamic left-footed midfielder, Giggs usually played as a traditional out-and-out left-sided midfielder, who would take on opposing defenders, although he was a versatile player, who was capable of playing on either flank, as well as in several other positions; throughout his career he was also fielded in various offensive roles, as a left or right-sided winger or outside forward in an attacking trident, as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying forward, or even as a striker. In the later stages of his career, as his pace and athleticism declined, he was often used as a defensive or central midfielder, or as a deep-lying playmaker; he was even deployed as a full-back on occasion. A quick and technically gifted player, in his prime, his main traits were his speed, acceleration, strength, ball control, flair, dribbling skills, and trickery in possession, as well as his vision; he also was able to refine his crossing and passing ability as his career progressed, which made him an excellent assist provider, and saw him take on more of a playmaking role for his team in later years, which enabled him to dictate play in midfield and create chances for teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself. A fast and energetic player, he also drew praise in the media for his tactical intelligence, movement, stamina, work-rate, and consistency; furthermore, he was an accurate free kick taker. In addition to his footballing skills, Giggs also stood out for his leadership and longevity throughout his career.

=== Discipline ===
Giggs was never sent off in his 24-season playing career for Manchester United and was only once sent off when playing for Wales, on 5 September 2001 in a World Cup qualifier against Norway; Giggs received a second yellow card in the 86th minute. In November 2003, he was found guilty of improper conduct by the FA due to his behaviour during the Battle of Old Trafford game against Arsenal (one of two United and six Arsenal players charged over the incident); Giggs received a £7,500 fine but avoided suspension. In the same week, Giggs received a two-match suspension from international football for deliberately elbowing Russian player Vadim Yevseyev in the face during the first leg of the Euro 2004 play-offs. The offence was missed by referee Lucílio Batista, but Giggs was later charged using video evidence.

== Endorsements and public image ==
Giggs featured in advertisements for Reebok, ITV Digital, Kagome tomato juice, Quorn and Celcom. A 1996 Reebok advertisement, which did not feature him, included figures such as Sting, Tom Jones, Richard Attenborough and George Best impersonating him.

According to an article by &quot;BBC Sport&quot;: &quot;In the early 1990s, Giggs was David Beckham before Beckham was even holding down a place in the United first team. If you put his face on the cover of a football magazine, it guaranteed you the biggest sales of the year. Why? Men would buy it to read about &#x27;the new Best&#x27; and girls bought it because they wanted his face all over their bedroom walls. Giggs had the million-pound boot deal (Reebok), the lucrative sponsorship deals in the Far East (Fuji) and the celebrity girlfriends (Dani Behr, Davinia Taylor) at a time when Beckham was being sent on loan to Preston North End.&quot;

Giggs features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, and was selected to appear on the cover of &quot;FIFA Football 2003&quot; alongside Dutch international midfielder Edgar Davids, and Brazilian international fullback Roberto Carlos. Giggs was included in the &quot;FIFA 16&quot; and &quot;17&quot; Ultimate Team Legends.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Giggs is the son of former rugby union and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson. Giggs was christened Ryan Joseph Wilson but as a teenager changed his surname to that of his mother after his parents separated. Giggs is said to have inherited his balance and athleticism from his father. He is a distant cousin of the Barbados international footballer Curtis Hutson.

Giggs married his long-time partner, Stacey Cooke, in a private ceremony on 7 September 2007. They have two children, both born in Salford, and lived in Worsley, Greater Manchester, close to where the player grew up. Giggs and Cooke divorced in 2017. His son Zach Giggs is also a footballer.

Giggs conducted an eight-year affair with his brother Rhodri&#x27;s wife, Natasha. The affair resulted in members of Giggs&#x27; family repudiating their former ties to Ryan; after Ryan was appointed as manager of the Wales national team, his father Danny said he was &quot;ashamed&quot; of him and that &quot;I can&#x27;t even bring myself to use his name&quot;.

=== Activism ===
In August 2006, Giggs became an ambassador for UNICEF UK, in recognition for his work with Manchester United&#x27;s &#x27;United for UNICEF&#x27; partnership with the children&#x27;s organisation. Giggs visited UNICEF projects in Thailand and told the BBC: &quot;As a footballer I can&#x27;t imagine life without the use of one of my legs... Sadly this is exactly what happens to thousands of children every year when they accidentally step on a landmine.&quot;

=== Post-playing career ===
In October 2010, Giggs said he would &quot;probably finish [his] career here [Old Trafford],&quot; and that he could not see himself &quot;dropping down leagues and playing at a lesser level.&quot; He said he wanted to go into coaching, describing the management of Manchester United or Wales as &quot;the two ultimate jobs,&quot; and stating that he was halfway through his UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; coaching licence.

Gary Neville, ahead of his 2011 testimonial, said he would put the proceeds towards a supporters club and hotel near Old Trafford. Trafford Council approved the hotel in 2012 despite objections from Manchester United. In 2013, Giggs and Neville launched a hospitality company named &quot;GG Hospitality&quot;, with plans to build football-themed hotels and cafés around the United Kingdom, initially in Manchester and London. The first operation was a football-themed restaurant named Café Football in Stratford, London, which opened in November 2013, with Hotel Football, previously under the guise of the supporters club Neville announced in 2011, scheduled to be opened in late 2014.

In 2014, it was announced that Giggs, along with former Manchester United players Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville, had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014–15 season. with plans to get the club to the Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of &#x27;92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim.

In September 2017, along with former United teammates including Gary Neville, Giggs proposed a university in Greater Manchester, named University Academy 92 which would offer &quot;broader courses than traditional degrees&quot; and attract students who &quot;otherwise might not go on to higher education&quot;.

In November 2017, it was reported that Giggs had signed a consultancy deal with the Promotion Fund of Vietnamese Football Talents FC (PVF). The two-year deal would involve making two trips per year to Vietnam.

=== Gagging order ===

In May 2011, it was reported in non-UK media sources that Giggs was the identity of &quot;CTB&quot; in &quot;CTB v News Group Newspapers&quot;, a footballer who had obtained an anonymised gagging order in relation to an alleged extra-marital affair with model Imogen Thomas. Giggs took legal action against the social networking site Twitter after he was named by a user in a list of identities of individuals who had allegedly taken out so-called &quot;super-injunctions&quot;. A blogger for &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine remarked that Giggs had &quot;not heard of the Streisand effect,&quot; observing that mentions of his name had increased significantly after the case against Twitter had been reported.

On 22 May 2011, the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, a Scottish newspaper, published a thinly-disguised photograph of Giggs on its front page, with the word &quot;CENSORED&quot; covering his eyes. &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; editor Richard Walker stated that the London High Court ruling had no force in Scotland, unless copies of the paper were sold in England or Wales. On 23 May, the gagging order set off a political controversy, with Prime Minister David Cameron commenting that the law should be reviewed to &quot;catch up with how people consume media today&quot;. On the same day, Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming used parliamentary privilege to name Giggs as &quot;CTB&quot;.

=== Arrest and trial ===
On 3 November 2020, Giggs was arrested on suspicion of two counts of assault against his ex-girlfriend, Kate Greville, and her younger sister, Emma. He denied the charges against him.

In April 2021, he was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm to Kate Greville and common assault against Emma Greville, as well as coercive and controlling behaviour against Kate. On 28 April, he appeared in court, where he denied the charges.

His trial began on 8 August 2022. The jury of seven women and four men was discharged on 31 August, having been unable to reach a verdict on any of the charges. On 18 July 2023, two weeks before he was due to face a retrial, Giggs was cleared as the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew charges. The prosecutor said that Kate Greville was unwilling to give evidence in the retrial.

<text>USS &quot;Seadragon&quot; (SSN-584), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seadragon, a name for some types of seahorse. She was a nuclear-powered submarine.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Seadragon&quot; was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 29 September 1955 and her keel was laid down on 20 June 1956. She was launched on 16 August 1958, sponsored by Mrs. Robert L. Dennison, wife of Admiral Robert L. Dennison. Seadragon collided with a whale on October 6, 1959 during sea trials, causing only minor damage.SUBMARINE HITS WHALE; Collision of Nuclear Vessel Causes Some Damage (Published 1959) The ship was commissioned on 5 December 1959, with Lieutenant Commander George P. Steele in command.

==Operational history==
Following a Caribbean shakedown cruise, &quot;Seadragon&quot; returned to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, whence, on 1 August 1960, she sailed for the Pacific. Ordered to proceed via the Northwest Passage, she moved north to Parry Channel, at mid-month reached Lancaster Sound, the eastern end of the channel, and continued westward with Edward Parry&#x27;s 1819 journal as a guide.

Collecting oceanographic and hydrographic data en route, &quot;Seadragon&quot; transited the Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and McClure Strait. On 21 August, she completed the first submarine transit of the Northwest Passage, entered the Beaufort Sea, and headed for the North Pole, which she reached on 25 August. The ship surfaced through the thin ice becoming the third submarine to surface at the pole. Members of the crew laid out a softball diamond with the pitcher&#x27;s box at the pole where the captain claimed he hit a fly ball at 4:00 pm on Wednesday and it wasn&#x27;t caught until 4:00 am on Thursday. From the pole, &quot;Seadragon&quot; (having no other choice) turned south, and after conducting experiments in cooperation with scientists on ice island T-3, headed for the Chukchi Sea and Bering Strait. On 5 September, she reached Nome, Alaska, and, nine days later, she arrived at her home port, Pearl Harbor. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her transit of the Northwest Passage via Parry Channel.

For the next nine months, &quot;Seadragon&quot; was employed in local operations. In June 1961, she headed west for her first tour in the western Pacific (WestPac), during which she participated in Seventh Fleet exercises – primarily antisubmarine warfare training exercises – and completed a submerged endurance cruise of 58 days. In October, she returned to Pearl Harbor and local operations.

On 12 July 1962, &quot;Seadragon&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her second Arctic cruise. Transiting the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea, she contacted T-3, then moved further north to rendezvous with sister ship, , en route from New London, Connecticut. On 31 July, the two submarines rendezvoused under the ice and continued on to the North Pole, arriving on 2 August for sonar and weapons evaluations. The submarines were joined by the icebreaker . In late August, the submarines returned to their home ports. En route, &quot;Seadragon&quot;, which was scheduled to port at Seattle, Washington, rescued 12 survivors from a downed seaplane and delivered them to Port Angeles, Washington. On 14 September, &quot;Seadragon&quot; arrived back at Pearl Harbor.

During the first half of 1963, &quot;Seadragon&quot; participated in local operations and conducted her second WestPac cruise. On 8 July, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for her first refueling and overhaul. In late May 1964, she resumed operations in the Hawaiian area. Torpedo evaluations off the Washington coast followed; and, on 10 August 1964, &quot;Seadragon&quot; sailed west in response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. During September and October, she operated out of Subic Bay; then, after a call at Hong Kong continued on to Okinawa and Japan to conduct public relations cruises and to participate in further Seventh Fleet exercises.

On 27 October 1964, &quot;Seadragon&quot; became the first nuclear powered vessel to visit Hong Kong. This was followed shortly by an historic entry into Japanese waters and a port visit to Sasebo, Japan, on 12 November 1964. The visit was protested by China and the Soviet Union; the Soviets in particular warned that the visit would eventually lead to the introduction of nuclear weapons to Japan and alter the security status quo in East Asia. On 4 March 1965, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Again, in the fall of 1966 and early 1967, &quot;Seadragon&quot; became the first SSN to visit Yokosuka, Japan. She was the first nuclear powered vessel the Japanese government permitted to enter her home waters. This achievement has since often been compared with Commodore PERRY&#x27;s first expedition to Japan in 1853 as an achievement in international diplomacy. &quot;Seadragon&quot; was the first SSN to visit Hobart, Australia in January 1983. In twenty-four years of active service, &quot;Seadragon&quot; steamed over 200,000 miles, dove and surfaced 1800 times, made thirteen deployments to the Western Pacific, and conducted four under ice operations. &quot;Seadragon&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. The ship was overhauled three times, refueling at each overhaul. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was her home for all the overhauls and performed the inactivation commencing 1 October 1983. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, which she visited on occasional trips to the North Polar region, performed the recycling.
==Decommissioning==
Decommissioned on 12 June 1984 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986, ex-&quot;Seadragon&quot; entered the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program on 1 October 1994. On 18 September 1995, &quot;Seadragon&quot; ceased to exist. &quot;Seadragon&quot; was decommissioned after only 24 and a half years of commissioned service – five and a half years less than the normal 30 year service life for U.S. Navy submarines.

==In literature==

&quot;Seadragon&quot; is featured in the 2017 novel &quot;SSN Seadragon: The Crucible of Leviathan&quot; by J. P. Ronald, in which she takes part in an operation to thwart Soviet intervention in the Vietnam War.

<text>An eraser (also known as a rubber in some Commonwealth countries, including South Africa from which the material first used got its name) is an article of stationery that is used for removing marks from paper or skin (e.g. parchment or vellum). Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are made from vinyl, plastic, or gum-like materials.

At first, erasers were invented to erase mistakes made with a pencil; later, more abrasive ink erasers were introduced. The term is also used for things that remove marks from chalkboards and whiteboards.

== History ==

Before rubber erasers used today, tablets of wax were used to erase lead or charcoal marks from paper. Bits of rough stone such as sandstone or pumice were used to remove small errors from parchment or papyrus documents written in ink. Crustless bread was used; a Meiji period (1868–1912) Tokyo student said: &quot;Bread erasers were used in place of rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction on amount. So we thought nothing of taking these and eating a firm part to at least slightly satisfy our hunger.&quot;

In 1770 English engineer Edward Nairne is reported to have developed the first widely marketed rubber eraser, for an inventions competition. Until that time the material was known as &quot;gum elastic&quot; or by its Quechua name (via French) &quot;caoutchouc&quot;. Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber&#x27;s erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers. The invention was described by Joseph Priestley on April 15, 1770, in a footnote: &quot;I have seen a substance excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the mark of black-lead-pencil. ... It is sold by Mr. Nairne, Mathematical Instrument-Maker, opposite the Royal-Exchange.&quot; In 1770 the word &quot;rubber&quot; was in general use for any object used for rubbing; the word became attached to the new material sometime between 1770 and 1778.

However, raw rubber was perishable. In 1839 Charles Goodyear discovered the process of vulcanization, a method that would cure rubber, making it durable. Rubber erasers became common with the advent of vulcanization.

On March 30, 1858, Hymen Lipman of Philadelphia, United States, received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. It was later invalidated because it was determined to be simply a composite of two devices rather than an entirely new product.

Erasers may be free-standing blocks (&quot;block&quot; and &quot;wedge eraser&quot;), or conical caps that can slip onto the end of a pencil (&quot;cap eraser&quot;). A &quot;barrel&quot; or &quot;click eraser&quot; is a device shaped like a pencil, but instead of being filled with pencil lead, its barrel contains a retractable cylinder of eraser material (most commonly soft vinyl). Many, but not all, wooden pencils are made with attached erasers. Novelty erasers made in shapes intended to be amusing are often made of hard vinyl, which tends to smear heavy markings when used as an eraser.

==Types==

===Pencil or cap erasers===

Originally made from natural rubber, but now usually from cheaper SBR, this type contains mineral fillers and an abrasive such as pumice with a plasticizer such as vegetable oil. They are relatively hard (in order to remain attached to the pencil) and frequently colored pink.
They can also be permanently attached to the end of a pencil with a ferrule.

===Artist&#x27;s gum eraser===
The stylized word &quot;Art gum&quot; was first used in 1903 and trademarked in the United States in 1907. That type of eraser was originally made from oils such as corn oil vulcanized with sulfur dichloride although it may now be made from natural or synthetic rubber or vinyl compounds. It is very soft yet retains its shape and is not mechanically plastic, but crumbles as it is used. It is especially suited to cleaning large areas without damaging the paper. However, they are so soft as to be imprecise in use. The removed graphite is carried away in the crumbles, leaving the eraser clean, but resulting in a lot of eraser residue. This residue must then be brushed away with care, as the eraser particles are coated with the graphite and can make new marks. Art gum erasers are traditionally tan or brown, but some are blue.

===Vinyl erasers===
High-quality plasticized vinyl or other &quot;plastic&quot; erasers, originally trademarked &quot;Mylar&quot; in the mid-20th century, are softer, non-abrasive, and erase cleaner than standard rubber erasers. This is because the removed graphite does not remain on the eraser as much as rubber erasers, but is instead absorbed into the discarded vinyl scraps. Being softer and non-abrasive, they are less likely to damage canvas or paper. Engineers favor this type of eraser for work on technical drawings due to their gentleness on paper with less smearing to surrounding areas. They often come in white and can be found in a variety of shapes. More recently, very low-cost erasers are manufactured from highly plasticized vinyl compounds and made in decorative shapes.

===Elastomer erasers===
In these types, a thermoplastic elastomer combines a styrene resin elastomer and an olefin resin. These erasers have better erasability for erasing pencil marks compared to conventional vinyl erasers. Elastomers can be formed into thin cylindrical or other shapes to be used as extendable erasers.

===Kneaded erasers===
Kneaded erasers (called putty rubbers outside the United States) have a plastic consistency and are common to most artists&#x27; standard toolkit. They can be pulled into a point for erasing small areas and tight detail erasing, molded into a textured surface and used as a reverse stamp to give texture, or used in a &quot;blotting&quot; manner to lighten lines or shading without completely erasing them. They gradually lose their efficacy and resilience as they become infused with particles picked up from erasing and from their environment. They are not suited to erase large areas because of their tendency to deform under vigorous erasing.

===Poster putty===
Commonly sold in retail outlets with school supplies and home improvement products, this soft, malleable putty appears in many colors and under numerous brand names. Intended to adhere posters and prints to walls without damaging the underlying wall surface, poster putty works much the same as traditional kneaded erasers, but with a greater tack and in some circumstances, lifting strength. Poster putty does not erase so much as lighten by directly pulling particles of graphite, charcoal or pastel from a drawing. In this regard, poster putty does not smudge or damage work in the process. Repeatedly touching the putty to a drawing pulls ever more medium free, gradually lightening the work in a controlled fashion. Poster putty can be shaped into fine points or knife edges, making it ideal for detailed or small areas of work. It can be rolled across a surface to create visual textures. Poster putty loses its efficacy with use, becoming less tacky as the material grows polluted with debris and oils from the user&#x27;s skin.

===Electric erasers===
The electric eraser was invented in 1932 by Albert J. Dremel of Racine, Wisconsin, United States. It used a replaceable cylinder of eraser material held by a chuck driven on the axis of a motor. The speed of rotation allowed less pressure to be used, which minimized paper damage. Originally standard pencil-eraser rubber was used, later replaced by higher-performance vinyl. Dremel went on to develop an entire line of hand-held rotary power tools.

===Fiberglass erasers===
A fiberglass eraser, a bundle of very fine glass fibers, can be used for erasing and other tasks requiring abrasion. Typically the eraser is a pen-shaped device with a replaceable insert with glass fibers, which wear down in use. The fibers are very hard; in addition to removing pencil and pen markings, such erasers are used for cleaning traces on electronic circuit boards to facilitate soldering, removing rust, and many other applications. As an example of an unusual use, a fiberglass eraser was used for preparing a Pterosaur fossil embedded in a very hard and massive limestone. Because fiberglass erasers shed fiberglass dust when used, care must be taken during and after use to avoid accidental contamination with this abrasive dust in sensitive areas of the body, especially in the eyes.

===Other===
Felt chalkboard erasers or blackboard dusters are used to erase chalk markings on a chalkboard. Chalk writing leaves light-colored particles weakly adhering to a dark surface (e.g., white on black, or yellow on green); it can be rubbed off with a soft material, such as a rag. Erasers for chalkboards are made, with a block of plastic or wood, much larger than an eraser for pen or pencil, with a layer of felt on one side. The block is held in the hand and the felt rubbed against the writing, which it easily wipes off. Chalk dust is released, some of which sticks to the eraser until it is cleaned, usually by hitting it against a hard surface.

Various types of eraser, depending upon the board and the type of ink used, are used to erase a whiteboard.

Dedicated erasers that are supplied with some ballpens and permanent markers are intended only to erase the ink of the writing instrument they are made for; sometimes this is done by making the ink bond more strongly to the material of an eraser than the surface it was applied to.

<text>Jonathan Howsmon Davis (born January 18, 1971), also known as JD, is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He is the lead vocalist and frontman of nu metal band Korn, which is considered a pioneering act of the nu metal genre. Davis&#x27;s distinctive personality and Korn&#x27;s music influenced a generation of musicians and performers who have come after them.

Davis co-founded Korn in Bakersfield in 1993 with the dissolution of two bands, Sexart and L.A.P.D. He had led Sexart during his years as an assistant coroner. Davis rapidly gained notoriety for his intense and powerful live performances with Korn.

Anchored by his personal, passionate lyrics and unusual tenor vocals, Davis has launched a successful career which has spanned almost three decades. Davis&#x27;s vocals, which alternate from an angry tone to a high-pitched voice, switching from sounding atmospheric to aggressively screaming, have been the trademark of Korn throughout the band&#x27;s career.

From 2000 to 2001, Davis and Richard Gibbs wrote and produced the score and soundtrack album of &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, his first work outside the band. He began his side project called Jonathan Davis and the SFA in 2007 and continued to experiment with musical styles. He released his first solo album in 2018.

He has collaborated with various artists over the course of his career, ranging from metal to alternative rock, rap, world music, and electronic music. Davis is a multi-instrumentalist musician who plays guitar, drums, bagpipes, piano, upright bass, violin, and the clarinet. He is also versatile in many genres, mixing tracks and performs DJ sets with his alter ego JDevil. For decades, Davis has been passionate about visual arts, horror films, comics and video games.

Fourteen of his albums reached the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, including &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits, Vol. 1&quot;. In the U.S, he was awarded fifteen platinum album certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Australia, he received eight platinum album certifications by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and in the UK he received six gold certifications. He won two Grammy Awards out of eight nominations throughout his career. As of 2018, Davis has sold over 40 million albums worldwide.
==Early life==
Jonathan Howsmon Davis was born in Bakersfield, California, on January 18, 1971, the son of Holly Marie Chavez (&quot;née&quot; Smith; May 6, 1949 – February 25, 2018) and Ricky Duane &quot;Rick&quot; Davis (born December 14, 1948). His parents married on February 27, 1970. He is of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh descent.

He has a sister, Alyssa Marie Davis (born February 8, 1974), as well as a half-brother, Mark Chavez (lead singer of Adema; born November 15, 1978), and a half-sister, Amanda Chavez (born July 31, 1981) by his mother. His father was a keyboardist for Buck Owens and Frank Zappa, while his mother was a professional actress and dancer. His parents divorced when he was three years old. He lived with his mother at first, but, after experiencing bad situations at that home, he moved in with and was raised by his father and former stepmother in Bakersfield, but was made to feel like he &quot;came in and ruined their perfect little family.&quot; Davis suffered severe bouts of asthma as a child. Asthma forced him to stay in the hospital every month from the ages of 3 to 10, and he survived a &quot;critical asthma attack&quot; when he was five years old; he said, &quot;My heart stopped, and I didn&#x27;t see no damn light or hear any music&quot;.

He attended Highland High School; however, he was persistently harassed for wearing eyeliner, baggy clothes, and listening to new wave music. He was constantly called homophobic names, which later inspired the Korn song &quot;Faget&quot;. Davis&#x27;s &quot;HIV&quot; tattoo on his upper left arm was also inspired by his experience of being bullied. At the age of 16, Davis found employment as a coroner&#x27;s assistant; after graduating high school, he immediately enrolled in the San Francisco college&#x27;s one-year coronary program. He enjoyed his time in San Francisco, where he spent his days poring over embalming textbooks and his nights living and working in funeral homes. Nevertheless, he dropped out after two semesters to apprentice at a mortuary closer to home, in the Kern County Coroner&#x27;s Department. He was also a professional embalmer for a funeral home.

Davis commented in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;:
 &quot;I had post-traumatic stress from seeing dead babies, and young kids that had died after finding a parent&#x27;s stash of drugs – shit that I shouldn&#x27;t have been seeing at 16 or 17 years old. I had to have a lot of therapy to make the nightmares go away, but I got through it and it made me appreciate life a lot more.&quot;

He did not get along with his stepmom and has accused her of harassing him and doing things like giving him tea mixed with Thai hot oil and jalapeño juice to drink when he was sick. He also mentioned that she mixed tabasco with his tea. At that time, Davis had sexual fantasies about his stepmother, dreaming of &quot;fucking her and killing her&quot;. Though she was later divorced by Davis&#x27;s father, the Korn song &quot;Kill You&quot; was nonetheless written about her. In an interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Davis said that he left home when he was 18 because he felt like &quot;public enemy number one&quot;, since his stepmother—quoted as &quot;twisted and sadistic&quot;—hated him, and his own father was too embarrassed by the situation to do anything.

==Career==
===Early career===
Davis formed his first group with other members in a mysterious formation called Buck Naked, of which only two songs were recorded on demo tapes and distributed to his friends in High School; including New Wave-oriented song &quot;What I Have Done&quot;, and a love song &quot;Come With Me&quot;. Davis, who worked by day in a mortuary, got free haircuts at a college where guitarist Ryan Shuck was a student. Davis agreed to join Shuck&#x27;s group called Sexart, which was formed in 1991. Davis described the experience, &quot;I had no clue what I was doing, I didn&#x27;t know what the hell to do with my voice&quot;.

Early in 1993, ex-band members of L.A.P.D. who had started a new group named Creep, noticed Davis at The John Bryant club in Bakersfield, and were overwhelmed by his performance with Sexart. Davis, who was already a friend of Reginald Arvizu&#x27;s, was reluctant to join Creep, although he was flattered by the obstinacy of the musicians to integrate him into the group. Nevertheless, he only made the decision to audition with Creep after meeting the psychic who told him that it would be beneficial for him to leave Bakersfield, move to Los Angeles and join them. Davis left Sexart in his early 20s after a convincing rehearsal with the four Creep members; he commented: &quot;I was a little torn, because I was doing Sexart at the time, and that was my band. But I wanted to go and see what it was all about, and from the first note I was hooked. It just all clicked.&quot; Enticed by the prospect of a musical career, Davis resigned from his employment at Bakersfield judicial police, and moved to L.A. with his girlfriend to live with David Silveria and Brian Welch in the same house in Huntington Beach. Davis proposed the idea of naming the band as &#x27;Corn&#x27;—the spelling would be renamed right after as &#x27;KoЯn&#x27;—in reference to the horror film &quot;Children of the Corn&quot; and a sexually explicit story from his gay friend.

===Korn===

===Solo career===

Davis first began working on a solo album in 2007, forming the group Jonathan Davis and the SFA (Simply Fucking Amazings). Although he released two live albums with the group, no studio albums were completed and the band disbanded in 2014 after the death of guitarist Shane Gibson.

In December 2017, Davis began announcing solo tour dates and festival appearances and the launch of his solo album planned for 2018, which would mark Davis&#x27;s first billed simply as &quot;Jonathan Davis&quot;. He said of the album in a 2017 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; interview: &quot;It&#x27;s the Jonathan Davis And The SFA record, but JD SFA is no longer. Unfortunately, since Shane Gibson passed, that band&#x27;s done and it can&#x27;t be recreated. So this is J.D. right now.&quot;

In January 2018, Davis released his first solo single, &quot;What It Is&quot;. On January 26, 2018, he released the music video for &quot;What It Is&quot;, while the single was included on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;American Satan&quot;. At that time, Davis said he was &quot;a big fan&quot; of science fiction movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot;, and noted being an admirer of Vangelis. On May 25, 2018, he released his debut solo album, &quot;Black Labyrinth&quot; on Sumerian Records. The beginning of the writing process of &quot;Black Labyrinth&quot;—whose thematic focuses on &quot;religion, consumerism and apathy&quot;—was initiated on the road, back in 2007. Davis contributed mainly to the sound of the album, playing guitar, keys, and &quot;anything else he could get his hands on to the record&quot;.

On October 1, 2020, Davis released an alternate country version of &quot;What It Is&quot;.

===JDevil===

JDevil is the EDM alter ego of Davis. He has been DJing since 1987 while he was still in high school. At 16, before he joined Korn, Davis started out as a DJ working for Pacific West Sound and spun at high school dances and parties on the weekends in Bakersfield. At the time, his teachers were C-Minus, Choc, and Eric and Vidal. He used to spin New York freestyle, Miami bass, old school hip hop, goth, and industrial.

In 2009, he began to DJ again and he introduced JDevil to the world in 2011 at Infected Mushroom appearances.

In 2012, JDevil collaborated with Sluggo and California producer Tyler Blue, and while touring, he started working on an EP and writing every night in the studio of his tour bus. In March 2012 JDevil collaborated with Datsik and Infected Mushroom on a song called &quot;Evilution&quot;, the tracks would appear on Datsik&#x27;s debut album &quot;Vitamin D&quot;. JDevil was one of the opening acts for Korn on their The Path of Totality Tour from November 2011 – July 2012 in North America and Europe. While on a short break from touring with Korn in July 2012, JDevil had a short four-day club tour which consisted of The Junkyard in Nashua, New Hampshire, Pufferbellies Entertainment Complex in Hyannis, Massachusetts, Lizard Lounge in Dallas, Texas, and The Garden in El Paso, Texas.

In July 2012, JDevil had signed on to perform at select Identity Festival dates throughout North America. He only performed at two shows, Comcast Center (amphitheater) in Mansfield, Massachusetts, and Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow, Virginia.

In 2012, JDevil was supposed to open for Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson on their Twins of Evil Tour at select dates in North America, but had to drop out of the tour due to exhaustion. Davis stated it was very important for him to evolve in different styles after two decades in Korn, he said in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;It keeps me motivated. It keeps me being creative and not getting bored with music.&quot; In October 2012, Davis released his EP with his new group called Killbot, the EDM collective including Sluggo and Tyler Blue.

===Other projects===

In the early 2000s, while on tour, Davis was looking for artistic hobbies to satisfy his creative impulses and decided to team up with composer Richard Gibbs to write film soundtracks. Davis and Gibbs were introduced to each other through Zomba Music Group, which published their respective music at the time. Shortly after, Warner Bros. asked them to work on the movie &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, an adaptation of Anne Rice&#x27;s third novel in &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and a sequel to the 1994 film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. Ten songs will be composed by the two men, but only five have been kept. These songs include &quot;System&quot;, &quot;Redeemer&quot;, &quot;Forsaken&quot;, &quot;Slept So Long&quot; and &quot;Not Meant for Me&quot;, and sung by the band &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; in the movie. While Davis&#x27;s voice is heard performing the songs in the movie, through the singing voice of Lestat, contractual obligations kept his vocals from appearing on the soundtrack album released in 2002. Aaliyah, who died during filming, was supposed to record a duet with Davis.

In 2000, he created an original fighting game, &quot;Pop Scars&quot;, which pits popular musical personalities against each other in one-on-one combat. Participants included members of Limp Bizkit, Staind, Marilyn Manson, and Korn itself. Each celebrity has its own personality and sports character designs sketched by comic book artist Marty Emond, while stages feature environmental traps that impede opponents as they fight. &quot;Pop Scars&quot; never made it past the early design stages, as Davis himself pulled the plug on the project in late 2004.

In 2002, Davis was hired by New Line Television to write and record the theme music of UPN&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; television series, hosted by Forest Whitaker.

In 2007, he recorded original songs with Korn for the video game &quot;Haze&quot;.

In 2011, Konami hired Davis and Korn to compose the theme song to the video game &quot;Silent Hill: Downpour&quot;, which led to an online petition to stop the pairing.

He also created the title track for the 2022 video game &quot;ELEX II&quot;.

==Cameo appearances and acting==
Davis and Korn voiced themselves in season 3 of &quot;South Park&quot; in the episode &quot;Korn&#x27;s Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery&quot;, which features them as characters inspired by the cartoon &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, driving a van similar to the Mystery Machine and trying to solve a mystery about pirate ghosts.

Davis has also been featured in many other bands&#x27; music videos, sometimes with Korn and sometimes solo. He has appeared with Korn in the Limp Bizkit music videos for &quot;Break Stuff&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. He also appeared in the music video for &quot;Fire&quot; by Busta Rhymes.

In January 2000, Davis made an appearance at an Xtreme Pro Wrestling show as a guest ring announcer; he would be brought on by the host of that night&#x27;s event to announce the next match and its participants.

He has a cameo in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; as a ticket scalper.

Davis plays a minor role as Ricky, a crack dealer, in the film &quot;Seeing Other People&quot;.

Davis and the rest of Korn appeared in a 2005 episode of the comedy-drama television series &quot;Monk&quot;, titled &quot;Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic&quot;.

Davis also had a role as a store clerk in the 2007 independent film &quot;The Still Life&quot;.

In 2009, he collaborated with Infected Mushroom, appearing in the music video for their track &quot;Smashing the Opponent&quot;.

In 2012, JDevil appeared in the Datsik and Infected Mushroom music video for &quot;Evilution&quot;, wearing black eye contacts and fake teeth.

In August 2017, Davis voiced Succulentus in an episode of &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; titled &quot;Know Your Mom&quot;. The character was based on Davis and a parody of the nu-metal genre in general. The character&#x27;s dialogue consists of references to lyrics from nu metal songs.

In 2018, he also worked with the EDM group SKYND for their debut real crime song &quot;Gary Heidnik&quot;, appearing in the music video for it as well.

In February 2023, he collaborated with Kim Dracula for the song, &quot;Seventy Thorns&quot;, as well as appearing in the music video.

==Artistry==
===Vocal ability===

Davis is a tenor with a vocal range of four octaves and four notes (from A 1 to E 6). The vocal analysis of The Range Place website has a propensity to lower his higher register (from A1 to F5). In 2014, Davis appeared on the VVN Music&#x27;s list of &quot;the vocalists with the largest range&quot;. According to the vocal range data curated by The Range Place,

 His bizarre and esoteric vocal styles are definitely one of the main trademarks of the band, ranging from a gruff distorted sound to an odd dissonant scat as well as a lesser used soft headier sound. Earlier on, he used his more distorted tone almost exclusively for highs, however later on around the time of &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; he began demonstrating an ability to use more a cleaner which he can take to the lower fifth octave. His low range is fairly melodic down to at least F2/E2, with lower notes being more in the so-called &quot;attitude fry&quot; style, often used for a creepier or more intimidating effect. Davis&#x27;s voice is definitely a factor in what most consider to make or break Korn&#x27;s music for them, however he is definitely a unique staple of the 90s and modern rock scene.

Describing a live performance in Portland, Robert Ham of &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;not enough can be said about the versatility of Davis&#x27;s voice, as he explored all the different timbres at his disposal throughout the night. He growled, crooned and wailed with equal amounts of steady force&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; writer Essi Berelian described Davis&#x27;s singing voice: his &quot;unusual style varied between singing, half-rapping and breathless shrieking&quot;. Davis is renowned for his guttural—scat singing breakdowns; author Christopher Krovatin wrote that &quot;no aspect of Jonathan&#x27;s vocals are more widely recognized that his babbled nonsense words reminiscent of the scat vocals used by classic jazz musicians like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Benjamin &quot;Scatman&quot; Crothers&quot;. Tracks that include this aspect of his vocals in chronological order include the lead-off track in &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; &quot;Twist&quot;, &quot;Freak On A Leash&quot;, &quot;Got The Life&quot;, &quot;Children Of The Korn&quot;, &quot;B.B.K&quot;, &quot;Seed&quot;, &quot;Bottled Up Inside&quot;, &quot;Beat It Upright&quot;, &quot;Open Up&quot;, &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Tension&quot;, &quot;Rotting In Vain&quot;, &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, and &quot;Worst Is On Its Way&quot;.

===Influences===
Davis has said that his earliest musical inspiration during his childhood was the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, as his mother was one of the dancers in the movie. His interest in music was more stimulated when he discovered his synth-pop heroes, Duran Duran and the melodies of Simon Le Bon who became his major influence. He also grew up listening to &#x27;80s music such as Arcadia, Sigue Sigue Sputnik; Bauhaus, Depeche Mode, Thompson Twins; Missing Persons and Flock of Seagulls. Upon listening to his favorite musical genre, Davis would later say, &quot;I was a New Romantic! They even took me to the gay student&#x27;s counselor just because I wore makeup&quot;. He bought Mötley Crüe&#x27;s album &quot;Shout At The Devil&quot; when he was in seventh grade, then found Ministry, Skinny Puppy, and &quot;old goth stuff&quot; like Christian Death. Davis was first impressed with metal when he heard &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; by Pantera, he stated it was &quot;the metal record that made me wanna do heavy music&quot;. During adolescence, Davis played bagpipes on a regular basis. Many reviewers point out stark similarities between the vocals of Davis and several techniques employed by Mike Patton, and the former recognized Patton&#x27;s bands Faith No More and Mr. Bungle as major influences.

===Bagpipes===
Davis was interested in pipe band music during his youth, which prefigured later Korn&#x27;s use of bagpipes in several songs. His great-grandmother was from Scotland and played pipe records for him. Davis was also inspired to play the bagpipes by a scene in the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, in which the character Mr. Scott played &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; on the Great Highland bagpipes at the funeral of Mr. Spock. The melancholic sound captivated him. In a &quot;Loudwire&quot; interview, Davis described this moment while watching the film: &quot;everybody tears up, and I&#x27;m like...I gotta play bagpipes&quot;.
Davis&#x27;s enthusiasm led his grandmother to give him his first set of bagpipes, then he began by joining the Highland High School pipe band, and taking lessons from the band&#x27;s Scottish conductor. Shortly afterwards he went to a qualified teacher, who went to Scotland and learned. Davis started competing after that, across the United States at established gigs. When the band were ready to record their first album of original material, they realized that something was missing during the recording of the song &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot;. What had begun as &quot;a joke&quot; turned out to be nothing less than an atypical element in the song, and would eventually become the first Korn song to feature a Highland bagpipe.

Of Davis&#x27;s composition with Korn, Kelsey Chapstick commented in &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot;,
Davis does not want to make prominent use of the woodwind instrument and avoids what he worries might be gimmicked or over-use of the pipes. He clarified: &quot;it depends the song, if I&#x27;m feeling like there&#x27;s a spot where I could use it&quot;. Korn&#x27;s repertoire containing Davis&#x27;s bagpipes includes, &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot;, &quot;Low Rider&quot; (a cover of the song by funk rock band War) from Korn&#x27;s album&quot; Life is Peachy&quot;. Bagpipes are also heard on &quot;My Gift To You&quot;, &quot;Dead&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do This Now&quot;, &quot;10 or a 2-Way&quot;, &quot;Open Up&quot;, &quot;Liar&quot;, &quot;Seen It All&quot;, &quot;I Will Protect You&quot;, &quot;Lead The Parade&quot;, &quot;Spike In My Veins&quot;, &quot;Bleeding Out&quot;, and &quot;The End Begins&quot;. On November 15, 1999, at the Apollo Theater concert, the NYPD Pipes and Drums corps opened the show with &quot;Dead&quot;. On July 23, 1999, Davis performed his bagpipe routine in front of more than 250,000 attendees during the Korn concert at the &quot;Woodstock Festival&quot; in New York in a long weekend of anarchy and uproar.

==Equipment==

Four months before the release of &quot;Untouchables&quot;, in March 2002, during a South America tour, Davis unveiled a microphone stand art piece named &quot;The Bitch&quot;, which was created and conceptualized by Swiss artist H.R. Giger. Davis being a fan of Giger&#x27;s work, the initial idea of a special microphone stand was suggested to him by his personal assistant Jonathan Pavesi. Then, Davis contacted Giger and was pleased when the Swiss artist accepted a commission to come up with a design for the mic stand. He asked Giger for a microphone stand that was both &quot;biomechanical and very erotic&quot;, giving him complete freedom of design. In 2000, during the European &quot;Issues&quot; tour, Davis visited the H.R. Giger Museum in Switzerland. Further discussions of Giger&#x27;s drawings took place, and over time the figure became more streamlined. H.R. Giger and his assistant Roni emailed photos of the progress to the United States; during this process Davis gave his approval and asked him for some minor adjustments, so he could grab it more easily for his live performances. Giger said that Davis&#x27;s only concern was that it had been &quot;totally functional and as movable as possible&quot;. Only five bio-mechanical mic stands cast in the shape of a woman were manufactured at a foundry in Zürich, from molds that were then destroyed, adding to their historic allure and value. Davis had received three of the bio-mechanical microphone stands, and Giger kept the other two, one for permanent display at the H.R. Giger Museum and another for his gallery exhibitions.
Davis has been sponsored by Shure microphones since the mid 1990s and continues to use them for live performances. He has used wireless KSM9 and KSM8 models in recent years. Davis uses a variety of microphones in the studio including the Telefunken U47 and ELA M 251.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Davis&#x27;s childhood is a major influence on Korn lyrics—the song &quot;Daddy&quot; gave rise to a rumor that he was molested by his father, Rick Davis. However, Jonathan has gone on record in many interviews saying he wrote the song about a female family friend who sexually abused him. He said that when he tried to turn to his family as a child to tell them about the abuse, they shrugged it off and did not believe him.

Davis has been married twice. His first marriage was to his high school sweetheart Renee Perez. They were married in 1998, had a son named Nathan (who also produces music as part of the Bass music-Duo &quot;Hi I&#x27;m Ghost&quot;) in 1995, and divorced in 2000. Jonathan married Deven Davis in 2004. The couple have two sons, Pirate and Zeppelin. He filed for divorce in October 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. In 2018, a domestic violence restraining order was issued, blocking any child custody or visitation by Deven, whom Jonathan alleged was deep into drugs. Deven Davis died on August 17, 2018, at the age of 39 of combined drug intoxication from heroin and various prescription drugs.

===Health and substance abuse===
Davis had a history of excessive methamphetamine abuse and alcohol consumption during the recording sessions of &quot;Korn&quot; and &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot;. Subsequently, he recorded &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; under the influence of methamphetamine, cocaine, and a heavy reliance on alcohol (especially Jack Daniel&#x27;s). In an interview with &quot;The Ringer&quot;, Davis described the album&#x27;s creation &quot;fueled by cocaine, speed, and just constant gallons of Jack Daniel&#x27;s&quot;. Davis got himself off methamphetamine addiction when he was 28 during the fall&#x27;s inaugural Family Values Tour. However, sobriety has increased his anxiety and depression which co-occurred with his substance use, exacerbated by the death of his grandfather at that time. During this period, from the late &#x27;90s to the early 2000s, Davis was put on suicide watch. In 2010, he admitted that he missed his past vices, Davis said &quot;I know if I did (take drugs), I would be dead and I want to be with my children. It&#x27;s a deterrent&quot;.

In 2013, Davis was treated for Xanax addiction, and openly smoked marijuana until 2015. In 2018, Davis stated in &quot;Forbes&quot; that he continues to struggle with chronic anxiety, depression, and insomnia, but has replaced drugs and alcohol with medication such as Prozac, Halcion, Benadryl, ZzzQuil, NyQuil, and Melatonin.

On August 14, 2021, Davis tested positive for coronavirus. As a result, Korn postponed six summer dates on their U.S. tour and canceled two dates in New York. Korn resumed touring on August 27, 2021, at Tinley Park, Illinois, where the stage featured a custom throne for Davis to sit in. He was seen moving slowly around the stage, coughing, appearing to struggle catching his breath, and occasionally using an oxygen tank. On August 29, Brian Welch posted a video remarking on his bandmate&#x27;s health, stating, &quot;Jonathan Davis is still struggling with the COVID after-effects. He&#x27;s physically weak and having a mental battle. And any type of love, light and energy you can throw at him – prayers, all of it. ... He needs you more than ever.&quot;

===Art and serial killers collectibles===

In the early 2000s, Davis began collecting serial killer art and memorabilia, publicly displaying selected items while on the Ozzfest 2003 tour. Some items owned by Davis include the Volkswagen serial killer Ted Bundy drove for the duration of his murder spree; the &quot;Pogo&quot; and &quot;Patches&quot; clown outfits worn by serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the 1928 confession letter from cannibal Albert Fish; and original drawings by serial killer Richard Ramirez (also known as the &quot;Night Stalker)&quot;.

In June 2001, the collector of criminal artifacts Arthur Rosenblatt was approached by Davis. Rosenblatt told him of his plan to open a museum of artifacts related to the criminal justice system, which Rosenblatt suggested be named the &quot;Museum of Justice &amp; Odditorium&quot; or &quot;MOJO Museum&quot;. In March 2003, Davis suggested funding the museum through a film or TV production. Subsequently, Davis pulled out of the deal which fell apart, leading Rosenblatt to sue him twice; Rosenblatt accused Davis of having spoken to the media in 2002 about his museum project with artist Joe Coleman and mis-naming it &quot;American Curiosities Museum&quot; when he should have used the names provided for in the contract. In the lawsuit, Rosenblatt claimed that Davis and other partners have threatened his life on several occasions. Nevertheless, in December 2005, Davis started selling off his serial killer memorabilia, claiming his desire to move away from this environment, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t want that around my kids&quot;. In 2006, the litigation was ultimately resolved successfully by Ed McPherson, Davis&#x27;s attorney. Davis later denounced the items and got rid of them.

Davis made an appearance in the &quot;Oddities&quot; documentary series, in the fourth episode of season two entitled &quot;Rock Star Embalmer&quot;, which was filmed at Manhattan&#x27;s Obscura Antiques &amp; Oddities. The episode aired on Discovery Channel on April 30, 2011.

Davis&#x27;s home houses a private art collection that spans decades of touring the globe. He has a considerable and diverse collection of works of macabre and dark art, such as a limited edition Ibanez guitar designed by H.R. Giger that looks the same as his mic stand, a human shrunken head from South America, and a human foetus called &#x27;Luther&#x27;. His art collection also includes religious art from all over the world and a variety of religions, such as 600-year-old Buddhist sculptures and &quot;tons of crucifixes&quot;, especially Mexican Jesus. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I like religion, but I like the art&quot;, reaffirms Davis.

He has also developed an interest in collection of taxidermy art. In 2015 during an interview with Gavin Lloyd for &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; he said &quot;the taxidermy I got on the walls, I got when we were touring in South Africa. I hired a guide, stalked those animals, shot both of them and donated the meat, which fed families for months. ... I had to wait a year to get those heads back from Africa, but they&#x27;re top notch, they&#x27;re amazing.&quot;

===Political views===
In 2006, Davis explained his political views, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m political to a point where it affects human life, from global warming to abortion issues to my gun rights&quot;, but expressed no interest in issues like taxation, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care. Obviously even going out and voting doesn&#x27;t really count, it&#x27;s all based down to these Electoral College votes.&quot; Davis has expressed support for same-sex marriage and transgender people.

Davis has expressed support for libertarian Republican candidates Ron Paul and Rand Paul. Davis once described Barack Obama as an &quot;Illuminati puppet&quot;, and told &quot;Billboard&quot; that Obama had &quot;basically dragged this country down into the worst it&#x27;s ever been.&quot; In 2014, Davis said that the United States was becoming a &quot;police state&quot;.

===Religion===
In an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine, Davis stated that he&#x27;s &quot;always been a believer in God&quot;, just not in organized religion. He also criticized born-again Christians for &quot;broadcasting&quot; their beliefs.

==Military visits==
In 2012, Davis began visiting United States Armed Forces stationed in Europe. On March 16, 2012, Davis made his first visit to Ramstein Air Base, Germany where he visited with personnel assigned to the 86th Airlift Wing and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel showed him how to operate the bomb disposal robot and how to render safe an improvised explosive device wearing a Bombsuit. Firefighter personnel showed how to use the water cannon in the new Striker ARFF fire apparatus. Readiness and emergency management personnel showed a variety of Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) detection and protection equipment. He also did a meet and greet signing autographs for the troops and their families at the AAFES Military Mall (Kaiserslautern Military Community Center). He visited wounded warriors from all over the world at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the USO Wounded Warriors Center.

On August 11, 2012, Davis made another trip to Ramstein Air Base, Germany to visit with personnel assigned to the 86th Airlift Wing, 37th Airlift Squadron, and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. During this visit, he was able to get a tour of a C-130J, Hercules and Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel demonstrated a &quot;Hollywood shot&quot; explosive and the destruction a small amount of explosive can do to a car. Again, he visited the wounded warriors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and the USO Wounded Warriors Center. A documentary of his experiences, &quot;Wounded Warriors&quot; was submitted to the 1st Annual GI Film Festival Hollywood, and won Audience Choice Award on November 10, 2012. As a result of these trips, once Barack Obama awarded Captain Florent Groberg the Medal of Honor, he mentioned how Davis visited Groberg in Germany, and joked that &quot;I am not the lead singer from Korn&quot;. While Davis had been a vocal critic of Obama, he expressed shock at the mention, particularly as it was a compliment: &quot;The President of the United States gave me props for being there for a Medal of Honor recipient. Groberg went through hell.&quot;

<doc id="479382" wikidata="Q617634" url="?curid=479382" title="Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936">
<text>The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 (officially, &quot;The Treaty of Alliance Between His Majesty, in Respect of the United Kingdom, and His Majesty, the King of Egypt&quot;) was a treaty signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt. The treaty significantly reduced Britain’s influence in Egypt’s domestic policy but Britain still had significant influence in Egypt’s foreign policy and defense, especially the Suez Canal. 

Under the terms of the treaty, the United Kingdom was required to withdraw all its troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings, numbering 10,000 troops plus auxiliary personnel. Additionally, the United Kingdom would supply and train Egypt&#x27;s army and assist in its defence in case of war. The treaty was to last for 20 years; it was negotiated in the Zaafarana palace, signed in London on 26 August 1936 and ratified on 22 December. It was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on 6 January 1937.

==Background==

In November 1918, seven prominent Egyptians from the landed gentry and the legal profession, including Sa&#x27;d Zaghlul, formed a delegation, or &quot;wafd&quot;, whose chief goal was the complete independence of Egypt from British rule. But when the &quot;wafd&quot; asked the British High Commissioner in Egypt if they could represent the country at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, he refused. As a result, the delegation organisers took their message of independence to the people of Egypt and this led to the founding of one of the most popular political parties in modern Egyptian history.

Wafdist leaders thought that the ideas of independence and constitutional government were closely related and they had someone to model themselves after - the British. Following the proclamation of the Egyptian Constitution of 1923 the 1923–24 Egyptian parliamentary elections were held. Many European-educated Egyptians believed that the mere existence of a constitution and a parliament would legitimise Egyptian claims for complete independence.

But Egyptian democratic independence ran into many obstacles; the nature of the constitution gave many powers to the king, including the power to dissolve parliament. So the king used this constitutional power to get rid of parliament when they went against his wishes, culminating in many periods of royal rule. The British also continued to meddle in Egyptian politics, and they did not allow for a fully independent political apparatus to develop. Also the &quot;Wafd&quot; party and other minor political parties never created a coalition to stand together against the British, instead they held each other in contempt. The result of these obstacles was a constant struggle for power between the British-backed King Fuad I, and the &quot;Wafd&quot; party that sought complete independence from the British.

The intense desire for real independence was only partially fulfilled in 1936, when Britain agreed to renegotiate the 1922 declaration of independence, because of Italian expansionism into Ethiopia in 1935.

Among the pretexts for the treaty was the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, which had started in 1935. King Farouk feared that the Italians might invade Egypt or drag it into the fighting. The 1936 treaty did not resolve the question of Sudan, which, under the terms of the existing Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899, stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain, but with real power remaining in British hands. With rising tension in Europe, the treaty expressly favoured maintaining the status quo. The treaty, however, was not welcomed by Egyptian nationalists like the Arab Socialist Party, who wanted full independence. It ignited a wave of demonstrations against the British and the Wafd Party, which had supported the treaty.

==Treaty signing==
The Treaty was signed in the Locarno Room at the Foreign Office building in London on 27 August 1936. The principal signatories were Egyptian premier Nahas Pasha and British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden.

Other signatories included Ramsay MacDonald, Mahmoud Pasha, Lord Halifax, Sir John Simon, Ismail Sidky Pasha, Makram Ebeid Pasha, Sir Miles Lampson and Amin Osman.

==Treaty provisions==
* Removal of British military forces from the Egyptian cities to the Suez Canal area but British soldiers in Sudan remain unconditionally.
* The number of British troops in Egypt to number no more than 10 thousand soldiers and 400 pilots with the staff required for administrative and technical work in peacetime only, while during a state of war the UK has the right to increase the number.
* British forces are not transferred to new areas until new barracks are built.
* British troops remain in Alexandria eight years from the date of the Treaty
* British air forces remain in the camp in the Canal Zone and are entitled to use Egyptian air space and the same right is given to Egyptian aircraft.
* In case of war the Egyptian government is committed to provide all facilities and assistance to the British forces including the right to use Egyptian ports and airports and roads.
* After 20 years from the implementation of the Treaty parties it shall be determined if the presence of British troops is necessary as the Egyptian army may be able to guarantee shipping in the Suez Canal safely. Disagreements may be submitted to the League of Nations.
* Egypt has the right to demand the abolition of foreign privileges.
* Cancel all agreements and documents contrary to the provisions of this Treaty including the February 28 statement
* The return of the Egyptian army to Sudan and the recognition of joint management with Britain.
* Freedom of Egypt to make treaties with foreign countries, provided that these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Treaty.
* Exchange ambassadors with the United Kingdom.

==Aftermath==
On 23 September 1945, after the end of World War II, the Egyptian government demanded the modification of the treaty to terminate the British military presence, and also to allow the annexation of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. In 1946, Britain agreed to withdraw all remaining troops in Egypt into the Suez Canal Zone. In 1947, UK troops officially withdrew from all other Egyptian bases outside the Suez Canal Zone. Following the Wafd Party&#x27;s victory in the boycotted 1950 election of Egypt, the new Wafd government unilaterally abrogated the treaty in October 1951. Three years later, and with new government leadership under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the UK agreed to withdraw its troops in the Anglo–Egyptian Agreement of 1954; the British withdrawal was completed in June 1956. This date is seen as when Egypt gained full independence, although Nasser had already established an independent foreign policy that caused tension with several Western powers.

Following the abrupt withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the building of the Aswan Dam, Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956, ostensibly to pay for the dam, although in reality the Soviets provided most of the funding. The nationalisation was technically in violation of the international agreement that Nasser had signed on 19 October 1954, although he agreed to pay compensation to the shareholders. Some months later, France, Israel and Britain colluded to overthrow Nasser, and the Suez Crisis ensued. After international pressure and threats from the 2 new superpowers (the United States and the USSR), Britain, France and Israel were all forced to withdraw from Egypt, and the canal remained under Egyptian control.

<doc id="479383" wikidata="Q4157138" url="?curid=479383" title="David Milgaard">
<text>David Milgaard (July 7, 1952 – May 15, 2022) was a Canadian man who was wrongfully convicted for the 1969 rape and murder of nursing student Gail Miller in Saskatoon and imprisoned for 23 years. He was eventually released and exonerated. Up until his death, he lived in Alberta and was employed as a community support worker. Milgaard was also a public speaker who advocated for the wrongfully convicted and for all prisoners&#x27; rights.

== Arrest, trial and exoneration ==
In January 1969, 16-year-old Milgaard and his friends Ron Wilson and Nichol John embarked on a trip across Canada. The three were in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, visiting their friend Albert Cadrain when a 20-year-old nursing student, Gail Miller, was found dead on a snowbank in the vicinity of the Cadrain home. Under pressure to solve a crime that had generated significant publicity, police focused their attention on Milgaard, Wilson and John. In an attempt to clear his name and assist the investigation, Milgaard turned himself in to police in Prince George, British Columbia. Police sent him back to Saskatoon, where he was charged with Miller&#x27;s murder. Milgaard&#x27;s friends John and Wilson were coerced by police into giving false confessions. Cadrain also gave a false confession and later testified that he had seen Milgaard return the night of Miller&#x27;s murder in blood-stained clothing. Wilson and John told police they had been with him the entire day and they believed him to be innocent, but changed their stories after police threatened them with prosecution if they did not cooperate.

With Cadrain, John and Wilson&#x27;s testimony, then-17-year-old Milgaard was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on January 31, 1970, exactly a year after Miller&#x27;s murder. In 1971, Milgaard&#x27;s appeal was rejected by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear his appeal. Milgaard later wrote of the hardships he faced in prison, where he was raped and later attempted suicide.

=== Exoneration ===
Milgaard&#x27;s lawyers and his mother, Joyce, worked for many years on clearing his name. A formal application for appeal was completed in 1988, but was not considered until 1991 when the federal government submitted a reference question to the Supreme Court of Canada, which recommended Milgaard&#x27;s conviction be set aside. Kim Campbell, the federal minister of justice at the time, ordered that pursuant to section 690 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, a new trial be held on the murder charge against Milgaard. However, the government of Saskatchewan announced it would not do so, instead entering a stay of proceedings in the case against Milgaard, releasing him from prison on April 16, 1992.

On July 18, 1997, a DNA laboratory in the United Kingdom released a report confirming that semen samples on the victim&#x27;s clothing did not originate from Milgaard, effectively exonerating Milgaard of the crime.

On May 17, 1999, the governments of Canada and Saskatchewan announced that a settlement had been reached with Milgaard, and that he would be paid C$10 million compensation for pain and suffering, lost wages and legal fees.

=== Inquiry ===
On September 30, 2003, the Saskatchewan government announced a royal commission would investigate Milgaard&#x27;s wrongful conviction. On February 20, 2004, Justice Edward P. MacCallum was announced as the commissioner.

On September 26, 2008, the Saskatchewan Minister of Justice, Don Morgan, released the findings of the Milgaard inquiry. Among its recommendations were a call for the federal government to create an independent body to review allegations of wrongful conviction. The report noted that if such a body had existed, Milgaard might have been released from jail years earlier than he actually was. Linda Fisher, ex-wife of Larry Fisher, visited the Saskatoon police department in 1980. She told the police that she believed her former husband had likely killed Miller. The Saskatoon police department did not follow up on her statement. The inquiry report released by MacCallum states that, &quot;while MacCallum noted that Milgaard&#x27;s family members mounted a formidable public awareness campaign, their efforts also created tension and resentment within the police and the Crown&#x27;s office.&quot;

=== Real killer ===
 The DNA evidence that exonerated Milgaard led police to Larry Earl Fisher (August 21, 1949 – June 10, 2015), who was renting the basement of the Cadrain family home in January 1969. Fisher was arrested on July 25, 1997, in Calgary and convicted of Miller&#x27;s murder on November 22, 1999. Fisher, who had previously served a total of 23 years for numerous rapes committed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, was handed a life sentence. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan unanimously denied the appeal of his conviction in September 2003.

Fisher was eligible for parole on multiple occasions, but opted not to have his case heard by the National Parole Board. He died on June 10, 2015, at the Pacific Institution in Abbotsford, British Columbia.

== Life after release ==
After his release, Milgaard married his partner Cristina. Together, they had two children, a son and a daughter. As of January 2020, Milgaard was living in Cochrane, Alberta. In 2021 he posted several videos on his YouTube channel Project Milgaard. He had recently been appointed to the Independent Review Board Working Group, an entity whose creation was ordered by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December 2019. A news item stated that &quot;he has helped in the fight for the creation of a review board for cases of wrongful conviction.&quot;

Milgaard became ill on May 14, 2022. He was taken to a hospital in Calgary, where he died the following day at the age of 69 from complications of pneumonia.

== Legacy ==
In February 2023, Justice Minister David Lametti introduced a bill called the &quot;David and Joyce Milgaard&#x27;s Law&quot; which would create a new, independent commission to investigate potential wrongful conviction cases and refer them back to the justice system.

==In popular culture ==
The Milgaard case has been the subject of two movies: the 1992 documentary &quot;The David Milgaard Story&quot;, directed by Vic Sarin, and the 1999 docudrama &quot;Milgaard&quot;, directed by Stephen Williams and starring Ian Tracey.

The song &quot;Wheat Kings&quot; by the Tragically Hip (from their 1992 album &quot;Fully Completely&quot;) contains references to the story.

Canadian artist David Collier described the Milgaard case in comics form in his 2000 book &quot;Surviving Saskatoon&quot;.

<doc id="479385" wikidata="Q2914458" url="?curid=479385" title="Extracellular fluid">
<text>In cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 50–60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men. Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells. The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells. 

Extracellular fluid is the internal environment of all multicellular animals, and in those animals with a blood circulatory system, a proportion of this fluid is blood plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are the two components that make up at least 97% of the ECF. Lymph makes up a small percentage of the interstitial fluid. The remaining small portion of the ECF includes the transcellular fluid (about 2.5%). The ECF can also be seen as having two components – plasma and lymph as a delivery system, and interstitial fluid for water and solute exchange with the cells.

The extracellular fluid, in particular the interstitial fluid, constitutes the body&#x27;s internal environment that bathes all of the cells in the body. The ECF composition is therefore crucial for their normal functions, and is maintained by a number of homeostatic mechanisms involving negative feedback. Homeostasis regulates, among others, the pH, sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations in the ECF. The volume of body fluid, blood glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels are also tightly homeostatically maintained.

The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg (154 lbs) is 20% of body weight – about fourteen liters. Eleven liters are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma.

== Components ==
The main component of the extracellular fluid (ECF) is the interstitial fluid, or tissue fluid, which surrounds the cells in the body. The other major component of the ECF is the intravascular fluid of the circulatory system called blood plasma. The remaining small percentage of ECF includes the transcellular fluid. These constituents are often called &quot;fluid compartments&quot;. The volume of extracellular fluid in a young adult male of 70 kg, is 20% of body weight – about fourteen liters.

===Interstitial fluid===
Interstitial fluid is essentially comparable to plasma. The interstitial fluid and plasma make up about 97% of the ECF, and a small percentage of this is lymph.

Interstitial fluid is the body fluid between blood vessels and cells, containing nutrients from capillaries by diffusion and holding waste products discharged by cells due to metabolism. 11 liters of the ECF are interstitial fluid and the remaining three liters are plasma. Plasma and interstitial fluid are very similar because water, ions, and small solutes are continuously exchanged between them across the walls of capillaries, through pores and capillary clefts.

Interstitial fluid consists of a water solvent containing sugars, salts, fatty acids, amino acids, coenzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, white blood cells and cell waste-products. This solution accounts for 26% of the water in the human body. The composition of interstitial fluid depends upon the exchanges between the cells in the biological tissue and the blood. This means that tissue fluid has a different composition in different tissues and in different areas of the body.

The plasma that filters through the blood capillaries into the interstitial fluid does not contain red blood cells or platelets as they are too large to pass through but can contain some white blood cells to help the immune system.

Once the extracellular fluid collects into small vessels (lymph capillaries) it is considered to be lymph, and the vessels that carry it back to the blood are called the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic system returns protein and excess interstitial fluid to the circulation.

The ionic composition of the interstitial fluid and blood plasma vary due to the Gibbs–Donnan effect. This causes a slight difference in the concentration of cations and anions between the two fluid compartments.

===Transcellular fluid===
Transcellular fluid is formed from the transport activities of cells, and is the smallest component of extracellular fluid. These fluids are contained within epithelial lined spaces. Examples of this fluid are cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor in the eye, serous fluid in the serous membranes lining body cavities, perilymph and endolymph in the inner ear, and joint fluid. Due to the varying locations of transcellular fluid, the composition changes dramatically. Some of the electrolytes present in the transcellular fluid are sodium ions, chloride ions, and bicarbonate ions.

== Function ==
Extracellular fluid provides the medium for the exchange of substances between the ECF and the cells, and this can take place through dissolving, mixing and transporting in the fluid medium. Substances in the ECF include dissolved gases, nutrients, and electrolytes, all needed to maintain life. ECF also contains materials secreted from cells in soluble form, but which quickly coalesce into fibers (e.g. collagen, reticular, and elastic fibres) or precipitates out into a solid or semisolid form (e.g. proteoglycans which form the bulk of cartilage, and the components of bone). These and many other substances occur, especially in association with various proteoglycans, to form the extracellular matrix, or the &quot;filler&quot; substance, between the cells throughout the body. These substances occur in the extracellular space, and are therefore all bathed or soaked in ECF, without being part of it.

== Oxygenation ==
One of the main roles of extracellular fluid is to facilitate the exchange of molecular oxygen from blood to tissue cells and for carbon dioxide, CO2, produced in cell mitochondria, back to the blood. Since carbon dioxide is about 20 times more soluble in water than oxygen, it can relatively easily diffuse in the aqueous fluid between cells and blood.

However, hydrophobic molecular oxygen has very poor water solubility and prefers hydrophobic lipid crystalline structures. As a result of this, plasma lipoproteins can carry significantly more O2 than in the surrounding aqueous medium.

If hemoglobin in erythrocytes is the main transporter of oxygen in the blood, plasma lipoproteins may be its only carrier in the ECF.

The oxygen-carrying capacity of lipoproteins, reduces in ageing and inflammation. This results in changes of ECF functions, reduction of tissue O2 supply and contributes to development of tissue hypoxia. These changes in lipoproteins are caused by oxidative or inflammatory damage.

==Regulation==
The internal environment is stabilised in the process of homeostasis. Complex homeostatic mechanisms operate to regulate and keep the composition of the ECF stable. Individual cells can also regulate their internal composition by various mechanisms.
There is a significant difference between the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions inside and outside the cell. The concentration of sodium ions is considerably higher in the extracellular fluid than in the intracellular fluid. The converse is true of the potassium ion concentrations inside and outside the cell. These differences cause all cell membranes to be electrically charged, with the positive charge on the outside of the cells and the negative charge on the inside. In a resting neuron (not conducting an impulse) the membrane potential is known as the resting potential, and between the two sides of the membrane is about −70 mV.

This potential is created by sodium–potassium pumps in the cell membrane, which pump sodium ions out of the cell, into the ECF, in return for potassium ions which enter the cell from the ECF. The maintenance of this difference in the concentration of ions between the inside of the cell and the outside, is critical to keep normal cell volumes stable, and also to enable some cells to generate action potentials.

In several cell types voltage-gated ion channels in the cell membrane can be temporarily opened under specific circumstances for a few microseconds at a time. This allows a brief inflow of sodium ions into the cell (driven in by the sodium ion concentration gradient that exists between the outside and inside of the cell). This causes the cell membrane to temporarily depolarize (lose its electrical charge) forming the basis of action potentials.

The sodium ions in the ECF also play an important role in the movement of water from one body compartment to the other. When tears are secreted, or saliva is formed, sodium ions are pumped from the ECF into the ducts in which these fluids are formed and collected. The water content of these solutions results from the fact that water follows the sodium ions (and accompanying anions) osmotically. The same principle applies to the formation of many other body fluids.

Calcium ions have a great propensity to bind to proteins. This changes the distribution of electrical charges on the protein, with the consequence that the 3D (or tertiary) structure of the protein is altered. The normal shape, and therefore function of very many of the extracellular proteins, as well as the extracellular portions of the cell membrane proteins, is dependent on a very precise ionized calcium concentration in the ECF. The proteins that are particularly sensitive to changes in the ECF ionized calcium concentration are several of the clotting factors in the blood plasma, which are functionless in the absence of calcium ions, but become fully functional on the addition of the correct concentration of calcium salts. The voltage gated sodium ion channels in the cell membranes of nerves and muscle have an even greater sensitivity to changes in the ECF ionized calcium concentration. Relatively small decreases in the plasma ionized calcium levels (hypocalcemia) cause these channels to leak sodium into the nerve cells or axons, making them hyper-excitable, thus causing spontaneous muscle spasms (tetany) and paraesthesia (the sensation of &quot;pins and needles&quot;) of the extremities and round the mouth. When the plasma ionized calcium rises above normal (hypercalcemia) more calcium is bound to these sodium channels having the opposite effect, causing lethargy, muscle weakness, anorexia, constipation and labile emotions.

The tertiary structure of proteins is also affected by the pH of the bathing solution. In addition, the pH of the ECF affects the proportion of the total amount of calcium in the plasma which occurs in the free, or ionized form, as opposed to the fraction that is bound to protein and phosphate ions. A change in the pH of the ECF therefore alters the ionized calcium concentration of the ECF. Since the pH of the ECF is directly dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the ECF, hyperventilation, which lowers the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the ECF, produces symptoms that are almost indistinguishable from low plasma ionized calcium concentrations.

The extracellular fluid is constantly &quot;stirred&quot; by the circulatory system, which ensures that the watery environment which bathes the body&#x27;s cells is virtually identical throughout the body. This means that nutrients can be secreted into the ECF in one place (e.g. the gut, liver, or fat cells) and will, within about a minute, be evenly distributed throughout the body. Hormones are similarly rapidly and evenly spread to every cell in the body, regardless of where they are secreted into the blood. Oxygen taken up by the lungs from the alveolar air is also evenly distributed at the correct partial pressure to all the cells of the body. Waste products are also uniformly spread to the whole of the ECF, and are removed from this general circulation at specific points (or organs), once again ensuring that there is generally no localized accumulation of unwanted compounds or excesses of otherwise essential substances (e.g. sodium ions, or any of the other constituents of the ECF). The only significant exception to this general principle is the plasma in the veins, where the concentrations of dissolved substances in individual veins differ, to varying degrees, from those in the rest of the ECF. However, this plasma is confined within the waterproof walls of the venous tubes, and therefore does not affect the interstitial fluid in which the body&#x27;s cells live. When the blood from all the veins in the body mixes in the heart and lungs, the differing compositions cancel out (e.g. acidic blood from active muscles is neutralized by the alkaline blood homeostatically produced by the kidneys). From the left atrium onward, to every organ in the body, the normal, homeostatically regulated values of all of the ECF&#x27;s components are therefore restored.

==Interaction between the blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph==

The arterial blood plasma, interstitial fluid and lymph interact at the level of the blood capillaries. The capillaries are permeable and water can move freely in and out. At the arteriolar end of the capillary the blood pressure is greater than the hydrostatic pressure in the tissues. Water will therefore seep out of the capillary into the interstitial fluid. The pores through which this water moves are large enough to allow all the smaller molecules (up to the size of small proteins such as insulin) to move freely through the capillary wall as well. This means that their concentrations across the capillary wall equalize, and therefore have no osmotic effect (because the osmotic pressure caused by these small molecules and ions – called the crystalloid osmotic pressure to distinguish it from the osmotic effect of the larger molecules that cannot move across the capillary membrane – is the same on both sides of capillary wall).

The movement of water out of the capillary at the arteriolar end causes the concentration of the substances that cannot cross the capillary wall to increase as the blood moves to the venular end of the capillary. The most important substances that are confined to the capillary tube are plasma albumin, the plasma globulins and fibrinogen. They, and particularly the plasma albumin, because of its molecular abundance in the plasma, are responsible for the so-called &quot;oncotic&quot; or &quot;colloid&quot; osmotic pressure which draws water back into the capillary, especially at the venular end.

The net effect of all of these processes is that water moves out of and back into the capillary, while the crystalloid substances in the capillary and interstitial fluids equilibrate. Since the capillary fluid is constantly and rapidly renewed by the flow of the blood, its composition dominates the equilibrium concentration that is achieved in the capillary bed. This ensures that the watery environment of the body&#x27;s cells is always close to their ideal environment (set by the body&#x27;s homeostats).

A small proportion of the solution that leaks out of the capillaries is not drawn back into the capillary by the colloid osmotic forces. This amounts to between 2–4 liters per day for the body as a whole. This water is collected by the lymphatic system and is ultimately discharged into the left subclavian vein, where it mixes with the venous blood coming from the left arm, on its way to the heart. The lymph flows through lymph capillaries to lymph nodes where bacteria and tissue debris are removed from the lymph, while various types of white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) are added to the fluid. In addition the lymph which drains the small intestine contains fat droplets called chylomicrons after the ingestion of a fatty meal. This lymph is called chyle which has a milky appearance, and imparts the name lacteals (referring to the milky appearance of their contents) to the lymph vessels of the small intestine.

Extracellular fluid may be mechanically guided in this circulation by the vesicles between other structures. Collectively this forms the interstitium, which may be considered a newly identified biological structure in the body. However, there is some debate over whether the interstitium is an organ.

<text>Issues relating to the State of Israel and aspects of the Arab–Israeli conflict, and more recently the Iran–Israel conflict, occupy repeated annual debate times, resolutions and resources at the United Nations. Since its founding in 1948, the United Nations Security Council, has adopted 79 resolutions directly related to the Arab–Israeli conflict as of January 2010.

The adoption on 29 November 1947, by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan of partition of Mandatory Palestine was one of the earliest acts of the United Nations. This followed the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. Since then, it has maintained a central role in this region, including the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People. The UN has sponsored several peace negotiations between the parties, the latest being the 2002 Road map for peace.

== History ==
=== UN Partition Plan for Palestine ===

The United Nations General Assembly on 15 May 1947 created the Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) in response to a United Kingdom government request that the General Assembly &quot;make recommendations under article 10 of the Charter, concerning the future government of Palestine&quot;. UNSCOP was &quot;to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine.&quot; UNSCOP consisted of representatives of eleven members: Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay and Yugoslavia. In the final report of 3 September 1947, seven members of the Committee in Chapter VI &quot;expressed themselves, by recorded vote, in favour of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union&quot; (reproduced in the Report). The Plan proposed &quot;an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem&quot;. The Palestinian Arabs and members of the Arab League had rejected any partition of Palestine.

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly passed Resolution 181 (commonly known as the UN Partition Plan for Palestine) which recommended the adoption and implementation of a slightly modified version of the UNSCOP majority Partition Plan, by 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions, achieving the required two-thirds majority. The resolution was rejected by the Palestinian Arabs; and all members of the Arab League voted against.

=== UN Mediator in Palestine ===
Within a few days of the passing of the Partition Plan (Resolution 181), full scale Jewish–Arab fighting broke out in Palestine. It also led to anti-Jewish violence in Arab countries, and to a Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. In an attempt to mediate the continuing Jewish–Arab fighting in Palestine, UN General Assembly by Resolution 186 of 14 May 1948 called for the appointment of &quot;United Nations Mediator in Palestine&quot;.

Also on 14 May 1948, the day on which the British Mandate of Palestine was to expire, Israel declared &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel&quot;. The territory of Israel was to be that of the Jewish State proposed in Resolution 181.
On the day after the British Mandate expired, on 15 May, five neighbouring Arab states invaded and rapidly occupied much of the Arab portion of the Partition Plan, and threatening to take the whole of Palestine. In the introduction to the cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the UN Secretary-General on 15 May 1948, the Arab League gave reasons for its &quot;intervention&quot;: &quot;On the occasion of the intervention of Arab States in Palestine to restore law and order and to prevent disturbances prevailing in Palestine from spreading into their territories and to check further bloodshed&quot;. The invasion changed the dynamic of the region, transforming a two-state plan into a war between Israel and the Arab world.

Folke Bernadotte was appointed Mediator on 20 May 1948. Bernadotte succeeded in achieving a truce by May–June 1948 during which the British evacuated Palestine. He proposed two alternate partition plans, the second calling for a reduction in the size of the Jewish State and loss of sovereignty over the harbour city of Haifa. Both were rejected. Lehi, a Zionist group, assassinated him and his aide, UN observer Colonel André Serot on 17 September 1948. Bernadotte was succeeded by Ralph Bunche, who was successful in bringing about the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.

=== Resolution 194 – Status of Jerusalem and refugees ===

On 11 December 1948, Resolution 194 reiterated the UN&#x27;s claim on Jerusalem and resolved in paragraph 11 &quot;that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date&quot;. This resolution, accepted immediately by Israel, is the foundation of the claim of a Palestinian right of return. The Arab states initially opposed this resolution, but within a few months, began to change their position, and became the strongest advocates of its refugee and territorial provisions.

Resolution 194 also called for the creation of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP), consisted of France, Turkey and the United States. UNCCP proposed the Lausanne Conference of 1949. The conference lasted five months and was unsuccessful. After the failure of the conference, the UNCCP continued for some more years, but did not achieve any significant success. But the conference was noteworthy as the first proposal by Israel to establish the 1949 armistice line between the Israeli and Arab armies, the so-called green line, as the border of the Jewish state. This line has acquired an after-the-fact international sanction.

Following the failure at Lausanne to settle the problem of Palestinian refugees, UNRWA was created by resolution 302 (IV) of December 1949 to provide humanitarian aid to this group.

The UNCCP published its report in October 1950. It is noteworthy as the source of the official number of Palestinian Arab refugees (711,000). It again reiterated the demands for UN control over Jerusalem and for the return of Palestinian refugees.

=== Membership of United Nations ===
On the declaration of independence, a Provisional government of Israel was established; and while military operations were still in progress, the Provisional government was promptly recognised by the United States as the &quot;de facto&quot; authority of Israel, followed by Iran (which had voted against the UN partition plan), Guatemala, Iceland, Nicaragua, Romania, and Uruguay. The Soviet Union was the first country to recognise Israel &quot;de jure&quot; on 17 May 1948, followed by Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Ireland, and South Africa. The United States extended &quot;de jure&quot; recognition after the first Israeli election, on 31 January 1949.

On 15 May 1948, one day after the declaration of its establishment, Israel applied for membership of the United Nations, but the application was not acted on by the Security Council. Israel&#x27;s second application was rejected by the Security Council on 17 December 1948 by a 5 to 1 vote, with 5 abstentions. Seven votes in favor were required in order to approve the application. Syria was the sole negative vote; the U.S., Argentina, Colombia, the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted in favor; and Belgium, Britain, Canada, China and France abstained.
Israel&#x27;s application was renewed in 1949 after the Israeli elections. The Security Council by UN Security Council Resolution 69 on 4 March 1949 voted 9 to 1 in favour of membership, with Egypt voting no and Great Britain abstaining. Those voting in favour were: China (ROC), France, United States, Soviet Union, Argentina, Canada, Cuba, Norway, and Ukrainian SSR. Great Britain said it had decided to abstain because it believed Israel did not agree with United Nations&#x27; principles, citing Israel&#x27;s refusal to allow Jerusalem to be internationally governed in accordance with the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.

Admission to Israel&#x27;s membership was conditional on Israel&#x27;s acceptance and implementation of Resolutions 181 (the Partition Plan) and 194 (besides other things, on status of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees). On 11 May 1949, the General Assembly by the requisite two-thirds majority approved the application to admit Israel to the UN by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273. The vote in the General Assembly was 37 to 12, with 9 abstentions. Those that voted for were: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Byelorussia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Ukraine, South Africa, Soviet Union, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. Those that voted against were six of the then seven members of the Arab League (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen) as well as Afghanistan, Burma, Ethiopia, India, Iran and Pakistan. Those abstaining were: Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, El Salvador, Greece, Siam, Sweden, Turkey and United Kingdom. Many of the countries that voted in favour or had abstained had already recognised Israel before the UN vote, at least on a &quot;de facto&quot; basis.

=== 1950s ===

David Ben-Gurion, the Israeli prime minister at the time, supported sending Israeli troops to join UN forces in Korea. However, the political party Mapam was opposed to such measures as it favoured relations with North Korea over the South. As a compromise, instead of sending troops, the government sent $100,000 in medical and food supplies to the South Korean government.

After the failure of early attempts at resolution, and until 1967, discussion of Israel and Palestine was not as prominent at the UN. Exceptions included border incidents like the Qibya massacre, the passage of Security Council Resolution 95 supporting Israel&#x27;s position over Egypt&#x27;s on usage of the Suez Canal, and most prominently the 1956 Suez Crisis.

Following the closing of the Suez canal by Egypt, Israel, France and Great Britain attacked Egypt starting 29 October 1956. The First emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly was called on 1 November to address that crisis. On 2 November, the General Assembly adopted the United States&#x27; proposal for Resolution 997 (ES-I); it called for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of all forces behind the 1949 armistice lines and the reopening of the Suez Canal. The emergency special session consequently adopted a series of enabling resolutions which established the UNEF, the first UN peacekeeping force. On 7 November, David Ben-Gurion declared victory against Egypt, renounced the 1949 armistice agreement with Egypt and added that Israel would never agree to the stationing of UN forces on its territory or in any area it occupied. Eventually, Israel withdrew from the Sinai but with conditions for sea access to Eilat and a UNEF presence on Egyptian soil. By 24 April 1957, the canal was fully reopened to shipping.

=== 1960s ===

In 1961, the regional groups were created at the UN. From the onset, Arab and Muslim countries blocked the inclusion of Israel in the Asia group (see Regional Groups below).

After months of debate in the Security Council and General Assembly before, during and after the 1967 Six-Day War, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 was adopted. It became a universally accepted basis for Arab–Israeli and later, Israeli–Palestinian peace negotiations. In it, the Land for peace principle was spelled out. This resolution is one of the most discussed, both within and outside of the UN.

In November 1967, Gunnar Jarring was appointed as the UN special envoy for the Middle East peace process. The Jarring Mission was unsuccessful.

The Six-Day War of 1967 generated a new wave of Palestinian refugees who were not covered by the original UNRWA definition. From 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted an annual resolution allowing the 1967 refugees within the UNRWA mandate.

In 1968, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People was created to investigate Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories, and other matters. It has continued to generate yearly General Assembly resolutions and other documents.

=== 1970s ===

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict gained prominence following the emergence of Palestinian armed groups, especially the Palestine Liberation Organization and the increased political strength of the Arab group as the main suppliers of petroleum to the Western world. At the UN, the Arab group also gained the support of the Soviet Bloc against Israel allied to the US.

In rapid succession, several events brought the Palestinian struggle to the forefront: the 1972 Olympic Munich massacre, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the ensuing 1973 oil crisis and, in 1975, the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War.

The Geneva Conference of 1973 was an attempt to negotiate a solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict. No comprehensive agreement was reached, and attempts in later years to revive the Conference failed.

In 1973, a General Assembly resolution about Apartheid &quot;Condemns in particular the unholy alliance between Portuguese colonialism, Apartheid and Zionism.&quot; This statement was reused in the preamble to resolution 3379.

About the 1974 UNESCO decision to exclude Israel from its membership, Julian Huxley, the first director of UNESCO, wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; to complain. UNESCO defended this decision with two statements in 1974 and 1975. Israel&#x27;s membership was renewed two years later.

Starting in 1974, 1967 territories were named &quot;Occupied Arab Territories&quot; in UN documents. In 1982, the phrase &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territories&quot; became the usual name. This phrase was not used at the UN prior to 1967, when the same territories were under military occupation by Jordan and Egypt.

The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People was created in 1975 and of the United Nations Division for Palestinian Rights in 1977. Also in 1977, the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People was first celebrated on 29 November the anniversary of resolution 181.

The 1975 UN Resolution 3379 stated &quot;that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination&quot;. The resolution was preceded by resolutions adopted at the United Nations-sponsored World Conference of the International Women&#x27;s Year in 1975. Resolution 3379 was sponsored by 25 Arab states; 72 voted for, 35 voted against and 32 abstained.

In his speech to the UN General Assembly after the resolution&#x27;s passage, US ambassador to the UN Daniel Patrick Moynihan, declared that the US &quot;does not acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in this infamous act.&quot; Israeli ambassador Chaim Herzog told his fellow delegates this resolution was &quot;based on hatred, falsehood and arrogance. Hitler,&quot; he declared, &quot;would have felt at home listening to the UN debate on the measure.&quot;

The 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty was a landmark event. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat is credited for initiating the process, following the failure of the UN-mediated peace negotiations, notably the Geneva Conference. The secret negotiations at Camp David in 1978 between Sadat, Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter, and the treaty itself essentially bypassed UN-approved channels. The Camp David Accords (but not the Treaty itself) touch on the issue of Palestinian statehood. Egypt, Israel, and Jordan were to agree a way to establish elected self-governing authority in the West Bank and Gaza. Egypt and Israel were to find means to resolve the refugee problem.

The General Assembly was critical of the accords. General Assembly Resolution 34/65 (1979) condemned &quot;partial agreements and separate treaties&quot;. It said that the Camp David accords had &quot;no validity insofar as they purport to determine the future of the Palestinian people and of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967&quot;. In protest, the General Assembly did not renew the peace-keeping force in the Sinai peninsula, the UNEF II, despite requests by the US, Egypt and Israel, as stipulated in the treaty. To honor the treaty despite the UN&#x27;s refusal, the Multinational Force and Observers was created, which has always operated independently of the UN. Egypt was expelled from the Arab League for a period of ten years.

=== 1980s ===

Between 1980 and 1988, some states made attempts to expel Israel from the General Assembly. For example, the credentials committee received in 1985 a letter signed by 34 Muslim states and the USSR. These attempts were unsuccessful.

The Palestinian National Council adopted in Algiers in 1988 the declaration of independence of the State of Palestine. The UN has not officially recognised this state but, by renaming the PLO observer as the Palestine observer, can be seen as having done so unofficially. In July 1998, the General Assembly adopted resolution 52/250 conferring upon Palestine additional rights and privileges, including the right to participate in the general debate held at the start of each session of the General Assembly, the right of reply, the right to co-sponsor resolutions and the right to raise points of order on Palestinian and Middle East issues.

=== 1990s ===

Following sixteen years of intense diplomatic pressure by the US, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which determined that &quot;Zionism is a form of racism&quot;, of 1975 was revoked in 1991 by resolution 46/86 as a precondition for the participation of Israel to the Madrid Conference.

Following the 1993 Oslo peace accords between Israel and the PLO, followed in 1994 by the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, the language of yearly General Assembly resolutions was modified to reduce criticism of Israeli actions. Moreover, between 1993 and 1995 the Security Council never directly condemned Israel. During this period, the Security Council also denounced terrorism against Israel for the first time. The most central resolution adopted during this warming trend toward Israel came on 14 December 1993, when 155 member states endorsed the Israel–Palestinian and the Israel–Jordan agreements and granted &quot;full support for the achievements of the peace process so far&quot;. This resolution was the first UN call for Middle East peace that did not criticize Israel. In October 1993, for the first time since 1981, the Arab members of the UN did not challenge Israel&#x27;s seat at the General Assembly.

=== 2000s ===

The year 2000 saw the failure of the Camp David peace negotiations and the beginning of the Second Intifada.

In 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier became another subject of criticism. It was declared illegal by both the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice. The Court found that the portions of the wall beyond the Green Line and the associated regime that had been imposed on the Palestinian inhabitants is illegal. The Court cited illegal interference by the government of Israel with the Palestinian&#x27;s national right to self-determination; and land confiscations, house demolitions, the creation of enclaves, and restrictions on movement and access to water, food, education, health care, work, and an adequate standard of living in violation of Israel&#x27;s obligations under international law. The UN Fact Finding Mission and several UN Rapporteurs subsequently noted that in the movement and access policy there has been a violation of the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin.

A series of terrorist attacks in March 2002 prompted Israel to conduct Operation Defensive Shield. The fiercest episode was the battle of Jenin in the UNRWA administered refugee camp of Jenin, where 75 died (23 IDF soldiers, 38 armed and 14 unarmed Palestinians) and 10% of the camp&#x27;s buildings destroyed. The UN send a first visiting mission. A separate fact-finding mission was mandated by the Security Council but blocked by Israel, a move condemned in General Assembly resolution 10/10 (May 2002). This mission was replaced by a report which was widely commented in the media. Many observers noted that the UN dropped the accusations of massacre made by Palestinians during and soon after the battle, and reproduced in the annex 1 of the report.

The Road map for peace is, since 2002, the latest and current effort by the UN to negotiate peace in the region. This document was initially proposed by US president George W. Bush and sponsored by a quartet of the US, Russia, the European Union and the UN. The official text is in the form of a letter to the Security Council, not a General Assembly or Security Council resolution. It generated a series of changes: the sidelining of Yasser Arafat and the unilateral withdrawal of Jewish settlers and the Israeli forces from occupied territories, notably the Gaza strip. Progress is now stalled.

In 2003, Israel sought to gain support for a resolution of its own, the first it had introduced since 1976. The resolution called for the protection of Israeli children from terrorism. The resolution was worded to be very similar to General Assembly resolution 58/155 (22 December 2003) titled &quot; Situation of and assistance to Palestinian children&quot;. Israel withdrew the draft after a group of nations belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, led by Egypt, insisted on including amendments that would have transformed the document into an anti-Israel resolution. The changes demanded were the altering of all references to &quot;Israeli children&quot; to read &quot;Middle Eastern children,&quot; and the insertion of harsh condemnation of Israeli &quot;military assaults,&quot; &quot;occupation&quot; and &quot;excessive use of force&quot; before any mention of Arab terrorism. The draft was withdrawn and never came to vote.

Security Council Resolution 1544 (2004) reiterated the obligation of Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and called on Israel to address its security needs within the boundaries of international law.

In 2005, the UN approached Israel with a request that it contribute IDF troops, especially military medical units, to UN peacekeeping missions such as those in Haiti, Kosovo, Congo, and Liberia. The UN also expressed interest in purchasing Israeli-made military equipment for UN peacekeepers, especially night-vision goggles and telecommunications equipment.

The Israeli representative was elected in 2005 to the symbolic position of vice-president of the 60th UN General Assembly.

On 11 December 2007, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on agricultural technology for development sponsored by Israel. The Arab group proposed a series of amendments referring to the Palestinian occupied territories, but these amendments were rejected. The Tunisian representative said: &quot;The Arab Group was convinced that Israel was neither interested in agriculture nor the peace process.&quot; This group demanded a vote on the resolution, an unusual demand for this kind of country-neutral resolution. &quot;The representative of the United States (...) expressed disappointment with the request for a recorded vote because that could send a signal that there was no consensus on the issues at stake, which was not the case. The United States was saddened by the inappropriate injection into the agenda item of irrelevant political considerations, characterized by inflammatory remarks that devalued the importance of the United Nations agenda&quot;. The resolution was approved by a recorded vote of 118 in favour to none against, with 29 abstentions. The abstentions were mainly from the Arab Group, with the notable exception of Pakistan which voted in favour.

=== 2010s ===

In February 2011, the United States vetoed a draft resolution to condemn all Jewish settlements established in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 as illegal. The resolution, which was supported by all other Security Council members and co-sponsored by over 120 nations, would have demanded that &quot;Israel, as the occupying power, immediately and completely ceases all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem and that it fully respect its legal obligations in this regard.&quot; The U.S. representative, Susan E. Rice, said that while it agreed that the settlements were illegal, the resolution would harm chances for negotiations. Israel&#x27;s deputy Foreign Minister, Daniel Ayalon, said that the &quot;UN serves as a rubber stamp for the Arab countries and, as such, the General Assembly has an automatic majority,&quot; and that the vote &quot;proved that the United States is the only country capable of advancing the peace process and the only righteous one speaking the truth: that direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians are required.&quot; Palestinian negotiators, however, have refused to resume direct talks until Israel ceases all settlement activity.

On 31 January 2012, the United Nations independent &quot;International Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory&quot; filed a report stating that Israeli settlements led to a multitude of violations of Palestinian human rights and that if Israel did not stop all settlement activity immediately and begin withdrawing all settlers from the West Bank, it potentially might face a case at the International Criminal Court. It said that Israel was in violation of article 49 of the fourth Geneva convention forbidding transferring civilians of the occupying nation into occupied territory. It held that the settlements are &quot;leading to a creeping annexation that prevents the establishment of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state and undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.&quot; After Palestine&#x27;s admission to the United Nations as a non-member state in September 2012, it potentially may have its complaint heard by the International Court. Israel refused to co-operate with UNHRC investigators and its foreign ministry replied to the report saying that &quot;Counterproductive measures – such as the report before us – will only hamper efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Israel–Palestinian conflict. The human rights council has sadly distinguished itself by its systematically one-sided and biased approach towards Israel.&quot;

=== 2020s ===

In the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel and during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the Israeli government criticized the United Nations. On multiple occasions, Israeli officials called for the resignation of UN secretary-general António Guterres. Israel also moved to limit the issuance of travel visas to UN representatives. Lynn Hastings, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, was forced to leave Israel after her visa was revoked. The United Nations criticized Israel for bombing its facilities and killing 142 UN employees, while Israel stated the UN was biased. By 8 January 2024, the UN had recorded 63 direct hits by Israel on its facilities since 7 October. On 15 January, UNRWA reported its facilities had been affected by Israeli fighting on 232 incidents, with 150 UNRWA staff and 330 internally displaced people killed. By late-May 2024, the UN stated that 450 displaced people had been killed in UNRWA shelters since 7 October 2023.

In May 2024, the Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan shredded a copy of the United Nations charter and called the United Nations a &quot;terror organisation&quot;. In June 2024, a Knesset bill proposed designating UNRWA as a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;. The same month, the United Nations added Israel to a list of states committing violations against children. In response, the Israeli government discussed implementing punitive measures against UN agencies operating in the Palestinian Territories. Speaking to Israeli public radio, Erdan stated, &quot;The time has come for Israel to seriously consider the pros and cons of withdrawing from the United Nations.&quot; In July 2024, an Israeli air raid destroyed UNRWA&#x27;s headquarters in Gaza City, which the UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini stated was a &quot;blatant&quot; war crime. Several days later, the Knesset voted to designate UNRWA a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;. 

In October 2024, Israel voted to ban communication between the government and UNRWA, effectively making humanitarian aid border crossings into Gaza impossible. Officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry acknowledged that such a move could jeopardize Israel&#x27;s membership in the United Nations.

== Issues ==
=== Legality of the State of Israel ===

Resolution 181 laid a foundation within international law and diplomacy for the creation of the state of Israel; as it was the first formal recognition by an international body of the legitimacy of a Jewish state, to exist within a partition of the territory along with an Arab state.

The UN followed the practice of the Paris Peace Conference and the League of Nations regarding the creation of states. Religious and minority rights were placed under the protection of the United Nations and recognition of the new states was conditioned upon acceptance of a constitutional plan of legal protections. Israel acknowledged that obligation, and Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence stated that the State of Israel would ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. In the hearings before the Ad Hoc Political Committee that considered Israel&#x27;s application for membership in the United Nations, Abba Eban said that the rights stipulated in section C. Declaration, chapters 1 and 2 of UN resolution 181(II) had been constitutionally embodied as the fundamental law of the state of Israel as required by the resolution. The instruments that he cited were the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel, and various cables and letters of confirmation addressed to the Secretary General. Eban&#x27;s explanations and Israel&#x27;s undertakings were noted in the text of General Assembly Resolution 273 (III) Admission of Israel to membership in the United Nations, May 11, 1949.,

=== Allegations of bias ===

In recent years, the Middle East was the subject of 76% of country-specific General Assembly resolutions, 100% of the Human Rights Council resolutions, 100% of the Commission on the Status of Women resolutions, 50% of reports from the World Food Programme, 6% of United Nations Security Council resolutions and 6 of the 10 Emergency sessions.

These decisions often criticize Israel for its &quot;occupation of Palestinian land and its oppression of Palestinians.&quot; A number of observers have described this criticism as excessive. For example, according to the UN Association of the UK, General Assembly resolutions in the period 1990–2003 show bias against Israel, condemnation of violence against Palestinians, but only occasional discussion of violence against Israelis.

The United States has been criticized as well by the OIC and other Arab organisations, for vetoing most Security Council decisions critical of Israel, the so-called Negroponte doctrine. Since 1961, Israel has been barred from the Asian regional group. In 2000, it was offered limited membership in the Western European and Others Group. On 29 November 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 changing Palestine&#x27;s &quot;entity&quot; status to &quot;non-member state&quot; by a vote of 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions. Some sources claim that these measures implicitly recognised its sovereignty.

In 2002, the PLO issued a report comparing the international response to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to similar situations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Rwanda, East Timor, and Iraq. It contended that the international community, and the Security Council in particular, displayed pro-Israel bias because, in these other cases, &quot;the international community has both condemned violations of international law and has taken action to ensure that the violations cease. In the case of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict, however, while the same condemnations have been issued against Israel, absolutely no enforcement action has been taken.&quot;

A 2005 report by the United States Institute of Peace on UN reform said that, contrary to the UN Charter&#x27;s principle of equality of rights for all nations, Israel is denied rights enjoyed by all other member-states, and that a level of systematic hostility against it is routinely expressed, organized, and funded within the United Nations system.

In a lecture at the 2003 UN conference on antisemitism, Anne Bayefsky said:
There has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in China, or the more than a million female migrant workers in Saudi Arabia being kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in Zimbabwe. Every year, UN bodies are required to produce at least 25 reports on alleged human rights violations by Israel, but not one on an Iranian criminal justice system which mandates punishments like crucifixion, stoning, and cross-amputation. This is not legitimate critique of states with equal or worse human rights records. It is demonization of the Jewish state.

Legal scholar Robert A. Caplen wrote that institutional bias against Israel within the UN has deprived the country of its ability to exercise lawfully those rights accorded to member states under the UN Charter.

In October 2010, Canada lost to Portugal in a vote for a seat at the Security Council. Several observers attributed this loss to the pro-Israel policy of Canada at the UN, including Canadian PM Stephen Harper.

On 16 August 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated in a meeting with Israeli students that there was a biased attitude towards the Israeli people and Israeli government at the UN. He described this as &quot;an unfortunate situation.&quot; A few days later, Ban Ki-Moon retracted those comments, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is discrimination against Israel at the United Nations&quot;.

In an interview on 16 December 2016, UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, said that the UN has issued a &quot;disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel.&quot;

In July 2024, the UN Human Right Council&#x27;s Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese expressed support on X (formerly Twitter) for a post that compared Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. The post, uploaded by former UN human rights official Craig Mokhiber, featured an image of Hitler saluting in a crowd above a photo of Netanyahu addressing the US Congress. In response, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield stated, &quot;It is clear [Albanese] is not fit for this or any position at the UN.&quot; Responding to the criticism, Albanese said, &quot;The Memory of the #Holocaust remains intact and sacred thank[s] to people of conscience worldwide. Institutional rants and outburst[s] of selective moral outrage will not stop the course of #Justice, which is finally in motion.&quot; while Mokhiber said &quot;The world knows the truth. No one falls for this silly Israel lobby trick anymore. Israel is on trial for genocide in the ICJ. Netanyahu is charged by the ICC prosecutor with crimes against humanity, including extermination. &#x27;Never again&#x27; is for everybody. If that offends you, you are on the wrong side of history.&quot;

Following an Iranian missile attack on Israel on 1 October 2024, in which the country launched 180 ballistic missiles against Israel, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a general statement condemning the &quot;broadening of the Middle East conflict&quot;, without mentioning Iran. In response, Israel&#x27;s foreign minister, Israel Katz, announced that Guterres would be barred from entering the country due to his failure to condemn the Iranian attack. Katz wrote that &quot;Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran&#x27;s heinous attack on Israel, as almost every country in the world has done, does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil&quot;; as of 1 October, according to American Jewish Committee, 11 countries have condemned the Iranian attack.

=== General Assembly ===

A few countries have consistently supported Israel&#x27;s actions in the UN, such as the United States of America and the states of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau all of which are associated states of the U.S. Recently Australia, under the leadership of John Howard, and Canada, under the leadership of Stephen Harper, have also supported Israel at the UN. Many European countries usually adopt a neutral stance, abstaining from the ongoing condemnations of Israel and supporting the foundation of a Palestinian state. Such countries include France, Russia, and Germany.

A study published by the UN Association of the UK, reviewing the language of General Assembly resolutions about Israel between 1990 and 2003, found that:

resolutions adopted in the same period by the General Assembly were far more explicit in their condemnation of Israel. (...) Violence perpetrated against Israeli civilians, including the use of suicide bombers, is mentioned only a few times and then in only vague terms. Violence against Palestinian civilians, on the other hand, is described far more explicitly. Israeli occupying forces are condemned for the &quot;breaking of bones&quot; of Palestinians, the tear-gassing of girls&#x27; schools and the firing on hospitals in which a specific number of women were said to be giving birth. Another trend noted in General Assembly Resolutions is a progressively more anodyne tone towards Israel throughout the period examined. This is reflected in a decreasing tendency of resolutions to specify Israeli culpability in policies and practices reviewed by the General Assembly; compare, for example, General Assembly resolution 47/70 &quot;(1992)&quot; with 58/21 &quot;(2003)&quot;.

As noted above, this trend towards a more anodyne tone regarding Israel at the General Assembly followed the signature of the Oslo Accords in 1993. This UN–UK report concludes that &quot;criticism is not necessarily a product of bias, and it is not the intention here to suggest that UNGA and UNSC reproaches of Israel stem from prejudice. From the perspective of the UN, Israel has repeatedly flouted fundamental UN tenets and ignored important decisions.&quot;

The 61st session of the General Assembly (2006–2007) adopted 61 country-specific resolutions (see graph above). The Israeli delegation alleged:

21 of those resolutions focused on and unfairly criticized Israel. The resolutions are usually initiated by members of the Arab Group, and are adopted by a wide margin (&quot;Automatic Majority&quot;) in the General Assembly

US envoy Susan Rice said in August 2009 &quot;The assembly continues to single out Israel for criticism and let political theater distract from real deliberation.&quot;

Caroline Glick writes that &quot;Due to the UN&#x27;s unvarnished belligerence toward it, in recent years a consensus has formed in Israel that there is nothing to be gained from cooperating with this openly and dangerously hostile body&quot;.

Former Israeli ambassador Dore Gold wrote that &quot;The Palestinians understand that the automatic support they receive at the UN enables them to implement restrictions on Israel&#x27;s right of self-defense. For this reason, the Palestinians have never abandoned the use of one-sided resolutions at the UN General Assembly, even during the most optimistic times of the peace process.&quot;

In an opinion piece in the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Efraim Chalamish said that, in 2010, &quot;Israel and the United Nations have significantly improved their relationships over the past few months.(...) Nowadays, the government is promoting its legitimate membership status by enhanced participation in more balanced UN forums, such as the Economic and Social Council, while still presenting a hawkish approach towards hostile and one-sided forums, including the Human Rights Council in Geneva.&quot;

=== Regional Groups ===

The United Nations Regional Groups were created in 1961. From the onset, the majority of Arab countries within the Asia group blocked the entry of Israel in that group. Thus, for 39 years, Israel was one of the few countries without membership to a regional group and could not participate in most UN activities. On the other hand, Palestine was admitted as a full member of the Asia group on 2 April 1986.

In 2000, Israel was admitted to the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) but Israel&#x27;s membership is limited to activities at the UN&#x27;s New York City headquarters. Elsewhere, Israel is an observer, not a full member, in WEOG discussions and consultations. Therefore, Israel cannot participate in UN talks on human rights, racism and a number of other issues. The Human Rights Council meets in Geneva, UNESCO in Paris.

In December 2007, Israel was voted by WEOG to represent the grouping in consultations for two UN agencies: HABITAT, the UN Human Settlement Program, and UNEP, the UN Environment Program. Both these agencies are based in Nairobi.

=== Shebaa farms ===
The status of seven small villages collectively known as the Shebaa farms, located at the Lebanon-Syria border, is controversial. Some evidences support a Syrian territory, others a Lebanese territory.

The United Nations considers this territory as Syrian which has, since the 1967 Six-Day War, been occupied by Israel. Following the 1978 Israel-Lebanon war, the Security Council accepted the report of UN-mandated cartographers stating that &quot;as of 16 June 2000 Israel has withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 (1978)&quot; In accordance with this decision, the current map from UNIFIL shows this territory as Syrian.

Hezbollah is an armed Lebanese group originally formed to repel the 1982 Israeli occupation of South Lebanon. Since 2000, it continues to fight occupation of Lebanon by Israel, using the Shebaa farms as justification. Following the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, the UN accepted at the request of the Lebanese government to re-evaluate the ownership of this territory. This promise was included in the text of Security Council resolution 1701. In August 2008, the Lebanese govt adopted Hezbollah&#x27;s claim to the &quot;right of Lebanon&#x27;s people, the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories in the Shebaa Farms, Kfarshuba Hill and Ghajar&quot;.

A Lebanon Independent Border Assessment Team (LIBAT) was mandated by the UN but has not yet reported on this issue.

=== United States policy at the UN ===

The U.S. has vetoed over forty condemnatory Security Council resolutions against Israel; almost all U.S. vetoes cast since 1988 blocked resolutions against Israel, on the basis of their lack of condemnation of Palestinian terrorist groups, actions, and incitement. This policy, known as the Negroponte doctrine, has drawn both praise and criticism.

=== UN Human Rights Council ===
According to UN Watch, an NGO, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) had, as at August 2015, issued more condemnations of Israel than of all other member states combined.

At its Second Special Session in August 2006, the UNHRC voted to establish a Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations that Israel systematically targeted Lebanese civilians during the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict. The Commission noted that its report on the conflict would be incomplete without fully investigating both sides, but that &quot;the Commission is not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe [its charter] as equally authorizing the investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel&quot;.

The Special Rapporteur on the question of Palestine to the previous UNCHR, the current UNHRC and the General Assembly was, between 2001 and 2008, John Dugard. The mandate of the Rapporteur is to investigate human rights violations by Israel only, not by Palestinians. Dugard was replaced in 2008 with Richard Falk, who has compared Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians with the Nazis&#x27; treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. Like his predecessor, Falk&#x27;s mandate only covers Israel&#x27;s human rights record. Commenting on the end of Falk&#x27;s mandate in May 2014, US delegate Samantha Power cited Falk&#x27;s &quot;relentless anti-Israeli bias&quot; and &quot;his noxious and outrageous perpetuation of 9/11 conspiracy theories.&quot;

Miguel d&#x27;Escoto Brockmann, a former UNGA president, was elected to the UNHRC Advisory Committee in June 2010.

Many observers have made allegations of anti-Israel bias. The Economist wrote: &quot;In its fourth regular session, which ended in Geneva on March 30, [2007,] the 47-member council again failed to address many egregious human-rights abuses around the world. (...) Indeed, in its nine months of life, the council has criticised only one country for human-rights violations, passing in its latest session its ninth resolution against Israel.&quot; In 2007 Human Rights Watch noted the UNHRC disproportionate focus on Israel and accused it of failing to take action on other countries facing human rights crises. Similar accusations were voiced by Freedom House, the Washington Post, Kofi Annan, Ban Ki-moon, US president George W. Bush, and members of the European Parliament. The UNHRC President himself, Doru Costea, said in 2007 that the council should &quot;not place just one state under the magnifying glass&quot;.

In a report on UNHCR activities between June 2007 and June 2009, Freedom House found some improvement but noted that &quot;Israel remained the target of an inordinate number of both condemnatory resolutions and special sessions.&quot;

Esther Brimmer of the United States State Department said on 15 September 2010 &quot;we must remedy the [UNHR]Council&#x27;s ongoing biased and disproportionate focus on Israel.&quot; US Congress member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called for defunding of the HRC over its excessive criticism of Israel. The Daily News|location=New York denounces the apparent bias at UNHCR in two editorials. Current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, denied the accusations of anti-Israel bias at the UNHCR. Addressing UNHCR in February 2011, Hillary Clinton denounced its &quot;structural bias against Israel&quot;. In March 2012, the UNHRC was further criticised by the United States over its anti-Israel bias. It took particular exception to the council&#x27;s Agenda Item 7, under which at every session, Israel&#x27;s human rights record is debated. No other country has a dedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to the UNHRC, Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, said that the United States was deeply troubled by the &quot;Council&#x27;s biased and disproportionate focus on Israel.&quot; She said that the hypocrisy was further exposed in the UN Golan Heights resolution that was advocated &quot;by the Syrian regime at a time when it is murdering its own citizens&quot;. On 24 March 2014, US delegate to the UNHRC, Samantha Power, qualified the anti-Israel bias of this committee as &quot;beyond absurd&quot;.

In March 2012, UNHCR was criticised for facilitating an event featuring a Hamas politician. The Hamas parliamentarian had spoken at an NGO event in the UN Geneva building. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu castigated the UNHRC&#x27;s decision stating: &quot;He represents an organization that indiscriminately targets children and grown-ups, and women and men. Innocents – is their special favorite target.&quot; Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the UN, Ron Prosor, denounced the speech, stating that Hamas was an internationally recognized terrorist organization that targeted civilians. &quot;Inviting a Hamas terrorist to lecture to the world about human rights is like asking Charles Manson to run the murder investigation unit at the NYPD&quot;, he said.

==== Fact Finding mission on the 2008 Gaza War (Goldstone report) ====
A fact finding mission on human rights violations during the 2008 Gaza War between Israel and Hamas administration in Gaza was called by 12 January 2009, UNHRC, which limited the investigation to &quot;violations (...) by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip&quot; but, before any investigation, it already &quot;Strongly condemns the ongoing Israeli military operation carried out in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, which has resulted in massive violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people&quot;.

Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Ireland President Mary Robinson refused to head the mission because she &quot;felt strongly that the Council&#x27;s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground.&quot;

On 3 April 2009, Richard Goldstone was named head of the mission. In a 16 July interview, he said &quot;at first I was not prepared to accept the invitation to head the mission&quot;. &quot;It was essential,&quot; he continued, to expand the mandate to include &quot;the sustained rocket attack on civilians in southern Israel, as well as other facts.&quot; He set this expansion of the mandate as a condition for chairing the mission. The next day, he wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;I accepted because the mandate of the mission was to look at all parties: Israel; Hamas, which controls Gaza; and other armed Palestinian groups.&quot; The UNHRC press release announcing his nomination documents the changed focus of the mission. Writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, commentator Melanie Phillips said that the resolution that created the mandate allowed no such change and questioned the validity and political motivations of the new mandate.

Israel thought that the change of the mandate did not have much practical effect.

Israel refused to cooperate with the Goldstone Mission and denied its entry to Israel, while Hamas and Palestinian National Authority supported and assisted the Mission.

In January, months before the mission, Professor Christine Chinkin, one of the four mission members, signed a letter to the London &quot;Sunday Times,&quot; asserting that Israel&#x27;s actions &quot;amount to aggression, not self-defense&quot; and that &quot;the manner and scale of its operations in Gaza amount to an act of aggression and is contrary to international law&quot;. She authored the final report.

Israel concluded that &quot;it seemed clear beyond any doubt that the initiative was motivated by a political agenda and not concern for human rights&quot; and therefore refused to cooperate with it – in contrast to its policy to cooperate fully with most of the international inquiries into events in the Gaza Operation.

The mission report was published on 15 September 2009. As noted in the press release, the mission concluded &quot;that serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel in the context of its military operations in Gaza from 27 December 2008, to 18 January 2009, and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity. The Mission also found that Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, as well as possibly crimes against humanity.&quot;

Goldstone, however, explained that what he had headed was not an investigation, but a fact-finding mission. &quot;If this was a court of law, there would have been nothing proven&quot;, Goldstone said, emphasizing that his conclusion that war crimes had been committed was always intended as conditional. Nevertheless, the report itself is replete with bold and declarative legal conclusions seemingly at odds with the cautious and conditional explanations of its author.

Reactions to the report&#x27;s findings were varied. The report was not immediately ratified by a UNHRC resolution. This step was postponed to March 2010. This delay is attributed to diplomatic pressure from Western members of the council, including the US which joined in April 2009 and, surprisingly, from the Palestinian Authority representative.
About the U.S. pressure, UNHRC representative Harold Hongju Koh described the U.S. participation to the council as &quot;an experiment&quot; with the Goldstone report being the first test.

The report was finally ratified by 14 October UNHRC resolution A/HRC/S-12/L.1. Like the 12 January resolution but unlike the report, this ratification condemns Israel, not Hamas. The &quot;unbalanced focus&quot; of the ratification was criticized by U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly, U.S. ambassador to the UNHRC Douglas Griffiths and Richard Goldstone himself.

On 1 April 2011, Goldstone retracted his claim that it was Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, saying &quot;If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document&quot;. On 14 April 2011 the three other co-authors of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict of 2008–2009, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone&#x27;s recantation of this aspect of the report. They all agreed that the report was valid and that Israel and Hamas had failed to investigate alleged war crimes satisfactorily.

==== Commission of inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict ====

On 23 July 2014, during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, the UNHRC adopted resolution S-21 for a commission of inquiry to &quot;investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014&quot;. The apparent anti-Israel bias in the mandate of the commission was denounced by Gregory J. Wallance in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and by the US, Canadian and Australian delegates to the UNHRC during the debate of the resolution.

=== UNESCO ===

UNESCO also adopts yearly resolutions for the preservation of the old Jerusalem, a UNESCO World Heritage Site included in the List of World Heritage in Danger.

In 2007, an emergency session of UNESCO was held to discuss Israeli archaeological excavations at the Mughrabi ascent in the Old City of Jerusalem. The session report said that the excavations were &quot;a naked challenge by the Israeli occupation authorities&quot; to the UN position on the status of Jerusalem. Following a fact-finding mission, Israel was exonerated of blame by the executive board. UNESCO never criticized repeated episodes of mechanized excavations within the Temple Mount ground by the Muslim Waqf, and is financing a museum within the al-Aqsa Mosque compound (the Temple Mount). The museum closed for non-Muslims in 2000 and this situation has not changed until the time of this note, June 2014.

==== 2001 Durban conference against racism ====

During the World Conference against Racism held in Durban in 2001, the accusation that &quot;Zionism is a form of racism&quot; resurfaced.

In an editorial about the 2001 Durban&#x27;s World Conference against Racism, Ronald Eissens of &quot;I CARE&quot; (Internet Centre Anti Racism Europe) wrote &quot;All through the NGO Forum, there have been Antisemitic incidents. The Arab Lawyers Union had a stall in the NGO exhibition tents displaying gross Antisemitic cartoons. Copies of the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion were being sold. When the ISC was asked to do something against the Antisemitic cartoons they decided that the cartoons were not racist but &#x27;political&#x27;&quot;.

A similar scene was described by Anne Bayefsky The Qatar delegate said, according to official UN records:
the Israeli enmity towards the Palestinians, and its destruction of their properties and economy do not stem from its desire to subjugate them to the arrogance of power only, but also from its strong sense of superiority which relegates the Palestinians to an inferior position to them. Ironically enough, the Israeli security is sacred when balanced against the Palestinian security and all the Israeli heinous violations are justified as a means to bring back every Jew to a land that they raped from its legitimate owners and denied them their right to claim it back.

In a 2002 interview with the BBC, Mary Robinson said that some good came out of the conference, &quot;but I also admit that it was an extremely difficult conference. That there was horrible anti-Semitism present – particularly in some of the NGO discussions. A number people came to me and said they&#x27;ve never been so hurt or so harassed or been so blatantly faced with an anti-Semitism.&quot;

Navanethem Pillay, the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, published in 2008 a similar opinion of the event

==== 2009 Durban Review conference ====

The April 2009 Durban Review Conference held in Geneva, was boycotted by nine western countries. During an official speech at this conference, Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said:
some powerful countries (...) under the pretext of protecting the Jews they made a nation homeless with military expeditions and invasion. They transferred various groups of people from America, Europe and other countries to this land. They established a completely racist government in the occupied Palestinian territories. And in fact, under the pretext of making up for resulting from racism in Europe, they established the most aggressive, racist country in another territory, i.e. Palestine. The Security Council endorsed this usurper regime and for 60 years constantly defended it and let it commit any kind of crime.(...) The global Zionism is the complete symbol of racism, which with unreal reliance on religion has tried to misuse the religious beliefs of some unaware people and hide its ugly face.

During his speech, all European representatives walked out. The outcome document makes no reference to Israel or Palestinians.

=== Resolution 3379 ===
The 1975 Resolution 3379, which determined that &quot;Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination&quot; was revoked by Resolution 4686 in 1991. Twenty-five states voted against this revocation, twenty-one of which have predominantly Muslim inhabitants. During the first-ever conference on antisemitism at the UN, in 2004, Kofi Annan said that the UN record on antisemitism had sometimes fallen short of the institution&#x27;s ideals, and that he was glad that the &quot;especially unfortunate&quot; 1975 General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism had been rescinded.

The &quot;Zionism is a form of racism&quot; concept reappeared in 2001 World Conference against Racism in Durban. Zouheir Hamdan (Lebanon) claimed that &quot;One (Israeli) minister described the Palestinians as serpents, and said they reproduced like ants. Another minister proposed that Palestinians in Israel be marked with yellow cards&quot;. A draft resolution denounced the emergence of &quot;movements based on racism and discriminatory ideas, in particular the Zionist movement, which is based on racial superiority.&quot;. The draft was removed following the departure of the US and Canadian delegates. General Assembly President Father Miguel D&#x27;Escoto Brockmann repeated the accusation in a speech during the 2008 International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.

On 24 January 2008, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour welcomed the entry into force of the Arab Charter on Human Rights which states: &quot;Article 2(3) All forms of racism, Zionism and foreign occupation and domination constitute an impediment to human dignity and a major barrier to the exercise of the fundamental rights of peoples; all such practices must be condemned and efforts must be deployed for their elimination.&quot;

Arbour subsequently distanced herself from some aspects of the charter. The charter is listed in the web site of her office, among texts adopted by international groups aimed at promoting and consolidating democracy

=== Direct involvement of UN personnel in conflict ===
There have been occasional reports of UN personnel becoming caught up in hostilities.

Indian peacekeepers of the UNIFIL peace mission in Southern Lebanon were accused of complicity in the 2000 Hezbollah cross-border raid, in which three Israel Engineering Corps soldiers were killed and their bodies captured after Hezbollah fighters infiltrated into Israel. According to the Israeli newspaper &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot;, Hezbollah bribed several Indian troops with hundreds of thousands of dollars in return for participating in the kidnapping and secretly negotiated with them to make sure that they would participate. Israeli investigators who were sent to India to question the suspected soldiers were told that Hezbollah had paid them large sums of money for their cooperation.

On 22 November 2002, during a gun battle between the IDF and Islamic Jihad militants, Iain Hook, UNRWA project manager of the Jenin camp rehabilitation project, was killed by Israeli gunfire. A soldier had reportedly mistaken him for a militant and a cellphone in his hand for a gun or grenade.

On 11 May 2004, Israel said that a UN ambulance had been used by Palestinian militants for their getaway following a military engagement in Southern Gaza,

In 2004, Israel complained about comments made by Peter Hansen, head of UNRWA. Hansen had said that there were Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll, and that he did not see that as a crime, they were not necessarily militants, and had to follow UN rules on staying neutral.

On 26 July 2006, Israeli aircraft and artillery attacked a well-marked, long-standing UNIFIL position, killing four UNIFIL peacekeepers. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called the bombing &quot;deliberate&quot;, while Israel claimed that Hezbollah had fighters that fired from the vicinity of that position, and had sheltered near it to avoid an Israeli counterstrike.

In 2008, the Israeli Defense Ministry accused UNIFIL of intentionally concealing information to the Security Council about Hezbollah military activity south of the Litani river, in violation of its mandate.

In January 2009, during the Gaza War, a number of people were killed by Israeli bombing outside a school run by the UNRWA; the number and identity of victims is disputed (see Al-Fakhura school incident for details.) Initially, the UN accused Israel of directly bombing the school. Maxwell Gaylord, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for the Palestinian territories, described the incidents as tragic. Israel claims that a Hamas squad was firing mortar shells from the immediate vicinity of the school. Hamas denies this claim. In February 2009, Gaylord said that the UN &quot;would like to clarify that the shelling and all of the fatalities took place outside and not inside the school&quot;. The headquarters of the UNRWA in Gaza was also shelled on 15 January. Tons of food and fuel were destroyed. Israel claims that militants ran for safety inside the UN compound after firing on Israeli forces from outside. UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness dismissed the Israeli claims as &quot;baseless&quot;.

In March 2012, UN official Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood captioned the picture with &quot;Another child killed by #Israel... Another father carrying his child to a grave in #Gaza.&quot; It was later stated that the picture was published in 2006 and was of a Palestinian girl who had died in an accident unrelated to Israel. Israel&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor called for her dismissal, stating that she was &quot;directly engaged in spreading misinformation&quot;. He accused her conduct as deviating from &quot;the organization&#x27;s responsibility to remain impartial&quot; and said that such actions &quot;contribute to incitement, conflict and, ultimately, violence.&quot;

She later tweeted that she mistakenly had tweeted an old photo. Ma&#x27;an News Agency reported a week later that the hospital medical report on the dead girl read that she died &quot;due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza&quot;. There are differing accounts of how the Israeli air strike, reported to be as little as 100 meters away, may have caused the accident.

=== Cooperation with UN missions ===
In December 2008, Israel detained Richard Falk, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, and denied him transit to West Bank on his official mission.

On 30 August 2022, outgoing UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said &quot;In 2020, the 15 international staff of my Office in Palestine – which has been operating in the country for 26 years – had no choice but to leave. Subsequent requests for visas and visa renewals have gone unanswered for two years. During this time, I have tried to find a solution to this situation, but Israel continues to refuse to engage.&quot; She went on to say &quot;Israel&#x27;s treatment of our staff is part of a wider and worrying trend to block human rights access to the occupied Palestinian territory. This raises the question of what exactly the Israeli authorities are trying to hide.&quot; The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva accused her office of being a &quot;mouthpiece for Palestinian Authority.&quot;

<text>Myosins () are a family of motor proteins (though most often protein complexes) best known for their roles in muscle contraction and in a wide range of other motility processes in eukaryotes. They are ATP-dependent and responsible for actin-based motility.

The first myosin (M2) to be discovered was in 1864 by Wilhelm Kühne. Kühne had extracted a viscous protein from skeletal muscle that he held responsible for keeping the tension state in muscle. He called this protein &quot;myosin&quot;. The term has been extended to include a group of similar ATPases found in the cells of both striated muscle tissue and smooth muscle tissue.

Following the discovery in 1973 of enzymes with myosin-like function in &quot;Acanthamoeba castellanii&quot;, a global range of divergent myosin genes have been discovered throughout the realm of eukaryotes.

Although myosin was originally thought to be restricted to muscle cells (hence &quot;&quot;(s) + &quot;&quot;), there is no single &quot;myosin&quot;; rather it is a very large superfamily of genes whose protein products share the basic properties of actin binding, ATP hydrolysis (ATPase enzyme activity), and force transduction. Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain myosin isoforms. Some isoforms have specialized functions in certain cell types (such as muscle), while other isoforms are ubiquitous. The structure and function of myosin is globally conserved across species, to the extent that rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba.

== Structure and functions ==

===Domains===
Most myosin molecules are composed of a head, neck, and tail domain.
* The &quot;head domain&quot; binds the filamentous actin, and uses ATP hydrolysis to generate force and to &quot;walk&quot; along the filament towards the barbed (+) end (with the exception of myosin VI, which moves towards the pointed (-) end).
* the &quot;neck domain&quot; acts as a linker and as a lever arm for transducing force generated by the catalytic motor domain. The neck domain can also serve as a binding site for myosin &quot;light chains&quot; which are distinct proteins that form part of a macromolecular complex and generally have regulatory functions.
* The &quot;tail domain&quot; generally mediates interaction with cargo molecules and/or other myosin subunits. In some cases, the tail domain may play a role in regulating motor activity.

===Power stroke===
Multiple myosin II molecules generate force in skeletal muscle through a power stroke mechanism fuelled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis. The power stroke occurs at the release of phosphate from the myosin molecule after the ATP hydrolysis while myosin is tightly bound to actin. The effect of this release is a conformational change in the molecule that pulls against the actin. The release of the ADP molecule leads to the so-called rigor state of myosin. The binding of a new ATP molecule will release myosin from actin. ATP hydrolysis within the myosin will cause it to bind to actin again to repeat the cycle. The combined effect of the myriad power strokes causes the muscle to contract.

== Nomenclature, evolution, and the family tree ==
The wide variety of myosin genes found throughout the eukaryotic phyla were named according to different schemes as they were discovered. The nomenclature can therefore be somewhat confusing when attempting to compare the functions of myosin proteins within and between organisms.

Skeletal muscle myosin, the most conspicuous of the myosin superfamily due to its abundance in muscle fibers, was the first to be discovered. This protein makes up part of the sarcomere and forms macromolecular filaments composed of multiple myosin subunits. Similar filament-forming myosin proteins were found in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and nonmuscle cells. However, beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to discover new myosin genes in simple eukaryotes encoding proteins that acted as monomers and were therefore entitled Class I myosins. These new myosins were collectively termed &quot;unconventional myosins&quot; and have been found in many tissues other than muscle. These new superfamily members have been grouped according to phylogenetic relationships derived from a comparison of the amino acid sequences of their head domains, with each class being assigned a Roman numeral (see phylogenetic tree). The unconventional myosins also have divergent tail domains, suggesting unique functions. The now diverse array of myosins likely evolved from an ancestral (see picture).

Analysis of the amino acid sequences of different myosins shows great variability among the tail domains, but strong conservation of head domain sequences. Presumably this is so the myosins may interact, via their tails, with a large number of different cargoes, while the goal in each case – to move along actin filaments – remains the same and therefore requires the same machinery in the motor. For example, the human genome contains over 40 different myosin genes.

These differences in shape also determine the speed at which myosins can move along actin filaments. The hydrolysis of ATP and the subsequent release of the phosphate group causes the &quot;power stroke&quot;, in which the &quot;lever arm&quot; or &quot;neck&quot; region of the heavy chain is dragged forward. Since the power stroke always moves the lever arm by the same angle, the length of the lever arm determines the displacement of the cargo relative to the actin filament. A longer lever arm will cause the cargo to traverse a greater distance even though the lever arm undergoes the same angular displacement – just as a person with longer legs can move farther with each individual step. The velocity of a myosin motor depends upon the rate at which it passes through a complete kinetic cycle of ATP binding to the release of ADP.

===Myosin classes===

====Myosin I====
Myosin I, a ubiquitous cellular protein, functions as monomer and functions in vesicle transport. It has a step size of 10 nm and has been implicated as being responsible for the adaptation response of the stereocilia in the inner ear.

====Myosin II====
Myosin II (also known as conventional myosin) is the myosin type responsible for producing muscle contraction in muscle cells in most animal cell types. It is also found in non-muscle cells in contractile bundles called stress fibers.

* Myosin II contains two &quot;heavy chains&quot;, each about 2000 amino acids in length, which constitute the head and tail domains. Each of these heavy chains contains the N-terminal head domain, while the C-terminal tails take on a coiled-coil morphology, holding the two heavy chains together (imagine two snakes wrapped around each other, as in a caduceus). Thus, myosin II has two heads. The intermediate &quot;neck&quot; domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. In smooth muscle, a single gene (&quot;MYH11&quot;)) codes for the heavy chains myosin II, but splice variants of this gene result in four distinct isoforms.
* It also contains 4 myosin light chains (MLC), resulting in 2 per head, weighing 20 (MLC20) and 17 (MLC17) kDa. These bind the heavy chains in the &quot;neck&quot; region between the head and tail.
**The MLC20 is also known as the &quot;regulatory light chain&quot; and actively participates in muscle contraction.
**The MLC17 is also known as the &quot;essential light chain&quot;. Its exact function is unclear, but is believed to contribute to the structural stability of the myosin head along with MLC20. Two variants of MLC17 (MLC17a/b) exist as a result of alternative splicing at the MLC17 gene.

In muscle cells, the long coiled-coil tails of the individual myosin molecules can auto-inhibit active function in the 10S conformation or upon phosphorylation, change to the 6S conformation and join, forming the thick filaments of the sarcomere. The force-producing head domains stick out from the side of the thick filament, ready to walk along the adjacent actin-based thin filaments in response to the proper chemical signals and may be in either auto-inhibited or active conformation. The balance/transition between active and inactive states is subject to extensive chemical regulation.

====Myosin III====
Myosin III is a poorly understood member of the myosin family. It has been studied &quot;in vivo&quot; in the eyes of &quot;Drosophila&quot;, where it is thought to play a role in phototransduction. A human homologue gene for myosin III, MYO3A, has been uncovered through the Human Genome Project and is expressed in the retina and cochlea.
====Myosin IV====
Myosin IV has a single IQ motif and a tail that lacks any coiled-coil forming sequence. It has homology similar to the tail domains of Myosin VII and XV.

====Myosin V====
Myosin V is an unconventional myosin motor, which is processive as a dimer and has a step size of 36 nm. It translocates (walks) along actin filaments traveling towards the barbed end (+ end) of the filaments. Myosin V is involved in the transport of cargo (e.g. RNA, vesicles, organelles, mitochondria) from the center of the cell to the periphery, but has been furthermore shown to act like a dynamic tether, retaining vesicles and organelles in the actin-rich periphery of cells. A recent single molecule in vitro reconstitution study on assembling actin filaments suggests that Myosin V travels farther on newly assembling (ADP-Pi rich) F-actin, while processive runlengths are shorter on older (ADP-rich) F-actin.

The Myosin V motor head can be subdivided into the following functional regions:

* Nucleotide-binding site - These elements together coordinate di-valent metal cations (usually magnesium) and catalyze hydrolysis:
** Switch I - This contains a highly conserved SSR motif. Isomerizes in the presence of ATP.
** Switch II - This is the Kinase-GTPase version of the Walker B motif DxxG. Isomerizes in the presence of ATP.
** P-loop - This contains the Walker A motif GxxxxGK(S,T). This is the primary ATP binding site.

* Transducer - The seven β-strands that underpin the motor head&#x27;s structure.
* U50 and L50 - The Upper (U50) and Lower (L50) domains are each around 50kDa. Their spatial separation forms a cleft critical for binding to actin and some regulatory compounds.
* SH1 helix and Relay - These elements together provide an essential mechanism for coupling the enzymatic state of the motor domain to the powerstroke-producing region (converter domain, lever arm, and light chains).
* Converter - This converts a change of conformation in the motor head to an angular displacement of the lever arm (in most cases reinforced with light chains).

====Myosin VI====
Myosin VI is an unconventional myosin motor, which is primarily processive as a dimer, but also acts as a nonprocessive monomer. It walks along actin filaments, travelling towards the pointed end (- end) of the filaments. Myosin VI is thought to transport endocytic vesicles into the cell.

====Myosin VII====
Myosin VII is an unconventional myosin with two FERM domains in the tail region. It has an extended lever arm consisting of five calmodulin binding IQ motifs followed by a single alpha helix (SAH) Myosin VII is required for phagocytosis in &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, spermatogenesis in &quot;C. elegans&quot; and stereocilia formation in mice and zebrafish.

====Myosin VIII====
Myosin VIII is a plant-specific myosin linked to cell division; specifically, it is involved in regulating the flow of cytoplasm between cells and in the localization of vesicles to the phragmoplast.

====Myosin IX====
Myosin IX is a group of single-headed motor proteins. It was first shown to be minus-end directed, but a later study showed that it is plus-end directed. The movement mechanism for this myosin is poorly understood.

====Myosin X====
Myosin X is an unconventional myosin motor, which is functional as a dimer. The dimerization of myosin X is thought to be antiparallel. This behavior has not been observed in other myosins. In mammalian cells, the motor is found to localize to filopodia. Myosin X walks towards the barbed ends of filaments. Some research suggests it preferentially walks on bundles of actin, rather than single filaments. It is the first myosin motor found to exhibit this behavior.

====Myosin XI====
Myosin XI directs the movement of organelles such as plastids and mitochondria in plant cells. It is responsible for the light-directed movement of chloroplasts according to light intensity and the formation of stromules interconnecting different plastids. Myosin XI also plays a key role in polar root tip growth and is necessary for proper root hair elongation. A specific Myosin XI found in &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; was discovered to be the fastest known processive molecular motor, moving at 7μm/s in 35 nm steps along the actin filament.

====Myosin XII====

====Myosin XIII====

====Myosin XIV====
This myosin group has been found in the Apicomplexa phylum. The myosins localize to plasma membranes of the intracellular parasites and may then be involved in the cell invasion process.

This myosin is also found in the ciliated protozoan &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot;. Known functions include: transporting phagosomes to the nucleus and perturbing the developmentally regulated elimination of the macronucleus during conjugation.

====Myosin XV====
Myosin XV is necessary for the development of the actin core structure of the non-motile stereocilia located in the inner ear. It is thought to be functional as a monomer.

====Myosin XVI====

====Myosin XVII====

====Myosin XVIII====
MYO18A A gene on chromosome 17q11.2 that encodes actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity, which may be involved in maintaining stromal cell scaffolding required for maintaining intercellular contact.

====Myosin XIX====
Unconventional myosin XIX (Myo19) is a mitochondrial associated myosin motor.

==Paramyosin==
Paramyosin is a large, 93-115kDa muscle protein that has been described in a number of diverse invertebrate phyla. Invertebrate thick filaments are thought to be composed of an inner paramyosin core surrounded by myosin. The myosin interacts with actin, resulting in fibre contraction. Paramyosin is found in many different invertebrate species, for example, Brachiopoda, Sipunculidea, Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arachnida, and Insecta. Paramyosin is responsible for the &quot;catch&quot; mechanism that enables sustained contraction of muscles with very little energy expenditure, such that a clam can remain closed for extended periods.

Paramyosins can be found in seafood. A recent computational study showed that following human intestinal digestion, paramyosins of common octopus, Humboldt squid, Japanese abalone, Japanese scallop, Mediterranean mussel, Pacific oyster, sea cucumber, and Whiteleg shrimp could release short peptides that inhibit the enzymatic activities of angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase.

<text>Charles Hodge (December 27, 1797 – June 19, 1878) was a Reformed Presbyterian theologian and principal of Princeton Theological Seminary between 1851 and 1878.

He was a leading exponent of the Princeton Theology, an orthodox Calvinist theological tradition in America during the 19th century. He argued strongly for the authority of the Bible as the Word of God. Many of his ideas were adopted in the 20th century by Fundamentalists and Evangelicals.

== Biography ==
Charles Hodge&#x27;s father, Hugh, was the son of a Scotsman who emigrated from Northern Ireland early in the eighteenth century.

Hugh graduated from Princeton College in 1773 and served as a military surgeon in the Revolutionary War, after which he practiced medicine in Philadelphia.

He married well-born Bostonian orphan Mary Blanchard in 1790. The Hodge&#x27;s first three sons died in the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 and another yellow fever epidemic in 1795. Their first son to survive childhood, Hugh Lenox, was born in 1796. Hugh Lenox would become an authority in obstetrics, and he would remain especially close with Charles, often assisting him financially. Charles was born on December 27, 1797. His father died seven months later of complications from the yellow fever he had contracted in the epidemic of 1795. They were brought up by relatives, many of whom were wealthy and influential. Mary Hodge made sacrifices and took in boarders in order to put the boys through school. She, with the help of the family&#x27;s minister Ashbel Green, also provided the customary Presbyterian religious education using the Westminster Shorter Catechism. They moved to Somerville, New Jersey in 1810 in order to attend a classical academy, and again to Princeton in 1812 in order to enter Princeton College, a school originally organized to train Presbyterian ministers. As Charles prepared to enter the college, Princeton Theological Seminary was being established by the Presbyterian Church as a separate institution for training ministers in response to a perceived inadequacy in the training ministers were receiving at the university as well as the perception that the college was drifting from orthodoxy. Also in 1812, Ashbel Green, the Hodge&#x27;s old minister, became president of the college.

At Princeton, the first president of the new seminary, Archibald Alexander, took a special interest in Hodge, assisting him in Greek and taking him with him on itinerant preaching trips. Hodge would name his first son after Alexander. Hodge became close friends with future Episcopalian bishops John Johns and Charles McIlvaine, and future Princeton College president John Mclean. In 1815, during a time of intense religious fervor among the students encouraged by Green and Alexander, Hodge joined the local Presbyterian church and decided to enter the ministry. Shortly after completing his undergraduate studies he entered the seminary in 1816. The course of study was very rigorous, requiring students to recite scripture in the original languages and to use the dogmatics written in Latin in the 17th century by Reformed scholastic Francis Turretin as a theological textbook. Professors Alexander and Samuel Miller also inculcated an intense piety in their students.

Following graduation from Princeton Seminary in 1819, Hodge received additional instruction privately from Hebrew scholar Rev. Joseph Bates in Philadelphia. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Philadelphia in 1820, and he preached regularly as a missionary in vacant pulpits in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia, the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia, and Woodbury, New Jersey over the subsequent months. In 1820 he accepted a one-year appointment as assistant professor at Princeton Seminary to teach biblical languages. In October of that year he traveled throughout New England to speak with professors and ministers including Moses Stuart at Andover Seminary and Nathaniel W. Taylor at Yale Divinity School. In 1821 he was ordained a minister by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, and in 1822 he published his first pamphlet, which allowed Alexander to convince the General Assembly to appoint him full Professor of Oriental and Biblical Literature. Financially stable, Hodge married Sarah Bache, Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s great-granddaughter in the same year. In 1824, Hodge helped to found the Chi Phi Society along with Robert Baird and Archibald Alexander. He founded the quarterly &quot;Biblical Repertory&quot; in 1825 to translate the current scholarly literature on the Bible from Europe.

Hodge&#x27;s study of European scholarship led him to question the adequacy of his training. The seminary agreed to continue to pay him for two years while he traveled in Europe to &quot;round out&quot; his education. He supplied a substitute, John Nevin on his own expense. From 1826 to 1828 he traveled to Paris, where he studied French, Arabic, and Syriac; Halle, where he studied German with George Müller and made the acquaintance of August Tholuck; and Berlin where he attended the lectures of Silvestre de Sacy, Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, and August Neander. There he also became personally acquainted with Friedrich Schleiermacher, the leading modern theologian. He admired the deep scholarship he witnessed in Germany, but thought that the attention given to idealist philosophy clouded common sense, and led to speculative and subjective theology. Unlike other American theologians who spent time in Europe, Hodge&#x27;s experience did not cause any change in his commitment to the principles of the faith he had learned from childhood.
Starting in the 1830s Hodge suffered from an immobilizing pain in his leg, and was forced to conduct his classes from his study from 1833 to 1836. He continued to write articles for &quot;Biblical Repertory&quot;, now renamed the &quot;Princeton Review&quot;. During the 1830s he wrote a major commentary on Romans and a history of the Presbyterian church in America. He supported the Old School in the Old School–New School Controversy, which resulted in a split in 1837. In 1840 he became Professor of Didactic Theology, retaining, however, the department of New Testament exegesis, the duties of which he continued to discharge until his death. He was moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (Old School) in 1846. Hodge&#x27;s wife died in 1849, shortly followed by Samuel Miller and Archibald Alexander, leaving him the senior professor of the seminary. He was recognized as the leading proponent of the Princeton theology. On his death in 1878 he was recognized by both friends and opponents as one of the greatest polemicists of his time. Of his children who survived him, three were ministers; and two of these succeeded him in the faculty of Princeton Theological Seminary, C. W. Hodge, in the department of exegetical theology, and A. A. Hodge, in that of dogmatics. A grandson, C. W. Hodge, Jr., also taught for many years at Princeton Seminary.

== Literary and teaching activities ==
Hodge wrote many biblical and theological works. He began writing early in his theological career and continued publishing until his death. In 1835 he published his &quot;Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans&quot;. Although considered to be his greatest exegetical work, Hodge revised this commentary in 1864, in the midst of the American Civil War, and after a debate with James Henley Thornwell about state secession from the Union.

Other works followed at intervals of longer or shorter duration – &quot;Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States&quot; (1840); &quot;Way of Life&quot; (1841, republished in England, translated into other languages, and circulated to the extent of 35,000 copies in America); &quot;Commentary on Ephesians&quot; (1856); &quot;on First Corinthians&quot; (1857); &quot;on Second Corinthians&quot; (1859). His &quot;magnum opus&quot; is the &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; (1871–1873), of 3 volumes and extending to 2,260 pages. His last book, &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot; appeared in 1874. In addition, he contributed upward of 130 articles to the &quot;Princeton Review&quot;, many of which, besides exerting a powerful influence at the time of their publication, have since been gathered into volumes, and as Selection of &quot;Essays and Reviews from the Princeton Review&quot; (1857) and &quot;Discussions in Church Polity&quot; (ed. W. Durant, 1878) have taken a permanent place in theological literature.

This record of Hodge&#x27;s literary life is suggestive of the great influence that he exerted. 3,000 ministers of the Gospel passed under his instruction, and that to him was accorded the rare privilege, during the course of a long life, of achieving distinction as a teacher, exegete, preacher, controversialist, ecclesiastic, and systematic theologian. As a teacher he had few equals; and if he did not display popular gifts in the pulpit, he revealed homiletic powers of a high order in the &quot;conferences&quot; on Sabbath afternoons, where he spoke with his accustomed clearness and logical precision, but with great spontaneity and amazing tenderness and unction.

Hodge&#x27;s literary powers were seen at their best in his contributions to the &quot;Princeton Theological Review&quot;, many of which are acknowledged masterpieces of controversial writing. They cover a wide range of topics, from apologetic questions that concern common Christianity to questions of ecclesiastical administration, in which only Presbyterians have been supposed to take interest. But the questions in debate among American theologians during the period covered by Hodge&#x27;s life belonged, for the most part, to the departments of anthropology and soteriology; and it was upon these, accordingly, that his polemic powers were mainly applied.

All of the books that he authored have remained in print over a century after his death.

== Character and significance ==

Devotion to Christ was the salient characteristic of his experience, and it was the test by which he judged the experience of others. Hence, though a Presbyterian and a Calvinist, his sympathies went far beyond the boundaries of sect. He refused to entertain the narrow views of church polity which some of his brethren advocated. He repudiated the unhistorical position of those who denied the validity of Roman Catholic baptism.

He was conservative by nature, and his life was spent in defending the Reformed theology as set forth in the Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechisms. He was fond of saying that Princeton had never originated a new idea; but this meant no more than that Princeton was the advocate of historical Calvinism in opposition to the modified and provincial Calvinism of a later day. Hodge is classed among the great defenders of the faith, rather than among the great constructive minds of the Church. He had no ambition to be epoch-making by marking the era of a new departure. But he earned a higher title to fame in that he was the champion of his Church&#x27;s faith during a long and active life, her trusted leader in time of trial, and for more than half a century the most conspicuous teacher of her ministry. Hodges&#x27; understanding of the Christian faith and of historical Protestantism is given in his &quot;Systematic Theology.&quot;

== Views on controversial topics ==

=== Slavery ===
Hodge supported the institution of slavery in its most abstract sense, as having support from certain passages in the Bible. He held slaves himself, but he condemned their mistreatment, and made a distinction between slavery in the abstract and what he saw as the unjust Southern Slave Laws that deprived slaves of their right to educational instruction, to marital and parental rights, and that &quot;subject them to the insults and oppression of the whites.&quot; It was his opinion that the humanitarian reform of these laws would become the necessary prelude to the eventual end of slavery in the United States.

The Presbyterian General Assembly of 1818 had affirmed a similar position, that slavery within the United States, while not necessarily sinful, was a regrettable institution that ought to eventually be changed. Like the church, Hodge himself had sympathies with both the abolitionists in the North and the pro-slavery advocates in the South, and he used his considerable influence in an attempt to restore order and find common ground between the two factions, with the eventual hope of abolishing slavery altogether.

Hodge&#x27;s support of slavery was not an inevitable result of his belief in the inerrancy and the literal interpretation of the Bible. Other 19th century Christian contemporaries of Hodge, who also believed in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible, denounced the institution of slavery. John Williamson Nevin, a conservative, evangelical Reformed scholar and seminary professor, denounced slavery as &#x27;a vast moral evil.&#x27; Hodge and Nevin also famously clashed over polar-opposite views of the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

=== Old School ===

Hodge was a leader of the Old School faction of Presbyterians during the division of the Presbyterian Church (USA) in 1837. The issues involved conflicts over doctrine, religious practice, and slavery. Although prior to 1861 the Old School refrained from denouncing slavery, the issue was a matter of debate between Northern and Southern components of the denomination.

=== Civil War ===
Hodge could tolerate slavery but he could never tolerate treason of the sort he saw trying to break up the United States in 1861. Hodge was a strong nationalist and led the fight among Presbyterians to support the Union. In the January 1861 &quot;Princeton Review&quot;, Hodge laid out his case against secession, in the end calling it unconstitutional. James Henley Thornwell responded in the January 1861 &quot;Southern Presbyterian Review,&quot; holding that the election of 1860 had installed a new government, one which the South did not agree with, thus making secession lawful. Despite being a staunch Unionist politically, Hodge voted against the support for the &quot;Spring Resolutions&quot; of the 1861 General Assembly of the Old School Presbyterian Church, thinking it was not the business of the church to involve itself in political matters; because of the resolutions, the denomination then split North and South. When the General Assembly convened in Philadelphia in May 1861, one month after the Civil War began, the resolution stipulated pledging support for the federal government over objections based on concerns about the scope of church jurisdiction and disagreements about its interpretation of the Constitution. In December 1861, the Southern Old School Presbyterian churches severed ties with the denomination.

=== Darwinism ===
In 1874, Hodge published &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot;, claiming that Darwinism, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Both in the &quot;Review&quot; and in &quot;What is Darwinism?,&quot; (1874) Hodge attacked Darwinism. His views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. While he didn&#x27;t consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile, at Princeton University, a totally separate institution, President John Maclean also rejected Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. However, in 1868, upon Maclean&#x27;s retirement, James McCosh, a Scottish philosopher, became president. McCosh believed that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus argued that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge&#x27;s position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (Princeton University) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.

The debate between Hodge and McCosh exemplified an emerging conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin&#x27;s evolution theory. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion.

=== The nature of God ===
Charles Hodge was often critical of the traditional understanding of divine simplicity, instead teaching a more moderate form of simplicity. He argued that the views of simplicity taught by Augustine, Aquinas and Scotus &quot;destroy any true knowledge of God&quot;. Charles Hodge also rejected the traditional notion of divine impassibility, rejecting traditional notions that God&#x27;s love is not to be understood as a feeling.He however affirmed the doctrine of eternal generation, as taught by the Council of Nicaea.

<doc id="479394" wikidata="Q13217636" url="?curid=479394" title="Laura Miller (politician)">
<text>Laura Miller (born November 18, 1958) is an American journalist and politician who served as the 57th mayor of Dallas, Texas from 2002 through 2007. She decided not to run for re-election in 2007. She was the third woman to serve as mayor of Dallas.

==Early life==
Laura Miller was born in Baltimore, Maryland. She attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she graduated with a degree in political science and journalism in 1980.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Miller spent the early part of her career as a journalist working as a staff writer for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; and &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; and then as a columnist for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the now-defunct &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;. In 1991, Miller became an investigative reporter for the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; and then a columnist for &quot;D Magazine&quot;.

===Politics===
In 1998, Miller was elected to the Dallas City Council representing Oak Cliff and southwest Dallas. In 2002, Miller was elected as Mayor of Dallas, replacing Ron Kirk who left the post to run for the United States Senate position vacated by retiring Texas Senator Phil Gramm.

She fought for and won approval of a strengthened smoking ban, an ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, a revamped public housing system, a $23 million homeless assistance center, major changes to the city&#x27;s Trinity River Corridor improvement plan and a taxpayer-funded downtown redevelopment effort.

She participated in an agreement between American Airlines, the City of Fort Worth, DFW Airport and Southwest Airlines to revise the federal flight restrictions at Love Field Airport, which involved: replacing geographic limitations on Love Field service with: flight caps determined by a limitation on the number of gates allowed at Love Field, restrictions on the rights of any new air carrier to service North Texas via any airport other than DFW Airport, and banning international commercial air travel at Love Field. The unique agreement and resulting oligopoly required an exemption from federal antitrust laws, which Miller also successfully helped obtain.

David Levey, executive vice president for Forest City Enterprises, credited Miller for reviving a $250 million deal to renovate downtown&#x27;s long vacant Mercantile National Bank Building.

During her term, the Dallas Cowboys announced plans to build Cowboys Stadium and many citizens hoped it would be built in Dallas. The city and the Dallas Cowboys, however, failed to reach a deal and the stadium was built in Arlington.

She announced parade plans for the Dallas Mavericks championship in 2006, prior to the Mavericks losing four straight games and ultimately the NBA championship to the Miami Heat in six games.

Miller was succeeded in office by Republican Tom Leppert.

In May 2019. Miller made an unsuccessful run for Dallas City Council to represent District 13.

===Environmental efforts===
Laura Miller serves as Director of Projects, Texas, for Summit Power Group, a Seattle-based developer of wind, solar and gas-fired power plants. Summit was recently selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive a $350 million cost-sharing award to build the world’s first IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) clean-coal power plant located near Odessa, Texas. The low-emissions project, called the Texas Clean Energy Project, is projected to capture just under 3 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, which will be used for enhanced oil recovery in the West Texas Permian Basin.

Miller&#x27;s other environmental accomplishments included the formation and co-leading (with former Houston mayor Bill White) of the Texas Clean Air Cities Coalition, made up of 36 cities, counties and school districts in Texas that opposed the construction of 11 coal plants (which would have used older technology) by TXU, a Dallas-based energy company. Ultimately, TXU (now called Energy Future Holdings) officially suspended its plans to build eight of the eleven plants. As a result of these efforts, Miller won a 2008 Climate Protection Award from the Environmental Protection Agency for this nationally-recognized effort, which has been memorialized in a documentary film, produced and narrated by Robert Redford, and entitled &quot;Fighting Goliath: The Texas Coal Wars&quot;.

==Personal life==
Miller is married to Dallas attorney and former Texas State Representative Steven D. Wolens. They have three children.

In 1998, Miller was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments which effectively eradicated the cancer.

<text>Andrzej Pilipiuk (born 20 March 1974 in Warsaw), Polish humoristic science-fiction and fantasy author. He debuted in 1996 with short story &quot;Hiena&quot;, which featured the first appearance of Jakub Wędrowycz, an alcoholic exorcist. Since that time, Pilipiuk has written several dozen other short stories about that character.

Nine times nominated to the Janusz A. Zajdel Award, won it in 2002 for his short story &quot;Kuzynki&quot;, which he expanded into a novel in 2003 and followed by sequels: &quot;Księżniczka&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Dziedziczki&quot; in 2005. The series describes the adventures of 3 women: a more-than-1000-year-old teenage vampire, a 300-year-old alchemist-szlachcianka, and her relative, a former Polish secret agent from CBŚ (Polish &#x27;FBI&#x27;). A recurring character in the series alchemist Michał Sędziwój, and the universe is the same as the one of Wędrowycz (who makes appearances from time to time).

Plipiuk lives in Kraków.

<text>Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield (November 5, 1851 – February 16, 1921) was an American professor of Reformed theology at Princeton Seminary from 1887 to 1921. He served as the last principal of the Princeton Theological Seminary from 1886 to 1902. After the death of Warfield in office, Francis Landey Patton took over the functions of the office as the first president of seminary. Some conservative Presbyterians consider him to be the last of the great Princeton theologians before the split in 1929 that formed Westminster Theological Seminary and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

==Biography==
Warfield was born near Lexington, Kentucky on November 5, 1851. His parents were William Warfield and Mary Cabell Breckinridge, originally from Virginia and quite wealthy. His maternal grandfather was the Presbyterian preacher Robert Jefferson Breckinridge (1800–1871), the son of John Breckinridge, a former United States Senator and Attorney General. Warfield&#x27;s uncle was John C. Breckinridge, the fourteenth Vice President of the United States, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War. His brother, Ethelbert Dudley Warfield was a Presbyterian minister and college president. His fourth cousin twice removed was Wallis Warfield Simpson, whom Great Britain&#x27;s King Edward VIII abdicated his throne in order to marry.

===Education===
Like many children born into a wealthy family, Warfield&#x27;s childhood education was private. Warfield entered Princeton University in 1868 and graduated in 1871 with high honors. Although Warfield studied mathematics and science in college, while traveling in Europe he decided to study theology, surprising even many of his closest friends. He entered Princeton Seminary in 1873, in order to train for ministry as a Presbyterian minister. He graduated in 1876.

===Ministry===
For a short time in 1876 he preached in Presbyterian churches in Concord, Kentucky and Dayton, Ohio as a &quot;supply pastor&quot; — the latter church calling him to be their ordained minister (which he politely refused). In late 1876 Warfield and his new wife moved to Germany where he studied under Christoph Ernst Luthardt and Franz Delitzsch. Warfield was the assistant pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland for a short time. Then he became an instructor at Western Theological Seminary, which is now called Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. He was ordained on April 26, 1879.

In 1881 Warfield wrote a joint article with A. A. Hodge on the inspiration of the Bible. It drew attention because of its scholarly and forceful defense of the inerrancy of the Bible. In many of his writings, Warfield attempted to demonstrate that the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy was simply orthodox Christian teaching, and not merely a concept invented in the nineteenth century. His passion was to refute the liberal element within Presbyterianism and within Christianity at large. Throughout his life, he continued to write books and articles, which are still widely read today.

===Marriage===
In August 1876 Warfield married Annie Pierce Kinkead. Soon afterward they visited Germany as Warfield was studying at Leipzig. During their time there, the two were overcome by a fierce thunderstorm. The experience of the storm was so shattering that Kinkead never fully recovered and remained a functional invalid for the rest of her life. Warfield continued to care for her until her death in 1915, managing to fit his work as a theologian with his role as caregiver. They had no children.

===Princeton and death===

In 1887 Warfield was appointed to the Charles Hodge Chair at Princeton Theological Seminary, where he succeeded Hodge&#x27;s son A. A. Hodge. Warfield remained there until his death as the last conservative successor to Hodge to live prior to the re-organization of Princeton Seminary. Warfield is often regarded by Protestant scholarship as the last of the Princeton theologians.

He died in Princeton, New Jersey on February 16, 1921.

==Views==

===Bible===
During his tenure, his primary thrust (and that of the seminary) was an authoritative view of the Bible. This view was held in contrast to the emotionalism of the revival movements, the rationalism of higher criticism, and the heterodox teachings of various new religious movements that were emerging. The seminary held fast to the Reformed confessional tradition — that is, it faithfully followed the Westminster Confession of Faith.

Warfield believed that modernist theology was problematic, since it relied upon the thoughts of the Biblical interpreter rather than upon the divine author of Scripture. He therefore preached and believed the doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot; — that the Bible is God&#x27;s inspired word and is sufficient for the Christian to live his or her faith.

Much of Warfield&#x27;s work centered upon the Bible&#x27;s &quot;inspiration&quot; by God — that while the authors of the Bible were men, the ultimate author was God himself. The growing influence of modernist theology denied that the Bible was inspired, and alternative theories of the origin of the Christian faith were being explored.

After comparing grammatical and linguistic styles found within the Bible itself, modernist scholars suggested that because the human authors had clearly contributed to the writing of the biblical text, the Bible was written by people alone, not God. Warfield was a central figure in responding to this line of thinking by arguing that the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit did not lead to a form of &quot;mechanical&quot; inspiration (whereby the human authors merely wrote down what God dictated to them), but one in which the human author&#x27;s intellect was fully able to express itself linguistically, while at the same time being supervised by the Holy Spirit to ensure its inspiration. This approach is essential to understanding the view of inspiration held by many Reformed and Evangelical Christians today. &#x27;Verbal plenary inspiration&#x27; is the term that has come to describe this view.

===Studies in religious experience===
Warfield was a conservative critic of much religious revivalism that was popular in America at the time. He believed that the teachings and experience of this movement were too subjective and therefore too shallow for deep Christian faith. His book &quot;Counterfeit Miracles&quot; advocated cessationism over and against miracles after the time of the Apostles. Such attacks did not go unnoticed, and even today Warfield is criticized by proponents of revivalism in the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. For example, Jack Deere wrote &quot;Surprised by the Power of the Spirit&quot; with the intention of refuting &quot;Counterfeit Miracles&quot;. Warfield&#x27;s book was published before the worldwide spread of Pentecostalism and addressed the issue of claims to the possession of miraculous gifts under the headings, &quot;Patristic and Mediǣval Marvels&quot;, &quot;Roman Catholic Miracles&quot;, &quot;Irvingite Gifts&quot;, &quot;Faith-Healing&quot; and &quot;Mind-Cure&quot;.

===Calvinism===
Underpinning much of Warfield&#x27;s theology was his adherence to Calvinism as espoused by the Westminster Confession of Faith. It is sometimes forgotten that, in his battles against modernism on the one hand, and against revivalism on the other, he was simply expressing the Calvinist faith when applied to certain situations.

It was Warfield&#x27;s belief that the 16th century Reformers, as well as the 17th century Confessional writers, were merely summarizing the content and application of Scripture. New revelations, whether from the minds of celebrated scholars or popular revivalists, were therefore inconsistent with these confessional statements (and therefore inconsistent with Scripture). Throughout his ministry, Warfield contended that modern world events and thinking could never render such confessions obsolete. Such an attitude still prevails today in many Calvinist churches and Christians who embrace Calvinism.
===Evolution===

Warfield&#x27;s views on evolution have been a source of dispute. Scholars David N. Livingstone and Mark A. Noll highlighted Warfield&#x27;s statements on evolution to demonstrate his acceptance of the theory in their article &quot;A Biblical Inerrantist as Evolutionist&quot;. Theologian Fred G. Zaspel argues that these statements have led Livingstone and Noll to assume too much about Warfield&#x27;s views on the subject. Zaspel writes &quot;That Warfield actually committed himself to a doctrine of evolution seems impossible to affirm simply because although there are some indications that he entertained the idea, he never admits to accepting it.&quot;

Warfield studied and wrote about Charles Darwin&#x27;s religious views. In an article on Darwin&#x27;s religious life, he concluded that Darwin&#x27;s doctrine of evolution directly expelled Darwin&#x27;s Christian belief. Warfield writes, &quot;Thus the doctrine of evolution once heartily adopted by him (Darwin) gradually undermined his faith, until he cast off the whole Christianity as an unproven delusion.&quot; Warfield did not believe that evolution required such a rejection of faith. His 1889 review of &quot;The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin&quot; included this statement: &quot;There have been many evolutionists who have been and have remained theists and Christians.&quot;

In his 1915 article &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Doctrine of Creation&quot;, Warfield wrote &quot;It should scarcely be passed without remark that Calvin&#x27;s doctrine of creation is, if we have understood it aright, for all except the souls of men, an evolutionary one. The &#x27;indigested mass,&#x27; including the &#x27;promise and potency&#x27; of all that was yet to be, was called into being by the simple fiat of God. But all that has come into being since- except the souls of men alone – has arisen as a modification of this original world-stuff by means of the interaction of its intrinsic forces. Not these forces apart from God, of course…&quot; And further more he says, &quot;What concerns us here is that he [Calvin] ascribed the entire series of modifications by which the primal &#x27;indigested mass,&#x27; called &#x27;heaven and earth,&#x27; has passed into the form of the ordered world which we see, including the origination of all forms of life, vegetable and animal alike, inclusive doubtless of the bodily form of man, to the second causes as their proximate account. And this, we say, is a very pure evolutionary scheme.&quot;

Warfield also points out that, &quot;Calvin doubtless had no theory whatsoever of evolution; but he teaches a doctrine of evolution.&quot; In that same article, Warfield adds a significant footnote: &quot;H. Bavinck in the first of his Stone Lectures (&#x27;The Philosophy of Revelation,&#x27; 1909, pp. 9–10) remarks: &#x27;The idea of a development is not a production of modern times. It was already familiar to Greek philosophy. More particularly Aristotle raised it to the rank of the leading principle of his entire system by significant distinction between potentia and actus... This idea of development aroused no objection whatsoever in Christian theology and philosophy. On the contrary, it received extension and enrichment by being linked with the principle of theism.&#x27; Calvin accordingly very naturally thought along the lines of a theistic evolutionism.&quot;

In a separate reference:
===Church politics===
While he was certainly supportive of political moves within various churches to strengthen and push conservative theology, he was never interested in the actual process itself, preferring to use his work at Princeton to influence future generations of Presbyterian ministers.

=== Race ===
Warfield came from a family of emancipationists and was himself an outspoken opponent of racial segregation and racism at Princeton Seminary. This led to Warfield, when he was principal of the seminary, to allow a black student to live in white university halls, an action which was met by opposition from fellow faculty members. Warfield termed segregation a &quot;wicked caste system&quot; and wrote a number of theological treaties and essays to undermine the segregationist position.

== Influence and legacy ==
Along with Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, Warfield is acknowledged as one of the major influences on the thought of Cornelius Van Til. However, that influence was limited to certain areas. In apologetics, Warfield was a thoroughgoing evidentialist and the most prominent exponent of the Old Princeton school, whereas van Til, who was the most prominent figure in the Dutch wing of presuppositionalist apologetics, absolutely rejected the central tenets of Old Princeton evidentialism and protested violently against the evidentialism of his contemporary J. Oliver Buswell.

Warfield&#x27;s influence on contemporary evangelicalism can be seen in the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy.

<doc id="479409" wikidata="Q2121027" url="?curid=479409" title="Works Volume 2">
<text>Works Volume 2 is the sixth studio album by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, released on 25 November 1977. Unlike &quot;Works Volume 1&quot; (which consisted of three solo sides and one ensemble side), &quot;Works Volume 2&quot; was a single album compilation of leftover tracks from other album sessions, similar to the Who&#x27;s &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot; or Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Coda&quot;. While many derided the album for its apparent lack of focus, others praised it for showing a different side of the band than usual, with blues, bluegrass and jazz being very prominent as musical genres in this recording.

The remastered 2017 version of the album is expanded to a double-CD by the inclusion of the complete &quot;Works Live&quot;, an extended version of &quot;Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer in Concert&quot;.

==Songs==
&quot;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom...&quot;, &quot;Tiger in a Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; had been recorded at the 1973 sessions for the album &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; but did not appear on it. The funk-fusion tinged &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot; first appeared as the B-side to &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; had first surfaced as part of a 1973 BSS promotional flexi-disc before becoming the flip side to &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;, and &quot;Tiger in a Spotlight&quot; was briefly considered as a 1974 single but held over until this album. All three are heavily synth dominated while two also feature electric guitars, much in the style of the rest of &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;. 

Two solo singles released during the group&#x27;s sabbatical were also included. An orchestral version of Greg Lake&#x27;s &quot;I Believe in Father Christmas&quot; had been released at the close of 1975 and hit #2 in the UK, becoming an annual Christmas standard there. The version on this album replaced the orchestra with new synth parts from Emerson. Meanwhile, Keith Emerson&#x27;s cover of &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues&quot; had been released as a single in April 1976, reaching #21 on the UK singles chart. Its B-side, &quot;Barrelhouse Shakdown&quot;, was also included. 

The rest of the songs were outtakes from the 1976 sessions that produced &quot;Works Volume 1&quot;. &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was a faithful ragtime cover from Emerson, &quot;Watching Over You&quot; and &quot;So Far To Fall&quot; were guitar-based outtakes from Lake&#x27;s solo side, while &quot;Bullfrog&quot; and &quot;Close But Not Touching&quot; were jazz-fusion instrumentals originating from Palmer&#x27;s sessions. There is also a group cover of &quot;Show Me the Way to Go Home&quot; which closes the album. 

==Reception==
The album was not as commercially successful as the band&#x27;s previous albums; it reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 37 in the US. Three tracks from the album were released as singles: &quot;Tiger in a Spotlight&quot;, &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, and &quot;Watching Over You&quot;.

In a contemporary review, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; facetiously remarked that it is &quot;news&quot; when &quot;the world&#x27;s most overweening &#x27;progressive&#x27; group&quot; makes an album &quot;less pretentious than its title&quot;, but questioned whether it is &quot;rock and roll&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s David Ross Smith felt that it was &quot;highly underrated&quot; and wrote that the album&#x27;s &quot;brief pieces sustain interest; there really isn&#x27;t a weak tune in the set.&quot; Paul Stump, in his 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot;, commented that &quot;Even Progressive militants have trouble defending &quot;Vol. 2&quot;, although &#x27;When the Apple Blossoms Bloom in the Windmills of Your Mind&#x27; does have a perverse charm. &#x27;Tiger in a Spotlight&#x27;, however, a cheesy plod, shows just how low the band&#x27;s collective inspiration had sunk.&quot;

The two &quot;Works&quot; albums were supported by North American tours which lasted from May 1977 to February 1978, spanning over 120 dates. Some early concerts in 1977 were performed with a hand-picked orchestra and choir, but the idea was shelved after 18 shows with the band due to budget constraints. The final concert with the orchestra and choir took place on 26 August 1977 at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal that was attended by an estimated 78,000 people, the highest attended Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer concert as a solo act. According to Lake on the &quot;Beyond the Beginning&quot; DVD documentary, the band lost around $3 million on the tour. Lake and Palmer blame Emerson for the loss as the use of an orchestra on tour was his idea.

<doc id="479413" wikidata="Q14859627" url="?curid=479413" title="Vasodilation">
<text>Vasodilation, also known as vasorelaxation, is the widening of blood vessels. It results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls, in particular in the large veins, large arteries, and smaller arterioles. Blood vessel walls are composed of endothelial tissue and a basal membrane lining the lumen of the vessel, concentric smooth muscle layers on top of endothelial tissue, and an adventitia over the smooth muscle layers. Relaxation of the smooth muscle layer allows the blood vessel to dilate, as it is held in a semi-constricted state by sympathetic nervous system activity. Vasodilation is the opposite of vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels.

When blood vessels , the flow of blood is increased due to a decrease in vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. Vascular resistance is the amount of force circulating blood must overcome in order to allow perfusion of body tissues. Narrow vessels create more vascular resistance, while dilated vessels decrease vascular resistance. Vasodilation acts to increase cardiac output by decreasing afterload, −one of the four determinants of cardiac output.

By expanding available area for blood to circulate, vasodilation decreases blood pressure. The response may be intrinsic (due to local processes in the surrounding tissue) or extrinsic (due to hormones or the nervous system). In addition, the response may be localized to a specific organ (depending on the metabolic needs of a particular tissue, as during strenuous exercise), or it may be systemic (seen throughout the entire systemic circulation).

Endogenous substances and drugs that cause vasodilation are termed vasodilators. Many of these substances are neurotransmitters released by perivascular nerves of the autonomic nervous system Baroreceptors sense blood pressure and allow adaptation via the mechanisms of vasoconstriction or vasodilation to maintain homeostasis.

== Function ==
The primary function of vasodilation is to increase blood flow in the body to tissues that need it most. This is often in response to a localized need for oxygen but can occur when the tissue in question is not receiving enough glucose, lipids, or other nutrients. Vasodilation, both localized and systemic, also facilitates immune response. Localized tissues have multiple ways to increase blood flow, including releasing vasodilators, primarily adenosine, into the local interstitial fluid, which diffuses to capillary beds, provoking local vasodilation. Some physiologists have suggested that it is the lack of oxygen itself that causes capillary beds to vasodilate by the smooth muscle hypoxia of the vessels in the region. This latter hypothesis is posited due to the presence of precapillary sphincters in capillary beds. These approaches to the mechanism of vasodilation have not been found to be mutually exclusive.

=== Immune system ===
Vasodilation plays a major role in immune system function. Wider blood vessels allow more blood containing immune cells and proteins to reach the infection site. Vasodilation occurs as part of the process of inflammation, which is caused by several factors including presence of a pathogen, injury to tissues or blood vessels, and immune complexes. In severe cases, inflammation can lead to sepsis or distributive shock. Vasodilation is also a major component of anaphylaxis.

Inflammation causes not only vasodilation but also causes increased vascular permeability, allowing neutrophils, complement proteins, and antibodies to reach the site of infection or damage. Elevated vascular permeability can allow excess fluid to leave blood vessels and collect in tissues resulting in edema; vasodilation prevents blood vessels from constricting to adapt to reduced volume in the vessels, causing low blood pressure and septic shock.

In the case of inflammation, vasodilation is caused by cytokines. Interferon gamma, TNF-a, interleukin 1 beta, and interleukin 12 are a few examples of some inflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells such as natural killer cells, B cells, T cells, mast cells and macrophages. Anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate inflammation and help prevent negative results such as septic shock are also produced by these immune cells. Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability also allow immune effector cells to leave blood vessels and follow chemoattractants to the infection site via a process called leukocyte extravasation. Vasodilation allows the same volume of blood to move more slowly according to the flow rate equation Q = Av, where Q represents flow rate, A represents cross-sectional area, and v represents velocity. Immune effector cells can more easily attach to selectins expressed on endothelial cells when blood is flowing slowly, enabling these cells to exit the blood vessel via diapedesis.

Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction characterized by elevated vascular permeability, systemic vasodilation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction. Anaphylatoxins, specifically complement proteins C3a and C5a, bind to receptors on mast cells and basophils causing degranulation. Granules in these cells contain histamine, platelet-activating factor, and other compounds causing clinical manifestation of anaphylaxis- including systemic vasodilation causing dangerously low blood pressure. Immunoglobulin E, an antibody produced by plasma cells, also binds to receptors on mast cells and basophils causing degranulation.

== Mechanism ==

A basic understanding of cardiac output, vascular resistance, and blood pressure is necessary to understand the causes and impacts of vasodilation. Cardiac output is defined as the amount of blood pumped through the heart over 1 minute, in units of liters per minute, equal to heart rate multiplied by stroke volume. It is directly related to heart rate, myocardial contractility, and preload, and inversely related with afterload. Elevated vascular resistance due to constricted blood vessels causes in increase in afterload, the amount of force against which the heart must contract. Vasodilation therefore decreases vascular resistance, which decreases afterload, elevating cardiac output and allowing perfusion of tissues. Blood pressure measures how much pressure blood exerts on blood vessel walls; systolic blood pressure measures pressure while the heart contracts (systole), and diastolic blood pressure reflects pressure between contractions (diastole). Mean arterial pressure (MAP)is a weighted average of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and is a better measurement of perfusion over the duration of the cardiac cycle. Vasodilation works to decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure through relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media layer of large arteries and smaller arterioles. When vasodilation causes systolic blood pressure to fall below 90 mmHg, circulatory shock is observed.

Vascular resistance depends on several factors, including the length of the vessel, the viscosity of blood (determined by hematocrit) and the diameter of the blood vessel. The latter is the most important variable in determining resistance, with the vascular resistance changing by the fourth power of the radius. An increase in either of these physiological components (cardiac output or vascular resistance) causes a rise in MAP. Arterioles create the most vascular resistance of any blood vessel type, as they are very narrow and possess concentric layers of smooth muscle unlike venules and capillaries.

Vasodilation occurs in superficial blood vessels of warm-blooded animals when their ambient environment is hot; this process diverts the flow of heated blood to the skin of the animal, where heat can be more easily released to the environment. The opposite physiological process is vasoconstriction. These processes are naturally modulated by local paracrine agents from endothelial cells (e.g., nitric oxide, bradykinin, potassium ions, and adenosine), and by the autonomic nervous system and the adrenal glands, both of which secrete catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, respectively.

=== Smooth muscle physiology ===
The tunica media of the walls of arteries, arterioles, and veins is composed of smooth muscle and causes vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Contraction of smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction, and relaxation of smooth muscle causes vasodilation. Smooth muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system and is non-striated (does not contain sarcomeres). Contraction is dependent on concentrations of Ca2+ in the cytosol, either via Ca,Mg-ATPase from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or voltage-gated calcium channels from the extracellular matrix. Calcium ions bind with calmodulin, activating myosin light-chain kinase which phosphorylates the myosin light-chain. Phosphorylated light-chain myosin interacts with actin filaments forming a cross-bridge, allowing muscle contraction causing vasoconstriction. Vasodilation is caused by myosin-light-chain phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the myosin light chain causing muscle relaxation. Smooth muscle cells can remain contracted without use of ATP due to action of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light-chain phosphatase. Phosphorylation of this subunit by Rho-kinase prevents it from binding to and dephosphorylating the myosin light-chain, allowing the cell to remain contracted.

Vasodilation is the result of relaxation in smooth muscle surrounding the blood vessels. This relaxation, in turn, relies on removing the stimulus for contraction, which depends on intracellular calcium ion concentrations and is tightly linked with phosphorylation of the light chain of the contractile protein myosin. Thus, vasodilation works mainly either by lowering intracellular calcium concentration or by dephosphorylation (really substitution of ATP for ADP) of myosin. Dephosphorylation by myosin light-chain phosphatase and induction of calcium symporters and antiporters that pump calcium ions out of the intracellular compartment both contribute to smooth muscle cell relaxation and therefore vasodilation. This is accomplished through reuptake of ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via exchangers and expulsion across the plasma membrane. There are three main intracellular stimuli that can result in the vasodilation of blood vessels. The specific mechanisms to accomplish these effects vary from vasodilator to vasodilator.

PDE5 inhibitors and potassium channel openers can also have similar results.

Compounds that mediate the above mechanisms may be grouped as endogenous and exogenous.

== Causes ==

===Endogenous===
The vasodilating action of activation of beta-2 receptors (such as by adrenaline) appears to be endothelium-independent.

=== Autonomic nervous system control ===
As referenced in the explanation of smooth muscle physiology, smooth muscle within the tunica media is innervated by the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls essential involuntary body functions and originates as nerves leaving the brain stem or spinal cord; it contains both sensor and motor nerves. The two divisions of the ANS, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), impact blood vessels differently. Traditionally we understand that these two divisions work against each other, the SNS producing &quot;fight or flight&quot; and the PSNS producing &quot;rest and digest&quot;, but in the case of vascular innervation this line becomes blurred ANS nerves do not directly innervate the vasculature via synapses with muscle cells; instead, they release neurotransmitters that reach target cells and effect smooth muscle contraction or relaxation. Physical characteristics of the SNS and PSNS cause the SNS to have a prolonged, systemic impact on blood vessels, while the PSNS causes short-lived, localized change. SNS stimulation causes a base level of vasoconstriction often referred to as basal neural tone, maintaining blood pressure. Often vasodilation is simply the result of insufficient neurotransmitter to maintain basal neural tone, without the presence of a compound directly causing vasodilation.

Neurotransmitters can act by binding directly to smooth muscle cells or by binding to endothelial cells mediating the effects of the neurotransmitter. Below is a table summarizing major neurotransmitters involved in regulation of the vasculature.

Also worthy of mention when discussing neural control of vasodilation is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS. The kidneys retain water by reabsorbing sodium ions, or eliminate water by eliminating sodium ions. Sympathetic nervous system activity, reduced blood volume or reduced arterial pressure trigger β-adrenergic receptors in select kidney cells to release renin, which converts facilitates formation of angiotensin II from its substrate angiotensin. Angiotensin II triggers adrenal glands to secrete aldosterone, a potent vasoconstrictor.

Epinephrine, either exogenous or endogenous, is another vasoconstrictor released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It binds to α and β adrenergic receptors like norepinephrine, causing vasodilation and vasoconstriction in different body parts to redistribute circulation to critical areas.

=== Cold-induced ===

Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) occurs after cold exposure, possibly to reduce the risk of injury. It can take place in several locations in the human body but is observed most often in the extremities. The fingers are especially common because they are exposed most often.

When the fingers are exposed to cold, vasoconstriction occurs first to reduce heat loss, resulting in strong cooling of the fingers. Approximately five to ten minutes after the start of the cold exposure of the hand, the blood vessels in the finger tips will suddenly vasodilate. This is probably caused by a sudden decrease in the release of neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves to the muscular coat of the arteriovenous anastomoses due to local cold. The CIVD increases blood flow and subsequently the temperature of the fingers. This can be painful and is sometimes known as the &#x27;hot aches&#x27; which can be painful enough to bring on vomiting.

A new phase of vasoconstriction follows the vasodilation, after which the process repeats itself. This is called the Hunting reaction. Experiments have shown that three other vascular responses to immersion of the finger in cold water are possible: a continuous state of vasoconstriction; slow, steady, and continuous rewarming; and a proportional control form in which the blood vessel diameter remains constant after an initial phase of vasoconstriction. However, the vast majority of responses can be classified as the Hunting reaction.

== Treatment ==

=== Direct vasodilation drugs ===
These drugs can keep vessels staying opened or help vessels refrain from being narrowed.
* Angiotensin II receptor blockers
* ACE inhibitors
* Calcium channel blockers

=== Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonists ===
Drugs that appear to work by activating the α2A receptors in the brain thereby decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity.
* methyldopa

::According to American Heart Association, Alpha-methyldopa may cause Orthostatic syncope as it exerts a greater blood pressure lowering effect when one is standing upright which may lead to feeling weak or fainting if the blood pressure has been lowered too far. Methyldopa&#x27;s prominent side effects include drowsiness or sluggishness, dryness of the mouth, fever or anemia. Additionally to these, male patients may experience impotence.
* clonidine hydrochloride
* guanabenz acetate
* guanfacine hydrochloride

::Clonidine, guanabenz or guanfacine may give rise to severe dryness of the mouth, constipation or drowsiness. Abrupt cessation taking may raise blood pressure quickly to dangerously high levels.

=== Blood vessel muscle relaxants ===
Directly relax the muscle in the walls of the blood vessels (especially the arterioles), allowing the vessel to dilate (widen).
* hydralazine
* minoxidil

::Hydralazine may cause headaches, swelling around the eyes, heart palpitations or aches and pains in the joints. In clinical setting, hydralazine is not usually used alone.
::Minoxidil is a &quot;potent&quot; direct vasodilator used only in &quot;resistant&quot; severe high blood pressure or when kidney failure is present. Noted adverse effects comprise fluid retention (marked weight gain) and excessive hair growth.

== Therapeutic applications ==
Vasodilators are used to treat conditions such as hypertension, wherein the patient has an abnormally high blood pressure, as well as angina, congestive heart failure, and erectile dysfunction, and where maintaining a lower blood pressure reduces the patient&#x27;s risk of developing other cardiac problems.
Flushing may be a physiological response to vasodilators. Some phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, work to increase blood flow in the penis through vasodilation. They may also be used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
