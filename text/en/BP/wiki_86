<text>Dame Freya Madeline Stark (31 January 18939 May 1993) was a British-Italian explorer and travel writer. She wrote more than two dozen books on her travels in the Middle East and Afghanistan as well as several autobiographical works and essays. She was one of the first non-Arabs known to travel through the southern Arabian Desert in modern times.

==Early life and studies==

Stark was born on 31 January 1893 in Paris, where her parents were studying art. Her mother, Flora, was of English, French, German, and Polish descent. Her father, Robert, was an English painter from Devon. Stark spent much of her childhood in northern Italy, helped by the fact that Pen Browning, a friend of her father, had bought three houses in Asolo. Her maternal grandmother lived in Genoa.

The marriage of her parents was unhappy from the outset. They separated early in Stark&#x27;s childhood. Stark&#x27;s biographer, Jane Fletcher Geniesse—quoting Stark&#x27;s cousin, Nora Stanton Barney—claimed that Stark&#x27;s biological father was Obediah Dyer, &quot;a well-to-do young man from a prominent family in New Orleans&quot;. No corroboration of this account, even by Stark, is known; she did not make any reference to it in any of her writings, including her autobiography.

For her ninth birthday, Stark received a copy of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; and became fascinated with the Orient. She was often ill while young and confined to the house, so she found an outlet in reading. She delighted in reading French, in particular Alexandre Dumas. When she was thirteen, in an accident in a factory in Italy, her hair was caught in a machine, tearing her scalp and ripping her right ear off. She had to spend four months getting skin grafts in hospital, which left her face disfigured. She usually wore hats or bonnets, often flamboyant ones, to cover her scars.

At the age of 30, hoping to escape her life as a flower farmer in northern Italy, Stark chose to study languages at university. She chose to study Arabic and later, Persian. She studied at Bedford College, London and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).

==Early travels and writings==

During World War I, Stark trained as a VAD and served initially with G. M. Trevelyan&#x27;s British Red Cross ambulance unit, based at the Villa Trento near Udine. Her mother had remained in Italy and taken a share in a business; her sister Vera married the co-owner. In 1926, Vera died after a miscarriage. In her writings, Stark explained that Vera was not able to live life on her own terms, and she would not do the same. Shortly afterward, she began her travels.

In November 1927, she visited Asolo for the first time in years. Later that month she boarded a ship for Beirut, where her travels in the East began. She stayed first at the home of James Elroy Flecker in Lebanon, then in Baghdad, Iraq (then a British protectorate), where she met the British high commissioner. During that trip, she secretly travelled by donkey with a Druze guide and an English woman. She kept the journey secret as Syria and Lebanon were under French control as the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. This was a repressive government system that did not allow travel within the region. The group travelled by night and took remote, countryside routes. However, French Army officers still caught them, thought the women to be spies, but released them three days later. After her trip, Stark wrote about the repressive French regime and the abuse inflicted on the Syrian people in an English magazine.

By 1931, she had completed three dangerous treks into the wilderness of western Iran, parts where Westerners were unknown, and had located the long-fabled Valleys of the Assassins (Hashshashins). She described these explorations in &quot;The Valleys of the Assassins&quot; (1934). She received the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Back Award in 1933.

In 1934, Stark sailed down the Red Sea to Aden to begin a new adventure. She hoped to trace the frankincense route of the Hadhramaut, the hinterland of southern Arabia. Only a handful of Western explorers had ventured into the region but never so far or so widely as she. Her goal was to reach the ancient city of Shabwa, which was rumoured to have been the capital of the Queen of Sheba. She fell seriously ill on the trip. After contracting measles from a child in a harem, as well as dysentery, she had to be airlifted to a British hospital in Aden. Although she never reached Shabwa, she was able to travel extensively and recount many experiences. Stark returned to the region later for additional trips. During these journeys, she encountered slavery in Yemen, which caused a &quot;moral predicament&quot;, according to a New Yorker profile. Stark reasoned that slavery seemed to decline in less religious societies, and thus she felt that slavery would decline in Arabia as it evolved. She published her account of the region in three books, &quot;The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut&quot; (1936), &quot;Seen In The Hadhramaut&quot; (1938) and &quot;A Winter in Arabia&quot; (1940). For her travels and accounts, she received the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

==World War II==

In the autumn of 1939 Stark offered her services to the British Ministry of Information. Her prior experience in the Middle East was sufficient for the Ministry to send her to Yemen to spread propaganda on the British cause. Part of her duties involved showing films, despite the rulers of Yemen being strict Muslims who disapproved of any images of humans and wildlife. After working for two months in Yemen and Aden she was sent to Cairo, a posting that doubled her salary to £1,200. Following her arrival in June 1940 she set up an intimate salon where, over tea four times a week, she advocated for the British cause. Before long, Christopher Scaife who was teaching English at the King Fuad I University was sending her the odd Egyptian student who wanted to know what the British were fighting for. Stark encouraged them to bring their friends and the discussions expanded to cover not only the war but also its effects on Egypt. These discussions grew to become the basis of the &quot;Ikhwan al Hurriya&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood of Freedom&quot;) propaganda network that was aimed at persuading Arabs to support the Allies or at least remain neutral.
By the middle of the war, the brotherhood claimed to have tens of thousands of members. The work involved Stark travelling all over Egypt and often speaking for as many as 10 hours a day. These wartime experiences were described in her &quot;Letters from Syria&quot; (1942) and &quot;East is West&quot; (1945). Following a visit to Iraq during which she was besieged in the British Embassy during an attempted coup d&#x27;état in April 1941 Stark was asked by British Ambassador Sir Kinahan Cornwallis to set up a branch of the &quot;Ikhwan al Hurriya&quot; in that country. Stark agreed and spent the next two years in Iraq dispensing British propaganda.

In February 1943, she visited Archibald Wavell and his wife in India. To assist her with the return journey Wavell arranged for her to have a car. After driving it from Delhi to Teheran, she sold it, but officials in Cairo and Aden took a dim view of her taking upon herself to dispose of government property in wartime. Stark believed that since she had been given it she could sell it.

In 1943, Stark went on an official tour of British Mandate of Palestine. She gave speeches that called for quotas on Jewish migration to Palestine, which angered the global Jewish community. However, Stark felt that she was not at all anti-Jewish; she simply felt that Arab consent should be considered before mass migration took place. These speeches are thought to be her most controversial work during WWII. In 1943, she wrote &quot;I really can’t see that there is any kind of way of dealing with the Zionist question except by a massacre now and then... What can we do? It is the ruthless last penny that they squeeze out of you that does it... the world has chosen to massacre them at intervals, and whose fault is it?&quot;

==Post-war travel and writings==

Following her marriage in 1947, she published a volume of miscellaneous essays, &quot;Perseus in the Wind&quot; (1948) and three volumes of autobiography, &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Prelude&quot; (1950), &quot;Beyond Euphrates. Autobiography 1928–1933&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Coast of Incense. Autobiography 1933–1939&quot; (1953).

Following the failure of her marriage, Stark again began travelling, with her first extensive travels after the war being in Turkey, which was the basis of her books &quot;Ionia a Quest&quot; (1954), &quot;The Lycian Shore&quot; (1956), &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Path&quot; (1958), and &quot;Riding to the Tigris&quot; (1959). After this, she continued her memoirs with &quot;Dust in the Lion&#x27;s Paw. Autobiography 1939–1946&quot; (1961), and she published a history of &quot;Rome on the Euphrates: The Story of a Frontier&quot; (1966) and another collection of essays, &quot;The Zodiac Arch&quot; (1968).

The last expedition was to Afghanistan in 1968, when she was 75 years old. She travelled to visit the twelfth-century Minaret of Jam. In 1970, she published &quot;The Minaret of Djam: An Excursion into Afghanistan&quot;. In her retirement at Asolo, apart from a short survey, &quot;Turkey: A Sketch of Turkish History&quot; (1971), she busied herself by putting together a new collection of essays, &quot;A Peak in Darien&quot; (1976), and preparing selections of her &quot;Letters&quot; (8 volumes, 1974–82; one volume, &quot;Over the rim of the world: selected letters&quot;, 1982), and of her travel writings, &quot;The Journey&#x27;s Echo&quot; (1988).

== Photographic legacy ==

Stark, as well as being a writer, was a prolific and accomplished photographer. Some forty-plus of her albums, containing approximately 6,000 black-and-white prints, together with some 50,000 negatives are held as the Freya Stark Photograph Collection in the archive of the Middle East Centre, St Antony’s College, Oxford. Many of the photographs were taken with the same camera, a Leica III, which she bought in 1933 and used on her travels. The collection of photographs was published in its entirety in 1999, some having previously appeared in books such as &quot;A Traveller in Time: A Photographic Journey with Freya Stark&quot; by Malise Ruthven, 1986, &quot;Passionate Nomad: The Life of Freya Stark&quot; by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, 2001 and, of course, her own books, an example being &quot;Rivers of Time: Photographs by Freya Stark&quot; published in 1982.

Smaller collections of photographs by Stark are held at the Biblioteca Berenson, Villa I Tatti, Harvard University Centre for Italian Renaissance Studies Repository, in the Harry Ransom Centre, the University of Texas, at the Special Collections of the University of New South Wales, Canberra, and in the Conway Library whose archive, of primarily architectural images, is being digitised under the wider Courtauld Connects project.

In 1934, Stark was awarded the Royal Asiatic Society’s Richard Burton Memorial Medal in recognition of her contribution to geographic exploration and travel writing and a portrait of her resides in the society’s lecture room. The society holds 65 glass slides taken by Stark.

A photograph of Freya Stark by Robert Mapplethorpe, taken in 1975, was a gift of The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation to the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

==Later life==

She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1972 New Year&#x27;s Honours.

She died at Asolo on 9 May 1993, a few months after her hundredth birthday.

==Personal life==

In 1947, at the age of 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a British administrator, Arabist, and historian, whom she had met while working as his assistant in Aden early in World War II. Perowne was homosexual, which Stark did not know when they first married, although most of his friends did. Their marriage had many troubles, and Stark did not adjust well to being the wife of a civil servant. The couple had no children, separated in 1952, but did not divorce.

While revisiting Yemen in 1976, Stark suggested to the Secretary of the British Embassy with whom she was staying that she had never come close ‘to losing my virtue… including the nights I spent with Stewart.’ During that same trip, after decades without contact, Stark wrote to Perowne again, wishing him well. 

Perowne died in 1989.

<text>IS-54 and IS-136 are second-generation (2G) mobile phone systems, known as Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), and most often referred to as TDMA, are a further development of the North American 1G mobile system Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS). It was once prevalent throughout the Americas, particularly in the United States and Canada since the first commercial network was deployed in 1993. D-AMPS is considered end-of-life, and existing networks have mostly been replaced by GSM/GPRS or CDMA2000 technologies.

The name TDMA is based on the abbreviation for time-division multiple access, a common multiple access technique which is used in most 2G standards, including GSM, as well as in IS-54 and IS-136. D-AMPS competed against GSM and systems based on code-division multiple access (CDMA).

D-AMPS uses existing AMPS channels and allows for smooth transition between digital and analog systems in the same area. Capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 kHz channel pair into three time slots (hence &quot;time division&quot;) and digitally compressing the voice data, yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell. A digital system also made calls more secure in the beginning, as analogue scanners could not access digital signals. Calls were encrypted, using CMEA, which was later found to be weak.

IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification, including text messaging, circuit switched data (CSD), and an improved compression protocol. SMS and CSD were both available as part of the GSM protocol, and IS-136 implemented them in a nearly identical fashion.

Former large IS-136 networks, including AT&amp;T in the United States, and Rogers Wireless in Canada, have upgraded their existing IS-136 networks to GSM/GPRS. Rogers Wireless removed all 1900 MHz IS-136 in 2003, and has done the same with its 800 MHz spectrum as the equipment failed. Rogers deactivated its IS-136 network (along with AMPS) on May 31, 2007. AT&amp;T soon followed in February 2008, shutting down both TDMA and AMPS.

Alltel, who primarily used CDMA2000 technology but acquired a TDMA network from Western Wireless, shut down its TDMA and AMPS networks in September 2008. US Cellular, which now also primarily uses CDMA2000 technology, shut down its TDMA network in February 2009.

IS-54 is the first mobile communication system which had provision for security, and the first to employ TDMA technology.

==History==
The evolution of mobile communication began in three different geographic regions: North America, Europe and Japan. The standards used in these regions were quite independent of each other. 

The earliest mobile or wireless technologies implemented were wholly analogue, and are collectively known as 1st Generation (1G) technologies. In Japan, the 1G standards were: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the high capacity version of it (Hicap). The early systems used throughout Europe were not compatible to each other, meaning the later idea of a common &#x27;European Union&#x27; viewpoint/technological standard was absent at this time. 

The various 1G standards in use in Europe included C-Netz (in Germany and Austria), Comviq (in Sweden), Nordic Mobile Telephones/450 (NMT450) and NMT900 (both in Nordic countries), NMT-F (French version of NMT900), TMA-450 (Spanish version of NMT450), Radiocom 2000 (RC2000) (in France), TACS (Total Access Communication System) (in the United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland), and TMA-900 (Spanish version of TACS). North American standards were Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) and Narrow-band AMPS (N-AMPS).

Despite the Nordic countries&#x27; cooperation, European engineering efforts were divided among the various standards, and the Japanese standards did not get much attention. Developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s and first used commercially in the United States in 1983, AMPS operates in the 800 MHz band in the United States and is the most widely distributed analog cellular standard. (The 1900 MHz PCS band, established in 1994, is for digital operation only.) The success of AMPS kick-started the mobile age in the North America.

The market showed an increasing demand because it had higher capacity and mobility than the then-existing mobile communication standards were capable of handling. For example, the Bell Labs system in the 1970s could carry only 12 calls at a time throughout all of New York City. AMPS used Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) which enabled each cell site to transmit on different frequencies, allowing many cell sites to be built near each other.

AMPS also had many disadvantages, as well. Primarily, it did not have the ability to support the ever-increasing demand for mobile communication usage. Each cell site did not have much capacity for carrying higher numbers of calls. AMPS also had a poor security system which allowed people to steal a phone&#x27;s serial code to use for making illegal calls. All of these triggered the search for a more capable system.

The quest resulted in IS-54, the first American 2G standard. In March 1990, the North American cellular network incorporated the IS-54B standard, the first North American dual mode digital cellular standard. This standard won over Motorola&#x27;s Narrowband AMPS or N-AMPS, an analog scheme which increased capacity, by cutting down voice channels from 30 kHz to 10 kHz. IS-54, on the other hand, increased capacity by digital means using TDMA protocols. This method separates calls by time, placing parts of individual conversations on the same frequency, one after the next. TDMA tripled call capacity.

Using IS-54, a cellular carrier could convert any of its system&#x27;s analog voice channels to digital. A dual mode phone uses digital channels where available, and defaults to regular AMPS where they are not. IS-54 was backward compatible with analogue cellular and indeed co-existed on the same radio channels as AMPS. No analogue customers were left behind; they simply could not access IS-54&#x27;s new features. IS-54 also supported authentication, a help in preventing fraud.

==Technology specifications==
IS-54 employs the same 30 kHz channel spacing and frequency bands (824-849 and 869-894 MHz) as AMPS. Capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 kHz channel pair into three time slots and digitally compressing the voice data, yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell. A digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals.

The IS-54 standard specifies 84 control channels, 42 of which are shared with AMPS. To maintain compatibility with the existing AMPS cellular telephone system, the primary forward and reverse control channels in IS-54 cellular systems use the same signaling techniques and modulation scheme (binary FSK) as AMPS. An AMPS/IS-54 infrastructure can support use of either analog AMPS phones or D-AMPS phones.

The access method used for IS-54 is Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), which was the first U.S. digital standard to be developed. It was adopted by the TIA in 1992. TDMA subdivides each of the 30 kHz AMPS channels into three full-rate TDMA channels, each of which is capable of supporting a single voice call. Later, each of these full-rate channels was further sub-divided into two half-rate channels, each of which, with the necessary coding and compression, could also support a voice call. Thus, TDMA could provide three to six times the capacity of AMPS traffic channels. TDMA was initially defined by the IS-54 standard and is now specified in the IS-13x series of specifications of the EIA/TIA.

The channel transmission bit rate for digitally modulating the carrier is 48.6 kbit/s. Each frame has six time slots of 6.67-ms duration. Each time slot carries 324 bits of information, of which 260 bits are for the 13-kbit/s full-rate traffic data. The other 64 bits are overhead; 28 of these are for synchronization, and they contain a specific bit sequence known by all receivers to establish frame alignment. Also, as with GSM, the known sequence acts as a training pattern to initialize an adaptive equalizer.

The IS-54 system has different synchronization sequences for each of the six time slots making up the frame, thereby allowing each receiver to synchronize to its own preassigned time slots. An additional 12 bits in every time slot are for the SACCH (i.e. system control information). The digital verification color code (DVCC) is the equivalent of the supervisory audio tone used in the AMPS system. There are 256 different 8-bit color codes, which are protected by a (12, 8, 3) Hamming code. Each base station has its own preassigned color code, so any incoming interfering signals from distant cells can be ignored.

The modulation scheme for IS-54 is 7C/4 differential quaternary phase shift keying (DQPSK), otherwise known as differential 7t/4 4-PSK or π/4 DQPSK. This technique allows a bit rate of 48.6 kbit/s with 30 kHz channel spacing, to give a bandwidth efficiency of 1.62 bit/s/Hz. This value is 20% better than GSM. The major disadvantage with this type of linear modulation method is the power inefficiency, which translates into a heavier hand-held portable and, even more inconvenient, a shorter time between battery recharges.

==Call processing==
A conversation&#x27;s data bits makes up the DATA field. Six slots make up a complete IS-54 frame. DATA in slots 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6 make up a voice circuit. DVCC stands for digital verification color code, arcane terminology for a unique 8-bit code value assigned to each cell. G means guard time, the period between each time slot. RSVD stands for reserved. SYNC represents synchronization, a critical TDMA data field. Each slot in every frame must be synchronized against all others and a master clock for everything to work.

Time slots for the mobile-to-base direction are constructed differently from the base-to-mobile direction. They essentially carry the same information but are arranged differently. Notice that the mobile-to-base direction has a 6-bit ramp time to enable its transmitter time to get up to full power, and a 6-bit guard band during which nothing is transmitted. These 12 extra bits in the base-to-mobile direction are reserved for future use.

Once a call comes in the mobile switches to a different pair of frequencies; a voice radio channel which the system carrier has made analog or digital. This pair carries the call. If an IS-54 signal is detected it gets assigned a digital traffic channel if one is available. The fast associated channel or FACCH performs handoffs during the call, with no need for the mobile to go back to the control channel. In case of high noise, FACCH embedded within the digital traffic channel overrides the voice payload, degrading speech quality to convey control information. The purpose is to maintain connectivity. The slow associated control channel or SACCH does not perform handoffs but conveys things like signal strength information to the base station.

The IS-54 speech coder uses the technique called vector sum excited linear prediction (VSELP) coding. This is a special type of speech coder within a large class known as code-excited linear prediction (CELP) coders. The speech coding rate of 7.95 kbit/s achieves a reconstructed speech quality similar to that of the analog AMPS system using frequency modulation. The 7.95-kbit/s signal is then passed through a channel coder that loads the bit rate up to 13 kbit/s. The new half-rate coding standard reduces the overall bit rate for each call to 6.5 kbit/s, and should provide comparable quality to the 13-kbit/s rate. This half-rate gives a channel capacity six times that of analog AMPS.

==System example==
The discussion of a communication system will not be complete without the explanation of a system example. A dual-mode cellular phone as specified by the IS-54 standard is explained. A dual-mode phone is capable of operating in an analog-only cell or a dual-mode cell. Both the transmitter and the receiver support both analog FM and digital time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. Digital transmission is preferred, so when a cellular system has digital capability, the mobile unit is assigned a digital channel first. If no digital channels are available, the cellular system will assign an analog channel. The transmitter converts the audio signal to a radio frequency (RF), and the receiver converts an RF signal to an audio signal. The antenna focuses and converts RF energy for reception and transmission into free space. The control panel serves as an input/output mechanism for the end user; it supports a keypad, a display, a microphone, and a speaker. The coordinator synchronizes the transmission and receives functions of the mobile unit.
A dual-mode cellular phone consists of the following:

* Transmitter
* Antenna assembly
* Receiver
* Control panel
* Coordinator

==Successor technologies==
By 1993 American cellular was again running out of capacity, despite a wide movement to IS-54. The American cellular business continued booming. Subscribers grew from one and a half million customers in 1988 to more than thirteen million subscribers in 1993. Room existed for other technologies to cater to the growing market. The technologies that followed IS-54 stuck to the digital backbone laid down by it.

===IS-136===
A pragmatic effort was launched to improve IS-54 that eventually added an extra channel to the IS-54 hybrid design. Unlike IS-54, IS-136 utilizes time-division multiplexing for both voice and control channel transmissions. Digital control channel allows residential and in-building coverage, dramatically increased battery standby time, several messaging applications, over the air activation and expanded data applications. IS-136 systems needed to support millions of AMPS phones, most of which were designed and manufactured before IS-54 and IS-136 were considered. IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification, including text messaging, circuit switched data (CSD), and an improved compression protocol. IS-136 TDMA traffic channels use π/4-DQPSK modulation at a 24.3-kilobaud channel rate and gives an effective 48.6 kbit/s data rate across the six time slots comprising one frame in the 30 kHz channel.

==Sunset for D-AMPS in the US and Canada==
AT&amp;T Mobility, the largest US carrier to support D-AMPS (which it refers to as &quot;TDMA&quot;), had turned down its existing network in order to release the spectrum to its GSM and UMTS platforms in 19 wireless markets, which started on May 30, 2007, with other areas that followed in June and July. The TDMA network in these markets operated on the 1900 MHz frequency and did not coexist with an AMPS network. Service on the remaining 850 MHz TDMA markets was discontinued along with AMPS service on February 18, 2008, except for in areas where service was provided by Dobson Communications. The Dobson TDMA and AMPS network was shut down March 1, 2008.

On May 31, 2007, Rogers Wireless decommissioned its D-AMPS and AMPS networks and moved the remaining customers on these older networks onto its GSM network.

Alltel completed their shutdown of their D-AMPS and AMPS networks in September 2008. The last carrier in the United States to operate a D-AMPS network was U.S. Cellular, who shut down its D-AMPS network on February 10, 2009.

<doc id="483986" wikidata="Q267138" url="?curid=483986" title="Yahoo Serious">
<text>Yahoo Serious (born Greg Pead; 27 July 1953) is an Australian actor. His films include the comedy films &quot;Young Einstein&quot; (1988), &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot; (1993), and &quot;Mr. Accident&quot; (2000). Serious writes, directs, produces, stars in, and has composed the scores for his movies.

==Early life==
Serious, born Greg Gomez Pead, was born on 27 July 1953 in Cardiff, New South Wales. He attended Glendale East Public School and Cardiff High School, then worked as a tyre fitter to pay for his tuition at the National Art School in Sydney, but was expelled.

==Career==
After being expelled from art school, Serious co-wrote, co-produced, edited and directed at age 21 his first film, &quot;Coaltown&quot;, &quot;with the assistance of the Australian Film Institute&quot;. Released in 1977, &quot;Coaltown&quot; explores the social and political history of coal mining.

In 1988, Serious co-wrote, produced, directed, and played the title role in &quot;Young Einstein&quot; as a young apple farmer in Tasmania who derives the formula E=mc² while trying to discover a means of creating beer bubbles, splitting the beer atom in the process. After leaving Tasmania for Sydney on the mainland to patent his discovery, he goes on to develop rock music and surfing, romances Marie Curie, and saves Paris from an atomic bomb. The film&#x27;s popularity propelled Serious to stardom which saw him appear on the cover of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine and the Australian edition of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, and even get his own primetime slot on MTV. The movie was a success in Australia but a critical and commercial flop upon receiving a wide release in the United States.

In 1993, Serious released his next film, &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot;, a satire about a modern descendant of the notorious Australian bank robber Ned Kelly who also becomes a movie star in Hollywood. While &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot; was a hit in Australia, it failed outside of the country and ended Serious&#x27;s bid for mainstream international popularity. In 2000, Serious released his third film, &quot;Mr. Accident&quot;, about the most accident-prone man in the world. Like &quot;Reckless Kelly&quot;, the film was not a commercial success outside Australia.

Serious is a director of the Kokoda Track Foundation, a humanitarian organisation focused on Papua New Guinea.

In 2019, in a rare Q&amp;A session at Sydney&#x27;s Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace, Serious stated in response to a question about what he had been doing recently, “I have been writing and I hope to continue to make some more movies.” 

==Honours and awards==

Serious received an honorary doctorate from the University of Newcastle in 1996.

Serious was a guest celebrity for the opening of the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

==Personal life==
Shortly after the production of &quot;Young Einstein&quot;, Serious married Lulu Pinkus. Their relationship ended in 2007.

In July 2020, Serious was evicted from his Sydney rental property and ordered to pay $15,000 in rent arrears to the landlords. Serious stated that he was unable to pay due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but was unable to substantiate this claim.

==Lawsuit against Yahoo!==
In August 2000, Yahoo Serious sued the search engine Yahoo! for trademark infringement. The case was thrown out because Serious could not prove that he sells products or services under the name &quot;Yahoo&quot; and therefore could not prove that he suffered harm or confusion due to the search engine.

<doc id="483991" wikidata="Q4034" url="?curid=483991" title="Wudang Mountains">
<text>The Wudang Mountains () are a mountain range in the northwestern part of Hubei, China. They are home to a famous complex of Taoist temples and monasteries associated with the Lord of the North, Xuantian Shangdi. The Wudang Mountains are renowned for the practice of tai chi and Taoism as the Taoist counterpart to the Shaolin Monastery, which is affiliated with Chan Buddhism. The Wudang Mountains are one of the &quot;Four Sacred Mountains of Taoism&quot; in China, an important destination for Taoist pilgrimages. The monasteries such as the Wudang Garden were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 because of their religious significance and architectural achievement.

==Geography==
On Chinese maps, the name &quot;Wudangshan&quot; () is applied both to the entire mountain range (which runs east-west along the southern edge of the Han River, crossing several county-level divisions of Shiyan), and to the group of peaks located within Wudangshan subdistrict of Danjiangkou, Shiyan. It is the latter specific area which is known as a Taoist center.

Modern maps show the elevation of the highest of the peaks in the Wudang Shan &quot;proper&quot; as 1612 meters; however, the entire Wudangshan range has somewhat higher elevations elsewhere.

Some consider the Wudang Mountains to be a &quot;branch&quot; of the Daba Mountains range, which is a major mountain system in western Hubei, Shaanxi, Chongqing and Sichuan.

==History==
For centuries, the mountains of Wudang have been known as an important center of Taoism, especially famous for its Taoist versions of martial arts or tai chi.
The first sacred site—the Five Dragons Temple—was constructed at the behest of Emperor Taizong of Tang. Further structures were added during the Song and Yuan dynasties, while the largest complex on the mountain was built during the Ming dynasty (14th–17th centuries) as the Yongle Emperor claimed to enjoy the protection of the god Beidi or Xuantian Shangdi. During the Ming Dynasty, 9 palaces, 9 monasteries, 36 nunneries and 72 temples were located at the site. Temples regularly had to be rebuilt, and not all survived; the oldest existing structures are the Golden Hall and the Ancient Bronze Shrine, made in 1307. Other noted structures include Nanyang Palace (built in 1285–1310 and extended in 1312), the stone-walled Forbidden City of the Taihe Palace at the peak (built in 1419), and the Purple Cloud Temple (built in 1119–1126, rebuilt in 1413 and extended in 1803–1820). Today, 53 ancient buildings still survive. 

On January 19, 2003, the 600-year-old Yuzhengong Palace at the Wudang Mountains burned down after accidentally being set on fire by an employee of a martial arts school. A fire broke out in the hall, reducing the three rooms that covered 200 square meters to ashes. A gold-plated statue of Zhang Sanfeng, which was usually housed in Yuzhengong, was moved to another building just before the fire, and so escaped destruction in the inferno.

==Association with martial arts==

At the first national martial arts tournament organized by the Central Guoshu Institute in 1928, participants were separated into practitioners of Shaolin and Wudang styles. Styles considered to belong to the latter group—called &quot;Wudangquan&quot;—are those with a strong element of Taoist &quot;neidan&quot; exercises. Typical examples of Wudangquan are tai chi, &quot;xingyiquan, Bajiquan and&quot; &quot;baguazhang&quot;. According to legend, tai chi was created by the Taoist hermit sage Zhang Sanfeng, who lived in the Wudang mountains.

&quot;Wudangquan&quot; has been partly reformed to fit the PRC sport and health promotion program. The third biannual Traditional Wushu Festival was held in the Wudang Mountains from October 28 to November 2, 2008.

<text>The Naikaku Sōri Daijin Kantei (内閣総理大臣官邸) or Prime Minister&#x27;s Office is the official workplace of the Prime Minister of Japan. It is commonly referred to as , or simply . Unlike many other famous offices or palaces of heads of states, such as the Kremlin in Russia or the White House in the United States, the Japanese Prime Minister&#x27;s Office has no nickname. &quot;Naikaku Sōri Daijin Kantei&quot; literally translates to &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s Office&quot; in English. 

Located at 2-3-1 Nagata-chō, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100–8968, it is diagonally adjacent to the National Diet Building. The term &quot;Kantei&quot; is used as a metonym for the office of the Prime Minister of Japan and for the Prime Minister&#x27;s advisors and administration in general.

In addition to being the principal office of the Prime Minister, the building also serves as the principal office of the Chief Cabinet Secretary and their Deputy, the location of Cabinet meetings, and is also the location of a national crisis management center.

== Usage ==
The 1st floor contains a press conference room where the Prime Minister and the Chief Cabinet Secretary hold press conferences. On the 4th floor there is a room where the Cabinet holds meetings, summits, etc. The 5th floor has the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, their Reception Room, the Chief Cabinet Secretary&#x27;s office and reception room. 

== History ==

===Current Office===
A new five-storied office building was built in 2002, with 2.5 times the floor space. Installed with solar panels and a rainwater storage system, the new building has been designed to minimize environmental impact. The new residence went into service in April 2002

In an April 2015 incident, a Phantom 2 drone carrying traces of radiation was found on the roof of the PM&#x27;s office.

In October 2024, a vehicle used by Atsunobu Usuda crashed into a police barricade near the PMO.

===Previous Office===
The former office building is now known as the , the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal residential quarters. 

With the evolution of a national parliament after the Meiji Restoration and the establishment of the post of &quot;Prime Minister of Japan&quot; in 1885, the need for an official prime ministerial residence was felt. On the encouragement of Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi, the first residence was completed on 18 March 1929. It incorporates architectural styles such as Art Deco and expressionist architecture which became popular from the late Taishō period to the early Shōwa period. It was heavily influenced by the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, in particular his design for the second Tokyo Imperial Hotel. It is a two-storied mansion designed by Muraji Shimomoto, of the Ministry of the Treasury (now Ministry of Finance). Prime Minister Tanaka is said to have exclaimed, &quot;This is just like a café, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, upon seeing the building.

By the 1990s, the old building was deemed cramped and insufficient. It underwent seismic retrofitting and internal renovation.

<doc id="484007" wikidata="Q1262861" url="?curid=484007" title="Red goshawk">
<text>The red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiatus) is probably the rarest Australian bird of prey. It is found mainly in the savanna woodlands of northern Australia, particularly near watercourses. It takes a broad range of live prey, mostly birds.

==Taxonomy==
The red goshawk was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Falco radiatus&quot;.

The species used to be regarded as a very large member of the goshawk subfamily, Accipitrinae, but it is now believed that the resemblance to these other birds is convergent. Experts now group the red goshawk with the superficially dissimilar black-breasted buzzard &quot;Hamirostra melanosternon&quot; and square-tailed kite &quot;Lophoictinia isura&quot; as one of the Australasian old endemic raptors. It is believed that the ancestors of these birds, possibly together with a handful of species from South-east Asia and Africa, occupied Gondwana and over millions of years have diverged into their current forms.
Gene sequencing studies have found a relationship between &quot;Hamirostra&quot; and &quot;Lophoictinia&quot;, however samples had not been obtained from &quot;Erythrotriorchis&quot;.

==Description==

Plumage is generally rufous; on the head streaked with black and white, having more white on the face and throat; on the upper surfaces (body and upperwings) marked with black. Flight feathers and tail are barred grey, dark above and light below. Underside (belly and underwing coverts) are rufous with slight black ticking. The female has a paler belly than the male. Juveniles (first year) have less streaking on the head.

Adults have yellow irides (brown to yellow in the male); juveniles brown. The cere and skin around the eye vary from pale-blue in the juvenile through pale blue-grey to pale-grey in the adult. Adults&#x27; legs and feet are yellow; juveniles are pale grey, cream, or pale yellow.

Wings are long, broad and fingered at the tips. Its long wings are unlike the short wings of the &quot;Accipiter&quot; goshawks. Its tail is long and broad; square-tipped and about half its total length. It has a robust bill, slight brow ridge, and very heavy feet with bare tarsi having scutellate scale pattern.

Pattern of direct flight is described as &quot;sometimes leisurely, rather heavy and crow-like, with sustained flapping&quot;. Pursuit is &quot;powerful and energetic with deep, fluid wing beats, like a fast-flying Brown Falcon&quot;. It soars with wings raised in a slight dihedral, almost flat; glides with wings flat or slightly bowed; and sometimes stoops with closed wings. 

Size is 45–60 cm long, with 110–135 cm wingspan. Males weigh 635 g, females 1100–1400 g. The female is similar in size to a whistling kite, and the male to a female brown falcon.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for red goshawk conservation are Lilyvale in Far North Queensland, Kakadu Savanna and the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory, and Mornington Sanctuary in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
The nest is built in an exposed fork of a tall emergent tree. It is a stick platform lined with green leaves, 60–120 cm across and 30–50 cm deep.

The egg-laying season is from May to October in the tropical north, and August to October in the east. Incubation takes 40 days, the nestling period 51–53 days, and juveniles remain dependent for 2–3 months.

===Diet===
Red goshawks eat mostly birds, especially parrots and pigeons; rarely they also prey on mammals, reptiles, and large insects.

Early and late in the day, they hunt from concealed perches in the trees. In the middle of the day, they use long transects, quartering through or above the canopy, or search from a high soaring position. They attack by a stealthy glide, direct chase, or may stoop from a height.

==Status==
The red goshawk is listed nationally as endangered under the federal &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; EPBC and is listed as endangered in Queensland and New South Wales and as vulnerable in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is also listed under the &quot;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&quot; CITES.

The species is sparsely dispersed throughout its range across Australia but recent significant declines have been cause for concern. The main threats and causes of declines in eastern Australia have been attributed to clearing of forests and woodlands for agriculture which leads to degradation of remaining habitat, reduced available prey and reduction in suitable nesting sites.

The protection of remaining intact habitat and the recovery of suitable habitat through rehabilitation through regulation on land clearing is an important conservation management tool for their survival.

<doc id="484016" wikidata="Q467767" url="?curid=484016" title="Fiat 500">
<text>The Fiat 500 (, ) is an economy / city car that was manufactured and marketed by Fiat Automobiles from 1957 until 1975. It was sold as a two-door semi-convertible or saloon car and as a three-door panel van or estate car.

Launched as the &quot;Nuova (new) 500&quot; in July 1957, as a successor to the 500 &quot;Topolino&quot;, it was an inexpensive and practical small car. Measuring long, and originally powered by a rear-mounted 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the 500 was smaller than Fiat&#x27;s 600, launched two years earlier, and is considered one of the first purpose-designed city cars.

In 1959, Dante Giacosa received a Compasso d&#x27;Oro industrial design prize for the Fiat 500. This marked the first time a Compasso d’Oro was awarded to an automotive manufacturer.

==History==
In 1936, Fiat released the front engine Fiat 500 &quot;Topolino&quot; economy car. In 1949 to meet the demands of the post-war market, production resumed as the 500C with revised front and rear bodywork. Initially, it only had a 2-door coupé body with sun-roof, like before the war, which was later complemented by an Estate version, importantly offering some family-valued rear seating space. Both continued until 1957 when they were replaced by an all-new, lighter car. The new car had a rear-mounted engine, on the pattern of the Volkswagen Beetle, just like its bigger brother, the 1955 Fiat 600. Several car makers followed the until then uncommon rear engine and drive configuration at the time and were quite successful. From October 1961, a &#x27;Neckar&#x27; version of the 500 was manufactured in Heilbronn, Germany, under a complicated deal involving NSU motorcars, and Steyr-Puch produced a Fiat 500 version under licence in Graz, Austria.

Despite its very small size, the 500 proved to be an enormously practical vehicle with large sales throughout Europe. Besides the two-door saloon, it was also available as the &quot;Giardiniera&quot; estate; this variant featured the standard engine laid on its side, the wheelbase lengthened by to provide a more convenient rear seat, a full-length sunroof and larger brakes from the Fiat 600.

Although only the 1958-61 Fiat 500N (Normale) was the only version officially sold in North America, the Fiat 500 was a popular gray-market car in the 1960s and 1970s, with private imports in the thousands.

Sports models were produced by Abarth, as well as by Giannini. An Austrian variant, produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the 1957–1973 Steyr-Puch 500, had a Puch boxer twin motor, a sports model of which was the 1965–1969 Steyr-Puch 650 TR2.

Production of the 500 ended in 1975, although its replacement, the Fiat 126, was launched two years earlier. The 126 was not as successful as its predecessor in Italy, but sold well in the Eastern Bloc countries, being assembled and manufactured in Poland as a Polski Fiat. The Fiat 500 has a Cx (aerodynamic resistance coefficient) of 0,38, a very good performance for its time.

In 2006 the magazine Top Gear voted the Fiat 500 &quot;the sexiest car&quot;

In 2007, the 50th anniversary of the Nuova 500&#x27;s launch, Fiat launched another new 500, stylistically inspired by the 1957 Nuova 500, featuring a front-mounted engine and front-wheel drive.

In 2017 Fiat celebrated the 60th anniversary with an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and received one of the Corporate Art Awards by pptArt at an event hosted by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace.

==Models==
===&quot;Nuova&quot; 500 (1957–1960)===

The 500 features a 479 cc (500cc nominal) two-cylinder engine, hence the name, producing just 13 horsepower. This model also features a fabric roof, foldable to the rear of the vehicle, like that of a Fiat 500 Topolino — rather than the later roof design, which only folds half way back along the roof. The Nuova 500 is one of three models featuring &quot;suicide doors.&quot;

Including the Sport model, in total 181,036 examples of the &quot;Nuova&quot; 500 were produced from 1957 until 1960.

===&quot;Nuova&quot; 500 Sport (1958–1960)===
In mid-1958 Fiat introduced the Nuova 500 Sport, featuring a more powerful engine and a two-tone livery—white with a red stripe along the flanks. Unique to the Sport was an all-metal rigid roof with three longitudinal grooves. A short-open-roof model was added a year later, in 1959.

Coded type &quot;110.004&quot;, the 500 Sport&#x27;s two-cylinder engine had been bored out to 499.5 cc from the original 479 cc (bore and stroke now ), giving it a very respectable horsepower with the same block: . Top speed was over .

===500 D (1960–1965)===

Replacing the original Nuova in 1960, the D looks very similar to the Nuova, but there are two key differences. One is the engine size (the D features an uprated 499 cc engine producing 17 bhp as standard—this engine is used right through until the end of the L in 1973) and the other is the roof: the standard D roof does not fold back as far as the roof on the Nuova, though it was also available as the &quot;Transformable&quot; with the same roof as the Nuova. The D also features &quot;suicide doors&quot;.

In New Zealand, where it was locally assembled by Torino Motors, the 500 D was sold as the &quot;Fiat Bambina&quot; (Italian for &quot;baby&quot;), a name that is still in use there to describe this car.

===500 Giardiniera (1960–1968)===

The 500 Giardiniera (500 K on some markets) estate version of the Fiat 500 is the longest running model. The engine is laid under the floor of the boot to create a flat loading surface. The roof on this model also stretches all the way to the rear, not stopping above the driver and front passenger as it does in other models of the same period. The Giardiniera also features &quot;suicide doors&quot; and was the only model to continue to use this door type into the 1970s. In 1966 production was transferred to Desio where the Giardiniera was built by Fiat subsidiary Autobianchi under their marque from 1968 to 1977. A total of 327,000 Giardinieras were produced, and from 1968 sold only as Autobianchi Giardiniera.

===500 Furgoncino===
A panel van variant of the &quot;Giardiniera&quot; (estate) was offered as the &quot;Furgoncino&quot;.

===500 F or &quot;Berlina&quot; (1965–1972)===

The F spans two periods of 500 production, the D and the L. As such, it is the most frequently misidentified model. Between 1965 and 1969 the F carried the same badging as the D, but the two models are distinguishable by the positioning of their door hinges. The D has &quot;suicide doors&quot;: the F, produced from June 1965, at last featured front-hinged doors. This was the result of new safety regulations which required front-hinged doors on passenger cars - the Giardiniera was officially a commercial vehicle and was thus allowed to retain the original, rear-hinged design. Between 1969 and 1972 the F was sold alongside the &quot;Lusso&quot; model as a cheaper &quot;base model&quot; alternative. While the F and L are mechanically very similar, the key differences are the bumpers (the L has an extra chrome nudge bar) and the interior (the F interior is nearly identical to the original 1957 design while the L sports a much more modern look).

===500 L or &quot;Lusso&quot; (1968–1972)===

In September 1968 Fiat put on sale the 500 L or &quot;Lusso&quot; (&quot;tipo 110 F/L&quot;), a more richly trimmed and better appointed version of the standard 500 F. The 500 L remained on sale until 1972, when the new Fiat 126 was introduced.

Perhaps the most obvious new feature of the 500 L were tubular guards protecting the front bumper and the corners of the rear one. As a result, the car was about longer than the 500 F at . Other model-specific exterior items were a new Fiat badge at the front, redesigned hubcaps, chrome plastic mouldings covering the roof drip rails, and bright trim around windscreen and rear window. Inside the dashboard was entirely covered in black anti-glare plastic material instead of being bare painted metal, and was fitted with a new trapezoid instrument binnacle replacing the round one used on all other 500 models. The steering wheel was black plastic with metal spokes. The door cards—upholstered in the same pleated pattern leatherette used on the seats—carried redesigned and relocated door handles and new door pockets. More storage space was provided in the form of a tray on the centre tunnel, which like the rest of the floor was covered in carpet rather than rubber mats.
Except for radial instead of bias ply tires, from a mechanical standpoint the 500 L was identical to the coeval 500 F.
===500 R or &quot;Rinnovata&quot; (1972–1975)===
The last incarnation of the Fiat 500 was the R model, or &quot;Rinnovata&quot; (Renovated). Launched alongside the new Fiat 126 in November 1972, it had the same 594 cc engine of the 126, however, the power rating is the same as the L but at lower rpm (4000 instead of 4400) and with a bit more torque; a full synchromesh gearbox is still missing. The floor-pan which was from either the &#x27;L&#x27;, or later, the new 126. It was also more comfortable, but more simply trimmed and equipped than before — the fuel gauge was omitted and only the low fuel indicator remained. The 500 R was also a stop-gap for Fiat prior to the launch of the Fiat 126, and when the new 126 was launched, sales of the old Fiat 500 R plummeted. It was sold alongside the Fiat 126 for another three years before Fiat retired the 500.
===Fiat 500 &quot;America&quot;===

During the years in which it was produced the 500 in Italy, Fiat designed and produced a US-market version of the car with 15hp using the 479cc engine. Changes to the car include prominent headlamps to meet US standards (also used on the American 500 Jolly). They also came equipped with larger front and rear bumpers with bumperettes, and a speedometer in MPH. It can also be noted that there were 4 tail lights used for the N model however only 3 were used for the American version. In 1958 it is believed that Carello (the producer of the tail lights for Fiat) began a strike leading to changes in the design. Thus leading the 58&#x27;s to have a color matched base with the body, early 59&#x27;s to have an aluminum base thicker than the European model, and late 59 and 60&#x27;s to have a &quot;D model&quot; style base. The 1958 Fiat 500 America came equipped with a flat floor pan which was later revised for the 1959 and 1960 version to have a scoop for more leg room. Another notable difference is in the routing of the heating tubes between these earlier years. Towards the end of 59 models Fiat began transitioning to their D model. Some notable changes include the different tail lights, removal of the fresh air vents on the nose, and only 2 water drainage ports (downgraded from the 3 previous years had) along the bottom of the doors. About 300 were made between 1958 and 1960 at which point they were discontinued as they did not do well in the American market compared to the competition. 
There was a special &quot;sport&quot; version of this car were the engine was bored out to 499.5 to produce 21 hp, coming only in white with a red stripe across the car. 

===Derivatives===

====Abarth 695 SS (1964–1971)====
Of all the performance-oriented models created by Karl Abarth, later known as Carlo Abarth, perhaps the 695 &quot;esse esse&quot; is the best representation of the scorpion-branded firm&#x27;s collaboration with Fiat. Around 1,000 Fiat Abarth 695 SS were produced and only 150 are believed to remain.

Abarth introduced its 695 SS version in 1966, after the previous presentation back in 1964. The rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout Fiat 500 was the basis of the project. When compared to the production version of the 500, aesthetically the 695 was virtually identical except for the logo, badge on the radiator grille and the coat of arms on both sides of the car. The 695 SS was the only version to feature flared arches and the need to raise the engine cover for extra stability and cooling.

Like all Abarths, the differences are found in the mechanical upgrades that helped to increase its top speed to around . The OHV 2 valves per cylinder inline-two engine, exhaust pipe, head and valve-springs were upgraded and specially designed pistons and camshaft fitted. It had an equal square bore and stroke ratio of for a total displacement of and the original single Solex 34PBIC carburetor was increased in size with a compression ratio of 9.8:1 developing at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm.

====Fiat 500 Jolly Ghia====
Carrozzeria Ghia custom manufactured a &quot;Jolly&quot; variant of the 500, inspired by the limited edition Fiat 600 Jolly, and featuring an open-air, doorless design with wicker seats and a removable fabric canopy roof — similar in concept to the Citroën Méhari, BMC Mini Moke and Volkswagen Type 181.

==2007 Fiat 500==

First announced in May 2006, Fiat previewed an all-new four-seat three-door hatchback 500 model in March 2007 – fifty years after the first Fiat 500 was presented. The design of the 2007 Fiat 500 is based on the 2004 Fiat Trepiùno concept.

The new model features a distinctive retro style – following the pattern of the Volkswagen New Beetle and BMW MINI – as modern reinterpretation of Dante Giacosa&#x27;s 1957 original rear-engined Fiat 500. Production started in mid-2007 in Fiat facilities in Tychy, Poland, and later in Toluca, Mexico. Numerous trim, equipment, and performance versions are offered with a convertible body style available starting in 2009.

The 500 is also offered in Abarth trim, with 1.4L Turbo Petrol engine, sport exhaust, suspension, and transmission.

The Fiat 500 automobile platform is the basis of the second-generation Ford Ka.

<text>Baruch College (officially the Bernard M. Baruch College) is a public college in New York City, United States. It is a constituent college of the City University of New York system. Named for financier and statesman Bernard M. Baruch, the college operates undergraduate and postgraduate programs through the Zicklin School of Business, the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences, and the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs.

==History==

Baruch College is one of the senior colleges in the CUNY system. It traces its roots back to the 1847 founding of the Free Academy, the first institution of free public higher education in the United States. The New York State Literature Fund was created to serve students who could not afford to enroll in New York City&#x27;s private colleges. The Fund led to the creation of the Committee of the Board of Education of the City of New York, led by Townsend Harris, J.S. Bosworth, and John L. Mason, which brought about the establishment of what would become the Free Academy, on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.

The Free Academy became the College of the City of New York, now The City College of New York (CCNY). In 1919, what would become Baruch College was established as City College School of Business and Civic Administration. On December 15, 1928, the cornerstone was laid on the new building which would house the newly founded school. At this point, the school did not admit women. At the time it opened it was considered the biggest such school for the teaching of business education in the United States.

By the 1930s, women were enrolled in the School of Business. The total enrollment at CCNY reached an all-time high of 40,000 students in 1935, and the School of Business had an enrollment of more than 1,700 students in the day session alone. In 1953, it was renamed the Baruch School of Business in honor of Bernard Baruch, an 1889 graduate of CCNY who went on to become a prominent financier and adviser to two presidents. In 1961, the New York State Education Law established the City University of New York (CUNY) system. In 1968, the Baruch School of Business was spun off as Baruch College, an independent senior college in the CUNY system.

The first president of the new college (1969–1970) was the previous Federal Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Robert C. Weaver. In 1971, the college appointed Clyde Wingfield, a noted educator, as its president. He was succeeded by economist Joel Edwin Segall in 1977. Segall recruited several well-known faculty members to the School of Business and established the college&#x27;s permanent home on Lower Lexington Avenue. Matthew Goldstein was president of the school from 1991 to 1998 (he later went on to serve as the Chancellor of CUNY from 1999 to 2013). He was responsible for raising admissions requirements and creating the School of Public Affairs in 1994. Edward Regan, former comptroller of New York state, served as president from 2000 to 2004. During his tenure, test scores rose, student retention rates increased, and many new faculty members were hired. In 2001, the Vertical Campus opened and Baruch College accepted its first students from the CUNY Honors College, now known as the Macaulay Honors College. The college also implemented a common core curriculum for all undergraduates.

Kathleen Waldron became the president in 2004. Under Waldron, Baruch College received large donations from its alumni, which resulted in the Vertical Campus, 23rd Street building, and Performing Arts complex being renamed in honor of the three largest donors respectively. Alumni giving has increased under &quot;Baruch Means Business,&quot; a $150 million capital campaign. In August 2009, Waldron resigned from her position to become a University Professor at the Graduate Center. Stan Altman, the former dean of the School of Public Affairs from 1999 to 2005, was named interim president.

On February 22, 2010, Mitchel Wallerstein, dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, was appointed as the president of the college. He took office on August 2, 2010, and remained until June 30, 2020, after which he became a University Professor at CUNY. Under his leadership, Baruch College established degree programs with universities globally, ranked as a top college for social mobility, and achieved the best graduation rate within the CUNY system.

Baruch College was the scene of student protests in 2011 as a result of tuition hikes. This resulted in arrests.

S. David Wu is the current president of Baruch College, taking office on July 1, 2020.

It is now home to the Zicklin School of Business and the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences (the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs is housed in the Field Building). It houses classrooms, faculty offices, additional computer labs for student use, along with the Athletic and Recreation Complex (ARC), Cafeteria, and Baruch Bookstore. The Newman Vertical Campus received the American Institute of Architects&#x27; highest award for an individual building in 2003.

<doc id="484020" wikidata="Q933646" url="?curid=484020" title="Fiat 126">
<text>The Fiat 126 (Type 126) is a four-passenger, rear-engine, city car manufactured and marketed by Fiat over a twenty-eight year production run from 1972 until 2000, over a single generation. Introduced by Fiat in October 1972 at the Turin Auto Show, the 126 replaced the Fiat 500, using major elements from its design. A subsequent iteration, marketed as the &quot;126 Bis&quot;, used a horizontally oriented, water-cooled engine, and featured a rear hatchback with additional cargo space.

The majority of 126s (some 3.3 million) were manufactured in Tychy and Bielsko-Biała plants, Poland and were marketed as the [[Polski Fiat]] 126p in many markets. Fiat stopped marketing the 126 in 1993 in favor of its new front-engined Cinquecento. Total production reached approximately 4.7 million units.

In Poland, the car became a people&#x27;s car, and a cultural icon, earning the nickname &quot;Maluch&quot;, meaning &quot;The Little One&quot; or &quot;Toddler&quot;, a name that eventually became official in 1997, when &#x27;Maluch&#x27; started appearing, badged on the rear of the car.

Inearly 2020, the 28-year production run of the Fiat 126 was counted as the twenty-sixth most long-lived single-generation car in history by Autocar magazine.

== History ==
The 126 shared its wheelbase and much of the mechanical underpinnings and layout with the Fiat 500, featuring a revised, slightly larger bodyshell designed by Sergio Sartorelli with improved safety and interior space. The added interior space resulted from moving the starter from the top of the engine bellhousing to the side which permitted shifting the bulkhead/rear seat rearward approximately 10 cm, and the lengthening of the roof for rear-seat headroom.

The engine capacity was increased from 594 cc to 652 cc at the end of 1977 when the cylinder bore was increased from 73.5 to 77 mm. Claimed power output was unchanged at , but torque was increased from to . The 594 cc engines were still available in early 1983 production. The 652 cc engine was later also used in the Fiat Panda 30, but then positioned in the front and combined with front wheel drive.
A subsequent change in 1987 by FSM was the BIS version that was made until 1991. The 126 BIS gained a hatchback to access an additional cargo space on the rear, which was freed by replacing the air-cooled engine with the water-cooled 704 cc flat-twin.

The 126 was manufactured at Fiat&#x27;s Cassino and Termini Imerese plants until 1979, with an overall production of 1,352,912 manufactured in Italy.

The 126 was also manufactured under license by Zastava in Yugoslavia. In Austria, it was briefly assembled by Steyr Puch as a successor to the successful Puch 500, with the assembly of 2,069 cars through 1975. In Greece, there was an attempt to produce a small car named DIM whose technical layout was primarily based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.

The 126 did not achieve the popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, as the rear-engined layout was displaced by better packaging and handling front-engine, front-wheel drive cars. The 126 became one of the last and longest-production rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe, survived only by the VW Beetle whose production lasted until 1978 (2003, globally). The 126 was also the last rear-engine small car manufactured in Europe until the advent of the Smart Fortwo.

For a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the &quot;POP 650&quot; and a more luxurious model called the &quot;POP 2000&quot;.

== Polski Fiat 126p ==


In Poland, the car was produced under license by Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych (FSM) (En: Small-Displacement Car Factory) in Bielsko-Biała and Tychy under the brand Polski Fiat 126p (literally in English: &quot;Polish Fiat 126p&quot;) between 1973 and 2000.

Due to its relatively low price, it was prevalent in Poland and was arguably the most common Polish car in the 1980s. Its tiny size gave it the nickname maluch (&quot;the small one&quot;, &quot;small child&quot;, pronounced ). The nickname became so popular that in 1997, it was accepted by the manufacturer as the car&#x27;s official name.

At first, it was almost identical to the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy, but orange in other markets. The letter &quot;p&quot; was added to its name to distinguish it from the original Italian car.

Throughout the 1980s, the 126p was continuously modified. First, it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat. Hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.

In 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985, a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift and some parts from the Fiat Cinquecento; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.

In 1987, the 126 BIS began production, featuring a water-cooled 704 cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some parts from the Fiat Cinquecento.

The factory battery in 126p had a 35-amp hour capacity, which, combined with the undersized generator, the car had a fully charged battery only if driven for an extended time. Upgrading a 45-amp hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Litre engine) improved the cold start reliability.

The 126p was exported to many Eastern Bloc countries, and for several years, it was one of the most popular cars in Poland and in Hungary as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992 under the name FSM Niki. During that period, it was Australia&#x27;s cheapest car. There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market. It was also successful in Cuba where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10,000 are still registered today.

The 126p also has a history in China: In the early 1980s, it became one of the first passenger cars to be imported to the country. The government initially bought 10,000, mainly used as taxis, but later, the 126p became available for private buyers - a rarity in the country then. In the 1980s, it was one of the best-selling cars in China, selling around 30,000 units per year.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, several experimental prototypes were developed in Poland. A cargo version was designed in 1974 called &quot;Bombel&quot; (literally &quot;bubble&quot;, but also a colloquial term for &quot;small child&quot;) because of its fiberglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front-wheel drive, front-engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.

There was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric motor and motorcycle engine swaps.

=== Timeline of PF 126p ===
* 1972 – the FSM car factory was built in Bielsko-Biała.
* 6 June 1973 – the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts. The official price was 69,000 Polish złotys with PKO Bank Polski accepting pre-payments on savings books starting 5 February 1973.
* 22 July 1973 – the official opening of the factory&#x27;s production line. By the end of that year, over 1,500 Fiats were manufactured.
* September 1975 – production started in the Tychy factory.
* 1977 – engine capacity increased from 594 cc to 652 cc. Engine power increased to about .
* 1978 – production of types with engine capacity 594 cc ended.
* 1979 – production of Polski Fiat 126p continued only in Bielsko-Biała.
* 1981 – 1,000,000th Polski Fiat 126p produced.
* December 1984 – technical changes in the construction and body. Type &quot;FL&quot; introduced.
* 1987 – production begins of a water-cooled &quot;Polski Fiat 126p Bis&quot; version – a three-door hatchback with 704 cc capacity.
* May 1993 – 3,000,000th Polish Fiat 126p produced.
* September 1994 – body improvement, creating type &quot;el&quot; with parts similar to those used in Fiat Cinquecento.
* January 1997 – introduction of a catalytic converter.
* 22 September 2000 – production ended after a production run of 3,318,674 units. All Fiats of the last limited &quot;Happy End&quot; series were yellow or red (500 cars in red and 500 cars in yellow).

The car&#x27;s global production was 4,673,655 units: 1,352,912 in Italy, 2,069 in Austria by Fiat-Steyr, and 3,318,674 in Poland.

=== Political connotations ===
The PF 126p has a special meaning for Poles, and its story is connected to Polish politics during the communist period (Polish People&#x27;s Republic, up to 1989). During the absolute rule of the PZPR, a private car was considered a luxury item due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971, there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland. In a top-down planned economy, decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the Syrena, but it needed to be updated, and its production was low. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was challenging to buy a Western car because the Polish złoty, like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds, and the country had no free market.

Thus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular, and affordable car to provide mobility for ordinary families. The license was bought after the rise to power of a new PZPR leader, Edward Gierek, who wanted to gain popularity by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under Władysław Gomułka. Even though it was a tiny city car, it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a family car. During holidays, it was common to see families of four driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a roof rack; sightings of PF-126s towing a small Niewiadów N126 caravan especially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported. PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was on sale with a waiting list. Usually, families had to wait a few years to buy a car. The authorities could also give a coupon to purchase a car based on merit or relationship.

== Nicknames ==
In Polish it is called &quot;Maluch&quot;, which literally means &quot;small one&quot; or toddler (and was an official name since 1997), as well as &quot;mały Fiat&quot; (&quot;small Fiat&quot;), in contrast to Fiat 125p, called &quot;duży Fiat&quot; (&quot;big Fiat&quot;). In some regions, it is also called &quot;Kaszlak&quot;, literally &quot;cougher&quot; (derived from &quot;&quot;, &quot;cough&quot;, as its engine&#x27;s sound resembles a cough when it is started).

<text>Maybach (, ) is a German luxury car brand owned by and a part of Mercedes-Benz AG. The original company was founded in 1909 by Wilhelm Maybach and his son Karl Maybach, originally as a subsidiary of &quot;Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH&quot;, and it was known as &quot;Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH&quot; until 1999.
In 1960, Maybach was acquired by Daimler-Benz. The name returned as a standalone ultra-luxury car brand in 2002, sharing significant components with Mercedes-Benz cars. After slow sales, Maybach ceased to be a standalone brand by 2013, and it became (in 2015) a sub-brand of Mercedes-Benz, which the Mercedes-Benz Group owns. , Daimler produces an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV and the Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach name.

==1909–1940: Early history==
Wilhelm Maybach was the technical director of the &quot;Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft&quot; (DMG) until he left in 1907. On 23 March 1909, he founded the new company, &quot;Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH&quot; (literally &quot;Aircraft Engine Building Company&quot;), with his son Karl Maybach as director. In 1912, they renamed it to &quot;Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH&quot; (&quot;Maybach Engine Construction Company&quot;). The company originally developed and manufactured diesel and petrol engines for Zeppelins, and then rail cars. Its Maybach Mb.IVa was used in aircraft and airships of World War I.

The company first built an experimental car in 1919, introduced as a production model two years later at the Berlin Motor Show. Between 1921 and 1940, the company produced a variety of opulent vehicles, now regarded as classics. The company also continued to build heavy-duty diesel engines for marine and rail purposes.

Maybach had a British subsidiary, Maybach Gears Ltd., that specialised in gearboxes. In 1938, in conjunction with Dr Henry Merritt, they produced a gearbox and steering system – the &#x27;Merritt-Maybach&#x27; – for the abortive Nuffield A.16E1 Cruiser tank design.

==1940–1945==

During the Second World War, Maybach produced the engines for most of Nazi Germany&#x27;s tanks and half-tracks. These included almost all the production tank engines through Panzer I, II, III, IV and V, the Tiger I and II (Maybach HL230) and other heavy tanks: and also engines for half-tracks such as the Sd.Kfz. 251 personnel carrier and prime movers like the Sd.Kfz. 9. The engine plant was one of several industries targeted at Friedrichshafen.

After WWII, the factory performed some repair work, but automotive production was never restarted, and some 20 years later, the company was renamed MTU Friedrichshafen.

==1960s==
Daimler-Benz purchased the company in 1960. Post-1960, the company was mainly used to make special editions of Mercedes cars in the W108 and W116 model range, which were virtually hand built. These cars however carried the Mercedes badge and serial numbers.

Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG, based in Friedrichshafen, used to manufacture the commercial Maybach diesel engines under the MTU brand through its subsidiary MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH.

==1997–2013==
Daimler presented a luxury concept car at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show. A production model based on it was introduced in two sizes – the Maybach 57 and the Maybach 62, reflecting the lengths of the automobiles in decimetres. In 2005 the 57S was added, powered by a 6.0 L V12 bi-turbo engine producing and of torque, and featuring various cosmetic touches.

To promote the new Maybach line, Mercedes-Benz engaged figures such as Maybach heir Ulrich Schmid-Maybach and golfer Nick Faldo to serve as brand ambassadors.

Initially, Daimler-Chrysler predicted annual sales of 2,000 worldwide with 50 percent coming from the United States; however, these expectations never materialized. In 2007, Mercedes bought back 29 US dealers, reducing the total from 71 to 42. In 2010, only 157 Maybachs were sold worldwide, compared to 2,711 similarly priced Rolls-Royces. By the time of the announcement that the brand was to be laid back to rest, 3,000 had been sold worldwide since the brand was revived in 2002.

Daimler announced in November 2011 that Maybach would cease to be a brand by 2013 and manufactured the last Maybach vehicle in December 2012. This was because of poor sales.

===Cancellation===
With poor sales and the heavy impact of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Daimler AG undertook a complete review of the Maybach division, approaching Aston Martin to engineer and style the next generation of Maybach models along with the next generation of Lagondas. According to &quot;Automotive News&quot;, only 44 Maybachs had been sold in the US in the first ten months of 2011.

An article in &quot;Fortune&quot; noted that Mercedes had missed out on the chance to purchase Rolls-Royce and Bentley when they were up for sale in the 1990s: &quot;Mercedes backpedaled and decided it needed to be in the ultra-luxury business too, but it went after it in a remarkably clumsy way. 
It further stated that the first Maybach models had poor driving dynamics compared to its contemporaries from Rolls-Royce and Bentley.
Mercedes took an aging S-class chassis and plopped an absurdly elongated body on it ... rather than develop a new car from the wheels up, as BMW did with Rolls-Royce, or cleverly use the underpinnings of an existing model like the Volkswagen Phaeton for a new Bentley.&quot; 
Furthermore, Maybachs were never advertised as owner-driven vehicles, as the company believed that the luxury amenities would be sufficient to drive sales, and they even insisted that auto journalists (who usually test drive the vehicle) ride in the back seat.

Another suggestion for Maybach&#x27;s struggles was that parent Daimler had failed to differentiate it from its Mercedes-Benz brand. While all three ultra-luxury marques share platforms and engines with other luxury brands from their parent auto company, Maybachs are built alongside the Mercedes-Benz S-Class flagship sedan, whereas Rolls-Royce and Bentley are assembled in England (separate from the rest of BMW and Volkswagen Group&#x27;s respective production plants), and thus are regarded as being more &quot;exclusive&quot;. Furthermore, the Maybach&#x27;s pedigree was virtually unknown outside of Germany, unlike its British rivals which have long enjoyed renown worldwide; indeed the 2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom&#x27;s interior evokes memories of a 1930s car while the Maybach 57S&#x27;s inside makes no reference to its marque&#x27;s history.

In November 2011, Daimler&#x27;s CEO Dieter Zetsche announced that the Maybach-brand would cease to exist in 2012, making room for other models of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The Maybach-limousines were still being sold up to the year 2013, but after that, the name &quot;Maybach&quot; would not be used. On 14 August 2012, parent Daimler AG announced the official discontinuation of Maybach by releasing a price sheet officially discontinuing the Maybach 57, 57S, 62, 62S and Landaulet. On 17 December 2012, the last Maybach vehicle was manufactured in Sindelfingen.

==2015–present==

===Revival===
The company announced that the line would be replaced by the next-generation of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Model W222, due for the 2014 model year, particularly the long wheelbase S-Class Pullman. An executive told a Frankfurt newspaper that &quot;Daimler came to the conclusion that the sales chances for the Mercedes brand were better than that of Maybach.&quot;

===Mercedes-Maybach===
In November 2014, Daimler announced the revival of the Maybach name as a sub-brand of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222), positioned as an upscale version akin to the more sporty Mercedes-AMG sub-brand. In anticipation of its April 2015 launch, the flagship Mercedes-Maybach S600 was unveiled at car shows in Los Angeles, United States, and Guangzhou, China, and the production model at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. During the facelift, the S 500 and S 550 were redesignated S 560 and the flagship was renamed S 650.

Assembled on the same Sindelfingen line used for the S-Class, the model is targeted against the Bentley Mulsanne and Rolls-Royce Phantom. At long with a wheelbase of (132.5 inches), it is approximately longer than the long-wheelbase S-Class models. The Mercedes-Maybach will be available as S500 (S550 in the US) and S600 models, with 4matic all-wheel-drive optional with the V8 engine. Acceleration is in 5.0 seconds. The base car has several colour finish options and the choice between a three-seat rear bench, or two seats reclining. Options include: air-conditioned, heated and massaging seats; heated armrests; a system to pump scented, ionised air around the cabin; and a 1540 watt Burmester 3D surround sound system with 24 speakers. Maybach S500 assembly in Pune, India, began in September 2015, making India the second country to produce a Maybach.

===Concept cars===
The first Mercedes-Maybach concept car is the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6, a large two-door coupe with a fully electric drivetrain. The model was unveiled at the 2016 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

<text>Lehman College is a public college in New York City. Founded in 1931 as the Bronx campus of Hunter College, it became an independent college in 1967. The college is named after Herbert H. Lehman, a former New York governor, United States senator, and philanthropist. It is a senior college of the City University of New York (CUNY) and offers more than 90 undergraduate and graduate degree programs and specializations.

==History==

The Bronx Branch of Hunter College was first established in 1931.

The campus was the main national training ground for women in the military during World War II. For a decade before the entry of the United States in World War II, only women students attended, taking their first two years of study at the Bronx campus and then transferring to Hunter&#x27;s Manhattan campus to complete their undergraduate work. During the war, Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the United States Navy who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as WAVES and SPARS.

When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was occupied for six months in 1946 by the nascent United Nations, which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx campus. From March to August 1946, the first American meetings of the United Nations Security Council were held in the Gymnasium Building where intercollegiate basketball, archery, swimming, and other sports have been played. During festivities marking the 40th anniversary of the United Nations in 1986, the Southern New York State Division of the United Nations Association presented the college with a commemorative plaque, now displayed outside the Gymnasium Building. The college participated in the United Nations’ 50th anniversary activities in 1995–96.

The process of separating Lehman College from its Hunter College-affiliated predecessor began in 1967, culminating in the establishment of an independent unit of the City University of New York on July 1, 1968. This new college, known as Herbert H. Lehman College or Lehman College, was established as a senior undergraduate college. The newly established school was named after Herbert H. Lehman, the former, four-term governor of New York. Lehman College&#x27;s founding president was Leonard Lief.

President Lief was succeeded by Ricardo R. Fernández in 1991. In 2016, José Luis Cruz was appointed as the third president of the college. In 2019, Cruz was appointed as the CUNY Executive Vice Chancellor and stepped down from the Lehman presidency. On February 21, 2021, the CUNY board of trustees appointed Fernando Delgado to succeed interim president Daniel Lemons as the fourth president of the college.

The college switched to remote learning on March 11, 2020, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Later, in April, the university released a study that concluded that the virus could be spread through a building&#x27;s ventilation system. On October 5, 2020, 98% of classes were fully online due to the coronavirus pandemic. On May 26, 2022, after two years of conducting commencement ceremonies online due to the COVID-19 restrictions regarding mass gathering in NYC, Lehman held its first commencement ceremony post COVID-19 lockdowns.

==Campus==

Lehman has a 37-acre (15 hectare) campus with a combination of Collegiate Gothic and modern architecture, located near the Jerome Park Reservoir at 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West (250 West 200th Street). The school&#x27;s architects were Kerr Rainsford, John A. Thompson, and Gerald A. Holmes; they had earlier designed the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side.

Lehman College houses a multimedia center in Carman Hall, comprising an acoustically designed recording studio, audio and video production control rooms, editing suites, student newsroom, media conversion room, graphics room, and &quot;technology-enhanced&quot; classrooms. BronxNet public access channel is also headquartered in Carman Hall, where many programs are produced including Bronx Talk and Open.

In 2012, Lehman dedicated its new $70 million Science Hall, a four-story building equipped with high-tech classrooms and laboratories, as well as a rooftop teaching and research greenhouse. In 2013, Science Hall was awarded a LEED platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council, the first CUNY building to earn the top green building rating. The structural engineers for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates (LERA).
The Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts is a professional theater which seats 2,310. The campus is also home to the Lehman College Art Gallery.

The Apex, Lehman College&#x27;s post-modern style athletic and fitness facility, opened in 1994. Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, the Apex stands in contrast to the original Gothic revival buildings that define the campus.

In 2024, Lehman opened a new building dedicated to Nursing. The $95 million building, designed by Urbahn Architects, is four stories high.

The New York City Subway&#x27;s Bedford Park Boulevard–Lehman College station is located near the campus and is named for the college.

==Students==
Students at Lehman College are from multiple ethnic and racial identities, multiple language backgrounds, various social classes, and diverse sexual orientations with many international students.

Enrollment (Fall 2018) Lehman College:
* Undergraduates: 12,639
* Graduate Students: 2,148
* Total: 14,787 students

==Academics==
Lehman College is organized into six schools, plus the Macaulay Honors College. Lehman College offers undergraduate and graduate programs in its Schools of Arts &amp; Humanities, School of Education, School of Natural and Social Sciences, School of Business, School of Health Sciences, Human Services, and Nursing, and School of Continuing Education.

===Macaulay Honors College at Lehman===
The highly selective Macaulay Honors College at Lehman provides a full tuition scholarship, Apple laptop computer, and opportunities fund of $7,500 that can be used for various activities such as study abroad, reimbursements for internships or research, and service learning. Students in the honors college are required to take 4 seminars relating to New York City, maintain a 3.5 grade point average, and graduate within four years. They also must take four Lehman Scholars Program Seminars, or &quot;LSP&quot;s.

===Lehman Scholars Program===
The Lehman Scholars Program is designed for capable and highly motivated students who have the desire and ability to pursue a somewhat more independent liberal arts course of study. The program includes special courses, seminars, and individual counseling. Students in the program are exempt from all of the normal degree requirements. They must, however, pass the CUNY Skills Assessment Tests to be admitted to the program and meet all course prerequisites and requirements for their major field.

===College Now===
The College Now program allows selected high school students to take college courses. The program is offered during the spring, summer and fall semesters and the courses are taught at the main Lehman campus.

===Freshman Year Initiative===
The Freshman Year Initiative is a program involving &quot;blocks&quot; of classes, similar to many high schools, which allows for new and first year students to get to know each other and become familiar with the college environment. All first-year students participate in the program, which promotes an interdisciplinary curriculum, faculty collaboration, and peer support. All students take mathematics and writing courses as well as a Freshman Seminar when they arrive to prepare them for the rest of their college courses.

==Research==

===The Jaime Lucero Mexican Studies Institute at CUNY===
The Jaime Lucero Mexican Studies Institute at CUNY includes faculty, students, staff, and community organizations focused on research, advocacy, and services related to Mexico and Mexicans in the U.S. Its goals are to create courses and programs across CUNY campuses, support Mexican and Mexican-American student success, host annual conferences and events on Mexican topics, and serve as a resource and hub for community-based organizations. The institute also provides internships, research assistantships, and service-learning opportunities for students with institutions serving New York City&#x27;s Mexican population.

===The Institute for Irish-American Studies===
The CUNY Institute for Irish-American Studies (IIAS): Located at Lehman College in the Bronx, New York, the IIAS is a research unit that supports scholars and students studying Irish and Irish American history, culture, and society. They offer public events, distance education courses, and publications.

==Athletics==

<text>Freelance (sometimes spelled free-lance or free lance), freelancer, or freelance worker, are terms commonly used for a person who is self-employed and not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work.

While the term &quot;independent contractor&quot; would be used in a to designate the tax and employment classes of this type of worker, the term &quot;freelancing&quot; is most common in culture and creative industries, and use of this term may indicate participation therein.

Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include: music, writing, acting, computer programming, web design, graphic design, translating and illustrating, film and video production, and other forms of piece work that some cultural theorists consider central to the cognitive-cultural economy.

==Freelance practices==

=== Types of work ===
According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report compiled primarily about North America freelancing, nearly half of freelancers do writing work, with 18% of freelancers listing writing as a primary skill, 10% editing/copy-editing, and 10% as copy-writing. 20% of freelancers listed their primary skills as design. Next on the list was translating (8%), web development (5.5%), and marketing (4%).

In 2018, freelancing was projected to grow to $20–$30 billion in the next 5–7 years in India, and the freelancers in the US will comprise 40% (approx.) of the workforce at the projected growth rate from the same time.

=== Compensation ===
Depending on the industry, freelance work practices vary and have changed over time. In some industries such as consulting, freelancers may require clients to sign written contracts. While in journalism or writing, freelancers may work for free or do work &quot;on spec&quot; to build their reputations or a relationship with a publication. Some freelancers may provide written estimates of work and request deposits from clients.

Payment for freelance work also depends on industry, skills, experience and location. Freelancers may charge by the day, hour, a piece rate, or on a per-project basis. Instead of a flat rate or fee, some freelancers have adopted a value-based pricing method based on the perceived value of the results to the client. By custom, payment arrangements may be upfront, percentage upfront, or upon completion. For more complex projects, a contract may set a payment schedule based on milestones or outcomes. One of the drawbacks of freelancing is that there is no guaranteed payment, and the work can be highly precarious. In order to ensure payment, many freelancers use online payment platforms to protect themselves or work with local clients that can be held accountable.

=== Copyright ===
The question of ownership of a work&#x27;s copyright arises when its author produces it on behalf of a client. The matter is governed by copyright law, which varies by country. The default ownership lies with the client in some countries and with the freelancing author in others. The degree to which either moral or economic ownership of a work for hire may be modified contractually varies by country.

==Demographics==

A 2018 McKinsey study found that up to 162 million people in Europe and the United States engage in some form of independent work. It represents 20–30 percent of the entire working age population.

The total number of freelancers in USA is inexact, as of 2013, the most recent governmental report on independent contractors was published in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. At that time, there were approximately 10.3 million United States workers (7.4% of the workforce) employed as independent contractors of all sorts. In 2011, Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist at George Mason University, estimated that number of freelancers had grown by one million. While in 2012, the Aberdeen Group, a private research company, estimated that 26% (approx. 81 million) of the United States population was a part of the contingent workforce, a category of casual labor that includes freelancing.

In 2013, the Freelancers Union estimated that 1 in 3 workers in the United States was self-employed (approximately 42 million), with more than four million (43%) of those self-employed workers as members of the creative class, a stratum of work specifically associated with freelance industries, such as knowledge workers, technologists, professional writers, artists, entertainers, and media workers.

In 2016, the Freelancers Union estimated that 35% of the workforce in the United States was self-employed (approximately 55 million). This workforce earned an estimated $1 trillion from freelancing in 2016—a significant share of the U.S. economy. In 2017, a study by MBO Partners estimated the total number of self-employed Americans aged 21 and above to be 40.9 million.

The total number of freelancers in UK is also inexact; however, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the proportion of remote workers rose from 9.2% in 2001 to 10.7% in 2011. It has been estimated, however, that there are approximately 1.7 million freelancers in the UK.

Freelancing is a gendered form of work. The 2012 Freelance Industry Report estimated that more than 71% of freelancers are women between the ages of 30 and 50. Surveys of other specific areas of freelancing have similar trends. Demographic research on Amazon Mechanical Turk revealed that the majority of its North American workers are women. Catherine McKercher&#x27;s research on journalism as a profession has showcased that while media organizations are still male-dominated, the reverse is true for freelance journalists and editors, whose ranks are mainly women.

==Benefits==
Freelancers have a variety of reasons for freelancing, the perceived benefits differ by gender, industry, and lifestyle. For instance, the 2012 Freelance Industry Report reported that men and women freelance for different reasons. Female survey respondents indicated that they prefer the scheduling freedom and flexibility that freelancing offers, while male survey respondents indicated they freelance to follow or pursue personal passions. Freelancing also enables people to obtain higher levels of employment in isolated communities. The ability to pick and choose who the freelancer works with is another benefit. The freelancer interviews a potential client and they get to pick whether or not to work with that individual or company.

Freelancing is also taken up by workers who have been laid-off, who cannot find full-time employment, or for those industries such as journalism which are relying increasingly on contingent labor rather than full-time staff. Freelancers also consist of students trying to make ends meet during the semester. In interviews, and on blogs about freelancing, freelancers list choice and flexibility as a benefit.

==Drawbacks==
Freelancing, like other forms of casual labor, can be precarious work. Websites, books, portals and organizations for freelancers often feature advice on getting and keeping a steady work stream. Beside the lack of job security, many freelancers also report the ongoing hassle of dealing with employers who don&#x27;t pay on time and the possibility of long periods without work. Additionally, freelancers do not receive employment benefits such as a pension, sick leave, paid holidays, bonuses or health insurance, which can be a serious hardship for freelancers residing in countries such as the US without universal health care.

Freelancers often earn less than their employed counterparts, although sometimes the opposite is true. While most freelancers have at least ten years of experience prior to working independently, experienced freelancers do not always earn an income equal to that of full-time employment. Feedback from members suggests that web portals such as Freelancer.com tend to attract low-paying clients that, although demanding very high standards, pay ~$10 per hour or less. Low-cost suppliers frequently offer to work at rates as low as $1–$2 per hour. Because most projects require bidding, professionals will not bid because they refuse to work at such rates. This has the effect of reducing the overall quality of the services provided.

According to research conducted in 2005 by the Professional Writers Association of Canada on Canadian journalists and editors, there is a wage gap between staff and freelance journalists. While the typical Canadian full-time freelancer is female, between 35 and 55, holding a college diploma and often a graduate degree, she typically earns about $29,999 Canadian dollars before taxes. Meanwhile, a staff journalist of similar age and experience level working full-time at outlets such as the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; or &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; newspapers, earned at least $63,500 Canadian dollars that year, the top scale rate negotiated by the union, The Newspaper Guild-Communications Workers of America. Given the gendered stratification of journalism, with more women working as freelancers than men, this disparity in income can be interpreted as a form of gender pay gap. The Professional Writers Association of Canada report showed no significant difference between the earnings of male and female freelancers, though part-time freelancers generally earned less than full-time freelancers.

Remote work is often cited as an attractive feature of freelancing, yet research suggests that it introduces new sets of constraints for the process of doing work, particularly for married women with families, who continue to bear the brunt of household chores and childcare despite increases in their paid work time. For instance, three years of ethnographic research about teleworkers in Australia conducted by Melissa Gregg, a Principal Engineer and Researcher in Residence for the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing at UC Irvine, raises concerns over how both physical isolation and continuous access enabled with networked digital media puts pressure on homeworkers to demonstrate their commitments through continual responses by email and to conceal their family or home life.

==Internet and online marketplaces==
The Internet has opened up many freelance opportunities, expanded available markets, and has contributed to service sector growth in many economies. Offshore outsourcing, online outsourcing and crowdsourcing are heavily reliant on the Internet to provide economical access to remote workers, and frequently leverage technology to manage workflow to and from the employer. Much computer freelance work is being outsourced to developing countries outside the United States and Europe. International freelancers use their skills in English to enable greater pay and flexibility in their work.

Freelance marketplaces provide a marketplace for freelancers and buyers. Service providers or sellers create a profile where they include a description of the services they offer, examples of their work, and, in some cases, information about their rates. Buyers register and complete a basic profile, and then post projects outlining their requirements. Buyers will then bid for these projects on a fixed price or hourly basis. Many of these websites have user review sections that affect the reputation of freelancers who list there, and which may be manipulated.

Freelance marketplaces have globalized competition for some jobs, allowing workers in high- and low-income countries to compete with one another. According to a 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute, 15% of independent workers used online marketplaces to find work.

These marketplaces, including Fiverr and Lyft, have been criticized as exploiting workers.

==Legal aspects==
Many periodicals and newspapers offer the option of ghost signing, when a freelance writer signs with an editor but their name is not listed on the byline of their article(s). This allows the writer to receive benefits while still being classified as a freelancer, and independent of any set organization. In some countries this can lead to taxation issues (e.g., so-called IR35 violations in the UK). Ghost signing has little bearing on whether a writer is a freelancer or employee in the US.

Freelancers often must handle contracts, legal issues, accounting, marketing, and other business functions by themselves. If they do choose to pay for professional services, they can sometimes turn into significant out-of-pocket expenses. Working hours can extend beyond the standard working day and working week.

The European Commission does not define &quot;freelancers&quot; in any legislative text. However, the European Commission defines a self-employed person as someone: &quot;pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law&quot;. In the exercise of such an activity, the personal element is of special importance and such exercise always involves a large measure of independence in the accomplishment of the professional activities. This definition comes from Directive (2010/41/EU) on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directive (2010/41/EU)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Forum of Independent Professionals defines freelancers as: &quot;a highly-skilled subset of self-employed workers, without employers nor employees, offering specialised services of an intellectual and knowledge-based nature&quot;. Independent professionals work on a flexible basis in a range of creative, managerial, scientific and technical occupations; they are not a homogeneous group and as such, they cannot be considered or investigated as a whole. They are generally characterised by a large portion of autonomy, a high labour productivity, knowledge intensive performance, social commitment and a large dose of entrepreneurship and specialisation.

In the U.S. in 2009, federal and state agencies began increasing their oversight of freelancers and other workers whom employers classify as independent contractors. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the Secretary of Labor have its Wage and Hour Division &quot;focus on misclassification of employees as independent contractors during targeted investigations.&quot; The increased regulation is meant to ensure workers are treated fairly and that companies are not misclassifying workers as independent contractors to avoid paying appropriate employment taxes and contributions to workers&#x27; compensation and unemployment compensation.

At the same time, this increased enforcement is affecting companies whose business models are based on using non-employee workers, as well as independent professionals who have chosen to work as independent contractors. For example, book publishing companies have traditionally outsourced certain tasks like indexing and proofreading to individuals working as independent contractors. Self-employed accountants and attorneys have traditionally hired out their services to accounting and law firms needing assistance. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service offers some guidance on what constitutes self-employment, but states have enacted stricter laws to address how independent contractors should be defined. For example, a Massachusetts law states that companies can hire independent contractors only to perform work that is &quot;outside the usual course of business of the employer,&quot; meaning workers working on the company&#x27;s core business must be classified as employees. According to this statute, a software engineering firm cannot outsource work to a software engineering consultant, without hiring the consultant as an employee. The firm could, however, hire an independent contractor working as an electrician, interior decorator, or painter. This raises questions about the common practice of consulting, because a company would typically hire a management consulting firm or self-employed consultant to address business-specific needs that are not &quot;outside the usual course of business of the employer.&quot;

=== United States ===
In the United States, where the federal constitution automatically grants ownership of the copyright only to the author, the contract agreement must explicitly use the language, that the product is &quot;work for hire&quot;, and that the copyright is transferred to the client. Otherwise, only the freelancer will own the right to reproduce the work. Registration of copyright is not required for ownership of these rights; however, litigation against infringement may require registration, as documented in the class action lawsuit, &quot;Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick&quot;. In that case, freelance writers sued publishers for copyright violations, though the case was eventually settled for the benefit of freelance writers whether or not they had registered their copyright with the Copyright Office. Copyright is rescinded only when a freelancer signs a contract specifying that they are &quot;working for hire,&quot; or if they are hired into employment. These rights are further specified in U.S. copyright law, Section 101 in the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USC §101).

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;freelancer&quot; is commonly attributed to Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832) in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820) to describe a &quot;medieval mercenary warrior&quot; or &quot;free-lance&quot; (indicating that the lance is not sworn to any lord&#x27;s services, not that the lance is available free of charge). It changed to a figurative noun around the 1860s and was recognized as a verb in 1903 by authorities in etymology such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary.&quot; Only in modern times has the term morphed from a noun (a freelance) into an adjective (a freelance journalist), a verb (a journalist who freelances) and an adverb (they worked freelance), as well as into the noun &quot;freelancer&quot;.

<text>Leo Allatius (Greek: Λέων Αλλάτιος, &quot;Leon Allatios&quot;, Λιωνής Αλάτζης, &quot;Lionis Allatzis&quot;; Italian: &quot;Leone Allacci, Allacio&quot;; Latin: &quot;Leo Allatius, Allacius&quot;; 1586 – January 1669) was a Greek scholar, theologian, and keeper of the Vatican library.

== Biography ==
Leo Allatius was a Greek, born on the island of Chios (then part of the Ottoman Empire and known as &quot;Sakız&quot;) in 1586. His father was Niccolas Allatzes (from Orthodox religion) and his mother was Sebaste Neurides, both of Greek extraction (Allatius soon converted himself to Catholicism from Greek Orthodoxy). He was taken by his maternal uncle Michael Nauridis to Italy to be educated at the age of nine, first in Calabria and then in Rome where he was admitted into the Greek college. A graduate of the Pontifical Greek College of Saint Athanasius in Rome, he spent his career in Rome as teacher of Greek at the Greek college, devoting himself to the study of classics and theology. He found a patron in Pope Gregory XV.

In 1622, after the capture of Heidelberg by Tilly, when the Protestant Elector of Bavaria Frederick V was supplanted by a Catholic one, the victorious elector Maximilian of Bavaria presented the Palatinate library composed of 196 cases containing about 3500 manuscripts to Pope Gregory. Allatius supervised its transport by a caravan of 200 mules across the Alps to Rome, where it was incorporated in the Vatican library. All but 39 of the Heidelberg manuscripts, which had been sent to Paris in 1797 and were returned to Heidelberg at the Peace of Paris in 1815, and a gift from Pope Pius VII of 852 others in 1816, remain in the Vatican Library to this day.

Allatius was &quot;passed over&quot; for the position of Vatican librarian and instead became librarian to Cardinal Lelio Biscia who had an extensive private library. On the Cardinal&#x27;s death, Allatius became librarian to Cardinal Francesco Barberini. Pope Alexander VII appointed him custodian of the Vatican Library in 1661, a post he held until his death.

His cultural background, embracing the Greek and Roman worlds, afforded him a unique view of the age-old question of union to heal the Great Schism. Better than any western scholar of his day he knew the religious, historical and artistic traditions of the Orthodox world, struggling under Ottoman domination. More passionately than any other 17th century theologian, he believed that familiarity with these traditions would enable the two churches to bridge their theological and ecclesiastical divide.

Thus in 1651, when he published the first printed edition of the works of George Acropolites, the 13th century emissary of the Byzantine Emperor who acknowledged the supremacy of the Roman pontiff and thus had become something of a celebrity, at least in the West, the Latin essay that formed the preface to this volume, &quot;De Georgiis eorumque Scriptis&quot;, gained fame itself as a learned plea for the commonalities between the two churches.

Allatius was a natural apologist for the Eastern communions in Eastern Europe, convinced as he was in himself that in the acts of union neither reasons of faith nor of doctrine were fundamental to the succession of the bishops, only a transfer of jurisdictions, and he seems really to have believed that the &quot;Latin faith&quot; and the &quot;Greek faith&quot; were identical and that under &quot;Roman obedience&quot; they could still be Orthodox. So he argued in his contribution to the mid-17th century Uniate pamphlet &quot;De Ecclesiae occidentalis atque orientalis perpetua consensione libri tres&quot; (&quot;The Western and Eastern Churches in perpetual Agreement, in Three Books&quot;) (1648). Such notions led to the final stipulations that the Eastern Churches were not to be merged with the Catholic Church but would retain their own hierarchical independence and traditional rituals.

Allatius was trained as a physician. In 1645 he included the first methodical discussion of vampires, in &quot;De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus&quot; (&quot;On certain modern opinions among the Greeks&quot;). In his later years he collected Greek and Syrian manuscripts to add to the late Pope Gregory XV&#x27;s Eastern Library at the Vatican.

A member of the Accademia degli Incogniti, he knew many of the figures who wrote Venetian operas. His &quot;Drammaturgia&quot; (1666), a catalogue of Italian musical dramas produced up to that year, is indispensable for the early history of opera. A new edition, carried down to 1755, appeared at Venice in that year.

His works are listed by Johann Albert Fabricius, in &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; (xi. 437), where they are divided into four classes:

*editions, translations and commentaries on ancient authors
*works relating to the dogmas and institutions of the Greek and Roman Churches
*historical works
*miscellaneous works.

His manuscripts (about 150 volumes) and his voluminous scholarly correspondence are held in the Biblioteca Vallicelliana (referred to by some sources as the &quot;Library of the Oratorians&quot;) in Rome. The number of his unpublished writings is very large; the majority of them are included in the manuscripts of the Vallicellian Library.

Allatius died in Rome on 18 (or 19) January 1669.

== In popular culture ==
Outside scholarly circles Allatius is perhaps best known today for his &quot;De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Foreskin of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;), a minor essay mentioned in Fabricius&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; (xiv. 17) as an unpublished work. According to an unconfirmed nineteenth-century source, its thesis is that the rings of Saturn (then-recently observed by telescope) are the prepuce of Jesus.

<text>The Fiat Panda is a city car manufactured and marketed by Fiat since 1980, currently in its third generation. The first generation Panda, introduced in 1980 as the Mk1, was a two-box, three-door hatchback designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and Aldo Mantovani of Italdesign and was manufactured through 2003 — receiving an all-wheel drive variant in 1983. SEAT of Spain marketed a variation of the first generation Panda under license to Fiat, initially as the &quot;Panda&quot; and subsequently as the Marbella (1986–1998).

The second-generation Panda, launched in 2003 as a 5-door hatchback, was designed by Giuliano Biasio of Bertone, and won the European Car of the Year in 2004. The third-generation Panda debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011, was designed at Fiat Centro Stilo under the direction of Roberto Giolito and remains in production in Italy at Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco. The fourth-generation Panda is marketed as Grande Panda, to differentiate it with the third-generation that is sold alongside it. Developed under Stellantis, the Grande Panda is produced in Serbia.

In 40 years, Panda production has reached over 7.8 million, of those, approximately 4.5 million were the first generation. Inearly 2020, its 23-year production was counted as the twenty-ninth most long-lived single generation car in history by &quot;Autocar&quot;. During its initial design phase, Italdesign referred to the car as &quot;il Zero&quot;. Fiat later proposed the name &quot;Rustica&quot;. Ultimately, the Panda was named after Empanda, the Roman goddess and patroness of travelers.


== First generation (1980)==

Introduced at the March 1980 Geneva Motor Show, the Panda was internally designated as Type 141 and was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and Aldo Mantovani of the newly formed Italdesign. From its inception, the Panda was designed as an inexpensive, easily maintained, utilitarian, and robustly simple car. Introduced to the press in December 1979; the first generation went on sale in Italy in late February, ahead of its Geneva première. Fiat launched right-hand drive models for the UK market in May 1981.

===Development===
As the first time Fiat had entrusted the development of a large-scale model to a firm outside the company, Giugiaro and Mantovani spent 15 days in the summer of 1976 in Porto Cervo, Sardinia designing the Panda — using the working name &quot;Zero&quot;. Giugiaro developed the packaging and styling; Mantovani conceived the car&#x27;s technical approach.

Fiat CEO Carlo De Benedetti&#x27;s design brief specified a straightforward &#x27;container&#x27; with a spacious and spartan interior, weighing and costing no more than the Fiat 126 it was replacing — and having a similar design approach as the Citroën 2CV or Renault 4. Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, Pierre Dreyfus, had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, &quot;which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretension of snobbism and social conformity.&quot;

During the design gestation, Giugiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture. To ensure its practicality, he conceived that the Panda&#x27;s cargo area should accommodate no less than two 50-liter wine demijohns, along with a full complement of passengers. From its inception, the project would use monocoque construction with a nearly flat floor and a sufficiently high roof to accommodate upright seating.

Giugiaro and Mantovani completed the design for its 7 August deadline, discovering only then that De Benedetti had left Fiat.

Despite De Benedetti&#x27;s departure, Italdesign presented Fiat with two full-scale models, four alternative side designs, an interior buck or mockup and a comprehensive study of the Panda&#x27;s competition — as well as a series of tempera renderings by Giugiaro. Under the prototyping designation &quot;Progetto 141,&quot; Fiat subsequently commissioned Italdesign to create production studies, a master model, provisional tooling and pre-production prototypes. Within a year, Italdesign had made 20 rolling chassis.

In February 1978, Fiat test-marketed prototypes to potential customers and dealers — at an unpublicized event in Milan&#x27;s Novegro Park. On response cards distributed by FIAT&#x27;s sales department, participants gauged the design&#x27;s exterior and interior appearance and finish, spaciousness, instruments and controls, engine size, price, and its provisional name: &quot;Rustica&quot;.

In January 1979, production was delayed by protracted union negotiations, specifically over Fiat&#x27;s plans to move production from plants in Cassino, Sulmona and Termini Imerese to Turin and Desio. An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.

On 26 February 1980 Fiat presented production models to President Sandro Pertini, in the gardens of Rome&#x27;s Quirinal Palace, and the car officially debuted in Geneva on 5 March — carrying the name &quot;Panda&quot;, after Empanda, the Roman goddess and patroness of travelers. At the time of its introduction, the World Wildlife Fund had resisted Fiat&#x27;s using the &quot;Panda&quot; name, but acquiesced when Fiat made a substantial financial contribution. As local custom allowed the writing of a check on any surface, Fiat delivered the contribution, written on the hood of an actual Panda.

In the two months following the Geneva Motor Show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders.

===Design===
Following the brief of creating a straightforward, practical design in the vein of the Citroën 2CV and the Renault 4, Italdesign&#x27;s work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda&#x27;s debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l&#x27;Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with Turinese newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;, published in February 1980:

One of the more noted design features was a highly flexible interior including a seven-position adjustable rear seat that could, via a series of adjustable lateral tubes, fold flat into a provisional bed, fold into a V shape to support awkward loads, or easily and quickly be removed altogether to increase the overall load space. Foregoing sprung upholstery, simple padded fabric seat covers, and fabric door trim could be removed and washed. Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket — accompanied by rigid plastic door storage pockets. A simple ashtray could slide along the support tube or be detached completely.

Cargo volume could accommodate 280 litres within the trunk area or could expand to 1000 litres with the rear seat removed — in either case unencumbered by the spare wheel, which was stored in the engine compartment. Exposed painted sheet metal comprised much of the interior&#x27;s exposed surfaces. The interior rear-view mirror had no day/night adjustment, and fresh air ventilation was oriented solely for demisting the windshield. The instrument cluster did contain an upper heating vent. Without fresh air venting to the interior via dash outlets, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.

Luigi Maglione, Fiat&#x27;s marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing. Fiat&#x27;s new CEO, Nicola Tufarelli clarified that the rustic interiors were in fact the final design, ready for launch.

With an overall aerodynamic coefficient lower than the Fiat 127&#x27;s, in spite of the blocky shape, the first Pandas featured a recess in the adjacent bodywork rather than door handles. It has completely flat glass in all windows — weighing less and making them inexpensive to manufacture, as well as easy to replace and interchangeable left to right. Fiat, in fact, had difficulty finding a manufacturer for the highly simplified glass. The engine bay was designed to accept either a transverse or longitudinal engine configuration: in practice, the simple sheet metal, body-colored, asymmetrical grille (derived during the design process by folding a piece of paper) was positioned either with its intake on the left for the air-cooled Panda 30 and on the right for the water-cooled Panda 45.

The bodyside panels were continuously welded to the roof panel and covered with a full-length black moulding — eliminating an expensive sheet metal fold, self-forming a rain gutter, and improving aerodynamics. Owing to the car&#x27;s flat sides, the lower section of the doors were corrugated to give them additional strength and to resist &quot;drumming&quot;. Much like earlier French counterparts, the Panda could be specified with a two-piece roll forward canvas roof. A scratch-resistant paint on the lowest portion of the side panels complemented resin, dent-resistant bumpers. In 2019, an example of the Panda 30 belonging to the FCA Heritage collection was exhibited at the Triennale di Milano.

===Launch model Mk1 (1980)===
Mechanically the first Pandas shared engines and transmissions with the Fiat 127 and, in certain territories, the air-cooled 652 cc two-cylinder powerplant of the Fiat 126. Rear suspension used a solid axle suspended on leaf springs. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.

Launch models included the Panda 30, powered by a longitudinally-mounted air cooled 652 cc straight-two-cylinder engine derived from the 126, and the Panda 45, with a transversely-mounted water cooled 903 cc (FIAT 100 series) four-cylinder from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the Panda 34 used an 843 cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the 850. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Fiat launched the Panda 45 Super at the Paris Motor Show later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the &quot;Comfort&quot; trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat&#x27;s revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.

The Panda 4x4 was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965 cc engine with derived from the Autobianchi A112 or Fiat 100 series engine. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system. The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. Austrian company Steyr-Puch supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece prop shaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell. In November 1984 trim levels were named &quot;L&quot;, &quot;CL&quot;, and &quot;S&quot;. Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.

===Mk2 (141a; 1986)===

In January 1986, the Panda received a complete change with visual, mechanical and chassis changes — with the majority of parts incompatible between the models. The Mk2 version was internally designated 141A.

The 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769 cc (34 PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999 cc (45 PS, 50 PS (37 kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat&#x27;s new FIRE family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the &quot;Omega axle&quot;, consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the Lancia Y10, which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up. The body was strengthened and fully-galvanised on later models, rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.


April 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301 cc diesel engine with . This was a detuned version of the Brazilian engine also used in the 127/Uno. Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic &quot;L&quot; trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).

A van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van eliminated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors —in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel was available in right-hand-drive markets.

In 1987, an entry-level model badged &quot;Panda Young&quot; was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769 cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod FIAT 100 engine and producing the same 34 bhp (25 kW) as the more sophisticated 769 cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, &quot;Sisley&quot; badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.

====Panda Italia 90====

FIAT was a major sponsor of the 1990 World Cup and the special edition &quot;Italia 90&quot; was sold in multiple European markets during the spring and summer of 1990. In the UK it was based on a standard white 750 cc Panda L, and included unique graphics (a green and red pin stripe creating the tricolour of the Italian flag  and the &quot;CIAO&quot; logo on the rear quarter panels), a custom interior fabric (Azzurri blue fabric with &quot;CIAO&quot; logos stitched on the back panels - the Italian football team wears blue), a tricolour shield motif on the grille and perhaps the most well known feature - the football hubcaps. Some European markets got solid white hubcaps instead. In Italy and Germany buyers were able to choose an Italia&#x27;90 based on a higher trim level which explains why some cars have rear wash wipe, later interiors with tipping front seats, and the option of a full canvas sunroof. The Fiat Style Centre and Carrozerria Maggiora also commissioned 40 convertible &quot;service cars&quot; for the Cup. The Agnelli family and Juventus gave one of these to each of the players who took part in the &quot;Nazionale&quot;, with the player&#x27;s name on the side. Twelve of the open-topped cars were driven onto the pitch at the start of each match in each of the stadiums hosting the matches.

====Panda Elettra====

The two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in early 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox — with weight increased to ( over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes. Range was limited, at at a steady . In city driving, the range dropped to . Top speed was a mere . A full charge took 8 hours using a standard household outlet.

1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda. This, limited range and speed, and the steep price (25.600.000 lire in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. Nickel–cadmium batteries would have made the car lighter and improved performance and range, but would have increased the price even more. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.

=== Second facelift (1991)===
1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the &#x27;Selecta&#x27;, which had a continuously variable transmission with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999 cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a catalytic converter) or an all-new 1108 cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing .


The new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769 cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769 cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903 cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999 cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108 cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999 cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.

In 1992, the 1108 cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999 cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50 bhp) and also in 1992 an 899 cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the &#x27;Cafe&#x27; special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903 cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.

In January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899 cc was discontinued and only the Euro 3 capable, fuel-injected 1108 cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.

====End of production====
The Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995. The car remained in production in Italy until the final car was produced on 5 September 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe&#x27;s longest-produced small cars. 

===SEAT Panda / Marbella===

Spanish car maker SEAT also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called SEAT Panda. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.

Up to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a licence agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When Pope John Paul II visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.

After Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars was quickly given minor facelifts. The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers, and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed, SEAT Terra.

As Fiat and SEAT&#x27;s licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old pushrod Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame, and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was the firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.

===Reception and awards===
The first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 European Car of the Year awards in its first full year of production (pipped to first place by the Ford Escort Mark III) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.

In 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian Compasso d&#x27;Oro ADI industrial design award for the Panda.
A less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as &quot;the most enchanting work of his life&quot;, and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as &quot;proud overall of the car&#x27;s architecture&quot; to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper, who likened the car to &quot;a shoe box&quot;. In several key markets the Panda&#x27;s styling would continue to attract mixed reactions as the Uno followed in 1983 and the aggressively boxy look became the house style for Fiats throughout the 1980s.

==Second generation (2003)==


The second generation Mk3 Panda, codenamed &quot;Model 169&quot;, debuted in 2003, with almost no direct engineering linkage to the first generation. Until July 31, 2003, the vehicle name was meant to be Fiat Gingo. After a request from Renault because Gingo sounded too similar to the name of its own small car, the Twingo, Fiat eventually changed the name of its city car. In 2004, the new Panda was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro industrial design award. Production model development was entrusted to I.DE.A Institute.

Like the smaller Fiat Seicento, the Panda was manufactured only in Tychy, Poland, by Fiat Auto Poland.

The high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from mini MPVs and mini SUVs, especially the second generation Fiat Multipla. The Panda won the European Car of the Year award in 2004.

The Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with ABS, EBD and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.

Financially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the Fiat 500 than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.
* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre diesel engine.
* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.
* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre diesel engine.
* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75 bhp Multijet diesel engine.

Top Gear Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received. (One of the show&#x27;s hosts, James May, went on to purchase one).

===Official usage===
The Panda is produced for police departments (the Polish police have bought some blue and white Panda Actual models), military agencies (the Italian Army uses several dark green Panda Climbing models), forest services (the Italian forest service has dark green Panda Climbing models), and mail delivery services (the yellow Swiss Post model even comes in a popular toy car format readily available in grocery stores).

===Safety (2004)===
Tested model: 2004 Fiat Panda 1.2.
===2005 revisions===
In September 2005 several changes were made to the Panda, including standard fitment of ABS and a front passenger&#x27;s airbag.

===2007 revisions===
The Panda range received minor updates in March 2007, including a new, darker dashboard. The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.

===2009 revisions===
The Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO2 emissions. Both models also qualify for £30 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.

On 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75 hp 1.3 L Multijet four-cylinder diesel. Fiat did not say which country it was headed to.

===Panda Classic===
The Panda Classic was a second series Fiat Panda renamed and with a reduced list price to distinguish it from the new generation introduced in late 2011. The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.

===Models===
* The Natural Power is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240 km of autonomy on gas only.
* The basic Actual has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.
* The Active, introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, radio/cassette player, driver&#x27;s airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger&#x27;s airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100 cc &quot;FIRE&quot; engine and a five-speed gearbox.
* The Active Plus edition is an up-equipped &quot;Active&quot;, with a cassette/CD player as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.
* The Dynamic edition features ABS, dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a cassette player as standard. A CD &amp; MP3 player, CD changer, alloy wheels, manual or automated climate control, glass sunroof, and an automated manual transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four airbags have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional side curtain airbags.
* The Emotion (Eleganza) edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated climate control. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the &quot;Eleganza&quot;.
* The 100 HP edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve FIRE petrol from the Fiat Punto tuned to develop through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100 HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.

The Panda 100 hp offers 0–100 km/h acceleration in 9.5 s and a maximum speed of , with fuel consumption at in the EU combined cycle and 154 g/km of CO2 emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a &quot;Pandamonium Pack&quot; which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.

The Panda 100 hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.
* The 4x4 Climbing edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The four-wheel drive system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a &quot;Climbing&quot; badge just below the &quot;Panda&quot; badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bilägare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.
* The Cross edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in Italy and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.

The Actual and Active are also bases for the Actual Van and Active Van, which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small &quot;Van&quot; label on the back door.

During the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.

===Prototypes and special editions===
* The 360 Special Series
Based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, the 360 Special Series is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14 inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of £1,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly £400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.
* Fiat Panda Alessi

Italian design house Alessi created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi&#x27;s products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model&#x27;s debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the &quot;Girotondo&quot; family accents.
* Fiat Panda Jolly
The Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as &quot;a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials&quot;, the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.

The interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.
* Fiat Panda Terramare 4
Panda Terramare&#x27;s creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former Iso Rivolta engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.

On 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the English Channel from Folkestone in Kent to Cap Gris Nez in just over 6 hours.
* Fiat Panda Luxury
At the &#x27;Luxury &amp; Yachts&#x27; show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the &#x27;Luxury&#x27;. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.
* Fiat Panda Hydrogen

The Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research &amp; Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.

On the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.

At full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than , with acceleration from 0 to in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.

During 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.
* Fiat Panda Tanker

Unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.
Rugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian extreme sport clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.

Reflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.
* Fiat Panda MultiEco
The Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.

The show-car combines an innovative &#x27;powertrain&#x27; architecture – an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device – with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.

Panda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine – future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix – combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.
* Fiat PanDAKAR
Two factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling Dakar 2007 rally raid, which started in Lisbon.

Entered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by Miki Biasion and former Dakar winner, Bruno Saby, respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto&#x27;s 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver at 4,500 rpm and a peak torque of . at 2,500 rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.

The two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.

Both PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.
* Fiat Panda Simba

The Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year&#x27;s production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production Cross model.
* Fiat Panda Aria

Fiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km CO2. With 900 cc turbocharged straight-2 engine it produces , it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.

This new engine is equipped with Fiat&#x27;s Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing . The car is also equipped with Stop&amp;Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.

===Engines===
The smallest engine, the 1.1 L petrol SOHC FIRE engine, rated at is also found in the Fiat Seicento. This engine was originally developed and launched in the mid-1980s.

The 1.2-litre (actually 1,242 cc), engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.

The 1.3-litre Multijet diesel engine is rated at and of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the Punto (where it develops of torque) due to the Panda&#x27;s weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a &quot;Multijet&quot; badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.

Introduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368 cc FIRE engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This FIRE engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.

The engine is undersquare with bore and stroke of respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.

===Chinese copy lawsuit===
In December 2006, Fiat considered taking legal action against Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor for the company&#x27;s Peri, which is a copy of the Panda&#x27;s design.

In July 2008, Fiat successfully sued Great Wall and had the Peri banned from importation into Europe. In addition, the court order ruled for Great Wall to pay Fiat a 15,000 euro fine for the first Peri imported, and an additional 50,000 euros for every subsequent car that was imported.

In October 2009, Great Wall Motor sued Fiat, accusing the latter of espionage. In the lawsuit, Great Wall claims that &quot;Fiat once instigated espionage to prowl into its research center and take photos of Peri small car that was still under developed.&quot;

===Production figures===
== Third generation (2011)==
Fiat presented the third generation of the Panda at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011. The new architecture is based on the Fiat Mini platform. The production began in the renewed Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco Plant in the last quarter of 2011.

The previous model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat&#x27;s plants in Italy.

===Models===
====Panda Natural Power====
The Natural Power is the CNG/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda. Unlike the previous generation – which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 &quot;FIRE&quot; inline four – it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder &quot;TwinAir&quot; engine. The system is developed in-house and factory installed.

The CNG is stored in two – one 22 L and one 50 L – gas cylinders: the former housed longitudinally in the transmission tunnel, the latter transversally behind the rear axle. Due to the cylinders being both located under the floorpan, the boot&#x27;s volume is reduced only by 25 liters – 200 L instead of the monofuel&#x27;s 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40 mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal silencer – thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.

Total bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters – or 12 kilograms – of CNG and 35 L of petrol – two liters less than the monofuel&#x27;s 37.
At startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver&#x27;s demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.

Due to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power &quot;TwinAir&quot; engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG – although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.

====Panda EasyPower====
The EasyPower is the LPG/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.
Its 1.2 &quot;FIRE&quot; inline four develops 69 PS.

====Panda Trekking====
Launched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel-drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no &quot;4x4&quot; inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.

Available on this model are the 0.9 &quot;TwinAir&quot; turbocharged petrol and 1.3 &quot;Multijet II&quot; turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the &quot;Traction +&quot; ESC-based electronically simulated front locking differential and the standard M+S tires, along with the &quot;TwinAir Natural Power&quot; turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.

The Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.

====Panda 4x4====

The third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The engine lineup includes the &quot;TwinAir&quot; turbocharged petrol engine and &quot;Multijet II&quot; turbodiesel. The TwinAir engine is linked to a six-speed transmission with a short ratio first gear and the Diesel is linked to a 5-speed transmission.

The Panda 4x4 receives model specific bumpers with extra cladding, body side moldings, plastic wheelarch extensions and 175/65 M+S tires on 15&quot; dark grey alloy wheels. The full-time all wheel drive system is composed by two open differentials front and rear and a rear-mounted electronically controlled coupling, which sends torque to the two axles in proportion depending on road conditions.
At the rear is a specially developed torsion beam semi-independent suspension, a change from the previous generation&#x27;s trailing arms.

An electronically simulated locking differential (termed &quot;ELD&quot;, &quot;Electronic Locking Differential&quot;) supplements the open-type differentials. The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.

All 4x4 models were discontinued in May 2022 because of components shortages, but Fiat reportedly hopes to bring back the 4x4 option in 2023.

====Panda Cross / City Cross====
Launched at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, it is the range-topping, offroad-styled Panda. Mechanically it is based on the Panda 4x4, offering the same choice of powertrains.
As in the previous generation the Cross is recognizable by its wider 185/65 tyres on specific alloy wheels, new fascias with prominent skid plates and unique broken up head- and taillights arrangement. The new bumpers, together with an increased ground clearance, give the car better approach and departure angles.

From 2017, a 4x2 Fiat Panda Cross is offered under the name Fiat City Cross.

In 2020, the Fiat Panda Cross and Fiat Panda City Cross changed names on the French market. Both models lost the &quot;Panda&quot; name: the Fiat Panda City Cross became the Fiat City Cross, and the Fiat Panda Cross became the Fiat City Cross 4x4. For other markets, this change did not occur. Late 2022, the name of the vehicle was changed again in France, as the Fiat City Cross became the Fiat Panda Cross (meaning Fiat France reused the original name of the Panda Cross 4x4 model to now designate the Panda Cross 4x2 model).

In late 2022, as all Fiat Panda 4x4 models have been discontinued, Fiat renamed the Fiat Panda City Cross (Fiat City Cross in France) as Fiat Panda Cross in all markets. In other words, the brand reused the original name of the Panda Cross 4x4 model to now designate the Panda Cross 4x2 model.

====Panda Hybrid====
In 2020, Fiat updated the Panda with mild-hybrid technology. It&#x27;s a combination of a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder FireFly petrol engine, a 12-volt BSG (Belt-integrated Starter Generator) electric motor and an 11 Ah lithium-ion battery. Panda mild-hybrid mounts a KERS system.

====Pandina====

In February 2024, Fiat announced a new special version of the Panda that would go by the name Pandina, to be available from summer 2024. The name Pandina is a tribute to the nickname that the Panda has in Italy, Pandina meaning &#x27;little Panda&#x27;. The Pandina is based on the Cross model, and features a number of driver assistance systems to comply with the latest &quot;GSR2&quot; EU standards: advanced emergency braking system, lane keeping assist, drowsy driver detection, traffic sign recognition, rear parking sensors, cruise control and automatic high beam. The interior gains a 7-inch digital instrument panel and a 7-inch central entertainment screen. Mechanically the Pandina is identical to the Panda Hybrid.

In Europe, Fiat is offering the Pandina in only 10 countries: Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Spain and Portugal.

===Special editions===
====Panda 4x4 Steyr====
Austrian market only special edition, announced in 2012. Its Steyr Tractor theme celebrates the several collaborations throughout the years between Fiat and former Steyr-Daimler-Puch, such as the development of the original Panda&#x27;s four-wheel-drive system.
Built on the basis of the Panda 4x4 1.3 &quot;Multijet II&quot; with richer interior standard equipment, it was available in red or white with contrasting colour side stripes and Steyr logo decals.

====Panda 4x4 Antarctica====
This limited, 200 cars edition was premiered at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Panda 4x4.
It was too based on the Panda 4x4 1.3 &quot;Multijet II&quot;, featuring several normally extra cost options like automatic climate control, parking sensors and Blue&amp;Me Bluetooth connectivity as standard. The exterior was characterized by a white with black roof two-tone paint scheme accented by orange wheel centers and side mirror caps.

====Panda 4×40°====

Unveiled in June 2023, the Fiat Panda 4×40° is based on the 4×4 version, being produced in 1,983 units and available only in Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland.
===Safety===
The third-generation Panda was tested by Euro NCAP towards the end of 2011, and achieved a four-star result. One star was dropped mainly because the Panda&#x27;s electronic stability control wasn&#x27;t available on all trim levels, such as one of the tested cars. Fiat clarified on the same day that ESC would be offered on the entire Fiat Panda range in the first months of 2012. It was retested in 2018 to a 0 star result as the protocol had evolved but not the car.

====Collision avoidance system====

Fiat&#x27;s &quot;City Brake Control&quot; low-speed crash avoidance system is available as optional on the Panda. The system works by readying and if necessary automatically executing an emergency stop whenever an imminent collision is detected by its laser sensor. In 2013, City Brake Control attained the Euro NCAP Advanced reward.

===Records===
At 5:28pm on Monday 11 February 2013, Philip Young and Paul Brace broke the world record drive, in either direction, from Cape Town in South Africa to London in Great Britain with a Fiat Panda two-cylinder 0.9 TwinAir. The drive started on 1 February and ended 10 days, 13 hours and 28 minutes later, shaving over a day off the previous record, achieved in 2010 by a Land Rover Defender, and a further 4 seconds off the Cape Town to London record, set in 1983.

===Awards===
* Panda 4x4: Top Gear Magazine&#x27;s &quot;SUV of the Year 2012&quot;.
* Panda TwinAir Turbo Natural Power: &quot;Das grünste Auto der Schweiz 2013&quot; (&quot;Greenest car in Switzerland&quot;), part of Swiss Car of the Year 2013.

===Engines===
== Fourth generation (2024) ==

The fourth-generation (Mk5) Panda was introduced on 14 June 2024, with the interior and full specifications was later revealed on 11 July coincided with Fiat’s 125th anniversary &quot;Smiling to the Future” ceremony. It is marketed as the Grande Panda, based on the Smart Car platform shared with the fourth-generation Citroën C3 and Opel Frontera. It will be sold with mild hybrid and electric powertrains. The Grande Panda will be sold alongside the third-generation Panda, the latter will continue production in Italy until at least 2030.

<text>This list of longest films is composed of films with a running time of 300 minutes (5 hours) or more. 

==Cinematic films==
Note: Some releases are extended cuts or director&#x27;s cuts, and are ranked according to the longest verified running time.
==Experimental films==

While most cinematic films have a broad theatrical release in multiple locations through normal distribution channels, some of the longest films are experimental in nature or created for art gallery installations, having never been simultaneously released to multiple screens or intended for mainstream audiences. They may have been shown in venues where audiences were only expected to view a portion of the film during its screening.
==Films released in separate parts==
This section lists films conceived as an artistic unity and produced simultaneously, or consecutively with no significant interruption or change of production team, even though they were released with separate premières.

<doc id="484046" wikidata="Q808621" url="?curid=484046" title="Baron Haden-Guest">
<text>Baron Haden-Guest, of Saling in the County of Essex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 2 February 1950 for the Labour Party politician Leslie Haden-Guest. He had previously represented Southwark North and Islington North in the House of Commons. His fourth son, the fourth Baron (who succeeded his half-brother in 1987, who in his turn had succeeded his brother in 1974), was a United Nations official for many years.

The title is held by his son Christopher Guest, the fifth Baron, who succeeded him in 1996. Christopher Guest is a film director, writer, actor and musician, married to the actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who is therefore the current Lady Haden-Guest.

==Barons Haden-Guest (1950)==
*Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest (1877–1960)
*Stephen Haden Haden-Guest, 2nd Baron Haden-Guest (1902–1974)
*Richard Haden Haden-Guest, 3rd Baron Haden-Guest (1904–1987)
*Peter Albert Michael Haden-Guest, 4th Baron Haden-Guest (1913–1996)
*Christopher Haden-Guest, 5th Baron Haden-Guest (born 1948)

Anthony Haden-Guest, the current baron&#x27;s older half-brother, was born out of wedlock, and hence is not in the line of succession. As the current baron has no sons, the heir presumptive is his brother, the Hon. Nicholas Haden-Guest (born 1951). There are no more heirs to the barony.

<text>The Volkswagen Lupo (&quot;Typ&quot; 6X) is a city car that was produced by the German car manufacturer Volkswagen, from 1998 to 2005.

The Lupo name is Latin, meaning wolf, and is named after its home town of Wolfsburg.

The Lupo was introduced in October 1998, to fill the void at the bottom of the Volkswagen model range caused by the increasing size and weight of the Polo. The right-hand-drive version for the UK market was launched in the spring of 1999. In Japan, two models with petrol 4-valve 1.4L and 4-speed automatic with lock-up on the 4th were launched on 11 July 2001.

Lupo uses the A00 platform which is a shortened version of the Polo/Ibiza A0 platform. Initially only available in two trim variants, the budget &quot;E&quot; trim and the upgraded S trim; the range later expanded to include a Sport and GTI variant.

Petrol engines ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 (1.6 for the GTI) with diesels from 1.2 to 1.7. The differences between the E and S trim included painted door mirrors, door handles and strip, central locking, electric windows, double folding seats and opening rear windows. The Sport also got a chrome centre exhaust and front foglights as standard. 

The Lupo was designed by Jozef Kabaň.

===Replacement===
Sales of the Lupo were slow and missed Volkswagen&#x27;s targets. In 2001 a Volkswagen source claimed that it was decided the Lupo would eventually be discontinued and replaced by a model built in China.

Production of the Lupo was discontinued in June 2005, and was replaced on the European market by the Brazilian designed Fox. Due to the decision taken by Volkswagen, to use the Fox instead of developing any genuine replacement for the Lupo. 
 The Lupo&#x27;s spiritual successor, Volkswagen up!, was released in 2011.

===Lupo 3L===
The Volkswagen Lupo 3L (&quot;Typ 6E&quot;) was a special edition made with the intent of being the world&#x27;s first car in series production consuming as little as 3 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres (78 miles per US gallon or 94 miles per Imperial gallon). To achieve this, the 3L was significantly changed from the standard Lupo to include:

* 1.2 litre three cylinder diesel engine with turbocharger and direct injection 
* Use of light weight aluminum and magnesium alloys for doors, bonnet (hood), rear hatch, seat frames, engine block, wheels, suspension system etc. to achieve a weight of only 
* Tiptronic gearbox
* Engine start/stop automatic to avoid long idling periods
* Low rolling resistance tires
* Automated manual transmission and clutch, to optimise fuel consumption, with a Tiptronic mode for the gearbox
* Changed aerodynamics, so a formula_1 value of 0.29 was achieved

The 3L, along with the GTI and FSI, had a completely different steel body to other Lupos, using thinner but stronger steel sheet. The car had an automated manual transmission with a Tiptronic mode on the selector and electro-hydraulic actuation system for the clutch and shifting. The car also had an ECO mode. When engaged it limited the power to 41 bhp (31 kW; 42 PS) (excluding kick down) and programmed the transmission to change up at the most economical point.

ECO mode also activated the start/stop function, a feature that was new to European cars at the time.

To restart, the driver simply takes his foot off the brake and presses the accelerator. In ECO mode, the clutch was disengaged when the accelerator pedal was released for maximum economy, so the car freewheels as much as possible, with the clutch re engaging as soon as the accelerator pedal or brake pedal is touched. The 3L also has only four-wheel bolts and alloy brake drums at the rear, along with many aluminium suspension components.

Initially, there were very few options on the 3L, as options added weight which affected fuel consumption. Those available initially were electrically heated and electrically controlled mirrors, fog lights, and different paint colours. In order to increase sales, other options were offered, including all electric steering, electric windows, and air conditioning.

These options, however, increased fuel consumption slightly. In July 2001, a Japanese economy driver, Dr. Miyano, used it to set a new world record for the most frugal circumnavigation of Britain in a standard diesel production car, with an average fuel economy figure of 119.48 mpg or 2.36 L/100 km.

In November 2003, Gerhard Plattner covered a distance of 2,910 miles through twenty European countries in a standard Lupo 3L TDI. He achieved his aim of completing this journey, which started in Oslo, Norway, and finished in The Hague in the Netherlands, with just €100 worth of fuel. In fact, all he required was 90.94 euros, which corresponds to an average consumption of 2.78 litres per 100 km (101.6 mpg).

The Lupo 3L shared its engine and special gearbox with the Audi A2 1.2 TDI 3L. As a result of this and other changes, this Audi A2 is also capable of reaching the same results as the Lupo 3L. According to the instruction manual of the Lupo 3L, the 3L engine also runs on Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) without any changes to the engine.

During the period of series production of the Lupo 3L, Volkswagen also presented the 1L Concept, a prototype made with the objective of proving the capability of producing a roadworthy vehicle consuming only 1 litre of fuel per 100 kilometres (235 miles per US gallon).

=== Lupo Sport ===
The Lupo Sport was available with the petrol 1.4 and the diesel 1.4 . 

There are a number of visual and mechanical differences compared to the lower trim levels. Sports had 14&quot; Kyalami Alloys, front fog lamps, ABS (an option on diesels up to 2003), heated windscreen washer jets, and electric mirrors on later models. The petrol also had a central single exhaust and rear disc brakes. Early Sports came with &quot;Tim &amp; Tom&quot; upholstery which was brightly coloured with cartoon cats and mice on, this was later changed to interwoven velour with sportier seats from the GTI.

The 1.4 petrol also differed from the one equipped in the S trim with different ECU, inlet cam, gear ratios, exhaust manifold, metal inlet manifold, bigger and drive-by-wire throttle body (instead of cable), bigger 256mm front disc brakes (vs 239mm).

===Lupo FSi===
The Lupo FSi was the first direct injection petrol powered production vehicle Volkswagen produced. A 5L/100 km 1.4 16v petrol version of the Lupo 3L with an average consumption of 4.9L/100 km. This direct injection engine next to a conventional engine with similar power uses around 30% less fuel. It had a similar automated gearbox to the 3L but with different gear ratios.

Outwardly, it was almost identical to a 3L but with a different front grill, slightly wider wheels with a different design and lacked the magnesium steering wheel and rear bumper of the 3L. Early 3L and FSi models had aluminium tailgates which were lighter and more aerodynamic than their standard Lupo counterparts. Early FSi models also had a unique spoiler while later ones without the aluminium tailgates were fitted with the same spoiler as the Lupo GTI. The FSi was only sold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

===Lupo GTI===

The 1.6 L Lupo GTI, introduced in the year 2000, has been labelled a true successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, one of the first true hot hatches. The GTI can be identified by its fully body coloured bumpers and twin central exhausts. In March 2002, a six speed gearbox was added, together with improved throttle response, and was suggested as a competitor to the Mini Cooper, or the larger Volkswagen Polo GTI.

The GTI features much more standard equipment which was not available on any other in the Lupo range, including bi-xenon headlights, 15 inch Bathurst alloy wheels and an off black interior. With a DOHC sixteen valve four cylinder engine producing , the GTI had a top speed of and could accelerate 0 to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds.

==Production figures==
More than 480,000 units of the Volkswagen Lupo have been produced through its lifetime.

The total production per year of the Lupo is shown below:

<text>&quot;Spain&quot; is an instrumental jazz fusion composition by jazz pianist and composer Chick Corea. It is likely Corea&#x27;s most recognized piece, and is considered a jazz standard.

&quot;Spain&quot; was composed in 1971 and appeared in its original (and best-known) rendition on the album &quot;Light as a Feather&quot;, with performances by Corea (Rhodes electric piano), Airto Moreira (drums), Flora Purim (vocals and percussion), Stanley Clarke (bass), and Joe Farrell (flute). It has been recorded in several versions, by Corea himself as well as by other artists, including a flamenco version by Paco de Lucía, Al Di Meola and John McLaughlin in the 1980s, and a progressive bluegrass version by Béla Fleck in 1979. 
A version with lyrics by Al Jarreau, &quot;Spain (I Can Recall)&quot;, appeared on the 1980 album &quot;This Time&quot;. More recently, Corea had performed his composition as a duo with Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara. A version of &quot;Spain&quot; was performed by Stevie Wonder at his 2008 Concert in London. The introduction used in the song is from Concierto de Aranjuez, a guitar concerto by the Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo.

The &quot;Light as a Feather&quot; version of &quot;Spain&quot; received two Grammy nominations, for Best Instrumental Arrangement and for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Group. In 2001, Corea was awarded the Best Instrumental Arrangement Grammy for &quot;Spain for Sextet and Orchestra&quot;.

==Composition==

Corea opens the &quot;Light as a Feather&quot; version of &quot;Spain&quot; with the adagio from Joaquin Rodrigo&#x27;s &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot;. 

Corea took inspiration from Spanish flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia for this piece.

After the intro, the song switches to a fast, steady samba-like rhythm, in which the main theme and an improvisation part are repeated.

The chord progression used during the improvisation part is based on harmonic progressions in Rodrigo&#x27;s concerto. It runs as follows:

 | Gmaj7 | F#7 | Em7 A7 | Dmaj7 (Gmaj7) | C#7 F#7 | Bm B7 |

<doc id="484053" wikidata="Q423236" url="?curid=484053" title="Rodrigo Valdez">
<text>Rodrigo Valdez (February 22, 1946 – March 15, 2017) was a Colombian professional boxer who competed from 1963 to 1980. He was a two time middleweight champion, having held the WBC title from 1974 to 1976 and the undisputed WBA, WBC, and &quot;The Ring&quot; titles from 1977 to 1978. His rivalry with Carlos Monzón has long been considered among the most legendary boxing rivalries. Valdez was trained by International Boxing Hall of Fame coach Gil Clancy. Many people consider him, Antonio Cervantes and Miguel &quot;Happy&quot; Lora to be the three greatest boxers ever to come from that country. He is 29th on Ring Magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

==Professional boxing career==
Born in Bolívar, Colombia, Rodrigo Valdez began his professional boxing career with a win over Orlando Pineda in a four-round decision on October 25, 1963, at Cartagena. He won his next eight bouts, but on October 2, 1965, he lost his undefeated record, beaten by knockout in six by Rudy Escobar.

After that defeat, he went on another undefeated streak of fifteen fights, of which he won thirteen and tied two. However, on his first fight abroad, February 16, 1969, in Ecuador, he lost a ten-round decision to Daniel Guanin. After one more fight in Cartagena, he moved to the United States. Trying to gain more recognition, he campaigned, from 1969 to 1970, in the states of New York, Nevada and California, winning seven fights and losing two. Then, he returned to South America for four more fights in his homeland, winning all.

===Hepatitis===
In his next match, held at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, with Bobby Cassidy on August 9, 1971, Valdez won by knockout in round six, because the fight doctor deemed Cassidy not fit to continue from a cut around his eye which had been ruled as produced by a Valdez punch. At the time, nobody knew that Cassidy had hepatitis A. As a consequence of this, Valdez also became affected by the disease. Given a quarantine, he refused to quit boxing periodically and continued training during his time of illness. Separated from most of the world, he was fit enough to win two more fights within three months of his initial diagnosis of hepatitis.

Valdez had nineteen wins in a row when he met Philadelphia legend Bennie Briscoe for the NABF middleweight title, in Nouméa, New Caledonia, on September 1, 1973, beating Briscoe in a 12-round decision to capture the regional championship and becoming a world-ranked middleweight contender. After this win, Valdez claimed for a world title shot at Monzon.

===World title===
He won two more fights, and the WBC made him its number one contender at Monzon&#x27;s title. But Monzon did not feel like fighting the Colombian at that moment, so the WBC stripped Monzon of the world title (Monzon retained the WBA title) and made Valdez and Briscoe rematch, this time with the WBC world middleweight title on the line. On May 25, 1974, at Monte Carlo, Valdez became a world champion for the first time, by knocking Briscoe out in seven rounds. Valdez subsequently retained his title against Rudy Valdez, Gratien Tonna, and Max Cohen, until Monzon finally agreed to meet him.

One week before the long-awaited match-up, on June 19, 1976, Valdez&#x27;s brother was murdered during a barroom fight in Colombia. Already in Monte Carlo for the fight, Valdez wanted to pull out of it to join his family in mourning. But he was contractually bound to fight Monzon, so he had to stay in Europe, and on June 26, Valdez, who to many observers seemed rather uninterested, lost in the unification bout to Monzon in a 15-round unanimous decision. Valdez won two more fights after returning to Colombia.

The WBA and WBC, recognizing that Valdez probably wasn&#x27;t in the best of moods to fight during his first confrontation with Monzon, ordered a second fight between the rivals, and so they fought again, on July 30, 1977, once again at Monte Carlo. This time around, Valdez knocked down Monzon in the second round, becoming the only man to send the Argentine to the floor in Monzon&#x27;s long career. Valdez was leading after seven rounds, but Monzon mounted a late rally that allowed him to keep the title by a close decision.

===Monzon&#x27;s retirement===
Monzon announced his retirement from boxing afterwards, and so Valdez and Briscoe were matched once again, on November 5, 1977, for the vacant undisputed world middleweight championship, in Campione d&#x27;Italia, which belonged back then not to Italy, but actually to Switzerland. Valdez recovered the world middleweight championship, with a 15-round decision over Briscoe. This time around, however, he would lose his title on his first defense, on April 22, 1978, by points in 15 rounds to another Argentine, Hugo Corro, in San Remo, Italy.

On November 11 of that same year, they had a rematch, at Buenos Aires&#x27; Luna Park Stadium, and Corro repeated his 15-round victory to retain the world title.

==Retirement==
Valdez fought only twice more, winning both fights by knockout. After beating Gilberto Amonte on November 28, 1980, in the first round, he retired from boxing for good.

Valdez had a record of 63 wins, eight losses and two draws as a professional boxer, with 42 wins by knockout.

==Death==
According to Colombian sources, Valdez died of a massive heart attack on March 14, 2017. Cartagena mayor Manuel Duque confirmed the two time former world champion&#x27;s death, calling him &quot;one of the greatest Colombian sportsmen of all time&quot;.

<doc id="484059" wikidata="Q945464" url="?curid=484059" title="Look Sharp! (Roxette album)">
<text>Look Sharp! is the second studio album by Swedish pop rock duo Roxette, released on 21 October 1988 by EMI, two years after their debut &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; (1986). It was recorded at EMI Studios in Stockholm and at Trident II Studios in London between March and September 1988. The album was an immediate commercial success in Sweden, debuting at number one and eventually being certified 6× platinum there.

Although commercial success elsewhere was initially modest, the album was the duo&#x27;s international breakthrough. It went on to be certified platinum or multi-platinum in numerous territories, while four of its singles attained commercial success. In the United States, the album was certified platinum and the singles &quot;The Look&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; both topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Dressed for Success&quot; reached numbers 2 and 14, respectively, on the same chart.

== Background and release ==
&quot;Dressed for Success&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s first two singles in Sweden, with Per Gessle and EMI choosing to highlight Marie Fredriksson as Roxette&#x27;s lead vocalist. They were immediate hits in Sweden, peaking at numbers two and three, respectively. &quot;Chances&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single in France, Germany and Italy, but it failed to chart.

&quot;The Look&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in January 1989, becoming another top 10 hit in their home country. While studying there, an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman, purchased the album and brought it home, giving a copy of it to his local Top 40 radio station, KDWB 101.3 FM. &quot;The Look&quot; quickly became popular, and the station began distributing the track to their sister radio operations. EMI America had previously rejected the duo as unsuitable for the American market, and Roxette did not have a recording contract there.

&quot;The Look&quot; had already entered the top 50 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 before the duo began official promotion. It would go on to peak at number one eight weeks later. It gradually became a global hit over the next year, topping the charts in 25 countries. It also spent six weeks at number one on the Australian Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s previous singles—excluding &quot;Chances&quot;—were re-released internationally. Roxette would go on to have four number ones on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;; while the album&#x27;s final single, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, peaked at number two.

== Critical reception ==
The album received mixed reviews from critics. In a retrospective review, AllMusic complimented its singles, but said that the album tracks &quot;aren&#x27;t necessarily filler, but they also aren&#x27;t as strong as many of the cuts that made up Roxette albums that followed. [...] Only &#x27;Chances&#x27; and &#x27;Shadow of a Doubt&#x27; show glimmers of the skills the duo would soon flourish.&quot; A review for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; echoed a similar sentiment, praising its singles and &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;—along with &quot;Cry&quot;—but said that: &quot;the problem is that most of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;″s music is of such a light, ephemeral nature that it disappears without a trace the minute the record leaves the turntable. Looks like Roxette&#x27;s forte is pop music that is prettily presented but totally disposable.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
Roxette were nominated for two Grammis Awards—the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards—in 1989, for Artist of the Year and Best Pop/Rock Group. Fredriksson and Gessle each won an award for Best Pop/Rock Female and Best Composer, respectively. Both Roxette and Fredriksson won numerous Rockbjörnen awards during this period. They were awarded Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group at the 1988 ceremony, and won the latter award again the following year. Fredriksson won the award for Best Swedish Female over four consecutive years, from 1986 to 1989.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; was an immediate commercial success in Sweden, selling over 140,000 copies within ten days of release. It spent seven weeks at number one, and was certified platinum in the country for shipments in excess of 100,000 units. In the US, the album was certified platinum on 20 January 1990 by the RIAA for shipments in excess of one million units. As of 2009, it sold 408,000 copies there since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in May 1991. It peaked at number four in the UK, where it spent over a year on the charts. It was certified platinum by the BPI in December 1990 for sales in excess of 300,000. As of 2001, &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; had sold over 9 million copies worldwide.

<text>The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), also known as the sand puppy, is a burrowing rodent native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, notably in Somali regions. It is closely related to the blesmols and is the only species in the genus Heterocephalus. 

The naked mole-rat exhibits a highly unusual set of physiological and behavioral traits that allow it to thrive in a harsh underground environment; most notably its being the only mammalian thermoconformer with an almost entirely ectothermic (cold-blooded) form of body temperature regulation, as well as exhibiting eusociality, a complex social structure including a reproductive division of labor, separation of reproductive and non-reproductive castes, and cooperative care of young. The closely related Damaraland mole-rat (&quot;Fukomys damarensis&quot;) is the only other known eusocial mammal. Naked mole-rats lack pain sensitivity in their skin, and have very low metabolic and respiratory rates. The animal also is remarkable for its longevity and resistance to cancer and oxygen deprivation.

While formerly considered to belong to the same family as other African mole-rats, Bathyergidae, more recent investigation places it in a separate family, Heterocephalidae.

==Description==
Typical individuals are long and weigh . Breeding females are larger and may weigh well over , the largest reaching . They are well adapted to their underground existence. Their eyes are quite small, and their visual acuity is poor. Their legs are thin and short; however, they are highly adept at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed just behind the teeth, preventing soil from filling their mouths while digging. About a quarter of their musculature is used in the closing of their jaws while they dig. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin. They lack an insulating layer in the skin.

==Physiology==
===Metabolism and respiration===
The naked mole-rat is well adapted to the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels of its typical habitat. It has underdeveloped lungs and its hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about 70% that of a mouse, thus using oxygen minimally. In response to long periods of hunger, its metabolic rate can be reduced by up to 25 percent.

The naked mole-rat survives for at least 5 hours in air that contains only 5% oxygen; it does not show any significant signs of distress and continues normal activity. It can live in an atmosphere of 80% and 20% oxygen. In zero-oxygen atmosphere, it can survive 18 minutes apparently without suffering any harm (but none survived a test of 30 minutes). During the anoxic period it loses consciousness, its heart rate drops from about 200 to 50 beats per minute, and breathing stops apart from sporadic breathing attempts. When deprived of oxygen, the animal uses fructose in its anaerobic glycolysis, producing lactic acid. This pathway is not inhibited by acidosis as happens with glycolysis of glucose. As of 2017, it was not known how the naked mole-rat survives acidosis without tissue damage.

===Thermoregulation===
The naked mole-rat does not regulate its body temperature in typical mammalian fashion. They are thermoconformers rather than thermoregulators in that, unlike other mammals, body temperature tracks ambient temperatures. The relationship between oxygen consumption and ambient temperature switches from a typical poikilothermic pattern to a homeothermic mode when temperature is at 29 °C or higher. At lower temperatures, naked mole-rats can use behavioral thermoregulation. For example, cold naked mole-rats huddle together or seek shallow parts of the burrows that are warmed by the sun. Conversely, when they get too hot, naked mole-rats retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of the burrows.

===Pain insensitivity===
The skin of naked mole-rats lacks neurotransmitters in their cutaneous sensory fibers. As a result, the naked mole-rats feel no pain when they are exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with substance P, a type of neurotransmitter, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.

Naked mole-rats&#x27; substance P deficiency has also been tied to their lack of the histamine-induced itching and scratching behavior typical of rodents.

===Resistance to cancer===
Naked mole-rats have a high resistance to tumours, although it is likely that they are not entirely immune to related disorders. A potential mechanism that averts cancer is an &quot;over-crowding&quot; gene, p16, which prevents cell division once individual cells come into contact (known as &quot;contact inhibition&quot;). The cells of most mammals, including naked mole-rats, undergo contact inhibition via the gene p27 which prevents cellular reproduction at a much higher cell density than p16 does. The combination of p16 and p27 in naked mole-rat cells is a double barrier to uncontrolled cell proliferation, one of the hallmarks of cancer.

In 2013, scientists reported that the reason naked mole-rats do not get cancer can be attributed to an &quot;extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan&quot; (HMW-HA) (a natural sugary substance), which is over &quot;five times larger&quot; than that in cancer-prone humans and cancer-susceptible laboratory animals. The scientific report was published a month later as the cover story of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;. A few months later, the same University of Rochester research team announced that naked mole-rats have ribosomes that produce extremely error-free proteins. Because of both of these discoveries, the journal &quot;Science&quot; named the naked mole-rat &quot;Vertebrate of the Year&quot; for 2013.

In 2016, a report was published that recorded the first ever discovered malignancies in two naked mole-rats. However, both animals were captive-born at zoos, and hence lived in an environment with 21% atmospheric oxygen compared to their natural 2–9%, which may have promoted tumorigenesis.

The Golan Heights blind mole-rat (&quot;Spalax golani&quot;) and the Judean Mountains blind mole-rat (&quot;Spalax judaei&quot;) are also resistant to cancer, but by a different mechanism.

In July 2023 a study reported the transference of the gene responsible for HMW-HA from a naked mole rat to mice leading to improved health and an approximate 4.4 percent increase in median lifespan for the mice.

===Longevity===
Naked mole-rats can live longer than any other rodent, with lifespans in excess of 37 years; the next longest-lived rodent is the African porcupine at 28 years. The mortality rate of the species does not increase with age, and thus does not conform to that of most mammals (as frequently defined by the Gompertz-Makeham law of mortality). Naked mole-rats are highly resistant to cancer) and maintain healthy vascular function longer in their lifespan than shorter-living rats. Queens age more slowly than nonbreeders.

The mechanisms underlying naked mole-rat longevity are debated, but are thought to be related to their ability to substantially reduce their metabolism in response to adverse conditions, and so prevent aging-induced damage from oxidative stress. This has been referred to as &quot;living their life in pulses&quot;. Their longevity has also been attributed to &quot;protein stability&quot;. Because of their extraordinary longevity, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole-rat. A draft genome was made available in 2011 with an improved version released in 2014. Its somatic number is 2n = 60. Further transcriptome sequencing revealed that genes related to mitochondria and oxidation reduction are expressed more than they are in mice, which may contribute to their longevity.

The DNA repair transcriptomes of the liver of humans, naked mole-rats, and mice were compared. The maximum lifespans of humans, naked mole-rats, and mice are respectively c. 120, 30 and 3 years. The longer-lived species, humans and naked mole-rats, expressed DNA repair genes, including core genes in several DNA repair pathways, at a higher level than did mice. In addition, several DNA repair pathways in humans and naked mole-rats were up-regulated compared with mice. These findings suggest that increased DNA repair facilitates greater longevity, and also are consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.

===Size===
Reproducing females become the dominant female, usually by founding new colonies, fighting for the dominant position, or taking over once the reproducing female dies. These reproducing females tend to have longer bodies than that of their non-reproducing counterparts of the same skull width. The measurements of females before they became reproductive and after show significant increases in body size. It is believed that this trait does not occur due to pre-existing morphological differences but to the actual attainment of the dominant female position. As with the reproductive females, the reproductive males also appear to be larger than their non-reproducing counterparts but the difference is smaller than in females. These males also have visible outlines of the testes through the skin of their abdomens. Unlike the females, there are usually multiple reproducing males.

===Chronobiology===
The naked mole-rat&#x27;s subterranean habitat imposes constraints on its circadian rhythm. Living in constant darkness, most individuals possess a free-running activity pattern and are active both day and night, sleeping for short periods several times in between.However, colonies do not exhibit synchronized cicadian sleep-wake cycles.

==Ecology and behavior==

===Distribution and habitat===
The naked mole-rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, predominantly southern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.

===Roles===
The naked mole-rat was the first mammal found to be eusocial. The Damaraland mole-rat (&quot;Fukomys damarensis&quot;) is the only other eusocial mammal currently known.

The social structure of naked mole-rats is similar to that of ants, termites, and some bees and wasps. Only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony function as workers. The queen and breeding males are able to breed at one year of age. Workers are sociologically but not physiologically sterile. Smaller workers focus on gathering food and maintaining the nest, while larger workers are the tunnelers, volcanoers, and the most reactive to threats. The non-reproducing females appear to be reproductively suppressed, meaning the ovaries do not fully mature, and do not have the same levels of certain hormones as the reproducing females. By contrast, there is little difference of hormone concentration between reproducing and non-reproducing males. In experiments where the reproductive female was removed or died, one of the non-reproducing females would take over and become sexually active. Non-reproducing members of the colony cooperate to care for the pups produced by the queen (usually their mother or sister). Workers keep the pups from straying out of the nest, groom the pups, and snuggle to keep them warm, extend tunnels in search of food, bring food to the nest, and defend pups from attacks by predators and foreign colonies.

====Queen and gestation====
The relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years; other females are temporarily sterile. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females that attempt to exert physical dominance, or that produce hormones associated with becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, often after a violent struggle with her competitors. Once established, the new queen&#x27;s body expands the space between the vertebrae in her backbone to become longer and ready to bear pups. 

In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days. Gestation lasts about 70 days. Litter size is typically 3 to 12 pups; the average litter size is 11-12 The young are born blind and weigh about . The queen nurses them for the first month, after which the other members of the colony feed them fecal pap until they are old enough to eat solid food.

In most female mammals the number of mammae is about double the average litter size. Presumably this enables females to successfully nurse litters even if some mammae fail to produce milk. Naked mole-rats break this &quot;one-half rule&quot; – field caught and lab born litters averaged 11 to 12 pups, and numbers of mammae on wild and captive females were similarly 11 to 12. Maximum litter sizes were 28 in the field and 27 in captivity, whereas the maximum number of mammae was 15. Breeding female naked mole-rats can bear and successfully rear litters that are far more numerous than their mammae because young take turns nursing from the same mammary and breeding females and pups are fed and protected by colony mates, enabling queens to concentrate their reproductive efforts on gestation and lactation.

====Workers====
The queen is the most active member of a colony, and she induces workers to increase their activities by repeatedly shoving them. Smaller workers focus on acquiring food and maintaining tunnels, while the larger workers react strongly to disturbances. As in honey bees, the workers are divided along a continuum of different worker-caste behaviors instead of being in discrete groups. Larger workers function primarily as tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, volcanoers, ejecting earth excavated during tunneling onto the ground surface, and assoldiers, protecting the group from outside predators. Smaller workers perform colony maintenance tasks such as foraging, nest building, and pup care. Workers that find new food sources (tubers) in their vast subterranean burrow systems give a special vocalization on their way back to the nest and wave the food around once they get there. Recruits find the new site by following an odour trail left by the initial scout -- a behavior somewhat analogous to trail deposition and following by ants and termites.

====Dispersers====
Inbreeding is common among naked mole-rats within a colony This results in colony members being extremely closely related, which in turn favors nepotism among non-breeders toward siblings. However, prolonged inbreeding is usually associated with lower fitness. Interestingly, the discovery of male and female dispersers has revealed that there is a mechanism of inter-colony outbreeding.Dispersers are morphologically, physiologically and behaviorally distinct from colony members and actively seek to leave their burrow when an escape opportunity presents itself. These individuals are equipped with generous fat reserves for their journey. Though they possess high levels of luteinizing hormone, dispersers are only interested in mating with individuals from foreign colonies rather than their own colony&#x27;s queen. They also show little interest in working cooperatively with colony members in their natal burrow. Hence, disperser morphs are well-prepared to promote the establishment of new, initially outbred colonies, before cycles of inbreeding resume.

====Colonies====
Colonies average 75-80 individuals, but may contain more than 300, and their tunnel systems can stretch 3 to 5 kilometres (2–3 mi) in cumulative length.

Laboratory colonies are xenophobic, and will attack and kill invaders from different colonies. Likewise, wild colonies sometimes expand their territories by invading neighboring colonies. Invaders may kidnap small pups and incorporate them into their own colony&#x27;s workforce, an intriguing convergence with the behavior of slave-making ants. 

===Female mate choice===
In lab experiments, reproductively active female naked mole rats tended to associate with unfamiliar males (usually non-kin) when given a choice, whereas reproductively inactive females did not discriminate. The preference of queens for unfamiliar males likely is an adaptation to reduce inbreeding; however, within established colonies queens rarely have opportunities to express such preferences. Evolutionarily, outbreeding may be preferred because it reduces the likelihood of expressing deleterious recessive alleles, whereas inbreeding results in closer genetic relationships among naked mole-rat families, favoring self-sacrificial and nepotistic behaviors.

===Diet===
Naked mole-rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as a thousand times the body weight of a typical mole-rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations. A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food—lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in the mole-rats&#x27; intestines ferment the fibres, allowing otherwise indigestible cellulose to be turned into volatile fatty acids.

Naked mole-rats sometimes also eat their own feces. This behavior not only nourishes pups post-weaning but also is part of their eusocial behavior: a mechanism of sharing and assessing hormones from the queen.

===Predators===
Naked mole rats are primarily preyed upon by snakes—especially the Rufous beaked snake and Kenyan sand boa—as well as honey badgers and various raptors. They are at their most vulnerable when &quot;volcanoing&quot; (ejecting soil to the surface).

==Conservation status==
Naked mole-rats are not threatened. They are widespread, numerous and, being subterranean, essentially unnoticeable in the drier regions of East Africa (except for their small &quot;volcanoes&quot; of ejected earth).

==&quot;The Photo Ark&quot;==
A naked mole-rat living at the Lincoln Children&#x27;s Zoo was the first animal to be photographed for the National Geographic project, &quot;The Photo Ark&quot;, which has the goal of photographing all species living in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries around the globe in order to inspire action to save wildlife.

<text>Plestiodon egregius, the mole skink, is a species of small lizard endemic to the Southeastern United States.

==Taxonomy==
The species is subdivided into five subspecies, including the nominotypical subspecies:
*Florida Keys mole skink, &quot;P. e. egregius&quot; : occurs only on some of the Florida Keys.
*Cedar Key mole skink, &quot;P. e. insularis&quot; : occurs only on three islands at Cedar Key.
*Bluetail mole skink, &quot;P. e. lividus&quot; : occurs only in Central Florida; shares its Florida Scrub habitat with the Sand Skink.
*Peninsula mole skink, &quot;P. e. onocrepis&quot; .
*Northern mole skink, &quot;P. e. similis&quot; .

The species was first described by Baird in 1859 as &quot;Plestiodon egregius&quot;. In 1871, &quot;P. onocrepis&quot; was described by Cope. In 1875, the two species were reassigned to the genus &quot;Eumeces&quot;. In 1935, two subspecies were defined, &quot;E. e. egregius&quot; and &quot;E. e. onocrepis&quot;, and in 1957, &quot;E. e. similis&quot; was separated from &quot;E. e. egregius&quot;. In 2005 North American members of genus &quot;Eumeces&quot; were reassigned to &quot;Plestiodon&quot;.

==Status==
The first three subspecies listed above are protected, and the bluetail mole skink is classified as a federally-threatened species since 1987. The major threats to all three subspecies are habitat destruction due to residential, commercial, and agricultural development and over-collection by herpetological enthusiasts. The remaining two subspecies are rather common, though elusive. The northern mole skink also occurs in southern Alabama and Georgia.

==Habitat==
Mole skinks are found in sandhills and scrub. They often like to be buried underground and especially like to bask in the upper layers of Southeastern pocket gopher mounds.

==Reproduction==
Mole skinks reach sexual maturity after one year. They mate in winter; the female lays three to seven eggs in spring in a shallow nest cavity less than below the surface. The eggs incubate for 31 to 51 days, during which time the female tends the nest.

==Bluetail mole skink==
===Description===
The bluetail mole skink is a small, shiny, cylindrical lizard of a brownish color. Juveniles usually have a blue tail which makes up slightly more than half of the animal&#x27;s total length. Regenerated tails and the tails of older individuals are typically pinkish. The legs are somewhat reduced in size and are used only during surface locomotion, not when the animal &quot;swims&quot; through the sand (Christman 1992). During the breeding season, males develop a colorful orange pattern on their sides.

The bluetail mole skink grows to .

===Habitat and behavior===
It shares habitat with the sand skink, which is also endangered, but does not compete with it: whereas the sand skink feeds underground, the bluetail mole skink hunts on the surface.
When threatened, it plays presents its tail and if refused, plays dead.

===Diet===
Like other mole skinks, it feeds primarily on cockroaches, spiders, and crickets.

===Geographic range===
It is found in central Florida.
Map should also reflect Seminole and Orange counties. Also sighted in Volusia, Brevard, Marion, Sumter, and Pasco Counties.

===Conservation status===
The bluetail mole skink is a federally-threatened species.

<text>Juliette Lake Lewis (born June 21, 1973) is an American actress, singer and musician. She is known for her portrayals of offbeat characters, often in films with dark plots, themes and settings. Lewis gained prominence in American cinema during the early 1990s, appearing in various independent and arthouse films. She has received various accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards.

The daughter of actor Geoffrey Lewis, Lewis began her career in television at age 14 before making her film debut in &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988). This was followed by bigger parts in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989) and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991), the latter of which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Subsequent credits included &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), &quot;Kalifornia&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (both 1993), &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995) and &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996).

Lewis received an Emmy Award nomination for the television film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002), and went on to co-star in the mainstream features &quot;Enough&quot; (2002), &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot; (both 2003) and &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (2004). She embarked on a musical career in 2003, forming the rock band Juliette and the Licks. Since 2009, she has been releasing material as a solo artist. Her film credits during the 2010s included &quot;Conviction&quot; (2010), &quot;The Switch&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;Ma&quot; (2019). Lewis has worked more frequently in television since the mid 2010s, appearing in major roles on series such as &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; (2015), &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; (2015–2016), &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Chippendales&quot; (both 2022) and &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; (2021–2023).

==Early life==
Juliette Lake Lewis was born June 21, 1973, in Los Angeles, California, to actor Geoffrey Lewis and his first wife, Glenis ( Duggan) Batley, a graphic designer. She has eight siblings, which include a step-sister.

Lewis&#x27; parents divorced when she was two years old, and she spent her childhood living between both their homes in the Los Angeles area. She also lived for a brief period with actress Karen Black, who was a mentor to her. Lewis dropped out of high school at age 15.

==Career==
===1987–1999: Early career and success===

Following an uncredited role in &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; (1980), Lewis made her first major screen appearance in the television film &quot;Home Fires&quot; (1987). Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised her performance in the latter, writing that she &quot;lights up the screen&quot;. She then starred as Kate Farrell on the ABC sitcom &quot;I Married Dora&quot;, which ran between 1987 and 1988. At age 14, she was legally emancipated from her parents—with their approval—enabling her to work more freely. She later recalled, &quot;I know that sounds all radical, but when you start acting when you&#x27;re younger, you talk to other actor kids and their moms, and they&#x27;re like, &#x27;Yeah, if you want to get a job, they like [your] resume to say emancipated minor versus minor, because you then can work [longer hours]&#x27;&quot;.

Lewis had a minor part in the science fiction comedy &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988)—playing Lexie, the best friend of main character Jessie—before landing her first major supporting role as Audrey Griswold in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), which is now regarded as a &quot;classic&quot; in its genre. Regarding her involvement with the film and the opportunity to work with co-star Chevy Chase, Lewis later reflected, &quot;even at [age] 15, I knew it was a big deal&quot;. She followed this with appearances in the comedies &quot;Meet the Hollowheads&quot; and &quot;The Runnin&#x27; Kind&quot;, as well as a guest-starring role as Delores on the coming-of-age drama series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; (all 1989).

In 1990, Lewis co-starred with Brad Pitt, whom she would go on to date for four years, in the Lifetime television film &quot;Too Young to Die?&quot;, a crime drama based loosely on the case of Attina Marie Cannaday. Lewis played Amanda, a troubled teenager who falls into a world of prostitution and drugs. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ray Loynd felt that the film worked due to its &quot;compelling script [and Lewis&#x27;] authentic portrayal of the young and abused murderess whose first question to her public defender [is] whether he has any sugar-coated candies&quot;.

Lewis garnered international attention when she beat out 500 other actresses to play Danielle Bowden, the daughter of a family targeted by psychopathic criminal Max Cady, in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962). Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded her performance, calling her &quot;a new young actress of stunning possibilities&quot;, while &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Duane Byrge commented, &quot;Perhaps providing the strongest real counterbalance to De Niro&#x27;s crazy Cady is Juliette Lewis, whose [performance] shows the most sinewy fiber&quot;. She went on to receive Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for the role. Retrospectively, the sequence in which her character is seduced by Cady was named one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot;. On working with Scorsese, Lewis has since said, &quot;I liken that period of time to being anointed, or getting my creative wings ... [the experience] changed me [and] gave me a confidence ... It wasn&#x27;t [about] the outside accolades. It was [Scorsese] nurturing my ingredients as a performer&quot;.

In 1992, Lewis had a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot;, with Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describing her portrayal of Rain—a &quot;Lolita&quot;-esque college student— as &quot;sumptuous&quot;. She headlined the romantic drama &quot;That Night&quot; the same year, a coming-of-age story set in the 1960s. Lewis appeared in several films in 1993, including Peter Medak&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;, where she played the mistress of a corrupt cop. She then reunited with Brad Pitt in &quot;Kalifornia&quot;, co-starring as the girlfriend of a serial killer. Critic Roger Ebert deemed Lewis&#x27; portrayal of the childlike Adele one of &quot;the most harrowing and convincing performances I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. At the time of filming &quot;Kalifornia&quot;, Lewis and Pitt had been in a relationship since 1990, though they separated the year of its release. Next, she appeared as a psychiatric patient in the music video for Melissa Etheridge&#x27;s &quot;Come to My Window&quot;, and starred in the Lasse Hallström-directed &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (also 1993), playing Becky, a free-spirited drifter who befriends a young man and his disabled brother in a small Midwestern town.

Lewis received the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the 1994 Venice Film Festival for her portrayal of Mallory Knox, a murderous woman who embarks on a killing spree with her psychotic lover, in Oliver Stone&#x27;s satiric, controversial crime film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. Though criticized for its excessive violence and influencing of copycat crimes, with Lewis later admitting that playing a woman who displays such &quot;volatility and repulsive behavior&quot; had had a detrimental effect on her career, her performance in &quot;Killers&quot; was roundly praised, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers deeming it &quot;sensational&quot;:

Lewis had a supporting role that same year in Nora Ephron&#x27;s Christmas-themed black comedy &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;. She then starred as rock singer Faith Justin in Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s experimental science fiction film &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995), doing her own singing on covers of two songs written by PJ Harvey. Though a box-office failure, &quot;Days&quot; went on to develop a cult following in later years. Next, Lewis made a &quot;massively disturbing&quot; appearance as a heroin addict in &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot; (also 1995), a crime drama based on Jim Carroll&#x27;s memoir of the same name.

In 1996, Lewis had supporting roles in comedy-drama &quot;The Evening Star&quot;—a sequel to &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983)—and the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez action horror film &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin pointed out that the role of &quot;clean-living ingenue&quot; Kate Fuller in &quot;Dawn&quot; was an ironic departure for Lewis. She next appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;Some Girl&quot; (1998), followed by &quot;The Other Sister&quot; (1999), in which she portrayed an autistic woman attempting to achieve independence. The film received largely unfavorable reviews, though Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that it was &quot;beautifully acted&quot;, noting, &quot;Carla is played by Ms. Lewis with enormous heart and sensitivity, and with body language so precise that you soon forget it is a performance&quot;. Lewis later admitted to having been &quot;scared&quot; by the challenge of portraying somebody with a neurological disorder, saying that it was &quot;the hardest role I have ever had to play&quot;.

===2000–2010: Film, television, and music===

Lewis received praise for her performance in &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot; (2000), the directorial debut of Christopher McQuarrie. Writing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Marjorie Baumgarten felt her portrayal of pregnant kidnap victim Robin was imbued &quot;with rich veins of honesty and truth&quot;. That same year, she provided vocals for the track &quot;Bad Brother&quot; by Infidels, which featured on the soundtrack to &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot;. She then headlined the neo-noir crime film &quot;Picture Claire&quot; (2001), followed by a supporting role in the independent lesbian-themed comedy &quot;Gaudi Afternoon&quot; (2001). The latter received unfavorable reviews, with A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that Lewis and co-star Lili Taylor &quot;overact like second-string sketch performers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&quot;. Next, she played the concerned best friend of a woman trapped in a violent relationship in &quot;Enough&quot; (2002), a big-budget thriller directed by Michael Apted.

Lewis received Emmy and Independent Spirit Award nominations for her performance in the 2002 television film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot;, where she co-starred as the friend of a woman in 1980s New Jersey who receives an unfortunate diagnosis. She then appeared in the poorly received &quot;Cold Creek Manor&quot; (2003), a thriller directed by Mike Figgis, playing the battered &quot;white-trash&quot; girlfriend of an unstable villain. Next, she featured in the music video for HIM&#x27;s &quot;Buried Alive By Love&quot; and played the supporting role of Heidi in Todd Phillips&#x27; 2003 comedy &quot;Old School&quot;.
Beginning in 2003, Lewis embarked on a musical career, forming the rock band Juliette and the Licks with former Hole drummer Patty Schemel. The band released their debut EP, &quot;...Like a Bolt of Lightning&quot;, in late 2004 through Fiddler Records. That same year, she featured as a guest vocalist on The Prodigy&#x27;s album &quot;Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned&quot;, played the supporting role of Kitty in the big-budget action comedy &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, and headlined &quot;Blueberry&quot;, a French acid Western directed by Jan Kounen. She subsequently starred in comedy-drama &quot;Daltry Calhoun&quot; (2005), playing the girlfriend of a Tennessee entrepreneur, and in the romantic drama &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot; (also 2005), playing the live-in assistant of an elderly couple. In May 2005, Juliette and the Licks released their debut studio album, &quot;You&#x27;re Speaking My Language&quot;. The band toured internationally in support of the album, receiving a favorable concert review from &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s David Peschek, who wrote that Lewis is &quot;exactly the kind of iconic presence that boringly boy-saturated rock needs&quot;.

Lewis had supporting parts in two comedies released in 2006: &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; and &quot;Catch and Release&quot;. Around the same time, Juliette and the Licks recorded their second studio album—&quot;Four on the Floor&quot;—which was released in 2007. Lewis appeared in Rockstar Games&#x27; &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; the following year, providing the voice of &quot;Juliette&quot;, the host of fictional radio station Radio Broker. Next, she played a key role in Drew Barrymore&#x27;s directorial debut, the 2009 comedy-drama &quot;Whip It!&quot;, and provided voice work for the animated science fiction film &quot;Metropia&quot; (also 2009), directed by Tarik Saleh. Describing her portrayal of an aggressive roller derby captain in &quot;Whip It&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that Lewis was &quot;all grimy attitude and slinky rock-chick insouciance&quot;. She released her first solo studio album that same year, titled &quot;Terra Incognita&quot;, through The End Records.

In 2010, Lewis starred in a number of films, first appearing in Mark Ruffalo&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Sympathy for Delicious&quot;, followed by romantic comedy &quot;The Switch&quot;, in which she appeared as the best friend of a woman trying to conceive a child through artificial insemination. She also portrayed a murder witness in the biographical crime drama &quot;Conviction&quot;, with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; calling her a &quot;scene-stealer&quot;, and the Boston Society of Film Critics awarding her Best Supporting Actress. She reprised the role of Heidi—her character in &quot;Old School&quot;—that same year in the black comedy &quot;Due Date&quot;.

===2011–present: Television and film roles===
Lewis&#x27; first film of 2011 was the independent drama &quot;Hick&quot;, in which she starred as the alcoholic mother of a young girl in 1980s Nebraska. She subsequently had a minor role in the Canadian drama &quot;Foreverland&quot;, followed by the 2012 thriller &quot;Open Road&quot; and the short-lived NBC legal drama series &quot;The Firm&quot;, on which she co-starred as secretary Tammy Hemphill. Next, Lewis had a central role in &quot;&quot; (2013), playing one of several sisters who reunite with their dysfunctional mother in the wake of their father&#x27;s suicide. A 
tragicomedy based on the Tracy Letts , the film 
was met with mixed reviews, but critics singled out Lewis as one of its strengths, with &quot;SFGate&quot;″s Mick LaSalle feeling that her portrayal of youngest sibling Karen was the only performance to 
have &quot;a complete grasp of the material&#x27;s proper tone&quot;. &quot;Osage&quot; was a box-office success, grossing over $74 million worldwide.
Lewis was involved in musical projects in 2013, providing backing vocals on Joseph Arthur&#x27;s album &quot;The Ballad of Boogie Christ&quot; and appearing in the music video for &quot;City of Angels&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars. Her next film roles were the 2014 independent features &quot;Hellion&quot;, for which she received positive notices, and &quot;Kelly &amp; Cal&quot;, where she starred as a punk rocker-turned-suburban housewife. Her portrayal of Kelly in the latter was particularly well received, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting that it &quot;crackle[s] with authenticity&quot;, adding:

Lewis&#x27; next role was in &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot; (2015), an adaptation of the 1980s animated series &quot;Jem&quot;, where she played a music producer. The film was a financial disappointment for Universal and received a largely negative response from critics. She followed this with a starring role as a small-town detective on the ABC crime drama series &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, which ran for two seasons. The show received a mixed reception, with Neil Genzlinger commenting in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Ms. Lewis&#x27;s dour detective character, Andrea Cornell, is a cliché stretched beyond the point of believability&quot;. Next, she had a recurring guest role on the first season of the science fiction mystery series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; (2015), contributed vocals to the song &quot;Stickup&quot; by Karma Fields and Morten, and played the mother of a high schooler in techno-thriller &quot;Nerve&quot; (2016).

In November 2016, the independently released EP &quot;Future Deep&quot; marked Lewis&#x27; first solo musical project in seven years. She guest-starred as Bailey Todd on the second season of Epix&#x27;s &quot;Graves&quot; the following year, and subsequently appeared as a fun-loving reiki healer on the HBO comedy series &quot;Camping&quot; (2018), a remake of the British show of the same name. Judy Berman of &quot;Time&quot; gave the latter an unfavorable review, writing that Lewis is &quot;underutilized, as usual&quot;. She co-starred in the independent feature &quot;Back Roads&quot; that same year, a drama about a young man trapped by circumstance in rural Pennsylvania after his mother—Lewis—murders his father. Writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Frank Scheck said it offered &quot;many powerful moments&quot; and featured an &quot;excellent&quot; performance from Lewis. Next, she played a supporting role in Sam Taylor-Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, adapted from the book of the same name. In late 2018, Lewis was cast in the recurring role of Blue on the debut season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Conners&quot;—a spin-off from &quot;Roseanne&quot;—where she appeared for three episodes.

In Tate Taylor&#x27;s 2019 psychological horror film &quot;Ma&quot;, Lewis played the mother of a teenage girl who grows close to a disturbed woman in their neighborhood. The Blumhouse production was a box-office success, grossing over $60 million worldwide. Lewis reunited with Taylor for the same year&#x27;s &quot;Breaking News in Yuba County&quot;, co-starring as Gloria Michaels, and appeared in the guest role of Kathy on Hulu&#x27;s strongly reviewed crime series &quot;The Act&quot;, a drama based on the murder of Dee Dee Blanchard.

Lewis starred on the Showtime mystery thriller series &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; between November 2021 and May 2023, portraying Natalie Scatorccio, a plane crash survivor haunted by painful secrets. The show was received enthusiastically by critics, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Leila Latif calling Lewis &quot;sublime&quot;, noting that &quot;[she] stunningly performs the nuances of tentative empathy and glimmers of optimism within a deep chasm of grief&quot;. Of her involvement with the series, Lewis said, &quot;I was so in fear of being typecast that I worried people wouldn&#x27;t know what goes into a character like this. Natalie is nothing like myself. But because there&#x27;s certain things, like &#x27;tough&#x27; and &#x27;wrong side of the tracks&#x27; or whatever, people think it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve played before, but I haven&#x27;t. [It has taken] me like 30 years for people to go, &#x27;Wow, she does unpredictable stuff, and it&#x27;s high quality&#x27;&quot;. During that same period, Lewis appeared as Judy on Peacock&#x27;s reboot of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (2022) and co-starred in the biographical Hulu miniseries &quot;Welcome to Chippendales&quot; (also 2022). Richard Roeper called the latter &quot;colorful and shiny but increasingly dark and twisted&quot; in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, adding that Lewis&#x27; portrayal of forthright costume designer Denise Coughlan was &quot;outstanding&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1989, Lewis was arrested at age 16 for entering a bar unlawfully, later being charged with underage drinking.

Lewis was born into Scientology and started practicing it in the 1990s. She credited Scientology&#x27;s Narconon program for helping her rehabilitate after a years-long addiction to cocaine and prescription medication in her early adult years. When asked in 2010 by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; if she was a Scientologist, Lewis responded, &quot;I am, yeah&quot; and went on to explain, &quot;I&#x27;m a Christian! I think there&#x27;s so much confusion because people don&#x27;t understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; in 2015, Lewis remarked about protecting her freedom of choice and religion, and being annoyed at people&#x27;s misconceptions about Scientology: &quot;Whatever people&#x27;s conceptions are of me, I think it&#x27;s cute. I roll with it&quot;. By 2021, she began to distance herself from Scientology, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that she is a spiritualist and does not identify as a Scientologist.

Lewis married professional skateboarder Steve Berra in September 1999. She filed for divorce in April 2003. Lewis described the divorce as &quot;amicable&quot;, later commenting, &quot;Steve would be the first to admit he was a workaholic. You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you&#x27;re like, &#x27;Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing&#x27;&quot;.

Lewis has supported Little Kids Rock, an American nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools, by painting a Fender Stratocaster guitar and donating it to an auction to raise money for the organization.

==Acting credits and accolades==
Lewis is known for acting in films such as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991), &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993), &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996), &quot;The Other Sister&quot; (1999), &quot;Old School&quot; (2003), &quot;Conviction&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2013), and &quot;Nerve&quot; (2016). On television, she began her career acting in the ABC sitcom &quot;I Married Dora&quot; (1987–1988). She later acted in the legal series &quot;The Firm&quot; (2012), the mystery series &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; (2015–2016), the comedy series &quot;Camping&quot; (2018), and the miniseries &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot; (2019). She earned acclaim for playing Natalie Scatorccio in the Showtime thriller series &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; from 2021 to 2023.

Over her career Lewis has received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a rebellious teenager in the Martin Scorsese thriller &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991). She was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her role playing a flirty teenager in the HBO film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002) and as an outspoken costume designer in the Hulu miniseries &quot;Welcome to Chippendales&quot; (2022).

<doc id="484076" wikidata="Q24324" url="?curid=484076" title="Pearls of Passion">
<text>Pearls of Passion is the debut studio album by Swedish pop duo Roxette, originally released on cassette and vinyl on 31 October 1986 in Scandinavia and Canada. The album was remastered and released on CD on 31 October 1997, with several previously unreleased bonus tracks. It was remastered and re-released again in 2009.

==Background and recording==
Roxette are a Swedish duo consisting of Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, who were both established artists in their home country prior to the duo forming. Gessle had experienced considerable commercial success with his previous band Gyllene Tider, releasing three number one albums in Sweden during the early &#x27;80s. When the band broke up in 1984, however, Gessle&#x27;s solo albums failed to replicate that level of success: 1983&#x27;s &quot;Per Gessle&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Scener&quot; both failed commercially. The latter peaked at number 39 on Sverigetopplistan, and sold less than 20,000 copies—a substantial drop from 400,000 copies sold by Gyllene Tider&#x27;s self-titled debut album five years earlier. Gessle later revealed his contract with EMI Sweden was close to being terminated after the commercial performance of &quot;Scener&quot;.

Meanwhile, Fredriksson was also signed to EMI Sweden, and had released two commercially successful albums: 1984&#x27;s &quot;Het vind&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Den sjunde vågen&quot;, as well as several hit singles. On the advice of Rolf Nygren – the managing director of EMI Sweden – Gessle translated a song called &quot;Svarta glas&quot; (&quot;Black Glass&quot;) into English. It was originally written for Pernilla Wahlgren. Nygren then suggested that Gessle record the song as a duet with Fredriksson. This became the duo&#x27;s first single, &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, which peaked at number three on the Swedish Singles Chart. The rest of the album was recorded sporadically throughout the summer of 1986.

&quot;Dance Passion&quot;, a compilation EP containing seven remixed versions of tracks found on &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot;, was released in Sweden in 1987, and a further two songs from the album were re-recorded for inclusion on later Roxette albums: CD versions of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Joyride&quot; contained a version of &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, while &quot;Tourism&quot;, released the following year, contained an acoustic version of &quot;So Far Away&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Jason Damas from AllMusic gave the album a negative review, rating it one-and-a-half stars out of five and writing: &quot;Nothing here is bad, but it lacks nearly all of the elements that made &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot; massive hits just a few years later.&quot; He elaborated that &quot;Roxette&#x27;s most intriguing qualities are that they are a pop band that can rock, and that Per Gessle is a crack songwriter that almost never produces a bad tune. Here, however, there&#x27;s a lot of indistinguishable dance-pop, and their trademark gritty guitars are completely absent&quot;. He went on to say that the album contained three great songs: &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, &quot;Neverending Love&quot; and &quot;Secrets That She Keeps&quot;, but charactised the rest of the album as being &quot;insignificant, except to the most serious of fans.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The record was an immediate commercial success in Sweden, peaking at number two on the albums chart, and going on to sell over 200,000 copies by the end of 1987. However, it failed to chart internationally. &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, &quot;Goodbye to You&quot;, &quot;Soul Deep&quot; and &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; were released as singles, with the first three becoming top twenty hits in Sweden. A non-album single, &quot;It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted)&quot;, was released in December 1987, and became their second top five hit there. The song was later re-recorded – with the reference to Christmas changed to a neutral winter reference (&quot;It&#x27;s a hard Christmas Day&quot; replaced by &quot;It&#x27;s a hard winter&#x27;s day&quot;) – and became a substantial international hit after appearing on the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

&quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; was remastered and released on CD for the first time eleven years after its original release, on 31 October 1997. Three songs were re-released as promotional singles in selected territories to promote the reissue: &quot;From One Heart to Another&quot; was issued as a promotional single in Brazil, and a slightly remixed version of &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; – &quot;I Call Your Name &#x27;97&quot; – was released as an airplay-only single in Spain. EMI Spain also reissued &quot;Neverending Love&quot;, to commemorate shipments of over 50,000 units of the album in that country. As of 2001, &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; has sold 800,000 copies worldwide.

<doc id="484083" wikidata="Q966962" url="?curid=484083" title="Thomas William Rhys Davids">
<text>Thomas William Rhys Davids (12 May 1843 – 27 December 1922) was a Welsh scholar of the Pāli language and founder of the Pāli Text Society. He took an active part in founding the British Academy and London School for Oriental Studies.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas William Rhys Davids was born at Colchester in Essex, England, the eldest son of a Congregational clergyman from Wales, who was affectionately referred to as the Bishop of Essex. His mother, who died at the age of 37 following childbirth, had run the Sunday school at his father&#x27;s church.

Deciding on a Civil Service career, Rhys Davids studied Sanskrit under A.F. Stenzler, a distinguished scholar at the University of Breslau. He earned money in Breslau by teaching English.

== Civil service in Sri Lanka ==
In 1863 Rhys Davids returned to Britain, and on passing his civil service exams was posted to Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). When he was Magistrate of Galle and a case was brought before him involving questions of ecclesiastical law, he first learned of the Pāli language when a document in that language was brought in as evidence.

In 1871 he was posted as Assistant Government Agent of Nuwarakalaviya, where Anuradhapura was the administrative centre. The governor was Sir Hercules Robinson, who had founded the Archaeological Commission in 1868.

Rhys Davids became involved with the excavation of the ancient Sinhalese city of Anuradhapura, which had been abandoned after an invasion in 993 CE. He began to collect inscriptions and manuscripts, and from 1870-1872 wrote a series of articles for the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society Journal about them. He learned the local language and spent time with the people.

Rhys Davids&#x27; civil service career and his residence in Sri Lanka came to an abrupt end. Personal differences with his superior, C. W. Twynham, caused a formal investigation, resulting in a tribunal and Rhys Davids&#x27; dismissal for misconduct. A number of minor offenses had been discovered, as well as grievances concerning fines improperly exacted both from Rhys Davids&#x27; subjects and his employees.

== Academic career ==
He then studied for the bar and briefly practised law, though he continued to publish articles about Sri Lankan inscriptions and translations, notably in Max Müller&#x27;s monumental Sacred Books of the East.

From 1882 to 1904 Rhys Davids was Professor of Pāli at the University of London, a post which carried no fixed salary other than lecture fees.

In 1905 he took up the Chair of Comparative Religion at the University of Manchester.

Rhys Davids attempted to promote Theravada Buddhism and Pāli scholarship in Britain. He actively lobbied the government (in co-operation with the Asiatic Society of Great Britain) to expand funding for the study of Indian languages and literature, using numerous arguments over how this might strengthen the British hold on India.

== Personal life ==
In 1894 Rhys Davids married Caroline Augusta Foley, a noted Pāli scholar. Unlike his wife, however, Rhys Davids was a critic and opponent of Theosophy. They had three children. The eldest, Vivien, was involved in the Girl Guide movement and was a friend of Robert Baden-Powell. Their only son, Arthur Rhys Davids, was a Royal Flying Corps 25-victory fighter ace who was killed in World War I.

Rhys Davids died on 27 December 1922 in Chipstead, Surrey.

<doc id="484086" wikidata="Q645006" url="?curid=484086" title="Joyride (Roxette album)">
<text>Joyride is the third studio album by Swedish pop rock duo Roxette, released on 25 March 1991 by EMI as the follow-up to their international breakthrough &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; (1988), as well as the non-album single &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, from the soundtrack to &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990). The album was recorded over an 11-month period in Sweden. The duo experienced considerable pressure from their record label to deliver a successful follow-up album, and resisted pressure to relocate to Los Angeles and work with experienced American producers.

The album was a critical and commercial success upon release, with a retrospective review for AllMusic calling it &quot;the work of two pop artists at the top of their game.&quot; &quot;Joyride&quot; topped the charts in seven European countries, and was certified multi-platinum in several territories. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time in Argentina, Austria and Germany. &quot;Joyride&quot;, &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)&quot;, &quot;The Big L.&quot;, &quot;Spending My Time&quot; and &quot;Church of Your Heart&quot; were released as singles.

The band toured extensively to support the record, performing to over 1.7 million people across four continents during the &quot;Join the Joyride! Tour&quot;. As of 2001, the album has sold over 11 million copies worldwide. An expanded 30th-anniversary edition of the album was released on 26 November 2021.

==Background and recording==
Roxette&#x27;s primary songwriter, Per Gessle, began work on the album in February 1990 at the Tits &amp; Ass recording studio in Halmstad—which he co-founded in 1984 with his then-Gyllene Tider bandmate, lead guitarist Mats &quot;MP&quot; Persson. The pair recorded rough demo versions of ten songs over a three-week period, after which they were joined by vocalist Marie Fredriksson, who then provided input on re-arranging some of the material. By the end of April, the three had completed work on over twenty-five demos.

Work was transferred to EMI Studios in Stockholm in May, where Gessle and Fredriksson were joined by producer Clarence Öfwerman. With the success of previous album &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; (1988) and its singles, as well as the non-album single &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, the duo resisted pressure from record company EMI to relocate to Los Angeles and work with American producers and musicians, opting instead to &quot;develop our own sound&quot; with the Swedish musicians they had worked with previously. Gessle has described the pressure to deliver a successful follow-up album as &quot;intense&quot;, with EMI investing almost US$2 million on pre-release promotion for &quot;Joyride&quot;. Gessle later said that he wrote the album with the intention of it sounding &quot;like a greatest hits record. ... It was never a given that &quot;Joyride&quot; was gonna be a major success just because &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; sold millions. We were lucky that the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; movie happened in between those albums, so the world never got the chance to forget about us! I knew that &quot;Joyride&quot; had to be really focused with lots of single &#x27;wannabes&#x27;, so I think I wrote about 30 songs to make it happen. It was fun. All of us were very motivated.&quot;
All of the lyrics on the album were written by Gessle, who also composed the majority of its music—with the exception of &quot;Spending My Time&quot;, &quot;(Do You Get) Excited?&quot; and &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, which were co-composed with Persson; Fredriksson co-wrote the music to one of the album&#x27;s louder rock songs, &quot;Hotblooded&quot;, and is the sole composer of ballad &quot;Watercolors in the Rain&quot;. She composed its music using lyrics which were written several years prior by Gessle, who expressed interest in the pair composing this way more regularly on future material, saying: &quot;When it&#x27;s happening like that [me writing lyrics and Marie composing music], it makes Roxette even better because it widens up what we can do, what kind of music we can make, even more. So I think she should write more.&quot; Her limited input in the songwriting of Roxette material stemmed from difficulty with writing English lyrics: she has said that it &quot;feels very strange to write in another language.&quot; The song is more folk-orientated than any material previously recorded by the duo, and is indicative of Fredriksson&#x27;s Swedish-language solo work.

==Singles and promotion==
The title track was released as the album&#x27;s first single. It became one of Roxette&#x27;s biggest ever hits, and was one of the most successful singles of 1991. It was the duo&#x27;s first number one single in their home country, and topped the charts in numerous other territories. The song spent eight weeks at number one in Germany, where it was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie for sales in excess of 250,000 copies. It spent three weeks atop the Australian Singles Chart, and was their fourth and last US number one single. It also topped the singles chart in Canada, where it was nominated for a Juno Award in 1992 for Best Selling Single by a Foreign Artist. &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)&quot; was released as the second single. It also became a hit, particularly in North America, where it peaked at number two in both Canada and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—held off the top spot in both countries by Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot;. &quot;The Big L.&quot; was released as the third single outside of North America in August, peaking within the top twenty of numerous territories.

In September, Roxette began their Join the Joyride! Tour. Opening on 4 September in Helsinki, the tour would see the band playing to over 1.7 million people during its 100 shows in Europe, Australia and North and South America. The South American leg of the tour was particularly successful, with the band playing to nearly 350,000 people at thirteen concerts, resulting in a 27% increase in album sales. The North American leg of the tour received mixed reviews. A review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed that Fredriksson was &quot;squandering her talents in pop&#x27;s low-rent district. She&#x27;s clearly superior to Roxette&#x27;s uncomplicated, hook-crammed material&quot;; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized their show for its &quot;careful mimicry of MTV. On a set painted in Piet Mondrian primary colors, Miss Fredriksson struts, leans on the other band members, makes symmetrical arm motions, pouts and straps on a guitar to take a few chords; she took off her leather jacket and later her long sleeves, like a G-rated stripper.&quot;
The end of 1991 saw the merger of the SBK, Chrysalis and EMI record labels to form EMI Records Group North America. The merger resulted in the new company firing over a hundred members of staff, and saw Roxette receiving little support from their new label. Subsequent singles from the album, &quot;Spending My Time&quot; and &quot;Church of Your Heart&quot;, peaked at numbers thirty-two and thirty-six, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—in stark contrast to the duo&#x27;s previous five singles which all peaked within the top two of the chart. A music video for &quot;(Do You Get) Excited?&quot; was created, although its planned single release was later cancelled.

==Release and artwork==
&quot;Joyride&quot; was released worldwide on CD, MD, DCC, cassette and LP formats from 25 March 1991 by EMI, with varying track listings. CD and cassette editions contained fifteen tracks, with the exception of all North American editions, which omitted the song &quot;I Remember You&quot; and moved the re-recorded version of &quot;Soul Deep&quot; (originally released as a single from their 1986 debut album &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot;) up the running order. All LP versions of the album contained twelve songs: omitting &quot;I Remember You&quot;, &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, and the album&#x27;s fifth and final single, &quot;Church of Your Heart&quot;. The album was remastered and reissued on CD and via digital download services in 2009. This reissue restored the album&#x27;s original fifteen song track list, and included three B-sides as bonus material. The version released on iTunes contained a further three bonus tracks: a demo of &quot;Come Back (Before You Leave)&quot;, the US single version of &quot;Joyride&quot;, and a Humberto Gatica remix of &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)&quot;.

The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed by Roxette and Kjell Andersson. It consists of brightly coloured images, which were inspired by South American carnivals, funfairs, and the artwork for the Beatles&#x27; 1967 EP &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. The principal photographer of the album&#x27;s cover was Mattias Edwall, with the set designed by Mikael Varhelyi, who would later become the supervising art director of the 2011 version of &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. The title track features The Beatles&#x27; former tour manager Dave Edwards, who is credited with narration. Gessle has said that its title was derived from an interview given by Paul McCartney, in which he described writing songs with John Lennon as &quot;a long joyride&quot;.

A 30th-anniversary edition of the album was released on 26 November 2021. The set consisted of the 15-track version of the album and a further two CDs of rare and unreleased material; a quadruple LP version was also issued.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic called the record the work of &quot;two pop artists at the top of their game&quot;, and praised the album&#x27;s consistency, saying: &quot;most of the songs sound like they were designed to be hit singles, not just filler between two or three good cuts.&quot; When reviewing the album, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the band to ABBA, calling them &quot;worthy successors to the tradition of air-headed catchiness set down by their fellow Swedish pop tarts&quot;, and complimented the album for an abundance of hooks. Conversely, J.D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that although Roxette had similarities to ABBA, they were &quot;different in the way that matters most—its music&quot;, and praised the duo for their performance which he said &quot;marks perhaps the most important difference between Roxette and [ABBA]. By emphasizing its sense of personality, Roxette delivers more than just well-constructed hooks; this music has heart, something that makes even the catchiest melody more appealing.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1992, Roxette were nominated for numerous Grammis Awards, the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. &quot;The Big L.&quot; was nominated for Music Video of the Year, and &quot;Joyride&quot; won them the Pop Group of the Year Award. Roxette and Gessle were also respectively nominated for Artist of the Year and Composer of the Year, while the album&#x27;s guitarist, Jonas Isaacson, was awarded the Special Prize of the Year Award. Roxette also won several Rockbjörnen awards during this period, winning the award for Best Swedish Group at both the 1991 and 1992 ceremonies, with &quot;Joyride&quot; also winning the award for Best Album by a Swedish Group in 1991.

<text>Akaroa is a small town on Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury Region of the South Island of New Zealand, situated within a harbour of the same name. The name Akaroa is Kāi Tahu Māori for &quot;Long Harbour&quot;, which would be spelled in standard Māori. The area was also named &quot;Port Louis-Philippe&quot; by French settlers after the reigning French king Louis Philippe I.

The town is by road from Christchurch and is the terminus of State Highway 75. It is set on a sheltered harbour and is overlooked and surrounded by the remnants of an eruptive centre of the miocene Banks Peninsula Volcano. 
==History==
In 1830, the Māori settlement at Takapūneke, east of the current town of Akaroa, was the scene of a notorious incident. It followed an earlier incident in 1832 in which Te Rauparaha, fresh from his successful three-month siege of Kaiapoi Pā, took the pā on the Ōnawe Peninsula at the head of Akaroa Harbour. There were an estimated 400 Kāi Tahu in the pā and most were killed, with only the strongest taken as slaves. The captain of the British brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, John Stewart, helped North Island Ngāti Toa chief, Te Rauparaha, to capture the local Kāi Tahu chief, Tama-i-hara-nui, his wife Te Whe and his young daughter, Roimata. The settlement of Takapūneke was sacked. Several hundred were killed and dozens enslaved. Stewart could not be convicted of murder owing to the lack of a suitable legal system in New Zealand at the time. This incident was one of several lawless acts committed by Stewart around this time. The actions of John Stewart were examples of other incidents of lawlessness among Europeans in New Zealand, which contributed to the appointment of an official British Resident James Busby to New Zealand in 1832.

The earliest European settlers used Akaroa as a whaling base. Akaroa is now one of the few whaling bases in New Zealand that still exists as a town. 

===French settlement===
In the 1830s, France developed extensive plans for colonial expansion, including into the Pacific where at that time it had no colonies. This included the South Island of New Zealand. The tiny settlement established at Akaroa can be viewed in the context of that failed, wider project. In 1838, a whaler, Captain Jean François Langlois, wrote up a questionable deed of purchase for &quot;the greater Banks Peninsula&quot; to which twelve Kāi Tahu chiefs each added their moko or cross. The price was 1,000 francs (£40), with a deposit of 150 francs (£6) paid in goods and the remainder to be paid upon Langlois&#x27; return from France with settlers. When the settlers later did arrive, the British authorities – who had in the meantime taken possession of the whole of New Zealand – decided a valid sale had not taken place in 1838, relying for their decision on English law and Māori oral evidence.

While back in France, Langlois had raised capital from wealthy businessmen to fund the planned whaling and colonising venture. The Nanto-Bordelaise Company was set up, with the major shareholder being Adolphe Balguerie. Langlois ceded his supposed Banks Peninsula title to the company, took a minor shareholding and was entrusted with the whaling side of the venture. 

The company is comparable to the British &quot;New Zealand Association&quot; (later a company) but unlike the British, who arranged for all land sold by the indigenous Māori to go through its government representative, the French government planned to have Māori land sales arranged through the company. The model treaties for land acquisition sent out from France can be compared with the Treaty of Waitangi, used by the British as their way of acquiring Māori land. The French government became involved and in order to send out the settlers it supplied the warship, &quot;Mahé&quot;, fitted out as a whaler and renamed &quot;Comte de Paris&quot;. On 9 March 1840, 63 emigrants left Rochefort. They were accompanied by the &quot;Aube&quot;, a 28-gun corvette under Commodore , whose role was also to oversea French whaling interests around New Zealand.

The ships arrived in the Bay of Islands in the North Island on 11 July 1840, where they learned that during their voyage William Hobson had proclaimed British sovereignty over all New Zealand on 21 May, and that the main South Island Māori chiefs had signed the Treaty of Waitangi. Hobson, who was now lieutenant-governor, wanted there to be no doubt that British sovereignty extended over all New Zealand and so to counter any potential threat to that situation, he dispatched the brig-sloop, HMS Britomart, to call first at Port Nicholson where the New Zealand Company settlers had recently arrived and established their own fledgling government, and thence to Akaroa. Once there, Britomart and fluttering Union Jacks would provide a less than subtle welcome for the soon to arrive French settlers and squash any sovereignty pretentions Lavaud might have had. Back in the Bay of Islands, while discussions on land rights took place, the French colonisation continued. On 18 August 1840, the settlement at Akaroa began, with 57 settlers including 12 Germans. (Some had died en route.) The settlers&#x27; land was around German Bay (Takamatua), French Town (Akaroa) and the hill behind. For the first six years, the settlers were outnumbered by a large contingent of French sailors and naval officers. They were all part of a sizeable infrastructure that included Catholic missionaries, churches, and priests taking classes. In addition, there was a French mayor, French doctors in a French hospital and a French store. There were also French by-laws and a French court of justice. Bishop Pompallier established his first European station in Akaroa in 1840 as the French immigrants were all nominally Catholic. However, he closed the station in disgust, due to the religious apathy of the French immigrants. The area still shows a French influence, prominent in many local place names. It is the oldest town in Canterbury and one of the most historic places in New Zealand.

Meanwhile, the British dismissed the Nanto-Bordelaise Company&#x27;s claim as it was not based on British law, but only after extensive and complex negotiations had taken place with Māori and the French, represented by Commadore Lavaud and the company&#x27;s urbane agent, Pierre-Joseph de Belligny. Land ownership discussions dragged on until 1849, and by then both governments back in Europe had become involved. Given that the French colonists had set out for New Zealand on the assumption that they owned the land, Lord Stanley, of the Colonial Office, instructed the New Zealand authorities in 1845 to grant 30,000 acres to the Nanto-Bordelaise Company. This grant never actually happened at that time and the 30,000 acres were never clearly defined, but all concerned acted as if the company now owned that land. The company by then was in a dire financial position and was keen to raise funds by selling that land, which it did before becoming insolvent in 1849. Some land was sold to individual settlers but most was bought by the New Zealand Company, which had still not decided on a place in the area to establish its own settlement. To the indignation of Langlois, the Nanto-Bordelaise Company had sold all its remaining land on the peninsula for £4,500. So by 1849, the French settlers were on their own in a British colony.

Before 1840, the area of the current Akaroa town was also known as Wangaloa. The French at first called their settlement &quot;Port Louis-Philippe&quot; in honour of Louis Philippe I, who reigned as King of the French from 1830 to 1848.

===British settlement===
After being informed of the French intention to colonise Akaroa and to further its use as a whaling port, the Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, sent the ship to proclaim sovereignty over the area for the British Crown. HMS &quot;Britomart&quot; arrived in Akaroa on 16 August 1840, although the captain&#x27;s log shows the arrival date as 11 August. Captain Stanley raised the British flag, and held a court at each of the occupied settlements, to convince the French that the area was indeed under British control. A monument at the eastern edge of the town commemorates the British arrival.

James Robinson Clough, also known as Jimmy Robinson, had arrived at Akaroa several years before. He acted as interpreter for Captain Owen Stanley at the flag-raising of 1840, and was the first European to travel up the Avon River / Ōtākaro in 1843. Clough&#x27;s descendants are still prominent on the Peninsula today.

British immigrants settled in both Akaroa and German Bay (Takamatua), along with many German farmers, who set up dairy, sheep and cocksfoot (&quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;) farms. The great majority of the artefacts currently held at Akaroa Museum are of the early farming community and their way of life at the time.

Arriving from England in April 1850, the &quot;Monarch&quot;, needing repairs&quot;,&quot; sailed into Akaroa Harbour. It was bound for Auckland however forty of the passengers decided to stay in Akaroa. The British immigrants settled at the southern end of Akaroa with the French living at the northern end with a small bay separating the two. 

Akaroa was described in 1854 as “altogether very like a small seaside village in England”. In 1878, there were only ten French born residents in the town of Akaroa out of a population of 642 people. A further 27 French born people lived outside the town boundaries.

Businesses grew in Akaroa and by 1883 there were five builders, four confectioners, eight general stores, five milk-sellers, four shoemakers, two bankers, five milliners and five blacksmiths.

Daly&#x27;s wharf was built between 1863 and 1865 and refurbished in 1914. Located at the end of Rue Balguerie, it has been used by coastal ships and fishing boats. At the end of the wharf, an octagonal building with a turret roof was built by 1932.

Akaroa was described as a “long favourite holiday haven not only for New Zealanders but visitors from Australia and the Old World” in 1903. At this time, most of Akaroa was concentrated around the waterfront with only a few houses built on the hillsides. The population living in Akaroa was 559 people with a total of 124 houses in 1901.

The main wharf at Akaroa was built in 1887. Plans were made in 2022 to rebuild the main wharf in the same position that it currently is, as it was nearing the end of its useable life. The rebuild is expected to cost $19.1 million and be completed by 30 June 2025.

== Tourism ==
Akaroa is a popular resort town. Many Hector&#x27;s dolphins can be found within the harbour, and in the area of the Akaroa Marine Reserve at the harbour entrance. &#x27;Swim with the dolphins&#x27; boat tours are a major tourist attraction. Akaroa became a popular cruise ship destination after the 2011 Canterbury Earthquakes damaged the port of Lyttelton. In the summer of 2009–10, Akaroa was visited by seven cruise ships. This increased to ninety cruise ships in 2019 and 2020. The numbers reduced to 19 cruise ships in 2022 with the opening of Lyttelton cruise ship berth.

==Education==
Akaroa&#x27;s first primary school opened in 1857, and the first high school followed in 1883. The high school was for boys only in the first year but became co-educational in the second year. However, in 1900 it closed due to a lack of paying students. The next year, it re-opened as a free District High School. It moved to the current site in 1935. In 2007, the primary school was merged with it to form Akaroa Area School. This is now a co-educational composite school covering years 1 to 13, with a roll of as of 

== Museum ==
The Akaroa museum, first opened in 1964, concentrates on the history of Akaroa and the Banks Peninsula. It is located at 71 Rue Lavaud and includes within the museum complex: the 1850s customs house, the 1878 court house and the 1840s Langlois-Eteveneaux cottage. In 2023, the museum put on an exhibition called &quot;Catching Shadows&quot; which displayed a photographic history of Banks Peninsula starting in the early 1840s.

== Akaroa lighthouse ==

The Akaroa lighthouse has sat at Cemetery Point in the township since 1980. For the 100 years prior to that, it was located above sea level on a headland at Akaroa heads. The original site was chosen in 1875. In 1877, the lens and mount were ordered from France and the mechanism from Scotland. The road to the lighthouse had to be blasted out of solid rock and took ten months to complete. Construction of the lighthouse finally began in 1879. Unfortunately, a southerly storm demolished the framework completely and work had to start again from scratch, this time with a stronger design. The tall light house was completed in 1880 and when operating, its light could be seen away. A telephone was installed in the lighthouse in 1885, and a kerosene generator was installed in 1935, allowing the light to be automated. This was converted to diesel in 1951. In 1977 a new automatic lighthouse was built to replace the original staffed lighthouse. In 1980, the original lighthouse was moved in pieces and then reassembled in its current position in the town of Akaroa. The Akaroa lighthouse is open for viewing on Sundays and on days when cruise ships visit the town.

== Churches ==

=== Onuku Church ===
Onuku Church is a historic undenomnational church located in The Kaik, near Akaroa. This church had its foundation stone laid in November 1876 and was completed in 1878. It is located at the Ōnuku marae. Built out of timber with a pitched shingle roof, it has a bell turret and room for 60 parishioners. After falling into disrepair around 1939, work was completed to restore the church and add traditional carved panels to the porch. Services were held regularly until 1963.

=== Saint Patrick&#x27;s Catholic church ===
This was the third Catholic church to be built in Akaroa, replacing the two earlier churches. It was designed by Christchurch architects Benjamin Mountfort and Maxwell Bury and built in 1865 out of timber. A porch was added in 1886 and a bell tower in 1893. A stained glass window depicting the crucifixion was added in 1930.

=== Saint Peter&#x27;s Anglican church ===
Saint Peter&#x27;s Anglican church was built out of timber in the Gothic revival style and was completed in 1863. It replaced the previous Anglican church which was built eleven years earlier in 1852. A pipe organ was added in 1869. Benjamin Mountfort designed the transepts and chancel in 1877.

=== Trinity Presbyterian church ===
The Trinity Presbyterian church was completed in 1886, thirty years after the first Presbyterian services were held in a private home. Built in the Gothic revival style with a steep roof, it was designed by Christchurch architect, John Whitelaw. In 1912, a church hall was added. It was listed by Heritage New Zealand as a category two historic place in 1990.

== Utilities ==
A water supply scheme in Akaroa provides drinking water for around 1000 properties in the Akaroa township, and a further 130 properties in Takamatua. Water is sourced from four streams and two wells, and is treated at the L&#x27;Aube Hill water treatment plant.

<text>Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta (; 10 February 1950 – 23 March 1994) was a Mexican politician, economist, and Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential candidate, who was assassinated at a campaign rally in Tijuana during the Mexican presidential campaign of 1994.

==Political history==
Colosio was the son of Luis Colosio Fernández and Armida Ofelia Murrieta García. Born into a family with a long political heritage in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, Colosio&#x27;s family was of Italian and Spanish descent.

Colosio-Murrieta studied economics at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, better known by its initials ITESM, after which he joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1972. Shortly thereafter, he began postgraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania and research at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria before returning to Mexico. In 1979, he joined the Secretariat of Budget and Planning under future president Carlos Salinas de Gortari.

He was elected to Congress as the federal deputy for his home town in 1985 and, in 1987, he was selected to serve on the PRI&#x27;s National Executive Committee. In 1988, Salinas chose him as the campaign manager for his presidential campaign. In the same election, Colosio was elected to the Senate, representing Sonora.

In the early years of Salinas&#x27;s presidency, Colosio served as the chairman of their party&#x27;s National Executive Committee. In 1992, Salinas chose him to serve in his cabinet, in the newly created position of Social Development Secretary.

==Campaign for president==
After a slow start, with the spotlight focusing on former foreign minister Manuel Camacho&#x27;s negotiations with the EZLN guerrillas, Colosio appeared to get the traditional support of the political machine of the PRI. Like all the PRI&#x27;s previous presidential candidates, he was greeted by large crowds throughout his presidential campaign, although the PRI&#x27;s waning popularity meant some reduction in initial enthusiasm.

===Speech on 6 March 1994===
On 6 March 1994, the anniversary of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the PRI), Colosio delivered a controversial but popular speech in the nation&#x27;s capital, in front of the Monument to the Mexican Revolution. In it, he spoke of indigenous communities, government abuse, and the people&#x27;s independence from government, all hot button issues at a time when the Zapatistas were making similar statements. The speech is widely considered the moment when Colosio broke with then-president Salinas.

===Camacho vs Colosio===

Since Mexico&#x27;s constitution permits presidents to remain in power for only one term, and as an extralegal rule presidents (until Salinas) handpicked their own successors (the party&#x27;s first primary election in history took place in 1999), Colosio apparently continued to enjoy the president&#x27;s favour, expressed in his famous declaration &quot;No se hagan bolas: el candidato es Colosio&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t get confused: Colosio is the candidate&quot; would be an appropriate translation, literally it means &quot;Don&#x27;t get tied up in knots: Colosio is the candidate&quot;).

Salinas&#x27;s declaration was motivated by persistent rumors that highly visible Camacho would replace Colosio, who was not doing well in his campaign. Camacho let speculation grow for some time, but eventually declared he would not run for office, concentrating his attention on the Chiapas rebellion instead. The day after Camacho&#x27;s statement, Colosio was killed.

==Death==

At 5:05 pm PST, on 23 March 1994, at a campaign rally in Lomas Taurinas, a poor neighborhood of Tijuana, Baja California, Colosio was shot in the head with a .38 Special that was originally purchased in San Francisco. Colosio collapsed, and was subsequently rushed to the city&#x27;s main hospital, after plans to fly him to an American hospital across the border were canceled. His death was announced a few hours later, amid contradicting eyewitness reports that remain to this day.

The shooter, Mario Aburto Martínez, was arrested at the site and never wavered from his story that he had acted alone. Nonetheless, many theories still surround Colosio&#x27;s assassination. The authorities were criticized for their poor handling of Aburto, having shaved, bathed and given him a prison haircut before showing him to the media, which started rumors about whether that man, who looked so different from the one arrested, was really the murderer. Colosio received three bullet wounds, and it was never clear if they could have been fired by a single person or not. The case was officially closed after many different prosecutors investigated it, but after the many mishandlings of the investigation and contradictory versions, the controversy continues. Aburto remains imprisoned at the high-security &quot;La Palma&quot; facility in Almoloya de Juárez.

There are a number of conspiracy theories about the assassination, including that it was by narcotraffickers. However, the most accepted theory among the Mexican people is that he was betrayed by his own party and that the murder was orchestrated by high members of the PRI including President Salinas, as Colosio&#x27;s speech was moving away from Salinas&#x27;s political agenda to maintain influence during further Mexican administrations. Shortly after Colosio was assassinated, Salinas abruptly ended a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, publicly referring to the slaying as an &quot;act of infamy.&quot;

On 18 November 1994, Diana Laura Riojas, the wife of Colosio, died while investigating the murder of her husband; officially she died from pancreatic cancer. The newly elected president Ernesto Zedillo did not attend her funeral.

==Aftermath==
With only four months before the election, the PRI found itself hamstrung by the constitutional requirement that no presidential candidate can hold public office during the six months immediately prior to the election; this effectively disqualified the entire cabinet, where most of the more promising replacements were. Of the few potential candidates available, Salinas eventually chose Zedillo, who had just resigned as Education Minister to serve as Colosio&#x27;s campaign manager, because Manlio Fabio Beltrones, a very close collaborator of the murdered candidate, showed a video where Colosio praised Zedillo. This stroke of luck for Zedillo, who would have never been a candidate under normal circumstances, gave rise to even more rumours – unfounded or not.

A few months later, Salinas&#x27;s brother-in-law, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, president of the PRI, was also murdered in plain daylight in Mexico City, eliminating the two most visible and powerful official heads of the PRI in Mexico, Colosio and Ruiz Massieu. Eventually Ernesto Zedillo was elected president.

Eight months after Colosio&#x27;s assassination, his wife, Laura Riojas, died of cancer. News magazine &quot;Proceso&quot; reported Colosio&#x27;s widow&#x27;s first words upon learning of her husband&#x27;s assassination: &quot;Who did it?&quot; Two children, now cared for by relatives, survived. Colosio&#x27;s father continued determined to uncover what he strongly suspected are hidden truths behind his son&#x27;s very public murder and, in 2004, he published a book about the case. He died in 2010.

On a visit to Lomas Taurinas on February 11, 2021, Luis Donaldo Colosio Riojas said he forgave ″the cowards″ who had killed his father. He also criticized the political class that kidnaps the power to serve their evil groups and interests and he condemned the fact that calls for unity and solidarity from the leaders are not heard.

==Colosio in popular culture==

&quot;Colosio: El asesinato&quot; (2012), directed by Carlos Bolado, explored the aftermath of the assassination of the candidate and various conspiracy theories. It notes that two investigations were conducted, and details the 15 associated people who were killed following the investigation, as well as widespread violence and unrest.

Mexican rock group El Tri wrote a song about the assassination of Colosio called &quot;Con la cola entre las patas&quot; (With the tail between the legs).

Two Netflix series released in 2019 cover the events leading up to and following Colosio&#x27;s assassination: The documentary &quot;1994&quot;, and the biographical crime drama &quot;Crime Diaries: The Candidate&quot;.

<text>Vito Volterra (, ; 3 May 1860 – 11 October 1940) was an Italian mathematician and physicist, known for his contributions to mathematical biology and integral equations, being one of the founders of functional analysis.

==Biography==
Born in Ancona, then part of the Papal States, into a very poor Jewish family: his father was Abramo Volterra and his mother, Angelica Almagià. Abramo Volterra died in 1862 when Vito was two years old. The family moved to Turin, and then to Florence, where he studied at the Dante Alighieri Technical School and the Galileo Galilei Technical Institute. 

Volterra showed early promise in mathematics before attending the University of Pisa, where he fell under the influence of Enrico Betti, and where he became professor of rational mechanics in 1883. He immediately started work developing his theory of functionals which led to his interest and later contributions in integral and integro-differential equations. His work is summarised in his book &quot;Theory of functionals and of Integral and Integro-Differential Equations&quot; (1930).

In 1892, he became professor of mechanics at the University of Turin and then, in 1900, professor of mathematical physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Volterra had grown up during the final stages of the Risorgimento when the Papal States were finally annexed by Italy and, like his mentor Betti, he was an enthusiastic patriot, being named by the king Victor Emmanuel III as a senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1905. In the same year, he began to develop the theory of dislocations in crystals that was later to become important in the understanding of the behaviour of ductile materials. On the outbreak of World War I, already well into his 50s, he joined the Italian Army and worked on the development of airships under Giulio Douhet. He originated the idea of using inert helium rather than flammable hydrogen and made use of his leadership abilities in organising its manufacture. 

After World War I, Volterra turned his attention to the application of his mathematical ideas to biology, principally reiterating and developing the work of Pierre François Verhulst. An outcome of this period is the Lotka–Volterra equations.

Volterra is the only person who was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians four times (1900, 1908, 1920, 1928).

Volterra was an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. 

In 1922, he joined the opposition to the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and in 1931 he was one of only 12 out of 1,250 professors who refused to take a mandatory oath of loyalty. His political philosophy can be seen in a postcard he sent in the 1930s, on which he wrote what can be seen as an epitaph for Mussolini&#x27;s Italy: &quot;Empires die, but Euclid’s theorems keep their youth forever&quot;. However, Volterra was no radical firebrand; he might have been equally appalled if the leftist opposition to Mussolini had come to power since he was a lifelong royalist and nationalist. As a result of his refusal to sign the oath of allegiance to the fascist government he was compelled to resign his university post and his membership of scientific academies, and, during the following years, he lived largely abroad, returning to Rome just before his death.

In 1936, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, on the initiative of founder Agostino Gemelli.

He died in Rome on 11 October 1940. He is buried in the Ariccia Cemetery. The Pontifical Academy organised his funeral and its President Carlo Somigliana edited a long obituary in the &quot;Osservatore romano&quot; on 12 October 1940.

==Family==

In 1900 he married Virginia Almagia, a cousin. Their son Edoardo Volterra (1904–1984) was a famous historian of Roman law.

Volterra also had a daughter, Luisa Volterra, who married the biologist Umberto D&#x27;Ancona. D&#x27;Ancona piqued his father-in-law&#x27;s interest in biomathematics when he showed Vito a set of data regarding populations of different species of fish in the Adriatic Sea, where decreased fishing activity from the war had led to an increase in the populations of predatory fish species. Vito published an analysis of the dynamics of interacting species of fish the next year.

<doc id="484098" wikidata="Q778920" url="?curid=484098" title="Tourism (Roxette album)">
<text>Tourism: Songs from Studios, Stages, Hotelrooms &amp; Other Strange Places is the fourth studio album by Swedish pop duo Roxette, released on 28 August 1992 by EMI. Despite often being mistaken for a live album, the record was described by Roxette in its liner notes as a &quot;tour album&quot;: the band recorded the majority of its material in numerous recording studios in between live dates of their worldwide Join the Joyride! Tour. The album contains three live concert recordings, while another track was recorded live in an empty nightclub in São Paulo. A further two songs were recorded in Buenos Aires&#x27; Alvear Palace Hotel.

The album received mixed reviews from American publications upon release, with several of them confused over its concept and incorrectly describing it as containing just five previously unreleased songs. It also underperformed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 117 on the chart and selling approximately 278,000 copies—far short of the million-selling &quot;Joyride&quot;. Nevertheless, the album was a commercial success in Europe and was certified platinum in numerous territories. As of 2001, &quot;Tourism&quot; had sold over six million copies worldwide.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Tourism&quot; was described by Roxette in the album&#x27;s liner notes as a &quot;tour album, [...] not a live album&quot;. It consists of songs recorded by the band in various locations during the &quot;Join the Joyride! Tour&quot;. The idea was to &quot;create and collect material along the way; to record our music in different environments in different parts of the world; to take advantage of the excitement and the energy within the band on a tour like this.&quot; It does contain several live recordings, including versions of &quot;The Look&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot; taken from their 13 December 1991 performance at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, as well as an acoustic version of &quot;Joyride&quot; album track &quot;Things Will Never Be the Same&quot; from a November 1991 concert in Zürich. A portion of a live performance of &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; from their 25 April 1992 concert at San Carlos Stadium in Santiago, Chile is used as an intro to a new studio recording of the song. This new version was recorded in Ocean Way Recording Studios in March 1992, and features k.d. lang guitarist Greg Leisz performing pedal steel guitar. Also recorded there was new song &quot;The Heart Shaped Sea&quot;, which again features Leisz.
The band recorded several songs while touring in Latin America in May 1992. Two songs were recorded in Brazil: the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Fingertips&quot;, was recorded in Nas Nuvens Recording Studio in Rio de Janeiro; &quot;Never Is a Long Time&quot; was recorded live in an empty nightclub in São Paulo. &quot;Here Comes the Weekend&quot; and a new version of &quot;So Far Away&quot; – originally released on their 1986 debut &quot;Pearls of Passion&quot; – were recorded live in room 603 of the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 4 May 1992. Two other previously released studio recordings are included on the album: &quot;Silver Blue&quot; was originally released as a b-side to &quot;The Look&quot; in 1988; &quot;Come Back (Before You Leave)&quot; appeared on the &quot;Joyride&quot; single in 1991.

The majority of the remaining tracks were recorded at EMI Studios in Stockholm between late March and early April 1992, with the exception of &quot;Cinnamon Street&quot;, which was overdubbed at Medley Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 6 July. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Queen of Rain&quot;, was recorded in July 1990 in Stockholm during the sessions for &quot;Joyride&quot;. It was originally set to appear as that album&#x27;s final track, but was later excluded in favour of &quot;Perfect Day&quot;. However, the closing notes and sound effects of the &quot;Joyride&quot; version of &quot;Things Will Never Be the Same&quot; – that album&#x27;s second-last song – can still be heard over the crowd noise on the intro of &quot;Queen of Rain&quot;. Until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Charm School&quot; and 2016&#x27;s &quot;Good Karma&quot;, &quot;Tourism&quot; was the first and only Roxette album to not contain any material composed by Marie Fredriksson, who would release her fourth Swedish-language solo album, &quot;Den ständiga resan&quot;, just five weeks after &quot;Tourism&quot; was released.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews upon release. A review for &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the album for abandoning the &quot;production glitz&quot; of past work, while Bryan Buss of AllMusic said that the album &quot;spotlights how strong an act they are even without the benefit of studio production.&quot; He praised the re-recorded version of &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, saying &quot;you have to hear 45,000 Chilean fans singing back-up to truly appreciate what was one of their least affecting ballads&quot;, and said that the album demonstrates &quot;what true pop craftsmanship is.&quot; He compared the album to &quot;Joyride&quot;, saying that both releases contained very little filler, before summarising that &quot;Tourism&quot; was &quot;Not quite a greatest hits package, this is your best bet as an introduction to Roxette.&quot;

Dennis Hunt of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who incorrectly described the album as containing just five new songs, praised Fredriksson&#x27;s vocals. He referred to her as being &quot;one of pop&#x27;s best and most underrated singers&quot;, but said that the material on &quot;Tourism&quot; was &quot;beneath her talents&quot;. He awarded the album two-and-a-half stars out of four, highlighting her performance for transforming &quot;low-grade fluff into passable–often delectable–pop.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to the album as a &quot;stopgap measure between discs&quot;, but said that the &quot;catchy and pop-savvy &quot;Tourism&quot; ain&#x27;t half bad&quot;, awarding the album a grade of B−.

==Commercial performance==
Though not matching the success of the duo&#x27;s previous studio albums, &quot;Tourism&quot; had sold in excess of 6 million copies worldwide. The album had little impact on American music charts, peaking at number 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200—in stark contrast to &quot;Joyride&quot;, which peaked at number 12 on the same chart. As of January 2009, it had sold 278,000 copies in the US. It peaked at number 18 on the national &quot;RPM&quot; albums chart in Canada, where it has been certified platinum by Music Canada (formerly the Canadian Recording Industry Association) for shipments in excess of 100,000 units.

It did far better elsewhere, especially in Europe, topping the European Top 100 Albums chart for four consecutive weeks in September 1992. In the duo&#x27;s native Sweden, the album spent two weeks at number one and was certified triple platinum by the Swedish Recording Industry Association for shipments in excess of 300,000 units. It also topped the charts in other Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland and Norway. The album was a massive commercial success in Germany, spending five consecutive weeks at number one there. It was certified triple gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipments in excess of 750,000 units. The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, where it was held off the top spot by Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot;. It spent 17 weeks on the chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in September 1992, denoting shipments in excess of 100,000 copies.

<doc id="484101" wikidata="Q176455" url="?curid=484101" title="Melanie Griffith">
<text>Melanie Richards Griffith (born August 9, 1957) is an American actress. Born in Manhattan to actress Tippi Hedren, she was raised mainly in Los Angeles, where she graduated from the Hollywood Professional School at age 16. In 1975, 17-year-old Griffith appeared opposite Gene Hackman in Arthur Penn&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Night Moves&quot;. She later rose to prominence as an actor in films such as Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Body Double&quot; (1984), which earned her a National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. Griffith&#x27;s subsequent performance in the comedy &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986) attracted critical acclaim before she was cast in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Working Girl&quot;, which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won her a Golden Globe.

In the 1990s Griffith performed in a series of roles which received varying critical reception; she received Golden Globe nominations for her performances in &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot; (1995), and as Marion Davies in &quot;RKO 281&quot; (1999), while also earning a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performances in &quot;Shining Through&quot; (1992), as well as receiving nominations for &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; (1999) and John Waters&#x27; cult film &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (2000). Other credits include John Schlesinger&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), &quot;Milk Money&quot; (1994), the neo-noir film &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; (1996), as Charlotte Haze in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1997), and &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; (1998).

She played the voice of Margalo in &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002), and later starred as Barbara Marx in &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot; (2003), and spent the majority of the 2000s appearing on such television series as &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, and &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. After acting on stage in London, in 2003, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, receiving celebratory reviews. In the 2010s, Griffith returned to film, starring opposite her then-husband Antonio Banderas in the science-fiction film &quot;Autómata&quot; (2014) and as an acting coach in James Franco&#x27;s &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot; (2017).

==Life and career==
===1957–1969: Early life===
Melanie Richards Griffith was born on August 9, 1957, in Manhattan, New York City, to actress Tippi Hedren and Peter Griffith, a former child stage actor and advertising executive. Griffith&#x27;s paternal ancestry is English, as well as Welsh, Scots-Irish, Irish, and Scottish, while her maternal ancestry is Swedish, Norwegian, and German. Her parents separated when she was two years old, after which she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother. On February 4, 1961, Griffith&#x27;s father married model and actress Nanita Greene and had two more children: Tracy Griffith, who also became an actress, and Clay A. Griffith, a set designer. Her mother married agent and producer Noel Marshall on September 27, 1964.

During her childhood and adolescent years, she lived part of the time in New York with her father and part-time in Antelope Valley, California, where her mother formed the animal preserve Shambala. Griffith appeared in advertisements and briefly worked as a child model before abandoning the career, citing extreme shyness as the reason. While attending the Hollywood Professional School, Griffith was advanced in her studies, which allowed her to skip a grade level and graduate at age 16.

===1969–1979: Career beginnings and first marriage===

Griffith&#x27;s first onscreen appearances were as an extra in &quot;Smith!&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Harrad Experiment&quot; (1973). She had her first major role at age 17 in Arthur Penn&#x27;s film noir &quot;Night Moves&quot; (1975), in which she portrayed a runaway teenager pursued across the United States by a private detective, portrayed by Gene Hackman. In the film, she controversially appeared onscreen nude in several scenes. Griffith&#x27;s performance in &quot;Night Moves&quot; drew attention to her and she was subsequently cast in two 1975 films: the comedy &quot;Smile&quot;, playing a pageant contestant, and Stuart Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;, a thriller in which she portrayed the daughter of a Louisiana woman (played by Joanne Woodward) involved in a crime investigation. She was also named Miss Golden Globe for 1975, helping out at the Golden Globe Awards. A contemporaneous profile of Griffith in &quot;Newsweek&quot; addressed her image at the time, in which it was noted: &quot;She has the body of a sensuous woman, the pouting, chipmunk face of a teenager, and the voice of a childand, suddenly, she&#x27;s showing them all.&quot;

While on the set of The Harrad Experiment, 14-year-old Griffith met actor Don Johnson, then 22. The two began dating, and the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage from January to July 1976. After divorcing Johnson, Griffith subsequently dated Ryan O&#x27;Neal, who was 16 years her senior. In her autobiography, &quot;A Paper Life&quot;, Tatum O&#x27;Neal alleged that Griffith dragged her into an orgy with Maria Schneider and a male hairdresser during the time of her father&#x27;s relationship with Griffith.

In 1977, she had a supporting part playing a hitchhiker in the Lamont Johnson-directed sports drama &quot;One on One&quot;, where John Simon in his review of &quot;One on One&quot; wrote, &quot;Griffith is miscast in a PG picture, where she is obliged to hide her one talent (or two depending on how you count it...them)&quot;. Griffith appeared in the Israeli experimental film &quot;The Garden&quot;, in which she portrayed a naked mute woman in Jerusalem whom a man mistakes for an angel. The same year, she had a supporting role in &quot;Joyride&quot; opposite Robert Carradine, in which she played a young woman who leaves California with her boyfriend, hoping to start a fishing company in Alaska.

===1980–1988: Breakthrough and motherhood===
Griffith appeared opposite her mother, Hedren, in the film &quot;Roar&quot; (1981), directed by her then-stepfather Noel Marshall. In the film, she portrayed the daughter of animal-keepers Madeleine (Hedren) and Hank (Marshall), whose various wild animals turn on them. &quot;Roar&quot; was a project devised by Hedren and Marshall, and has retrospectively been deemed one of the most dangerous film productions of all time. Filming of &quot;Roar&quot; had begun in 1970 and was intermittent over the following decade. On one occasion during the shoot, Griffith was mauled by a lion and had to undergo facial reconstructive surgery. Her attack and injury is visible in the finished film. Also in 1981, Griffith appeared as a Women&#x27;s Army Corps recruit in the made-for-television movie &quot;She&#x27;s in the Army Now&quot; (1981) with Jamie Lee Curtis and Steven Bauer. Shortly after completing the film, Griffith and Bauer married.

Griffith&#x27;s well-known drug and alcohol addictions temporarily stalled her career in the early 1980s, but she made a comeback at age 26 with her role as a pornographic film actor in the Brian De Palma thriller &quot;Body Double&quot; (1984). The film, although a commercial failure, earned her the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then appeared in a supporting role in Abel Ferrara&#x27;s thriller &quot;Fear City&quot; (1985), playing a stripper and prostitute in Times Square being stalked by a serial killer. Griffith gave birth to her first child, Alexander Griffith Bauer, on August 22, 1985, with Bauer. The following year, she had her first starring role opposite Jeff Daniels in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s comedy &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), playing a mysterious woman who becomes involved with a straightlaced banker on a chance meeting. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of her acting: &quot;Griffith&#x27;s performance is based not so much on eroticism as on recklessness: She is able to convince us (and Daniels) that she is capable of doing almost anything, especially if she thinks it might frighten him.&quot; Griffith&#x27;s performance earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. 

Griffith also starred in the speculative science fiction film &quot;Cherry 2000&quot;, which followed a business executive in the year 2017, and his relationship with a sex robot. She subsequently starred opposite Sean Bean, Tommy Lee Jones, and Sting in Mike Figgis&#x27;s neo-noir &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (1988), portraying an American woman who becomes embroiled in her ex-boss&#x27;s plot to acquire a jazz club in Newcastle upon Tyne. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Griffith&#x27;s performance, writing: &quot;The stellar Miss Griffith, with her sexy, singular blend of kittenishness and strength, is entirely at home here, making an irrevocably strong impression.&quot;
Griffith achieved mainstream success when Mike Nichols cast her as spunky secretary Tess McGill in the box-office hit &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), co-starring Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin, and Joan Cusack. &quot;Variety&quot; noted of her performance: &quot;Griffith stands apart, both for her eagerness to break out of her clerical rut and her tenacity dealing with whomever seems to be thwarting her.&quot; Griffith was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. The film marked a professional shift for Griffith earning her accolades as an A-list actress, characterized in a 1989 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; piece: &quot;Before &quot;Working Girl&quot;, Melanie Griffith was known mostly for her beautiful body and the way that nearly half her directors suggested she expose it.&quot;

Griffith and Bauer separated prior to her appearance in &quot;Working Girl&quot;. Griffith later admitted to having problems with cocaine and liquor after her split from Bauer. &quot;What I did was drink myself to sleep at night,&quot; she said. &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t with someone, I was an unhappy girl.&quot; In 1988, after completing rehabilitation, Griffith reconnected with Johnson, and the two remarried on June 26, 1989.

===1989–1995: Mainstream success===
On October 4, 1989, Griffith gave birth to her second child, daughter Dakota Johnson, with Don Johnson. After her pregnancy, Griffith began filming the thriller &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), directed by John Schlesinger, in which she portrayed a woman, who along with her boyfriend, becomes embroiled in a dispute with a criminal boarder in their San Francisco home. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film a middling review, and characterized it as &quot;a horror film for yuppies&quot;. The same year, she reunited with De Palma in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, a black comedy in which she portrayed a Southern belle gold-digger. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; panned the film, noting that it &quot;achieves a consistency of ineptitude rare even in this era of over-inflated cinematic air bags...  Griffith has the curves and the Southern-belle voice of McCoy&#x27;s mistress, Maria Ruskin, but the script robs this magnolia of her steel.&quot;
She was then cast in a lead role in &quot;Paradise&quot; (1991), a remake of the 1987 French film &quot;The Grand Highway&quot;, opposite then-husband Don Johnson, Elijah Wood, and Thora Birch. In the film, Griffith portrayed a woman reeling from the death of her child, who takes in her friend&#x27;s son. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized Griffith&#x27;s &quot;cuddly, melting softness&quot; in the film as being at odds with her character: &quot;The way that Griffith has been directed, Lily never seems less than supremely nurturing. And so the movie — unlike, say, &quot;The Doctor&quot; — pulls back from revealing the dark side of an ordinary person&#x27;s anguish.&quot; In 1992, she starred as Linda Voss, a German Jewish secretary in Berlin, opposite Michael Douglas in &quot;Shining Through&quot;, a World War II-set drama based on the 1988 novel of the same name. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was critical of Griffith&#x27;s portrayal of a German accent, writing: &quot;In all fairness, Griffith shouldn&#x27;t be lambasted for her incompetent accent. She should be lambasted for her acting, too. That baby voice of hers -- what&#x27;s the deal with that? It&#x27;s a liability in most of her movies. Here, it&#x27;s completely ludicrous.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, however, noted Griffith as being &quot;cannily cast&quot; and &quot;just about perfect&quot;.

She followed this with the Sidney Lumet-directed &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot;, in which she portrayed a police officer posing as an Orthodox Jew while investigating a murder. Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; criticized Griffith&#x27;s speaking in the film, writing: &quot;When Griffith tries to speak in the crude manner of a streetwise cop, her baby-doll voice turns the words into strained peaches. And while she&#x27;s capable of projecting the wounded quality that the role demands, she&#x27;s completely unconvincing when it comes to conveying a detective&#x27;s intelligence...  The miraculous thing about &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot; is that Melanie Griffith&#x27;s performance doesn&#x27;t entirely ruin it. In fact, though the movie has other problems, there are sections that work quite well.&quot;

In the summer of 1992, Griffith filmed the comedy &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1993), a remake of the 1950 film, in the role for which Judy Holliday won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Billie Dawn is a naive, uneducated showgirl whose wealthy, powerful and crude long-term fiancé (John Goodman) hires a reporter (Don Johnson) to give her enough polish to make her presentable as his wife in Washington, D.C. &quot;This is supposed to be snappy material, and it comes across gloomy&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote at the time. He faulted the &quot;dumbed down&quot; screenplay, the casting and the lack of chemistry in a film that, in the end, was &quot;morose and mean&quot;. In 1994, Griffith headlined the romantic comedy &quot;Milk Money&quot;, playing a prostitute. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed the film a &quot;brainless comedy,&quot; adding: &quot;The film may try to renounce its own tawdriness, but not Ms. Griffith; she brings a certain irrepressible gusto to her role. Among the few genuinely amusing scenes here are those that show her flouncing through the small town where Frank and Dad live, scandalizing the locals and even finding one ex-client strolling with his wife on Main Street.&quot; The same year, she had a supporting role in &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, a drama starring Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, and Bruce Willis. In the film, Griffith portrays the wife of a contractor (Willis) who has disputes with a free-spirited older man (Newman) in an upstate New York town. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted both Willis and Griffith as &quot;somewhat less reliable&quot; than Newman and Tandy.

Griffith and husband Johnson separated in March 1994, reconciled later that year, but separated again in May 1995, eventually divorcing in 1996. In the midst of her separation, she appeared in an ensemble cast in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Now and Then&quot;, playing an actress who returns to her Indiana hometown to reunite with her childhood friends. Roger Ebert wrote of the film: &quot;The adult actresses are completely superfluous to the movie, which is a contrived &quot;Stand by Me&quot; kind of story.&quot; The same year, she starred opposite Anjelica Huston and Reba McEntire in the Western miniseries &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot;, based on the 1990 novel of the same name. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote of the series that &quot;Huston, Griffith, and McEntire make it not just bigger than life but, at times, better.&quot; For her performance, she was nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television film.

===1996–2002: Independent films and producing===

In 1996, Griffith co-starred with Antonio Banderas in the comedy &quot;Two Much&quot;. She and Banderas began a relationship during the film&#x27;s production, and were married that year. After their respective divorces were finalized, Griffith and Banderas married on May 14, 1996, at Marylebone Town Hall in London. Their daughter, Stella del Carmen Banderas, was born on September 24, 1996. Following &quot;Two Much&quot;, Griffith starred in the neo-noir &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; (1996), playing the wife of a Los Angeles police detective (played by Nick Nolte), a performance that won her the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. Critics such as Roger Ebert praised the film as &quot;the kind of movie where every note is put in lovingly. It&#x27;s a 1950s crime movie, but with a modern, ironic edge,&quot; but the film was a box office flop.

Griffith was cast in the role of Charlotte Haze in Adrian Lyne&#x27;s 1997 adaptation of &quot;Lolita&quot;, opposite Jeremy Irons. The film received a brief theatrical run and was subsequently shown on television, and grossed only $1.1 million against a $62 million budget. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Griffith was &quot;ideally cast as the annoying, widowed Charlotte. With her garish red nails, her screeching voice, her affected diction, Charlotte seems unbearable to the professorial Humbert.&quot; In 1998, Griffith had a supporting part playing a famous actress in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998), a performance characterized by critic Peter Travers as &quot;playfully lusty&quot;. She followed this with a starring role as a free-spirited heroin addict in Larry Clark&#x27;s independent film &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, opposite James Woods. Roger Ebert praised the performances, writing: &quot;Woods and Griffith play types they&#x27;ve played before, but with a zest and style that brings the movie alive--especially in the earlier scenes, before everything gets clouded by doom.&quot;

On February 5, 1999, Griffith made her stage debut at the Old Vic in London, England, where she acted with Cate Blanchett in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. The same year, she starred in &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot;, a film directed by Banderas and produced by Greenmoon Productions, the company that Banderas and she formed together. In the film, Griffith played an eccentric woman in 1960s Alabama who kills her husband and heads to Hollywood to become a movie star; this plot is set against a subplot involving a race-related murder. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Griffith manages to make Barbra Streisand look downright camera-shy,&quot; but criticized its dual plots, writing that the &quot;juxtapositions are not merely preposterous, but downright tasteless. Worse yet, they unintentionally trivialize the civil rights movement by aligning it with a ding-dong belle&#x27;s tenuous connection with the women&#x27;s movement.&quot; This sentiment was echoed by Paul Clinton of CNN, who wrote: &quot;The deadly serious Alabama plot line of &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; is much more interesting than Griffith&#x27;s wacky, comic cross-country trip. These dueling stories result in a film that&#x27;s oddly uneven and unlikely to generate big box-office numbers.&quot; This was followed by a role in the HBO television film &quot;RKO 281&quot;, in which Griffith portrayed 1920s and 1930s movie star Marion Davies. For her performance, she received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

In 1999, Griffith was cast as Honey Whitlock, an arrogant actress kidnapped by a gang of underground filmmakers, in John Waters&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot;. Speaking on her being cast, Waters commented that Griffith possessed &quot;a combination of a good sense of humor and a little bit of defiance. Like me, she&#x27;s someone with a past who has made peace with it. Nobody can blackmail her. So she&#x27;s happy.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote of that while the film&#x27;s jokes are &quot;hit-and-miss,&quot; Griffith &quot;has a ball tweaking her diva image&quot;. Also in 2000, Griffith acted opposite Patrick Swayze in &quot;Forever Lulu&quot;, in which she portrayed a schizophrenic woman attempting to contact her son. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film, referring to it as &quot;a straight-to-vidbin stiff...  this wannabe romantic comedy is chock full of phony sentiment.&quot;

In November 2000, Griffith returned to drug rehabilitation for treatment of a painkiller addiction. While in treatment, Griffith began making public blog posts in an online journal detailing her battle to beat her substance abuse. She wrote in her first post: &quot;I am starting this recovery journal because I wanted to share with you my experiences. I am still a little shaky, but I feel it is important that I share this with you, because an addiction to prescribed pain pills can happen to anyone, and you have to be careful.&quot; Griffith had a minor role in the 2001-released youth-oriented independent film &quot;Tart&quot;, which she co-produced with Banderas under their Green Moon Productions company. The film starred Griffith&#x27;s former &quot;Lolita&quot; co-star Dominique Swain, as well as Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips, and Mischa Barton. In 2002, she voiced the character of Margalo the bird in the animated film &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot;.

===2003–2012: Theater and television===

In August 2003, Griffith made her Broadway debut playing Roxie Hart in a run of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;. The run was a box-office success. Though Griffith was previously untrained in song and dance, she still impressed &quot;New York Times&quot; theater critic Ben Brantley, who wrote: &quot;Ms. Griffith is a sensational Roxie, possibly the most convincing I have seen&quot; and &quot;[the] vultures who were expecting to see Ms. Griffith stumble...will have to look elsewhere.&quot; Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; noted some weaknesses in Griffith&#x27;s performance, such as her singing and dancing abilities, but conceded: 

She returned to the stage in 2012 in a play written by Scott Caan, titled &quot;No Way Around but Through,&quot; in which she played his mother. She played Caan&#x27;s mother again during 2014–16 in a recurring role on his television show &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. In 2016, she filmed with Caan&#x27;s father James Caan and Jon Voight in a TV movie titled &quot;J.L. Ranch&quot;.

Prior to &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, Griffith&#x27;s television work included the short-lived WB sitcom &quot;Twins&quot; (2005–06), and the 2007 series &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot;, which was canceled after two episodes.

In August 2009, Griffith returned to rehabilitation again for what her publicist called &quot;part of a routine plan&quot;. She had a three-month stay. In December of that year, Griffith had surgery to remove skin cancer.

Her 2012 television pilot, &quot;This American Housewife&quot; (produced by Banderas), was not picked up by Lifetime. In the interim, Griffith guest-starred on &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; and &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;.

===2013–present: Return to film===
In June 2014, Griffith and Banderas released a statement announcing their intention to divorce &quot;in a loving and friendly manner&quot;. According to the petition filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, the couple had &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; that led to the divorce. In December 2015, their divorce was finalized. Banderas has stated that he will always love Griffith, and Griffith appeared alongside Banderas in the 2014 science-fiction film &quot;Autómata&quot;, which they filmed amid their divorce proceedings. She then had a role in &quot;Day Out of Days&quot; (2015), directed by Zoe Cassavetes. In 2016, she signed to be a guest star on Hulu&#x27;s &quot;The Path&quot;.

In 2017, Griffith costarred opposite Al Pacino and Evan Peters in &quot;The Pirates of Somalia&quot; (originally titled &quot;Where the White Man Runs Away&quot;), a biopic about journalist Jay Bahadur; and played Jean Shelton in James Franco&#x27;s &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot;, a comedy based on Greg Sestero&#x27;s book of the same name. In mid-2018, Griffith played Mrs. Robinson in a stage version of &quot;The Graduate&quot; at the Laguna Playhouse in California. In August 2018, she revealed she had undergone further and &quot;final&quot; surgical treatments to remove skin cancer from her face.

==Philanthropy==
Griffith supports the efforts of Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles helping to lead Walk for Kids, a community 5K, to raise funds as part of the hospital&#x27;s community awareness efforts in support of the opening of a new state-of-the-art pediatric inpatient facility. She also participated in the hospital&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Noche de Niños&quot; gala as a presenter of a Courage to Care Award.

<text>Malèna is a 2000 erotic drama film written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore from a story by Luciano Vincenzoni. It stars Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro. The film won the Grand Prix at the 2001 Cabourg Film Festival. At the 73rd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Original Score.

==Plot==
On 10 June 1940, in the small Sicilian town of Castelcutò, a teenage boy named Renato experiences three major events: Italy enters World War II; he receives a new bike; and he first sees the beautiful and sensual Malèna, who is the most desired young woman in town. Her husband is in the armed forces fighting the British in Africa, and she lives alone. Because of her beauty and solitary status, she is an object of lust for all the town&#x27;s men and of hatred for its women. She keeps an eye on her infirm old father who lives alone, until he gets an anonymous note slandering her, which causes him to reject her.

Renato becomes obsessed with Malena, spying on her in her house and stalking her when she leaves it. To fuel his erotic fantasies, he steals some of her underwear from her clothes line. When his parents find it in his bedroom, they become upset and try to break his fixation.

Malèna gets the news that her husband has been killed, adding grief to her isolation. Rumours grow around her, which she unwisely fuels by allowing an unmarried air force officer to visit her after dark. When she is denounced and put on trial, the officer sends testimony that he was nothing more than an occasional friend. The betrayal hurts, but Malèna says nothing to condemn him. After her acquittal, her lawyer pays her a visit and rapes her.

Renato decides to be Malèna&#x27;s protector, asking God and his saints to watch over her and performing little acts of vengeance against her detractors. He does not realise that his views of her are little better than those of the townspeople, and he has no idea how Malèna herself feels.

Meanwhile, the war reaches Sicily and the town is bombed by the Allies, killing her father. Now penniless and universally scorned, with nobody willing to give her work, she sinks into prostitution. The townsfolk are happy to see her as a whore rather than a dangerous widow. When Nazi forces occupy the town and Renato encounters his idol with two German soldiers, he faints. His mother believes it is demonic possession, taking him to a priest for exorcism, but his father takes him to the town brothel. There he fantasises that the prostitute he has sex with is Malèna.

The Germans leave, and American troops enter the town, welcomed by ecstatic cheers. The women storm the hotel and drag out Malèna, ripping off her clothes, beating her and cutting off her hair. To escape further persecution, she leaves the hostile town. A few days later, her husband Nino, who has survived as a prisoner of war but lost an arm, comes back looking for her. His house has been taken over by displaced people and nobody wants to tell him how to find his wife. Renato leaves him an anonymous note saying that she still loves him but has suffered misfortunes and gone to the city of Messina.

A year later, Nino and Malèna return and are seen strolling through the town. Women notice she now looks more matronly and plain. Even if she is still beautiful, since she is now married and living with her husband, they realize that she is no longer a threat. So people begin speaking of her with more respect. When she goes to the market, the women who beat her say good morning and call her madam. Walking home, some fruit falls from her bag and Renato rushes to pick it up. He wishes her good luck and she gives him an enigmatic half-smile, the only time either has ever spoken to or looked openly at the other.

The aged Renato reflects that he has known and loved many women and has forgotten all of them, but he has never forgotten about Malèna.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54% based on reviews from 78 critics, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Malena&quot; ends up objectifying the character of the movie&#x27;s title. Also, the young boy&#x27;s emotional investment with Malena is never convincing, as she doesn&#x27;t feel like a three-dimensional person.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Considerably scaled down in scope and size from his English-language existential epic, &quot;The Legend of 1900&quot;, Giuseppe Tornatore&#x27;s &quot;Malena&quot; is a beautifully crafted but slight period drama that chronicles a 13-year-old boy&#x27;s obsession with a small-town siren in World War II Sicily. Combining a coming-of-age story with the sad odyssey of a woman punished for her beauty, the film ultimately has too little depth, subtlety, thematic consequence or contemporary relevance to make it a strong contender for arthouse crossover. But its erotic elements and nostalgic evocation of the same vanished Italy that made international hits of &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; and &quot;Il Postino&quot; could supply commercial leverage.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert compared the film to Federico Fellini&#x27;s work, writing, &quot;Fellini&#x27;s films often involve adolescents inflamed by women who embody their carnal desires (e.g. &quot;Amarcord&quot; and &quot;8½&quot;). But Fellini sees the humor that underlies sexual obsession, except (usually but not always) in the eyes of the participants. &quot;Malena&quot; is a simpler story, in which a young man grows up transfixed by a woman and essentially marries himself to the idea of her. It doesn&#x27;t help that the movie&#x27;s action grows steadily gloomier, leading to a public humiliation that seems wildly out of scale with what has gone before and to an ending that is intended to move us much more deeply, alas, than it can.&quot;

<text>The N22 road is a national primary road in Ireland which goes through counties Kerry and Cork, from Tralee in the west through Killarney, Macroom and Ballincollig to Cork City Centre in the east.

== Improvements ==
Sections of the N22 were upgraded in the late 20th and early 21st century. During the 1980s and 1990s, a section between Killarney and the border with County Cork was rebuilt and widened. An auxiliary climbing lane has been provided on the steep grade sections. The late 1980s saw a bypass of Killarney. In 2004, the Ballincollig bypass in the west of Cork city was completed. This is an dual carriageway road built to motorway standards that connects with the N40 Cork South Ring Road. In 2005, of the road between Tralee and Farranfore was upgraded. This added to a section opened in 2002. In August 2013, a new section of road was added as part of the Tralee N22/N69 bypass project at Ballingrelagh replacing the section of road where the N22 originally ended at the N21 John Cronin Roundabout in Ballycarty. The N22 now terminates at Camp Roundabout outside Tralee on the N22/N69 Tralee Bypass. 

In 2020 works began on a new Baile Bhuirne – Macroom bypass to ease congestion through Macroom. The first phase of the project opened in December 2022, with phases 2 and 3 opened in August and in November 2023 respectively.

== Route ==
The N22 between Killarney and Cork via Macroom is the N71 which goes through Kenmare, Glengarriff, Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and finally Bandon.

==Planned upgrades==
Four major projects are in planning for the N22:
*Killarney – Farranfore
*Macroom to Ballincollig rebuild
* Cork Northern Ring Road, connecting with M8 junction 18. (Likely to be designated as N40).
Additionally there are proposals for 2+1 road upgrades to the Killarney – Ballyvourney section. The Farranfore – Killarney and Ballyvourney – Macroom schemes are to be developed as 2 plus 1 roads also. The Cork Northern Ring Road is currently in planning, and consists of of dual carriageway. Part of the Cork Northern Ring Road scheme would be designated motorway.

It is famous for &quot;The Sculpture Road to Killarney&quot; where the internationally respected sculptor, Tighe O&#x27;Donoghue/Ross of Glenflesk and his son, Eoghan, were commissioned to place sculpted stones along the new part of the road between Killarney and the county bounds to Cork. Most of the stones were excavated during the building of the road, varying between one and three tons in weight. The most popular sculpture is that of a rearing horse, set atop a rise along the road near Clonkeen. Made from ferro-cement over a steel infrastructure, An Capall Mór, the race horse, is accoutered with a helmet featuring a unicorn horn, typical of the war horses used by the Celtic chiefs during their battles. There are broken chains around its front legs, signifying freedom.

<doc id="484109" wikidata="Q5164178" url="?curid=484109" title="1997 Constitution of Fiji">
<text>The 1997 Constitution of Fiji was the supreme law of Fiji from its adoption in 1997 until 2009 when President Josefa Iloilo purported to abrogate it. It was also suspended for a period following the 2000 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; led by George Speight.

== Background ==

The Constitution of the Republic of the Fiji Islands dates from 1997. It is Fiji&#x27;s third Constitution. The first, adopted in 1970 upon independence, was abrogated following two military coups in 1987. A second constitution was adopted in 1990. Its discriminatory provisions, which reserved the office of Prime Minister and a built-in majority in the House of Representatives for indigenous Fijians (although they were at that time a minority of the population) proved very unpopular with the Indo-Fijian community, which comprised almost half the country&#x27;s population, and in the mid 1990s the government agreed that it should be rewritten.

== Constitutional process ==
In 1995, President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara appointed a three-member Constitutional Review Commission. The commissioners were Tomasi Vakatora, an ethnic Fijian, and Brij Lal, an Indo-Fijian, with Sir Paul Reeves, a former Governor-General of New Zealand, as chairman. Fourteen months of consultations followed. The Commission finally presented its report, containing 697 recommendations, to the President on 6 September 1996. The report was subsequently tabled in Parliament, at a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, on 11 September. A parliamentary committee, composed of members of both chambers, was established to study the report.

Eight months later, the committee tabled its response in Parliament on 14 May 1997, endorsing most of the recommendations. The Great Council of Chiefs, a powerful gathering of mainly high chiefs which, among other prerogatives, elects the President of Fiji, also endorsed the report in June. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill 1997 was passed by the House of Representatives on 3 July that year, and by the Senate on 10 July. President Mara signed it into law on 25 July 1997. It took effect from 27 July. Under its provisions, ethnic Fijians agreed to give up their guaranteed majority in the House of Representatives and their monopoly on the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, but in return, their ownership of most of the land was written into the constitution. Their rights were also protected by institutionalising of the Great Council of Chiefs, which retained its power to elect the President and 14 of the 32 Senators.

The 1997 constitution was only the second national constitution to explicitly protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation (section 38). The first one was South Africa&#x27;s in 1996.

== 2000 and 2006 coups, 2009 abrogation ==
The 1997 constitution was abrogated by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who organised a counter-coup to neutralise a civilian coup d&#x27;état led by George Speight, and subsequently formed an Interim Military Government. A Supreme Court decision in November, however, reinstated the constitution, and new parliamentary elections under it were held in September 2001.

On 5 December 2006, the Military again overthrew the government. Commodore Bainimarama, who once again became acting Head of State, stated that the Constitution would remain in effect, but said on 17 December that &quot;as a last resort&quot;, it could be abrogated if no other way could be found to ensure immunity from prosecution for soldiers involved in the takeover.

In the April 2009 crisis, President Josefa Iloilo suspended the Constitution and dismissed all judges after the Court of Appeal ruled the military government from 2006 illegal.

== Document ==
The Fijian Constitution comprises seventeen chapters. The links in the index on this page are to articles summarising their contents, along with the interpretation and the historical background, including reasons for their provision. Ongoing controversies are also noted.

== Amendments ==
At the end of September 2005, the government introduced legislation to amend the Constitution so as to allow parliamentarians and other senior government officials to serve as members of Provincial Councils, the Fijian Affairs Board, or the Great Council of Chiefs. Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase told the House of Representatives that the amendments, to which the Opposition Fiji Labour Party had agreed at the Tanaloa Talks in 2003, were necessary to allow chiefs to hold multiple positions if their subjects so wished.

In 2005, several prominent figures were affected by the constitutional ban on politicians holding other public offices. These included Ro Teimumu Kepa, the Paramount Chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy, who was required to relinquish her chairmanship of the Rewa Provincial Council, which was deemed to be incompatible with her position as a member of the House of Representatives and as a Cabinet Minister.

Even though the Labour Party agreed to the amendments in 2003, it has indicated that it will oppose them now. The FLP is bitterly opposed to other government legislation, such as the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill which may be passed with a simple majority, and it is thought that its stated intention to oppose these amendments, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses, may be a ploy to force the government to negotiate on the Unity Bill.

==New Constitution for 2013==
In July 2009, following the suspension of the Constitution in April, interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama announced that Fiji would have a new Constitution—its fourth—by 2013. It would remove the ethnic-based provisions of the electoral system. The voting age would be lowered to 18, and the number of seats in Parliament, as well as the &quot;need for a Senate&quot;, would be reviewed during the preparatory phase. The new Constitution would derive from the People&#x27;s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress, and from &quot;extensive&quot; consultations with political parties, non-governmental organisations and ordinary citizens.

<doc id="484111" wikidata="Q5164190" url="?curid=484111" title="Preamble to the 1997 Constitution of Fiji">
<text>The 1997 Constitution of Fiji begins with a Preamble, which sets out the historical, cultural, and political reasons for the drafting of the 1997 Constitution.

The writing of the Preamble was a careful balancing act. Fijian society has often been culturally, economically, and politically polarized in recent decades between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians, who are descendants of migrants brought to work the British-owned sugar plantations between 1879 and 1916. The framers of the Constitution wanted the Preamble to acknowledge the unique place of indigenous Fijians and Rotumans, whilst at the same time affirming the equal value to the country of Indo-Fijians and other minorities.

The Preamble recalls &quot;the events in our history that have made us what we are.&quot; It begins by asking for the continued blessing of God &quot;who has always watched over these islands&quot;, and goes on to acknowledge the strong Christian tradition of the Fijian people, dating from &quot;their conversion from heathenism through the power of the name of Jesus Christ&quot; and speaks of the &quot;enduring influence&quot; of the Christian faith in Fiji today. Mindful, however, of Fiji&#x27;s complex history of immigration which has resulted in the multicultural nature of the Fijian nation today, the Preamble also acknowledges the &quot;contribution ... of other faiths, to the spiritual life of Fiji.&quot;

The Preamble traces Fiji&#x27;s constitutional history, from its settlement by the ancestors of the Fijian and Rotuman peoples and the subsequent arrival of numerous different peoples, through the decision of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the King who had united all of Fiji&#x27;s tribes under his leadership in 1871, and his subsequent decision to cede the country to Great Britain on 10 October 1874, and the later decision of the Rotuman chiefs to cede Rotuma in November 1879, to the gaining of independence from the United Kingdom and the adoption of the first constitution in 1970, the abrogation of that constitution in 1987, and the subsequent proclamation of the Sovereign Democratic Republic of Fiji and the promulgation of a republican constitution by the President, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, in 1990, and the subsequent constitutional review undertaken in the mid-1990s, leading to the adoption of the present document. &quot;The Preamble sees an unbroken continuity connecting all of these historical events that have left their mark on Fiji&#x27;s constitutional history.&quot;

The Preamble goes on to recognize that &quot;all those who chose to make their homes in these islands form our multicultural society,&quot; and recognizes the value and worth of the diverse faiths, traditions, languages, and cultures of the various ethnic components of Fiji&#x27;s society. Pride is expressed in the common citizenship, institutions, and development of Fiji&#x27;s people groups. The preamble ends with a new commitment, &quot;with God as our witness,&quot; to live in harmony and unity, promote social justice, further economic and social development benefiting all communities, protect human rights and uphold the rule of law, and safeguard the importance of the family unit.</text><links>

<doc id="484113" wikidata="Q40769" url="?curid=484113" title="Crash! Boom! Bang!">
<text>Crash! Boom! Bang! is the fifth studio album by Swedish pop rock duo Roxette, released on 11 April 1994 by EMI. The album was an immediate commercial success, peaking within the top 10 in over 20 national charts throughout Europe, Australasia and South America. The full-length album was not originally released in the United States, where a shortened version titled &quot;Favorites from Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; was sold for a limited time through McDonald&#x27;s outlets; this version sold over a million copies in the US but was deemed ineligible to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 as, until 2007, &quot;Billboard&quot; had a policy of excluding albums sold by an exclusive retailer.

Five singles were released from the album: lead single &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot; became the duo&#x27;s second number one in their home country, and peaked at number seven on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s European Hot 100 Singles. It would become the duo&#x27;s final track to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number 50, and was also their last hit single in Australia. This was followed by the release of &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;, &quot;Fireworks&quot;, &quot;Run to You&quot; and &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. As of 2001, &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; has sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide. Japanese editions included &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; as a bonus track.

==Release and promotion==
Prior to &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;″s international release, a shorter version of the album was released by CEMA for a limited time exclusively through outlets of the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant chain in the US. &quot;Favorites from Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; sold over a million copies, the proceeds of which were used to fund Ronald McDonald House Charities programs for the health and well-being of children. This CD was sold at below normal wholesale cost, and the promotion angered traditional music retailers, who claimed that it devalued music. This edition of the record was the subject of a 1998 lawsuit filed against an Uppsala-based music production company by Roxette and their Swedish record label. The duo and their label alleged that J.G.S. Skivproduktion illegally imported 40,000 copies of &quot;Favorites from Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; into the EU. Rather than seek monetary damages, the duo requested the destruction of all remaining copies.

The record was released globally from 11 April 1994 on CD, cassette and vinyl formats. Japanese editions included &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; as a bonus track—the song had previously been released as a non-album single on the soundtrack of the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) motion picture. Despite a tentative &quot;early summer&quot; release date being set for the US, the full-length album would not see release there until it was reissued globally with bonus tracks in 2009. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the full-length album sold 46,000 copies in the US as of 2005, as an import-release. The band toured extensively to promote the record, the &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang! Tour&quot; saw them perform to over a million people. Roxette became the first western act since Wham! in 1985 to stage a concert in communist China, performing to over 15,000 people at the Workers Indoor Arena. The tour concluded on 1 May 1995 in Moscow, with Roxette becoming the first act since 1917 to hold a concert on that date—a public holiday in Russia. As of 2001, the album has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.

Five singles were released from the album. &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot; served as its lead single, and was an immediate commercial success throughout Europe. The song debuted at number one in Sweden, and peaked within the top 20 of national charts in numerous territories: namely Austria, Benelux, Germany, Ireland, Scandinavia, Spain and the UK. It went on to peak at number seven on European Hot 100 Singles. The song was serviced to US radio stations from 2 June, and would be the duo&#x27;s final track to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 50. &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;, &quot;Fireworks&quot; and &quot;Run to You&quot; were released as subsequent singles, each with varying degrees of success. &quot;Vulnerable&quot; concomitantly served as both &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;″s fifth and final single and lead single from the band&#x27;s 1995 compilation &quot;Rarities&quot;. The album was released exclusively in South America and Asia, and compiled previously unreleased demos and remixes, as well as songs from the band&#x27;s 1993 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; set.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed reviews from the American music press. A writer for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was critical of the album&#x27;s ballads and mid-tempo songs, and complained that &quot;If only Per Gissle (sic) had let the charged-up Marie Fredriksson sing lead vocals on all 15 songs, &quot;Crash!&quot; might&#x27;ve qualified as an unqualified guilty pleasure.&quot; &quot;People&quot; expressed a similar sentiment: complimenting the scope and diversity of material found on the record, but said that &quot;As with the duo&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; hits its best notes when Fredriksson is at the mike&quot;, and said that her vocals were &quot;more subtle and graceful than [ever]&quot;. Although a review for AllMusic complimented the duo&#x27;s vocals and songwriting, they lamented the album as being &quot;too pop for rock listeners and too rock for mid-&#x27;90s pop fans.&quot; Conversely, Jean Rosenbluth of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the album&#x27;s inclusion of harder rock influences, complimenting the &quot;deliciously overwrought ballads, bubblegum and great almost-grunge.&quot; &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; stated that &quot;The world champions of pop rock are defending their title in style with this 15-single jukebox, a fifty fifty balance between rockers (&quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot;) and ballads (&quot;Place Your Love&quot; and the title track).

<doc id="484117" wikidata="Q3283875" url="?curid=484117" title="Glob (programming)">
<text>glob() () is a libc function for globbing, which is the archetypal use of pattern matching against the names in a filesystem directory such that a name pattern is expanded into a list of names matching that pattern. Although &quot;globbing&quot; may now refer to glob()-style pattern matching of any string, not just expansion into a list of filesystem names, the original meaning of the term is still widespread.

The codice_1 function and the underlying codice_2 function originated at Bell Labs in the early 1970s alongside the original AT&amp;T UNIX itself and had a formative influence on the syntax of UNIX command line utilities and therefore also on the present-day reimplementations thereof. 

In their original form, codice_1 and codice_2 derived from code used in Bell Labs in-house utilities that developed alongside the original Unix in the early 1970s. Among those utilities were also two command line tools called codice_5 and codice_6; each could be used to pass a list of matching filenames to other command line tools, and they shared the backend code subsequently formalized as codice_1 and codice_2. Shell-statement-level globbing by default became commonplace following the &quot;builtin&quot;-integration of globbing-functionality into the 7th edition of the Unix shell in 1978. The Unix shell&#x27;s -f option to disable globbing — i.e. revert to literal &quot;file&quot; mode — appeared in the same version.

The glob &quot;pattern quantifiers&quot; now standardized by POSIX.2 (IEEE Std 1003.2) fall into two groups, and can be applied to any character sequence (&quot;string&quot;), not just to directory entries.
* &quot;Metacharacters&quot; (also called &quot;Wildcards&quot;):
** codice_9 (not in brackets) matches any character exactly once.
** codice_10 (not in brackets) matches a string of zero or more characters.
* &quot;Ranges/sets&quot;:
** codice_11, where the first character within the brackets is not &#x27;!&#x27;, matches any single character among the characters specified in the brackets. If the first character within brackets is &#x27;!&#x27;, then the codice_12 matches any single character that is &quot;not&quot; among the characters specified in the brackets.
:: The characters in the brackets may be a list (codice_13) or a range (codice_14) or denote a character class (like codice_15 where the inner brackets are part of the classname). POSIX does not mandate multi-range (codice_16) support, which derive originally from regular expressions.

As reimplementations of Bell Labs&#x27; UNIX proliferated, so did reimplementations of its Bell Labs&#x27; libc and shell, and with them codice_1 and &quot;globbing&quot;. Today, codice_1 and &quot;globbing&quot; are standardized by the POSIX.2 specification and are integral part of every Unix-like libc ecosystem and shell, including AT&amp;T Bourne shell-compatible Korn shell (ksh), Z shell (zsh), Almquist shell (ash) and its derivatives and reimplementations such as busybox, toybox, GNU bash, Debian dash.

==Origin==
The glob command, short for &quot;global&quot;, originates in the earliest versions of Bell Labs&#x27; Unix. The command interpreters of the early versions of Unix (1st through 6th Editions, 1969–1975) relied on a separate program to expand wildcard characters in unquoted arguments to a command: &quot;/etc/glob&quot;. That program performed the expansion and supplied the expanded list of file paths to the command for execution.

Glob was originally written in the B programming language. It was the first piece of mainline Unix software to be developed in a high-level programming language. Later, this functionality was provided as a C library function, codice_1, used by programs such as the shell. It is usually defined based on a function named codice_20, which tests for whether a string matches a given pattern - the program using this function can then iterate through a series of strings (usually filenames) to determine which ones match. Both functions are a part of POSIX: the functions defined in POSIX.1 since 2001, and the syntax defined in POSIX.2. The idea of defining a separate match function started with wildmat (wildcard match), a simple library to match strings against Bourne Shell globs.

Traditionally, globs do not match hidden files in the form of Unix dotfiles; to match them the pattern must explicitly start with codice_21. For example, codice_10 matches all visible files while codice_23 matches all hidden files.

==Syntax==

The most common wildcards are , , and .

Normally, the path separator character ( on Linux/Unix, MacOS, etc. or on Windows) will never be matched. Some shells, such as Unix shell have functionality allowing users to circumvent this.

===Unix-like===

On Unix-like systems , is defined as above while has two additional meanings:

The ranges are also allowed to include pre-defined character classes, equivalence classes for accented characters, and collation symbols for hard-to-type characters. They are defined to match up with the brackets in POSIX regular expressions.

Unix globbing is handled by the shell per POSIX tradition. Globbing is provided on filenames at the command line and in shell scripts. The POSIX-mandated codice_24 statement in shells provides pattern-matching using glob patterns.

Some shells (such as the C shell and Bash) support additional syntax known as alternation or brace expansion. Because it is not part of the glob syntax, it is not provided in codice_24. It is only expanded on the command line before globbing.

The Bash shell also supports the following extensions:
* Extended globbing (extglob): allows other pattern matching operators to be used to match multiple occurrences of a pattern enclosed in parentheses, essentially providing the missing kleene star and alternation for describing regular languages. It can be enabled by setting the shell option. This option came from ksh93. The GNU fnmatch and glob has an identical extension.
* globstar: allows codice_26 on its own as a name component to recursively match any number of layers of non-hidden directories. Also supported by the JavaScript libraries and Python&#x27;s glob.

===Windows and DOS===

The original DOS was a clone of CP/M designed to work on Intel&#x27;s 8088 and 8086 processors. Windows shells, following DOS, do not traditionally perform any glob expansion in arguments passed to external programs. Shells may use an expansion for their own builtin commands:

* Windows PowerShell has all the common syntax defined as stated above without any additions.
* COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe have most of the common syntax with some limitations: There is no and for COMMAND.COM the may only appear at the end of the pattern. It can not appear in the middle of a pattern, except immediately preceding the filename extension separator dot.

Windows and DOS programs receive a long command-line string instead of argv-style parameters, and it is their responsibility to perform any splitting, quoting, or glob expansion. There is technically no fixed way of describing wildcards in programs since they are free to do what they wish. Two common glob expanders include:

* The Microsoft C Runtime (msvcrt) command-line expander, which only supports and . Both ReactOS (crt/misc/getargs.c) and Wine (msvcrt/data.c) contain a compatible open-source implementation of , the function operating under-the-hood, in their core CRT.
* The Cygwin and MSYS command-line expander, which uses the unix-style routine under-the-hood, after splitting the arguments.

Most other parts of Windows, including the Indexing Service, use the MS-DOS style of wildcards found in CMD. A relic of the 8.3 filename age, this syntax pays special attention to dots in the pattern and the text (filename). Internally this is done using three extra wildcard characters, . On the Windows API end, the equivalent is , and corresponds to its underlying . (Another fnmatch analogue is .) Both open-source msvcrt expanders use , so 8.3 filename quirks will also apply in them.

===SQL===
The SQL operator has an equivalent to and but not .

Standard SQL uses a glob-like syntax for simple string matching in its codice_27 operator, although the term &quot;glob&quot; is not generally used in the SQL community. The percent sign () matches zero or more characters and the underscore () matches exactly one.

Many implementations of SQL have extended the codice_27 operator to allow a richer pattern-matching language, incorporating character ranges (), their negation, and elements of regular expressions.

==Compared to regular expressions==
Globs do not include syntax for the Kleene star which allows multiple repetitions of the preceding part of the expression; thus they are not considered regular expressions, which can describe the full set of regular languages over any given finite alphabet.

Globs attempt to match the entire string (for example, matches S.DOC and SA.DOC, but not POST.DOC or SURREY.DOCKS), whereas, depending on implementation details, regular expressions may match a substring.

=== Implementing as regular expressions ===

The original Mozilla proxy auto-config implementation, which provides a glob-matching function on strings, uses a replace-as-RegExp implementation as above. The bracket syntax happens to be covered by regex in such an example.

Python&#x27;s fnmatch uses a more elaborate procedure to transform the pattern into a regular expression.

== Other implementations==
Beyond their uses in shells, globs patterns also find use in a variety of programming languages, mainly to process human input. A glob-style interface for returning files or an fnmatch-style interface for matching strings are found in the following programming languages:

* C and C++ do not have built-in support for glob patterns in the ISO-defined standard libraries, however on Unix-like systems C and C++ may include codice_29 from the C POSIX library to use codice_1. 
** C++ itself does not have direct support for glob patterns, however they may be approximated using the codice_31 and codice_32 headers, using codice_33 and codice_34.
* C# has multiple libraries available through NuGet such as codice_35 or codice_36.
* D has a codice_37 function in the codice_38 module.
* JavaScript has a library called codice_39 which is used internally by npm, and codice_40, a purportedly more optimized, accurate and safer globbing implementation used by Babel and yarn.
* Go has a codice_35 function in the codice_42 package.
* Java has a codice_43 class in the package codice_44, containing methods that can operate on glob patterns.
* Haskell has a codice_35 package with the main module codice_46. The pattern syntax is based on a subset of Zsh&#x27;s. It tries to optimize the given pattern and should be noticeably faster than a naïve character-by-character matcher.
* Perl has both a codice_5 function (as discussed in Larry Wall&#x27;s book &quot;Programming Perl&quot;) and a &quot;Glob&quot; extension which mimics the BSD glob routine. Perl&#x27;s angle brackets can be used to glob as well: codice_48.
* PHP has a codice_5 function.
* Python has a codice_5 module in the standard library which performs wildcard pattern matching on filenames, and an codice_51 module with functions for matching strings or filtering lists based on these same wildcard patterns. Guido van Rossum, author of the Python programming language, wrote and contributed a codice_5 routine to BSD Unix in 1986. There were previous implementations of codice_5, e.g., in the ex and ftp programs in previous releases of BSD.
* Ruby has a codice_5 method for the codice_55 class which performs wildcard pattern matching on filenames. Several libraries such as Rant and Rake provide a codice_56 class which has a glob method or use the method codice_57 identically.
* Rust has multiple libraries that can match glob patterns, the most popular of these being the codice_5 crate.
* SQLite has a codice_59 function.
* Tcl contains a globbing facility.

<text>Alfred James Lotka (March 2, 1880 – December 5, 1949) was a Polish-American mathematician, physical chemist, and statistician, famous for his work in population dynamics and energetics. A biophysicist, Lotka is best known for his proposal of the predator–prey model, developed simultaneously but independently of Vito Volterra. The Lotka–Volterra model is still the basis of many models used in the analysis of population dynamics in ecology.

==Life==
Lotka was born in Lwów, Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine) to Polish-American parents. His parents, Jacques and Marie (Doebely) Lotka, were US nationals. He gained his B.Sc. in 1901 at the University of Birmingham, England, he did graduate work in 1901–02 at Leipzig University, received an M.A. in 1909 at Cornell University and a D.Sc. at Birmingham University in 1912.

;Occupations
* Assistant chemist for General Chemical Company (1902–1908, 1914–1919)
* Patent examiner for US Patent Office (1909)
* Assistant physicist for National Bureau of Standards (1909–1911)
* Editor of the &quot;Scientific American Supplement&quot; (1911–1914)
* Staff member at Johns Hopkins University (1922–1924)
* Statistician for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York City (1924 until his retirement in 1948)

In 1935, he married Romola Beattie. They had no children.

He died in Red Bank, New Jersey.

== Work ==

Although he is today known mainly for the Lotka–Volterra equations used in ecology, Lotka was a bio-mathematician and a bio-statistician, who sought to apply the principles of the physical sciences to biological sciences as well. His main interest was demography, which possibly influenced his professional choice as a statistician at Metropolitan Life Insurance.

One of Lotka&#x27;s earliest publications, in 1912, proposed a solution to Ronald Ross&#x27;s second malaria model. In 1923, he published a thorough five-part analysis and extension of both Ross&#x27;s malaria models. The fourth part in the series, co-authored by F. R. Sharpe, modeled the time lag for pathogen incubation. Lotka published &quot;Elements of Physical Biology&quot; in 1925, one of the first books on mathematical biology after D&#x27;Arcy Thompson&#x27;s &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;. He is also known for his energetics perspective on evolution. Lotka proposed that natural selection was, at its root, a struggle among organisms for available energy; Lotka&#x27;s principle states that organisms that survive and prosper are those that capture and use energy more efficiently than their competitors. Lotka extended his energetics framework to human society. In particular, he suggested that the shift in reliance from solar energy to nonrenewable energy would pose unique and fundamental challenges to society. These theories made Lotka an important forerunner to the development of biophysical economics and ecological economics, advanced by Frederick Soddy, Howard Odum and others.

=== Elements of physical biology ===
While at Johns Hopkins, Lotka completed his book &quot;Elements of Physical Biology&quot; (1925), in which he extended the work of Pierre François Verhulst. His first book summarizes his previous work and organizes his ideas of unity and universality of physical laws, making his works accessible to other scientists. Although the book covered a large number of topics, from energetics of evolution (see below) to the physical nature of consciousness, the author is primarily known today for the Lotka–Volterra equation of population dynamics.

===Energetics of evolution===
His earlier work was centered on energetics and applications of thermodynamics in life sciences.

Lotka proposed the theory that the Darwinian concept of natural selection could be quantified as a physical law. The law that he proposed was that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. The general systems ecologist Howard T. Odum later applied Lotka&#x27;s proposal as a central guiding feature of his work in ecosystem ecology. Odum called Lotka&#x27;s law the maximum power principle.

===Demography and public health===
Lotka&#x27;s work in mathematical demography began in 1907 with the publication of articles in the journal &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;American Journal of Science&quot;. He published several dozen articles on the subject over more than two decades, culminating with &quot;Théorie Analytique des Associations Biologiques&quot; (Analytical Theory of Biological Associations). The 45-page Part 1, titled &quot;Principes&quot;, was published in 1934; the 149-page Part 2, titled &quot;Analyse demographique avec application particuliere a l&#x27;espece humaine&quot;, was published in 1939; both by Hermann &amp; Cie, Paris.

===Bibliometrics===
Within the field of bibliometrics, particularly that part devoted to studying scientific publications, Lotka is noted for contributing &quot;Lotka&#x27;s law&quot;. The law, which Lotka discovered, relates to the productivity of scientists. As noted by W. G. Poitier in 1981: &quot;The Lotka distribution is based on an inverse square law where the number of authors writing &quot;n&quot; papers is 1/&quot;n&quot;2 of the number of authors writing one paper. Each subject area can have associated with it an exponent representing its specific rate of author productivity.&quot; Lotka&#x27;s work sparked additional inquiries, eventually seminally contributing to the field of scientometrics—the scientific study of scientific publications.

He teamed up with Louis Israel Dublin, another statistician at Metropolitan Life, to write three books on demography and public health: &quot;The Money Value of a Man&quot; (1930), &quot;Length of Life&quot; (1936), and &quot;Twenty-five Years of Health Progress&quot; (1937).

<doc id="484121" wikidata="Q1753192" url="?curid=484121" title="Have a Nice Day (Roxette album)">
<text>Have a Nice Day is the sixth studio album by Swedish pop duo Roxette, released worldwide from 22 February 1999 by Roxette Recordings and EMI. Recorded over an 18-month period in studios in Sweden and Spain, the album was produced by Marie Fredriksson, Per Gessle, Clarence Öfwerman and Michael Ilbert, and was their first studio album since &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; in 1994. The album was not released in the US, as the duo were no longer signed to a label there. A deluxe edition was released in Spanish-speaking territories and, in Arabian regions, the naked babies on the cover were digitally removed, due to religious concerns.

Gessle and Fredriksson separately recorded numerous demos for the album. These demos incorporated an elaborate level of production, using live instrumentation such as strings and brass instruments. The record features Fredriksson in a more prominent role than on any other Roxette album. She sings lead vocals on all but four of the album&#x27;s tracks, and it also contains the first Roxette song to be written and composed solely by her: &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot;. The album&#x27;s production style and aesthetic were inspired by some of Gessle&#x27;s favourite childhood recording artists, namely Phil Spector, John Lennon and Keith West.

Four singles were released from the album. &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot; was the most played song on European radio of 1999, and would also become their final top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart. Conversely, &quot;Anyone&quot; performed poorly on record charts, mainly because of its controversial, Jonas Åkerlund-directed music video, which was banned from airplay on MTV. In Japan, &quot;Anyone&quot; was issued as a double a-side with album track &quot;Pay the Price&quot;. Third single &quot;Stars&quot; became a top twenty hit across Europe, and was the album&#x27;s best performing single on the German Singles Chart. &quot;Salvation&quot; was issued as the final single.

The record was released to generally positive reviews, with several publications commending Roxette for incorporating a more diverse set of musical styles – namely alternative rock and electronica – into their usual pop rock sound. British magazine &quot;NME&quot; called it a &quot;clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock&quot;. Although not as successful as previous studio albums, it performed well commercially. Roxette won the &quot;Best Selling Scandinavian Artist/Group&quot; accolade at the 2000 World Music Awards. As of 2001, it had sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide. The album was remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in 2009, and was ultimately released on vinyl in 2019.

==Background and recording==

The album was recorded over an 18-month period in various studios, with sessions beginning in Spain in late 1997 and concluding in Sweden in October 1998. It was produced by Roxette members Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, their longtime producer Clarence Öfwerman, and mix engineer Michael Ilbert. Gessle worked meticulously on demos for the album at the Tits &amp; Ass recording studio in Halmstad—a studio which he co-founded in 1984 with his then-Gyllene Tider bandmate Mats &quot;MP&quot; Persson. According to Gessle, many of these demos would become &quot;full-fledged&quot; recordings: he would begin by tracking an acoustic guitar in stereo, before laying the foundation for the rest of the song. He and Persson would then incorporate electric guitars, keyboards, programming, live drums and percussion into the mix. Eventually, the quality of the demos progressed to the point where live strings were added. He said: &quot;Some of the songs I sing on the album, like &#x27;Crush on You&#x27; and &#x27;You Can&#x27;t Put Your Arms Around What&#x27;s Already Gone&#x27;, are very close to the original demos. I even kept the original vocals, because I feel I&#x27;m at my best when I&#x27;m doing demos.&quot;

&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; features Fredriksson in a more prominent role – both vocally and compositionally – than on any other Roxette album. Gessle sings lead vocals on four songs: the aforementioned two, as well as &quot;7Twenty7&quot; and &quot;Cooper&quot;, and sings the bridges of another two songs: &quot;Salvation&quot; and &quot;Pay the Price&quot;. All other tracks are sung entirely by Fredriksson. She was also much more involved in the album&#x27;s composition than on preceding releases. During the making of their 1991 album &quot;Joyride&quot;, Fredriksson indicated that her limited involvement in the writing of Roxette material stemmed from her difficulty in writing lyrics in English, saying that it &quot;feels very strange to write in another language.&quot; To combat this, Gessle gave Fredriksson several sets of lyrics to which she could compose music, with her version of &quot;Beautiful Things&quot; eventually being selected as the album closer. The record also contains the first Roxette song to be written and composed solely by Fredriksson: &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot;.

Alongside her husband, Mikael Bolyos, Fredriksson recorded numerous demos for the album at her home studio in Djursholm. Like the demos created by Gessle, Fredriksson&#x27;s recordings contained an elaborate level of production, incorporating live instrumentation such as piano, keyboards, drums, electronic organs and various brass instruments—namely tenor saxophones, trumpets, flugelhorns and trombones. Several of her demos have since been officially released: &quot;New World&quot; and &quot;Myth&quot; appeared as bonus tracks on the 2009 reissue of &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, and &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; featured among the bonus content on the reissue of their next studio album, &quot;Room Service&quot; (2001). A re-recorded Swedish version of &quot;Always the Last to Know&quot; (retitled &quot;Det som var nu&quot; and featuring Patrik Isaksson), was released as a single from her greatest hits compilation, &quot;Äntligen – Marie Fredrikssons bästa 1984–2000&quot;. A slightly re-recorded version of another track, &quot;Bad Moon&quot;, was later included on her 2004 English-language solo album &quot;The Change&quot;. The two remaining songs, &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;Do You Wanna Go With Me&quot;, remain unreleased, although all of these demos were leaked onto the internet in 2002 after a former member of EMI staff sold a bootleg CD at a Dutch record fair.

Gessle&#x27;s intention with the album was to create a modern-sounding, contemporary record that was inspired by the compositional style of his favourite childhood recording artists. He described &quot;Anyone&quot; as a &quot;big, old-fashioned ballad that is very much in the Phil Spector mode.&quot; He also said: &quot;I loved John Lennon&#x27;s &#x27;Instant Karma!&#x27; era, because it was sort of stark sounding, with dry tom-toms. On [&#x27;Salvation&#x27;], we tried to copy the piano sound from &#x27;Mother&#x27; [a track on 1970&#x27;s &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;]. I think it&#x27;s great to be able to go back into pop history like that.&quot; &quot;Stars&quot; juxtaposes techno beats with a children&#x27;s choir; Gessle had wanted to incorporate a children&#x27;s choir into one of his songs after hearing Keith West&#x27;s 1967 single &quot;Excerpt from A Teenage Opera&quot;. &quot;I Was So Lucky&quot; was written by Gessle in dedication to his son.

==Release and promotion==
Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the duo signed a lucrative new recording contract with their longterm label EMI. Under this new agreement, Fredriksson and Gessle, through their newly formed Roxette Recordings sub-label, obtained full control to the copyrights of their entire back-catalog – both their solo work and their work as Roxette – with the duo licensing their discography for a limited time back to EMI Sweden. Including &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, the deal would encompass three studio albums, with options for further albums afterwards. The duo also entered into negotiations with several record labels – namely RCA, Capitol and Epic – with respect to releasing both &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and their 1995 compilation &quot;Don&#x27;t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus! Roxette&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; in the United States. The latter had not been released there, as the relationship between Roxette and the North American branch of EMI collapsed shortly after the release of &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot; in 1994. &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; would remain unreleased in the US until the album was reissued globally with bonus tracks in 2009, although an updated and repackaged edition of the greatest hits compilation was released in 2000 by Edel Records.

&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; was released in Japan on 17 February 1999, in Spain on 22 February, and in Sweden three days later. A wider European release followed throughout March. In Spain, Portugal and parts of Latin America, a special edition of the album was released. This edition included Spanish versions of &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot;, &quot;Anyone&quot; and &quot;Salvation&quot; as bonus tracks. Its artwork also differed from other versions of the record, showing a blue-coloured floor instead of the standard edition&#x27;s pink one. In Arabian territories, the naked babies on the cover were digitally removed, due to religious concerns.

&quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot; was released as the lead single. It was a sizable hit for the duo, becoming the most played song on European radio of 1999. It peaked within the top twenty of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s European Hot 100 Singles. It would also become the duo&#x27;s final top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 11—their highest-charting single in the country since &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; reached number seven in 1993. Roxette performed the song at numerous high-profile events in the UK, including the annual televised Party in the Park concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park, and on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. &quot;Anyone&quot; was released as the second single, and performed poorly on record charts. Directed by long-time collaborator Jonas Åkerlund, the controversial video ends with a distressed Fredriksson attempting to commit suicide, and was banned by MTV. The poor performance of the song on European charts resulted in EMI UK refusing to release it as a commercial single there, despite already sending out promo CDs to radio DJs.

The third single to be released from the album was &quot;Stars&quot;. Its music video was directed by Anton Corbijn, and Fredriksson described making it as a &quot;hilarious experience&quot;—it featured her singing the song&#x27;s chorus to a raft of ducks. A techno-driven dance song, it became a top twenty hit across Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries. The song spent over three months on the German Singles Chart, peaking at number 23—their highest-charting single in Germany since &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot; reached number 11 in 1994. &quot;Salvation&quot; was released as the fourth and final single, which became a top twenty hit in Finland, but had little success elsewhere. The track &quot;It Will Take a Long Long Time&quot; was featured in the Julia Roberts and Richard Gere romantic comedy &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;, although it was not included on the soundtrack album. On its twentieth anniversary, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; was issued as a limited edition gatefold double LP yellow vinyl.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews upon release. Jason Damas of AllMusic commented on how the landscape of pop changed since the release of &quot;Crash! Boom! Bang!&quot;, saying: &quot;[Over those] five years, Britpop brought alternative rock back towards pop, electronica made dance music cool once more, and bubblegum like the Spice Girls made unabashed pop fun again. ... What resulted, then, was really rather ambitious: &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; is an effort to encapsulate Roxette&#x27;s trademark sound with Britpop and electronica and, by gosh, it works. It&#x27;s easily as good as any other Roxette album – save maybe only the stellar &quot;Joyride&quot; – and it shows that, artistically, the band is still on top.&quot; However, Damas also noted the &quot;presence of filler, mostly in the form of pace-destroying ballads&quot;, but said that was &quot;a small price to pay for the return of one of the best mainstream pop bands of the past decade.&quot; Similarly, a writer for &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;They don&#x27;t mess about, do these Roxette types. Nary 30 seconds into opening track &#x27;Crush on You&#x27;, we find them hollering &#x27;I&#x27;m messing with a neighbour/Who killed my amp and Fender/He looked so sweet and tender/It&#x27;s hard to tell his gender&#x27;. Snakes alive! What newfangled madness is this?&quot; They went on to call it a &quot;clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock&quot;, rating it four stars out of five.

Swedish journalist Håkan Pettersson, reviewing for &quot;Nerikes Allehanda&quot;, described the album as uneven, calling it &quot;predictable, but occasionally genius&quot;. He praised the singles and, in particular, the Fredriksson-composed tracks, describing &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot; as the best song on the record. He also complimented &quot;Beautiful Things&quot;, calling it &quot;symphonic&quot;. Retrospective commentary on the record has also been highly positive. A 2013 feature by Brendon Veevers of Renowned for Sound called the album underrated, and said that it &quot;should have catapulted Roxette back to [their commercial] peak&quot;, and that it contains &quot;some of the greatest ballads [in] the Roxette catalog&quot;. He praised its production, writing: &quot;Still to this day, I hear things that I hadn&#x27;t noticed before—whether it&#x27;s a subtle violin in the background, the pinging of a triangle, or a backing vocal placed carefully in the distance. The balance of vocals and instruments has been perfectly weighed&quot;. He also praised its consistency, saying that there &quot;isn&#x27;t one filler on &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;.&quot; Fred Bronson from &quot;Billboard&quot; rated it the 20th best album of the year.

==Commercial performance==
Although not as successful as previous studio albums, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; performed well commercially upon release. As of 2001, it has sold over 2.2 million copies worldwide. The success of the album saw Roxette win the &quot;Best Selling Scandinavian Artist/Group&quot; at the 2000 World Music Awards. The record was particularly successful in Scandinavia. It spent three weeks at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart, and went on to become the 18th best-selling album of the year in the country. It was certified platinum by the Swedish Recording Industry Association for sales in excess of 80,000 copies. It also debuted in the top ten in Denmark, Finland, and Norway, being certified platinum in both the latter territories (denoting shipments of over 20,000 and 50,000 units, respectively).

It was also a success throughout mainland Europe, debuting at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s European Top 100 Albums before rising to number two the following week. It reached number two in both Spain and Switzerland, and was certified platinum in both territories for shipments of over 100,000 and 50,000 units, respectively. The album also debuted at number two in Germany, behind Modern Talking&#x27;s &quot;Alone&quot;. It ended 1999 as the 29th best-selling album of the year in the country, and was certified gold by the BVMI for shipments of over 250,000 units. The record peaked at the top spot of the Belgian Albums Chart, and at number three in Austria.

However, the album underperformed in certain territories. Despite the success of &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot; there, the album stalled at number 28 of the UK Albums Chart–failing to emulate the top five success of all their previous albums. It also performed poorly in Australia, peaking at number 62. It debuted at number 19 in Japan, spending just three weeks on the Oricon chart. For unknown reasons, the album charted at number two on the Canadian Singles Chart, in the chart dated 17 July 1999, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;.

<text>A gay bathhouse, also known as a gay sauna or a gay steambath, is a public bath targeted towards gay and bisexual men. In gay slang, a bathhouse may be called just &quot;the baths&quot;, &quot;the sauna&quot;, or &quot;the tubs&quot;. Historically, they have been used for sexual activity.

Bathhouses offering similar services for women are rare, but some men&#x27;s bathhouses occasionally have a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;women only&quot; night. Some, such as Hawks PDX, offer so-called &quot;bisexual&quot; nights, where anyone is welcome regardless of gender.

Gay bathhouses differentiate themselves from similar gay sex clubs or gay bar darkrooms by offering communal and/or individual water facilities (and thus, a more sanitary experience). 

Bathhouses vary considerably in size and amenities—from small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms and a handful of lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, hot tubs, and sometimes swimming pools and private outdoor facilities. Most have a steam room (or wet sauna), dry sauna, showers, lockers, and small private rooms. 

Different cultures emphasize different uses of a gay bathhouse. In Asia, nearly every gay sauna includes a communal karaoke room complete with handheld microphones and large selections of songs for their toweled patrons. In Northern Europe, there are often small cafes or even restaurants offering full meals within a gay bathhouse. In North America, many gay bathhouses include a large dedicated gym area with weights and exercise machines.

In many countries, bathhouses are &quot;membership only&quot; (for legal reasons); though membership is generally open to anyone over the age of consent who seeks it, usually after paying a small fee. Unlike brothels, customers at gay bathhouses in the U.S. pay only for the use of the facilities. Sexual activity, if it occurs, is not provided by staff of the establishment, but is between customers with no money exchanged. Many gay bathhouses in the U.S., for legal reasons, explicitly prohibit and/or discourage prostitution and ban known prostitutes.

In other countries (notably Thailand, Switzerland, and Brazil), bathhouses may employ male prostitutes to work directly on site. Their availability may be blatant (patrons choose a numbered male who is viewable behind a partition), or subtle (male prostitutes may wear a towel and mix in as a general patron, but when approached will clarify they are solely &quot;for rent&quot;.) These men for hire may have access to private rooms in the establishment that are otherwise off-limits to general guests. Sex fees are typically set by the management, although tipping is encouraged. Private session lengths and costs may be tallied up as &quot;per song&quot; playing overhead on the bathhouse&#x27;s audio system. Since true male-only brothels are rarely found anywhere in the world, gay bathhouses sometimes also act as this hybrid model. However, unlike an actual brothel, patrons can choose to solely have sex with each other for free (without paying anything in addition to the price at the door).

==History==

Gay saunas have become important safe locations for men to meet and explore their sexuality, according to the LGBTQ+ community. These establishments first appeared in large European cities in the early 20th century, providing undercover and remote settings for same-sex interactions at a time when homosexuality was strongly stigmatized and illegal. A tradition of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of homosexual activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, adult theaters, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex among patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.

===Early records===

; 1492 Florence
: In Florence, Italy, in 1492 there was a purge against the &quot;vice of sodomy&quot;. The places used for homosexual acts were taverns, baths, and (sheds or houses used for illicit sex and gambling). The &quot;Eight of Watch&quot; (the city&#x27;s leading criminal court) issued several decrees associated with sodomy, and on April 11, 1492, it warned the managers of bathhouses to keep out &quot;suspect boys&quot; on penalty of a fine. In the short period from April 1492 to February 1494, it convicted 44 men for homosexual relations not involving violence or aggravating circumstances.
; 1492 Granada
: After the conquest of the Muslim city Granada in 1492, Queen Isabel the Catholic closed the public baths to suppress the homosexual activity they facilitated.
; 1876 Paris
: In France the first recorded police raid on a Parisian bathhouse was in 1876 in the on the . Six men aged 14 to 22 were prosecuted for an &quot;offence against public decency&quot; and the manager and two employees for &quot;facilitating pederasty&quot;.
; 1903 New York
: In the United States on February 21, 1903, New York police conducted the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the Ariston Hotel Baths. 26 men were arrested, and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; seven men received sentences ranging from four to 20 years in prison.
===Early gay bathhouses===

In New York City, the Everard (nicknamed &quot;the Everhard&quot;) was converted from a church to a bathhouse in 1888 and was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as the &quot;classiest, safest, and best known of the baths&quot;. It was damaged by fire on May 25, 1977, when nine men died and several others were seriously injured. The Everard closed in 1986. Also popular in the 1910s were the &quot;Produce Exchange Baths&quot; and the &quot;Lafayette Baths&quot; (403–405 Lafayette Street, which from 1916 was managed by Ira &amp; George Gershwin). American precisionist painter Charles Demuth used the Lafayette Baths as his favorite haunt. His 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a Victorian Turkish bath is likely to have been inspired by it. The Penn Post Baths in a hotel basement (the Penn Post Hotel, 304 West 31st Street) was a popular gay location in the 1920s despite a seedy condition and the lack of private rooms.

The American composer Charles Griffes (1884–1920) wrote in his diaries about visits to New York City bathhouses and the YMCA. His biography states: &quot;So great was his need to be with boys, that though his home contained two pianos, he chose to practice at an instrument at the Y, and his favourite time was when the players were coming and going from their games.&quot;

In London, the Savoy Victorian-style Turkish Baths at 92 Jermyn Street became a favorite spot (opening in 1910 and remaining open until September 1975). The journalist A.J. Langguth wrote: &quot;...[The baths at 92 Jermyn Street] represented a twilight arena for elderly men who came to sweat poisons from their systems and youths who came to strike beguiling poses in Turkish towels... although they were closely overseen by attendants, they provided a discreet place to inspect a young man before offering a cup of tea at Lyons.&quot; Regulars included Rock Hudson.

In the 1950s, Bermondsey&#x27;s Victorian-style Turkish Baths were rated by Kenneth Williams as &quot;quite fabulous&quot; in his diaries.
===Modern gay bathhouses===
In the 1950s, exclusively gay bathhouses began to open in the United States. Though subject to vice raids, these bathhouses were &quot;oases of homosexual camaraderie&quot; and were, as they remain today, &quot;places where it was safe to be gay&quot;, whether or not patrons themselves identified as homosexual. The gay baths offered a much safer alternative to sex in other public places.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhouses—now primarily gay-owned and operated—became fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet, relax and have sex. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, particularly those who had been rejected by their families due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.

Another service offered by the baths was voter registration. In the run-up to the 1980 election, the New St. Mark&#x27;s Baths in New York City, with the assistance of the League of Women Voters, conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.
In Australia, the first gay steam bath was opened in Sydney in 1967. This was the Bondi Junction Steam Baths at 109 Oxford Street. From 1972 through 1977 the following gay steam baths opened: Ken&#x27;s Karate Klub (nicknamed &quot;KKK&quot;), later called Ken&#x27;s at Kensington; No. 253; King Steam; Silhouette American Health Centre; Colt 107 Recreation Centre; Barefoot Boy; and Roman Bath (nicknamed &quot;Roman Ruins&quot;). In Melbourne the first gay bathhouse was Steamworks at 279 La Trobe Street, which opened in 1979 and closed 13 October 2008. Adelaide&#x27;s Pulteney 431 is one of the oldest gay saunas in Australia still in operation, having opened its doors to Adelaide&#x27;s gay community in 1977.

Gay saunas, as they are more commonly known in Australia and New Zealand, were present in most large cities in those countries by the late 1980s. As homosexuality was legalised in New Zealand and most Australian states during the 1970s and 1980s, there was no criminal conduct occurring on the premises of such &quot;sex on site venues&quot;.

In Britain, gay saunas were routinely raided by police up until the end of the 1980s; for example, raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham resulted in the establishment&#x27;s owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

==Bathhouses today==

Gay bathhouses today continue to fill a similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly where gay men increasingly tend to come out.

Some men still use bathhouses as a convenient, safe place to meet other men for sex. In areas where homosexuality is more accepted, safety may no longer be a primary attraction.

Many bathhouses are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is typically a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry to those who are visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.

Sexual encounters at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some feel that the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse &quot;for&quot;. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by men who have sex with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.

In many bathhouses the customer has a choice between renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons.

Some bathhouses have areas designed to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated only by a (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.

Some men use the baths as a cheaper alternative to hotels, despite the limitations of being potentially crowded public venues with only rudimentary rooms and limited or non-existent pass out privileges.
Bathhouses are not always identifiable as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world&#x27;s first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted &quot;Wet on Wellington&quot;, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.

In many countries, being identified in such a sauna was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In Ireland in November 1994, the &quot;Incognito&quot; sauna made mainstream press as the gay sauna where a priest had died of a heart attack and two other priests were on hand to help out. Scott Capurro is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to gay sexual culture including gay bathhouses.

==Layout and typical amenities==

On being buzzed in, the customer receives a towel (to wear, around the waist) and the key for his room or locker. The customer undresses, storing his clothing in the locker provided or room, and is then free to wander throughout the bathhouse which typically includes the amenities of a traditional bathhouse or steambath. In contrast with traditional bathhouses for bathing, the common areas of a modern gay bathhouse resemble a gym&#x27;s locker room or a small lobby.

Many bathhouses also provide free condoms and lubricant. Some establishments require a piece of identification or an item of value to be left with the front desk on entry. &quot;Homosexualities&quot; emphasized the importance of a towel: 

Bathhouses are often designed with imagery and/or music to create surroundings that are arousing to the visitors.

Bathhouses are usually dimly lit and play music, although an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often laid out in a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way is often referred to as a &quot;maze&quot;. Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spaces—rooms, hallways, or mazes, sometimes with glory holes—have as their only illumination a (dim) red &quot;Exit&quot; sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the exhibitionists so inclined. Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see pornographic movies playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse. The same movies may be shown on smaller screens in the individual rooms, sometimes for an extra fee.

Most men, beyond footwear, typically just wear the towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it is perfectly acceptable, even friendly, to put one&#x27;s hand under someone else&#x27;s towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the first step in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are frequent, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.

Some bathhouses require customers to purchase yearly memberships and many offer special entry rates to members, students, military, or other groups. In some countries, bathhouses can restrict entrance to men of certain age ranges (apart from the general requirement of being an adult) or physical types, although in other places this would be considered illegal discrimination. Some bathhouses hold occasional &quot;leather&quot;, &quot;underwear&quot;, or other theme nights.

In the 1970s bathhouses began to install &quot;fantasy environments&quot; which simulated erotic situations that would be illegal or dangerous in reality:

Many bathhouses sell food and drinks, cigarettes, pornography, sex toys, lubricants, and toiletries. Some bathhouses also provide non-sexual services such as massage and reflexology.

==Etiquette==

Customers typically divide their time between the showers, saunas, and hot tub area and the main areas of the establishment. Customers who have rented rooms have free access to their room.

Customers who have rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that they are available for sex. An open door can also be an invitation for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring.

When a room is occupied only by a single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those who would like to be penetrated anally (&quot;bottoms&quot;) will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others (&quot;tops&quot;) or to receive fellatio might lie face up.

In the past, the baths served as community spaces for gay men. Even now, some men choose to go to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.
In this highly sexualized environment a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened areas of the establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other&#x27;s hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.
Some establishments allow or encourage sex in specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must be confined to private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for hygiene reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority&#x27;s Environmental Health department.

==High-risk behavior==

===Sexually transmitted diseases===
From the mid-1980s onward there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for being a focus of infection encouraging the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).

In some countries, fears about the spread of STDs have prompted the closing of bathhouses—with their private rooms—in favor of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.

Neither the claim that bathhouses are responsible for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, nor the claim that they are not, has been conclusively proven. However, it is known that STDs are spread via unprotected sex, and as part of their membership agreement, or as a condition of entry, some bathhouses now require customers to affirm in writing that they will only practice safe sex on the premises. In addition, venues frequently provide free condoms, latex gloves, and lubrication (and/or have them available for purchase). In New Zealand and Australia, the New Zealand AIDS Foundation and constituent members of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations provide safe sex information for sex on site venue users.

Some anti-bathhouse activists argue that these measures are not enough, given that it is virtually impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse. However, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multi-partner sex, both of which put participants at greater risk for contracting STDs.

Others counter these claims by pointing out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex information, providing pamphlets and posting safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas). In cities with larger gay populations, STD and HIV testing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.

===Drugs===

In some countries, bathhouses are prohibited from selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license may be required to submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do not—or cannot—regulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs may make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas may find it easier to regulate the consumption of drugs on their premises.

The use of crystal meth is also known to lead to riskier sexual behavior, but since gay crystal meth users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such arrangements via the internet.

===Prostitution===

In some countries straight and gay bathhouses are used by rent boys to find customers by offering massage services, the &quot;complete service&quot; is often used as a euphemism for sex.
==Legal issues==

; Toronto bathhouse raids of 1981

: On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in Toronto, Ontario: the Club Baths, the Romans II Health and Recreation Spa, the Richmond Street Health Emporium, and The Barracks. The Richmond Health Emporium was so badly damaged in the raid that it never reopened. Nicknamed Operation Soap, the raid resulted in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both the gay and lesbian community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen&#x27;s Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police&#x27;s 52 Division.

; Raid on Toronto Women&#x27;s Bathhouse
: In 2000, Toronto police raided a women&#x27;s night at a bathhouse called Club Toronto. Police, almost all of them male, entered the establishment and walked around, taking the names and addresses of some 10 women and &quot;aggressively questioned&quot; volunteers. A Pussy Palace organizer stated &quot;any women at the event were deeply angered and traumatized&quot;. A judge of the Ontario Court of Justice held that the police had violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by using male police officers in the raid, describing the police actions as analogous to a strip search.

; Raid on Goliath&#x27;s
: In December 2002, Calgary police raided Goliath&#x27;s resulting in charges against 19 men. Fifteen men were arrested in the raid. Thirteen customers were charged as &quot;found-ins&quot; (found in a common bawdy house without a legal excuse) and two staff members were charged with the more serious offense of keeping a common bawdy house. The customers faced up to two years in prison. In addition, the owners of the bathhouse and a third staff member were later charged with keeping a common bawdy house.

: On May 27, 2004, a judge ruled that the police had reasonable justification to raid Goliath&#x27;s. Defense lawyers countered that none of the anonymous information the police acted uponfor example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premisesfeatured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They also pointed out that the police failed to call in the force&#x27;s gay community liaison officer. Goliath&#x27;s reopened a little more than a month after the raid.

: In November 2004, the Crown stayed the found-in charge against the last remaining patron, saying it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case. The case against the owners and managers of Goliath&#x27;s, however, was expected to come to trial in February 2005. Terry Haldane, the only &quot;found-in&quot; patron who was actively fighting the charge against him, accused the Crown of dropping the charge because Haldane and his lawyers had given notice of their plan to challenge the bawdy house law all the way to the Supreme Court.

: In February 2005, all remaining charges in the case were dropped. The court cited a lack of community support and evidence (from a poll) that the community supported the existence of gay bathhouses by a small margin.

; Raid on Hamilton&#x27;s Warehouse Spa
: On August 3, 2004, Hamilton&#x27;s Warehouse Spa and Bath was &quot;inspected&quot; by a task force of officers from the police, public health, the city&#x27;s building and licensing department, the fire department, and the alcohol and gaming commission. Two men were arrested and charged with committing indecent acts.

===United States===

As of 2013, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Berkeley, San Jose, Cleveland, Portland, Reno, Las Vegas, Detroit, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston, Denver, Miami and Fort Lauderdale were some of the American cities that had bathhouses in operation.

In 1985, the New York City Health Department ordered that the city&#x27;s gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, heterosexual sex clubs such as Plato&#x27;s Retreat had to shut down as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments would have been a violation of that ordinance.

On October 8, 2010, ten patrons and one employee were arrested during a police raid at Club Dallas in Texas. The patrons were charged with either public lewdness or indecent exposure while the employee was charged with interfering with the police. The Dallas Police Department&#x27;s liaison to the gay community stated that their actions were in response to a complaint.

====California====
In California the &quot;Consenting Adult Sex Bill&quot;, passed in January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex that took place within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the SOMA neighborhood, were the Ritch Street Health Club, the interior of which was designed like a Minoan palace, and The Barracks, a BDSM bathhouse on Hallam near Folsom Street, in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM sexual fantasy. In 1978, a group of police officers raided the Liberty Baths in the Polk Gulch neighborhood of San Francisco and arrested three patrons for &quot;lewd conduct in a public place&quot;, but the District Attorney&#x27;s office soon dropped the charges against them. 

In 1984, however, fear of the surging AIDS epidemic caused the San Francisco Health Department, with support from some gay activists, like Randy Shilts, and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. Judge Roy Wonder instead issued a court order that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed their doors. 

Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses in San Francisco gave in to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in Berkeley and San Jose.

The last gay bathhouse in San Francisco, 21st Street Baths, closed in 1987.

===China===

In March 2008, a series of police raids in gay bathhouses and at gay meeting spots in Beijing have resulted in arrests and bathhouse closures. This included raids on two branches of the Oasis bathhouses, known to be the most popular in Beijing. In 2000, police arrested 37 men in a Guangzhou gay spa on charges of prostitution. Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997.

===Germany, Austria and Switzerland===

The German-speaking countries have many gay bathhouses () since homosexuality had been legalized in 1969 (and later). The oldest ones are the Hotel Deutsche Eiche (German Oak) in Munich, the Vulcan-Sauna in Hanover and Kaiserbründ in Vienna.

=== Sweden ===
During the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, the Swedish government in 1987 banned gay saunas (), by amending the country&#x27;s public health law, the Infections Protection Act under the law known informally as the &quot;Bastuklubbslagen (SFS 1987:375)&quot;. The aim was to stop the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The law was criticised by noted gay rights organisation RSFL. Gay saunas were re-legalised on the 1 July 2004 due to a revision of law. The first gay sauna to be opened since the law was repealed was Klubb Vegas in Stockholm in April 2005.

==Notable patrons==
; Truman Capote
: Gay author Truman Capote wrote about his visits to the Everard Baths.
; Andrew Cunanan
:Andrew Cunanan&#x27;s membership card to the West Side Club NYC was recovered in Miami Beach close to where he killed designer Gianni Versace. It is not known if Cunanan visited the bathhouse during his murder spree or at some other time. Other receipts indicated he had visited New York in early May 1997 between the murder of Chicago developer Lee Miglin and Finn&#x27;s Point National Cemetery caretaker William Reese.
; Justin Fashanu
: The first openly gay British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his last night in Chariots Roman Spa.

; Jack Fritscher
: Gay erotic author and editor Jack Fritscher (born 1939) made hundreds of visits to the Mineshaft (a bathhouse without the bath).
; Andrew Holleran
: Andrew Holleran (born 1943) has written both essays and fiction about his experiences at the baths. The fatal May 25, 1977 fire at the Everard Baths in New York is a crucial event in his novel &quot;Dancer from the Dance&quot; (1978). Edmund White recalls, &quot;I used to see him years ago at the gay baths. But he wouldn&#x27;t be having sex; he would just observe.&quot;
; Mikhail Kuzmin
: Russian poet, novelist and composer Mikhail Kuzmin (1872–1936) is known to have patronized bathhouses. Some of the bathhouses in St. Petersburg at the time became known as friendly to gay men and provided &quot;attendants&quot;, who might provide sexual services for a fee. In his diary, Kuzmin writes of one bathhouse visit: &quot;the evening I had the urge to go to a bathhouse simply to be stylish, for the fun of it, for cleanliness.&quot;
; Harvey Milk
: The openly gay American politician Harvey Milk (1930–1978) vowed to stop visiting gay bathhouses when he ran for supervisor in 1975.
; Rudolf Nureyev
: The Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev (1938–1993) was known to frequent the baths in New York. He did not get past the door of the Mineshaft.
; Ned Rorem

==Celebrities and the Continental Baths==

Singer Bette Midler is well known for getting her start at the famous Continental Baths in New York City in the early 1970s, where she earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was there, accompanied by pianist Barry Manilow (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel), that she created her stage persona &quot;the Divine Miss M&quot;. On getting her start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked:

<doc id="484127" wikidata="Q1753197" url="?curid=484127" title="Room Service (Roxette album)">
<text>Room Service is the seventh studio album by Swedish pop duo Roxette, released worldwide from 2 April 2001. A planned release in the United States failed to materialise, as the duo&#x27;s label there, Edel Records America, had been disbanded the previous month due to financial difficulties. Marie Fredriksson was not as involved in the album&#x27;s production as she had been on previous records, taking part in the composition of just two songs. The album was remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in 2009.

Three singles were released from the record: lead single &quot;The Centre of the Heart&quot; was a hit throughout Europe, and was Roxette&#x27;s third number one single in their home country. &quot;Real Sugar&quot; underperformed; it remains the lowest-peaking of all their charting singles in both Germany and Switzerland. Conversely, &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot; performed well, and was the album&#x27;s longest-charting hit in Sweden and Switzerland. The latter was also the only single from the album to be released in the United Kingdom.

The album received mixed reviews upon release. AllMusic called it an &quot;exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed&quot;, although other publications were critical of Per Gessle&#x27;s lyrics, particularly to album track &quot;Jefferson&quot;. The record performed well commercially throughout mainland Europe, and was one of the best-selling albums of the year in several territories, but was largely ignored in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 120.

==Production==
&quot;Room Service&quot; is a shorter effort than preceding album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. The duo decided against touring in support of that release, with Per Gessle opting instead to immediately focus on recording demos for a follow-up album at his Tits &amp; Ass recording studio in Halmstad in April 1999. He eventually demoed a total of 29 songs for &quot;Room Service&quot;, excluding songs written by Marie Fredriksson, or songs originally demoed for &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, such as &quot;The Centre of the Heart&quot;. That song was first recorded in October 1997, and is the only track on &quot;Room Service&quot; to feature a production credit from &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; co-producer Michael Ilbert.

Fredriksson was not as involved in the production of &quot;Room Service&quot; as she had been on previous records; she composed just two songs for the album: &quot;Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Every Day&quot;. This is in stark contrast to &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;—she composed ten songs for that record. In a 2009 interview with Swedish publication &quot;Filter&quot;, when asked about the possibility of working with Fredriksson again following her brain tumour diagnosis in 2002, Gessle responded: &quot;This is difficult to say, but when I think about the [&quot;Room Service&quot;] sessions, she was obviously not too interested in Roxette [in] the years before she got sick.&quot;

&quot;Little Girl&quot; is Fredriksson&#x27;s only contribution to the album. It was written and composed solely by her, while &quot;Every Day&quot; was co-written with Gessle. The latter song was also released on deluxe editions of &quot;The Ballad Hits&quot; in 2002, as well as &quot;The Rox Box/Roxette 86–06&quot;. It later appeared as a bonus track when &quot;Room Service&quot; was remastered and reissued in 2009, along with another Fredriksson-composed track, &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;. Despite this, &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; is unrelated to the album: it had first been demoed in April 1997 and re-recorded in June 2004 during sessions for Fredriksson&#x27;s first English-language solo album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Change&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The Centre of the Heart&quot; was released as the lead single, and its music video was directed by longtime collaborator Jonas Åkerlund. Filmed over three days at The Madonna Inn in California, it is Roxette&#x27;s most expensive music video, surpassing the budget of &quot;Spending My Time&quot; from their 1991 album &quot;Joyride&quot;. The song was sent to radio on 19 February 2001, with a commercial single release following a month later. It went on to spend four weeks at number one in Sweden, making it their third number one single in their home country. The album was released worldwide from 2 April, with a North American release set for the following day via Edel America Records. A United States release failed to materialise, as Edel America was disbanded in March 2001 due to financial difficulties, although the record was released in Canada through EMI Music.

Photography for the record sleeve was shot at The Madonna Inn and was created by Tempel, a design duo consisting of Åkerlund and photographer Sarah Sheppard. &quot;Real Sugar&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single throughout Europe. It peaked at number 12 in Spain and number 23 in Sweden, but it performed poorly elsewhere, charting only in Germany and Switzerland and becoming their lowest-charting single to date in both territories (numbers 96 and 72, respectively). The third and final single from the album, &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot;, was more successful, peaking at number 21 in Sweden and becoming their longest-charting single in the country since &quot;You Don&#x27;t Understand Me&quot; in 1995 (14 weeks). Similarly, it peaked at number 29 on the Swiss Hitparade and spent 17 weeks on the chart—their longest-charting single in that country since &quot;Sleeping in My Car&quot; in 1994. It was also the first and only single from &quot;Room Service&quot; to be released in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 89.

The &quot;Room Service World Tour&quot; was Roxette&#x27;s first concert tour in over six years. Concerts planned in South Africa were cancelled after the September 11 attacks. The tour began on 28 September and saw them performing in Spain, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Russia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden over its 25-dates. On reviewing one of their concerts, Per Bjurman from &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; was critical of the duo&#x27;s chosen playlist and suggested that they had become too stuck in their past glories. Johan Lindqvist from &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot; was more positive, scoring their concert in Munich four stars.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Room Service&quot; received a mixed response from critics. Leslie Mathew of AllMusic said it was their best album since &quot;Joyride&quot; (1991), calling it an &quot;exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed.&quot; Chili Paddy from MTV Asia also praised the album, and said it contained several potential hit singles. Fred Bronson from &quot;Billboard&quot; rated it the 7th best album of the year. Bjurman from &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; put it bluntly: &quot;[&quot;Room Service&quot;] is not very good&quot;, elaborating: &quot;Many songs sound like covers of old Roxette material. Perhaps inevitable when a band returns to its &#x27;roots&#x27;, but a little more imagination may be required.&quot; However, he did praise the three singles, calling &quot;Milk and Toast and Honey&quot; their &quot;strongest ballad since &#x27;It Must Have Been Love&#x27; or maybe even &#x27;Listen to Your Heart&#x27;,&quot; before ending his review with &quot;Roxette is not finished. But soon, I suspect.&quot;

The first verse of album track &quot;Jefferson&quot; was heavily criticised by English-language reviewers. Simon P. Ward from Yahoo! Music said he laughed &quot;uncontrollably at that lyrical gem&quot;; Caroline Sullivan from &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;one of the worst first verses in history&quot; and said of the entire album: &quot;Fredriksson&#x27;s vocals are compelling yet curiously unengaged as she tries to negotiate Per Gessle&#x27;s lyrics.&quot; Ward additionally noted that &quot;Make My Head Go Pop&quot; has &quot;everything and the kitchen sink thrown into it—keyboards, techno beats, the guitar riff from the Stones&#x27; &#x27;Satisfaction&#x27;, and strings.&quot; Anders Nunstedt from &quot;Expressen&quot; initially gave the album a positive review, rating it three stars out of five and praising Gessle&#x27;s songwriting and Clarence Öfwerman&#x27;s production. However, in recent years, he has given a more critical overview of the album. Speaking of &quot;Room Service&quot; in relation to Roxette&#x27;s other studio albums, he called it &quot;Outdated, unattractive and also relatively unmusical.&quot; He also hypothesized: &quot;On &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, you heard a band that had lost its compass. You do not have to listen carefully to &quot;Room Service&quot; to hear the sound of a duo who had been lost in the woods for so long that the search had ended.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album was not as successful as the duo&#x27;s preceding studio albums, and was largely ignored in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 120 there. Per Gessle commented in 2009: &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s hard to stay on top of the world forever. I&#x27;m old-fashioned, in that I believe it&#x27;s enough to have a fantastic song and it will become a hit and then you can be on top again. &quot;Joyride&quot; sold 11 million copies, &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; 9 million, which means there are a lot of people who know who we are and who might be interested in what we are still doing. But it&#x27;s normal for some albums to sell less than others, like &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. &#x27;We&#x27;ll sell more next time&#x27;, I thought, but then &quot;Room Service&quot; did even worse. I don&#x27;t know why.&quot;

&quot;Room Service&quot; peaked at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s European Albums, and at number two on CNN&#x27;s WorldBeat Albums. It topped the national record charts in both Belgium and Sweden, and peaked at number two in Switzerland, number three in Germany, number four in Austria, number five in Greece and Spain, number seven in Norway, number eight in Poland, and number ten in Finland. It performed particularly well in Scandinavian territories, ending 2001 as one of the top fifteen best-selling albums of the year in Finland (tenth), Sweden (twelfth), and Norway (fourteenth). It sold well throughout central Europe. It was the 34th best-selling album of the year in Germany, the 42nd best-selling album in Belgium, and the 46th best-selling album in Switzerland. It was also certified either gold or platinum in many of these countries.

<text>Otto Koloman Wagner (; 13 July 1841 – 11 April 1918) was an Austrian architect, furniture designer and urban planner. He was a leading member of the Vienna Secession movement of architecture, founded in 1897, and the broader Art Nouveau movement. Many of his works are found in his native city of Vienna, and illustrate the rapid evolution of architecture during the period. His early works were inspired by classical architecture. By mid-1890s, he had already designed several buildings in what became known as the Vienna Secession style. Beginning in 1898, with his designs of Vienna Metro stations, his style became floral and Art Nouveau, with decoration by Koloman Moser. His later works, 1906 until his death in 1918, had geometric forms and minimal ornament, clearly expressing their function. They are considered predecessors to modern architecture.

==Education and early career==
Wagner was born in 1841 in Penzing, a district in Vienna. He was the son of Suzanne (née von Helffenstorffer-Hueber) and Rudolf Simeon Wagner, a notary to the Royal Hungarian Court. He began his architectural studies in 1857 at the age of sixteen at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute. When he finished his studies there, in 1860 he traveled to Berlin and studied at the Royal Academy of Architecture under Carl Ferdinand Busse, a classicist and student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the leader of the German school of neoclassical and neo-Gothic architecture. He returned to Vienna in 1861 and continued his architectural education at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, under August Sicard von von Sicardsburg and Edouard von der Nüll, who had designed the neoclassical Vienna State Opera and the architectural monuments along the Vienna .
In 1862, at the age of 22, he joined the architectural firm of Ludwig von Förster, whose studio had designed much of the new architecture along the . The first part of his career was devoted to the transformation of that boulevard into a showcase of neo-Gothic, neo-Renassiance, and neoclassical styles. During this period, which lasted until about 1880, he described his own style as &quot;a sort of free Renaissance&quot;.

His first realized major project was the Orthodox Synagogue on Rumbach Street in Budapest. His design was selected in a competition held in 1868, when he was twenty-seven years old. The octagonal hall of the synagogue was concealed behind a four-story structure facing the street. The hall was filled with light from stained glass windows on the octagonal lantern above, and large circular windows in each of the eight bays. On the first floor above the ground floor was an octagonal gallery reserved for women. The facade was made of brick of different colors, and was decorated with minarets and towers with a Moorish appearance, while the interior featured colorful patterns of mosaic slender on the walls and highly decorated columns which supported arches over each of the bays. 

He began to develop his philosophy of architecture, based on the need for buildings to be, above all, functional. He continued to develop this idea throughout his career. In 1896, in his book &quot;Modern Architecture&quot;, he wrote, &quot;Only that which is practical can be beautiful&quot;. 
==Early projects, and the First Villa Wagner (1880s)==
In the 1880s, he began to construct buildings of which he was both the architect and investor in the project, sharing in the financial benefits. In 1882 he designed a luxury apartment building on Stadiongasse in Vienna, close to the Parliament and the city hall. The facade was inspired by the Renaissance, but the interior was designed to be highly practical, luxurious, and constructed with the highest quality materials available. The benefits of this building allowed him to build several more similar apartment buildings. It illustrated his doctrine of the connection between beauty and function.

His next major project was the headquarters of the Länderbank in Vienna. He won the design competition in 1882 and built it in 1883–84. It was built on a very irregular site, mostly at an angle to the street, which allowed him to be more creative. The five-story Renaissance facade gave little idea of the complexity of the building behind it, which had multiple diverging axes. The visitor passed through a circular vestibule, then turned at an angle into multi-storied semi-circular central hall with a glass skylight, where the banking function was located. He also used new materials, such as an enduit lisse, and much larger windows than were customary in the period, repeated the plan on each floor. He later described his approach to the building: &quot;The demands for air and light, the desire to assure easy circulation and orientation inside the space, and especially the fact that the activities of a bank can develop on one direction or another, made it desirable to be able to easily transform the work spaces.&quot; He was to follow the same concepts twenty years later when he designed the Postal Savings Bank in Vienna.

The following project, in 1886, was the first Villa Wagner, a country house he built for himself on the edge of the Vienna woods. He called it his &quot;Italian Dream&quot;, and it had neoclassical elements inspired by Palladio. it was surrounded by a park carefully designed to complement the architecture. The principal facade had a double stairway ascending to a portico with a colonnade, which was the entrance to the grand salon. The porch was decorated curving wrought iron, statuary, and a coffered ceiling. At either end of the main villa were pergolas with open colonnades. On either side of the main stairway to the entrance he placed plaques in Latin concisely stating his philosophy On one side, &quot;Without art and love, there is no life&quot;; and on the other, &quot;Necessity is the sole mistress of art.&quot; In 1895, he modified the house. One of the pergolas was transformed from a winter garden into a billiards room, illuminated by floral stained glass windows, one designed by the painter Adolf Michael Boehm. The other pergola was made into his studio, also with colorful decorative windows.

Two more of his buildings appeared on the boulevards of Vienna. The first, completed in 1887, was a six-story apartment building on Universitätsstrase, which had a rigorous vertical facade divided by ornamental pilasters, divided horizontally by a very ornate wrought iron balcony on the first floor and a sculpted cornice beneath the roof, dividing the facade into three distinct parts. The second was the &quot;Zum Anker&quot; building on Spiegelgasse, and the Graben, the historic boulevard in the heart of the city. This building, completed in 1894, combined apartments on the upper floors, and stores on the street level, bearing large display windows. On top was another glass structure, like a small temple, which contained a photography studio. It was another notable example of Wagner skillfully adapting the design of the building to its practical functions.

Wagner always fought against the idea of historicism which helped Vienna of that time to sway over and come up to its notable architectural achievement, the Ringstrasse Boulevard. He had a chance to deliver a speech at Academy of Fine Arts in 1894, where he said that ,&quot;The realism of our time must penetrate the work of art.&quot;

== Urban planning and the Vienna &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; (1894–1900) ==
In the 1890s, Wagner became increasingly interested in urban planning. Vienna was growing rapidly; it reached a population of 1,590,000 residents in 1898. In 1890, the city government decided expand the urban transit system outwards to the new neighborhoods. In April 1894, Wagner was named artistic counselor for the new &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; and gradually was given responsibility for the design of the bridges, viaducts, and stations, including the elevators, signs, lighting, and decoration. Wagner hired seventy artists and designers for his transit stations, including two young designers who later became very prominent in the birth of modern architecture, Joseph Maria Olbrich and Josef Hoffmann.

The government committee in charge of the project specified that the buildings should be covered in white plaster, for uniformity, and that the style should be Renaissance, also for uniformity. Working within these requirements, Wagner designed stations and other structures which combined utility, simplicity and elegance. The most notable station he designed was Karlsplatz station (1894–99). It had two separate pavilions, one for each direction, and was constructed with a metal frame, and covered on the exterior with marble plaques and plaster plaques in the interior. The exterior was covered with designs in a sunflower pattern, which continue on the semi-circular facade. The carefully designed gilded decoration gives the building a remarkable combination of functionality and elegance.

==The Vienna Secession==

In 1894, he became Professor of Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, and increasingly expressed the necessity of leaving behind historical forms and romanticism and developing Architectural Realism, where the form was determined by the function of the building. In 1896 he published a textbook entitled &quot;Modern Architecture&quot; in which he expressed his ideas about the role of the architect; it was based on the text of his 1894 inaugural lecture to the Academy. His style incorporated the use of new materials and new forms to reflect the fact that society itself was changing. In his textbook, he stated that &quot;new human tasks and views called for a change or reconstitution of existing forms&quot;. He wrote in his manifesto on Modern Architecture, &quot;Art and artists have the duty and obligation to represent their period. The application here and there of all the previous styles, as we have seen in the last few decades, cannot be the future of architecture...The realism of our time must be present in every newborn work of art.

In 1897, he aligned himself with Vienna Secession, a movement started by fifty Vienna artists formally known as the Association of Austrian plastic artists. Its founding members included Gustav Klimt, its first President, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Josef Hoffmann, and Koloman Moser. The Secession declared war on the historicism and realism decreed by the Arts academies, and called for the abolition of the boundary between the fine arts and the applied and decorative arts. of architecture and art. Its goal was proclaimed by Wagner&#x27;s student, Olbrich: &quot;To each epoch its own art, and to each art its freedom.&quot; The most famous architectural work of the Secession, Olbrich&#x27;s Secession Building (1897–98) showed Wagner&#x27;s influence. However, after the success of Secession works at the 1900 Paris Exposition, many of the members wanted to produce furniture and other Secession designs in series, and disputed the direction of the Secession. The dispute reached a head in 1905, when one of the prominent painters of the Secession, Carl Moll, proposed that the Secession purchase a prominent Vienna art gallery as an outlet for the Secession artists. This was opposed by the more traditional artists in the group. It was put to a vote of the members of the Secession, and Klimt&#x27;s position was defeated by a single vote. Klimt, Wagner, Moser, and Hoffmann promptly resigned from the Secession.
Wagner had a strong influence on his pupils at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. This &quot;Wagner School&quot; included Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Karl Ehn, Jože Plečnik, and Max Fabiani. Another student of Wagner&#x27;s was Rudolph Schindler, who said &quot;Modern Architecture began with Mackintosh in Scotland, Otto Wagner in Vienna, and Louis Sullivan in Chicago.&quot;

==Majolika-Haus and the Linke Wienzeile buildings (1898-99)==
The Linke Wienzeile Buildings are three apartment buildings in Vienna, constructed in 1898–99. The most famous of these is the Majolica House, at 40 Linke Wienzeile. Its facade is entirely covered with majolica, or glazed earthenware tiles in the colorful floral designs which characterized the early Vienna Secession. The Art Nouveau floral design of its facade was made by his student . The other building, &quot;Linke Wienzeile 38&quot;, is known as &quot;House with medallions&quot; because of its decor of gilded stucco medallions by Wagner&#x27;s student and frequent collaborator, Koloman Moser. The roof, visible from far away, features several sculpted heads, called &quot;The Criers&quot;, or &quot;The Crying Women&quot; by Othmar Schimkowitz. He provided sculpture for two other Vienna Secession landmarks by Wagner, including the Angels on the roof of the Kirche am Steinhof church in Vienna, and sculpture for the Austrian Postal Savings Bank. The sculptures and other ornament were removed when the style was out of fashion, but have more recently been restored.

Wagner had his own town apartment in a third building, at 3 Köstlergasse. It featured decoration based on Japanese floral prints, and furniture of his own design, but its most famous feature was the bathroom. A marble plaque on the wall supported the shower head, the sink was of marble on nickel legs, and the bathtub was of glass, mounted in a nickel frame. Wagner had the bathroom displayed at the 1900 Paris Universal Exposition.

==Church of St. Leopold (1902–1907)==
The Church of St. Leopold was built to accompany a large new psychiatric hospital constructed on the edge of Vienna. He completed for the design of the hospital, but received a commission only for the church. Wagner had earlier written an academic study entitled &quot;The Modern style in Church construction&quot; and this was his opportunity to use his ideas in a building.

The main feature of the church is a dome, and the facade was covered with marble plaques two centimeters thick, fixed with copper-headed bolts. The same white and gold design was maintained in the interior. The church could hold eight hundred worshippers, with seats for four hundred, divided into separate sections for men, women, and hospital staff. The ceiling was also white, divided into sections by gilded lines. The altar, the central point, was covered with a lacelike gilded cupola, matching the dome overhead. The floor was made of white and black tiles, and sloped slightly, so those in the church had better view of the altar. The large stained glass windows were designed by Wagner&#x27;s frequent collaborator, Koloman Moser. It was one of the first and most celebrated examples of modern church architecture.
==Austrian Postal Savings Bank (1903–1912)==
In his later years, Wagner experimented continually. He tried new materials, such as aluminum, which he used in the decoration of the entrance of the dispatch office the &quot;Die Zeit&quot; newspaper in Vienna. His most ambitious experiment was the Austrian Postal Savings Bank (1903–1912), which is often considered his most famous and most influential building. It was the prime example of his doctrine that form follows function. He wrote, &quot;All modern creation should correspond to the new materials and the new demands of our time, if it is to harmonize modern man.&quot;

Wagner conceived the building in 1903, when he was sixty-two years old, and continued working on it until it was completed, when he was seventy-one. The exterior was covered with marble plates with ornamental aluminium rivets in a purely geometric pattern. The most remarkable features were the interiors. The central banking room, where the cashiers were located, had a suspended steel and glass ceiling, and a floor of glass tiles. He made extensive use of new materials, such as aluminum, for the door knobs, grills, lamps, and other details throughout the building. It had no decoration; every element was designed to be clean, geometric, and functional. He designed the furniture to complement the style of the architecture.
==Later life and projects==
By 1905, the year he left the Vienna Secession, Wagner had achieved an international reputation. In that year he proposed a monumental plan for the Palace of Peace proposed by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for construction of the Hague, but it was never realized. He continued to produce new editions of his book &quot;Modern Architecture&quot;, and three volumes entitled &quot;Sketches, Projects, Constructions&quot;. He published a series of books on topics including theater architecture, hotel architecture, and a particularly forward-looking work, &quot;The Great City&quot;, published in 1911, devoted to urban planning, explaining how the expansion of large cities should be managed. He participated in the International Congress of Architecture in London in 1906, and traveled to New York to the International Congress of Urban Art in 1910. In the same year he became the Vice Rector of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. He was named Vice President of the Permanent Commission of Congress of Fine Arts in Paris in 1912. In 1912 he proposed a very modern municipal museum for Vienna dedicated to The Emperor Franz-Joseph. However, the final competition for this building was won by one of Wagner&#x27;s former students, Josef Hoffmann. The project was halted by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. In 1913, he became an honorary professor at the Academy and retired, but continued to teach students who had enrolled prior to his retirement.

While he proposed many projects, only a few were actually built. These included a strikingly geometric and modernistic hospital for victims of Lupus disease in Vienna (1908). His last large-scale project, a building of thirty large apartments on Neustiftgasse and Döblergasse in Vienna. The building had a very modern white plaster facade with very discreet geometric decoration of blue ceramics (Döblergasse) and pieces of black glass (Neustifgasse). Wagner had his own apartment on the second floor of the Döblergasse building. He designed all the furniture, carpets and decoration in his apartment, as well as the towels and bathroom fixtures. The ground floor of this building also served as the offices of the Wiener Werkstätte architectural movement from 1912 until 1932.
==The Second Wagner Villa (1912)==
Another of his last projects was the Second Wagner Villa on Hüttelbergstrasse in Vienna. It was located near to, and in sight of, his first villa, which he had sold in 1911. It was considerably smaller than his earlier villa. The building was designed to be extremely simple and functional, with a maximum of light, and a maximum use of new materials, including reinforced concrete, asphalt, glass mosaics, and aluminum. The villa is in the form of a cube, with white plaster walls. The primary decoration elements of the exterior are bands of blue glass tile in geometric patterns. The front door is reached by a monumental stairway to the first floor. The servant&#x27;s quarters were downstairs, and the main floor was occupied by a large single room, which served as a salon or dining room. For the furniture, he selected many works designed and manufactured by one of his former students, Marcel Kammerer. 
Wagner intended the house as the main residence of his wife after his death, but she died before him, and he sold the house in September 1916.

Wagner died on April 11. 1918, shortly before the end of the First World War, in his apartment on Döblergasse in Vienna.
==Furniture==
Wagner often designed the furniture to complement the design of the building. His furnishings for the Postal Savings Bank were particularly notable for their simplicity and functionality, and combination of traditional materials with new materials, such as aluminum

==History==

In the 16th century there was a tavern in the area now known as Hyvinkäänkylä (literally &quot;the village of Hyvinkää&quot;), which lies approximately halfway between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna. It was mentioned the first time in 1495 as &quot;Höffinga&quot;. The first tax catalogues also marked the existence of some houses in the area around the same time. During the 16th century there was also a mine close to current-day Kytäjä village.

Hyvinkää village gradually grew in the latter half of the 19th century, though it was the construction of the railway network through Finland, beginning in 1861, that marked the starting point for the town&#x27;s rapid growth. Hyvinkää, who still belonged to the Nurmijärvi parish at that time, resigned in 1917 as its own parishioner.

The construction of Finland&#x27;s first stretch of railroad, the Helsinki–Hämeenlinna line, determined the location of the present city centre and the railway station of Hyvinkää is one of the few original stations still in use. From Hyvinkää the railway also branches off to the port of Hanko. The Hanko–Hyvinkää Railroad was the first private railroad in Finland, founded in 1862, and acquired by the Finnish State RR Co. in 1875. In the early 20th century, the station village in Hyvinkää was an intermediate stopping point for many emigrants leaving by ship from Hanko for a new life in North America.

The air quality of Hyvinkää was considered healthy due to dense pine forests, and in the 1880s a group of physicians from Helsinki opened a sanatorium for patients seeking rest and recuperation.

Industrialization brought a wool factory to Hyvinkää in 1892 – the Donner family&#x27;s &quot;Hyvinge Yllespinneri&quot;. The factory ceased operation in the 1990s, but the red-brick halls still remain. The building has found several new uses, including an exhibition centre and a theater.

Hyvinkää Airfield served as the country&#x27;s main airport for a short time after the second World War while Helsinki-Malmi Airport was under the control of the Allied Powers. There is now a motorsports centre near the airfield.

Hyvinkää&#x27;s population grew quickly following the Second World War. It became home to many Finnish Karelian refugees after Karelia was handed out to Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty. Nowadays Hyvinkää is the sixth biggest town by inhabitants of Uusimaa.

<text>A Singspiel (; plural: ; ) is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil.
==History==
Some of the first Singspiele were miracle plays in Germany, where dialogue was interspersed with singing. By the early 17th century, miracle plays had grown profane, the word &quot;Singspiel&quot; is found in print, and secular Singspiele were also being performed, both in translated borrowings or imitations from English and Italian songs and plays, and in original German creations.

In the 18th century, some Singspiele were translations of English ballad operas. In 1736, the Prussian ambassador to England commissioned a translation of the ballad opera &quot;The Devil to Pay&quot;. This was successfully performed in the 1740s in Hamburg and Leipzig. A further version of this was made by Johann Adam Hiller and C. F. Weiße in 1766 (&quot;Der Teufel ist los oder Die verwandelten Weiber&quot;), the first of a string of such collaborations which led to Hiller and Weisse being called &quot;the fathers of the German Singspiel.&quot;

French operas with spoken dialogue (&quot;opéras comiques&quot;) were frequently transcribed into German and became very successful in Vienna in the late 1770s and early 1780s. By contrast, German translations of contemporary Italian &quot;opere buffe&quot;, which were quite successful in England and France at the time, were significantly less frequent. Singspiele were considered middle-to-lower class entertainment – as opposed to the predominantly aristocratic genres of opera, ballet and stage play – and were usually performed by traveling s (such as the Koch, Döbbelin and Koberwein companies), rather than by established companies within metropolitan centers.

Mozart wrote several Singspiele: &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; (1768), &quot;Zaide&quot; (1780), &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (1782), &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; (1786), and finally &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (1791). E. T. A. Hoffmann, who admired him, composed Singspiele, such as &quot;Liebe und Eifersucht&quot; in 1807.

In 1927, Kurt Weill created a new word, &quot;Songspiel&quot;, to describe his work &quot;Mahagonny-Songspiel&quot;.

<doc id="484153" wikidata="Q6872780" url="?curid=484153" title="Miranda (1948 film)">
<text>Miranda is a 1948 black and white British comedy film, directed by Ken Annakin and written by Peter Blackmore, who also wrote the play of the same name from which the film was adapted. The film stars Glynis Johns, Googie Withers, Griffith Jones, Margaret Rutherford, John McCallum and David Tomlinson. Denis Waldock provided additional dialogue. Music for the film was played by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Muir Mathieson. The sound director was B. C. Sewell.

The film is a light comedy fantasy about a beautiful and playful mermaid Miranda and her effect on the men and women she meets, as she outrageously flirts with and flatters every man she meets.

Glynis Johns and Margaret Rutherford reprised their roles in the 1954 colour sequel, &quot;Mad About Men&quot;.

==Plot summary==
As his wife is uninterested in fishing, Dr. Paul Martin goes on a holiday on the Cornwall coast without her. There, Miranda, a mermaid, catches him by pulling on his fishing line and making him fall in the water. She drags him down to her underwater cavern where she keeps him prisoner for a week and only lets him go after he agrees to show her London, where he lives. Having ordered several extra long dresses from his wife&#x27;s London couturier to cover her tail, he disguises her as an invalid patient in a bath chair and takes her to his home, initially for a three weeks stay.

Martin&#x27;s wife Clare reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, but insists he hire someone to look after the &quot;patient&quot;. He selects Nurse Carey for her eccentric nature and takes her into his confidence. To Paul&#x27;s relief, Carey is delighted to be working for a mermaid as she has always believed they exist.

Miranda&#x27;s seductive nature earns her the admiration of not only Paul, but also his chauffeur Charles, as well as Nigel, the fiancé of Clare&#x27;s friend and neighbour Isobel, arousing the jealousy of the women. Nigel even breaks off his engagement, but when he and Charles discover that Miranda has been flirting with both of them, they come to their senses.

With Clare strongly suspecting that Miranda is a mermaid, she makes Martin admit it. But when Miranda overhears Clare telling Paul that the public must be told, Miranda wheels herself down to the Thames and makes her escape into the water. She had previously told them she would go to Majorca for a visit.

In the final scene, Miranda is shown on a rock, holding a merbaby on her lap.

==Cast==

* Glynis Johns as Miranda Trewella 
* Googie Withers as Clare Martin
* Griffith Jones as Dr Paul Martin 
* John McCallum as Nigel
* Margaret Rutherford as Nurse Carey 
* David Tomlinson as Charles 
* Yvonne Owen as Betty, the Martins&#x27; other servant and Charles&#x27;s girlfriend
* Sonia Holm as Isobel
* Brian Oulton as Manell 
* Zena Marshall as Secretary
* Lyn Evans as Inn Landlady
* Stringer Davis as Museum Attendant
* Hal Osmond as Railway Carman
* Maurice Denham as Cockle Vendor
==Original play==
The film was based on a play by Peter Blackmore. He says he was inspired to write it after reading a scientific article about mermaids.

In the play on which the film is based, Miranda eventually has to return to Cornwall to spawn, much to the displeasure of Martin&#x27;s wife.

The play was a hit in London – starring Genine Graham – and had a run in New York with Diana Lynn.

==Production==
The film was put into production hurriedly in order to beat &quot;Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid&quot; to the screen. The initial director was Michael Chorlton. According to Ken Annakin, filming had been going for less than two weeks when Chorlton was fired by the head of the studio, Sydney Box, who was unhappy with the director&#x27;s handling of the material, particularly his over-use of wide-angle, deep focus camera techniques. Box asked Annakin, who had just finished filming &quot;Broken Journey&quot; to take over, which the director reluctantly did after Box pointed out it was either him or someone else. Annakin took over with three days of preparation.

Annakin said the &quot;script was full of well-tried, funny fishy jokes&quot; and &quot;was inevitably going to be a stagey-type movie.&quot; He says he &quot;despised&quot; Griffith Jones &quot;as a man&quot; because he was difficult to deal with, &quot;always trying to score over the other actors.&quot; Annakin says he developed a crush on Johns during filming and she tried to seduce him one night (she was married but her husband was gay) - but he refused because he did not want her to have power over him. They went on to make six more films together.

The opening credits include the line &quot;Tail by Dunlop&quot;. All underwater scenes were shot with a stunt double. Joan Hebden wore the tail by Dunlop. Glynis Johns stated in later interviews that the rubber tail was very buoyant, which caused problems as it tended to keep her head under the water.

There was location filming in London and Cornwall.

==Reception==

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Here is a pleasant little comedy which brings a welcome change of temper to the contemporary British screen. The dialogue is witty, the situations well contrived, even if the joke wears a bit thin by the end and some of the effects are laboured. Glynis Johns makes a most enchanting mermaid, sophisticated and not at all &#x27;hey nonny&#x27;. Margaret Rutherford gives a characteristically exuberant performance as the eccentric nurse, dancing the Mazurka or carrying out more domestic duties with equal zest. David Tomlinson is an amusing chauffeur, Griffith Jones does well as Paul, and Googie Withers, as his wife, acts with customary assurance.&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Everything is rightly played for laughs and Glynis Johns makes the mermaid an attractive and almost credible creature. Griffith Jones is good as her serious sponsor. Googie Withers turns in a nice performance as his bewildered wife, and David Tomlinson and John McCallum do well as the lovestruck swains. As nurse to the mermaid, Margaret Rutherford gets plenty of laughs, but occasionally descends to unnecessary burlesque.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1948. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; Miranda was one of the runners-up for &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office.

Producer&#x27;s receipts were £143,400 in the UK and £32,600 overseas meaning it recorded a profit of £5,600. Annakin says the film was not popular in America at all due to the release of &quot;Mr Peabody and the Mermaid&quot;; he claims the makers of that movie threatened to sue Gainsborough Pictures for copyright infringement but the latter were protected by the fact it was based on a play.

==DVD release==
The film was released on home video for the first time in North America on DVD on 5 July 2011 from VCI Entertainment.

<text>Aunt Jemima was an American breakfast brand for pancake mix, table syrup, and other breakfast food products. The original version of the pancake mix was developed in 1888–1889 by the Pearl Milling Company and was advertised as the first &quot;ready-mix&quot; cooking product.

Aunt Jemima was modeled after, and has been a famous example of, the &quot;Mammy&quot; archetype in the Southern United States. Due to the &quot;Mammy&quot; stereotype&#x27;s historical ties to the Jim Crow era, Quaker Oats announced in June 2020 that the Aunt Jemima brand would be discontinued &quot;to make progress toward racial equality&quot;, leading to the Aunt Jemima image being removed by the fourth quarter of 2020.

In June 2021, amidst heightened racial unrest in the United States, the Aunt Jemima brand name was discontinued by its current owner, PepsiCo, with all products rebranded to Pearl Milling Company, the name of the company that produced the original pancake mix product. The Aunt Jemima name remains in use in the brand&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Same great taste as Aunt Jemima.&quot;

Nancy Green portrayed the Aunt Jemima character at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and was one of the first Black corporate models in the United States. Subsequent advertising agencies hired dozens of actresses to perform the role as the first organized sales promotion campaign.

==History==
In 1888, &quot;St. Joseph Gazette&quot; editor Chris L. Rutt and his friend Charles G. Underwood bought a small flour mill at 214 North 2nd St. in St. Joseph, Missouri. Rutt and Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Pearl Milling Company&quot; produced a range of milled products (such as wheat flour and cornmeal) using a pearl milling process. Facing a glutted flour market, after a year of experimentation they began selling their excess flour in paper bags with the generic label &quot;Self-Rising Pancake Flour&quot; (later dubbed &quot;the first ready-mix&quot;).

===Branding and trademark===
To distinguish their pancake mix, in late 1889 Rutt appropriated the &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; name and image from lithographed posters seen at a vaudeville house in St. Joseph, Missouri. &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; was portrayed by Nancy Green, a former slave, of Montgomery County, Kentucky.

In 1915, the well-known Aunt Jemima brand was the basis for a trademark law ruling that set a new precedent. Previously, United States trademark law had protected against infringement by other sellers of the same product, but under the &quot;Aunt Jemima Doctrine&quot;, the seller of pancake mix was also protected against infringement by an unrelated seller of a different but related product—pancake syrup.
Aunt Jemima became one of the longest continually running logos and trademarks in the history of American advertising.

===Logo===
The earliest advertising was based upon a vaudeville parody, and it remained a caricature for many years.

Quaker Oats commissioned Haddon Sundblom, a nationally known commercial artist, to paint a portrait of an obese actress named Anna Robinson, and the Aunt Jemima package was redesigned around the new likeness.

James J. Jaffee, a freelance artist from the Bronx, New York, also designed one of the images of Aunt Jemima used by Quaker Oats to market the product into the mid-20th century.

Just as the formula for the mix changed several times over the years, so did the Aunt Jemima image. In 1968, the face of Aunt Jemima became a composited creation. She was slimmed down from her previous appearance, depicting a more &quot;svelte&quot; look, wearing a white collar and a geometric print &quot;headband&quot; still resembling her previous kerchief.
In 1989, marking the 100th anniversary of the brand, her image was again updated, with all head-covering removed, revealing wavy, gray-streaked hair, gold-trimmed pearl earrings, and replacing her plain white collar with lace. At the time, the revised image was described as a move towards a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; depiction, with Quaker marketing the change as giving her &quot;a more contemporary look&quot; which remained on the products until early 2021.

===Rebranding of 2020–2021===
On June 17, 2020, Quaker Oats announced that the Aunt Jemima brand would be discontinued and replaced with a new name and image &quot;to make progress toward racial equality&quot;. The image was removed from packaging in fall 2020, while the name change was said to be planned for a later date.

Within one day of the June 2020 announcement, other similarly motivated rebrandings and reviews of brand marketing were also announced, including for Uncle Ben&#x27;s rice (which was renamed Ben&#x27;s Original), the Mrs. Butterworth&#x27;s pancake syrup brand and bottle shape, and the &quot;Rastus&quot; Black chef logo used by Cream of Wheat.

Descendants of Aunt Jemima models Lillian Richard and Anna Short Harrington objected to the change. Vera Harris, a family historian for Richard&#x27;s family, said &quot;I wish we would take a breath and not just get rid of everything. Because good or bad, it is our history.&quot; Harris further stated &quot;Erasing my Aunt Lillian Richard would erase a part of history.&quot; Harrington&#x27;s great-grandson Larnell Evans said &quot;This is an injustice for me and my family. This is part of my history.&quot; Evans had previously lost a lawsuit against Quaker Oats (and others) for billions of dollars in 2015.

On February 9, 2021, PepsiCo announced that the replacement brand name would be Pearl Milling Company. PepsiCo purchased that brand name for that purpose on February 1, 2021. The new branding was launched that June, one year after the company announced they would drop Aunt Jemima branding. PepsiCo referenced the Aunt Jemima brand by logotype on the front of the packaging for at least six months after the rebrand. Following that period, PepsiCo said it wouldn&#x27;t be able to completely permanently abandon the Aunt Jemima brand due to trademark law; if it did, a third party could obtain and use the brand.

==Character of Aunt Jemima==

Aunt Jemima is based on the common enslaved &quot;Mammy&quot; archetype, a plump black woman wearing a headscarf who is a devoted and submissive servant. Her skin is dark and dewy, with a pearly white smile. Although depictions vary over time, they are similar to the common attire and physical features of &quot;mammy&quot; characters throughout American history.

The terms &quot;aunt&quot; and &quot;uncle&quot; in this context were a Southern form of address used with older enslaved peoples. They were a denied use of English honorifics, such as &quot;mistress&quot; and &quot;mister&quot; respectively.

A British image in the Library of Congress, which may have been created as early as 1847, shows a smiling black woman named &quot;Miss Jim-Ima Crow&quot;, with a framed image of &quot;James Crow&quot; on the wall behind her. A character named &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; appeared on the stage in Washington, D.C., as early as 1864. Rutt&#x27;s inspiration for Aunt Jemima was Billy Kersands&#x27; American-style minstrelsy/vaudeville song &quot;Old Aunt Jemima&quot;, written in 1875. Rutt reportedly saw a minstrel show featuring the &quot;Old Aunt Jemima&quot; song in the fall of 1889, presented by blackface performers identified by Arthur F. Marquette as &quot;Baker &amp; Farrell&quot;. Marquette recounts that the actor playing Aunt Jemima wore an apron and kerchief.

However, Doris Witt at University of Iowa was unable to confirm Marquette&#x27;s account. Witt suggests that Rutt might have witnessed a performance by the vaudeville performer Pete F. Baker, who played characters described in newspapers of that era as &quot;Ludwig&quot; and &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;. His portrayal of the Aunt Jemima character may have been a white male in blackface, pretending to be a German immigrant, imitating a black minstrel parodying an imaginary black female enslaved cook.

===Advertising===
Marketing materials for the line of products centered around the &quot;Mammy&quot; archetype, including the slogan first used at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois: &quot;I&#x27;s in Town, Honey&quot;.

At that World&#x27;s Fair, and for decades afterward, marketers created and circulated fictional stories about Aunt Jemima. She was presented as a &quot;loyal cook&quot; for a fictional Colonel Higbee&#x27;s Louisiana plantation on the Mississippi River. Jemima was said to use a secret recipe &quot;from the South before the Civil War&quot;, with their &quot;matchless plantation flavor&quot;, to make the best pancakes in Dixie. Another story described her as diverting Union soldiers during the Civil War with her pancakes long enough for Colonel Higbee to escape. She was said to have revived a group of shipwrecked survivors with her flapjacks.

Beginning in 1894, the company added an Aunt Jemima paper doll family that could be cut out from the pancake box. Aunt Jemima is joined by her husband, Uncle Rastus (later renamed Uncle Mose to avoid confusion with the Cream of Wheat character, while Uncle Mose was first introduced as the plantation butler). Their children, described as &quot;comical pickaninnies&quot;: Abraham Lincoln, Dilsie, Zeb, and Dinah. The paper doll family was posed dancing barefoot, dressed in tattered clothing, and the box was labeled &quot;Before the Receipt was sold&quot;. ( is an archaic rural form of recipe.) Buying another box with elegant clothing cut-outs to fit over the dolls, the customer could transform them &quot;After the Receipt was sold&quot;. This placed them in the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches American cultural mythos.

Rag doll versions were offered as a premium in 1909: &quot;Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour / Pica ninny Doll / The Davis Milling Company&quot;. Early versions were portrayed as poor people with patches on their trousers, large mouths, and missing teeth. The children&#x27;s names were changed to Diana and Wade. Over time, there were improvements in appearance. Oil-cloth versions were available circa the 1950s, with cartoonish features, round eyes, and watermelon mouths.

A typical magazine ad from the turn of the century created by advertising executive James Webb Young, and the illustrator N.C. Wyeth, shows a heavyset black cook talking happily while a white man takes notes. The ad copy says, &quot;After the Civil War, after her master&#x27;s death, Aunt Jemima was finally persuaded to sell her famous pancake recipe to the representative of a northern milling company.&quot;

However, the Davis Milling Company was not located in a northern state. Missouri in the American Civil War was a hotly contested border state. In reality, she never existed, created by marketers to better sell products.

===Controversy===
Although the Aunt Jemima character was not created until nearly 25 years after the American Civil War, the clothing, dancing, enslaved dialect, and singing old plantation songs as she worked, all harkened back to a glorified view of antebellum Southern plantation life as a &quot;happy slave&quot; narrative. The marketing legend surrounding Aunt Jemima&#x27;s successful commercialization of her &quot;secret recipe&quot; contributed to the post-Civil War nostalgia and romanticism of Southern life in service of America&#x27;s developing consumer culture—especially in the context of selling kitchen items.

African American women formed the Women&#x27;s Columbian Association and the Women&#x27;s Columbian Auxiliary Association to address the exclusion of African Americans from the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair exhibitions, asking that the fair reflect the success of post-Emancipation African Americans. Instead, the Fair included a miniature West African village whose natives were portrayed as primitive savages. Ida B. Wells was incensed by the exclusion of African Americans from mainstream fair activities; the so-called &quot;Negro Day&quot; was a picnic held off-site from the fairgrounds.

Black scholars Hallie Quinn Brown, Anna Julia Cooper, and Fannie Barrier Williams used the World&#x27;s Fair as an opportunity to address how African American women were being exploited by white men. In her book &quot;A Voice from the South&quot; (1892), Cooper had noted the fascination with &quot;Southern influence, Southern ideas, and Southern ideals&quot; had &quot;dictated to and domineered over the brain and sinew of this nation&quot;.

These educated progressive women saw &quot;a mammy for the national household&quot; represented at the World&#x27;s Fair by Aunt Jemima. This directly relates to the belief that slavery cultivated innate qualities in African Americans. The notion that African Americans were natural servants reinforced a racist ideology renouncing the reality of African American intellect.

Aunt Jemima embodied a post-Reconstruction fantasy of idealized domesticity, inspired by &quot;happy slave&quot; hospitality, and revealed a deep need to redeem the antebellum South. There were others that capitalized on this theme, such as Uncle Ben&#x27;s Rice and Cream of Wheat&#x27;s Rastus.

===Slang===
The term &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; is sometimes used colloquially as a female version of the derogatory epithet &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; or &quot;Rastus&quot;. In this context, the slang term &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; falls within the &quot;mammy archetype&quot; and refers to a friendly black woman who is perceived as obsequiously servile or acting in, or protective of, the interests of whites.

John Sylvester of WTDY-AM drew criticism after calling Condoleezza Rice an &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; and Colin Powell an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, referring to remarks by singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte about their alleged subservience in the George W. Bush administration. He apologized by giving away Aunt Jemima&#x27;s pancake mix and syrup.

Barry Presgraves, then 77-year-old Mayor of Luray, Virginia, was censured 5-to-1 by the town council because he referred to Kamala Harris as &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; after she was selected by Joe Biden to be the Democratic Party vice presidential candidate.

==Performers of Aunt Jemima==
The African American Registry of the United States suggests Nancy Green and others who played the caricature of Aunt Jemima should be celebrated despite what has been widely condemned as a stereotypical and racist brand image. The registry wrote, &quot;We celebrate the birth of Nancy Green in 1834. She was a Black storyteller and one of the first Black corporate models in the United States.&quot;

Following Green&#x27;s work as Aunt Jemima, very few were well-known. Advertising agencies (such as J. Walter Thompson, Lord and Thomas, and others) hired dozens of actors to portray the role, often assigned regionally, as the first organized sales promotion campaign.

Quaker Oats ended local appearances for Aunt Jemima in 1965.

===Nancy Green===

Nancy Green was the first spokesperson hired by the R. T. Davis Milling Company for the Aunt Jemima pancake mix. Green was born into slavery in Montgomery County, Kentucky. Dressed as Aunt Jemima, Green appeared at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, beside the &quot;world&#x27;s largest flour barrel&quot; (24 feet high), where she operated a pancake-cooking display, sang songs, and told romanticized stories about the Old South (a happy place for blacks and whites alike). She appeared at fairs, festivals, flea markets, food shows, and local grocery stores, her arrival heralded by large billboards featuring the caption, &quot;I&#x27;se in town, honey.&quot;

Green refused to cross the ocean for the 1900 Paris exhibition. She was replaced by Agnes Moody. Green died in 1923 and was buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave in Chicago&#x27;s Oak Woods Cemetery. A headstone was placed on September 5, 2020.

===Agnes Moody===
60-year-old Agnes Moody first performed as Aunt Jemima at the 1900 Paris exhibition, and was erroneously reported as the original Aunt Jemima. She had become well known in the Chicago area for her cornmeal bread and cakes. She died April 9, 1903.

===Lillian Richard===
Lillian Richard was hired to portray Aunt Jemima in 1925, and remained in the role for 23 years. Richard was born in 1891, and grew up in the tiny community of Fouke 7 miles west of Hawkins in Wood County, Texas. In 1910, she moved to Dallas, working initially as a cook. Her job &quot;pitching pancakes&quot; was based in Paris, Texas. After she suffered a stroke &quot;circa&quot; 1947–1948, she returned to Fouke, where she lived until her death in 1956. Richard was honored with a Texas Historical Marker in her hometown, dedicated in her name on June 30, 2012.

Hawkins, Texas, east of Mineola, is known as the &quot;Pancake Capital of Texas&quot; because of longtime resident Lillian Richard. The local chamber of commerce decided to use Hawkins&#x27; connection to Aunt Jemima to boost tourism. In 1995, State Senator David Cain introduced Senate Resolution No. 73 designating Hawkins as the &quot;Pancake Capital of Texas&quot;, which was passed into law; the measure was spearheaded by Lillian&#x27;s niece, Jewell Richard-McCalla.

===Artie Belle McGinty===

In 1927, Artie Belle McGinty debuted as the original radio advertisement voice for Aunt Jemima.

===Anna Robinson===

Anna Robinson was hired to play Aunt Jemima at the 1933 Century of Progress Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Robinson answered an open audition, and her appearance was more like the &quot;mammy&quot; stereotype than the slender Lillian Richard. Born circa 1899, she was also from Kentucky and widowed (like Green), but in her 30s with 8 years of education. She was sent to New York City by Lord and Thomas to have her picture taken. A 1967 company history commemorated this journey as &quot;the day they loaded 350 pounds of Anna Robinson on the Twentieth Century Limited.&quot;

She appeared at prestigious establishments frequented by the rich and famous, such as El Morocco, the Stork Club, &quot;21&quot;, and the Waldorf-Astoria. Photos show Robinson making pancakes for celebrities and stars of Broadway, radio, and motion pictures. They were used in advertising &quot;ranked among the highest read of their time&quot;. The Aunt Jemima packaging was redesigned in her likeness.

Robinson reportedly worked for the company until her death in 1951; however, the work, which was sporadic and for mere weeks in a year, was not enough to escape the hard life into which she had been born. Her $1,200 total payment in 1939 () was almost the entirety of the household&#x27;s annual income and stood in stark contrast to the official Aunt Jemima history timeline, which stated that Robinson was &quot;able to make enough money to provide for her children and buy a 22-room house where she rents rooms to boarders&quot;. The same claim was made for Anna Short Harrington, yet according to the 1940 census, she rented an apartment in a four-flat in Washington Park with her daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren.

===Rosa Washington Riles===
Rosa Washington Riles became the third face on Aunt Jemima packaging in the 1930s, and continued until 1948. Rosa Washington was born in 1901 near Red Oak in Brown County, Ohio, one of several children of Robert and Julie (Holliday) Washington and a granddaughter of George and Phoeba Washington. She was employed as a cook in the home of a Quaker Oats executive and began pancake demonstrations at her employer&#x27;s request. She died in 1969, and is buried near her parents and grandparents in the historic Red Oak Presbyterian Church cemetery of Ripley, Ohio. An annual Aunt Jemima breakfast has been a long-time fundraiser for the cemetery, and the church maintains a collection of Aunt Jemima memorabilia.

===Anna Short Harrington===

Anna Short Harrington began her career as Aunt Jemima in 1935 and continued to play the role until 1954. She was born in 1897 in Marlboro County, South Carolina. The Short family lived on the Pegues Place plantation as sharecroppers. In 1927, she moved to Syracuse, New York. Quaker Oats discovered her cooking pancakes at the 1935 New York State Fair. Harrington died in Syracuse in 1955.

===Edith Wilson===

Edith Wilson was the face of Aunt Jemima on radio, television, and in personal appearances, from 1948 to 1966 and was the first Aunt Jemima to appear in television commercials. Born in 1896 in Louisville, Kentucky, Wilson was a classic blues singer and actress in Chicago, New York, and London. She appeared on radio in &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, on radio and television in &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, and on film in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944). Wilson died in Chicago on March 31, 1981.

===Ethel Ernestine Harper===

Ethel Ernestine Harper portrayed Aunt Jemima during the 1950s. Harper was born on September 17, 1903, in Greensboro, Alabama. After graduating from college at the age of 17, she taught elementary school for 2 years and high school mathematics for 10 years. She then moved to New York City, where she performed in &quot;The Hot Mikado&quot; in 1939. She also appeared in &quot;Harlem Cavalcade&quot; in 1942 and toured Europe during and after World War II as one of the Ginger Snaps. Harper, who was the last individual model for the character&#x27;s logo, died in Morristown, New Jersey on March 31, 1979.

===Rosie Lee Moore Hall===
Rosie Lee Moore Hall, the last &quot;living&quot; Aunt Jemima, was born in Robertson County, Texas on June 22, 1899. She was working in the Quaker Oats&#x27; advertising department in Oklahoma when she answered their search for a new Aunt Jemima. Hall portrayed Aunt Jemima from 1950 until her death (on her way to church) from a heart attack on February 12, 1967. She was buried in the family plot in the Colony Cemetery near Wheelock, Texas. On May 7, 1988, her grave was declared an historical landmark.

===Aylene Lewis===
Aylene Lewis portrayed Aunt Jemima at the Disneyland Aunt Jemima&#x27;s Pancake House, a popular eating place at the park on New Orleans Street in Frontierland, from 1957 until her death in 1964. Lewis became well known posing for pictures with visitors and serving pancakes to dignitaries, such as Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. She also developed a close relationship with Walt Disney.

==In popular culture==

Aunt Jemima has been featured in various formats and settings throughout popular culture. Aunt Jemima has been a present image identifiable by popular culture for well over a century, dating back to Nancy Green&#x27;s appearance at the 1893 World Fair in Chicago, Illinois.

&quot;Aunt Jemima&quot;, a minstrel-type variety radio program, was broadcast January 17, 1929 – June 5, 1953, at times on CBS and at other times on the Blue Network. The program had several hiatuses during its time on the air.

The 1933 novel &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; by Fannie Hurst features an Aunt Jemima-type character, Delilah, a maid struggling in life with her widowed employer, Bea. Their fortunes change dramatically when Bea capitalizes on Delilah&#x27;s family pancake recipe to open a pancake restaurant that attracts tourists at the Jersey Shore. It became a great success and was eventually packaged and sold as Aunt Delilah&#x27;s Pancake Mix. They achieve that success due to selling flour with a smiling Delilah on the box dressed in Aunt Jemima fashion. The Academy Award-nominated 1934 film version of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; starring Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers retains this part of the plot, which was excised from the 1959 remake of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; starring Lana Turner and directed by Douglas Sirk.

In the 1960s, Betye Saar began collecting images of Aunt Jemima, Uncle Tom, Little Black Sambo, and other stereotyped African-American figures from folk culture and advertising of the Jim Crow era. She incorporated them into collages and assemblages, transforming them into statements of political and social protest.
The Liberation of Aunt Jemima is one of her most notable works from this era. In this mixed-media assemblage, Saar utilized the stereotypical mammy figure of Aunt Jemima to subvert traditional notions of race and gender.

&quot;Aunt Jemima&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;—named Aunt Jemima&#x27;s Pancake House when it first started operating in 1955—was a restaurant opened in 1962 during the Civil Rights Movement as the official Aunt Jemima restaurant at Disneyland. In addition to the restaurant, a woman portraying Aunt Jemima was poised at the restaurant to take pictures with its patrons. Aunt Jemima&#x27;s Kitchen also had additional locations across the United States.

The Aunt Jemima character, portrayed at the time by Edith Wilson, received the Key to the City of Albion, Michigan, on January 25, 1964. Actresses portraying Aunt Jemima visited Albion, Battle Creek (&quot;Cereal City&quot;), and other Michigan cities many times over three decades. Grand Rapids had an Aunt Jemima&#x27;s Kitchen, one of 21 locations, until it was changed to Colonial Kitchen in 1968.

Frank Zappa includes a song titled &quot;Electric Aunt Jemima&quot; on his 1969 album &quot;Uncle Meat&quot;. Electric Aunt Jemima was the nickname for Zappa&#x27;s Standel guitar amplifier.

Faith Ringgold&#x27;s first quilt story &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Aunt Jemima?&quot; (1983) depicts the story of Aunt Jemima as a matriarch restaurateur: through mediums of text and imagery used to characterize Aunt Jemima in the public sphere, Ringgold represented the oppressed mammy caricature as an entrepreneur.

&quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; on Public Enemy&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; features Big Daddy Kane commenting on the updating of racial tropes with the lyrics, &quot;And black women in this profession / As for playin&#x27; a lawyer, out of the question / For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term / Even if now she got a perm.&quot;
Spike Lee&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Bamboozled&quot; features Aunt Jemima (played by Tyheesha Collins) as one of the dancing &quot;pickaninnies&quot; in the film&#x27;s deliberately racist TV show &quot;Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show&quot;, alongside other stereotypical black antebellum South characters like Rastus.

The 2004 mockumentary &quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot; features numerous depictions of Aunt Jemima-type characters as slaves (referred to as servants) in an alternate timeline in which the Confederacy won the American Civil War.

In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Gluten Free Ebola&quot; (2014), Aunt Jemima appears in Eric Cartman&#x27;s delirious dream to tell him that the food pyramid is upside down.

On November 7, 2020, the comedy sketch TV series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a skit in which Aunt Jemima was fired, in addition to Uncle Ben, with roles played by &quot;Count Chocula&quot; and the &quot;Allstate Guy&quot;.

In the 2021 film, &quot;Judas and the Black Messiah,&quot; a police officer disparagingly compares a passing Black woman to Aunt Jemima, in a scene where Chicago Police are surrounding the Black Panther Party Headquarters.

<doc id="484156" wikidata="Q7667610" url="?curid=484156" title="Sōran Bushi">
<text>is one of the most famous traditional songs and dance (&quot;min&#x27;yō&quot;) in Japan. It is a sea shanty that is said to have been first sung by the fishermen of Hokkaido.

The commonly known version of the song and dance is called and was created in 1991 at the Wakkanai Minami Junior High School. It uses the song and text of  Takio Ito&#x27;s &quot;Takio no Sōran Bushi&quot; from 1988, which is a modernized version of the original song with a faster rhythm and a more modern music and text. The choreography was developed by the Butoh dancer Jushō Kasuga, which includes acting ocean waves, fishermen dragging nets, pulling ropes and lifting luggage over their shoulders. The school received an honorable mention at the Folk Song and Dance Awards National Convention in 1992, and one year later the Grand Prix of the Prime Minister of Japan. This made the song and dance nationally known, so that this dance is taught in many schools across Japan as part of the curriculum.

During regular intervals of the dance, the words &quot;&quot;Dokkoisho&quot;! &quot;Dokkoisho&quot;!&quot; and &quot;&quot;Soran&quot;! &quot;Soran&quot;!&quot; are called. Those words were used in the past to encourage the fisherman during their work.

An excerpt from one of the many text versions of &quot;Sōran Bushi&quot;

Japanese (Rōmaji):

Yāren sōran sōran
Sōran sōran sōran (hai hai!)
Nishin kita ka to kamome ni toeba,
Watasha tatsu tori nami ni kike choi.

CHORUS (&quot;kakegoe&quot;)
Yasa e en ya sa dokkoisho
(a dokkoisho, dokkoisho!)

Yāren sōran...
Oyaji tairyō da mukashi to chigau
toreta nishin wa ore no mono choi

Yāren sōran...

Rough English Translation:

&quot; Oh!!! Soran, soran, soran&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; soran, soran, soran. (yes, yes!)&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; When we hear the jabbering of seagulls on the high seas,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; we know we can’t give up our fishing lives on the ocean.&quot;

&quot; CHORUS&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Put your backs into it! Heave, ho! Heave, ho!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; (Heave, ho! Heave, ho!)

&quot; Oh!!! Soran...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Boss, I tell you, the size of this catch of herring&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; is different from all the others. And it&#x27;s all MINE.&quot;

&quot; Oh!!! Soran...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Even if I row four and a half metres,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; I couldn&#x27;t get that girl&#x27;s attention.&quot;

&quot; Oh!!! Soran...&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; A flighty seagull twitters in excitement&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; As it sees my bare skin, glistening with ocean surf.&quot;

<text>Earl John &quot;Tommy&quot; Thomson (February 15, 1895 – May 19, 1971) was a Canadian athlete, a specialist in the high hurdles. In 1920 he became the first Olympic gold medalist in 110 m hurdles from outside the United States.

==Biography==
Born in Birch Hills, Northwest Territories (now in Saskatchewan), Thomson moved to southern California at age 8, because the warm weather would be better for his mother. Thomson attended Long Beach Poly, where he won the 120 yard hurdles at the first CIF California State Meet in 1915. He also was second in the high jump and fourth in the discus throw. In 1916 he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and served there during World War I. He then went to the University of Southern California for one year and then transferred to Dartmouth College. He graduated from there in 1922. In 1918, he had already won the AAU championships in the high hurdles, and in 1920, he set a new world record in the 110 m hurdles, running 14.4. This record would remain unbeaten until 1931, although it was equaled a number of times. He sought to represent the United States at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, but was ruled ineligible due to his Canadian citizenship. He then joined the Canadian Olympic team.

At the Olympics, Thomson won a clear victory over his American rivals. The following year, he equaled his own world record, and won the AAU, IC4A and NCAA championships. That year he also won the 220 yard low hurdles. He retired after his third AAU title, in 1922.

Later, Thomson became a track and field coach, coaching the team of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland for 36 years.

In 1930 Thomson, along with Harold Barron and Harry Hillman, was involved in the design of a new safer hurdle, with a view to reducing the danger of bad falls and injuries.

Thomson was an inaugural inductee to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955. He died of cancer in Oceanside, California aged 76.

<text>Ia Drang River (), also known as the Prêk Drang in Cambodia, is a tributary of the Srepok River in the Mekong river system that flows through Vietnam and Cambodia.

The river originates from the hills in southern Pleiku, the provincial capital of Gia Lai province in the Central Highlands region of Vietnam. It then flows southwestwards, through Chư Prông district and enters the Ou Ya Dav District of Ratanakiri province in northeast Cambodia, before joining the Srepok River.

The valley northeast of the Chư Prông massif, through which the river flows, is the site of the Battle of Ia Drang in November 1965, during the Vietnam War.

<doc id="484162" wikidata="Q5301586" url="?curid=484162" title="Douglas Henderson (SNP politician)">
<text>Douglas Henderson (16 July 1935 – 15 September 2006) was a Scottish politician. He was Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1971 to 1973 and from 1979 to 1981. He served as a Scottish National Party Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire from 1974 to 1979, and held virtually every national office in the SNP, short of party leader. His political style has been described as &quot;no-nonsense&quot; and &quot;very blunt and forthright&quot;. He was also known for his forceful public speaking, which former SNP leader Alex Salmond described as &quot;messianic&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Henderson was born in Edinburgh, the son of a railway porter. He won a scholarship to attend the Royal High School and was then awarded a bursary which allowed him to attend the University of Edinburgh from 1952 to 1957. He graduated from Edinburgh with an MA and an LLB.

He worked as a management consultant in the UK and overseas. He married Maureen Ferguson in Johannesburg in 1960 and had four children, but they were later divorced. In later life, his home and business partner was English fashion designer Betty Davies; together, they founded Scottish Fashion International.

In later years, he regularly attended St Giles Cathedral, where his funeral was held on 7 October 2006.

==Political career==

=== Early career (1970–1983)===
Henderson became a supporter of Scottish independence at an early age, and joined the SNP aged 14. He was President of the Edinburgh University Nationalist Club. Henderson became heavily involved with the SNP after he returned to Scotland from South Africa in the mid-1960s. He was also the director of programmes for Radio Free Scotland from 1963 to 1965, and was Senior vice-chairman (depute leader) of the SNP from 1970 to 1972. He was selected as the SNP candidate for East Aberdeenshire in 1972, and moved to live in the constituency, developing links with local fishermen, farmers and businessmen. He was elected at the February 1974 general election, and re-elected in the October general election later that year. The SNP were in the ascendent, campaigning on the basis of &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot;.

Henderson served as the whip and was a leading member of the group of 11 SNP MPs in the House of Commons. In 1975, he negotiated a position for the SNP&#x27;s Winnie Ewing in the British delegation to the European Parliament, where she became known as &quot;Madame Ecosse&quot;. He was later the SNP spokesman on employment and industry. He was instrumental in the SNP&#x27;s decision to lay down a censure motion in the House of Commons, criticising the Labour government of James Callaghan after 1 March 1979 referendum vote on Scottish devolution failed to be approved by the required 40% of the electorate. At the time, the Labour government were reliant upon support from the SNP. The motion was carried by one vote on 28 March and Callaghan immediately called the general election which brought the Conservative Party led by Margaret Thatcher to power. Callaghan described the actions of the SNP as &quot;turkeys voting for Christmas&quot;. Henderson lost his seat to Conservative Albert McQuarrie in the 1979 general election by less than 600 votes, and only two MPs from the SNP remained in the new Parliament.

He returned to his business career, but with less success than the 1960s. At the SNP Conference in 1979, he was elected the party&#x27;s Senior vice-chairman (now described as deputy leader) (to leader Gordon Wilson), defeating Margo MacDonald for the post. He remained in this position until 1981, when he stood down on health grounds.

He fought the new seat of Banff and Buchan, which had largely replaced Aberdeenshire East in the 1983 general election. He again lost to Albert McQuarrie by less than 1,000 votes. The 1983 election saw the SNP only win the two seats that they had held in 1979, but Banff and Buchan was one of three that they came close to recapturing from the Conservatives. Future SNP leader Alex Salmond would win this constituency from 1987, and it would remain in SNP hands until 2017. Henderson also suffered in his private life, being divorced in the early 1980s.

===Later revival (1998–2006)===
He was out of active politics for a long period as a result of misdiagnosed illness. He had a major operation in 1998 for cancer, and then several months of chemotherapy, before he was able to resume his political duties for the SNP.

He contested the 2004 European Parliament election for the SNP but was not elected as he was placed fourth on the party&#x27;s list and they gained only two seats. He also contested the Dumfries and Galloway seat at the 2005 general election, finishing third behind Russell Brown, the Labour candidate and Peter Duncan the Conservative candidate.

In September 2005, following the retirement of Winnie Ewing, he stood for the post of SNP President, losing to Ian Hudghton, Member of the European Parliament, but finishing ahead of onetime president William Wolfe. He was however successful in being elected as one of six ordinary members of the SNP&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

He was selected to fight the Falkirk East constituency for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, and was ranked fourth on the SNP&#x27;s Central Scotland regional list. He died after a short illness in 2006, before the election could take place.

<text>Dr William Laurence Wilson (born 11 December 1963) is a former Scottish National Party (SNP) politician. He was a regional list Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the West of Scotland region from 2007 to 2011. He left the SNP in 2017 and now serves as co-convener of the Edinburgh Branch of the Scottish Green Party.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Paisley in 1963 and attended Shawlands Academy, the University of Glasgow, University of Aberdeen, and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. While living in Oxford, employed in conservation by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust and the University of Oxford, he became politically involved with the Labour Party. Upon returning to his native Scotland he became convinced of the case for Scottish independence and that the Labour Party&#x27;s commitment to social justice was waning. In 1989 he joined the Scottish National Party (SNP).

==Candidature and leadership challenge==
He stood unsuccessfully as an SNP candidate for the House of Commons in the Glasgow Anniesland constituency in the 1997 General Election before standing in the Glasgow Maryhill constituency in both the 1999 and 2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections. Wilson was also elected chair of the SNP&#x27;s Glasgow Regional Association in 2001.

In the aftermath of the SNP&#x27;s poor election performance in 2003, Wilson became convinced that a change of direction was needed by the SNP leadership. After discussing this with various SNP members, he was persuaded to contest the leadership himself and launched a challenge against the SNP leader, John Swinney. His campaign focused on the issue of centralising the control of the party away from the branches and activists, and what he argued was the trend of placing the SNP ideologically in the centre ground of politics, away from the party&#x27;s traditional position on the left-of-centre.

In the leadership contest that ensued at the SNP&#x27;s 2003 Conference Swinney received 577 votes from those delegates voting to Wilson&#x27;s 111 to remain leader. There were 17 &quot;positive abstentions&quot; (delegates present who voted in other ballots that day) and 60 non-voters. However, the following year Swinney resigned after sustained media speculation that he was unsuitable for the role. The immediate catalyst for Swinney&#x27;s resignation was the SNP&#x27;s poor performance in the elections to the European Parliament, although many spectators commented that Wilson&#x27;s challenge also contributed to his resignation.

Shortly after the leadership contest he stood down as convenor of the SNP Glasgow Regional Association and was replaced in that position by his leadership campaign manager. Wilson stood as the SNP candidate for the Paisley and Renfrewshire North constituency for the 2005 UK general election. He finished in second place behind James Sheridan of the Labour Party.

==As an MSP==
At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Wilson stood in the West Renfrewshire constituency and also on the party list for the West of Scotland region. In West Renfrewshire he came third, the SNP dropping behind the Conservatives who took second place to Labour. He was elected on the regional list and sworn in as a Member of the Scottish Parliament.

Wilson&#x27;s maiden speech to the Scottish Parliament, delivered on 6 June 2007, underlined his belief in the links between crime and deprivation and his commitment to social justice.

His campaigns have included awareness of the negative health impact of depleted uranium on service personnel and civilians, equity fines for corporate crimes, as well as promotion of Scots language.

==Joining the Scottish Greens==
Following the 2017 General Election campaign Wilson left the SNP and subsequently joined the Scottish Green Party. On 28 June 2018 he was elected Co-Convener of the Edinburgh Branch of the Scottish Greens, standing down in 2019. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election he stood on the Lothian List for the Scottish Green Party as the 10th of 12 candidates. The party won two seats in the region.
