<text>The Karachays or Karachais ( or , , &#x27;mountaineers&#x27;) are an indigenous North Caucasian-Turkic ethnic group native to the North Caucasus. They are primarily located in their ancestral lands in Karachay–Cherkess Republic, a republic of Russia in the North Caucasus. They have a common origin, culture, and language with the Balkars.

==History==
According to Balkar historian, ethnographer and archaeologist who was a specialist in the field of North Caucasian studies, the theories on the origins of the Karachays and the neighboring Balkars is among &quot;one of the most difficult problems in Caucasian studies,&quot; due to the fact that they are &quot;a Turk-speaking people occupying the most Alpine regions of Central Caucasus, living in an environment of Caucasian and Iranian (Ossetian) languages.&quot; Many scientists and historians have made attempts to study the issue, but &quot;the complexity of a problem lead to numerous hypotheses, often contradicting each other.&quot; He concluded that &quot;Balkarians and Karachais are among the most ancient nationalities of Caucasus. The roots of their history and culture are intimately intertwined with the history and culture of many Caucasian peoples, as well as numerous Turk nationalities, from Yakutia to Turkey, from Azerbaijan to Tatarstan, from the Kumik and Nogai to the Altai and Hakass.&quot;

Ankara University&#x27;s professor Ufuk Tavkul, another specialist, locates that the ethnogenesis of Karachays-Balkars and Kumyks inside the Caucasus, not outside; he then succinctly describes the ethnogenesis of peoples of the Caucasus, including the Karachays and Balkars, thus:

Other research by Boulygina et al. (2020) shows Karachays&#x27; genetic connection to the pre-historic Koban culture. A recent genetic study states the following: &quot;Balkars and Karachays belong to the Caucasian anthropological type. According to the results of craniology, somatology, odontology, and dermatoglyphics, the native (Caucasian) origin of the Balkars and Karachays and their kinship with the representatives of neighboring ethnic groups and a minor role of the Central Asian component in their ethnogenesis were concluded.&quot;

The state of Alania was established prior to the Mongol invasions and had its capital in Maghas, which some authors locate in Arkhyz, the mountains currently inhabited by the Karachay, while others place it in either what is now modern Ingushetia or North Ossetia. In the 14th century, Alania was destroyed by Timur and the decimated population dispersed into the mountains.

In the nineteenth century Russia took over the area during the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. On October 20, 1828 the Battle of Khasauka took place, in which the Russian troops were under the command of General Georgy Emanuel. The day after the battle, as Russian troops were approaching the &quot;aul&quot; of Kart-Dzhurt, the Karachay elders met with the Russian leaders and an agreement was reached for the inclusion of the Karachay into the Russian Empire.

After annexation, the self-government of Karachay was left intact, including its officials and courts. Interactions with neighboring Muslim peoples continued to take place based on both folk customs and Sharia law. In Karachay, soldiers were taken from Karachai Amanat, pledged an oath of loyalty, and were assigned arms.

From 1831 to 1860, the Karachays were divided. A large portion of Karachays joined the anti-Russian struggles carried out by the North Caucasian peoples; while another significant portion of Karachays, due to being encouraged by the Volga Tatars and Bashkirs, another fellow Turkic Muslim peoples that have long loyal to Russia, voluntarily cooperated with Russian authorities in the Caucasian War. Between 1861 and 1880, to escape reprisals by the Russian army, some Karachays migrated to the Ottoman Empire although most Karachays remain in modern territory. 

All Karachay officials were purged by early 1938, and the entire nation was administered by NKVD officers, none of whom were Karachay. In addition, the entire intelligentsia, all rural officials and at least 8,000 ordinary farmers were arrested, including 875 women. Most were executed, but many were sent to prison camps throughout the Caucasus.

During the parade of sovereignties and the collapse of the USSR on November 30, 1990, KCHAO withdrew from the Stavropol Territory and became the Karachay-Cherkess Soviet Socialist Republic (KChSSR) as part of the RSFSR, which was approved by a resolution of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR on July 3, 1991.

In 1989–1997, the Karachay national movements appealed to the leadership of the RSFSR with a request to restore a separate autonomy of Karachay.

On November 18, 1990, at the congress of Karachay deputies of all levels, the Karachay Soviet Socialist Republic (since October 17, 1991 — the Karachay Republic) was proclaimed as part of the RSFSR, which was not recognized by the leadership of the RSFSR. On March 28, 1992, a referendum was held in which, according to the official results, the majority of the population of Karachay-Cherkessia opposed the division. The division was not legalized, and a single Karachay-Cherkessia remained.

===Deportation===
In 1942 the Germans permitted the establishment of a Karachay National Committee to administer their &quot;autonomous region&quot;; the Karachays were also allowed to form their own police force and establish a brigade that was to fight with the Wehrmacht. This relationship with Nazi Germany resulted, when the Russians regained control of the region in November 1943, with the Karachays being charged with collaboration with Nazi Germany and deported. Originally restricted only to family members of rebel bandits during World War II, the deportation was later expanded to include the entire Karachay ethnic group. The Soviet government refused to acknowledge that 20,000 Karachays served in the Red Army, greatly outnumbering the 3,000 estimated to have collaborated with the German soldiers. Karachays were forcibly deported and resettled in Central Asia, mostly in Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. In the first two years of the deportations, disease and famine caused the death of 35% of the population; of 28,000 children, 78%, or almost 22,000 perished.

===Diaspora===
About 10,000–15,756 Karachays and Balkars emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, with their migration reaching peaks in 1884–87, 1893, and 1905–06. 

Karachays were also forcibly displaced to the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s relocation campaign in 1944. Since the Nikita Khrushchev era in the Soviet Union, the majority of Karachays have been repatriated to their homeland from Central Asia. Today, there are sizable Karachay communities in Turkey (centered on Afyonkarahisar), Uzbekistan, the United States, and Germany.

==Geography==
The Karachay nation, along with the Balkars occupy the valleys and foothills of the Central Caucasus in the river valleys of the Kuban, Big Zelenchuk River, Malka, Baksan, Cherek, and others.

The Karachays are very proud of the symbol of their nation, Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in Europe, with an altitude of 5,642 meters.

==Culture==
Like other peoples in the mountainous Caucasus, the relative isolation of the Karachay allowed them to develop their particular cultural practices, despite general accommodation with surrounding groups.

Karachay people live in communities that are divided into families and clans (&quot;tukums&quot;). A &quot;tukum&quot; is based on a family&#x27;s lineage and there are roughly thirty-two Karachay &quot;tukums&quot;. Prominent &quot;tukums&quot; include: Abayhan, Aci, Batcha (Batca), Baychora, Bayrimuk (Bayramuk), Bostan, Catto (Jatto), Cosar (Çese), Duda, Hubey (Hubi), Karabash, Kochkar, Laypan, Lepshoq, Ozden (Uzden), Silpagar, Tebu, Teke, Toturkul, Urus.

===Language===
Karachays speak the Karachay-Balkar language, which comes from the northwestern branch of Turkic languages. The Kumyks, who live in northeast Dagestan, speak a closely related language, the Kumyk language.

===Religion===
The majority of the Karachay are followers of Islam. Some Karachays began adopting Islam in the 17th and 18th centuries due to contact with the Nogais, the Crimean Tatars, and most significantly, the Circassians. The Sufi Qadiriya order has a presence in the region.

<text>Balkars ( or таулула, , &#x27;mountaineers&#x27;) are a Turkic ethnic group in the North Caucasus region, one of the titular populations of Kabardino-Balkaria.

Their Karachay-Balkar language is of the Ponto-Caspian subgroup of the Northwestern (Kipchak) group of Turkic languages.

== Identity ==
The modern Balkars are a Turkic people, who share their language with the Karachays from Karachay-Cherkessia and have strong lingual similarities with Kumyks from Dagestan.

Sometimes Balkars and Karachays are referred to as a single ethnicity.

==History==
===Ethnogenesis===

The ethnogenesis of the Balkars resulted, in part, from:
* The Bulgars who lived in Old Great Bulgaria, ruled by Khan Kubrat. Batbayan was the only one of Kubrat&#x27;s sons who remained in the Caucasus with the Balkars, while his four brothers moved from Balkaria and went to the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula and the Volga River.
* The intrusion of Alania during the 11th century, and the Kipchak Turks with their Cuman allies. Alania had its capital in Maghas, which some authors and historians locate at today’s Arkhyz, in the mountains currently inhabited by the Karachay-Balkar, while others place it in either what is now modern Ingushetia or North Ossetia.

While acknowledging contributions by Bulgars and Kipchaks (among many others), Tavkul (2015) locates the ethnogenesis of Balkars-Karachays and other peoples of the Caucasus inside the Caucasus, not outside.

During the 14th century, Alania was destroyed by Timur. Many of the Alans, Cumans, and Kipchaks migrated westward into Europe. While the majority of remaining Alans fled south, deep into the mountains. Timur&#x27;s incursion into the North Caucasus introduced the remaining to Islam and the process of intermixing and Ethnogenesis.

Most Balkars adopted Islam in the eighteenth century due to contact with the Kumyks, Circassians, Nogais, and Crimean Tatars. The Balkars are considered deeply religious. The Sufi Qadiriya order has a strong presence in the region.

=== Caucasian War ===

The Balkars and Karachays have been helping the Kabardians in their rebellions since ancient times. Thus, in 1787, Kabard&#x27;s bailiff wrote: &quot;The Kabardians, in cases of close, always find their shelter and shelter of estates with them (the Balkars)“.

During the uprising in Kabarda of the primary bridles of the Kudenetovs, in the battle of May 9, 1804 on the river Chegem, the Karachays and Balkars came to the rescue, Lieutenant General Glazenap himself in a report to the Russian Emperor Alexander I reported that the battle lasted from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., noting:

&quot;...Fought in the gorges for the most part with 11,000 desperately fighting Kabardians, Chegemians, Balkars, Karachays and Ossetians knocked out of 12 dug-out auls&quot;

In the subsequent uprising of Kabarda, which was in 1810, the Balkars again did not deny help, on April 30, General Bulgakov reported from the camp to the river. Cherek:

&quot;Their armed gathering of more than 2,000 horsemen and as many as pedestrians can be heard, with the help of the Balkars held in two fortified gorges at the foot of the snowy mountains, is locked by me.&quot;

The following years did not pass quietly either, the Karachays, for example, were engaged in robbery. In June 1822. Yermolov told Major General Stal:

&quot;I&#x27;m sure, Your Excellency, that you will visit them if they continue to rob and don&#x27;t want to evict&quot;

And so, in 1828, the village of Nezlobnaya was brought together by fugitive Kabardians, Karachays, Balkars and other outer Kubans, on the way back a detachment of highlanders met with imperial forces, and there was a battle, in Georgi Emmanuel&#x27;s report about these events it is written:

&quot;At the same time, I dare to witness to V.I.V. the excellent courage shown by all our troops, who were in this case, against the selected only in a large number of mountaineers, who were in shells and fought with incredible effort, attacking artillery, such examples have never happened before&quot;

In the same year, Emmanuel undertook an expedition to Karachay, the expedition lasted from October 17 to 29, a contingent was introduced into Karachay, the strength of which was more than 3,000 combat units with 15 guns, the final battle took place on October 20 near the village of Kart-Jurt. In official sources, the losses of Russian Empire amounted to 262 killed and wounded in unofficial sources up to 800 killed and wounded.

After the battle, the Karachay people gave Amanats and accepted the conditions of the Empire:

&quot;1) Obeying the will of Your Excellency, we undertake from now on not to be guilty of anything against Russia, and guilty people, such as: Kabardians and others, not to accept them at all, and not to join them; to always be loyal to the Russian throne and to confirm with an oath, to return everything stolen by us in advance by people, cattle and other property without seizure under oath.

2) In the certificate of the above, we give from the four surnames of the Amanates appointed by you.

3) If a large Circassian army will pass through our lands to invade Russia, which we will not be able to keep, we will not be accused of, but only immediately we are obliged to let us know about it, and we are responsible for those we will be able to keep.

4) If anyone has Muslims like us from the subjects of the Russian Emperor, no matter what claim is against us or we are against them, let us understand our customs, sheriat.

5) For exchange and trade, establish us on the river Kume, near the fortress of Akhandukovskaya, exchange yard, so that we can get salt, iron, goods and bread there and would be allowed to enter Russia according to our needs&quot;

Despite this, in 1830–1831, there was an agreement between the Circassians, Karachays, Balkars and Abazins that they would help each other, and the general ambassador and representative of these peoples, or rather 12 provinces, Sefer Bey Zanoko was chosen. On this occasion, James Bell writes in 1837:

&quot;The Circassians are convinced that their main, if not the only, hope rests on themselves and on their own swords. Therefore, they are preparing to continue the war against Russia on their own. To this end, Sefir Bey, the most prominent of their princes, Judge Haji-Oku Mehmet and other influential and high-ranking persons went on a tour of the provinces. Everywhere they were met by a meeting of special representatives who, under oath, committed themselves on behalf of their communities to remain faithful to each other and reject all conditions of obedience, whatever they may be and what Russia may offer, unless they are authorized by their general approval. At the same time, they granted the prince and judge the title of ambassadors to try to get help for themselves from abroad, specifically instructing the first to stay abroad to finally achieve this goal. It was especially stipulated that no change could be made to the provision of the treaty without the consent or even the presence of Sefir Bey. It has been almost seven years since he has been absent and since nothing says that he is going to return under the current circumstances (which cannot be explained by a sense of fear, since everyone agrees to recognize him as the bravest of the brave), he reminds us of the legislator who forced his subjects to swear to obey his laws before his return and who then left his country forever. The league, of which Sefir Bay was appointed ambassador, consisted of the following twelve provinces: Natuhach, Shapsug, Abaza, Psadug, Temirgoy, Khatukoy, Makosh, Besni, Bashilbay, Teberdekh, Braki and Karachay.

The Karachay-Balkars continued to be active until 1833, as well as to support the Kuban Circassians, thanks to which the Amanates received by Emmanuel in 1828 were sent in early 1833 to the Dmitrievsky semi-battalion of military cantonists:

&quot;The Karachay people live in the tops of the Kuban River, the population of it can be put up to 5,000 souls, which are divided into two classes: the elders and the free people. The Karachay people have repeatedly raided themselves or together with other highlanders on our borders. In 1828, the general from the cavalry Emanuel penetrated the lands and took the Amanats from them as a pledge of loyalty, but as they continued to pass predators through their lands and some of them personally participated in predation, their Amanates were sent in early 1833 to the Dmitrievsky semi-battalion of military cantonists. According to their situation, the Karachay people can contribute a lot to ensuring the tranquility of the neighborhoods of Mineralnye Vody and Kabarda, in order to have time to convince them to this, I allowed the staff captain Prince Shakhovsky to promise them that their former Amanates will be returned if they again express submission on favorable terms for us. What they promised to do:

1. To give one amanat from the elders and the free people.

2. To accept one of the Kabardian princes loyal to us as a bailiff, so that during the passage of predatory parties with the Zakuban princes, the Karachay people could raise their weapons to the princely families, because according to the ancient custom of some highlanders, the common people cannot fight with the princes without having an order from their equal family.

3. Stop any friendly relationship with the mountaineers who are hostile to us, to keep guards from the tops of the Caucasus Mountains to the Morzhisin River, which is near the stone bridge in the Kuban, and to keep predatory parties not exceeding thousands of people, if there are more of them, then let the Urusbians and the nearest military post know.

4. If predatory parties break through below the Marzhisina River, the nearest military authorities are obliged to notify the Karachay bailiff so that he can take appropriate measures to assist in case of persecution of predators by Russian troops. If the government considers it necessary to bring troops into the Karachay lands, they should assist them as much as possible.

During the ongoing negotiations between Prince Shakhovsky and the elders, this Karachay people proved their diligence and benefits that can be expected from their sincere devotion. A party of predators, crossing the Kuban, stole 6 rams and 60 cattle from Kabardia and captured three boys; the most honorable of the elders of the Karachays, the seventy-year-old Krimshamkhalov from 30 of his men rushed into the chase, caught up the predators and despite the fact that there were 140 people, stopped and held them until he received reinforcements from the people, then, having beaten off all the prey from them, returned the Kabardians according to belonging.

In the following years, the Karachays and the Balkars secretly kept in touch with the Kubans, so the English official Edmund Spencer says, who visited the Western Caucasus in 1836 while visiting one of the representatives of the mountain tribes hostile to Russia, who lived in close proximity to Sukhum-Kale, Pitsunda and Bomborami, noted:

&quot;...Due to the increased blockade, the Circassians began to purchase this product (meaning gunpowder) from Karachay, or as they are called by the Circassian Knights, Karshaga-Kushkha (Black Tatars), whose mountains abundantly give sulfur and sanitrate: their gunpowder is beautiful and strong, but because of the difficulty of its transportation through the snowy mountains, Circassian warriors prefer, except in cases of urgent need for immediate delivery, to buy it from the Turks in exchange for their own products&quot;

Also, British agent James Bell, being with the Shapsugs, on the territory of present-day Sochi in 1837, writes:

&quot;Every man (I could say every child) had a gun: the best, as I was told, are delivered from an area called Karachay, in the upper Kuban&quot;

Note: only one Shapsugs exceeded the Karachay people at that time by almost 100 times, but they told two British agents where they get guns and gunpowder, so it was important.

The position chosen by the Karachay people is very well described by Apollo Shpakovsky:

&quot;The head of the right flank, Major General Evdokimov, in November 1851, undertook an enhanced reclamation to the upper reaches of the rivers: Big and Small Tegeney... Priteginsky auls ... were in friendly relations with the Karachays, a strong, predatory and militant tribe, only by the name &quot;peaceful and submissive&quot;. Karachay, surrounded by an almost impregnable chain of mountains, was an extremely important strategic point for the highlanders, and the Tegin auls served him from the Kuban, Zelenchuks and Laba as advanced strong outposts against our sudden invasions. Through them, the Karachays always learned about the misfortune that threatened them in time and deftly knew how to remove the well-deserved punishment, protecting themselves with the guise of a &quot;peaceful and submissive people&quot; and blaming all their frauds on non-peaceful Pritegins.

In 1855, the Karachays mostly supported Imam of Circassia Muhammad Amin, and joined his army, although there were those who were against him: &quot;At the beginning of 1851... the Temirgoys refused to recognize the power of the naiba... in the spring of 1851, the power of Muhammad-Amin was overthrown by the Black Sea Shapsugs... In the summer of the same year, Natuhai residents and residents of the Big Shapsug opposed the naib. In addition, in June 1851, a crowded people&#x27;s assembly was held at the Shapsugs and Natuhais, at which the issue of trust in Muhammad-Amin was resolved... most of the gathered dissociated themselves from him. Soon the Naib was forced to leave the Shapsugs and Natukhais and move to the Abadzekhs on the Psekups River... representatives of the Bzhedukh nobility actively acted against the Naib. And in the summer of 1851, the Khamysheev and Chercheneev princes and nobles appealed to the commander of the Russian troops on the Caucasus line and in the Black Sea N. S. Zavodovsky with an expression of submission to the Russian government and expressed a desire to take an oath of allegiance to Russia. However, the peasants did not support the feudal lords... the harsh actions of the military command led to the opposite result. The local population increased its resistance to the royal troops. And the positions of Mohammed-Amin, on the contrary, began to consolidate... Meanwhile, in May 1852, Naib gathered large military forces in the Maikop and Kurgip gorges. The rebels were preparing to make a campaign to Karachay. However, Muhammad-Amin, having learned that the military command was well prepared to repel the military expedition of the highlanders, abandoned his intentions to move with a campaign to Karachay... Western Karachai to lead the rebels from there in the event of the outbreak of hostilities. To this end, Muhammad-Amin, gathering on the river. White a large number of horse and footmen, in mid-July 1853 moved to Karachay. Soon, having learned about this, the Russian troops passed to the rr. Marukha and Aksaut in the upper reaches of Maly Zelenchuk to &quot;show the Karachai people their readiness to destroy the naib assassination assination&quot;

Karachay princes Krymshamkhalovs against the rebels &quot;put up 500 well-armed Karachay people with two companies of Kuban huntsmen to guard all important and convenient points for passage.&quot;

But when the naib settled down for the night in the upper reaches of Bolshoy Zelenchuk, his supporters from Karachay came to him and warned about the readiness of Russian troops and Karachay detachments to give a decisive rebuff to the rebels, after that &quot;panic began in the camp, and Mohammed-Amin went back.&quot;

The naiba of Muhammad-Amin was invited to Karachay by Mufti Mohammed Khubiyev, who shared the ideas of the rebels... Thus, Muhammad-Amin&#x27;s campaign in Karachay in 1853 did not take place... In the summer of 1855 Muhammad-Amin made an attempt to assert his power in Karachay. At the invitation of the Karachays, Naib entered their territory at the head of the Adyghe detachments... In August 1855, an active movement to join the Caucasian War began in Karachay, led by the spiritual leader of the Karachay people, Kadiy Magomet-Efendi Khubiev and Prince Idris Karabashev. Up to 3,000 Karachays joined this movement (in opinion of others, the figure is several times higher). On August 25, in the area of Hasauka, there was a battle between the united armed detachments of Karachays, Balkars, outer Kuban Adyghes, Nogais, Abazin and tsarist troops under the command of the General Kozlovsky. Russian troops won, Naib Muhammad-Amin went to outer Kuban, and an indemnit of 20 thousand rubles in silver was imposed on Karachay... However, despite the defeat, even after August 1855, the movement of Karachays did not stop. Prince M. S. testified to the formal nature of the Karachays withdrawal from the Caucasian War. Vorontsov, who in his letter of September 15, 1855, Gen. G. R. Eristov noted that &quot;the Karachay people call to themselves to Mohammed Amin ... I write in this letter the names of those Karachay residents who, as they say, called for the enemy: Mohammed Crimea Shavkalov, Aslan Murza Dudov, Shamakha Dudov, Badra Crimea Shavkalov, Adil Karabashev and Kuba Efendi&quot;

Theophilus Lapinsky, who lived and fought among the Circassians from 1857 to 1859, had weight and connections with the leaders of the resistance, also of the same opinion: &quot;Now we will consider the attitude of residents to the Russian government. Upon closer acquaintance, we should divide the peoples of the Caucasus into four groups on this relationship.

First, the population paying tax and obeying Russian laws. It consists of settlers and colonists - linear and Black Sea Cossacks, Tatars, Turks, and Armenians. This part of the population, not counting the regular army, represents a number of approximately 1,200,000 souls of both sexes.

Secondly, the peoples who recognize the supreme power of the Tsar and supply the militia to serve Russia, but pay little or no taxes, obey their own laws, have not laid down their weapons and only tolerate Russian domination. These are Georgians and most of the Armenians, Tajiks (Persians), Kabardians, Kurds, some small tribes. Their total number is approximately 2,200,000.

Thirdly, peoples, either only nominally recognizing the sovereignty of the tsar, or only having concluded a kind of truce with the Russians, do not pay taxes and do not supply the police; their raids should be held back by force. These are the southern Abazas, Svanets, Ossetians, small tribes of Samurzakans, Besleneys, Karachays and Elbrus Tatars, Eastern Caucasians, and Imam Shamil&#x27;s associates - Kumyks, Chechens, Avars, and Lezgins. Their number can be counted as 1,200,000 souls.

Fourthly, peoples in a state of war, against which the Russian Army is currently operating with all its might and about which the reader will find in this work as accurate a possible description. These are the northern Abazas (Adyge), which are incorrectly called Circassians in Europe and Turkey. Their number can be approximately 900,000 people.&quot;

After the Caucasian war and the Circassian Genocide about 10,000–15,756 Karachays and Balkars emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, with their migration reaching peaks in 1884–1887, 1893, and 1905–1906.

==Deportation==
In 1944, the Soviet government forcibly deported almost the entire Balkar population to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Omsk Oblast in Siberia. Starting on 8 March 1944 and finishing the following day, the NKVD loaded 37,713 Balkars onto 14 train echelons bound for Central Asia and Siberia. The Stalin regime placed the exiled Balkars under special settlement restrictions identical to those that it had imposed upon the deported Russian-Germans, Kalmyks, Karachais, Chechens and Ingush. By October 1946, the Balkar population had been reduced to 32,817 due to deaths from malnutrition and disease. The Balkars remained confined by the special settlement restrictions until 28 April 1956. Only in 1957, however, could they return to their mountainous homeland in the Caucasus. During 1957 and 1958, 34,749 Balkars returned home.

==Language and literacy==
In the Cyrillic alphabet as used by the Balkars, there are eight vowels and twenty-seven consonants. In the past the official written languages were Arabic for religious services and Turkish for business matters. From 1920 on Balkar has been the language of instruction in primary schools; subsequent instruction is carried out in Russian. Until 1928 Arabic letters were used to write the Balkar language; after 1937 Cyrillic was used. Ninety-six percent of the population is bilingual in Balkar and Russian. Organs of mass culture, secondary school texts, newspapers, and magazines in both Balkar and Russian continue to increase in number. In 2015, the number of bilingual people had increased by 1.3 percent resulting in 97.3 percent of the population speaking both Balkar and Russian. This is due to the globalization of urban areas and the impact of Russian education, in which children are more likely to be taught.

An example of a Balkar author is Kaisyn Kuliev who emphasized his love towards the Balkarya land and traditions.

<doc id="483598" wikidata="Q3745959" url="?curid=483598" title="Fireball Zone">
<text>Fireball Zone is the third solo album by the American musician Ric Ocasek, frontman and songwriter of the Cars. The first single from the 1991 release was &quot;Rockaway&quot;.

==Production==
The album was produced by Nile Rodgers and Ric Ocasek. Its title is a reference to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. &quot;Over and Over&quot; and &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; are ballads. In contrast to his Cars days, Ocasek recorded the album live, with his band, rather than part by part.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote that &quot;the main thrust of &quot;Fireball Zone&quot; is to emphasize a funk element within what has always been Ocasek&#x27;s music style—cold, lean, electronic pop with a tortured bottom end.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; opined that &quot;Fireball Zone&quot; &quot;may not be a masterpiece, but it&#x27;s better than any album by the repetitive Cars, easily one of the most overrated bands of the &#x27;80s.&quot; The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; determined that the album finds Ocasek&#x27;s &quot;rubber-band voice crawling over indistinguishable over-synthesized tunes set to a maddeningly tedious beat.&quot;

<doc id="483599" wikidata="Q1060353" url="?curid=483599" title="Buddy (Bill Clinton's dog)">
<text>Buddy (August 7, 1997 – January 2, 2002), a male chocolate-colored Labrador Retriever, was one of two pets kept by the Clinton family while Bill Clinton was President of the United States. The Clintons&#x27; other pet was a cat named Socks.

==Life==
Clinton acquired Buddy as a three-month-old puppy from Caroline County, Maryland, in December 1997. He named him after his late great-uncle, Henry Oren &quot;Buddy&quot; Grisham, who had died the previous June and whom Clinton often cited as a major influence on his life.
Socks did not get along with the frisky Buddy, so the White House had to keep the two in separate quarters. Since this arrangement would be no longer possible in the Clintons&#x27; smaller home in New York, Socks was left under the care of Bill Clinton&#x27;s secretary, Betty Currie.

==Death==
According to a police report, Buddy was killed by a car while &quot;playfully chasing a contractor&quot; who had left the Clinton home in Chappaqua, New York, on January 2, 2002. The Clintons were not home at the time of the accident; their home was being watched by Secret Service agents. The agents rushed Buddy to an animal hospital where he was pronounced dead.

In June 2002, Clinton acquired another chocolate Labrador whom he named &quot;Seamus&quot;.

==Cultural references==
First Lady Hillary Clinton wrote a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids&#x27; Letters to the First Pets&quot; in 1998. It included excerpts from more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children and more than 80 photographs of Socks and Buddy.

Buddy was a central character in Rick Cleveland&#x27;s 2005 one-man show &quot;My Buddy Bill&quot;, relating the writer&#x27;s fictional friendship with Bill Clinton, which began when both men discovered their common interest in dogs.

<doc id="483602" wikidata="Q3078079" url="?curid=483602" title="Fort Severn First Nation">
<text>Fort Severn First Nation () is a Western Swampy Cree First Nation band government located on the Severn River near Hudson Bay. It is the northernmost community in Ontario, Canada. In 2001, the population was 401, consisting of 90 families in an area of 40 square kilometres. The legal name of the reserve is Fort Severn 89, with the main settlement of Fort Severn (; ).

The town is linked by a winter/ice road called the Wapusk Trail during the winter to Peawanuck, Ontario, in the east, and Shamattawa and Gillam, Manitoba, to the west.

Fort Severn is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Indigenous-based service.

== History ==
This area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European contact, the historic Swampy Cree, an Algonquian-speaking people, lived in the area.

In 1689 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built Fort Severn at this site, originally naming it Fort James; it was one of the earliest English fur trading posts in the New World. After years of international competition between the English and French, with their wars playing out in North America, the French attacked the outpost and pillaged it in 1782 when they were allies of the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolutionary War.

In the early 20th century, when the federal government negotiated a treaty with the First Nations, it set aside land for a native reserve in the Rocksand area at the confluence of the Severn and Sachigo Rivers, with the consent of the leaders at the time. In 1973, the reserve was relocated to the mouth of the Severn River on Hudson Bay, for more direct access to shipping. The reserve achieved full status on January 11, 1980.

==Government==

The local band council consists of an elected chief, a deputy chief, and four band councillors.

==Community services==

There is no hospital in Fort Severn, with medical needs provided either at the local nursing station or via Keewaytinook Okimakanak Telemedicine (KOTM) link. The Community Doctor (Christopher Arthur Giles) travels in every month to do regular check-ups, follow-ups, and schedule appointments and surgeries. Specialists such as optometrists, dentists, and hygienists travel to Fort Severn every two to three months.

==Transportation==

There are only local roads in town and residents travel by car, snowmobile, four-wheelers, or walking.

The Fort Severn Airport is located a short distance from the settlement and is reached by an access road.

==Education==

Wasaho Cree Nation School is the full functioning school providing primary education needs. It was built in 2016, preparing students for 21st century learning. Keewaytinook Internet High School is housed in a small building and provides distance learning for residents needing secondary education.

==Climate==
Fort Severn has a subarctic climate (Dfc) and is one of the coldest communities in Ontario. Summers typically have cool to mild weather with short heatwaves, while winters are severely cold and long, lasting from October to sometimes through May.

==In popular culture==
Fort James, a British settlement controlled by a governor who reports to the king and who represents Hudson Bay Company, is the principal setting of the 2016 television series, &quot;Frontier&quot;. As Ann Foster describes for ScreenerTV, &quot;&#x27;Frontier&#x27; is set in the coastal settlement of Fort James: A snowy, treacherous pocket of land that would, in a century’s time, become part of Canada.&quot;

A town by the name of Fort Severn is featured in several episodes of the 1996 anime series &quot;After War Gundam X&quot;.

Johnny Cash mentions Fort Severn in the last line of the song &quot;Girl in Saskatoon&quot; (alternate version), written by Cash and Johnny Horton while they travelled through Canada in 1960.

<text>SriLankan Airlines is the flag carrier of Sri Lanka and a member airline of the Oneworld airline alliance. It was launched in 1979 as Air Lanka following the termination of operations of the original Sri Lankan flag carrier Air Ceylon. As of April 2024, it is Sri Lanka&#x27;s main airline by number of aircraft and destinations. Its hub is Bandaranaike International Airport.

Following its partial acquisition in 1998 by Emirates, it was re-branded and the current livery was introduced. In 2008, the government of Sri Lanka acquired all the shares of the airline from Emirates. After ending the Emirates partnership, it retained its re-branded name and logo. SriLankan Airlines operates over 560 flights per week across Asia.

SriLankan Airlines joined Oneworld airline alliance on 1 May 2014.

==History==
===Air Lanka===

In 1979, after the removal of airline manager Nimesh Fernando, Sri Lanka&#x27;s president Jayawardene initially did not interfere after entrusting the airline to Captain Rakitha Wickramanayake and the board of directors consisting of industry officials and managers. The former Prime Minister of Singapore asked, &quot;How could an airline pilot run an airline?&quot; A 1986 Presidential Commission reported on the mismanagement of the Board of the airline. Under President Wijetunga&#x27;s appointment of a retired General as Chairman/MD with Air Vice Marshals and a UNP attorney as executive directors. None of them knew how to run an airline.

Air Lanka was established as the flag carrier of Sri Lanka once the government shut down the bankrupt Air Ceylon. Air Lanka&#x27;s initial fleet consisted of two Boeing 707, leased from Singapore Airlines. One Boeing 737 was leased from Maersk Air and maintained by Air Tara. On 24 April 1980, the lease ended; Air Lanka received a replacement Boeing 737 leased from Royal Brunei. On 1 November 1980, Air Lanka commenced wide-body operations which were leased Lockheed L1011-1 Tristar from Air Canada.

On 15 April 1982, Air Lanka purchased an L1011 Tristar from All Nippon Airways. Another L1011 was leased from Air Canada whilst a third was purchased from All Nippon. With the introduction of Tristar aircraft, the Boeing 707 were phased out. On 1 May 1982, HAECO took over the maintenance of the two Air Lanka-owned Tristars, while Air Canada maintained two leased Tristars.

On 28 March 1980, Air Lanka signed a purchase agreement for two brand new Lockheed L1011-500 Tristars, the most advanced wide-body aircraft in the world at that time. The first Lockheed L1011-500 (4R-ULA) was accepted on 26 August 1982, at Palmdale, California. It was flown to Amsterdam as UL flight 566P. On 28 August, 4R-ULA &quot;City of Colombo&quot; left for its inaugural flight from Amsterdam to Colombo as UL566. It reached Colombo on 29 August. This was followed by the second Lockheed L1011-500, 4R-ULB, &quot;City of Jayawardanapura&quot;. On 8 June 1984 the airline received its first Boeing 747-200B &quot;King Vijaya&quot; and the second joined later. The aircraft were used on flights to Europe and a few flights to southeast Asia. However they were retired in 1987. In 1994, Air Lanka became the Asian Launch Customer of the Airbus A340-300.

===Rebranding===
Air Lanka, which was state-owned, was partially privatized in 1998, with investment by Dubai-based Emirates Group, when Emirates and the Sri Lankan government signed an agreement for a ten-year strategic partnership. This agreement included exclusive rights for all aircraft ground handling and airline catering at Colombo-Bandaranaike airport for ten years. Emirates bought a 40% stake worth US$70 million (which it later increased to 43.6%) in Air Lanka and sought to refurbish the airline&#x27;s image and fleet. The government retained a majority stake in the airline but gave full control to Emirates for investment and management decisions. In 1998, Air Lanka re-branded to SriLankan Airlines.

SriLankan acquired 6 Airbus A330-200s to complement its fleet of Airbus A340-300 and A320-200 aircraft. The A330-200 aircraft joined the airline between October 1999 and July 2000. The company&#x27;s fourth A340-300 arrived at Colombo painted in the airline&#x27;s new corporate livery. SriLankan upgraded its existing A340 fleet into a two-class configuration (business and economy class) whilst overhauling the interior to reflect the new corporate image.

The airline gradually increased its number of destinations with more additions for regional markets, notably India and the Middle East. Whilst continuing expansion in the region, SriLankan commenced flying to Jeddah, its third destination in Saudi Arabia, after Riyadh and Dammam, thus increasing the number of destinations in the Middle East to nine. Jeddah became the airline&#x27;s 51st destination overall.

In 2008, Emirates notified the Sri Lankan Government that it would not renew its management contract, which then expired on 31 March 2008. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Government was seeking greater control over the day-to-day management of the airline. Emirates sold its 43.63% stake in the airline back to the Government of Sri Lanka in a deal that was finalized in 2010, thus ending their partnership.

===Modern era===
In 2008 when Emirates pulled out, the accumulated profit of SriLankan was Rs. 9.288 billion in that financial year. From 2008 to 2015, when the government ran it, the loss for the seven years was Rs. 128.238 billion (US$875 million).

Following the ownership transfer, SriLankan began promoting Colombo as a hub for flights to Asia. The first destination of the expansion plan was Shanghai; the route was initiated on 1 July 2010. The airline commenced flights to Guangzhou on 28 January 2011.

SriLankan joined the Oneworld alliance on 1 May 2014. During 2014 it started to renew and increase its fleet, with purchases of Airbus A330 and A350 models. Currently, SriLankan operates an all-Airbus fleet except for its discontinued Air-Taxi services. SriLankan retired their last Airbus A340-300 on 7 January 2016 with its last scheduled flight from Chennai to Colombo.

The airline terminated three European routes – Frankfurt, Paris and Rome – by the end of 2016. On 2020, the Frankfurt and Paris routes were resumed.

The airline absorbed the operations of sister carrier Mihin Lanka in October 2016, in a bid to create a single stronger national airline for Sri Lanka. Accordingly, SriLankan took over two of Mihin Lanka&#x27;s aircraft and absorbed its route network, adding ten new destinations to SriLankan&#x27;s route network.

In October 2017, SriLankan launched direct daily non-stop flights to Melbourne, Australia, its first new long-haul route in over five years and the most ambitious expansion to date. The flights restore a regular direct air link between Australia and Sri Lanka after a hiatus of sixteen years. This route has proved particularly popular and has been responsible with increased numbers of Australian tourists holidaying in Sri Lanka.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, SriLankan performed cargo and operating relief flights. On 1 February 2020 it operated a relief flight out of Wuhan, China.

SriLankan lost 36.3 billion rupees up to August 2020 and the government approved a voluntary retirement package for 560 employees at a cost of 1.46 billion rupees.

From May 2022, due to the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka which resulted in the country facing a fuel shortage, SriLankan&#x27;s long-haul flights had to make stopovers at Trivandrum, Chennai and Kochi in India to refuel.

For the financial year 2022–2023, SriLankan Airlines achieved a break-even for the first time in over a decade and posted a net profit of $3 million.

SriLankan Airlines won the 2024 IFSA Best Inflight Food or Beverage Innovation Award at the APEX (Airline Passenger Experience Association) and IFSA (International Flight Services Association) Global Expo October 2023.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Business trends ===
The key trends of Sri Lankan Airlines (mainline) are as at the financial year ending 31 March:
=== Headquarters ===
The company&#x27;s head office is at Airline Centre, Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake.

===Livery===
The initial livery consisted of red stripes on a white fuselage. The tail was solid red and sported the corporate logo, a stylised vimana locally known as &quot;Dandu Monara&quot; (Flying Peacock Aircraft) of King Ravana of ancient &quot;Lanka&quot;, Ravana, as per the famous &quot;Ramayana&quot; mythology. The five &quot;tail feathers&quot; represent the &quot;Five Precepts&quot; (Pancha Seela) of Buddhism and the three &quot;crown feathers&quot; represent the &quot;Triple Gem&quot; (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) of Buddhism. Red reflects the predominant colour in the Sri Lankan national flag, which represents the majority race in the country, the Sinhalese. This was the sole livery of the airline for nearly two decades, from January 1979 to October 1998.

After Air Lanka began a decade-long partnership with Emirates, the name was changed to SriLankan Airlines; the livery was changed into a much simpler one, with an all-white fuselage, covered by blue &#x27;SriLankan&#x27; titles, and the tail adorned with the new corporate logo.

In May 2014, an Airbus A330 and an Airbus A320 in special oneworld livery was delivered to commemorate the airline&#x27;s establishment as a oneworld member. Newly delivered aircraft are adorned with a redesigned livery accompanying a blue underbelly slogan promoting Sri Lanka as a tourist destination.

===Subsidiaries===
SriLankan Catering is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SriLankan Airlines, providing flight catering services to all airlines serving the Bandaranaike International Airport.

Its other businesses include provision of aircraft maintenance and overhaul services, ground handling services, packaged holiday products, aviation training and IT services.

SriLankan currently operates to 14 destinations in India, more than any other foreign airline. It is also the largest foreign airline in the Maldives, serving two cities.

===Alliance===
On 11 June 2012, SriLankan Airlines was announced as Oneworld&#x27;s latest member-elect, on the sidelines of the IATA World Air Transport Summit in Beijing. Cathay Pacific served as SriLankan Airlines&#x27; sponsor through its alliance implementation program. Membership implementation lasted approximately 18 months.

===Fleet development===
The airline received its first Airbus aircraft in 1992; the Airbus A320-200 began flying to destinations in the Maldives, Pakistan, and southern India. The Airbus A340-300 was delivered in 1994. The airline was the first in Asia to use the A340. The Airbus A330-200 aircraft were delivered later.

In 2012, SriLankan Airlines aimed to boost its fleet to 35 aircraft over the next five years and had talks with both Airbus and Boeing regarding a deal. SriLankan&#x27;s former CEO Kapila Chandrasena stated that the carrier wanted to add either Airbus A330-300, Boeing 787-8 or Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to its fleet to replace its Airbus A340-300s, with deliveries beginning in 2013–2014.

In April 2013, it was announced that SriLankan Airlines had won government approval to acquire four Airbus A350-900 and seven A330-300 aircraft, with deliveries of the A330-300 starting from October 2014. Deliveries for the ordered A350-900s are set to commence in 2019. A further three Airbus A350-900s were leased, with deliveries of these aircraft starting in 2017.

SriLankan retired its last Airbus A340-300 on 7 January 2016, replaced by the A330-300 and the future A350-900. As of January 2016, construction of the airline&#x27;s first Airbus A350-900 started. On 23 February 2015, SriLankan Airlines finalized a deal with Air Lease Corporation and AerCap to acquire two Airbus A321neo aircraft, one from each leasing firm.

On 10 May 2016, due to financial difficulties, the airline announced it would cancel its order of eight A350 aircraft. As of December 2019, the four aircraft of Airbus A350-900 remained in the Airbus monthly order book and had yet to be cancelled or converted to A330-900 orders.

In April 2021 SriLankan announced its plans to retire 6-7 aircraft from its fleet. To replace the retiring aircraft, SriLankan have planned A350 and A330neo aircraft. After government approvals, SriLankan requested proposals for a six-year dry lease for five narrow-body aircraft and wet lease wide-body aircraft in late 2023. As per the RFPs, SriLankan received one A320 aircraft on 21 December 2023.

=== Aircraft naming ===
The airline names some of its aircraft after historically significant towns and cities in Sri Lanka, with aircraft named after Anuradapura, Yalpanam, Yapahuwa, Sri Jayawardenapura, and others.

===Historic fleet===
SriLankan also formerly operated the following aircraft:

==Services==
===Cabin===

SriLankan offers two classes of service, Business Class and Economy Class. In Business Class, SriLankan offers full flat-bed seats on all of its long haul fleet with Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) facilities. The fully flat bed seat offers a 19.5 inches wide seat that can be reclined into a 180-degree 79 inches long bed. Each seat has a 15-inch personal IFE system. SriLankan&#x27;s newest fleet additions will feature Thales Avant IFE, which features modern entertainment features and extended business class seats. Its A330-300 fleet presents an all-aisle access seating in a 1-2-1 arrangement on Business Class. On its A320 and A321 fleet, Business class is configured in a 2-2 layout, offering extra reclining seats, each seat with a width of 19 inches and a pitch between 39 and 49 inches.

SriLankan provides in-seat entertainment in Economy class on all its wide-bodied aircraft and the vast majority of narrow-body aircraft. On its A330-300 and A320/A321neo aircraft, all cabin classes are provided with the option of paid-for in-flight internet access and mobile telephony services.

===Entertainment===
SriLankan Airlines offer AVOD inflight entertainment on its aircraft. The A320, A321 &amp; A330-200 equipped with the RAVE ZODAIC Inflight Entertainment. The new A330-300 have the latest Thales AVANT Inflight Programme. SriLankan offers onboard WiFi connectivity with new Airbus A330-300 and A320/A321neo fleets in partnership with OnAir. SriLankan is South Asia&#x27;s first airline to have on-board WiFi capability.

===Catering===
SriLankan Catering Limited is the sole airline caterer in Sri Lanka. Its hub is at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA). SriLankan Catering&#x27;s main line of business is in-flight catering to airlines that operate to Bandaranaike International Airport. Its state-of-the-art flight kitchen at BIA has a capacity of 25,000 meals per day. Incorporated in 1979, as Air Lanka Catering Services Limited with BOI status, SriLankan Catering commenced business as a joint venture with Thai Airways International. In 1998 when the joint venture agreement with Thai Airways International lapsed Air Lanka Limited bought the shares of the joint venture partner and thus Air Lanka Catering Services became the fully owned subsidiary of SriLankan Airlines Limited. Thereafter the Company changed its name to SriLankan Catering (Private) Limited in September 2000.

===Frequent flyer programme===
SriLankan&#x27;s first frequent-flyer programme was called &quot;Serendib Miles&quot; and was abandoned in early 2000. It then became a partner of Emirates&#x27; Skywards frequent-flyer program. However, this agreement ceased to exist when the partnership between the two airlines concluded on 31 March 2008. SriLankan subsequently launched &quot;FlySmiLes&quot;, which has since added a variety of new reward partners to its program.
New membership tiers were added after the airline&#x27;s enrollment to the oneworld alliance to accommodate Oneworld membership tiers, gaining better privileges for members when aboard all Oneworld airlines.

There are a total of four membership tiers . They are:

*FlySmiLes Blue: Base tier
*FlySmiLes Classic: Oneworld Ruby
*FlySmiLes Gold: Oneworld Sapphire
*FlySmiLes Platinum: Oneworld Emerald

FlySmiles partners include all Oneworld airlines, Cinnamon Air and Etihad Airways and non-airlines partners like Abans and Spa Ceylon.

==Accidents and incidents==
Five of the six aircraft that have been destroyed, and all of the reported deaths of SriLankan Airlines passengers and employees, have been a result of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka.

===1980s===

On 3 May 1986, a bomb planted by the terrorist group LTTE exploded on board Flight UL512 before takeoff at Bandaranaike International Airport. The bomb, which had been timed to explode in-flight, went off while the Lockheed L-1011 &#x27;Tristar&#x27; aircraft was on the ground, killing 21 of 128 passengers. Officials believe the bomb may have been concealed in crates of meat and vegetables that were being freighted to the Maldives. Other reports believe that the bomb was hidden in the aircraft&#x27;s &#x27;Fly Away Kit&#x27;.

===1990s===
In 1992, the right landing gear of an Air Lanka Boeing 737-200 (registration 4R-ULL) at Madras airport (now Chennai International Airport) failed upon landing and the right engine came into contact with the runway. The aircraft pulled to the right and finally came to a stop, with the nose wheel and right wing on the grass to the right of the landing runway. The right engine caught fire – extinguished by the airport safety services – and the 104 passengers and 12 crew evacuated the aircraft via the chutes on the left side without injury. The damage to the aircraft was substantial; the plane was subsequently repaired and sold. The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation concluded that &quot;the accident occurred as a result of a failure of the right-hand main landing gear beam during the landing due to pre-existing stress corrosion cracks and pits at its inboard lug hole and higher than normal landing loads contributed to its failure&quot;.

===2000s===

On 24 July 2001, a pre-dawn LTTE raid on the Sri Lanka Air Force hangar along Bandaranaike International Airport left at least 19 people dead, including all 14 LTTE cadres, two army commandos and three air force personnel. Two of SriLankan Airlines&#x27; Airbus A330 planes (4R-ALE and 4R-ALF), one A320 (4R-ABA) and one of their A340 planes (4R-ADD) were destroyed. Two other aircraft were damaged (A340 4R-ADC and A320 4R-ABB). A number of military aircraft were also damaged and destroyed.

== Financial fallout ==
SriLankan Airlines has not made a profit since 2008; the year it was re-nationalised. In 1998, Emirates won a proposal to handle the nation&#x27;s flag airline, Air Lanka. Following that, Emirates rebranded the aging carrier as SriLankan and modernized its fleet with contemporary Airbus A330 aircraft. Emirates obtained ten years of management rights as part of the equity purchase. It later sold its ownership in the carrier for US$53 million, resulting in a nearly US$20 million loss.

Sri Lanka currently has no bankruptcy protection act, and the only option for a closedown would be a complete liquidation. If the Government liquidates the airline, it will be compelled to write off this debt to the state banks and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. This could raise significant concerns about the two-state banks&#x27; liquidity by foreign rating agencies and could seriously jeopardise the prospects of Sri Lanka&#x27;s entire banking sector. The Government as the guarantor would also be called upon for immediate repayment of the international bond worth US$175 million.

Should that occur, aircraft rent payments would no longer be made, the risk premium for airlines leasing aircraft in Sri Lanka would increase, making the country an unappealing base for a carrier. However, this would be good news for Airbus, which currently faces a more than US$1 billion claim for the airline over the A330 and A350 transactions for 2013.

In 2016 and 2017, SriLankan&#x27;s losses were impacted by costs related to the cancellation of its Airbus A350 lease agreements. If the majority of the fleet were all due for heavy maintenance in later years, this could imply a significant charge of LKR 3 billion per annum for the prior years if restated. Such a change would make a further dent in the profits recorded during the Emirates era, as the maintenance cost was legitimately understated.

SriLankan subsidiary Mihin Lanka never recorded an annual profit since its inception in 2007 and had an accumulated loss of LKR17.27 billion in 2016. For the 6-month period there was a loss of LKR 181 million and the remainder of the financial year it was budgeted to lose a further LKR billion. A few months after Mihin Lanka shut down, losses exceed LKR 13 billion. Most of the company&#x27;s assets were acquired by SriLankan Airline on 29 October 2016.

In 2020, SriLankan Airlines lost a little over US$200 million. In this period airline debt obligations today exceeded US$900 million (LKR 372 billion). The bulk of these appear to be debts to state banks and the CPC, both wholly owned by the Government of Sri Lanka. The airline also has at least one, sovereign guaranteed, internationally issued bond worth US$175 million.

According to the Finance Ministry data, SriLankan lost LKR 24.5 billion from April to July 2021, as the company, which was already losing money, encountered further difficulties during the SARS-CoV 2 outbreak. In the fiscal year ending March 2021, SriLankan lost LKR 58 billion.

== Controversies ==
In March 2015, a report was released following a Board of Inquiry investigation into corruption at SriLankan during the time it was under the chairmanship of Nishantha Wickramasinghe. The Board has reported that corruption was widespread and confirmed the allegations of Nishantha Wickramasinghe&#x27;s affairs. However, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Information Centre denied the allegations and accused the report of being biased and invalid, accusing the head of the committee of publicly supporting the current government in the elections and lacking technical knowledge about the aviation industry. It further claimed that he had been bribed to submit such a report as a publicity stunt to humiliate the previous government and that most of the points within it were untrue. The airline&#x27;s short-lived Air-Taxi service and its mismanagement was found to have caused the loss of millions of dollars to the airline.

In October 2015, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) attempted to summon Wickramasinghe to inquire about various irregularities in the airline; however, they were unable to locate him, and his wife claimed he had not come home for three years and that she was unaware of his whereabouts. Later he notified PRECIFAC that he was abroad and was unable to give a statement.

On 14 April 2021, SriLankan Airlines claimed on Twitter that it had made history by operating three successive cargo charter flights to Entebbe International Airport, Uganda, transporting over 102 tonnes of “printed papers” in February 2021. The nature of the “printed papers” was not immediately revealed. The tweet was later deleted, creating doubts about the transparency of SriLankan Airlines. The airline later issued a statement clarifying that the printed material was Ugandan currency which the Ugandan government preferred to obtain printed from a global security printer. The Biyagama branch of the De La Rue company is responsible for printing currency notes to countries including Uganda. SriLankan insisted that the consignment was purely commercial in nature and brought much needed foreign revenue to the airline.

SriLankan Airlines decided to sue Airbus for $1 billion as damages, loss of reputation, reimbursement of costs, and interests. The action follows the information revealed in the judgment of the Crown Court of the United Kingdom approving the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between the Serious Fraud Office and Airbus SE. The national carrier has also demanded Airbus for cancellation of the A350-900 Purchase Agreement for four A350-900 aircraft, returning the advance payment of $19 million made for those four A350-900 aircraft.

== Potential privatisation ==
Following the economic crisis of 2022, the Sri Lankan government has been exploring approaches to privatising several state-owned companies including SriLankan Airlines. In 2023, the Sri Lankan government set up the &#x27;State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit&#x27; (SRU) under the Ministry of Finance to assist in the privatisation of state-owned companies such as SriLankan Airlines.

An entity linked to AirAsia is among six entities accepted by Sri Lanka&#x27;s State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit (SRU) to bid for Sri Lankan Airlines. The government, which owns 99.52% of the airline, is selling a majority stake. The other entities include FitsAir, Dharshaan Elite Investment Holding Ltd., Sherisha Technologies Ltd., Hayleys PLC, and Treasure Republic Guardians Ltd.

AirAsia Consulting Sdn. Bhd., the consulting arm of AirAsia, is the only one with ties to a major airline. FitsAir is a Sri Lankan low-cost carrier, while Hayleys PLC is an established conglomerate.

The SRU will evaluate the RfQs based on specific guidelines, and participation doesn&#x27;t guarantee bidding rights. The government will take on LKR100 billion rupees (US$332.6 million) of Sri Lankan Airlines&#x27; debt, while a US$175 million international bond remains the airline&#x27;s responsibility. The government may also receive proceeds from an arbitration case against Airbus.

The NPP- led current government has abandoned plans for privatisation as of September 2024.

<doc id="483608" wikidata="Q211018" url="?curid=483608" title="Kumyks">
<text>Kumyks (, ) are a Turkic ethnic group living in Dagestan, Chechnya and North Ossetia. They are the largest Turkic people in the North Caucasus.

They traditionally populate the Kumyk Plateau (northern Dagestan and northeastern Chechnya), lands bordering the Caspian Sea, areas in North Ossetia, Chechnya and along the banks of the Terek River. They speak the Kumyk language, which until the 1930s had been the lingua franca of the Northern Caucasus.

Territories where Kumyks have traditionally lived, and where their historical state entities used to exist, are called Kumykia (). All of the lands populated by Kumyks were once part of the independent Tarki Shamkhalate.

==Population and present settlement area==
Kumyks comprise 14% of the population of the Republic of Dagestan, the third-largest population of Chechnya, and the fifth-largest population of North Ossetia, all of which are parts of the Russian Federation.

Kumyks are the second largest Turkic-speaking ethnic group after Azerbaijanis in the Causasus, the largest Turkic people of the North Caucasus and the third largest ethnic group of Dagestan.

According to the Russian national census of 2010 there were more than 500,000 Kumyks in Russia.

===Russian Federation===
In terms of administrative division in their native lands, Kumyks today are mostly divided between a few administrative regions of Russia, such as Republic of Dagestan, Republic of North-Ossetia, Chechen Republic.
===Turkey and the Middle East===
In the 19th century, during and following the Caucasian War, numbers of Kumyks were subject to or willingly resettled (made &quot;hijra&quot;) to the Ottoman Empire as a result of Russian deportation campaigns in the region.

In the 1910s–1920s, during the Russian Revolution, another emigration wave to Turkey took place. Among the &quot;muhajirs&quot; (migrants) of that period were many prominent Kumyk nobility.

Kumyks also used to move to Syria and Jordan, where a few Kumyk families still live. The Syrian village of Dar-Ful was established in 1878-1880 by Kumyk emigrants.

There is no official state census of ethnic minorities in Turkey (ethnic or racial censuses are outlawed), but according to the studies of 1994–1996, there were more than 20 settlements with Kumyk population.

==Ethnonym==
The majority of researchers (Bakikhanov, S. A. Tokarev, A. I. Tamay, S. Sh. Gadzhieva) derive the name &quot;Kumyk&quot; from a Turkic ethnonym &quot;Kimak&quot;, or from another name for Kipchaks — &quot;Cuman&quot;.

According to P. Uslar, in the 19th century the names &quot;Kumyk&quot; and &quot;Kumuk&quot; pertained to the Turkic speaking population of the Northern Caucasian lowlands. In Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia, the name Kumyk, or originally Kumuk pertained to the Kumyks only. Y. Fyodorov wrote, based on sources from the 8–19 cc., that &quot;Gumik — Kumyk — Kumuk&quot; is originally a Dagestani toponym from the Middle Ages.

In various Russian, European, Ottoman and Persian sources Kumyks were also called Dagestan Tatars (or Dagestan Turks), Circassian and Caucasus Tatars.

==Origin==
There is no universal opinion regarding the origin of the Kumyks. Some scholars propose that the population of the Kumyk plains of the 8th-10th centuries were directly ancestral to modern Kumyks. A view close to that is that the Kumyks appeared in Dagestan along with the Khazars in the 8th century and stayed afterwards. Whereas others believe that the Kumyks appeared in Dagestan in the 12th-13th centuries along with Kipchaks.

Kumyk verbal tradition carried through ages some proverbs and sayings coming from the times of the Khazar Kaghanate.

S. Tokarev wrote that:

A modern interpretation was proposed that &quot;from the Turkified Lezgins, Kumyks also emerged&quot;.

However, professor of Caucasus studies L. Lavrov doubted the &quot;Turkification&quot; hypothesis of Kumyk origin:

Another prominent Russian Orientalist, V. Minorsky, proposed his adjustment to the views mentioned, stating that:

The final stages of the Kumyk ethnogenesis stretched from the 12th-17th centuries.

Some of the Turkic peoples who assimilated into the Kumyk nation were those of Tumens from the Tumen Khanate (Caucasian Tumen), which emerged in the 15th century as a fragment of the dissolved Golden Horde; those of Bothe Bogans, Sople and pre-Cuman Turks, who populated the Botheragan-Madjar region in the 7th century, which encompassed the vast North Caucasian plains.

==History==
Kumyks historically were related to the states of the Caucasian Huns, Cuman-Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde.

The beginning of the Kumyk nation is often considered to be in the Khazar Kaganate era.

Until the 19th century, the Kumyks were a largely feudal, decentralized entity of strategical geographic and political importance for Russia, Persia and the Ottomans, headed by a leader called the Shamkhal (originally &quot;Shawkhal,&quot; in Russian sources &quot;Shevkal&quot;). The Kumyk polity known as the Shamkhalate of Tarki was mentioned as early as the 14th century by Timurid historians.

Other Kumyk states included the Endirey Principality, Utamish Sultanate, Tumen Possession, Braguny Principality, Mekhtuly Khanate, Kaytag Uzminate and others.

===Expansion of the Russian state, Ottoman Empire, and Persia===
In the 16th century, Kumyk rulers tried to balance their relationships with their three neighbouring states, and as a result the Shamkhalate established itself as a considerable regional power. The two empires and yet-to-be one Russian state considered the Caspian area as their influence domain.

Shamkhal Chopan became a subject of the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century, and participated in the 1578–1590 Ottoman-Persian War.

The 1560s marked the start of the numerous campaigns of the Imperial Russian Army against Kumyks, provoked by the requests of the Georgians and Kabardians. Commander Cheremisinov seized and plundered the capital of Tarki in 1560. The Tumen Khanate, allied with the Shamkhalate also resisted the invasion, but was conquered by Russia in 1588. The Russians established the Terki stronghold (Not to be mistaken for Tarki) in its former capital. Tumen ruler Soltaney fled to the protection of Sultan-Mahmud of Endirey, recognized today as a pan-Caucasian hero. In 1594, the other campaign of Khvorostinin in Dagestan was organised, during which Russian forces and Terek Cossacks seized Tarki again, but were blocked by the Kumyk forces and forced to retreat to Terki, which resulted in a stampede.

In 1604–1605, Ivan Buturlin conducted one more campaign against the Kyumks, often known as the Schevkal campaign. This also failed and resulted in a significant loss for Russia at the Battle of Karaman. The united forces of the Dagestani peoples under the banners of the Kumyk Shamkhalian, Prince Soltan-Mahmud of Endirey prevailed, and according to the prominent Russian historian Nikolay Karamzin, stopped Russian expansion for the next 118 years until the rule of Peter I.

In 1649 and 1650, Nogai leader Choban-murza sought the protection of their allies in the Shamkhalate. Russia, at war with the Nogais, sent 8,000 men in order to force the nomadic tribe to return to Russian territory. Surkhay-Shawkhal III attacked and routed Russian troops at the Battle of Germenchik. Kumyk military success continued from 1651 to 1653, when the Kumyks, this time in an alliance with Safavid forces, destroyed the Russian fortress at the Sunzha River. Shah Abbas II intended to strengthen the Persian hold on the Kumyk lands, which didn&#x27;t match with Surkhay&#x27;s plans. In an alliance with Kaytag Uzmi Rustem, Surkhay III confronted Persians but was forced to withdraw. Nevertheless, the high losses disrupted the Shah&#x27;s intentions of building fortresses in the Kumyk lands.

====Resistance to Peter I====
In the 18th century, Russian Emperor Peter I organised the Persian campaign of the 1722–1723. The Endirey principality was the first to oppose the Russian forces, and despite their defeat, caused great losses which shocked the Emperor. Kumyks of the Utamish Soltanate also fiercely resisted during the Battle at the River Inchge. Peter I stated afterwards:

The Tarki Shamkhalate initially took a pro-Russian stance, but after a new Russian fortress had been built they confronted Russia again. However, this time the Shamkhalate could not unite the neighboring local peoples and remained alone in their struggle. Russian historian Sergey Solovyov wrote:

===Caucasian War===
Russian 19th century general Gregory Phillipson, known for his important actions in subjugating the Adyghe and Abaza ethnic groups at the left flank of the Caucasian front in Circassia, wrote:

Kumyks were one of the major forces in the late 18th century Sheikh Mansur&#x27;s insurgence. Kumyk prince Chepalow, in alliance with Mansur made several attempts to attack the Russian stronghold of Kizlyar. In the final battle, Mansur led the Kumyk forces himself. Despite the formal acceptance of the Russian sovereignty over the Shamkhals at the beginning of the Caucasian war (resulting from the Treaty of Gulistan), there were numerous revolts in Kumykia. In 1825 the village of [Old] Aksay was destroyed and 300 men from the settlement were gathered for their participation in the insurgence against Russian Empire led by the Chechen leader Taymiyev Biybolat, and murdered when Ochar-Haji, one of the Kumyks, killed two Russian generals on the spot. In the same year the people of Endirey joined forces with mountain communities against the Russians.
In total, there were at least five revolts in Shamkhalate and on the Kumyk plateau (called also &quot;Kumyk plains&quot;): the Anti-Russian revolt, resulting in the defeat of Northern Kumyks (Endirey and Aksay principalities) and the then-disestablished Mekhtula Khanate, the Shamkhalate Revolt of 1823, participation in Beybulat Taymiyev&#x27;s revolt (who though recently had pledged allegiance to Russia), the Shamkhalate Revolt of 1831, the revolt at the Kumyk plains in 1831 and the Shamkhalate Revolt of 1843.

There were also preparations for an insurgency on the Kumyk plains in 1844 and for a general Kumyk insurgency in 1855, which had been planned as a joined action with the advance of Imam Shamil, but the advance didn&#x27;t progress enough into the Kumyk lands. In the insurgency in Dagestan in 1877–1878, one of the major centres of conflict was the Kumyk village of Bashly.

Despite the devastation brought by the Imperial Army for their attempts to rise against Russia, the Kumyk plains were also exposed to plundering forays from the neighboring tribes. For instance, in 1830, one Chechen leader, Avko, gathered forces in a call to allegedly join the troops of the leader of the Caucasian resistance, Gazi-Muhammad, but at the last moment declared the true reason &quot;to use the opportunity to attack the city of Endirey and plunder Kumyks&#x27; cattle&quot;. However, the troops disbanded in disappointment. Gazi-Muhammad himself tried to make Kumyks resettle higher in the mountains from the plains and join his resistance by destroying Kumyk settlements, as stated in the Russian military archives:

During the Caucasian War, Kumyks found themselves between a rock and a hard place, not always supported by the insurgents on one hand, and being a target of retaliation from Russians on the other. The same archives also described that:

Kumyks during the War gave the Caucasus many common heroes. Imam of Dagestan and Chechnya Shamil was of Kumyk descent, as well as his companion and the second pretender to the Imam&#x27;s position Tashaw-Hadji. Also, Kumyks were the leaders of the earlier Dagestani revolts, such as Soltan Ahmed-Khan of the Avars, and Umalat-bek of Boynak (the heir of the Tarki throne), companion of the imam Gazi-Muhammad Razibek of Kazanish, trusted companion of the Imam Shamil — Idris of Endirey.

==Genetics==
According to genetic studies in 2023, the following haplogroups are found to predominate among Kumyks :

* J1 (36%)
* R1b (19%)
* J2 (13%)
* G2 (11%)
* R1a (5%)
* C2 (4%)

==Colonization by Russia==
The tsarist and Soviet government pursued a policy of settling the Kumyk lands with other peoples from the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.

Back in 1811, Tormasov is known to order &quot;to incline the Chechens to retire from the mountains to the plane.&quot; Another governor of the Caucasus, Vorontsov, pursued the same policy of &quot;colonizing&quot; the possessions of the Kumyks, also by Chechens, arguing that &quot;the Kumyks have no right to those lands.&quot; Kumyk possessions also included such areas as Kachkalyk and Aukh, gradually settled by Chechens, and the region of Salatavia.

In the late 1870s, the entire southern part of the Khasavyurt district, from Gerzel-aul to Endirey, was populated by Chechens, sometimes by force, by the decree of Russia. From 1870 to 1877, the number of Chechens in the region increased from 5,912 Aukh to 14,000 Chechens and continued to rise to 18,128 in 1897. The possessions of the Kumyks in the Terek-Sunzha interfluve were lost, some of them along with the Kumyk population are now part of Chechnya.

In the 1850s, the Kumyk princes of the Kumyk district of the Terek region voluntarily gave up half of their lands in favor of the Kumyk people, however, documents confirming the relevant rights were issued only to the princes and uzdens, and the rights of the rest of the population were not documented. Local authorities, using various pretexts, moved newcomers to Kumyk lands. This policy of neglecting the right of the Kumyk population was recorded as continuing in 1907.

===Dissolution of Shamkhalate and the Kumyk Okrug===
When the Caucasian War ended on 30 December 1869, the Kumyk district of the Terek oblast (Northern Kumykia) was dissolved and renamed as Khasavyurt okrug.

According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, issued at the turn of the 19 - 20th centuries, there were 32,087 thousand Kumyks in Dagestan (which at that time did not comprised the Northern Kumykia). According to an 1891 survey, 108,800 Kumyks lived in the Dagestan and Terek Oblasts of the Russian Empire.

Somewhat earlier, in 1867 the Tarki Shamkhalate was abolished by the Russian authorities, which might be considered as the end of the Kumyk statehood.

===1916 revolt, Russian Revolution, Soviet and modern times===
In mid-July 1916 (late July 1916 ), Kumyk rebels rose up against Russian authorities in Aksay. The cause of the uprising laid in the Kumyk&#x27;s unwillingness to be conscripted into the Russian Imperial Army. The uprising ended on 24 July (6 August ), when the draft was cancelled.

During the establishment of the Soviet Union, Kumyk political elite were an active part in the creation of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. Haydar Bammate was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and one of the ideologists of the state, Prince Rashitkhan Kaplan was the Minister of Internal Affairs, one of the major military leaders was prince Nuh-bek Tarkovskiy, and Zubair Temirhanov was the speaker of the Alliance Council (&quot;Mejlis&quot; - Senate) of the Republic.

In 1926 the Soviet Population Census stated that there were 94 549 Kumyks in the Russian Empire, indicating demographic crisis, compared to the 1891 data.

===Demographics===
In 1795, the Russian Empire&#x27;s estimates give a number of 100 thousand people in the lands of Shamkhal (including other than Kumyks).

In 1833, rough estimations showed around 88 thousand Kumyks within the areas of influence of the Russian Empire. In 1866, after the end of the Caucasian War, some estimations showed around 78 thousand. In 1886, 1891 and 1897 accordingly — 88, 108, 83 thousand, in 1916 — 98 thousand.

The Soviet census of 1926 showed 88 thousand. Thus, there are no indications of any growth almost in a century, due to wars, emigration from Russian-conquered territories and disease.

Due to the continuous resettlement policies by the Russian Empire, then the Soviet government, and continuing today in the modern Republic of Dagestan of the Russian Federation, during the 19th through 21st century the native territories of Kumyks have been dramatically reduced; Kumyks became a minority in their own lands.

==Ethnocide by Soviet Union==

===Deportation===
By the decree of Stalin&#x27;s government, on the 12 of April 1944 the Kumyk population of historical Kumyk capital Tarki and adjacent villages were entirely deported to the Central Asian SSRs (Chechens, Karachays, Balkars and Crimean Tatars also were deported). The reason was stated as &quot;freeing the area for the agricultural needs&quot; of mountain peoples being resettled in the region. The deportation, despite the historical record in Russian law, is still not acknowledged by the Russian government. As a result of this event, the local population lost for years their ancient capital of Tarki, which led to the permanent destruction of most of the Kumyk cultural heritage.

===Reasoning for ethnocide===
As UNPO describes the membership of Kumyks as follows:

In 1925, Russian scholar Nikolay Trubetskoy expressed opinions, which may explain the given policy of Russia with regard to Kumyks:Kumyk is the &quot;international&quot; language of almost the entire North Caucasus (from the Caspian Sea to Kabarda inclusive), Azerbaijani dominates in most of the Transcaucasia (except the Black Sea coast) and, in addition, in Turkish Armenia, Kurdistan and Northern Persia. Both of these languages are Turkic. It must be held in mind that with the intensification of economic life, the use of &quot;international&quot; languages acquires such importance that it displaces native languages: many auls of the southern districts of Dagestan have already become completely &quot;Azerbaijanified&quot;. It is hardly in Russia&#x27;s interests to allow such a Turkification of Dagestan. After all, if the whole of Dagestan becomes Turkic, then there will be a continuous mass of Turks from Kazan to Anatolia and Northern Persia, which will create the most favorable conditions for the development of Pan-Turan ideas with a separatist, Russophobic bias. Dagestan should be used as a natural barrier to the Turkification of this part of Eurasia.Communist leader of Dagestan, who conducted the deportation of Kumyks, reasoned non-ethnical administrative bordering of Dagestan in this way:

&quot;Firstly, it [meaning splitting Dagestan by non-ethnic principle] was necessary to do this for economic reasons. If it were decided to grant national autonomy to at least the main peoples of Dagestan (Avars, Dargins, Kumyks, Lezgins, Laks, Tabasarans), then the main wealth of Dagestan (arable land, pastures) would go to the Kumyks, because they were located on their territory... Secondly, political and ethnic considerations were taken into account. So, the Avars in the entire history of their existence did not have a unified state entity...&quot;

==Language==
Kumyks speak the Kumyk language, which is a part of the Kipchak-Cuman subfamily of the Kipchak family of the Turkic languages. It is a direct descendant of the Khazar languages and in addition contains words from the Bulghar and Oghuz substratum.

Nikolay Baskakov, based on a famous 12th century scripture named Codex Cimanicus, included modern Kumyk, Karachai-Balkar, Crimean Tatar, Karaim, and the language of Mamluk Kipchaks in the Cuman-Kipchak languages. Alexander Samoylovich also considered Cuman-Kipchak close to Kumyk and Karachai-Balkar.

Kumyk had been a lingua-franca of a great part of the Northern Caucasus, from Dagestan to Kabarda, until the 1930s.

In 1848, a professor of the &quot;Caucasian Tatars&quot; (Kumyks) Timofey Makarov published a grammar of Kumyk, the first ever grammar written in Russian for a language spoken in the North Caucasus.

Kumyk was an official language of communication between the Northeastern Caucasian nations and the Russian administration.

Amongst the dialects of the Kumyk there are Kaitag, Terek (Güçük-yurt and Braguny), Buynaksk (Temir-Khan-Shura) and Xasavyurt. The latter two became basis for the literary language.

Kumyk is the oldest script literary language of Dagestan. During the 20th century, the writing system of the language was changed twice: during Soviet times in 1929 traditional Arabic script (called ajam) was substituted by the Latin script, and then in 1938 by Cyrillic script.

The closest languages to Kumyk are the Karachai-Balkar, Crimean Tatar, and Karaim languages.

More than 90% of Kumyks in Russia, according to the 2010 census, also speak Russian, and those in Turkey and the Levant (Sham) speak Turkish and Arabic.

==In Russian and European classical literature==
German poet Paul Fleming, travelling together with the Holstein embassy through Kumyk lands in 1633 and 1636, had dedicated to Kumykia and its towns a few verses.

The Kumyk language was a subject of studies for Russian classical authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Mikhail Lermontov, both of whom served with the Imperial Russian Army in the Caucasus. The language is present in such works of Tolstoy as &quot;The Raid&quot;, &quot;Cossacks&quot;, &quot;Hadji Murat&quot;, and Lermontov&#x27;s &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;.

Tolstoy described Kumyk village of Khamamatyurt in his &quot;Hunting in the Caucasus&quot;.

Alexander Bestuzhev also featured the Kumyk language and Kumykia in his works &quot;Molla-nur&quot; and &quot;Ammalat-bek&quot;, and described in some details Russian military raids on Kumyk settlements in his &quot;Letters from Dagestan&quot;.

Alexandre Dumas also described some areas of Kumykia and the time when he was a guest of a Kumyk prince Ali Qazanalp.

<text>John Griffin Carlisle (September 5, 1834July 31, 1910) was an American attorney and Democratic Party politician from Kentucky. He represented Kentucky in the United States House of Representatives from 1877 to 1890, serving as the 31st Speaker of the House from 1883 to 1889, and served in the United States Senate from 1890 to 1893. He served as the 41st Secretary of the Treasury, in the second administration of President Grover Cleveland, from 1893 to 1897—a period that included the Panic of 1893. As a Bourbon Democrat he was a leader of the conservative, pro-business wing of the party, along with Cleveland.

==Biography==

Carlisle was born in what is now Kenton County, Kentucky. He was well educated and took a post as a teacher in Covington, Kentucky. His father died in 1853 and he was left to support his family. He studied law under John W. Stevenson, and joined the law firm of William Kinkeard in Covington at the age of 23. Carlisle married Mary Jane Goodson on January 15, 1857, and they had five children, all of whom predeceased them.

Despite the political difficulties that taking a neutral position during the American Civil War caused him, Carlisle spent most of the 1860s in the Kentucky General Assembly, serving in the Kentucky House of Representatives and two terms in the Kentucky State Senate, and was elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1871, succeeding his former law mentor Stevenson.

===House of Representatives===
After Carlisle&#x27;s term as Lieutenant governor ended in 1875, he ran for and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives for Kentucky&#x27;s 6th district. On the main issues of the day, Carlisle was in favor of coining silver, but not for free coinage, and favored lower tariffs. He became a leader of the low-tariff wing of the Democratic Party, and was chosen by House Democrats to become Speaker in 1883 over Samuel J. Randall, a leader of the party&#x27;s protectionist wing.

As Speaker, Carlisle was both admired for and handicapped by his fairness and congeniality:

&quot;[H]e is the ablest man they have on that side of the House,&quot; said his Republican rival and successor Thomas Brackett Reed, &quot;[b]ut no Speaker could do any better with his hands tied by the rules we are working under.&quot;

Carlisle became a leader of the conservative Bourbon Democrats and was mentioned as a presidential candidate but the Democrats passed him over at their conventions for Winfield S. Hancock in 1880 and Grover Cleveland in 1884. Discomfort with nominating a southerner after the Civil War played a role in Carlisle&#x27;s failure to win either nomination. In 1892 Carlisle was again proposed as a candidate for president at the Democratic convention, but this time Carlisle asked that he not be considered. It was reported at the time that Carlisle dropped out with the understanding that Cleveland, once re-elected, would appoint him to his Cabinet.

===Senate and Treasury Department===
In May 1890, the Kentucky legislature elected Carlisle to the United States Senate to fill the nearly four years remaining in the unexpired term of the late Sen. James B. Beck. He served until February 1893, when he resigned to become Secretary of the Treasury under Cleveland, who had been elected president in November 1892.

Carlisle&#x27;s tenure as Secretary was marred by the Panic of 1893, a financial and economic disaster so severe that it ended Carlisle&#x27;s political career. In response to a run on the American gold supply, Carlisle felt forced to end silver coinage. He also felt compelled to oppose the 1894 Wilson–Gorman Tariff bill. These two stands were widely unpopular among agrarian Democrats. In 1896 Carlisle strenuously opposed Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, supporting a splinter Gold Democrat candidate, once-Illinois Governor Palmer, instead.

By 1896, the once remarkably popular Carlisle was so disliked due to his stewardship of the currency that he was forced to leave the stage in the middle of a speech in his home town of Covington due to a barrage of abuse. Feeling rejected, he retired from public life and sold his house in Covington.

===Later career and death===
By May 1899, the North American Trust Company had directors such as John G. Carlisle, Adlai E. Stevenson, and Wager Swayne.

He moved to New York City, where he practiced law, and died on July 31, 1910, at age 75, and is buried in Linden Grove Cemetery in Covington, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
Carlisle County, Kentucky was established in 1886.

<doc id="483620" wikidata="Q682597" url="?curid=483620" title="Kipchaks">
<text>The Kipchaks or Qipchaqs, also known as Kipchak Turks or Polovtsians, were Turkic nomads and then a confederation that existed in the Middle Ages inhabiting parts of the Eurasian Steppe.

First mentioned in the eighth century as part of the Second Turkic Khaganate, they most likely inhabited the Altai region from where they expanded over the following centuries, first as part of the Kimek–Kipchak confederation and later as part of a confederation with the Cumans. There were groups of Kipchaks in the Pontic–Caspian steppe, China, Syr Darya and Siberia. Cumania was conquered by the Mongol Empire in the early 13th century.

==Terminology==
The Kipchaks interpreted their name as meaning &quot;hollow tree&quot; (cf. Middle Turkic: &quot;kuv ağaç&quot;); according to them, inside a hollow tree, their original human ancestress gave birth to her son. Németh points to the Siberian &quot;qıpčaq&quot; &quot;angry, quick-tempered&quot; attested only in the Siberian Sağay dialect (a dialect of Khakas language). Klyashtorny links Kipchak to &quot;qovı&quot;, &quot;qovuq&quot; &quot;unfortunate, unlucky&quot;; yet Golden sees a better match in &quot;qıv&quot; &quot;good fortune&quot; and adjectival suffix &quot;-čāq&quot;. Regardless, Golden notes that the ethnonym&#x27;s original form and etymology &quot;remain a matter of contention and speculation&quot;.

==History==
On the Kipchak steppe, a complex ethnic assimilation and consolidation process took place between the 11th and 13th centuries. The western Kipchak tribes absorbed people of Oghuz, Pecheneg, ancient Bashkir, Bulgar and other origin; the eastern Kipchak merged with the Kimek, Karluk, Kara-Khitai and others. They were all identified by the ethnonym &quot;Kipchak&quot;. Groups and tribes of possible Mongolic or para-Mongolic extraction were also incorporated into the eastern Kipchak conglomerate. Peter Golden argues that the Ölberli were pushed westwards due to socio-political changes among the para-Mongolic Khitans, such as the collapse of the Liao dynasty and formation of the Qara Khitai, and attached themselves to the eastern Kipchak confederation where they eventually came to form a part of the ruling strata and elite. Golden identifies the Ölberli with the Qay whom are recorded as the &quot;Xi&quot; in Chinese sources and &quot;Tatabı&quot; in Turkic inscriptions, and were of Mongolic or para-Mongolic background - likely stemming from the Xianbei.

Chinese histories only mentioned the Kipchaks a few times: for example, Yuan general &#x27;s origin from Kipchak tribe Ölberli, or some information about the Kipchaks&#x27; homeland, horses, and the Kipchaks&#x27; physiognomy and psychology.
The Kipchaks were first unambiguously mentioned in Persian geographer ibn Khordadbeh&#x27;s Book of Roads and Kingdoms as a northernly Turkic tribe, after Toquz Oghuz, Karluks, Kimeks, Oghuz, &quot;J.f.r&quot; (either corrupted from &quot;Jikil&quot; or representing &quot;Majfar&quot; for &quot;Majğar&quot;), Pechenegs, Türgesh, Aðkiš, and before Yenisei Kirghiz. Kipchaks possibly appeared in the 8th-century Moyun Chur inscription as &quot;Türk-Qïbchaq&quot;, mentioned as having been part of the Turkic Khaganate for fifty years; even so, this attestation is uncertain as damages on the inscription leave only &quot;-čq&quot; (𐰲𐰴) (*&quot;-čaq&quot; or &quot;čiq&quot;) readable. It is unclear if the Kipchaks could be identified with, according to Klyashtorny, the [Al]tï Sir in the Orkhon inscriptions (薛延陀; pinyin: Xuè-Yántuó), or with the &quot;Juéyuèshī&quot; (厥越失) in Chinese sources; however, Zuev (2002) identified 厥越失 &quot;Juéyuèshī&quot; (&lt; MC *&quot;kiwat-jiwat-siet&quot;) with toponym Kürüshi in the Ezhim river valley (Ch. &quot;Ayan&quot; &lt; MCh. 阿豔 *&quot;a-iam&quot; &lt; OTrk. &quot;Ayam&quot;) in Tuva Depression. Linguist Bernard Karlgren and some Soviet scholars (e.g. Lev Gumilyov) attempted to connect the Kipchaks to the &quot;Qūshé ~ Qūshí&quot; (屈射), a people once conquered by the Xiongnu; however, Golden deems this connection unlikely, considering 屈射&#x27;s Old Chinese pronunciation *&quot;khut m-lak&quot; and Eastern Han Chinese *&quot;kʰut źa&quot; ~ &quot;kʰut jak/jɑk&quot; (as reconstructed by Schuessler, 2009:314,70). The relationship between the Kipchaks and Cumans is unclear.

While part of the Turkic Khaganate, they most likely inhabited the Altai region. When the Khaganate collapsed, they became part of the Kimek confederation, with which they expanded to the Irtysh, Ishim and Tobol rivers. They then appeared in Islamic sources. In the 9th century Ibn Khordadbeh indicated that they held autonomy within the Kimek confederation. They entered the Kimek in the 8th- or beginning of 9th century, and were one of seven original tribes. In the 10th-century &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; it is said that the Kimek appointed the Kipchak king. The Kimek confederation, probably spearheaded by the Kipchaks, moved into Oghuz lands, and Sighnaq in Syr Darya became the Kipchak urban centre. Kipchak remnants remained in Siberia, while others pushed westwards in the Qun migration. As a result, three Kipchak groups emerged:
* Kipchaks of the Pontic–Caspian steppe.
* Kipchaks of the Syr Darya, associated with the Khwarazmian dynasty.
* Kipchaks of Siberia, later composing the Siberian Tatars.

The early 11th century saw a massive Turkic nomadic migration towards the Islamic world. The first waves were recorded in the Kara-Khanid Khanate in 1017–18. It is unknown whether the Cumans conquered the Kipchaks or were simply the leaders of the confederacy of the Kipchak–Turkic tribes. What is certain is that the two peoples gradually mingled politically and that, from the second half of the 12th century onwards, the names Cumans and Kipchaks became interchangeable to refer to the whole confederacy.
The Mongols defeated the Alans after convincing the Kipchaks to desert them through pointing at their likeness in language and culture. Nonetheless, the Kipchaks were defeated next. Under &quot;khan&quot; Köten, Kipchaks fled to the Principality of Kiev (the Ruthenians), where the Kipchaks had several marriage relations, one of which was Köten&#x27;s son-in-law Mstislav Mstislavich of Galicia. The Ruthenians and Kipchaks forged an alliance against the Mongols, and met at the Dnieper to locate them. After an eight-day pursuit, they met at the Kalka River (1223). The Kipchaks, who were horse archers like the Mongols, served as the vanguard and scouts. The Mongols, who appeared to retreat, tricked the Ruthenian–Kipchak force into a trap after suddenly emerging behind the hills and surrounding them. The fleeing Kipchaks were closely pursued, and the Ruthenian camp was massacred.

The nomadic Kipchaks were the main targets of the Mongols when they crossed the Volga in 1236. The defeated Kipchaks mainly entered the Mongol ranks, while others fled westward. Köten led 40,000 families into Hungary, where King Bela IV granted them refuge in return for their Christianization. The refugee Kipchaks fled Hungary after Köten was murdered.

After their fall, Kipchaks and Cumans were known to have become mercenaries in Europe and taken as slave warriors. In Egypt, the Mamluks were in part drawn from Kipchaks and Cumans.

In 1239–1240, a large group of Kipchaks fleeing from the Mongols crossed the Danube. This group, which has an estimated population of over 10 thousand, wandered for a long time to find a suitable place to settle in Thrace. John III Doukas Vatatzes, who wanted to prevent a Kipchaks invasion of Byzantine lands and to benefit from their military capabilities, invited Kipchaks in Byzantine service. He settled some of them in Anatolia (what is now Turkey), to protect the Byzantine Empire from foreign invasions. When the Ottomans conquered the lands they lived in, these Kipchaks intermixed with the Turkmen and were assimilated among Turks. The Kipchaks who settled in Western Anatolia during the reign of Nicea Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes are the ancestors of a community called Manav living in Northwest Anatolia today.

Another Kipchak migration in Anatolia dates back to the period of the Chobanids Beylik, which ruled around Kastamonu (a city in Anatolia). Hüsameddin Emir Çoban, one of the Seljuk emirs, crossed the Black Sea and made an expedition to the Kipchak steppes and returned with countless booty and slaves. As a result of the expedition, a few Kipchak families in Crimea were brought to Sinop by sea via Sudak and settled in the Western Black Sea region. In addition, maritime trade intensified with the Crimea and Kipchak regions in the Isfendiyarids Beylik.

==Language==
The Kipchak–Cuman confederation spoke a Turkic language (Kipchak languages, Cuman language) whose most important surviving record is the &quot;Codex Cumanicus&quot;, a late 13th-century dictionary of words in Kipchak, Cuman, and Latin. The presence in Egypt of Turkic-speaking Mamluks also stimulated the compilation of Kipchak/Cuman-Arabic dictionaries and grammars that are important in the study of several old Turkic languages.

When members of the Armenian diaspora moved from the Crimean peninsula to the Polish-Ukrainian borderland, at the end of the 13th century, they brought Kipchak, their adopted Turkic language, with them. During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the Turkic language among the Armenian communities of the Kipchak people was Armeno-Kipchak. They were settled in the Lviv and Kamianets-Podilskyi areas of what is now Ukraine.

The literary form of the Cuman language became extinct in the 18th century in the region of Cumania in Hungary. Cuman in Crimea, however, became the ancestor of the central dialect of Crimean Tatar.

Mongolian linguistic elements in the Kipchak–Kimek confederation remain &quot;unproven&quot;; though that confederation&#x27;s constituent Tatar tribe possibly had been Mongolic speakers who later underwent Turkification.

==Religion==
The Kipchaks practiced Tengrism. Muslim conversion occurred near Islamic centres.
Some Kipchaks and Cumans were known to have converted to Christianity around the 11th century, at the suggestion of the Georgians, as they allied in their conflicts against the Muslims. A great number were baptized at the request of Georgian King David IV, who also married a daughter of Kipchak Khan Otrok. From 1120, there was a Kipchak national Christian church and an important clergy. Following the Mongol conquest, Islam rose in popularity among the Kipchaks of the Golden Horde.

==Confederations==
===Kimek===
The confederation or tribal union which Kipchaks entered in the 8th- or beginning of 9th century as one of seven original tribes is known in historiography as that of the Kimek (or Kimäk). Turkic inscriptions do not mention the state with that name. 10th-century Hudud al-&#x27;Alam mentions the &quot;country of Kīmāk&quot;, ruled by a &quot;khagan&quot; (king) who has eleven lieutenants that hold hereditary fiefs. Furthermore, &quot;Andar Az Khifchāq&quot; is mentioned as a country (&quot;nāḥiyat&quot;) of the &quot;Kīmāk&quot;, &#x27;of which inhabitants resemble the &quot;Ghūz&quot; in some customs&#x27;.

In the 9th century Ibn Khordadbeh indicated that they held autonomy within the Kimek confederation. They entered the Kimek in the 8th- or beginning of 9th century, and were one of the seven original tribes. In the 10th-century&#x27;s &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; it is said that the Kimek appointed the Kipchak king.

==Physical appearance==
The looks of a typical Kipchak are a matter of debate. This is because in spite of their Eastern origins, several sources point at them being white, blue-eyed, and blond. It is important to elaborate, however, that the full range of available data sketches a more complex picture. While the written sources often emphasize a fair complexion the craniometric and genetic data, as well as some historical descriptions, support the image of a people highly heterogenous in appearance. Skulls with East Asian features are often found in burials associated with the Kipchaks in Central Asia and Europe.

An early description of the physical appearance of Kipchaks comes from the Great Ming Code (大明律) Article 122, in which they were described as overall &#x27;vile&#x27; and having blonde/red hair and blue/green eyes. Han Chinese were not required to marry with Kipchaks. Fair complexion, e.g. red hair and blue or green eyes, were already noted by the Chinese for some other ancient Turkic tribes, such as the Yenisei Kirghiz, while the Tiele (to whom the Qun belonged) were not described as foreign looking, i.e. they were likely East Asian in appearance. It is noted that &quot;Chinese histories also depict the Turkic-speaking peoples as typically possessing East/Inner Asian physiognomy, as well as occasionally having West Eurasian physiognomy.&quot; Lee and Kuang believe it is likely &quot;early and medieval Turkic peoples themselves did not form a homogeneous entity and that some of them, non-Turkic by origin, had become Turkicised at some point in history.&quot; The Yenisei Kirghiz are among those suggested to be of turkicised or part non-Turkic origin. According to Lee &amp; Kuang, who cite Chinese historical descriptions as well as genetic data, the turcophone &quot;Qirghiz&quot; may have been of non-Turkic origin, and were later Turkified through inter-tribal marriage. Gardizi believed the red hair and white skin of the Kipchaks was explained by mixing with the &quot;Saqlabs&quot; (Slavs), while Lee &amp; Kuang note the non-Turkic components to be better explained by historical Iranian-speaking nomads.

== Genetics ==

Russian anthropologist Oshanin (1964: 24, 32) notes that the &#x27;Mongoloid&#x27; phenotype, characteristic of modern Kipchak-speaking Kazakhs and Qirghiz, prevails among the skulls of the historical Qipchaq and Pecheneg nomads found across Central Asia and Ukraine; Lee &amp; Kuang (2017) propose that Oshanin&#x27;s discovery is explainable by assuming that the historical Kipchaks&#x27; modern descendants are Kazakhs, whose men possess a high frequency of haplogroup C2&#x27;s subclade C2b1b1 (59.7 to 78%). Lee and Kuang also suggest that the high frequency (63.9%) of the Y-DNA haplogroup R-M73 among Karakypshaks (a tribe within the Kipchaks) allows inferrence about the genetics of Karakypshaks&#x27; medieval ancestors, thus explaining why some medieval Kipchaks were described as possessing &quot;blue [or green] eyes and red hair.

A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of two Kipchak males buried between c. 1000 AD and 1200 AD. One male was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup C2 and the maternal haplogroup F1b1b, and displayed &quot;increased East Asian ancestry&quot;. The other male was found to be a carrier of the maternal haplogroup D4 and displayed &quot;pronounced European ancestry&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Kipchak peoples and languages===

The modern Northwestern branch of the Turkic languages is often referred to as the Kipchak branch. The languages in this branch are mostly considered to be descendants of the Kipchak language, and the people who speak them may likewise be referred to as Kipchak peoples. Some of the groups traditionally included are the Manavs, Karachays, Balkars, Siberian Tatars, Nogays, Bashkirs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Volga Tatars, and Crimean Tatars. There is also a village named Kipchak in Crimea. Qypshaq, which is a development of &quot;Kipchak&quot; in the Kazakh language, is one of the constituent tribes of the Middle Horde confederation of the Kazakh people. The name Kipchak also occurs as a surname in Kazakhstan. Some of the descendants of the Kipchaks are the Bashkirian clan Qipsaq.

Radlov believed that among the current languages Cuman is closest to the Mishar dialect of the Tatar language. Especially the regional Mishar dialects of Sergachsky district have been named as &quot;faithfully close to original Kipchak&quot;.

<text>BENlabs, formerly BEN Group Inc., is a Los Angeles–based product placement, influencer marketing and licensing company. The company offers AI-driven product placement, influencer marketing services, music partnerships, rights clearance, and personality rights management services for the entertainment industry.

The company was founded in Seattle by Bill Gates in 1989 as Interactive Home Systems, and later renamed Corbis. The company&#x27;s original goal was to license and digitize artwork and other historic images for the prospective concept of digital frames. In 1997, Corbis changed its business model to focus on licensing the imagery and footage in its collection.

The Corbis collection included contemporary creative, editorial, entertainment, and historical photography as well as art and illustrations. Among its acquisitions were the 11 million piece Bettmann Archive, acquired in 1995; the Sygma collection in France (1999); and the German stock image company ZEFA (2005). Corbis also had the rights to digital reproduction for art from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the National Gallery in London.

Corbis later expanded into providing services for the entertainment industry, including brand integration and rights clearance services. In January 2016, Corbis announced that it had sold its image licensing businesses to Unity Glory International, an affiliate of Visual China Group. VCG licensed the images to Corbis&#x27;s historic rival, Getty Images, outside China. Corbis retained its entertainment businesses under the name Branded Entertainment Network, which has since evolved to BENlabs.

==Lines of business==

BEN Group&#x27;s Inc&#x27;s businesses include product placement services, the celebrity photo agency Splash News, as well as Greenlight, a business that provides clearances for images, music, video, and licenses personality rights for commercial use. BEN directly represents the personality rights of various figures, including Albert Einstein, Buzz Aldrin, Sophia Loren, Charlie Chaplin, Maria Callas, Andy Warhol, Martin Luther King Jr., Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali, Steve McQueen, and Thomas Edison among others. In 2015, BEN Group Inc acquired Plaid Social Labs, a leader in digital influencer marketing and integrations. In 2016, BEN Group Inc sold Splash.

==History==
===Founding===

Bill Gates founded the company in 1989 under the name Interactive Home Systems; he envisioned a system for allowing customers to decorate their homes with revolving displays of artwork, including works by notable painters, using digital frames and technology that had yet to have been developed. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Continuum Productions in 1992 and later, to Corbis Corporation. Interactive television was suggested as a way to deliver the content, but as the development of the planned product was under way, Corbis focused on digitizing content and acquiring rights to images. Corbis signed agreements with the National Gallery of London, the Library of Congress, the Sakamoto Archive, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.

In October 1995, the company purchased the Bettmann Archive collection, which included the pre-1983 photo library of United Press International and its predecessor photo agencies, Acme and INP, the photo arm of the International News Service. Prior to acquiring the Bettmann Archive, Corbis represented roughly 500,000 images, a total that increased substantially when the Bettmann drawings, artworks, news photographs, and other illustrations were added to the company&#x27;s portfolio. In all the Bettmann Archive contained 19 million images. The archive was stored 220 feet underground in a refrigerated cave in the Iron Mountain storage facility,

In 1995, the company won a contract with its first major photographer, Roger Ressmeyer, followed by several more, including Galen Rowell; this signalled growing interest in the world of professional photography, which up to that point had not taken the company seriously. In 1996 the company acquired the exclusive rights to approximately 40,000 images photographed by wilderness photographer Ansel Adams.

In 1997, Corbis named company veterans, Steve Davis and Tony Rojas, co-CEOs. Corbis also hired David Rheins to run Corbis&#x27; Productions, and Leslie Hughes to lead the company&#x27;s B2B image licensing division, Corbis Images. These hires marked the company&#x27;s shift to a more market focused entity. Corbis Productions published several award-winning CD-ROM titles such as &quot;A Passion for Art: Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Dr. Barnes&quot;, compiled from the Barnes Foundation collection, and &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;, which showcased the Codex Leicester.

In 1998, Leslie Hughes was named President of Corbis Images. The company expanded internationally and through product development and further acquisitions. The company acquired Digital Stock Corp., a supplier of royalty-free images to further expand its offering. In 1998, another division was added to Corbis Images when the company acquired Outline Press Syndicate, Inc., a supplier of celebrity portrait photography. Renamed Corbis Outline, the company syndicated studio portraits and candid photographs of actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, business leaders, scientists, and other celebrities and provided the images for sale to a broad range of national magazines. The same year, Corbis also acquired Westlight, adding over 3 million images to their archives while scanning best selling images.

In June 1999, the company acquired the French news photo agency Sygma, adding 40 million additional images to the company&#x27;s collection, and expanding Corbis&#x27;s portfolio beyond 65 million images. The archive is today stored in a preservation and access facility outside Paris.

In 2000, Microsoft (a fellow venture of Gates) purchased the rights through Corbis to the image &quot;Bucolic Green Hills&quot;, which it renamed to &quot;Bliss&quot; for the default wallpaper of Windows XP. The image was taken in the Los Carneros American Viticultural Area of Sonoma County, California, United States by photographer Charles O&#x27;Rear in 1996, who previously sent it to Westlight which Corbis had acquired in 1998.

===2000–2010===

Corbis&#x27;s business-to-business image licensing business expanded with the growth of the internet in the early part of the decade. The company also expanded geographically, making multiple acquisitions such as the Stock Market and expanding into the footage licensing market with the acquisition of Sekani.

*In 2000, after the company&#x27;s dramatic growth in the professional licensing business, Corbis named Leslie Hughes President of the newly consolidated Markets and Products Group (CMPG). The new group represented the consolidation of formerly separate business units, professional licensing and business communicator (small office).
*In 2001 Corbis built a state-of-the-art preservation facility in western Pennsylvania to house the Bettmann Archive. Corbis committed to preserving the collection for generations to come, and to allow continued access to this extraordinary collection.
*In late 2002, Leslie Hughes stepped down as President of Corbis&#x27; Markets and Products Group. Steve Davis was named as sole CEO, and Tony Rojas was appointed the company&#x27;s president.
*In 2005, the company expanded further into Europe with the acquisition of zefa, and into Australia in 2006, with the acquisition of Australian Picture Library.
*In April 2007, the company announced it was naming new leadership. Steve Davis stepped down as CEO, and Gary Shenk was named as the new CEO as of July 1. Shenk oversaw aggressive cost-cutting efforts to improve the company&#x27;s financial performance and address the rise of low-cost competitors. The company experienced several waves of layoffs for the next several years, shed non-profitable lines of business and reduced its number of offices globally.
*In November 2007, Corbis announced that it would be purchasing Veer and would continue to operate it as a separate brand.
*In early June 2007, Corbis announced that it was creating a microstock website, SnapVillage. The company said it intended to use its microstock site as a farm club to find photographers who could also sell their photographs on the main Corbis Web site. In late June, the company launched SnapVillage, with about 10,000 images initially viewable. SnapVillage was closed due to low sales in early 2009 and rolled into Veer.
*Corbis rebranded its Rights Services Division, previously a Division of Corbis Images, as &quot;GreenLight&quot; in 2008.
*In July 2008 Corbis sold eMotion LLC, its media management division, to Open Text Corporation.
*In May 2009, Corbis opened the Sygma Preservation and Access Facility outside Paris, France, housing tens of millions of photographic elements from the past half century in Europe. The company in 2009 also re-launched its Corbis Motion website with hundreds of thousands of new video clips, after signing a new partnership with Thought Equity Motion.
*In 2010, Corbis increased its focus on serving web and mobile customers, with the introduction of low-resolution file sizes images that were more affordable for Web and Mobile use. Corbis also relaunched its Veer.com website with a greater focus on affordable images and fonts to compete more effectively against low cost competitors.
* In 2010, Corbis was found to have committed fraud against Infoflows Corporation.
* In this decade, Corbis has discussed its financial direction in moving towards profitability multiple times without success.

===2011–2013===
* In January 2011, Shirley Jones sued Corbis alleging the company violated her publicity rights, and seeking class-action status for other celebrities. The case was thrown out in June 2011, with the court forcing Jones to pay Corbis&#x27;s legal fees and other costs.
* July 2011 – Five Photographers take Corbis to court for misuse of corporate assets in closing Corbis Sygma.
* July 2011 – Corbis acquires Splash News, a Los Angeles–based firm that deals in celebrity photography.
* August 2011 –Corbis and the Associated Press announce a distribution deal to try to reach each other&#x27;s customers for current and archival photographs. Corbis&#x27; collection includes the library of onetime AP-rival UPI, acquired in the purchase of Bettmann.
* January 2012 – Corbis acquires the product placement agency Norm Marshall Group.
* May 2012 – Washington State Appellate Court upholds jury verdict that Corbis committed fraud.
* Nov 2012 – Corbis expands global media footprint and acquires breaking news photojournalism newswire, Demotix, following successful investment and global distribution partnership.

=== Since 2016: Sale of image licensing business ===
On January 22, 2016, Corbis announced that it had sold its general image licensing business, including the Corbis Images, Corbis Motion and Veer libraries and their associated assets, to Unity Glory, an affiliate of Visual China Group. The sale did not include the Corbis Entertainment business, which would remain owned by the company under a new name. Concurrently, it was announced that VCG would exclusively license distribution of the Corbis images library outside China to its rival, Getty Images. VCG has historically served as the exclusive distributor of Getty content in China. Distribution of Corbis content was transitioned to Getty&#x27;s outlets, and the company manages Corbis&#x27;s physical archives on behalf of VCG. Of the deal, Getty CEO Jonathan Klein remarked that after 21 years in business, it was &quot;lovely to get the milk, the cream, cheese, yogurt and the meat without buying the cow.&quot;

In May 2016, following the handover of the Corbis images business to Unity Glory and Getty, Corbis Entertainment was renamed Branded Entertainment Network, and re-located its operations to Los Angeles. CEO Gary Shenk stated that the company had organized over 5,000 brand placements in 2015, with clients including Cadillac, Jose Cuervo, Microsoft, and others. In 2018, Ricky Ray Butler, was named CEO. In 2020 BEN won the Agency of the Year award at the 10th Streamy Awards.

In February 2023, BEN Group was rebranded as BENlabs.

<doc id="483626" wikidata="Q7427120" url="?curid=483626" title="Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran">
<text>Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran is a residential community built by Saudi Aramco for its employees to live in. It is located within the city of Dhahran (Arabic: الظهران) in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Eastern Province. There are three areas recognized by the inhabitants in the Dhahran camp. The first built is known as the &quot;Main Camp&quot;. It is the oldest part and the busiest as it contains the commissary, various shops and parks, and infrastructure. The second area, known as the &quot;Hills&quot;, is the quietest since it is mostly residential and more family-friendly. In 2017, a new residential area was opened and is known as &quot;Jebel Heights&quot;, an extension of the camp on the western edge of the facility. The area of Jebel Heights contains modern villas that vary from three-bedroom houses to five-bedroom houses as well as apartment blocks. 

The Dhahran residential camp is a private company compound, protected by armed guards, within which only Saudi Aramco employees and their dependents may reside. It is located near the grounds of the former US consulate as well as the Dhahran military airbase, which formerly housed the domestic and international air terminals for the Eastern Province. All commercial air passenger operations have since been moved to King Fahd International Airport in Dammam. 

The Dhahran camp (Aramco code: DH) is one of three original expatriate oil company compounds or &quot;districts&quot; in the east of the country, along with the camps in Ras Tanura (refinery and port), and Abqaiq (also Buqayq). Later, other Saudi Aramco compounds were built, such as Udhailiyah and Tanajib. More recently, the company established housing areas in various other Saudi cities including Jubail, Yanbu, Jeddah, and Rabigh among others - though not all of these are self-contained company compounds. The Dhahran camp was the first company compound, founded in the late 1930s, and is still the largest, with space to accommodate over 11,000 residents. Originally built to house Aramco&#x27;s American workforce and their families, Dhahran has in recent decades shifted from being predominantly inhabited by Americans to containing residents from a mixture of different nationalities, including a majority of Saudi nationals. 

==Geography==
The Dhahran residential camp is a short distance west of downtown Al Khobar, the closest Saudi town to Dhahran, and its traditional shopping center. The camp is about 15 km south of Dammam, both older Saudi port cities on the coast of the Arabian Gulf. Looking farther afield, Dhahran is northeast of Abqaiq, also a Saudi Aramco compound, and southeast of Qatif, and further north, Ras Tanura, Saudi Aramco&#x27;s main oil port. The island nation of Bahrain is also within easy driving distance to the east (about 32 km) across a causeway from Al Khobar.

==Economy==
The economy of the Dhahran Residential Camp is exclusively based on one company, Saudi Aramco, as everyone who lives in the compound is either employed by the company or the dependent of an employee. Dhahran has been Saudi Aramco&#x27;s HQ since 1952 when it moved from New York, and is the center of the company&#x27;s finance, exploration, engineering, drilling services, medical services, materials supply and other company organizations.

==Demographics==

Aramco has several self-contained communities to house its employees in the Eastern Province of which Dhahran is the largest with a total population of about 11,000. While in the past, inhabitants of Dhahran were mainly US employees of Saudi Aramco, this is no longer the case. Due to the ongoing Saudization of the workforce, along with a drive to recruit from less far afield, Western expatriates make up fewer than 5% of employees, both in the company as a whole and in the Dhahran residential community. 
 
The community today is made up of Saudis, other Arab nationalities (e.g. Lebanese, Egyptian and Jordanian), Asians, various South and North American nationalities and a few British expats. After several decades of Saudization, many Saudi families now live on the compound, although cultural rules within it are still more liberal (e.g. English is the common language, western clothing is normalized).

The community is also unusual demographically in that all residents of Dhahran are either employees of Saudi Aramco or their dependents; consequently, several age demographics are under-represented; 15- to 25-year-olds (Saudi Aramco provides no university for employees&#x27; dependents so many leave for schools elsewhere) and persons aged 60+ (retirees leave the company).

After 75+ years of community life, Dhahran, and the other three Saudi Aramco compounds have spawned several generations of &quot;Aramcons&quot;, most of whom have now returned to their country of origin rather than Saudi Arabia. Community ties remain strong years after employees have left however, and &quot;Aramco Reunions&quot; are held by ex-Aramcons in various locations in the U.S. every two years. Additionally, children of Saudi Aramco employees, sometimes referred to as &quot;Aramco brats&quot; have developed their own cultural identity and hold biannual reunions.

==Transportation==

As the centre of the nation&#x27;s oil industry, Dhahran has access to transport infrastructure linking it to Bahrain, Riyadh and Kuwait. 

The nation&#x27;s highway infrastructure was modernized in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s and connects the Dhahran area with a number of urban centres in the Kingdom, including its neighbors Kuwait, Qatar, and via a causeway, to the nearby island nation of Bahrain. The oil company built, but no longer maintains, the Tapline Road, which was finally closed in 1990. There are roads which link Dhahran with Saudi Aramco&#x27;s other major compounds Ras Tanura and Abqaiq and with its nearest traditional Saudi community Al Khobar.

The King Abdulaziz Air Base, a major Royal Saudi Air Force base, lies a short distance south of the compound. The area it occupies used to house one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s three major international airports, the Dhahran Airport (DHA). Dhahran airport originally consisted of three sections: the old King Fahd Air Terminal for regular passengers, separate facilities for Aramco corporate use (Aramco formerly had its own passenger airplanes offering international air service for employees until the early &#x27;60s), and the Dhahran Airfield, an airfield operated by the U.S. from 1946 until 1962. Today, King Fahd International Airport (DMM) serves the entire metropolitan area of Dhahran, Dammam, Khobar, Qatif and Al-Thuqbah. DHA also used to contain a section designated to Aramco Aviation Department, from which all company-run flights operated, but Aramco Aviation Department has since moved its services to its own buildings located near the King Fahd International Airport. The American air force still maintains a presence there.

Although rail service in Saudi Arabia plays a much more minor role today than 50 years ago, an industrial railroad with a station adjacent to Dhahran still exists, linking it to the capital Riyadh.

Within the company itself, Saudi Aramco runs free bus service for its employees, both within the compound, between the Dhahran Inter-District Bus Station and each of the three other Aramco districts, and shopping bus service into Khobar. Taxi service is also available within the compound. There are few, if any traffic jams in Dhahran even in rush hour (with the exception of the security gates and around the core area). This is in part because all traffic lights in Dhahran camp are computer-controlled to maximize the traffic flow.

Dhahran&#x27;s main office buildings, where most of the residents of the Dhahran camp work, include the Exploration and Petroleum Engineering Center (EXPEC) Building, the Engineering Building, the Tower Building, the Old Administration Building, and the New (Executive) Administration Building. The EXPEC, Engineering and Tower buildings are connected by a tunnel to help employees avoid exposure to the extremes of the Saudi climate. These offices are located within the Saudi Aramco camp, but outside the residential camp proper.

==Communications==
The Communications Department of Saudi Aramco administers land line communications in Dhahran. Local calls (i.e., calls within the Eastern Province) and calls to other Aramco Camps are free. Calls to cities outside the Eastern Province, to mobile phones and overseas calls are charged at the same rates as those set by the Saudi Telecom Company.

Fiber Optic Internet services in the camp cost from around $100 per month from either STC or Mobily.

==Education==
Within the compound itself, Saudi Aramco operates two schools, the Dhahran Hills School (Elementary, K-4) and the Dhahran School (5-9). The company has never provided a high school, which used to compel employees to send dependent students out of country after the 9th grade for secondary school and college. (A graduation ceremony is attached to this rite of passage, and graduating 9th grade Aramco students identify themselves thereafter as the &quot;Class of 2022&quot;, for example). To pursue high school education, most children of Saudi Aramco employees either enrol in foreign boardings or American School Dhahran, a nearby American-curriculum international school just outside Khobar.

Dhahran schools employ an American-based curriculum. The children of Saudi Aramco expatriate employees of whatever nationality are allowed to attend; however, the children of Saudi employees may not attend (with exception of K4 and kindergarten level), unless they have special permission from the Ministry of Education (very rarely given and only temporarily). Until 1980, Saudi employees living on camp were allowed to register their children in the company school, but thereafter the Saudi Ministry of Education regulations were enforced.

Beyond the compound, the greater Dhahran area is home to the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), a national technical institution built just outside the compound&#x27;s original perimeter fence, and the Dhahran Industrial Training Center (ITC), which includes the campus of the selective College Preparatory Center for promising Saudi secondary students preparing for study abroad.

==Media==
===Newspapers and magazines===
All papers published locally are either owned by Saudi Aramco or special community interest groups (SIGs), and they are all free. The main weekly is the &quot;Arabian Sun &quot;newspaper. Most Saudi Aramco-owned papers and magazines are available online at Aramco&#x27;s official website (anyone may request a hard-copy subscription free of charge). The papers that are owned by SIGs are available online only through Saudi Aramco&#x27;s internal network.

Like the publications listed above, the company&#x27;s highly regarded &quot;Aramco World&quot; magazine of Middle Eastern and Islamic cultural topics can be subscribed to worldwide for free.

===Television===
Aramco TV (Dhahran TV, and named Channel 3 later) was the first TV channel in the Arabian Gulf area and the second in the Middle East. Dhahran TV started broadcasting on September 17, 1957. Although originally in English, it later started to broadcast in Arabic, but at the same time, viewers could listen to the English version of the TV programs through Aramco radio simultaneously. By 1970, it had become a commercial free, all-English channel after Al Saudiya started broadcasting in 1966. Up until the first Gulf War, Channel 3 was the only English language television station readily available. It was sometimes the object of humour for its airing of dated programming, censored entertainment, and a bland nightly news broadcast. Programming included on-screen calligraphy that announced prayer times and shows that were dated. The channel could not show any kissing between men and women. Most Dhahran residents used their television set to watch VHS tapes or play video games. The main attraction of Channel 3 was that it aired well made documentaries concerning Middle Eastern history, culture, cuisine and environment.

The demise of Channel 3 was due to the fact that Dhahran residents started to get other choices for English language entertainment and news television. In the early 1990s the first Persian Gulf War gave Dhahran residents the ability to pick up the American Forces Network. By the late 1990s, satellite television services were becoming more affordable and offering a wider selection of commercial news and entertainment programming that was less censored and more contemporary. The result was that in 1998, Saudi Aramco discontinued the channel.

===Radio===
Saudi Aramco operates the radio stations &#x27;91.4 Energy Radio 1&#x27; and &#x27;101.4 Energy Radio 2&#x27;. 

91.4 Energy Radio 1, &#x27;Saudis Number 1 Hit Music Station&#x27; is a Top 40 pop music station with a line up including key shows &#x27;One Breakfast with Jacob&#x27; airing 6-10am each weekday and &#x27;The Homerun with Faz and Danny&#x27; airing 4-8pm each weekday. 

101.4 Energy Radio 2, &#x27;Music Beyond the Mainstream&#x27; is an alternative music station with a line up including key shows &#x27;Good Morning Saudi Arabia with Marie Claire&#x27; airing 6-10am each weekday and &#x27;House Blend with Comet&#x27; airing 4-8pm each weekday.

Both stations stream on the Energy Radio KSA app, as well as a mix of online music stations branded as &#x27;Energy Radio X&#x27;. All stations and shows are based in Dhahran and broadcast 24/7 with many listeners using the app to stream in other regions of KSA.

== Sport ==
The Dhahran community once had a very active social calendar undertaken through &#x27;Self-Directed groups&#x27; within the Saudi Aramco community. Since post Covid-19 many of the expats that supported these groups were let go by the company or retired. As a result very few remain and those that do are finding it hard to find volunteers to run their operations.

The groups that remain are organized through four main areas; Cultural Groups; Service Groups; Special Interest Groups and Sports Activities, with the latter being the most active. A number of the sporting groups have in previous years participated internationally, for example Saudi Aramco Youth Soccer Organization (SAYSO) travel teams regularly participated in tournaments in the Middle East and Europe (notably the Gothia Cup, Dana Cup and Norway Cup) and the running group competed in races all over the Middle East. The Little League Baseball team from Dhahran qualified for the Little League World Series in 1983, 1985, 1987–1989, 1991, 1994–1998, and 2000–2011.

<text>Zeal was a volunteer-built web directory launched by Brian Goler and Kevin Berk in 1999, and then acquired by LookSmart in October 2000 for $20 million. Zeal combined the work of Looksmart&#x27;s paid editors with that of volunteers who profiled websites and placed them in a hierarchy of subcategories. The resulting categories and profiles were downloaded at intervals by LookSmart and its partners, other search companies such as MSN, Lycos, and Altavista, for use in their own systems with or without modification.

Paid editors attended to commercial sites and oversaw the voluntary work on non-commercial sites.

Volunteers worked under a defined set of Guidelines and were required to pass an introductory level test on those Guidelines before submitting site profiles or edits. As points and experience were acquired, volunteers could elect to take a further exam which allowed them to &quot;adopt&quot; and create topic categories of special interest. They could then move up the organizational structure from Community Member to Zealot to Expert Zealot, acquiring additional tools and oversight responsibility at each level. Expert Zealots, who could move or delete some whole categories, monitored the day-to-day operations of the non-commercial portion of the directory and acted as mentors to new members.

Active volunteers were found in many English-speaking countries (particularly North America, United Kingdom, India, Australia, and New Zealand) and some other countries such as Spain, Switzerland, and Japan.

By March 2003, Zeal had passed the 250,000 listings mark; eventually it passed the 400,000 mark due, in part, to the Zeal Charity Drive contest of October 2003, which saw over $25,000 distributed around prominent charities such as the WWF. 

After Looksmart&#x27;s acquisition of Zeal, its internet traffic as measured by Alexa fluctuated considerably; after MSN withdrew from the related partnership, Zeal traffic declined from &quot;usually better than 2000th&quot; (mid-2003) to &quot;about 5000th&quot; (mid-2004).

Branch offices in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom were closed in about 2004, and the corresponding directories were said to have been sold but/and were gradually merged with the main directory.

The Zeal directory closed on March 28, 2006 and was sold in October 2007 for $50,000.

<doc id="483630" wikidata="Q1127393" url="?curid=483630" title="Horizontal top-bar hive">
<text>A top-bar hive is a single-story frameless beehive in which the comb hangs from removable bars. The bars form a continuous roof over the comb, whereas the frames in most current hives allow space for bees to move up or down between boxes. Hives that have frames or that use honey chambers in summer but which use management principles similar to those of regular top-bar hives are sometimes also referred to as top-bar hives. Top-bar hives are rectangular in shape and are typically more than twice as wide as multi-story framed hives commonly found in English-speaking countries. Top-bar hives usually include one box only, and allow for beekeeping methods that interfere very little with the colony. While conventional advice often recommends inspecting each colony each week during the warmer months, heavy work when full supers have to be lifted, some beekeepers fully inspect top-bar hives only once a year, and only one comb needs to be lifted at a time.

There is no single opinion leader or national standard for horizontal hives, and many different designs are used. Some will accept the various standard frame sizes.

==General information==
Although the two most well-known styles of long top-bar hives are named &quot;Kenyan&quot; and &quot;Tanzanian&quot;, the Kenyan hive was actually developed in Canada, and the so-called Tanzanian hive is not the same as the top-bar hive that was developed in Tanzania.

The design of top-bar hives has its origins in the work done in 1965 by Tredwell and Paterson. A tub shaped top-bar hive was trialled in Rhodesia in the 1960s by Penelope Papadopoulou. Long top-bar hives began to appear in the 1960s and were first referred to as &quot;grecian&quot; hives also known as the &quot;Anástomo&quot; wicker skep. Similar &quot;long&quot; top-bar hives were also developed in the early 1970s by other authors. The David Hive (1972) was similar to the Kenyan top-bar hive, except that the comb was not cut from the bars at harvest time but reused after extraction. Also in 1972, William Bielby designed a top-bar hive that featured catenary curved comb.

===Design===
Although guidebooks for use in Africa often give precise dimensions for the Kenyan hive, and encourage beekeepers to keep their equipment of uniform and thus interchangeable sizes, one of the main selling points of the KTBH among proponents from English speaking countries is the fact that it can be made to practically any size and shape, as long as the top bars have an appropriate width.

The angle of the sloped sides is most commonly recommended to be 30 degrees. The width of the top bars is the sum of comb thickness and one measure of beespace. This helps ensure that bees build exactly one comb per top bar. Most top-bar hive plans freely available on the internet show hives of roughly 1 meter (3&#x27;) long and between 30 cm (12&quot;) and 50 cm (20&quot;) wide and high.

In English speaking countries, the top-bar hive is usually mounted on a set of legs that lift the hive to a height that is comfortable for beekeepers. In African countries, the height of the hive is often also determined by the type of animal the hive is meant to be protected from.

====Top bars====

A top-bar hive has bars from which the honey bees attach and hang wax comb, an array of hexagonal (six sided) cells.

A beekeeper can make top bars from any plain wood. The top bars are usually wide, depending on local conditions and the type of bee to be housed. Combs can be handled individually. The depth of the bar and the length of the bar can be whatever the beekeeper wants, but usually between . If the top bar hive is deeper than , the weight of the comb filled with honey tends to cause it to fall off the bar into the bottom of the hive. The bees will lose access to this during the winter cluster in the hanging combs, thus increasing their likelihood of starving.

It is important to give the bees a clear starting point to build comb on each top bar. Some TBH beekeepers fashion their top bars with a V-shaped bottom to guide the comb building. Alternatively, some use a table saw to cut two closely spaced slots along the long axis of each new top bar. Either type of guide, wax line or grooves, gives bees a place to hold on to with their hooked feet. This allows a substantial &quot;drape&quot; of bees to form, which is the beginning of comb building.

====Entrance====

Top hives have entrances that are a small slot or a number of holes of an inch in diameter or thereabouts, which more closely mimics what honey bees prefer in nest cavities.

The brood nest will be established nearest the entrance. If the entrance is at the narrow end of the hive, the honey storage will be deep in the hive beyond the brood nest combs. Typically inspections will then begin with either the beginning of the brood nest at the front, or with the end of the honey storage at the rear. If the entrance is placed in the center of the long wall, the brood nest will be at the center, and the honey storage will be on either side. As it is not possible to safely remove a bar from the middle of the occupied combs, due to possible side attachments, this means the inspection can begin on either side of the honey storage and there are fewer before the brood nest is reached.

The entrance should not be placed high on the hive as this will allow the escape of winter heat (but see ) for an alternative perspective).

The bees will be able to keep a top bar hive cool enough with only three holes of diameter. They do so by both lining up to fan cool air into the hive and exhaust warm air, and by evaporation – essentially air-conditioning the hive. It is possible to have too small of an entrance, such as a slot of only , and this did result in combs falling from the bars in the heat. It also resulted in much traffic back up at the entrance.

It is suggested that bees in a Kenyan hive will have much less tendency to adhere comb to the sides of the hive. Once adhered comb is freed from the side (leaving a beespace) the bees tend to not rejoin the comb, so this is not a significant problem for either hive. It is important in either type that end access or some free space without comb is available so adhered comb may be freed.

===Comparisons with hive systems using vertical &quot;supers&quot; and conventional frames===

The initial costs and equipment requirements are typically much less than other hive designs. Scrap wood can often be used to build a good hive, and top bars are easy to make out of scrap timber. Horizontal hives do not require the beekeeper to lift super boxes; all usual checks and manipulation can be done while lifting only one comb at a time and with minimal bending. In areas where large land animals (such as ratels and bears) present a threat to beehives, single-box hives may be suspended out of reach. Elsewhere, they are commonly raised to a level that allows the beekeeper to inspect and manipulate them in comfort. Since no seasonal storage of honey collection boxes (&quot;supers&quot;) is needed, nor is a centrifugal extractor commonly used, the equipment budget and storage space requirements are greatly reduced. Time and money may not need to be spent wiring foundation into frames.

A top bar hive can also be rapidly converted to two or even three mini hives, called a nucleus hive, by placing bee-tight dividers within the hive, and allowing access to independent entrances. This may avoid the need to purchase and store such nucleus hives.

Disadvantages include (usually) unsupported combs that cannot be spun in most honey extractors. It is not usually possible to expand the hive if additional honey storage space is required. Most horizontal hives cannot easily be lifted and carried by one person.

===Hive management===
It is recommended that new or recycled empty bars be placed at each side of the brood chamber just before spring build-up as it is easier for the bees to make new comb than to move honey stores to make room for new brood. This will also ensure the maintenance of a well built honey barrier between the brood and higher grade stores. To prevent the buildup of old comb in the brood chamber it may be advantageous to add new bars only on the entrance side of the brood chamber just past the pollen stores. This will cause a collection of older honey in re-used comb, which may be removed and used to produce a somewhat lesser quality of honey, as it will have additional flavors from the propolis used to strengthen and protect the brood comb. Such honey may be especially appropriate for making mead and root beer, as additional flavors will predominate. The progressive removal of brood comb appears, as noted above, consistent with control of AFB. The use of follower boards to selectively control the amount of interior space available to the bees can be helpful, particularly in young hives or when dealing with newly captured swarms.

The recent introduction of sliding &#x27;follower boards&#x27; to enclose the colony within the hive body has enabled more flexible management of top bar hives and facilitated quicker inspections with minimal disturbance to the bees. (Follower boards are adjustable solid panels, which effectively reduce the size of the interior space within the hive box that is accessible to the bees.)

====Queen exclusion====
Natural queen exclusion occurs more frequently in top-bar hives, because the brood nest is separated from the honey section by at least a full bar of honey comb, and not just a few centimetres (inches) of honey as may be the case in a multi-storey framed hive. And the more honey is gathered, the further the brood nest becomes from newly created comb.

However, some commercial top-bar beekeepers have found that artificial queen excluders are sometimes necessary to keep the queen from laying eggs in the honey section of the hive.

====Hive inspection====
A top-bar hive is inspected by lifting the bars of comb individually. Some beekeepers start their inspection at any one of the bars, and can be completed over several sessions. Others start at either the front of the hive, against the wall or divider, or at the rear of the combs. This way the beekeeper can see and cut any side attachments before moving the first comb. Side attachments can be cut with a conventional hive tool; using a specially-made tool long enough to reach the bottom of the hive, but with a narrow &quot;leg&quot; at the bottom, is more efficient. More than one bar can be separated from the side walls at a time. The use of smoke is commonly recommended.

Inspection of the combs can be carried out with far less disturbance to the bees than is the case with multi-storey hives, since only a small amount of the hive is exposed at any one time. Some hives incorporate a viewing glass window in the side of the hive that allows for observation without opening the hive itself, since in theory the combs do not get attached to the sloping sides.

The top-bars rest freely on the hive walls without spacers, which means that the top-bars can be slid easily along the length of the hive during the inspection, without altering the sequence of the combs, and non-inspected bars need not be lifted out of the way to gain access to other bars.

As part of the &quot;natural beekeeping&quot; concept, some beekeepers recommend opening the brood area only once a year.

===Harvesting honey===
The most popular method of harvesting honey from a top-bar hive is by cutting the comb from the top-bar, crushing the comb and straining the honey. This results in honey with a higher pollen content than honey that is extracted by flinging out without crushing the comb. Top-bar hive comb can be extracted by flinging motion e.g. in a hobbyist or commercial rotary extractor, but it can be problematic, because (a) if no foundation was used, the comb will break more easily during rotary movement, (b) top-bar hives combs may use irregular or non-standard sizes that do not fit into commercially available extractors, (c) if the comb is not uniformly flat, it may be difficult to uncap the cells, which is required for rotary extraction and (d) not all rotary extractors have cages or mesh to prevent loose pieces of comb from falling into the drum.

Honey can also be harvested from top-bar comb as cut comb.

As crushing and straining is the most common method for honey harvesting in this type of hive, beeswax is often a by-product of top-bar hive beekeeping.

==Philosophy==
Top-bar hives are popular with some beekeepers who believe it is a more natural form of beekeeping. Their building does not usually require such precise measurements as modern multi-story hives.

==Tub shaped top-bar hive==
Although modern &quot;long&quot; top-bar hives originated in the middle of the twentieth century, initially for use in development projects, a &quot;tub shaped&quot; top-bar hive has been in use for centuries in some regions such as Greece. An example of the tub shaped top-bar hive is the so-called Greek hive that was first described in the 17th century and has been used in Crete until recently. Tub shaped top-bar hives are usually small enough to be portable, and allow beekeeping methods that involve periodic merging and splitting of colonies.

Bee hives that conform to the general description of top-bar hives have existed for many centuries. The earliest known possible mention of a bee hive with removable top-bars is in Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai&#x27;s didactic poem &quot;Le Api&quot;, written in 1539.

The travelling pair George Wheler and Jacques Spon witnessed a beekeeping method using woven tub shaped top-bar hives in Greece in 1676. Spon briefly mentioned this in his memoirs, but Wheler gave a detailed description and a drawing of such a hive in his work &quot;Journey Into Greece&quot;, published in 1682. The dimensions of that hive (including the supposed width of the top-bars and the angle of the hive sides) are variously indicated in modern citations of Wheler&#x27;s work, but that is pure fiction, since Wheler himself mentioned no dimensions in his book.

The beekeeper Zuanne Papadopoli described tub shaped top-bar beekeeping in clay pots that were used prior to 1669 in Crete. He wrote about it in his memoirs in 1696.

In 1790, Abbot Della Rocca from Syros also wrote about tub shaped top-bar bee hives used in Crete during his time.

Although there is evidence that beekeeping was commonly practiced in Crete since the Late Minoan I period (1600–1450 BC), the most common method of beekeeping in that region is using clay or woven long, cylindrical hives.

Thomas Wildman described tub shaped top-bar hives as &quot;skeps that are open at the top&quot; in his &quot;Treatise on the management of bees&quot; in 1768.

Greek &quot;Anástomo&quot; bee hives, wicker or made from clay, are round in shape and have top-bar frames. At Kythira Greece we find rectangular top bar hives made from stone which are considered the first top bar hives with fully interchangeable combs.

==Tanzanian top-bar hive==
Although the term &quot;Tanzanian&quot; top-bar hive is currently used in English-speaking countries to denote a Kenyan top-bar hive with straight sides instead of sloping sides, the original Tanzanian top-bar hive was developed independent of the Kenyan hive, and had design features that do not occur in modern so-called Tanzanian top-bar hives.

Until the 1960s, beekeepers in rural Tanzania used predominantly log hives, which consisted of a cylinder with closed ends and a harvesting hole near the middle. The fact that harvesting was done from the middle of the log meant that brood comb was destroyed every time honey was harvested. The Tanzanian government then promoted two alternative hive types, namely a log hive that could be harvested from either end (so that the brood nest in the centre remains undisturbed) and a plank hive, which was a simple top-bar hive. The plank hive did not use moveable top bars, however – bees would attach comb in natural patterns to the roof. The advantage of the plank hive was that it enabled some inspection before harvest.

The researcher G. Ntenga then designed a transitional hive, in 1972, based on the plank hive that uses moveable top-bars. This hive is sometimes called the Tanzanian Transitional Hive in literature, and was the original Tanzanian top-bar hive. Ntenga&#x27;s hive had very precise measurements. It used top-bars with either a centre groove, a V-shaped bevel, or flat surface. The top-bars had lugs that were narrower than the bar itself. The hive could take 28 combs. The hive was covered with two lids, each covering half the hive.

One variation of Ntenga&#x27;s hive used top-bars of instead of wide, that would each carry two combs instead of one.

==Kenyan top-bar hive – KTBH==
The hive commonly referred to as the Kenyan top-bar hive was developed by Dr. Maurice V. Smith and Dr. Gordon Townsend from the University of Guelph in Canada, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) under an initial four year overseas project which began in Kenya in 1971. The hive and its development was subsequently and extensively described by Dr. Isaac Kirea Kigatiira from Kenya, who was a student at Guelph in the early 1970s.

Although the hive&#x27;s management differs strongly from the tub shaped Greek hive, early publications about the Kenyan hive often mention the Greek hive as an inspiration for the Kenyan hive.

The original Kenyan hive was designed to hang from trees or poles. Other modern variations of this hive, such as the Jackson hive used in South Africa, are also intended as hanging hives. Hanging the hive some distance from the ground protects it from both wild and domestic animals, as well as from ants and beetles.

A version with straight sides was developed by Henry Mulzac by 1977, which used Langstroth compatible dimensions. The South African Jackson hive also uses Langstroth sized frames.

<text>Ignacije Szentmartony (October 28, 1718 – April 15, 1793) was a Croatian Jesuit priest, missionary, mathematician, astronomer, explorer and cartographer.

==Biography==

Szentmartony was born in Kottori, Kingdom of Hungary (today Kotoriba, Međimurje, Croatia), to a Croat mother and a Hungarian father. After graduating from secondary school he entered the order of Jesuits in Vienna in 1735. He studied in Vienna and Graz, (Austria) where he also lectured mathematics. By the year 1751, he was in Lisbon, Portugal where he obtained the title of royal mathematician and astronomer. With those credentials, he became a member of an expedition that worked on the rearrangement of the frontiers among Portuguese and Spanish colonies in South America.

In 1753, he sailed for Brazil into the very mouth of the Amazon River. Based on his surveys, Lorenz Kaulen made in 1753 a map of Maranhão district titled &quot;Mappa Viceprovinciae Societatis Iesu Maragnonii anno MDCCLIII concinnata&quot;. Its original is in &quot;Biblioteca de Évora&quot; in Portugal. Another map, &quot;Mapa da Ilha do Maranhão&quot;, made in 1757 again based upon Szentmartony&#x27;s surveys, is also kept here. Between 1754-56, Father Szentmartony took part in expeditions to the Amazon and the Rio Negro. Upon the data obtained from his systematical astronomical surveys, in 1755 engineers Schwebel and Sturm made a regional map titled &quot;Mappa Geographico dos Rios&quot;. It was a first-rate cartographic representation of the riverbed containing data relating to islets, tributaries and settlements.

He complained vigorously about the inhumane treatment of the native people by the colonizers, so his expedition came under scrutiny and failed. Szentmartony remained as a missionary in the settlement of Ibyrajuba near Pará. In 1760 he was deported with other persecuted Jesuits, put in prison and released in 1777 upon the intervention of the Empress Maria Theresa. He returned to Croatia in 1780. In 1773 his religious order was suppressed. A priest in Belica (Belicza), he died in Čakovec (Csáktornya) in 1793.

He is also believed to be the author of &quot;Einleitung zur kroatischen Sprachlehre für Teutschen&quot;, the first Kajkavian grammar, published in 1783 in Varaždin.

The township contains the communities of Bayview Park, Big Chute, Cedar Nook, Crooked Bay, Franceville, Go Home, Honey Harbour, Macey Bay, MacTier, Moon River, Potters Landing, South Bay, Wolverine Beach, and Wood Landing.

Honey Harbour serves as a launching point to the &quot;30,000 Islands&quot; that make up the Georgian Bay geography. The islands, that are accessible from Honey Harbour, are dotted with hundreds to thousands of cottages. The cottages serve mostly as summer residences. Many very large cottages have been built recently, which has resulted in an increase in property values. The economic cycle of Honey Harbour is tied to the cycle of the cottagers. Honey Harbour has a small grocery store (&quot;Towne Centre&quot; and Picnic Island Resort, which features its own general store and gas bar), a post office, a liquor store, a bakery, a Catholic church and school, a public elementary school, several small craft stores, a large resort (the &quot;Delawana Resort&quot;), and several marinas. In addition to cottages, there are multiple waterfront trailer park resorts. There are also numerous clean beaches lining both the shore and islands, inhabited by the diverse Ontario wildlife.

The double H of Honey Harbour is a play on founder&#x27;s name, Harvey Hewitt, of Pasadena, California. Hewitt was also the original pioneer and co-developer of Woolite.

<doc id="483642" wikidata="Q576486" url="?curid=483642" title="Candy-O">
<text>Candy-O is the second studio album by American new wave band the Cars, released on June 2, 1979, by Elektra Records.

Produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the album spawned two singles, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All I Can Do&quot;. The album outperformed the band&#x27;s debut, peaking at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The cover art was done by pin-up artist Alberto Vargas.

== Background ==
Unlike the first album, &quot;Candy-O&quot; was created under a more democratic approach. Ric Ocasek said of this, &quot;When one of my songs goes to the band in barest cassette form, we sit around and talk about it. If I&#x27;m outvoted, we don&#x27;t do it. We almost didn&#x27;t include &#x27;Double Life&#x27; on the new album, it had been dropped. I think everybody in the Cars is open-minded and creative enough that they would do anything – nobody&#x27;s holding anything back. Everybody appreciates the more radical, experimental kinds of music and likes it. But sometimes, when you&#x27;re put together with five pieces, things are not as minimal as they could or should be. Everybody&#x27;s developed a unique personal style, and we rely on their input. If they did it, it&#x27;s good enough.&quot;

Most of the songs on &quot;Candy-O&quot; were written after the release of &quot;The Cars&quot;, meaning that most of the leftovers from the first album (including the popular encore &quot;Take What You Want&quot;) were scrapped; &quot;Night Spots&quot;, a reject from the first album, was still included.

For the album, the band once again worked with Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker. Ocasek said of their relationship with the producer, &quot;Well, some of the things on that first album that we thought were a little slick, we toned down on the second, like on the background vocals. But if we were going to rely on the producer we had hired, there was no reason to try and change him. On the second album, it was easier to say, &#x27;Roy, let&#x27;s not do the multi-tracked harmonies this time.

The band&#x27;s label, Elektra, initially wanted to hold back the release of the album, but the band stood their ground. Ocasek said of this, &quot;At first Elektra wanted to hold it back some, but we told them there was no way, because if they were going to hold that back, they were going to hold us back, and we can&#x27;t just sit around and be held back.&quot; Released as the follow-up to their 1978 debut album &quot;The Cars&quot;, &quot;Candy-O&quot; peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. The album re-entered the charts at number 179 in 1984. The record was also ranked number 82 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s &quot;Top Albums of the Year&quot; chart for 1979.

Three singles were lifted from &quot;Candy-O&quot;: &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; reached number 14, making it the first top-20 Cars single, &quot;It&#x27;s All I Can Do&quot; peaked at number 41, barely missing the top 40, and &quot;Double Life&quot; failed to chart.

== Cover art ==
The album cover was painted by artist Alberto Vargas, who was known for his paintings of pin-up girls that appeared in &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazines in the 1940s through the 1960s. The idea to hire Vargas came from drummer David Robinson, the band&#x27;s artistic director and a collector of pin-ups. The 83-year-old Vargas had retired several years earlier but was persuaded to take the assignment by his niece, who was a fan of the Cars. The painting, depicting a woman sprawled across the hood of a Ferrari 365 GTC/4, was based on a photo shoot directed by Robinson at a Ferrari dealership. The model, coincidentally named Candy Moore, briefly dated Robinson afterward. 

=== Candy Moore ===
Candy Moore, a model and actress who appeared in the 1981 movie &quot;Lunch Wagon&quot;, is often confused with an actress of the same name who starred in &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and married actor Paul Gleason. The case of incorrect identity is pervasive throughout the Internet, having the &quot;Lucy Show&quot; actress often linked to, and credited with, the work of the model found on the Cars&#x27; album. The Candy Moore from the cover of the &quot;Candy-O&quot; album can also be found wearing a red shirt on the cover of Rick James&#x27; album &quot;Street Songs&quot;, and on subsequent sleeves for his singles such as &quot;Ghetto Life&quot;. Other shots of the model during the &quot;Candy-O&quot; cover shoot can be found in a video interview with David Robinson.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Candy-O&quot; was positively received by critics. Harry Sumrall of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the album as &quot;invigorating and enlightening&quot; and found that Ocasek&#x27;s songs possessed a &quot;certain adolescent charm&quot; while avoiding &quot;any direct allusions to &#x27;50s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau summarized the album as follows: &quot;Cold and thin, shiny and hypnotic, it&#x27;s what they do best—rock and roll that is definitely pop without a hint of cuteness&quot;. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Tom Carson was more reserved in his praise, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s almost inevitable that &quot;Candy-O&quot;, the Cars&#x27; second album, doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as exciting as their first. The element of surprise is gone, and the band hasn&#x27;t been able to come up with anything new to replace it. &quot;Candy-O&quot; is an elaborately constructed, lively, entertaining LP that&#x27;s packed with good things. And it&#x27;s got a wonderful title. But it&#x27;s a little too disciplined, a shade too predictable.&quot;

===Retrospective reception===

In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Greg Prato said that while &quot;Candy-O&quot; &quot;was not as stellar&quot; as &quot;The Cars&quot;, &quot;it did contain several classics, resulting in another smash album that solidified the band&#x27;s standing as one of the most promising new bands of the late &#x27;70s.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;Take &quot;Candy-O&quot;, which followed their debut by almost exactly a year. Superficially, the album offers another dose of stylish, detached pop with hooks so finely honed, they may have come off an assembly line. Listen closely, though, and &quot;Candy-O&quot; boasts bolder production that emphasizes the band’s heavy attack and gives plenty of space for guitarist Elliot Easton to spin out composed solos. It sounds not just like new wave—the umbrella term for any pop-oriented counterculture music that arose in the wake of punk—but album rock.&quot;

Hamish Champ, writer of &quot;The 100 Best-Selling Albums of the 70s&quot;, said: &quot;With UK producer Roy Thomas Baker once again behind the decks, Ric Ocasek and his colleagues produced a follow-up to their hugely successful debut with more of the same quirky, offbeat songs that had caused such a stir the first time around.&quot;

<text>Lake of Bays is a township municipality within the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. The township, situated north of Toronto, is named after the Lake of Bays. During the 2016 census, the township had a population of 3,167 and encompassed of land.

Located in the northeast corner of Muskoka, Lake of Bays offers a natural landscape of forests, rocks, lakes and wetlands. It is an important destination for cottaging, recreation and tourism in Ontario. Currently, the economy of the township is primarily based on tourism, recreation, and the service sector with forestry and aggregate (composite) extraction contributing as well.

== History ==

The Township of Lake of Bays was established in 1971 from the former Townships of Franklin, Ridout, McLean and Sinclair/Finlayson (unorganized) as one of six area municipalities within the District of Muskoka.

In the early 20th century, several grand resort hotels opened on the lake, among them the Wawa (built in 1908 and destroyed by fire in 1923) and the Bigwin Inn, a resort that operated on Bigwin Island from 1920 until the late 1960s. These hotels were sought after destinations for many rich and famous individuals and groups at the time, including Hollywood stars like Clark Gable, writers like Ernest Hemingway and, during the Second World War, the Dutch royal family.

The township was once home to the smallest commercial railway line in the world called the Portage Railway. Between 1904 and 1958 it ferried passengers between North Portage on Peninsula Lake to South Portage on Lake of Bays, a distance of 2 km. The train, named the &quot;Portage Flyer&quot;, was discontinued in 1958 and was relocated to an amusement park near St. Thomas, Ontario, until 1984. Much of the original components have since been repatriated and continue to operate on the grounds of Muskoka Heritage Place near Huntsville.

==Communities==
The township includes the communities of Baysville, Bigwin, Birkendale, Bona Vista, Bondi Village, Britannia, Brooks Mills, Browns Brae, Dorset, Dwight, Fox Point, Glenmount, Grandview, Grassmere, Grove Park, Hillside, Limberlost Lodge, Lumina, Maple Ridge, Millar Hill (ghost town), Nith Grove, North Portage, Norway Point, Port Cunnington, Sea Breeze, South Portage and Wahawin.

A small community developed on the subdivided landholdings of a sawmill built by William Brown in the 1870s. The economic development of Baysville was enabled by good road and steamboat connections. Baysville developed into a popular region for vacationers and sportsmen.

== Local bodies of water ==

==In film==

The 1949 FitzPatrick Traveltalk &quot;Ontario: Land of Lakes&quot; includes a segment on Bigwin Inn.

In 1963, the former Dorset Fire Tower was shown in the opening credits of the old CBC TV show &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot;. The tower can also be seen in the 1999 Canadian documentary &quot;Over Canada: An Aerial Adventure&quot;.

The lake scenes from the Canadian film starring Gordon Pinsent called &quot;Away From Her&quot; were also shot in the township on the south shore of Lake of Bays across from Price&#x27;s Point.

<text>The Township of Muskoka Lakes is a municipality of the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. It has a year-round population of 7,652.

The municipal offices are located in Port Carling.

==History==
The area now covered by the township was opened for settlement and organized in 1870 into the following geographic (and sometime municipal) townships of Watt, Cardwell, Humphrey, Christie, Medora and Wood.

In 1971, the current municipal structure took hold when Cardwell Township, Watt Township, Medora and Wood Townships, Bala, Port Carling, Windermere and part of Monck Township were merged.

== Government ==
Muskoka is governed by an elected Town Council consisting of a Mayor, District Councillors and Councillors representing each of the town&#x27;s three wards. In addition, three Regional Councillors each represent a ward each. The Mayor and Councillors sit on the Muskoka County Council.

==Geography==

The township is located on Canadian Shield and thus is marked with outcrops of igneous rock and evergreen trees. Although inland from both Lake Huron&#x27;s Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe, the township contains the Muskoka Lakes consisting of Lake Muskoka, Lake Rosseau and Lake Joseph, amongst many other smaller lakes.

Protected areas in Muskoka Lakes include Hardy Lake Provincial Park and Torrance Barrens Conservation Area.

===Communities===
The township contains the communities of Bala, Bala Park, Bardsville, Barlochan, Beaumaris, Baysville, Bear Cave, Beatrice, Bent River, Brackenrig, Cedar Village, Dee Bank, Dixon&#x27;s Corners, Dudley, Duffy, Echo Beach, Ferndale, Foot&#x27;s Bay, Glen Orchard, Gregory, Gull Rock, Hekkla, Inverness Lodge, Juddhaven, Mendora, Milford Bay, Minett, Morinus, Mortimers Point, Park Beach, Port Carling, Port Keewaydin, Port Sandfield, Raymond, Redwood, Roderick, Rossclair, Rosseau Falls, Rostrevor, Shannon Hall, Sunset Beach, Thorel House, Tomelin Bluffs, Torrance, Ufford, Ullswater, Valley Green Beach, Walkers Point, Willow Beach, Whiteside, Windermere, Woodington, Woodward Station and Ziska.

===Climate===
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Muskoka Lakes had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Economy==
Timber was initially the greatest economic attraction for the region. The soil is poor and rocky and consequently is not especially suited to agriculture.

As the resource industries dried up, the area soon embraced tourism as its economic base because of its proximity to Toronto and the rest of Southern Ontario. For many Ontarians, this is the centre of cottage country.

The Muskoka Lakes Township Public Libraries offers research, literature, and cultural resources to local residents. The libraries consist of the Norma and Miller Alloway Muskoka Lakes Library main branch in the town of Port Carling, and three small branches housed in the community centres of Bala, Milford Bay, and Walker&#x27;s Point.

<text>Philip Frederick Anschutz ( ; born December 28, 1939) is an American billionaire businessman who owns or controls companies in a variety of industries, including energy, railroads, real estate, sports, newspapers, travel, movies, theaters, arenas and music. In 2004, he purchased the parent company of the Journal Newspapers, which under Anschutz&#x27;s direction became the American conservative editorial newspaper &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;. Anschutz is the son of Fred and Marian Pfister Anschutz.

In 1961, he bought out his father&#x27;s oil drilling company, Circle A Drilling, and earned large returns in Wyoming. He invested in stocks, real estate and railroads. He expanded his investments to sports and entertainment companies, co-founding the American soccer league Major League Soccer as well as multiple soccer teams, including the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, Houston Dynamo, San Jose Earthquakes, and the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. Anschutz is the principal owner of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings and was a minority owner of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers until selling his interest in 2021. He also owns stakes in performance venues, including Crypto.com Arena, The O2, London, and the Dignity Health Sports Park. Through his ownership of Walden Media, he has invested in films such as &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot;, and &quot;Joshua&quot;. Through AEG Live, he owns the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Sea Island Resorts and The Broadmoor hotel in Colorado. He is also the namesake of CU Anschutz, the medical campus of the University of Colorado.

In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him the 45th richest person in the United States, with an estimated net worth of $16.9 billion.

==Early life==
Anschutz was born in Russell, Kansas, the son of Marian (née Pfister) and Frederick Benjamin Anschutz. His father was an oil tycoon and land speculator who invested in ranches in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, and eventually went into the oil-drilling business. His grandfather, Carl Anschutz, was an ethnic German who emigrated from Russia and started the Farmers State Bank in Russell. Anschutz grew up in Russell, as did Bob Dole. He also lived in Wichita, and Hays, Kansas. In later years, Anschutz contributed to Dole&#x27;s political campaigns.

Anschutz graduated from Wichita High School East in 1957, and in 1961 earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business from the University of Kansas, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Career==
===Land ownership===
In 1970, Anschutz bought the 250,000-acre (1,000 km2) Baughman Farms, one of the country&#x27;s largest farming corporations, in Liberal, Kansas, for $10 million. The following year, he acquired 9 million acres (36,000 km2) along the Utah-Wyoming border. This produced his first fortune in the oil business. In the early 1980s, the Anschutz Ranch, with its billion-barrel (160,000,000 m³) oil pocket, became the largest oil field discovery in the United States since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1968. In 1982, Anschutz sold an interest in it to Mobil Oil for $500 million.

For several years, Anschutz was Colorado&#x27;s sole billionaire. With his acquisition of land in other Western states, he became one of the 100 largest landholders in the United States.

Anschutz then moved into railroads and telecommunications before venturing into the entertainment industry. In 1999, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine compared him to the 19th-century tycoon J.P. Morgan, as both men &quot;struck it rich in a fundamentally different way: they operated across an astounding array of industries, mastering and reshaping entire economic landscapes.&quot;

===Rail and petroleum businesses===
In 1984, Anschutz entered the railroad business by purchasing the Rio Grande Railroad&#x27;s holding company, Rio Grande Industries. In 1988, the Rio Grande railroad purchased the Southern Pacific Railroad under his direction. With the merger of the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Corporation in September 1996, Anschutz became vice-chairman of Union Pacific. Before the merger, he was a director of Southern Pacific from June 1988 to September 1996, and non-executive chairman of Southern Pacific from 1993 to September 1996. He was also a director of Forest Oil Corporation beginning in 1995. In November 1993, he became director and chairman of the board of Qwest, stepping down as a non-executive co-chairman in 2002 but remaining on the board. He has also been a director for Pacific Energy Partners and served on the boards of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C., and the National Petroleum Council in Washington, D.C.

In May 2001, the Bush administration upheld Anschutz&#x27;s right to drill an exploratory oil well at Weatherman Draw in south-central Montana, where Native American tribes wanted to preserve sacred rock drawings. Environmental groups, preservationists, and ten Native American tribes appealed the decision without success. In April 2002, the Anschutz Exploration Corporation gave up its plans to drill for oil in the area. They donated its leases for oil and gas rights to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has pledged to let the leases expire, and the Bureau of Land Management said it had no plans to permit further leases there and would consider formal withdrawal of the 4,268-acre (17 km2) site from mineral leasing in its 2004 management plan. In recognition of its preservation efforts, The National Trust for Historic Preservation presented its President&#x27;s Award to the Anschutz Exploration Corporation.

In May 2003, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reached a settlement with Anschutz after filing a civil complaint accusing Anschutz of accepting IPO shares from Salomon Smith Barney in exchange for Qwest&#x27;s investment banking business. Anschutz denied any wrongdoing but volunteered to donate a total of $4.4 million to settle the case as long as he selected the recipient organizations in advance. Anschutz paid $100,000 to each of 32 New York nonprofit philanthropic groups, as well as $200,000 to each of six law schools. In return, Spitzer dropped his civil suit. The payment was roughly equal to his profit from the practice of IPO &quot;spinning&quot;; thus, he actually suffered no penalty. Spitzer&#x27;s suit was panned in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial headlined &quot;The Anschutz Ransom&quot;. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice extensively investigated Qwest officials and determined there was no justification for taking action against any board member. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; summarized the implications for Anschutz: &quot;Not only is Qwest founder and board member Philip Anschutz not a defendant in the long-awaited civil case against the regime of former Qwest chief executive Joe Nacchio, he doesn&#x27;t even merit a mention in the 50-page complaint.&quot;

In February 2006, the Denver &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; reported that Anschutz would not run for reelection to the boards of Qwest and Union Pacific and would resign from the board of Regal Entertainment Group so as to focus on his other investments.

On June 24, 2008, it was announced that Anschutz would buy Xanterra Parks and Resorts, which had purchased the Grand Canyon Railway in 2007. In 2011, it was announced that Anschutz had purchased the Oklahoma Publishing Company, and as part of their assets The Broadmoor and the Manitou and Pike&#x27;s Peak Railway in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs respectively.

Effective August 1, 2010, Xanterra Parks and Resorts purchased and assumed management of Kingsmill Resort. Xanterra purchased the resort from Busch Properties, Inc. (BPI).

===Anschutz Entertainment Group===
The Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) is a sporting and music entertainment presenter and a subsidiary of The Anschutz Corporation. It is the world&#x27;s largest owner of sports teams, sports events, and sports venues. It is also the owner of entertainment venues and under AEG Live the world&#x27;s second-largest presenter of live music and entertainment events after Live Nation. Through AEG Live, it owns the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

On September 18, 2012, Anschutz announced he was putting AEG up for sale, but he decided not to accept any of the bids, and on March 14, 2013, took AEG off the market.

====Sports====
In 2012, &quot;SportsBusiness Journal&quot; named Anschutz the fifth most influential person in sports business in its annual survey of the &quot;50 Most Influential People in Sports Business.&quot;

=====Soccer=====
Anschutz is one of only four recipients of the National Soccer Hall of Fame&#x27;s Medal of Honor for his contributions to growing the sport of soccer in the United States. In 2006 &quot;SportsBusiness Journal&quot; ranked Anschutz the most influential person in soccer in the U.S. Anschutz was one of the founders of Major League Soccer and owned several teams for periods of time, including the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, Houston Dynamo, San Jose Earthquakes, D.C. United, and the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. He owns a stake in the Dignity Health Sports Park, the stadium for the MLS team LA Galaxy and former MLS team Chivas USA. For some time, while MLS was struggling, Anschutz owned six MLS franchises concurrently and experienced significant financial losses. For this reason, Anschutz has been called the man who saved MLS. MLS Commissioner Don Garber stated in 2006 that &quot;without Phil Anschutz, there&#x27;s no MLS today&quot;.

Anschutz was instrumental in several MLS initiatives that have grown the league&#x27;s revenues and profits. For example, he pushed for the building of soccer-specific stadiums, allowing MLS teams to increase revenue and better control costs. Anschutz also advocated for MLS&#x27;s creation of Soccer United Marketing, the league&#x27;s sales and marketing arm. He has since sold his stake in the Chicago, Denver, Houston, New York, San Jose and D.C. MLS teams and now owns only the Galaxy.

=====Other sports=====
Anschutz is the principal owner of the Los Angeles Kings. He was a minority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers before selling his stake in the Lakers to Todd Boehly and Mark Walter in 2021. Through ASM Global (formerly AEG), he owns stakes in venues including Crypto.com Arena and O2 Arena.

===Other business ventures===
Anschutz has had several other business ventures, including Forest Oil, Pacific Energy Group, Union Pacific Railroad (he is the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, with a 6% stake), and the Regal Entertainment Group, the second largest movie theater chain in the world, with approximately 7,000 screens. Anschutz owns more than half of the company, and multiple newspapers and media groups.

Anschutz has invested in, for example, the Clarity Media Group, a Denver-based publishing group that includes newspapers such as &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;, the largest newspaper in Oklahoma; &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; (purchased in 2004, sold in November 2011); &quot;The Washington Examiner,&quot; a conservative weekly tabloid that was consolidated from a group of D.C.-area suburban dailies; &quot;The Baltimore Examiner,&quot; which launched in April 2006 and was shut down in early 2009; the now-closed Examiner.com, a hyper-local web portal where contributors wrote on local topics from news to blog-like stories; the conservative &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; (purchased in 2009); and &quot;The Gazette&quot;, Colorado&#x27;s second-largest newspaper, with a daily circulation of 74,172 (purchased on November 30, 2012) (Anschutz has trademarked the name &quot;Examiner&quot; in more than 60 cities.)

On December 14, 2018, Anschultz executed the closure of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; after Editor in Chief, Stephen Hayes, was unsuccessful in an attempt to find a buyer. Existing subscribers were given an alternative of a refund or a subscription to the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;.

Anschutz invested in both the Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, an auction company designed for the oil &amp; gas business, and NRC Broadcasting, which owns a string of radio stations in Colorado. The Anschutz Investment Company also purchased LightEdge Solutions in February 2008. LightEdge is a business-to-business hosted services provider focused on Wide-Area-Networking, Voice-over-IP, Hosted Microsoft applications (Exchange, OCS, SharePoint), hosted servers/storage collocation cage and rackspace and Business Continuity Services.

It was announced on September 15, 2011, that Anschutz would acquire all assets of the Oklahoma Publishing Company (OPUBCO) from the Gaylord and Dickinson families. Upon closing, Anschutz would operate OPUBCO separately from his other publishing and media assets as an independent company. Closing was expected in October 2011. In March 2012, it was reported that Anschutz was interested in buying the Rangers. He also invested in the Power Company of Wyoming LLC, formed in 2007 (re-incorporated in 2010) for the purpose of building the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind power complex in Carbon County, Wyoming, comprising up to 1,000 wind turbines with up to 3,000 megawatts of capacity. It will be sited on 229,077 acres, about half federal, about half privately owned by an affiliate, and a smattering of state lands. According to the Bureau of Land Management, which on July 2, 2012, announced the completion of the project&#x27;s final Environmental Impact Statement, &quot;Chokecherry and Sierra Madre are two distinct sites approximately five miles apart which are both being analyzed together. When combined, they comprise the largest commercial wind generation facility proposed in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world.&quot; Construction of the project is currently ongoing, and the cost is an estimated $5 billion.

==Political and social activism==
Anschutz supported the Parents Television Council, a group that protests against television content that they consider indecent. He also financed and distributed films with Christian themes for mass audiences (through his two film production companies and ownership of much of the Regal, Edwards and United Artists theater chains) including &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. He financed The Foundation for a Better Life. In 2009, Anschutz purchased the conservative American opinion magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. In 2010, he financed the pro-charter school film &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot;. 

Through the Anschutz Foundation, he had made grants to conservative think tanks, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. Anschutz contributed $1 million to conservatives during the 2016 U.S. elections, and $200,000 to Republican politicians and political action committees during the 2017 elections.

In 2006, a lawyer for Anschutz wrote a letter to President George W. Bush&#x27;s White House Counsel Harriet Miers recommending Neil Gorsuch to the newly vacant seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit after &quot;The Denver Post&quot; reported that Gorsuch was not actively being considered for the vacancy.

In the wake of the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; decision, the Anschutz Corporation issued the statement that “[a]s a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman&#x27;s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Anschutz is an active philanthropist. He heads the Anschutz Foundation, and was listed 41st on the Forbes 400 list in October 2019, with a net worth of $11.5 billion.

Anschutz and his wife have contributed over $100 million to the new medical, dental, physical therapy, physician assistant, nursing, and pharmacy campus of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, Colorado, now named the Anschutz Medical Campus in their honor. The land came from the recently closed Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, but millions were needed for the construction of new medical laboratory buildings and a new University Hospital on the land. They have also donated to the University of Kansas, their alma mater. There is an Anschutz Library and an Anschutz Sports Pavilion. In recognition of their philanthropic efforts, the Anschutzes received the 2009 William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.

In 2018, Anschutz donated $1 million to Elton John AIDS Foundation.

==Personal life==
He is a conservative Christian and a member of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. He and his wife Nancy, whom he met when he was 16, have three children. Anschutz was inducted into the Kansas Business Hall of Fame in 2000 and the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2002.

Anschutz prefers to stay out of the limelight. He has granted only three formal interviews since 1979, and none from the 1980s until 2015. On December 6, 2015, he broke his media silence when he appeared with several of the founders of Major League Soccer to reflect on the league&#x27;s 20th anniversary. 

Anschutz has run 15 marathons.

His first cousin was fellow Russell native and longtime news anchor Wendall Anschutz.

<text>A latifundium (Latin: &quot;latus&quot;, &quot;spacious&quot;, and &quot;fundus&quot;, &quot;farm&quot;, &quot;estate&quot;) was originally the term used by ancient Romans for great landed estates specialising in agriculture destined for sale: grain, olive oil, or wine. They were characteristic of Magna Graecia and Sicily, Egypt, Northwest Africa and Hispania Baetica. The &quot;latifundia&quot; were the closest approximation to industrialised agriculture in antiquity, and their economics depended upon slavery.

In the modern colonial period, the word was borrowed in Portuguese &quot;latifúndios&quot; and Spanish &quot;latifundios&quot; or simply &quot;fundos&quot; for similar extensive land grants, known as &quot;fazendas&quot; (in Portuguese) or &quot;haciendas&quot; (in Spanish), in their empires.

==Ancient Rome==
The basis of the &quot;latifundia&quot; notably in Magna Graecia (the south of Italy including Sicilia) and Hispania, was the &quot;ager publicus&quot; (state-owned land) that was confiscated from conquered people beginning in the 3rd century BC. As much as a third of the arable land of a new province was taken for &quot;agri publici&quot; and then divided up with at least the fiction of a competitive auction for leased estates rather than outright ownership. 

Later, the practice of establishing agricultural &quot;coloniae&quot;, especially from the early 1st century BC, as a way to reward Roman army veterans created smaller landholdings, which would then be acquired by large landowners in times of economic distress. Such consolidation into fewer hands, mainly Roman patricians, was not universally approved of, but efforts to reverse the trend by agrarian laws were generally unsuccessful. 

Later in the Roman Empire, as leases were inherited, ownership of the former common lands became established by tradition, and the leases became taxable. Ownership of land, organised in the &quot;latifundia&quot;, defined the Roman Senatorial class as it was their only socially acceptable source of wealth (as a result of the farmer-soldier tradition of Cinncinatus).

&quot;Latifundia&quot; included a &quot;villa rustica&quot;, including an often luxurious owner&#x27;s residence, and the operation of the farm relied on a large number of Roman slaves, sometimes kept in an &quot;ergastulum&quot;. They produced agricultural products for sale and profit such as livestock (sheep and cattle) or olive oil, grain, garum and wine. Nevertheless, Rome had to import grain (in the Republican period, from Sicily and North Africa; in the Imperial era, from Egypt).

The &quot;latifundia&quot; quickly started economic consolidation as larger estates achieved greater economies of scale and productivity, and senator owners did not pay land taxes. Owners re-invested their profits by purchasing smaller neighbouring farms, since smaller farms had lower productivity and could not compete, in an ancient precursor of agribusiness. 

&quot;Latifundia&quot; also expanded to the Roman provinces of Mauretania (modern Maghreb) and in Hispania Baetica (modern Andalusia) with conquest of those areas.

The &quot;latifundia&quot; distressed Pliny the Elder (died AD 79) as he travelled, seeing only slaves working the land, not the sturdy Roman farmers who had been the backbone of the Republic&#x27;s army. His writings can be seen as a part of the conservative reaction to the profit-oriented new attitudes of the upper classes of the Early Empire. He argued that the &quot;latifundia&quot; had ruined Italy and would ruin the Roman provinces as well. He reported that at one point, just six owners possessed half of the province of Africa, which may be a piece of rhetorical exaggeration as the North African cities were filled with flourishing landowners who filled the town councils.

As small farms were bought up by the wealthy with their vast supply of slaves, the newly landless peasantry moved to the city of Rome, where they became dependent on state subsidies. Free peasants did not completely disappear. Many became tenants on estates that were worked in two ways: partly directly controlled by the owner and worked by slaves, and partly leased to tenants.

The production system of the &quot;latifundia&quot; went into crisis between the 1st and 2nd century as the supply of slaves dwindled due to lack of new conquests. 

==Italy==
In the 6th century, Cassiodorus was able to apply his own &quot;latifundia&quot; to support his short-lived &quot;Vivarium&quot; in the heel of Italy.

In Sicily, &quot;latifundia&quot; dominated the island from medieval times. They were only abolished by sweeping land reform mandating smaller farms in 1950–1962, funded from the &quot;Cassa per il Mezzogiorno&quot;, the Italian government&#x27;s development fund for southern Italy (1950–1984).

==Spain==
In the Iberian Peninsula, the &quot;Reconquista&#x27; of Muslim territories of Spain, the Al-Andalus, by the Kingdom of Castile provided the Christian kingdom with sudden extensions of land, which the kings gave as a reward to nobility, mercenaries and military orders to exploit as &quot;latifundia&quot;, which had been first established as the commercial olive oil and grain &quot;latifundia&quot; of Roman Hispania Baetica. The gifts finished the traditional small private ownership of land, eliminating a social class that had also been typical of the al-Andalus period.

In the Iberian peninsula, the possessions of the Church did not pass to private ownership until the ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal (), the secularization of church-owned &quot;latifundia&quot;, which proceeded in pulses through the 19th century.

Big areas of Andalusia are still populated by an underclass of &quot;jornaleros&quot;, landless peasants who are hired by the latifundists as &quot;day workers&quot; for specific seasonal campaigns. The &quot;jornalero&quot; class has been fertile ground for socialism and anarchism. Still today, among the main Andalusian trade unions is the Rural Workers Union (&quot;Sindicato Obrero del Campo&quot;), a far-left group famous for their squatting campaigns in the town of Marinaleda, Province of Seville.

<doc id="483650" wikidata="Q2842504" url="?curid=483650" title="Amdahl Corporation">
<text>Amdahl Corporation was an information technology company which specialized in IBM mainframe-compatible computer products, some of which were regarded as supercomputers competing with those from Cray Research. Founded in 1970 by Gene Amdahl, a former IBM computer engineer best known as chief architect of System/360, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu since 1997. The company was located in Sunnyvale, California.

From its first machine in 1975, Amdahl&#x27;s business was to provide mainframe computers that were plug-compatible with contemporary IBM mainframes, but offering higher reliability, running somewhat faster, and costing somewhat less. They often had additional practical advantages as well, in terms of size, power requirements, of being air-cooled instead of requiring a chilled water supply. This offered a price/performance ratio superior to the IBM lineup, and made Amdahl one of the few real competitors to &quot;Big Blue&quot; in the very high-margin computer market segment. The company won about 8% of the mainframe business worldwide, but was a market leader in some regions, most notably in the Carolinas. Proverbially, savvy IBM customers liked to have Amdahl coffee mugs visible in their offices when IBM salespeople came to visit.

As the mainframe market began to change in the later 1980s, Amdahl was increasingly diversified, becoming a major supplier of UNIX and open systems software and servers, data storage subsystems, data communications products, application development software, and a variety of educational and consulting services.

== Company history ==

===ACS===
From 1965, Gene Amdahl had been working at IBM on the IBM Advanced Computer Systems project (ACS), which intended to introduce what would be the world&#x27;s fastest computer. During a shake-up of the project in early 1968, Amdahl suggested the company to abandon the ACS-1 concept and instead use the techniques and circuit designs to build a System/360 compatible design. In a &quot;shoot out&quot; between the two concepts that spring, Amdahl&#x27;s concept won. Many of the managers of the ACS left, and Amdahl was placed in charge of developing the new concept.

In July 1969, IBM sent out a memo stating that their older software was going to be released into the public domain and that new software would be sold as separate line items, not part of the purchase of a system. This was mostly due to ongoing antitrust investigations launched by 3rd party software companies like Applied Data Research, who complained that IBMs policy of giving away software was hurting the entire market. With the software now a separate product, Amdahl saw the possibility of IBM-compatible machines; if the software was sold separately, then IBM could not refuse to sell it to other computers or they would violate those same anti-trust rules.

In May 1969, Amdahl outlined a series of three machines developed from the ACS concept. This followed IBM&#x27;s pricing model of offering a series of designs that were separated by about three times in performance and two times in cost, offering customers a reason to upgrade to a larger system. To make the top-end system affordable, it would have to be priced in a way that would push the prices of the smaller systems below what their current machines sold for. Management decided against the plans, and as this essentially ended the ACS effort, Amdahl suggested they shut down the lab. They did so, and Amdahl left the company shortly thereafter in early 1970, telling them of his plans to introduce compatible machines.

===Forming Amdahl===
Meeting with several other former ACS engineers, a new concept emerged. Instead of attempting to make the fastest computer using the most tightly packed circuit boards possible with current technology, they would instead design a much looser arrangement of five by five components on a standardized card. Although a machine using these cards would not be able to run as fast as ACS, they would be much easier to design and cheaper to build. A key concept in the system was the automated layout of the circuit board interconnections using software running on IBM 1130 computers. Looking for partners to produce the circuits, they found Motorola was interested in doing so as long as Amdahl would provide the routing software to them first. Amdahl concluded they would take the software and not deliver the chips. After talking to National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments with no result, they finally signed with Advanced Memory Systems.

The company found it extremely difficult to arrange funding for development. Much of this was due to the venture capital industry&#x27;s feeling that attempting to compete with IBM was doomed; RCA had spent billions developing and marketing their Spectra 70 series and had yet to come close to a profit, while Xerox had attempted a different attack by buying Scientific Data Systems and was suffering as a result. The effort was saved by Amdahl&#x27;s relationship with Fujitsu, which allowed him to arrange a meeting with their high-ranking engineers. After three days of intensive meetings, their lead engineer had enough and said they were going to invest $5 million. This news prompted a surprise investment of the same amount from Nixdorf. Worried this would dilute their influence, Fujitsu then invested another 5 million. The company was officially launched in 1971.

===470 series===

During this period, IBM announced their new System/370 series. These were, initially at least, System/360&#x27;s with new electronics that allowed them to run faster and be less expensive in comparison to the 360&#x27;s they replaced. Amdahl&#x27;s new target was to offer a lower-cost version of the high-end member of the 370 family. Amdahl felt that this would trap IBM in their own pricing structure; if they lowered the cost of their high-end machine, they would be forced to lower the cost of their lower-end offerings where they made much of their profit. The new machines were given the name 470/6.
Amdahl engineers, working with Fujitsu circuit designers, developed unique, air-cooled chips which were based on high-speed emitter-coupled logic (ECL) circuit macros. These chips were packaged in a chip package with a heat-dissipating cooling attachment consisting of a cylindrical arrangement of fins, similar to the heat-dissipating fins on a motorcycle engine, mounted directly on the top of the chip. This patented technology allowed the Amdahl mainframes of this era to be completely air-cooled, unlike IBM systems that required chilled water and its supporting infrastructure.

Originally designed for a five-by-five arrangement of components on a card, during development this evolved into a six-by-seven array on multi-layer cards (up to 14 layers), which were then mounted in vertical columns in the computer chassis. The cards had eight connectors attached to micro-coaxial cables that interconnected the system components. A conventional backplane was not used in the central processing units. The card columns held at least three cards per side (two per column in rare exceptions, such as the processor&#x27;s &quot;C-Unit&quot;). Each column had two large &quot;Tarzan&quot; fans (a &quot;pusher&quot; and a &quot;puller&quot;) to move the considerable amount of air needed to cool the chips. Each system included a Data General Nova 1200 programmed to support the CRT console and to accept the same channel command operations as the IBM 3066 on the 370/165 and 370/168.
At the time, the 370 lacked virtual memory, which was criticized in the computer press. In 1972, IBM announced a new series of 370 systems that would include this feature, which they referred to as &quot;dynamic address translation&quot;. Amdahl modified their design to match, becoming the 470V/6, for &quot;virtual&quot;. The machine began to take form in 1974 after several manufacturing issues were resolved. The machine was about twice as fast as the contemporary 370/168 at about the same price. It also occupied one-third as much floor space, and as it lacked the water cooling system, it was much easier to install and maintain.

The first 470V/6 machine, serial number 00001, was delivered to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in June 1975. It was installed and commissioned in five days, compared to the two or three weeks required for similar IBM machines. The second was delivered to the University of Michigan. Texas A&amp;M received theirs in October and Computer Usage Corporation in November. By August 1977, 55 systems had been installed and the production line had to be expanded from four to six machines a month.

For the next quarter-century, Amdahl and IBM competed aggressively against one another in the high-end mainframe market. At its peak, Amdahl had a 24% market share. Amdahl owed some of its success to antitrust settlements between IBM and the U.S. Department of Justice, which ensured that Amdahl&#x27;s customers could license IBM&#x27;s mainframe software under reasonable terms. The machines could also use any 360 or 360 peripheral, and while IBM initially refused to maintain these machines when connected to Amdahl systems, they were eventually forced to when Amdahl began making a profit maintaining IBM hardware.

===Later 470s===

In February 1977, Amdahl announced the 470V/6-II, which offered 5 to 15 percent greater performance but at a slightly higher cost. The next month they announced the 470V/5, a smaller system based on the same circuitry that offered about 60 to 70 percent of the performance of the 6-II. Customers could upgrade from the /5 to the /6-II at any time for $780,000. Deliveries began in September 1977. At the same March announcement, they also introduced the 470V/7 as competition to the recently announced IBM 3033 system, a re-implementation of the 370 series using newer circuitry and incorporating some ideas from the ACS project. The first /7&#x27;s shipped in August 1978.
The 470V/8, first shipped in 1980, incorporated high-speed 64 KB cache memories to improve performance, and the first real hardware-based virtualization (known as the &quot;Multiple Domain Facility&quot;).

Amdahl also pioneered a variable-speed feature - the &#x27;470 accelerator&#x27; - on the /5 and /7 systems that allowed the customer to run the CPUs at the higher level of performance of the /6 and /8 systems, respectively, when desired. The customer was charged by the number of hours used. Some at Amdahl thought this feature would anger customers, but it became quite popular as customer management could now control expenses while still having greater performance available when necessary.

===580 series===

In the late 1970s, Amdahl began an effort to develop a next-generation systems architecture under the 580 project. Both the Amdahl engineering teams and Fujitsu strongly suggested developing a multi-processor architecture. Gene Amdahl was against this and wanted to develop a faster single processor. Things came to a head in 1979, and Amdahl left the company in August to start Trilogy Systems. With Gene Amdahl&#x27;s departure, and increasing influence from Fujitsu, Amdahl entered the large-scale multiprocessor market in the mid-1980s with the 5860, 5870 (attached processor) and 5880 (full multiprocessor) models.

In the 580 systems, the chips were mounted in an 11-by-11 array on multi-layer boards called Multi-Chip Carriers (MCCs) that were positioned in high-airflow for cooling. The MCCs were mounted horizontally in a large rectangular frame. The MCCs slid into a complex physical connection system. The processor &quot;side panels&quot; interconnected the system, providing clock propagation delays that maintained race-free synchronous operation at relatively high clock frequencies (15–18  ns base clock cycles). This processor box was cooled by high-speed fans generating horizontal airflow across the MCCs.

Along the way, Amdahl came to believe that its best bet at competing with IBM head-to-head was to &quot;bulk up&quot;, in particular, executing a merger with a well-known vendor in the enterprise storage space. Most Amdahl mainframe customers would purchase storage devices (hard disk and tape drives) from IBM or its plug-compatible competitors. Amdahl first attempted a merger with one of the largest of these vendors, Memorex, in 1979. After this deal fell through, Amdahl went much further on a deal to merge with Colorado-based Storage Technology Corporation (STC). The deal was approved by the boards of both companies, and detailed plans were in place to implement the merger, when Fujitsu, an important partner and major shareholder of Amdahl at the time, objected to the deal which forced it to collapse. STC later tried to develop its own mainframe computer, the failure of which contributed to it filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1984. Around that same time, Amdahl agreed to allow Fujitsu to acquire just under half of Amdahl, leading to its ultimate acquisition of all of Amdahl&#x27;s shares some years later.

In the 1980s, Amdahl entered the IBM-compatible peripherals business in front-end processors and storage products, shipping its first 4705 communications controller in August 1980 and its first 6000 DASD in August 1982. These products were very successful for a number of years with the support of Jack Lewis, the former CEO of Amdahl. The reliance upon a limited product line, restricted to containment within the complex business of mainframes and their highly valuable peripherals, constrained the company&#x27;s hardware business when market forces shifted to x86-based processors. This had been foreseen, leading to an increasing emphasis on software and consulting services.

=== Market exit ===
By the early 1990s, Amdahl was suffering losses of several hundred million dollars per quarter as a result of declining mainframe sales. Management decided to lay off 900 employees in 1992, 1,100 in early 1993, and another 1,800 (out of the 7,400 remaining) later in that year, as well as canceling hardware development projects in favor of reselling computers from Sun Microsystems.

Amdahl perhaps enjoyed its best success during IBM&#x27;s transition from bipolar to CMOS technology in the early to mid-1990s. The first generations of IBM&#x27;s CMOS mainframe processors, the IBM 9672 G3 and G4, could not perform as well as those from the Enterprise System/9000 family, which were based on bipolar technology, giving Amdahl a temporary advantage. However, IBM&#x27;s CMOS strategy paid off in the long run, allowing IBM&#x27;s Poughkeepsie factory to produce even faster mainframes at a lower cost as the technology matured. By the time IBM introduced its 64-bit zSeries 900 in 2000, Amdahl&#x27;s hardware business could no longer compete with IBM with its Millennium and OmniFlex servers that only had 31-bit-addressing. In late 2000, Fujitsu/Amdahl announced that the company had no plans to invest the estimated US$1 billion (or more) to create an IBM-compatible 64-bit system.

Amdahl also failed in its effort to introduce its ObjectStar software (initially known as Huron) during this period and the product later became the object of a successful management buyout. ObjectStar was subsequently acquired by the integration software vendor TIBCO in 2005.

== Amdahl customer options ==
z/OS 1.5 is the last release of IBM&#x27;s flagship operating system still able to run on 31-bit mainframes, including Amdahl and older IBM systems. IBM effectively ended support for z/OS 1.5 on March 29, 2007. In May 2006, IBM announced that the next version of z/VSE, Version 4, would require a 64-bit system, signaling the end to 31-bit support for that operating system. z/TPF, which became available in December 2005, also requires a 64-bit system. The 31-bit Linux distributions will survive as long as the open source community and distributors have an interest. So while there is still some potential life for Amdahl&#x27;s hardware, the transition to 64-bit systems is essentially complete. Some companies and governments still had Amdahl systems performing useful work into mid-2006, and Fujitsu/Amdahl promised support to those customers with replacement parts and other services through March 31, 2009.

Arguably IBM did not have a suitable replacement model for many Amdahl customers until the May 2004 introduction of the zSeries 890. The previous zSeries 800 also became an attractive replacement for Amdahl machines by late 2005 as that model&#x27;s typical used price fell below $100,000 and continued to fall. The System z9 BC model, introduced in May 2006, increased IBM&#x27;s attractiveness yet again, and the BC drove z800 and z890 prices down even more. The late 2008 introduction of the IBM System z10 BC yet again made IBM&#x27;s equipment more enticing. In fact, Fujitsu/Amdahl now sells used IBM mainframes and offers services to migrate customers to the IBM machines (This migration is straightforward and comparable to upgrading from one IBM model to a newer IBM model). The IBM z13 is the last z Systems server to support running an operating system in ESA/390 architecture mode; z14, and future machines will support only 64-bit operating systems. Other, generally less attractive options include running without support, rewriting applications, or possibly running applications under FLEX-ES. FLEX-ES is a mainframe instruction set emulator that supports ESA/390 and, in some cases, z/Architecture operating systems and software.

The vestiges of Amdahl&#x27;s ESA/390 emulation project were resurrected under a new name: Platform Solutions Inc. Using capital from Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, and other major investors they designed a line of Itanium-based computers and software to emulate z/Architecture machines so that they could run zSeries operating systems, with zSeries channels for attaching real IBM equipment as well as virtual simulators for most hardware to minimize the need for IBM&#x27;s peripheral equipment. Its LPARs hosted not only IBM operating systems but 64-bit Intel Itanium Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, and potentially other operating systems.

Platform Solutions started shipping its machines in the first quarter of 2007. This action precipitated a lawsuit from IBM, citing patent infringement and PSI&#x27;s failure to negotiate a z/Architecture license, and IBM refused to license its operating systems and software on PSI&#x27;s machines. Platform Solutions countered that by &quot;tying&quot; the sale of its software to the sale of its hardware, IBM was in violation of its prior anti-trust agreement with the U.S. Justice Dept. In July 2008, IBM acquired PSI, and both companies dropped their lawsuits against each other. PSI&#x27;s machines are no longer available.

==Fujitsu GS21==
Fujitsu continues to sell its &quot;GlobalServer&quot; (GS21) mainframe models in the Japanese domestic market. The GS21 machines are essentially ESA/390 (31-bit) instruction set processors largely based on Amdahl-designed technologies but are only compatible with Fujitsu&#x27;s domestic market operating systems: OSIV/MSP-EX and OSIV/XSP. MSP is most similar to classic IBM MVS/ESA, and XSP is most similar to classic IBM VSE/ESA. Fujitsu GS21 mainframe hardware would most closely correspond to the late 1990s IBM G5 or G6 mainframes in terms of their instruction set support. Fujitsu has stated the company has no intention to license or implement z/Architecture (64-bit).

Fujitsu will discontinue their GS21 mainframe with end-of-sale in 2030, and end-of-support in 2035 &quot;to promote customer modernization&quot;.

<doc id="483651" wikidata="Q1454302" url="?curid=483651" title="Freedoms of the air">
<text>The freedoms of the air, also called five freedoms of air transport, are a set of commercial aviation rights granting a country&#x27;s airlines the privilege to enter and land in another country&#x27;s airspace. They were formulated as a result of disagreements over the extent of aviation liberalisation in the Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944, known as the Chicago Convention. The United States had called for a standardized set of separate air rights to be negotiated between states, but most other countries were concerned that the size of the U.S. airlines would dominate air travel if there were not strict rules. The freedoms of the air are the fundamental building blocks of the international commercial aviation route network. The use of the terms &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;right&quot; confers entitlement to operate international air services only within the scope of the multilateral and bilateral treaties (air services agreements) that allow them.

The first two freedoms concern the passage of commercial aircraft through foreign airspace and airports, while the other freedoms are about carrying people, mail and cargo internationally. The first through fifth freedoms are officially enumerated by international treaties, especially the Chicago Convention. Several other freedoms have been added, and although most are not officially recognised under broadly applicable international treaties, they have been agreed to by a number of countries. The lower-numbered freedoms are relatively universal while the higher-numbered ones are rarer and more controversial. Liberal open skies agreements often represent the least restrictive form of air services agreements and may include many if not all freedoms. They are relatively rare, but examples include the recent single aviation markets established in the European Union (European Common Aviation Area), and between Australia and New Zealand.

==Overview==
Freedoms of the air apply to commercial aviation. The terms &#x27;freedom&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; are a shorthand way of referring to the type of international services permitted between two or more countries. Even when such services are allowed by countries, airlines may still face restrictions to accessing them by the terms of treaties or for other reasons.

==Transit rights==
The first and second freedoms grant rights to pass through a country without carrying traffic that originates or terminates there and are known as &#x27;transit rights&#x27;. The Chicago Convention drew up a multilateral agreement in which the first two freedoms, known as the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA) or &quot;Two Freedoms Agreement&quot;, were open to all signatories. At the end of 2017, the treaty was accepted by 133 countries.

A country granting transit rights may impose fees for the privilege. The reasonableness of such fees has caused controversy at times.

===First freedom===


The first freedom is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing. It grants the privilege to fly over the territory of a treaty country without landing. Member states of the International Air Services Transit Agreement grant this freedom (as well as the second freedom) to other member states, subject to the transiting aircraft using designated air routes. As of the summer of 2007, 129 countries were parties to this treaty, including such large ones as the United States, India, and Australia. However, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China never joined, with Canada leaving the treaty in 1988. These large and strategically located non-IASTA-member states prefer to maintain tighter control over foreign airlines&#x27; overflight of their airspace and negotiate transit agreements with other countries on a case-by-case basis. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and China did not allow airlines to enter their airspace. There were flights from Europe to Japan that refueled in Alaska. Since the end of the Cold War, first freedom rights are almost completely universal. Most countries require prior notification before an overflight and charge fees, which can sometimes be substantial.

IASTA allows each member country to charge foreign airlines &quot;reasonable&quot; fees for using its airports (which is applicable, presumably, only to the second freedom) and &quot;facilities&quot;; according to IATA, such fees should not be higher than those charged to domestic airlines engaged in similar international services. Such fees indeed are commonly charged merely for the privilege of the overflight of a country&#x27;s national territory, when no airport usage is involved. (Overflights might still be using services of a country&#x27;s air traffic control centers). For example, the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S., an IASTA signatory, charges overflight fees based on the great circle distance between an aircraft&#x27;s points of entry into and exit from U.S.-controlled airspace. This transit is then divided into overland (referred to as &quot;en route&quot;) and oceanic components; the latter include flights over international waters where air traffic is controlled by the U.S., including sections of Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and much of the northern Pacific Ocean. Since 2019 these have been charged at for &quot;en route&quot; components, and for the oceanic components.

Countries that are not signatories of the IASTA charge overflight fees as well; among them, Russia is known for charging high fees, especially on the transarctic routes (between North America and Asia) that cross Siberia. In 2008, Russia temporarily denied Lufthansa Cargo permission to overfly its airspace with cargo ostensibly due to &quot;delayed payments for its flyover rights&quot;. In 2008, European airlines were paying Russia €300 million a year for flyover permissions.

Due to the Russo-Ukrainian War, in 2022 the US, EU and other countries cancelled the third and fourth freedoms for Russian airlines, preventing them flying to these countries. In response Russia blocked all freedoms for western airlines, including the first freedom. Flights from the EU to Japan now fly over central Asia and China instead. Chinese and other airlines continue to fly over Russia.

===Second freedom===
The second freedom allows without the embarking or disembarking of passengers or cargo. It is the right to stop in one country solely for refueling or other maintenance on the way to another country. Because of longer range of modern airliners, second freedom rights are comparatively rarely exercised by passenger carriers today, and then often as fifth freedom, allowing new passengers to embark at the stop. But second freedom rights are widely used by air cargo carriers, and are more or less universal between countries.

The most famous example of the second freedom is Shannon Airport (Ireland), which was used as a stopping point for most transatlantic flights until the 1960s, since Shannon Airport was the closest European airport to the United States. Anchorage was similarly used for flights between Western Europe and East Asia, bypassing Soviet airspace, closed until the end of the Cold War. Anchorage was still used by some Chinese airlines for flights to the U.S. and Toronto until the 2000s. Flights between Europe and South Africa often stopped at Ilha do Sal (Sal Island) in Cabo Verde, off the coast of Senegal, due to many African nations refusing to allow South African flights to overfly their territory during the Apartheid regime. Gander, Newfoundland was also a frequent stopping point for airlines from the USSR and the Eastern Bloc on the way to the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, and South America.

==Traffic rights==
In contrast to transit rights, &#x27;traffic rights&#x27; allow commercial international services between, through and in some cases within the countries that are parties to air services agreements or other treaties. While it was agreed that the third to fifth freedoms would be negotiated between states, the International Air Transport Agreement (or &quot;Five Freedoms Agreement&quot;) was also opened for signatures, encompassing the first five freedoms. The remaining four freedoms are made possible by some air services agreements but are not &#x27;officially&#x27; recognized because they are not mentioned by the Chicago Convention.

===Third and fourth freedoms===
The third and fourth freedoms allow basic international service between two countries. Even when reciprocal third and fourth freedom rights are granted, air services agreements (e.g. the Bermuda Agreements) may still restrict many aspects of the traffic, such as the capacity of aircraft, the frequency of flights, the airlines permitted to fly and the airports permitted to be served. The third freedom is the right to carry passengers or cargo from one&#x27;s own country to another. The right to carry passengers or cargo from another country to one&#x27;s own is the fourth freedom. Third and fourth freedom rights are almost always granted simultaneously in bilateral agreements between countries.

===Beyond rights===
Beyond rights allow the carriage of traffic between (and sometimes within) countries that are foreign to the airlines that operate them. Today, the most controversial of these are fifth freedom rights. Less controversial but still restricted at times, though relatively more common are sixth freedom rights.

Beyond rights also encompass international flights with a foreign intermediate stop where passengers may only embark and disembark at the intermediate point on the leg of the flight that serves the origin of an airline operating it. It also includes &#x27;stopover&#x27; traffic where passengers may embark or disembark at an intermediate stop as part of an itinerary between the endpoints of a multi-leg flight or connecting flights. Some international flights stop at multiple points in a foreign country and passengers may sometimes make stopovers in a similar manner, but because the traffic being carried does not originate in the country where the flight takes place it is not cabotage but another form of beyond rights.

====Fifth freedom====
The fifth freedom allows an airline to carry revenue traffic between foreign countries as a part of services connecting the airline&#x27;s own country. It is the right to carry passengers from one&#x27;s own country to a second country, and from that country onward to a third country (and so on). An example of a fifth freedom traffic right is an Emirates flight in 2004 from Dubai to Brisbane, Australia and onward to Auckland, New Zealand, where tickets can be sold on any sector.

Fifth freedom traffic rights are intended to enhance the economic viability of an airline&#x27;s long haul routes, but tend to be viewed by local airlines and governments as potentially unfair competition. The negotiations for fifth freedom traffic rights can be lengthy, because in practice the approval of at least three different nations is required.

Fifth freedom traffic rights were instrumental to the economic viability of long-haul flight until the early 1980s, when advances in technology and increased passenger volume enabled the operation of more non-stop flights. The excess capacity on multi-sector routes could be filled by picking up and dropping off passengers along the way. It was not uncommon for carriers to schedule stops in one or more foreign countries on the way to a flight&#x27;s final destination. Fifth freedom flights were common between Europe and Africa, South America and the Far East. An example of a multi-sector flight in the mid-1980s was an Alitalia service from Rome to Tokyo via Athens, Delhi, Bangkok and Hong Kong. Fifth freedom flights remained highly common in East Asia during the 2000s, particularly on routes serving Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Between the latter two destinations, in 2004, service was provided by at least four airlines whose home base was not in either Hong Kong or Bangkok. The Singapore-Bangkok route has also constituted an important fifth freedom market. In the late 1990s, half of the seats available between the two cities were offered by airlines holding fifth freedom traffic rights. Other major markets served by fifth freedom flights can be found in Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Tasman Sea.

Fifth freedom traffic rights are sought by airlines wishing to take up unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic as a way of promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing traffic rights too much in order to protect a flag carrier&#x27;s commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth freedom traffic rights stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers&#x27; service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous in granting fifth freedom traffic rights, while sixth freedom traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.

The Japan-United States bilateral air transport agreement of 1952 has been viewed as being particularly contentious because unlimited fifth freedom traffic rights have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government&#x27;s refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that only about 10% of the traffic on the Japan—Australia sector was third and fourth freedom traffic to and from the US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under those rights. Japan had held many unused fifth freedom traffic rights beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth freedom traffic rights enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and also geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan&#x27;s favourable geographical location and its flag airlines&#x27; carriage of a sizeable volume of sixth freedom traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers&#x27; access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.

Up until the 1980s, Air India&#x27;s flights to New York JFK from India were all operated under fifth freedom rights. From its 1962 initiation of Boeing 707 service to Idlewild (renamed JFK in 1964), flights had intermediate stops at one Middle East airport (Kuwait, Cairo, or Beirut), then two or three European airports, the last of which was always London&#x27;s Heathrow, with trans-Atlantic service operating between Heathrow and JFK. This service continued well into the Boeing 747 era. Currently, Air India&#x27;s North American flights are nonstop Boeing 777 service to India, with one exception, that being a revival of fifth freedom flights operating Boeing 787 service on the Newark—Heathrow—Ahmedabad route. However, Air India does not currently operate that route.

The fifth freedom has been discussed in 2017 in connection with the Saint Helena Airport. Flights (by a South African airline) serving it have to refuel at Walvis Bay Airport; but they are not allowed to board more passengers coming from connecting flights, which means that passengers from Johannesburg must do a detour over Cape Town with fairly little connecting time, with risk of missing the once-weekly flight.

====Sixth freedom====
The unofficial sixth freedom combines the third and fourth freedoms and is the right to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one&#x27;s own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline&#x27;s home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the traffic, like fifth freedom traffic, is secondary in nature to third and fourth freedom traffic. Consequently, some nations seek to regulate sixth freedom traffic as though it were fifth freedom traffic.

Sixth-freedom traffic has historically been widespread in Asia, where Southeast Asian carriers such as Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines carried traffic on the Kangaroo Route between Europe and Australia, and Japanese carriers carried traffic between Southeast Asia and the Americas. More recently, carriers in the Persian Gulf region have developed intercontinental sixth-freedom hubs, and Copa Airlines has developed a sixth-freedom hub in Panama to connect many cities in North and South America. Another example is Air Canada, which has pursued a strategy of carrying passengers between the US and points in Europe and Asia through its Canadian hubs.

While sixth freedom operations are rarely legally-restricted, they may be controversial: for example, Qantas has complained that Emirates, Singapore Airlines and other sixth-freedom carriers have unfair advantages in the market between Europe and Australia.

Because the nature of air services agreements is essentially a mercantilist negotiation that strives for an equitable exchange of traffic rights, the outcome of a bilateral agreement may not be fully reciprocal but rather a reflection of the relative size and geographic position of two markets, especially in the case of a large country negotiating with a much smaller one. In exchange for a smaller state granting fifth freedom rights to a larger country, the smaller country may be able to gain sixth freedom traffic to onward destinations from the larger country.

On 2 October 2007, the United Kingdom and Singapore signed an agreement that allowed unlimited sixth freedom rights from 30 March 2018, along with a full exchange of other freedoms of the air.

===Cabotage===

Cabotage is the transport of goods or passengers between two points in the same country by a vessel or an aircraft registered in another country. Originally a shipping term, cabotage now covers aviation, railways and road transport. It is &quot;trade or navigation in coastal waters, or, the exclusive right of a country to operate the air traffic within its territory&quot;.

====Modified sixth freedom (indirect cabotage) ====
The unofficial modified sixth freedom is the right to carry passengers or cargo between two points in one foreign country, while making a stop in the home country.

For example, (the unofficial modified sixth freedom): a Canadian carrier departs from a US airport, stops in its Canadian hub and departs/continues onward to a different US airport.

====Seventh and ninth freedoms (standalone cabotage)====
The unofficial seventh and ninth freedoms are variations of the fifth freedom. It is the right to carry passengers or cargo in foreign territories without any service to, from or via one&#x27;s own country. The seventh freedom is to provide international services between two foreign countries, and the ninth between points within a single foreign country.

The right to carry passengers or cargo within a foreign country without continuing service to or from one&#x27;s own country, is sometimes known as &quot;stand-alone cabotage&quot;. It differs from the aviation definition of &quot;true cabotage&quot;, in that it does not directly relate to one&#x27;s own country.

====Eighth freedom (consecutive cabotage)====
The unofficial eighth freedom is the right to carry passengers or cargo between two or more points in one foreign country and is also known as &quot;cabotage&quot;.
It is extremely rare outside Europe. The main example is the European Union, where such rights exist between all its member states. Other examples include the Single Aviation Market (SAM) established between Australia and New Zealand in 1996; the 2001 Protocol to the Multilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of International Air Transportation (MALIAT) between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore; United Airlines&#x27; &quot;Island Hopper&quot; route, from Guam to Honolulu, able to transport passengers within the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, although the countries involved are closely associated with the United States. Such rights have usually been granted only where the domestic air network is very underdeveloped. One instance was Pan Am&#x27;s authority to fly between Frankfurt and West Berlin from the 1950s to the 1980s, although political circumstances and not the state of the domestic air network dictated this – only airlines of the Allied Powers of France, the United Kingdom and the United States had the right to carry air traffic between West Germany and the legally separate and distinct territory of West Berlin until 1990. In 2005, the United Kingdom and New Zealand concluded an agreement granting unlimited cabotage rights. Given the distance between the two countries, the agreement can be seen as reflecting a political principle rather than an expectation that these rights will be taken up in the near future. Similarly, New Zealand had exchanged eighth-freedom rights with Ireland in 1999.

<text>Apicius, also known as De re culinaria or De re coquinaria (&quot;On the Subject of Cooking&quot;), is a collection of Roman cookery recipes, which may have been compiled in the fifth century CE, or earlier. Its language is in many ways closer to Vulgar than to Classical Latin, with later recipes using Vulgar Latin (such as &quot;ficatum&quot;, &quot;bullire&quot;) added to earlier recipes using Classical Latin (such as &quot;iecur&quot;, &quot;fervere&quot;). 

The book has been attributed to an otherwise unknown Caelius Apicius, an invention based on the fact that one of the two manuscripts is headed with the words &quot;API CAE&quot; or rather because a few recipes are attributed to Apicius in the text: Patinam Apicianam sic facies (IV, 14) Ofellas Apicianas (VII, 2). It has also been attributed to Marcus Gavius Apicius, a Roman gourmet who lived sometime in the 1st century CE during the reign of Tiberius. The book also may have been authored by a number of different Roman cooks from the first century CE. Many of the recipes contain the ingredient silphium, which is speculated to have become extinct in the first century CE, which supports the earlier date. However, based on textual analysis, the food scholar Bruno Laurioux believes that the surviving version dates only from the fifth century (that is, the end of the Roman Empire): &quot;The history of &quot;De Re Coquinaria&quot; indeed belongs then to the Middle Ages&quot;.

== Organization ==

The Latin text is organized in ten books with Greek titles, in an arrangement similar to that of a modern cookbook:
# &quot;Epimeles&quot; — The Diligent
# &quot;Sarcoptes&quot; — The Butcher
# &quot;Cepuros&quot; — The Gardener
# &quot;Pandectes&quot; — The Encyclopedia
# &quot;Ospreon&quot; — Pulses &amp; Legumes
# &quot;Aeropetes&quot; — The Bird
# &quot;Polyteles&quot; — The Sumptuous
# &quot;Tetrapus&quot; — The Quadruped, Four-legged animals
# &quot;Thalassa&quot; — The Sea, Seafood
# &quot;Halieus&quot; — The Fisherman

== Foods ==

The foods described in the book are useful for reconstructing the dietary habits of the ancient world around the Mediterranean Basin. But the recipes are geared for the wealthiest classes, and a few contain what were exotic ingredients at that time (e.g., flamingo). A sample recipe from Apicius (8.6.2–3) follows:
* Aliter haedinam sive agninam excaldatam: mittes in caccabum copadia. cepam, coriandrum minutatim succides, teres piper, ligusticum, cuminum, liquamen, oleum, vinum. coques, exinanies in patina, amulo obligas. [Aliter haedinam sive agninam excaldatam] agnina a crudo trituram mortario accipere debet, caprina autem cum coquitur accipit trituram.
* Hot kid or lamb stew. Put the pieces of meat into a pan. Finely chop an onion and coriander, pound pepper, lovage, cumin, garum, oil, and wine. Cook, turn out into a shallow pan, thicken with wheat starch. If you take lamb you should add the contents of the mortar while the meat is still raw, if kid, add it while it is cooking.

== Vinidarius ==

In a completely different manuscript, there is also a very abbreviated epitome entitled &quot;Apici excerpta a Vinidario&quot;, a &quot;pocket Apicius&quot; by &quot;an illustrious man&quot; named Vinidarius, made as late as the Carolingian era. The Vinidarius of this book may have been a Goth, in which case his Gothic name may have been Vinithaharjis (𐍅𐌹𐌽𐌹𐌸𐌰𐌷𐌰𐍂𐌾𐌹𐍃), but this is only conjecture; despite being called &quot;illustrious&quot;, nothing about him is truly known.

&quot;Apici excerpta a Vinidario&quot; survives in a single 8th-century uncial manuscript. Despite the title, this booklet is not an excerpt purely from the &quot;Apicius&quot; text we have today, as it contains material not included in the longer &quot;Apicius&quot; manuscripts. Either some text was lost between the time the excerpt was made and the time the manuscripts were written, or there never was a &quot;standard &quot;Apicius&quot; text because the contents changed over time as it was adapted by readers.

==Editions==
Once manuscripts surfaced, there were two early printed editions of &quot;Apicius&quot;, in Milan (1498, under the title &quot;In re quoquinaria&quot;) and Venice (1500). Four more editions in the next four decades reflect the appeal of &quot;Apicius&quot;. In the long-standard edition of C. T. Schuch (Heidelberg, 1867), the editor added some recipes from the Vinidarius manuscript. 

Between 1498 (the date of the first printed edition) and 1936 (the date of Joseph Dommers Vehling&#x27;s translation into English and bibliography of Apicius), there were 14 editions of the Latin text (plus one possibly apocryphal edition). The work was not widely translated, however; the first translation was into Italian, in 1852, followed in the 20th century by two translations into German and French. The French translation by Bertrand Guégan was awarded the 1934 Prix Langlois by the Académie française.

<text>Artificial human companions may be any kind of hardware or software creation designed to give companionship to a person. Various types of large language models (LLMs) are used in the development of AI-based human companions. These can engage in natural and dynamic conversations, provide assistance, offer companionship, and even perform tasks like scheduling or information retrieval. Examples include digital pets, such as the popular Tamagotchi, or robots, such as the Sony AIBO. Virtual companions can be used as a form of entertainment, or they can be medical or functional, to assist the elderly in maintaining an acceptable standard of life.

== Introduction ==
Senior citizens make up an increasing percentage of the population in the Western nations, and, according to Judith Masthoff of the University of Brighton, they tend to live alone and have a limited social network. Studies also show that those elderly living in such circumstances have an increased risk of developing depression and dementia and have a shorter life span than more socially connected seniors.
It has been known to gerontologists for some time that pets -- particularly those such as cats and dogs that exhibit a range of behaviors and emotions -- help prevent depression in the elderly. Studies also show some beneficial results from electronic pets such as Sony&#x27;s Aibo and Omron&#x27;s NeCoRo; however, the therapeutic value of such artificial pets remains limited by the capabilities of technology. A recent solution to physical limitations of technology comes from GeriJoy, in the form of virtual pets for seniors. Seniors can interact with GeriJoy&#x27;s pets by petting them through the multitouch interface of standard consumer-grade tablets, and can even have intelligent conversations with the pets.

Television viewing among the elderly represents a significant percentage of how their waking hours are spent, and the percentage increases directly with age. Seniors typically watch TV to avoid loneliness; yet TV limits social interaction, thus creating a vicious circle.

In 2012 Judith Masthoff, a professor of computer science from the University of Utrech, purports that it is possible to develop an interactive, personalized form of television that would allow the viewer to engage in natural conversation and learn from these conversations, as well as becoming more physically active which can help in the management of Type 2 Diabetes.

Recent research shows the proliferation of this technology, particularly among the younger generation. Another study reveals that young people are increasingly engaging in digital relationships with AI as a form of emotional support. This trend is notably significant for those grappling with social anxiety and depression, as AI provides a unique and accessible resource for managing these challenges.
Such applications have existed for decades. The earliest, such as the &quot;psychologist&quot; program &quot;ELIZA&quot;, did little more than identify key words and feed them back to the user, but Kenneth Colby&#x27;s 1972 PARRY program at Stanford University -- far superior to ELIZA -- exhibited many of the features researchers now seek to put into a dialog system, above all some form of emotional response and having something &quot;it wants to say&quot;, rather than being completely passive like ELIZA. The Internet now has a wide range of chatbots but they are no more advanced, in terms of plausibility as conversationalists, than the systems of forty years ago and most users tire of them after a couple of exchanges. Meanwhile, two developments have advanced the field in different ways: first, the Loebner Prize, an annual competition for the best computer conversationalist, substantially advanced performance. Its winners could be considered the best chatterbots, but even they never approach a human level of capacity as can be seen from the site.

Secondly a great deal of industrial and academic research has gone into effective conversationalists, usually for specific tasks, such as selling rail or airline tickets. The core issue in all such systems is the dialog manager which is the element of system that determines what the system should say next and so appear intelligent or compliant with the task at hand. This research, along with work on computing emotion, speech research and Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) has led to the beginnings of more companionable systems, particularly for the elderly. The EU supported Companions Project is a 4-year, 15-site project to build such companions, based at the University of Sheffield.

== In social work ==
AI applications have emerged in various areas of social work practice. In social work with older adults, AI systems have been increasingly used for fraud prevention in banking, helping protect elderly people who may be vulnerable to financial exploitation.

De Greeff and Belpaeme wrote in 2015 that the social learning of social robots has increased and could become more prominent in coming decades. It is written that &quot;social robots often tend to be designed to portray a character, thus stimulating their anthropomorphisation by human interactants and inviting an interaction-style that is natural to people. Both a robot&#x27;s appearance and behaviour can strengthen interactants&#x27; interpretation of dealing with a social agent, rather than with a piece of equipment&quot;. This substantiates that robots and AI are in the process of being used for communication and support for humans, and AI is used in order to allow technology and robots to become adept at linguistics and social cues.

<text>W Network (often shortened to W) is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment. The channel primarily broadcasts general entertainment programming oriented towards a female audience.

W Network was established in 1995 as the Women&#x27;s Television Network (WTN), which had a focus on women&#x27;s lifestyle programming. The channel was eventually acquired by Corus in 2001 and relaunched under its current branding in 2002. As part of the relaunch, W&#x27;s programming shifted to a mix of both entertainment and lifestyle programming. By 2017, W had moved its lifestyle programming to its sister networks, shifting to a general entertainment format targeting women. In 2018, the channel became part of output deals with Hallmark Media, and later Comcast&#x27;s Peacock and Sky Studios in 2020 (an agreement shared with sister network Showcase). 

The channel is available in two time shifted feeds, East (operating from the Eastern Time Zone) and West (operating from the Pacific Time Zone).

==History==
===As Women&#x27;s Television Network===

In June 1994, Linda Rankin, on behalf of a corporation to be incorporated, (later incorporated as Lifestyle Television (1994) Limited, principally owned by Moffat Communications) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to operate a channel called &quot;Lifestyle Television&quot;, described as offering &quot;information and entertainment programming of particular interest to women.&quot;

The channel subsequently launched on January 1, 1995 as the Women&#x27;s Television Network (WTN). Like Moffat&#x27;s other cable television operations, WTN was headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Linda Rankin served as the president of the network from its launch.

Programming on the network was originally largely focused on lifestyle programming that many had suggested was &quot;feminist&quot; in nature. Such programming included female takes on traditionally male-dominated activities such as fishing and mechanics, with &quot;Natural Angler&quot; and &quot;Car Care&quot;, respectively, while other programs, such as &quot;Go Girl!&quot;, took a comedic approach at parodying typical female-targeted talk shows that discussed subjects such as beauty and fashion. Other programs included films, current affairs, and occasionally athletic-themed.

The channel suffered from low ratings in the start. Of the slew of new channels launched on January 1, 1995, WTN was initially the lowest-rated channel on average. Linda Rankin later resigned in August 1995 citing &quot;differences in management philosophy&quot;.

=== As W Network ===
In December 2000, Shaw Communications announced it intended to purchase Moffat. The deal was later closed in early 2001. Shaw announced in March 2001 that it would sell WTN to Corus Entertainment, a company that it spun off in 1999, for (Shaw had primarily acquired Moffat for its cable television systems). Once Corus took ownership of the channel, it moved operations from Winnipeg to Toronto in mid-January 2002, laying off 50 employees in the process. Corus subsequently relaunched the network as W on April 15, 2002, with a more entertainment-oriented mix of recent dramas and movies. On the same date, Corus launched the west coast feed.

In 2009, Corus Entertainment acquired SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, and relaunched the channel as W Movies — a spin-off of W Network focusing on films aimed towards women, on March 1, 2010. On December 12, 2016, W Movies was closed and replaced by a relaunched, Canadian version of the Cooking Channel.

On August 2, 2011, the channel launched its HD feed, a simulcast of W Network&#x27;s standard-definition Eastern-time feed. The HD feed was added to Bell Satellite TV satellite and Bell Fibe TV channel lineups on March 23, 2012. It was also available on Eastlink, Optik TV, Shaw Direct, SaskTel, Rogers Cable, Cogeco, and Access Communications. On October 1, 2013, an HD feed for the Western-timed channel was launched on Shaw Cable, then on Shaw Direct on September 18, 2019.

====2017–present====
Since the 2017–18 season, W Network has re-oriented its programming towards scripted television series and films. The majority of its lifestyle programming, including the &quot;Property Brothers&quot; franchise, was moved to HGTV (now Home Network), as well as Corus&#x27; other women and lifestyle networks.

==Programming==
W Network primarily broadcasts a mix of television dramas and films. 

On October 25, 2018, Corus announced an output deal with Crown Media Holdings, giving W Network exclusive Canadian rights to original movies and series produced for Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries. W Network carries branded blocks of Hallmark Channel content, including seasonal programming events such as Countdown to Christmas; many of Hallmark&#x27;s productions are filmed in Canada.

In June 2020, Corus reached output agreements with NBCUniversal Global Distribution for Canadian rights to Peacock original series, shared primarily between W and sister network Showcase. The following month, Corus also reached an agreement with sister company Sky Studios. &quot;Devils&quot; served as one of the first to air on W as part of the Sky agreement. As part of the Peacock agreement, the long-running soap opera &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; (which had long-been carried by sister broadcast network Global in simulcast with NBC) moved to W Network in September 2022.

W previously produced and aired unscripted reality shows and lifestyle programming; it was well known for originating the &quot;Love It or List It&quot; and &quot;Property Brothers&quot; franchises seen on HGTV in the U.S. These programs moved to Corus&#x27; other lifestyle networks (particularly HGTV Canada and Slice) following W&#x27;s shift to scripted programming.

* June 19 – After several years of harassment, sabotage, and minor skirmishes between members of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay and North West Companies, a full-scale battle (today known at Battle of Seven Oaks) breaks out between parties led by Cuthbert Grant and Robert Semple.

<text>Land trusts are nonprofit organizations which own and manage land, and sometimes waters. There are three common types of land trust, distinguished from one another by the ways in which they are legally structured and by the purposes for which they are organized and operated:

* A real estate investment trust is a fiduciary arrangement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to own and to manage real property for the benefit of a limited number of beneficiaries.
* A community land trust (CLT)  is a private, nonprofit corporation that acquires, manages, and develops land for a variety of purposes, primarily for the production and stewardship of affordable housing, although many CLTs are also engaged in non-residential buildings and uses.
* A conservation land trust is a private, non-profit corporation in the US that acquires land or conservation easements for the purpose of limiting commercial development and preserving open space, natural areas, waterways, and/or productive farms and forests. 

In the United States, the land owned by the United States government and held in trust for Native American tribes and individuals is sometimes referred to as a land trust.

In Australia, Aboriginal land trusts are a type of non-profit organisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.
== History ==
===Ancient example===
Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king (trustor) which grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds (equity) back to the beneficiary:

===Roman era===
Land trusts have been around at least since Roman times but their clearest history is from the time of King Henry VIII in England. At that time, people used land trusts to hide their ownership of land so they would not have to serve in the military or fulfill other obligations of land ownership. For example, an elder uncle would hold his nephew&#x27;s land so he would not have to join the king&#x27;s army. To end this, King Henry in 1536 passed the Statute of Uses. The statute declared that if one party held land &quot;for the use of&quot; or in trust for another (&quot;beneficiary&quot;), then legal title was vested in the beneficiary. Obviously, if the statute had been given literal effect, there would be no trust law. Shortly after the statute was enacted, however, English courts declared that the statute only applied if the trust was passive, that is, the trustee didn&#x27;t do anything but hold the land.

===United States===
In late 19th-century Chicago, some people figured out that land trusts would be good for buying property for investors to build skyscrapers on, and city aldermen figured they would be a good way to hide their ownership in land since they were forbidden to vote on city building projects when they owned land nearby. Because the law of England, including the Statute of Uses, was present in US law, the question arose whether a land trust would be valid. This question went to the Illinois Supreme Court. It ruled that if a land trust was set up with some minor duty on the trustee (such as to deed the property to the beneficiaries 20 years later), then the trust would not be considered passive and would be valid. Thus, the land trust in America today is often called an &quot;Illinois-type&quot; land trust or &quot;Illinois Land Trust&quot;.

Land trusts have been actively used in Illinois for over a hundred years and in recent decades have begun to be used in other states. The declaration of a trust is through a &quot;deed to trustee&quot;. If the trust is filed as a public document, it removes all of the asset protection provided by the formation of the land trust. Robert Pless pioneered the use of the land trust that has been used by many firms throughout the United States since the early 1990s.

== Types ==

=== Community land trusts ===

Community land trusts trace their conceptual history to England’s Garden Cities, India&#x27;s Gramdan Movement, and Israel’s cooperative agricultural settlements, the &quot;moshavim&quot;. As Robert Swann and his co-authors noted in &quot;The Community Land Trust: A New Model for Land Tenure in America&quot; (1972): &quot;The ideas behind the community land trust...have historic roots&quot; in the indigenous Americas, in pre-colonial Africa, and in ancient Chinese economic systems. Thus, &quot;the goal is to &#x27;restore&#x27; the land trust concept rather than initiate it.&quot;
=== Real estate investment trusts ===
A real estate investment trust is a fiduciary arrangement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to own and to manage real property for the benefit of a limited number of beneficiaries.
=== Conservation land trusts === 

Land trusts used primarily for the protection and stewardship of natural areas or for the preservation of productive lands for food or fiber are most commonly called conservation land trusts, but may also be called &quot;&#x27;land conservancies&quot;.  They have been in existence since 1891. However, conservation land trusts were not well known before the 1980s. Conservation communities are examples of such land trusts.

==== History ====
The first conservation land trust The Trustees of Reservations was founded in 1891. In 1976, Ben Emory, new director of the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, had begun to call on Boston lawyer Kingsbury Browne for advice on federal tax issues related to conservation easements. Emory recruited a handful of other land trusts as clients for Browne’s periodic tax letters, and a small communications network of land trusts evolved.

When Congress considered new legislation relating to tax deductibility of easements, the Brandywine Conservancy, led by Bill Sellers, convened land trusts using easements in December 1979. Browne invited the under-secretary of the Treasury for tax policy, who brought IRS staff Stephen Small. The land trusts agreed to hire lobbyists and coordinate efforts to influence the legislation, winning expansion of the conservation purposes for which easements would qualify for deductibility.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, the Trust for Public Land sponsored a small gathering in San Francisco of established and newly forming Western land trusts in February 1978.

By 1980, more than 400 local and regional land trusts existed, most still in the North-east, three-fourths with no paid staff, and half with annual budgets under $50,000. The majority of land was protected by fee ownership, but the use of conservation easements was growing.

Then influences converged: the geographic spread resulting in isolation of newer land trusts; recognition of the difficulty of influencing vital legislation; and the growing engagement of Kingsbury Browne in land conservation, leading to his desire to learn about land trusts across the country. A movement was about to be born.

The number of land trusts steadily increased in the United States, with most forming in the late twentieth century. There are also land trusts working in Canada (e.g. Nature Conservancy of Canada, Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy, Wildlife Preservation Canada, Edmonton &amp; Area Land Trust, Ecotrust Canada, Georgian Bay Land Trust and Thames Talbot Land Trust), Mexico, and other countries worldwide, in addition to international land trusts like The Nature Conservancy and the World Land Trust.

==== Aims ====
The goal of conservation trusts is to preserve sensitive natural areas, farmland, ranchland, water sources, cultural resources or notable landmarks. These include enormous international organizations such as The Nature Conservancy or World Land Trust, as well as smaller organizations that operate on national, state/provincial, county, and community levels. Conservation trusts often, but not always, target lands adjacent to or within existing protected areas. However, land areas that are particularly valuable in terms of natural or cultural resources or are home to endangered plant or wildlife are good candidates for receiving protection efforts.

Land trusts conserve all different types of land. Some protect only farmland or ranchland, others forests, mountains, prairies, deserts, wildlife habitat, cultural resources such as archaeological sites or battlefields, urban parks, scenic corridors, coastlines, wetlands or waterways; it is up to each organization to decide what type of land to protect according to its mission. Some areas have extremely limited public access for the protection of sensitive wildlife, or to allow recovery of damaged ecosystems. 

Many protected areas are under private ownership, which tends to limit access. However, in many cases, land trusts work to eventually open up the land in a limited way to the public for recreation in the form of hunting, hiking, camping, wildlife observation, watersports, or other responsible outdoor activities. This is often with the assistance of community groups or government programs. Some land is also used for sustainable agriculture or ranching, or for sustainable logging. While important, these goals can be seen as secondary to protection of the land from development.

==== Strategies ====
Many different strategies are used to provide this protection, including outright acquisition of the land by the trust. In other cases, the land will remain in private hands, but the trust will purchase a conservation easement on the property to prevent development, or purchase any mining, logging, drilling, or development rights on the land. Trusts also provide funding to assist like-minded private buyers or government organizations to purchase and protect the land forever.

As non-profit organizations, land trusts rely on donations, grants and public land acquisition programs for operating expenses and for acquiring land and easements. Donors often provide monetary support, but it is common for conservation-minded landowners to donate an easement on their land, or the land itself. Some land trusts also receive funds from government programs to acquire, protect, and manage land. Some trusts can afford to pay employees, but many others depend entirely on volunteers. According to the 2005 National Land Trust Census, 31% of land trusts reported having at least one full-time staff member, 54% are all volunteer, and 15% have only part-time staff.

When land is acquired, trusts will sometimes retain ownership of the land in perpetuity, or sell the land to a third party. This third party is often the government, which will usually add the land to an existing protected area, or create a new one entirely. Land trusts were instrumental in the 2004 creation of Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado, as well as the expansion of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park by 50% in 2003. Land trusts also sell land to private buyers, usually with a strict conservation easement attached. 

Land trusts use many different tools in their protection efforts. Land trusts buy or accept donations of land in fee. This means that the landowner will sell fee simple interest to the land trust or will just give the land they own to an organization. Landowners may also sell or donate a conservation easement to a land trust. 

A landowner that donates a conservation easement to a land trust gives up some of the rights associated with the land. For example, the landowner might give up the right to build additional structures, while retaining the right to grow crops. Future owners also will be bound by the conservation easement&#x27;s terms. The land trust is responsible for making sure the easement&#x27;s terms are followed. This is done through monitoring of the land.

Conservation easements offer great flexibility. An easement on property containing rare wildlife habitat might prohibit any development, for example, while an easement on a working farm might allow the addition of agricultural structures. An easement may apply to all or a portion of the property, and need not require public access. Each conservation easement is carefully crafted to meet the needs of the landowner while not jeopardizing the conservation values of the land.

In between selling land or an easement to a land trust is an option called a bargain sale. A bargain sale is where a landowner sells a property interest to an organization for less than the market price. The amount of value between the market price and the actual sale price is considered a donation to the organization. There are other strategies to conserve land as well.

In October 2002, Property and Environment Research Center published a report by Dominic P. Parker entitled &quot;Cost-Effective Strategies for Conserving Private Land&quot;. This paper identified numerous ways for operating land trusts more efficiently, pointing out that conservation easement and other tools for land preservation may be less costly than ownership. Sometimes the various rights associated with land ownership are separable. A preservationist organization may, for instance, buy only the extraction rights on a property with oil or minerals, and then rent those rights to extracters on the organization&#x27;s terms. The terms might include requirements to protect the environment and pay the organization royalties on materials extracted. Many land trust organizations had already been using these strategies for years when this report was published.

==== Structure ====

The Land Trust Alliance, formed in 1981, provides technical support to land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts. The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4 million acres (38,000 km2) of land in the United States, double the 4.7 million acres (19,000 km2) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25 million acres (100,000 km2) in the U.S. have been protected by those organizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the Northeast with 2.9 million acres (12,000 km2), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the Pacific (consisting of California, Nevada, and Hawaii), with protected land increasing 147% to 1.5 million acres (6,100 km2) in 2003.

==Other types==
In the United States; approximately (as of 2008) of land are owned by the United States government and held in trust for Native American tribes and individuals.

In Australia, Aboriginal land trusts are a type of non-profit organisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.

== Tying ==

The knot is tied by forming a turn in the end of a rope, and then passing a bight in the standing part through. The noose knot is a slipped version of the overhand knot.

== Use in hanging ==

The knot most closely associated with execution is the hangman&#x27;s knot, which is also known as the &quot;hangman&#x27;s noose&quot;. Tying is similar to the original noose, but many turns are wrapped around the loop. The reason for this was to make the hanging more humane, as it would break the person&#x27;s neck, killing the person instantly, rather than strangling them to death. A similar method is also commonly used for suicide. Search engines such as Google provide the number of a suicide helpline if a search for &quot;how to tie a noose&quot; is made.

== Use in intimidation and hate-based racial politics ==
In the United States, a noose is sometimes left as a message in order to intimidate people, as it was the main object used in segregation era lynchings. In 2022, a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime was passed. It is illegal to display a noose in a threatening manner in Virginia, New York and Connecticut.

Austin Reed Edenfield, a former student of the University of Mississippi, pled guilty in 2016 to a federal civil-rights crime, acknowledging that he and Graeme Phillip Harris had tied a noose and a flag of Georgia around the neck of a statue honoring James Meredith, the university&#x27;s first African-American student. Harris was sentenced to prison and Edenfield to probation and community service.

In September 2019, Andrew M. Smith, a University of Illinois student, was arrested for placing a noose in a campus elevator. &quot;The incident [came] just months after black employees filed a class-action lawsuit against the campus, alleging they faced racial harassment and were exposed to threats of racial violence, such as nooses, swastikas, KKK garb, racist graffiti, and confederate flags.&quot; He was sentenced to supervision, public service, and a $75 fine.

In November 2022, a noose was found on an Obama Presidential Center construction site.

===Bubba Wallace incident===
In July 2020 a garage assigned to African-American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace had been found to contain a &quot;garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose&quot;. After the discovery, which was made by a crew member for Richard Petty Motorsports at the Alabama racetrack, NASCAR was alerted and contacted the FBI, which sent 15 agents to the track to investigate. After the FBI investigation the authorities said the rope had been hanging there since last fall and thus was not a hate crime targeting Wallace. The agencies said no crime was committed and the evidence did not support federal charges. The actions of NASCAR, especially NASCAR president Steve Phelps&#x27;s claim of it being a hate crime without investigation have been criticized. Holman W. Jenkins Jr. on The Wall Street Journal claimed the controversy and media furor concerning the incident could have been prevented by not contacting the FBI and NASCAR authorities quickly checking the video surveillance by themselves, since NASCAR already tightly controls and surveils access to its garages.

<text>Daemen University is a private university in Amherst and Brooklyn, New York, United States. Formerly Daemen College and Rosary Hill College, the now-nondenominational school was founded by the Sisters of St. Francis in 1947.

As of fall 2020, 2,536 students were enrolled at Daemen (1,631 undergraduate, 905 graduate). 64 degree majors were offered

In March 2022, the New York State Board of Regents approved a name change to Daemen University.

== Main campus ==
Located in Western New York, Daemen&#x27;s main campus is in a suburban setting in Amherst, New York in the Buffalo Niagara Region. Daemen is on Main Street in Amherst and close to the New York State Thruway and I-290 and the Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The Amherst campus contains 19 buildings or complexes with classrooms, laboratories, residential and athletics facilities.

==History==
In 1947, Rosary Hill College was established by the Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity as an institution of higher education for women offering studies in the liberal arts. The institution has admitted men since the mid-1960s and graduated its first male student in 1965. In 1976, Rosary Hill became a secular and independent institution and was renamed Daemen College, in honor of the founder of the Sisters of St. Francis – Mother Magdalene Daemen, of Holland.

In 2015, Daemen opened the Academic Wellness Center after a $5.6 million renovation of the former YMCA building on Main Street in Amherst.

In 2017, to mark its 70th anniversary, Daemen installed Founders Bell, which was forged in 1858 and restored by the Class of 1967. Each year, the bell is the centerpiece of Founders Celebration, an annual tradition to recognize the institution&#x27;s history. 

In 2020, Daemen opened the Center for Interprofessional Learning and Simulation (CILS), which has eight examination rooms, a counseling room and a space for telehealth counseling and is used by students in the university&#x27;s nursing, social work, physical therapy, physician assistant studies and other programs.

<doc id="483678" wikidata="Q5530546" url="?curid=483678" title="GemStone IV">
<text>GemStone IV is a multiplayer text-based online role-playing video game (often known as a MUD) produced by Simutronics. Players control characters in a high fantasy game world named &quot;Elanthia&quot;. The first playable version of the game was known as &quot;GemStone ][&quot; and was launched in April 1988 on GEnie. It was one of the first MMORPGs and is one of the longest running online games still active. Access to the game is subscription-based (monthly fee) through its website, with three additional subscriptions levels available, &quot;Premium&quot;, &quot;Platinum&quot; and &quot;Shattered&quot;, in addition to a free-to-play model introduced in early March 2015.

==Technical information==

&quot;GemStone IV&quot; is a text-based game built on Simutronics&#x27; proprietary engine, the IFE (Interactive Fiction Engine). This engine is capable of changing nearly any aspect of the game on the fly which allows updates without the necessity for downtime. Due to the use of the IFE, &quot;GemStone&quot; is rarely taken offline, giving a 24-hour uptime cycle aside from the occasional game crash.

The &quot;GemStone&quot; interface is simply a text stream, and the game can be played with a Telnet interface after authentication. There are several official interfaces to the game, as well as several unofficial ones. The oldest interface for Windows is called the &quot;Wizard Front End&quot; and offers several useful features such as status readouts, macros, and limited scripting abilities. The Wizard has since been superseded with the &quot;StormFront&quot; Front End introduced in 2003, which itself has been rebranded as &quot;Wrayth&quot; in 2022. Wrayth offers several additional extensions to the game, including a &quot;point and click&quot; interface that allows one to click on text within the game and bring up action menus applicable to that portion of text. The Java FE and a browser-based version named &quot;eScape&quot; are less popular alternatives. A Wizard (similar to the Windows version) also exists for Macintosh Classic, while a Front End named &quot;Avalon&quot; is available for Mac OS X. No official Linux client exists.

==History==
&quot;GemStone&quot; was first demonstrated to GEnie in 1987 before Simutronics was officially incorporated. It was only used as a demonstration model and was never available to the general subscribers. &quot;GemStone ][&quot; was released in April 1988 to GEnie customers. However, &quot;GemStone ][&quot; was very short-lived, and &quot;GemStone III&quot; went into open beta testing in December 1989, officially launching on February 1, 1990. The transition from &quot;][&quot; to &quot;III&quot; maintained significant portions of the environment, but not all, and character records were not maintained over the transition, requiring all players to begin anew. &quot;GemStone III&quot; evolved into &quot;GemStone IV&quot; in November 2003, but the game world and character records were maintained over the transition. &quot;GemStone III&quot; was promoted on GEnie by promising players the opportunity to receive real-life versions of gems found in-game, something that persisted for many years.

&quot;GemStone&quot; originally operated with a license to use the Rolemaster game mechanics and Shadow World environment from Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE). In 1995, Simutronics and ICE agreed to let the business relationship expire, necessitating the removal of all ICE intellectual property from &quot;GemStone&quot;. Many of the game changes were simply renaming ICE names, such as changing the world name from Kulthea to Elanthia, and renaming the deities while keeping their previous characteristics.

Game mechanics were greatly changed with the de-ICEing (as the period is colloquially named), which required every game character to undergo significant changes. Character racial and class choices were also changed, making any direct translation between the two systems difficult. The end result was that every character was required to &quot;re-roll&quot; their character with the option to change race and skills, but maintaining their old experience level, class, and equipment.

&quot;GemStone&quot; became available on AOL in September, 1995, just after the de-ICEing process. It had already become available on CompuServe and Prodigy before that. When AOL switched to flat-rate pricing, &quot;GemStone&quot; did over 1.4 million customer-hours in a single month and was attracting 2,000-2,500 simultaneous players. Simutronics launched a web portal in 1997, and started phasing customers off of the online services and onto the web interface, although it would take several years before the last of the online service portals were closed.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1991 stated that &quot;Gemstone III&quot; was a good example of the best and worst aspects of online play. The reviewer liked the game&#x27;s community aspect and well-written prose, but criticized the poor parser, &quot;surprisingly empty&quot; game environment and—given the per-minute charge—lack of a free tutorial, and concluded that &quot;the present incarnation of on-line games doesn&#x27;t quite work for him&quot;. In a follow-up 1993 review, the reviewer wrote that his sojourn in Kulthea was a rewarding experience. He reported receiving help from both built-in commands and other characters and the ability and opportunity for his bard character to sing. The reviewer concluded that &quot;at last, I know why&quot; the game was so popular. In 1997 &quot;Next Generation&quot; named it as number seven on their &quot;Top 10 Online Game Picks&quot;. At its peak (1996), &quot;GemStone III&quot; had over 2,000 simultaneous users and 1 million play hours per month, large numbers for its era.

In 2020 and 2021, &quot;GemStone III&quot; inspired retrospectives by Elizabeth Landau in Wired and Gizmodo. She noted its ability to facilitate human communication and its similar nature to later MMORPGs and social media.

<text>Sweat equity refers to work one does to build up value without a salary. This ownership interest, or increase in value, is created as a direct result of hard work by the owner. For example, homeowners who renovate or repair their house themselves are investing in sweat equity that increases the value of their home. 
Or it could be a non-monetary benefit that a company&#x27;s stakeholders give in labour and time, rather than a monetary contribution, that benefit the company. 
In some cases, sweat equity may be rewarded in the form of sweat equity shares. These are shares given out by a company in exchange for labour and time rather than a monetary amount.

== Sweat equity in real estate ==

Sweat equity has an application in business real estate, for example, where the owners put in effort and toil to build the business, in real estate where owners can perform D.I.Y. improvements and increase the value of the real estate, and in other areas such as an auto owner putting in their own effort and toil to increase the value of the vehicle.
The term sweat equity explains the fact that value added to someone&#x27;s own house by unpaid work results in measurable market rate value increase in house price. The more labor applied to the home, and the greater the resultant increase in value, the more sweat equity has been used. The concept of sweat equity was first employed in the United States by the American Friends Service Committee in the Penn Craft self-help housing project beginning in 1937. The AFSC began using the term in the 1950s when helping migrant farmers in California to build their own homes. It is perhaps most popularly associated today with a successful model used by Habitat for Humanity, in which families who would otherwise be unable to purchase a home contribute sweat equity hours to the construction of their own home or the homes of other Habitat for Humanity partner families, or by volunteering to assist the organization in other ways. Once living in their new home, the family then make interest-free mortgage payments into a revolving fund which then provides capital to build homes for other families.

== Sweat equity in U.S. private business ==

Private businesses in the U.S. make up 60% of yearly business net income. Recent data has shown the sweat equity in the private business sector equals 1.2 times the U.S. GDP. Theories have been put out to the public to say that lowering income tax rates on private businesses is significantly understated when considering smaller firms&#x27; sweat equity effects.

== Sweat equity shares ==

Sweat equity shares are discounted shares issued by a company to its employees or directors. The shares are given in exchange for a value-add by an employee or director. Sweat equity shares are essential when creating a startup with low amounts of funding.

Sweat equity shares can be used as motivation for the startup&#x27;s employees and will create a more level playing field against large corporations. In a startup company formed as a corporation, employees may receive stock or stock options, becoming part-owners of the firm, in exchange for accepting salaries that are below their respective market values (this includes zero wages). The term used to refer to a form of compensation by businesses to their owners or employees.

The term is sometimes used to describe the efforts put into a start-up company by the founders in exchange for ownership shares of the company. This concept, also called &quot;stock for services&quot; and sometimes &quot;equity compensation&quot; or &quot;sweat equity,&quot; can also be seen when startup companies use their shares of stock to entice service providers to provide necessary corporate services in exchange for a discount or for deferring service fees until a later date; see, e.g., &quot;Idea Makers and Idea Brokers in High Technology Entrepreneurship&quot; by Todd L. Juneau et al., Greenwood Press, 2003, which describes equity for service programs involving patent lawyers and securities lawyers who specialize in start-up companies as clients. The “Slicing Pie” model, outlined in Mike Moyer&#x27;s 2012 book Slicing Pie: Funding Your Company Without Funds, outlines a formula based entirely on sweat equity by observing the relative value of each person&#x27;s unpaid fair market compensation and reimbursement.

<text>Aurich (; East Frisian Low Saxon: &quot;Auerk&quot;, West Frisian: &quot;Auwerk&quot;, ) is a town in the East Frisian region of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Aurich and is the second largest City in East Frisia, both in population, after Emden, and in area, after Wittmund.

==History==

The history of Aurich dates back to the 13th century, when the settlement of &quot;Aurechove&quot; was mentioned in a Frisian document called the &quot;Brokmerbrief&quot; in 1276. There are various hypotheses about the interpretation of the city name. It either refers to a person (Affo, East Frisian first name ) and his property (Reich) or it refers to waterworks on the fertile, water-rich lowland of the Aa (or Ehe) river, upon which the city was built; medieval realizations were Aurichove, Aurike, Aurikehove, Auerk, Auryke, Auwerckhove, Auwerick, Auwerck, Auwreke, Awerck, Awreke, Awrik, Auwerich and Aurickeshove .

In 1517, Count Edzard from the House of Cirksena began rebuilding the town after an attack. In 1539, the land authorities were brought together in Aurich, making it the county capital and, later, East Frisia, remaining the seat of the land authorities when East Frisia was inherited by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1744. After the Prussian Army was defeated in the Battle of Jena in 1807, Aurich became part of the Kingdom of Holland in 1808. In 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was annexed by France and Aurich was made the capital of the department Ems-Oriental of the First French Empire. After Napoleon was defeated in 1814, it passed to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1815, and then was annexed by Prussia in 1866 and made part of the Province of Hanover.

From 21 October 1944, until 23 December 1944, a Nazi concentration camp was established in Aurich. The camp was a subcamp to the Neuengamme concentration camp.

After World War II, Aurich became part of the new state of Lower Saxony.

==Local council==
The local council has 40 members
The elections in September 2016 showed the following results
*SPD: 13 seats
*CDU: 11 seats
*AWG 4 seats
*Gemeinsam für Aurich (GfA), 4 seats
*Alliance 90/The Greens 3 seats
*The Left 2 seats
*Grün-Alternative Politik (GAP)(Green alternative politics) 2 seats
*FDP, 1 seat

==Coat of arms==
Aurich&#x27;s coat of arms is drawn by the blazon: &quot;Arms: Landscape with chief two-thirds sky and base third earth, a shield Gules emblazoned with letter &#x27;A&#x27; Or, an open-topped crown Or above, two growing trees Vert at sides. Crown: A battlement Gules with three merlons and two embrasures. Supporters: Two branches of mistletoe with leaves and berries Or.&quot;.

<doc id="483694" wikidata="Q3194742" url="?curid=483694" title="Keith Hernandez">
<text>Keith Hernandez (born October 20, 1953) is an American former Major League Baseball first baseman who played the majority of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets. Hernandez was a five-time All-Star who shared the 1979 NL MVP award and won two World Series titles, one each with the Cardinals and Mets. Since 1998, he has been a color commentator on Mets television broadcasts.

A contact hitter with a .296 career average and a walk rate of 12.5%, Hernandez&#x27;s career hitting productivity was 31% above league average. For his defensive work, he received 11 consecutive Gold Glove awards, the most by any first baseman in baseball history. Hernandez is widely considered the best defensive first baseman of all time.

Hernandez has been a color commentator on Mets games for SNY, alongside former Mets teammate Ron Darling and play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen since the launch of the network in 2006. He has also been a studio analyst for MLB on Fox since 2017.

==Early life==
Hernandez was born in San Francisco, and grew up in Pacifica and Millbrae, California. He attended Terra Nova High School in Pacifica during his freshman year, then transferred to Capuchino High School in San Bruno for the remainder of his high school years. During a Mets broadcast, Hernandez said he nearly enrolled at Serra High School, a boys&#x27; Catholic high school in San Mateo that graduated Barry Bonds and Tom Brady. Hernandez was a star athlete in high school and graduated in 1971. One of his teammates at Terra Nova High School was future major league pitcher Bob McClure, who had also played Little League baseball with him. Given his surname, and the fact that he is from California, it was incorrectly assumed that Hernandez was of Mexican descent, and he was nicknamed &quot;Mex&quot; by his teammates. In actuality, his father&#x27;s ancestry is Castilian Spanish and his mother is Scots-Irish, as he explained during a Mets broadcast on SNY.

Hernandez was perceived as having attitude issues because he sat out his entire senior high school season due to a dispute with a coach. He played briefly at the College of San Mateo, a local community college, before being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 42nd round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft as the 783rd player selected. Hernandez was the last player selected and signed in the 1971 Major League Baseball draft to play in the Major Leagues. He batted and threw left-handed, and through most of his career was listed as being 6&#x27; tall (1.83m) and 195 lbs. (88.5 kg).

During his childhood, Hernandez&#x27;s brother bought a book on Civil War history, which ignited Hernandez&#x27;s passion for the subject. His interest in the Civil War landed Hernandez guest spots on KMOX radio when he was with the Cardinals, was featured in the &quot;New York Times&quot; when he was with the Mets, and appeared in episodes of the television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

==Baseball career==
===St. Louis Cardinals===

Hernandez&#x27;s batting average hovered around .250 for most of his minor league career, until his promotion to the Tulsa Oilers in the second half of the 1973 season. With the Cardinals&#x27; AAA affiliate, Hernandez batted .333 with five home runs and a .525 slugging percentage. The following season, Hernandez&#x27;s average jumped to .351, earning him a promotion to the big league club. He made his major league debut at Candlestick Park on August 30, 1974, against the San Francisco Giants, going 1-for-2 with two walks, and earning his first major league RBI with a single in the ninth. Following the season, the Cards traded first baseman Joe Torre to the New York Mets for Tommy Moore and Ray Sadecki to make room for their budding young prospect.

Hernandez ended up splitting 1975 between Tulsa and the Cardinals. Though he had a .996 fielding percentage with only two errors in 507 chances, Hernandez struggled with major league pitching, batting only .250 with three home runs and 20 RBIs.

Hernandez wore uniform number 18 for the first two years of his career. In 1976, he switched to number 37, insisting that his uniform number end with a &quot;7&quot; in honor of Mickey Mantle (with whom he shared a birthday). While Hernandez became more comfortable with his bat, he was always recognized as a fielder first, snatching his first Gold Glove Award away from perennial winner Steve Garvey in 1978. In 1979, however, Hernandez&#x27;s batting improved markedly as he led the league with a .344 batting average, 48 doubles, and 116 runs scored, and went on to share the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award with Willie Stargell. For the first and only time in major league history, two players received the same number of points from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America and shared the MVP award for that year.

From there, Hernandez became a perennial .300 hitter, and one of the top stars in the National League. His Cardinals won the 1982 World Series, defeating the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games. In game six, Hernandez and Cardinal catcher Darrell Porter hit home runs in a 13–1 St. Louis victory. Hernandez also contributed eight runs batted in during the seven-game World Series.

After multiple disagreements with Cardinals management, most notably manager Whitey Herzog, Hernandez was traded to the Mets on June 15, 1983, for pitchers Neil Allen and Rick Ownbey. Herzog said he felt that Hernandez had become a cancer on his team and never regretted the trade.

Hernandez, after the trade, said that he believed his cocaine use while playing for the team was the impetus for the trade and that he even played a game while under its influence (although he couldn&#x27;t remember which game). Hernandez testified that in 1980 perhaps 40 percent of MLB players were using the drug but that use dramatically declined after that season. He said he did not use cocaine after being traded to the Mets.

===New York Mets===

The Mets had retired number 37 for former manager Casey Stengel, so Hernandez switched to number 17 upon joining the club, which he wore for the remainder of his career. As a result of this trade, Hernandez went from a World Series champion to a team that narrowly avoided a hundred losses (68–94) and consistently finished at the bottom of the National League East. Hernandez, however, was determined to prove Herzog wrong, helping to fuel a rivalry between the two teams in the mid-1980s.

Under new manager Davey Johnson, the 1984 Mets had their first winning season since 1976, finishing 90–72, and six games ahead of the Cardinals in the NL East (6.5 games behind the eventual division winner, the Chicago Cubs). Hernandez finished second in the NL Most Valuable Player voting behind Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, and emerged as the leader of the Mets&#x27; young core of ballplayers that included 1983 and 1984 Rookies of the Year Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden, respectively.

Hernandez had such a strong and accurate throwing arm that, as a result, the Mets re-routed their relays through him. Due to his quick instincts, Hernandez was also able to play farther off first base than other first basemen, allowing the other infielders to play farther to their right.

Hernandez is widely considered one of the greatest fielding first basemen in major league history. He made brilliant diving plays far to his right and left. 
Hernandez defended bunts by charging so aggressively that he occasionally discouraged opponents from attempting to bunt merely by reputation. Pete Rose, when he managed the Cincinnati Reds, compared bunting against Hernandez to &quot;driving the lane against Bill Russell.&quot; Astros manager Hal Lanier said the combination of Hernandez at first and any one of three Mets pitchers— Ron Darling, Roger McDowell or Jesse Orosco— made bunting against the Mets &quot;near impossible&quot;, and Cubs manager Jim Frey said he wouldn&#x27;t ask most pitchers to bunt against the Mets. &quot;You&#x27;re just asking for a forceout at second, and now you&#x27;ve got your pitcher running the bases&quot;, he said. It wasn&#x27;t just that Hernandez would arrive in front of the home-plate a moment after the pitch did. He had an uncanny feel for when the batter would attempt to bunt, therefore knowing when to charge in the first place. In the decades since Hernandez intimidated the opposition on bunt plays, no first baseman has yet managed to copy the move, with the possible exception of Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs three decades later.

Hernandez also was adept at picking runners off first base by taking pickoff throws with his right foot on the bag and his left in foul territory so that he could make tags to his right more readily. As a result, umpires began to more strongly enforce the defensive positioning rule which states that all defensive players except the catcher must be positioned in fair territory while the ball is pitched.
In 1985, Hernandez&#x27;s previous cocaine use (and distribution of the drug to other players), which had been the subject of persistent rumors and the chief source of friction between Hernandez and Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog, became a matter of public record as a result of the Pittsburgh trial of drug dealer Curtis Strong. MLB Commissioner Peter Ueberroth found that Hernandez was among seven players who had used cocaine and been involved in its distribution. The players received season-long suspensions, that were commuted on condition that they donated ten percent of their base salaries to drug-abuse programs, submitted to random drug testing, and contributed 100 hours of drug-related community service. Hernandez has always maintained that his cocaine use was recreational and limited to a time when baseball players routinely used the drug and has adamantly denied he ever distributed the drug. Initially, Hernandez considered challenging Ueberroth&#x27;s finding against him, but ultimately accepted the option available, which allowed him to avoid missing any playing time. Part of his reasoning was that he expected the Mets to make a World Series run in 1986.

Well before the commissioner&#x27;s decision, the Mets and Cardinals had become embroiled in a heated rivalry atop the National League East, with Hernandez, newly acquired All-star catcher Gary Carter, and other talented veterans combining with a spectacular group of young talent to lead the charge for the Mets. The 1985 season came down to the wire as the Mets won 98 games, narrowly losing the division to a Cardinals team that won 101 games. The Mets had three players finish in the top ten in NL MVP balloting that season (Gooden 4th, Carter 6th, and Hernandez 8th). Meanwhile, the &quot;Redbirds&quot; placed four players in the top ten: winner Willie McGee), (Tommy Herr 5th, John Tudor tied Hernandez at 8th, Jack Clark 10th, and had the 11th-place finisher (Vince Coleman).

Hernandez set a record for game-winning RBIs in 1985 with 24, a statistic that was only official from 1980 to 1988 (the previous record was 22 by the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Harold Baines in 1983). His career total is 129, which is also a record.

Hernandez credits his father, who played ball with Stan Musial when they were both in the Navy during World War II, for helping him out of a batting slump in 1985. His father would observe his at-bats on TV and note that when Keith was hitting well, he could see both the &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;7&quot; on his uniform on his back as he began to stride into the pitch. Not seeing both numbers meant Keith was bailing out on inside pitches, trying too hard to pull the ball, and vulnerable to outside fastballs or outside breaking pitches.

====1986 World Series Champions====

The 1986 Mets won 108 games and took the National League East by 21.5 games over the Philadelphia Phillies. Hernandez hit .310 with 83 RBI. The Mets won the 1986 World Series in seven games over the Boston Red Sox. Hernandez batted only .231, and recorded the second out in the now legendary tenth inning of Game 6, lining out to the deep center field. In Game 7, Hernandez broke through against Red Sox lefty Bruce Hurst, who had shut out the Mets into the sixth inning, with a clutch two-run single. He also drove in another important run his next time up, giving him 3 RBI for the game. Carter and Hernandez finished third and fourth, respectively, in NL MVP balloting.

====Team captain====
Given his drug suspension deal and the team’s &quot;party hard; play harder&quot; culture, Hernandez became seen by some as the poster-boy for the Mets of the &#x27;80s. In 1987, Davey Johnson named Hernandez the first team captain in franchise history. A season later, Carter was named co-captain.

In 1988 he was featured heavily in the William Goldman 
and Mike Lupica
book &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, which looked at life inside the Mets over the whole 1987 season (among other New York sports teams). Hernandez is portrayed as the most vocal of the Mets in dealing with the press and giving his opinion on teammates, alongside his prodigious beer consumption.

In 1988, Hernandez won his 11th and final Gold Glove and led his team to another division crown. The heavily favored Mets, however, lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series. Both Hernandez and Carter were in the twilights of their careers as back, knee, and hamstring problems limited Hernandez to only 95 games. Carter, meanwhile, batted .242 for the season and famously struggled to hit his 300th career home run.

Hernandez&#x27;s batting average fell to .233 in only 75 games for the 1989 Mets. The Mets chose not to re-sign him after his contract ran out at the close of the 1989 season, and on November 13, he was granted free agency. A day later, the Mets released Carter.

===Cleveland Indians===
Hernandez signed with the Cleveland Indians for the 1990 season. He was injured much of the time, and appeared in only 43 games, batting .200 with one home run and eight RBIs. He retired at the end of the season.

===Retirement===

Hernandez has published five books; &quot;If at First: A Season With the Mets&quot; (his diary of the 1985 New York Mets season), &quot;Pure Baseball: Pitch by Pitch for the Advanced Fan&quot; (a detailed player&#x27;s look into baseball strategy), &quot;Shea Good-Bye: The Untold Inside Story of the Historic 2008 Season&quot;, and &quot;Murder at Shea: A Baseball Murder Mystery for Kids&quot; (a young-adult novel about a fictional Met solving a murder). His most recent book, &quot;I&#x27;m Keith Hernandez&quot;, was released on May 15, 2018. The book covers his life through early in the 1980 season, and, depending on sales, may lead to a follow-up tome picking up the narrative from that point.

On September 27, 2012, Hernandez had his familiar mustache shaved off for charity.

===Legacy===

Hernandez batted over .300 seven times in his career and led the National League in runs scored (1979 and 1980), batting average (1979), doubles (1979), on-base percentage (1980), and walks (1986) during his career. He also won 11 Gold Glove awards for his glovework at first base, setting a Major League record for the position that still stands. Hernandez shared an MVP award and played on two World Series champions, for one of whom he was the co-captain. He is the all-time game-winning RBI leader, and in 1985 set the single-season record for this stat as well (this statistic was kept between 1980 and 1988). However, he never received enough support from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2004, after nine years on the ballot, Hernandez received votes from fewer than 5% of the writers, thus ending his eligibility. Hernandez has been eligible for consideration for induction by the Veterans Committee since 2011 (20 years after his retirement) but has yet to be inducted. First base is the only position to have a player with 10 or more Gold Gloves who is either not in the Hall of Fame, currently on the BBWAA ballot, or not yet eligible.

Hernandez was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1997 and was voted the Mets&#x27; all-time first baseman by fans in celebration of the team&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2002. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Mets, Hernandez was selected as the Mets&#x27; all-time first baseman by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters that included Marty Noble, Mike Lupica, Gary Cohen and Howie Rose among others. In the event held on June 17, 2012, Hernandez recalled how he was, at first, upset by the trade to New York but soon acknowledged it as a refreshing change and said it &quot;reenergized&quot; him because of the &quot;young talent, young guys were hungry&quot;.

In 2021, Hernandez was elected to the Cardinals&#x27; Hall of Fame. An official induction ceremony was held on August 21, 2021. On July 9, 2022, the New York Mets retired his number 17.

==Acting==
Hernandez guest-starred as himself in &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, a two-part 1992 episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In the episode, Hernandez dates Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s character Elaine Benes, and Jerry Seinfeld develops the male-bonding equivalent of a crush on him. A subplot of the episode is a parody of the movie &quot;JFK&quot; and the &quot;Magic Bullet Theory&quot; featured in it. According to the show, on June 14, 1987, the Mets were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea Stadium, and Hernandez committed an error in the ninth inning, allowing the Phillies to score five runs and costing the Mets the game (in reality, the Mets defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates on the road on that date; Hernandez played, but did not commit an error). Hernandez exited the players&#x27; gate, where Kramer and Newman were waiting, and Newman heckled Hernandez. Kramer and Newman then spent the next five years claiming that Hernandez had spat on them, when in fact it was Roger McDowell.

Hernandez appeared with Mookie Wilson in an episode of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1988. In the episode, the pair try to teach Mr. Snuffleupagus to play baseball. The two also appeared in the song &quot;Put Down the Duckie.&quot;

Hernandez also appeared in the final episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which aired in 1998. Hernandez makes about $3,000 a year in royalties from the show as of 2015. ESPN columnist Bill Simmons coined the phrase &quot;having a Keith Hernandez Moment&quot; about the point in Hernandez&#x27;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot; appearance where he recovers from a moment of self-doubt by simply reminding himself: &quot;I&#x27;m Keith Hernandez!&quot; The &quot;I&#x27;m Keith Hernandez&quot; quote became the title of Hernandez&#x27;s fifth book two decades after the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode aired.

Hernandez also appeared in a 1994 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; entitled &quot;Wager&quot;, and in the movies &quot;The Scout&quot; and &quot;The Yards&quot;.

He also made an appearance in a 1993 episode of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; entitled &quot;Building Bridges&quot;.

===Commercial appearances===
Hernandez and Walt Frazier have appeared in several television commercials for Just for Men, a men&#x27;s hair-coloring product.

Hernandez has appeared in television commercials for the Coin Galleries of Oyster Bay, a coin dealer with several locations on Long Island, New York. In the ads, he says that Coin Galleries is &quot;where you can turn your pot of gold into cash.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==

Hernandez, alongside Gary Cohen and Ron Darling, is now a baseball commentator serving as an analyst for Mets&#x27; television broadcasts on SNY and WPIX (WPIX games are produced by SNY). He&#x27;s become known for wry humor and ironic commentary, as well as blunt outspokenness, on the mic. A television advertisement for SNY Sports referred to Hernandez&#x27;s mustache by imagining a celebration known as &quot;Keith Hernandez Day&quot; at which all attendees are required to wear authentic Keith Hernandez mustaches. One sports fan, who refuses to respect the day by wearing a mustache, is met by the steely, disapproving stare of Hernandez himself. Hernandez admitted that he never wore eyeblack while playing because he had high cheekbones. In 2007 Hernandez won the &quot;Mustache Madness&quot; contest on newsday.com, and the American Mustache Institute chose his facial hair as the &quot;top sports mustache ever&quot;. Baseball-Reference.com ranks Hernandez&#x27;s mustache as the fourth-best in history.

On April 22, 2006, Hernandez created a controversy during the broadcast of a game against the San Diego Padres. After witnessing Padres team massage therapist Kelly Calabrese giving San Diego catcher Mike Piazza a high five in the dugout after he hit a home run, Hernandez said, &quot;Who is the girl in the dugout, with the long hair? What&#x27;s going on here? You have got to be kidding me. Only player personnel in the dugout.&quot; After Hernandez was informed later in the broadcast that Calabrese was a club employee, he maintained his position, stating, &quot;I won&#x27;t say that women belong in the kitchen, but they don&#x27;t belong in the dugout.&quot; After the game, San Diego manager Bruce Bochy expressed displeasure with Hernandez&#x27;s comments. Hernandez apologized and alluded to his words being nothing more than tomfoolery by saying, &quot;You know I am only teasing. I love you gals out there — always have.&quot;

Hernandez, along with Cohen and Darling, had a website, www.pitchinforagoodcause.org where the net profit from the merchandise sold by the website goes to the Cobble Hill Health Center, Juvenile Diabetes Research Center, and The Danbury Women&#x27;s Center. Hernandez is also a strong supporter of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, New York City Chapter. His mother, Jacqueline Hernandez, suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s for nine years before dying in 1989.

Hernandez won two 2010 New York Emmys. He won an individual award for Sports Analyst and as part of the SNY Mets broadcast team which won the &quot;Live Sports Event: Series 2009 Mets: The Inaugural Year of Citi Field&quot; award.

Hernandez joined the MLB on Fox broadcast team as a studio analyst for the 2017 MLB postseason.

== Politics ==
Hernandez said on a Fox Business appearance in June 2019 that he is a fan of President Donald Trump because the president had &quot;helped everybody&quot; in regards to the economy. &quot;I think the people have gone to work of all different races and creeds and colors – unemployment is down everywhere,&quot; he said.

Hernandez has donated thousands of dollars to GOP candidates, including Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Susan Collins, Rudy Giuliani, Allen West, David Perdue, and Kelly Loeffler.

On November 19, 2021, Hernandez tweeted a photograph of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#x27;s anti-vaccine book &quot;The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health&quot; with the caption &quot;Just released.&quot; The tweet was roundly criticized by users, prompting Hernandez to delete it.

== Personal life ==
Hernandez is the son of John Hernandez (1922–1992), a minor league first baseman affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Yankees in the 1940s. His older brother, Gary, played college baseball at Cal and four seasons of minor league baseball.

Hernandez married Sue Broecker in 1979 and the couple had three daughters; they divorced in 1983. He married Kai Thompson in 2005; they divorced in February 2011.

<text>Normanton is an inner city suburb and ward of the city of Derby in Derbyshire, England, situated approximately south of the city centre. Neighbouring suburbs include Littleover, Pear Tree, Rose Hill and Sunny Hill. The original village of Normanton-by-Derby, which now forms the southern part of the suburb, dates back to the medieval period. As the Normanton area became rapidly urbanised in the 19th century, the New Normanton area to the north was developed for housing, linking the old village to Derby, into which it was eventually absorbed. The area is characterised by high density late 19th century terraced housing in New Normanton and mid-20th century housing estates elsewhere, and has the most ethnically diverse population in Derby. The Normanton ward had a population of 17,071 in 2011.

==History==
 The modern suburb grew from an ancient village, formerly known as Normanton-by-Derby. The area is thought to have been the site of one of the major Viking settlements in the Derby area, hence the original name, Normanestune, which means &quot;Norseman&#x27;s settlement&quot;. Normanestune is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book, once recording the lands of the King and again for land belonging to Henry de Ferrers when it was valued at ten shillings.

The location of the original village lies just south of the modern ring road, its main thoroughfare commemorated by the present day Village Street. St Giles&#x27; Parish Church stands on Village Street, atop a slight hill, and its spire can be seen across most of the district. In the 1740s the Dixie family had Normanton Hall built; this was later used as a school building in the 20th century.

The portion of the district to the north of the ring road is called New Normanton. The area began to urbanise rapidly in the mid 19th century, Normanton eventually being absorbed by the expansion of Derby&#x27;s boundaries up to the 1930s. Much of the housing stock in the area is typical Victorian brick terracing.

==Government==
Normanton is one of the seventeen wards which make up Derby, and as such elects three councillors to Derby City Council. Some parts of Normanton fall outside the ward boundaries; for example Normanton Road and much of New Normanton are in the Arboretum ward, while the area around Carlton Road is in Abbey ward. The ward forms part of the Derby South constituency of the United Kingdom parliament.

Normanton was formerly a civil parish within Shardlow Rural District. In 1921 the parish had a population of 1383. The New Normanton part of the parish (roughly the area north of the modern inner ring road) was annexed by the town in 1901. On 28 March 1928 the parish was abolished most of the parish becoming part of Derby, with some areas transferring to the adjacent parishes of Littleover and Sinfin Moor, it became part of the county borough of Derby.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census, the Normanton ward had a population of 17,071. This was a 26.4% increase on the 2001 Census figure of 13,506.

The area has a high ethnic minority population, with the largest concentration of Derby&#x27;s British Asian community. In 2011, 67% of the population was estimated to be non-White British, compared to a figure of 25% for the whole of Derby. Around 43% of the ward population is from an Asian background, with the largest minority community being British Pakistanis at 27% of the total population. The neighbouring Arboretum ward, which includes parts of Normanton, has very similar figures, and is also 67% non-White British, including 41% of Asian origin, of which 31% are Pakistani British. The area has also had a large influx of eastern europeans settle in the area.

==Religion==

Normanton has a wide number of places of worship, including the Guru Arjan Dev Gurdwara on Stanhope Street, the Singh Sabha Gurdwara on Prince&#x27;s Street, the Ramgarhia Gurdwara on St. James&#x27;s Street and the Guru Ravidass Gurdwara on Duncan Road. There are also many mosques in Normanton such as Masjid Assalaam on Pear Tree Road, Masjid Ahl-e-Hadith on Hastings Street, Masjid-e-Khulafa-e-Rashedeen on Cameron Road, Derby Jamia Mosque on Rosehill Street and Dairy House Road, and Masjid Al-Farooq on Mill Hill Lane. There is also a Hindu temple on Pear Tree Road. 
There are various Christian churches meeting in the area, from mainstream Anglican and Roman Catholic congregations to free churches and newer house churches. There is a Polish church off St Chad&#x27;s Road, a Ukrainian church off Dairy House Road, and a Serbian church off Dale Road.

The local Sikh community organise an annual Vaisakhi parade around Normanton from the gurdwara. The 2012 event attracted between ten and fifteen thousand people.

==Landmarks== 
A prominent local landmark was once the Normanton Barracks, headquarters of the Sherwood Foresters regiment. The perimeter of the Barracks comprised an imposing and substantial 4-metre high red brick wall with the barrack&#x27;s internal buildings only just visible from atop a double decker 88 Sinfin to Derby bus. Most of the wall, and many buildings, remained when the site was quit by the army and became a small industrial estate in the mid 1960s. It was all, however, demolished in 1981, and the site is now the Foresters Leisure Park, including the Showcase cinema, some fast food restaurants, a bingo hall, and a bowling alley. At the north west corner of the original Barracks site is now the Oast House pub, a distinctive modern building which is, as the name suggests, in the style of a traditional English oast house a type of structure totally incongruous to this part of the country. Just along the ring road on Village Street is the church that served the Garrison, St Giles&#x27;, where there are numerous memorials to the Sherwood Foresters.
For quite some time after the MOD left the Barracks and before the site was developed the premises were used by a variety of small businesses including small engineering firms, repair, and vehicle spray shops along with storage facilities. The parade ground remained a revered focal point during that time.

A former landmark in the Normanton area was the church on St Chad&#x27;s Road; however, this was demolished in the mid-1990s and the area is now used as a playing field for children attending St Chad&#x27;s School. There is now a &#x27;Faith Centre&#x27; next to the playing field.

==Community facilities==

The area&#x27;s main public recreational facility is Normanton Park; it was opened in 1909, as recorded on the café clock tower. The park links the old village of Normanton and the modern New Normanton area. Facilities include a children&#x27;s play area and a community building. Sunny Hill Recreation Ground and Sherwood Recreation Ground are also situated in Normanton ward. Other parks located outside the ward, but serving the Normanton area, include Derby Arboretum in Rose Hill and Sunnydale Park in Littleover.

==Education==
Three primary schools are located in the Normanton ward: Dale Community Primary, Hardwick Primary and Village Primary. Other nearby primary schools whose catchment areas cover parts of Normanton include Arboretum, Pear Tree, St. Chad&#x27;s and St. James&#x27;. There are no secondary schools within the area, which is covered by the catchment areas for the Bemrose School, the City of Derby Academy, Derby Moor Community Sports College and Littleover Community School.

==Sport==
The Derbyshire Tennis Centre is adjacent to Normanton Park.

The Baseball Ground was built in the northern part of Normanton in 1890, first being the home of Derby Baseball Club until they were disbanded in 1898. It remained open for the next 105 years, however, as Derby County Football Club had played football matches there since 1895 and despite the relocation of the first team to the new Pride Park Stadium in 1997, it remained in use until May 2003 for the club&#x27;s reserve and youth sides. The stadium was demolished that autumn and the site has since been redeveloped for housing.

==Notable people==
Politician Albert Stanley was born in New Normanton in 1874. His family emigrated to the United States in 1880, but he later returned to the United Kingdom, becoming a member of parliament, cabinet minister and Chair of London Underground. Research Scientist and Member of Parliament Ashok Kumar was born in India, moving to Normanton as a child, where he lived on Silver Hill Road.

Footballer Tony Hateley grew up in the area, attending Normanton Junior School and playing for local team Normanton Sports before going on to a professional career with Notts County, Aston Villa and others.

<text>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) was a collaboration between telecommunications associations to make a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone system specification within the scope of the ITU&#x27;s IMT-2000 project. In practice, 3GPP2 was the standardization group for CDMA2000, the set of 3G standards based on the earlier cdmaOne 2G CDMA technology.

The participating associations were ARIB/TTC (Japan), China Communications Standards Association, Telecommunications Industry Association (North America) and Telecommunications Technology Association (South Korea).

The agreement was established in December 1998.

Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) was a 3GPP2 project to develop a fourth-generation successor to CDMA2000. In November 2008, Qualcomm, UMB&#x27;s lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring LTE instead.

3GPP2 should not be confused with 3GPP; 3GPP is the standard body behind the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) that is the 3G upgrade to [[GSM]] networks, while 3GPP2 was the standard body behind the competing 3G standard CDMA2000 that is the 3G upgrade to [[cdmaOne]] networks that was used mostly in the United States (and to some extent also in Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and India).

GSM/UMTS were the most widespread 2G/3G wireless standards worldwide. Most countries used only the GSM family. A few countries, including China, the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Trinidad and Tobago, India, South Korea and Japan, used both standards.

3GPP2 had its last activity in 2013, and the group has been dormant ever since. The 3GPP2 website was taken offline in 2023, primarily due to CDMA carriers deploying 3GPP&#x27;s LTE instead of UMB the decade prior and later shutting down CDMA networks making the 3GPP2 redundant and unneeded. However, as of 2024 the 3GPP2 website has since come back online.

<text>In mathematics, the Fibonacci polynomials are a polynomial sequence which can be considered as a generalization of the Fibonacci numbers. The polynomials generated in a similar way from the Lucas numbers are called Lucas polynomials.

==Definition==
These Fibonacci polynomials are defined by a recurrence relation:

:formula_1

The Lucas polynomials use the same recurrence with different starting values:

:formula_2

They can be defined for negative indices by
:formula_3
:formula_4

The Fibonacci polynomials form a sequence of orthogonal polynomials with formula_5 and formula_6.

== Examples ==
The first few Fibonacci polynomials are:
:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13

The first few Lucas polynomials are:
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20

== Properties ==
* The degree of &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot; − 1 and the degree of &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;. 

* The Fibonacci and Lucas numbers are recovered by evaluating the polynomials at &quot;x&quot; = 1; Pell numbers are recovered by evaluating &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; at &quot;x&quot; = 2. 

* The ordinary generating functions for the sequences are:
*:formula_21
*:formula_22

*The polynomials can be expressed in terms of Lucas sequences as 
*:formula_23
*:formula_24

*They can also be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials formula_25 and formula_26 as
*:formula_27
*:formula_28
:where formula_29 is the imaginary unit.

==Identities==

As particular cases of Lucas sequences, Fibonacci polynomials satisfy a number of identities, such as
:formula_30
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33
Closed form expressions, similar to Binet&#x27;s formula are:
:formula_34
where 
:formula_35
are the solutions (in &quot;t&quot;) of
:formula_36
For Lucas Polynomials &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, we have
:formula_37

A relationship between the Fibonacci polynomials and the standard basis polynomials is given by
:formula_38
For example,
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

==Combinatorial interpretation==

If &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is the coefficient of &quot;xk&quot; in &quot;Fn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), namely 
:formula_43
then &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is the number of ways an &quot;n&quot;−1 by 1 rectangle can be tiled with 2 by 1 dominoes and 1 by 1 squares so that exactly &quot;k&quot; squares are used. Equivalently, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is the number of ways of writing &quot;n&quot;−1 as an ordered sum involving only 1 and 2, so that 1 is used exactly &quot;k&quot; times. For example F(6,3)=4 and 5 can be written in 4 ways, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, as a sum involving only 1 and 2 with 1 used 3 times. By counting the number of times 1 and 2 are both used in such a sum, it is evident that 
formula_44

This gives a way of reading the coefficients from Pascal&#x27;s triangle as shown on the right.

<text>USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (SSN-773), the final , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Cheyenne, Wyoming. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 28 November 1989 and her keel was laid down on 6 July 1992. She was launched on 16 April 1995 sponsored by Mrs. Ann Simpson, wife of Wyoming Senator Alan K. Simpson, and commissioned on 13 September 1996, with Commander Peter H. Ozimik in command. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; transferred to her homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 1998.

&quot;Cheyenne&quot; served as a trials platform for flat-screen, interoperative sonar displays based on commercially available equipment.

&quot;Cheyenne&quot; was the first ship to launch Tomahawk missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom under the command of CDR Charles Doty. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; would go on to successfully launch her entire complement of Tomahawks, earning a &quot;clean sweep&quot; for combat actions in the final three months of a nine-month deployment. This dubbed her &quot;First To Strike&quot;. Her motto is &quot;Ride the Legend&quot;.

USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was the final &quot;Los Angeles&quot;–class submarine built. Following the construction of USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, Newport News began preparation for construction of the .

==History==
Between 25 and 27 March 2006, a series of anti-submarine warfare exercises were held in Hawaiian waters that included USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot;; Carrier Strike Group Nine, the nuclear-powered attack submarines , , , and , as well as land-based P-3 Orion aircraft from patrol squadrons VP-4, VP-9, and VP-47.

In June 2021, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; shifted her homeport from Pearl Harbor to Groton, CT, joining Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) 12. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; moved to Naval Submarine Base New London in order to prepare for upcoming refueling and maintenance intended to extend the service life of the submarine by 10 years. 
&quot;Cheyenne&quot; arrived in November 2021 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine to begin a service-life extension program (SLEP) expected to take 30 months and cost $315 million. In December 2021, Submarine Squadron 2 was re-established at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was transferred to this new command. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is the first of seven Los Angeles-class subs to undergo this SLEP and was also the first vessel in April 2022 to dock in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard&#x27;s newly improved Dry Dock 1 using the Super Flood Basin.

== In popular culture==
*&quot;Cheyenne&quot; is the primary subject of the book &quot;SSN&quot; by Tom Clancy, battling the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy in a fictional war over the Spratly Islands. She is also featured in the video game by Tom Clancy called &quot;SSN&quot;.
*In the 2000 novel &quot;Quicksilver&quot; by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was ordered to fire a Tomahawk TLAM Block Four cruise missile, under manual control of Weapons Officer Lt. Miken Marano, at the River Entrance of the Pentagon.
*In &quot;To the Death&quot; by Patrick Robinson, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; is tasked with shadowing an Iranian Kilo on a path through the Mediterranean Sea.

<text>Events from the year 1834 in Canada.

==Incumbents==
*Monarch: William IV

===Federal government===
*Parliament of Lower Canada: 14th (until October 9)
*Parliament of Upper Canada: 11th (until March 6)

===Governors===
*Governor of the Canadas: Robert Milnes
*Governor of New Brunswick: George Stracey Smyth
*Governor of Nova Scotia: John Coape Sherbrooke
*Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland: Richard Goodwin Keats
*Governor of Prince Edward Island: Charles Douglass Smith

==Events==

===January to June===
*January – King William IV appoints an arbitrator to settle questions regarding customs dues between the Canadas.
*January – The King announces that he will not make the Legislative Council an elected body, as it would be inconsistent with the monarchy, but that he will favor measures for the Council&#x27;s independence.
*January – Thomas Spring Rice, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies writes &quot;If coming events should constrain the British Legislature to interpose its supreme authority to appease the internal dissensions of the Colony, it would then, indeed, become my duty to submit for the consideration of Parliament, some modifications of the charters of the Canadas, not however, for introducing institutions inconsistent with monarchy, but to preserve and cement their connection with the Mother Country, adhering ever to the spirit of the British Constitution, and confining within their legitimate bounds the rights and privileges of His Majesty&#x27;s subjects.&quot;
*January 23 – The Chateau St. Louis (Quebec) is burned.
*February 17 – The Ninety-Two Resolutions are passed by the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. The complaints relate, chiefly, to nominations of Councillors, partiality in filling offices, of which 47 are alleged to have been distributed among 525,000 Frenchmen, against 157 higher positions, among 75,000 of British origin.
**Speaking in the House upon the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which he frames and Mr. Bedard moves, Louis-Joseph Papineau says &quot;It is certain that, before long, the whole of America will be republicanized. If a change be necessary in our present constitution, it is to be undertaken in view of such a conjuncture as I have just mentioned. Would it be a crime, were I to demand that it should? The members of the House are all answerable to their constituents for whatever decisions they may come to, in this regard. And, even though the soldiery should slaughter them for it, they ought not to hesitate, for one moment, to pronounce for any change which they consider beneficial to their country.&quot;
**Mr. Neilson replies: &quot;The American revolutionists and the British Liberals contended for the maintenance of franchises already acquired; we oppositionists are reaching out our hands for freedom which we never possessed. The Resolutions can not be justified, for they favor the refusal of supplies, without which there would be no means of defraying the expense of governing the Province.&quot;
*March 6 – Incorporation of Toronto, heretofore York, Upper Canada.
*William Lyon Mackenzie elected first mayor of the city of Toronto.
*March 8 – The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, an institution in Quebec dedicated to the protection of Quebec francophone interests and to the promotion of Quebec Sovereignism, is founded.

===July to December===
*July 31 – At midnight July 31, slavery comes to an end in all British territories, including British North America. To honour this important event, August 1 is celebrated as Emancipation Day in Windsor, Ontario, and elsewhere.
*December 9 – Foundation of the &quot;Canadian Alliance Society&quot; in Upper Canada at Toronto.
*Before a committee of the British Commons, Hon. Edward Ellice suggests remedies for troubles in Canada.

===Full date unknown===
*A majority of the Assembly call for Lord Aylmer&#x27;s impeachment for maladministration, and invite Daniel O&#x27;Connell and others to assist them. The Council and British Canadians counter-petition. The Assembly omit voting supplies.
*Adopting revolutionary tactics, Papineau advises wearing homespun cloth and buying nothing British, in order to diminish misused revenues. Bankstocks being of British ownership, he advises a general demand of gold for banknotes.
