<text>The slender glass lizard (Ophisaurus attenuatus) is a legless lizard in the glass lizard subfamily (Anguinae). The species is endemic to the United States. Two subspecies are recognized. The lizard was originally believed to be a subspecies of the eastern glass lizard (&quot;Ophisaurus ventralis&quot;). Their name comes from their easily broken tail which they can break off themselves without ever being touched. It is difficult to find a specimen with an undamaged tail. The lizard eats a variety of insects and small animals, including smaller lizards. Snakes and other animals are known to prey on the species. Humans have a part in destroying their environment and killing their food supply with insecticides. The lizard is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it is vulnerable in Iowa and endangered in Wisconsin. The streamlined, legless species is often confused with snakes. Glass Lizards, however, differ from snakes as they possess a moveable eyelid, which is absent in snakes. Another way to distinguish glass lizards from snakes is the presence of an external ear opening, which are absent in snakes. 

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally believed by American herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope to be a subspecies of &quot;Ophisaurus ventralis&quot; in 1880 under the name &quot;Opheosaurus ventralis attenuatus&quot;. It was not until 1885 when the British herpetologist George Albert Boulenger recognized it to be its own species. However, Cope&#x27;s belief influenced other herpetologists until 1949 when another American herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill expressed his belief that Boulenger was correct about it being a distinct species. The difference between this species with &quot;O. ventralis&quot; and other species in the genus is that the white spots on its dorsum are located on the posterior edges of its scales, with none of the spots being located mainly in middle of its scales. Another distinctive difference is that this species has 98 or more scales along its lateral fold. In the word &quot;Ophisaurus&quot;, &quot;orphis&quot; is Ancient Greek for serpent or reptile and &quot;saurus&quot; means lizard or reptile. The word &quot;attenuatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;tapered, drawn out, thin&quot;.

===Subspecies===
*Western slender glass lizard, &quot;O. a. attenuatus&quot; 

The western slender glass lizard reaches an average of . It can be found in woods or dry rocky hillsides, in grass or the burrows of small mammals. The species can easily camouflage itself in tall grass because of its color.

*Eastern slender glass lizard, &quot;O. a. longicaudus&quot; 

The males are larger than females with a longer head and tail. Males have more scales above their lateral fold and along the center of their back than females. Larger males have waxy white crossbars on their dorsum&#x27;s anterior, which have an outline of black and are not present in smaller males and females.

==Description==

Slender glass lizards have yellow to brown bodies with six stripes and they have a middorsal stripe. White specks on the middle of the lizard&#x27;s scales may sometimes form light stripes. &quot;O. attenuatus&quot; can attain a total length of to . The species is closely related to collared lizards. Its tail comprises two-thirds of its body length. Its scales are supported by an osteoderm which makes the body hard and stiff. The species has a pointed snout and a non-distinct head. Males and females are of similar size. Its markings may fade as an individual ages.

Unlike snakes, they have eyelids and ears. Slender glass lizards have some difficulty moving across smooth surfaces because they do not have the large belly-plates and related muscles of snakes. The body of a snake is more flexible than that of this species and have different shaped scales.

==Behavior==
Slender glass lizards are primarily diurnal and they can move fast. If captured, a specimen may thrash vigorously, causing part of the tail to fall off in one or more pieces. While a potential predator is distracted by the wiggling tail, the lizard quickly escapes. Observations have also reported the ability of western slender glass lizards to swim considerable distances when avoiding predation. They are known to sleep in burrows borrowed from other animals and they will use those burrows to hibernate. The species is active during the day when the weather is cool, but is only active during dawn and dusk when the temperature is hot. Similar to snakes, the species will hibernate in a hibernaculum. The species has also been known to make their own burrows in sandy soil. The lizard hibernates from October until April or May.

When a predator breaks off part of its tail, the tail never completely grows back which causes its tail to become shorter each time that it is attacked. They are known as slender glass lizards because their tail can be broken easily. The species can snap off their tail without it being touched and the partial tail that regenerates is tan, but it does not have the pattern of the original tail. The pieces of tail will continue to move once broken off. Two common beliefs are that the pieces of broken tail can grow into new lizards or rejoin into a new tail. In a 1989 study, 79% of the specimens in the population area had broken tails. It is hard to find a slender glass lizard that has its entire tail. They seldom bite when they are threatened. When they are approached, the lizard will sometimes stay still and try to blend in with the vegetation. 

==Distribution==
&quot;O. attenuatus&quot; is found in the midwestern and southeast United States, where it is endemic, in prairies, old fields, or open woodlands, often near water. They can also sometimes be found in longleaf pine forests and human-made debris.

==Diet and predators==
Slender glass lizards eat a range of insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets and beetles, and will also consume spiders, small rodents, and snails. They have also been known to eat small lizards and small snakes. Unlike snakes, glass lizards do not have flexible jaws, and this limits the size of prey items they can consume. The size of their food can be no larger than the size of their head. They forage underground in burrows. A fold of their skin is able to expand their body when they are breathing, eating a large meal, or when they are carrying eggs.

Broad-winged hawks, red-tailed hawks, opossums, coyotes, bob cats, and raccoons are predators of the lizard. Snakes that feed on the lizard include the eastern racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;), ring-necked snake (&quot;Diadophis punctatus&quot;), prairie kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis calligaster&quot;), common kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula&quot;), and copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;).

==Reproduction==
Mating typically occurs biannually in May and they lay 5 to 15 oval eggs in late June or July. Eggs hatch 50–60 days after being laid and the mother then stays beside them throughout the incubation period. The eggs are laid under objects that can cover them including a log or a board. The eggs hatch after 53 days during August to October. Hatchlings are long and are difficult to find. Sexual maturity is attained at three or four years of age.

==Conservation status==
Although not federally endangered in the United States, the Slender Glass Lizard is listed as vulnerable in Iowa and was listed as endangered in Wisconsin in 1979. In Iowa, it is illegal to capture them due to their vulnerability status. Primary threats include habitat loss and fragmentation stemming from human development. Insecticides also pose a threat to the lizard by eliminating their insect prey and potentially introducing toxins into their diet through the contaminated insects.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources recommended steps to conserve the slender glass lizard which are to avoid burning grassland from April to October, to remove trees mechanically instead of using chemicals, and to limit insecticide use in areas where slender glass lizards are known to inhabit. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources recommends but does not require management and restoration of habitat for Slender Glass Lizards. Suggestions include managing roadside grassy buffers with the lizards in mind, as these buffers serve as important habitat. Management of invasive plant species encroaching on grasslands is also recommended.

<text>The City of Knox is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It has an area of and in 2020, Knox had a population of 165,147. This municipality is one of only a handful that survived the widespread municipal amalgamations that occurred in Victoria in the early 1990s.

==History==

The City of Knox was named after Sir George Hodges Knox (1885–1960), a former soldier and speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. The City of Knox Crest incorporates his family&#x27;s motto &#x27;Move and Prosper&#x27;.

The area which is now Knox was once part of the Scoresby Riding of the Shire of Berwick. On 23 May 1889, the riding was severed to create the Shire of Fern Tree Gully, which extended as far east as Olinda and Monbulk in the Dandenong Ranges. Post-World War II development in the area closer to Melbourne led to rapid urbanisation and population growth—over 21,000 residents lived in the Knox area by the 1961 Census. A plebiscite to determine local residents&#x27; views led to the creation of the Shire of Knox on 9 October 1963, which was proclaimed on 16 November 1963 by the Governor of Victoria. It was declared a City on 4 July 1969. By the 1986 Census, the area was home to over 100,000 residents.

On 15 December 1994, the City of Knox was one of the few councils (and one of only four in Melbourne) to survive the statewide amalgamation and its boundaries extended to add the suburb of Upper Ferntree Gully and part of Lysterfield from the former Shire of Sherbrooke.

==Wards==

At present, the City of Knox has nine wards, each electing one councillor for a period of four years.

* Baird ward
* Chandler ward
* Collier ward
* Dinsdale ward
* Dobson ward
* Friberg ward
* Scott ward
* Taylor ward
* Tirhatuan ward

Prior to 1994, the Council had three wards, each of which elected three councillors:
* Bayswater/Wantirna ward
* Boronia ward
* Rowville/Scoresby ward

==Council==
Knox City Council is composed of nine single-member wards. The mayor and deputy are elected by councillors at an annual meeting in November.

===Current composition===
The most recent election was held in October 2024. The current council, as of November 2024, is:

<text>Mexitli (), Mexi, or Mezih was a legendary great leader and war priest of the Aztecs during the &quot;wandering years&quot; when they were a nomadic tribe. After wandering for 200 years, they settled on two islands on Lake Texcoco where, in 1325, they founded Tenochtitlan, what is now modern-day Mexico City. The Aztecs became known as the Mexica, possibly in Mexitli&#x27;s honor.

On stage, the band consisted of between 15 and 25 members, and toured with acts including Stevie Wonder. Other notable Azteca alumni included vocalists Wendy Haas and Errol Knowles, guitarist Neal Schon, trumpeters Tom Harrell and Eddie Henderson, bassist Paul Jackson, drummers Lenny White and John H. Brinck Jr., and percussionist Victor Pantoja. The group was also a musical starting point for Latin percussionist Sheila E. (the daughter of Pete Escovedo), who appeared with the band as a teenager. Two albums were released on Columbia Records, the self-titled &quot;Azteca&quot; (1972) and &quot;Pyramid of the Moon&quot; (1973), before the band split up.

On September 15, 2007, a number of the surviving members of Azteca performed together for the first time in more than thirty years in Hollywood, California. The concert was recorded for an eventual DVD release.

<doc id="466854" wikidata="Q1305323" url="?curid=466854" title="FileVault">
<text>FileVault is a disk encryption program in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther (2003) and later. It performs on-the-fly encryption with volumes on Mac computers.

==Versions and key features==
FileVault was introduced with Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, and could only be applied to a user&#x27;s home directory, not the startup volume. The operating system uses an encrypted sparse disk image (a large single file) to present a volume for the home directory. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard use more modern sparse bundle disk images which spread the data over 8 MB files (called &quot;bands&quot;) within a bundle. Apple refers to this original iteration of FileVault as &quot;legacy FileVault&quot;.

OS X 10.7 Lion and newer versions offer FileVault 2, which is a significant redesign. This encrypts the entire OS X startup volume and typically includes the home directory, abandoning the disk image approach. For this approach to disk encryption, authorised users&#x27; information is loaded from a separate non-encrypted boot volume (partition/slice type Apple_Boot).

==FileVault==
The original version of FileVault was added in Mac OS X Panther to encrypt a user&#x27;s home directory.

===Master passwords and recovery keys===
When FileVault is enabled the system invites the user to create a master password for the computer. If a user password is forgotten, the master password or recovery key may be used to decrypt the files instead. FileVault recovery key is different from a Mac recovery key, which is a 28-character code used to reset your password or regain access to your Apple ID.

===Migration===
Migration of FileVault home directories is subject to two limitations:
* there must be no prior migration to the target computer
* the target must have no existing user accounts.
If Migration Assistant has already been used or if there are user accounts on the target:
* before migration, FileVault must be disabled at the source.

If transferring FileVault data from a previous Mac that uses 10.4 using the built-in utility to move data to a new machine, the data continues to be stored in the old sparse image format, and the user must turn FileVault off and then on again to re-encrypt in the new sparse bundle format.

===Manual encryption===
Instead of using FileVault to encrypt a user&#x27;s home directory, using Disk Utility a user can create an encrypted disk image themselves and store any subset of their home directory in there (for example, ). This encrypted image behaves similar to a FileVault encrypted home directory, but is under the user&#x27;s maintenance.

Encrypting only a part of a user&#x27;s home directory might be problematic when applications need access to the encrypted files, which will not be available until the user mounts the encrypted image. This can be mitigated to a certain extent by making symbolic links for these specific files.

===Limitations and issues===
====Backups====
Without Mac OS X Server, Time Machine will back up a FileVault home directory only while the user is logged out. In such cases, Time Machine is limited to backing up the home directory in its entirety. Using Mac OS X Server as a Time Machine destination, backups of FileVault home directories occur while users are logged in.

Because FileVault restricts the ways in which other users&#x27; processes can access the user&#x27;s content, some third party backup solutions can back up the contents of a user&#x27;s FileVault home directory only if other parts of the computer (including other users&#x27; home directories) are excluded.

====Issues====
Several shortcomings were identified in legacy FileVault. Its security can be broken by cracking either 1024-bit RSA or 3DES-EDE.

Legacy FileVault used the CBC mode of operation (see disk encryption theory); FileVault 2 uses stronger XTS-AES mode. Another issue is storage of keys in the macOS &quot;safe sleep&quot; mode. A study published in 2008 found data remanence in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and much longer times when memory chips were cooled to low temperature. The study authors were able to use a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular disk encryption systems, including FileVault, by taking advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in key scheduling. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a &quot;sleep&quot; state, when not in physical control by the owner.

Early versions of FileVault automatically stored the user&#x27;s passphrase in the system keychain, requiring the user to notice and manually disable this security hole.

In 2006, following a talk at the 23rd Chaos Communication Congress titled &quot;Unlocking FileVault: An Analysis of Apple&#x27;s Encrypted Disk Storage System&quot;, Jacob Appelbaum &amp; Ralf-Philipp Weinmann released &quot;VileFault&quot; which decrypts encrypted Mac OS X disk image files.

A free space wipe using Disk Utility left a large portion of previously deleted file remnants intact. Similarly, FileVault compact operations only wiped small parts of previously deleted data.

==FileVault 2==
===Security===
FileVault uses the user&#x27;s login password as the encryption passphrase. It uses the XTS-AES mode of AES with 128 bit blocks and a 256 bit key to encrypt the disk, as recommended by NIST. Only unlock-enabled users can start or unlock the drive. Once unlocked, other users may also use the computer until it is shut down.

===Performance===
The I/O performance penalty for using FileVault 2 was found to be in the order of around 3% when using CPUs with the AES instruction set, such as the Intel Core i, and OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite. Performance deterioration will be larger for CPUs without this instruction set, such as older Core CPUs.

===Master passwords and recovery keys===
When FileVault 2 is enabled while the system is running, the system creates and displays a recovery key for the computer, and optionally offers the user to store the key with Apple. The 120 bit recovery key is encoded with all letters and numbers 1 through 9, and read from , and therefore relies on the security of the PRNG used in macOS. During a cryptanalysis in 2012, this mechanism was found safe.

Changing the recovery key is not possible without re-encrypting the File Vault volume.

===Validation===
Users who use FileVault 2 in OS X 10.9 and above can validate their key correctly works after encryption by running in Terminal after encryption has finished. The key must be in form and will return true if correct.

==Starting the OS with FileVault 2 without a user account==
If a volume to be used for startup is erased and encrypted before clean installation of OS X 10.7.4 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion:

* there is a password for the volume
* the clean system will immediately behave as if FileVault was enabled &quot;after&quot; installation
* there is no recovery key, no option to store the key with Apple (but the system will behave as if a key was created)
* when the computer is started, &quot;Disk Password&quot; will appear at the EfiLoginUI – this may be used to unlock the volume and start the system
* the running system will present the traditional login window.

Apple describes this type of approach as &quot;Disk Password—based DEK&quot;.

<doc id="466856" wikidata="Q16842560" url="?curid=466856" title="Heartbeats (The Knife song)">
<text>&quot;Heartbeats&quot; is a song by Swedish electronic music duo the Knife. It was released in Sweden on 27 December 2002 as the lead single from their second studio album &quot;Deep Cuts&quot; (2003) and re-released on 4 October 2004.

The song was listed at number 15 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s top 500 songs of the 2000s and at number 87 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s top 100 songs of the 2000s. In October 2011, &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 95 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. Adjectives used to describe the music were &quot;haunting&quot; and &quot;electro&quot;. In Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1000 Songs: You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, it was said: &quot;The Stockholm siblings&#x27; love of synth pop, minimal beats and electronica create together a moving masterpiece. Singer Karin Dreijer&#x27;s hypnotic vocals recall both Björk and Siouxsie Sioux with her icy delivery of magical lines&quot;. 

The song has been covered by many acts such as José González, Royal Teeth, Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers, Amason and Ellie Goulding.

==Critical reception==
The song has received critical acclaim since its release. MusicOMH said that the song&#x27;s &quot;emotive lyrics merge with forward thinking production to create one of the most exciting electronica releases of the year&quot;, and Contactmusic.com stated the song had &quot;clever synth beats and Björkesque vocals&quot; with the ability to &quot;instil some fun and nostalgia into music.&quot; Gigwise.com said that the song was &quot;perhaps one of the most hypnotic and haunting electronic songs of recent times, [...] innately infectious from the outset.&quot; Several reviews commented that the song had a 1980s feel.

==José González version==

Argentine-Swedish singer-songwriter José González covered &quot;Heartbeats&quot; for his debut studio album, &quot;Veneer&quot; (2003), and released as its lead single in January 2006. In contrast to the electronic, synth-based original, González&#x27;s cover features only an acoustic classical guitar. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart following its use in an advertisement for the Sony Bravia television in November 2005, in which countless colorful balls bounce down the streets of Russian Hill in San Francisco.

There had been an argument about the naval estimates at the start of 1914, with Liberal opinion, including Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, objecting to ever-escalating naval expenditure, especially with a General Election due within a year or so. Winston Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) wanted to substitute 15 submarines for one planned battleship and six &quot;Polyphemus&quot;es for another.

<text>Skaneateles Lake ( , ) is one of the Finger Lakes in central New York in the United States. The name &quot;Skaneateles&quot; means &quot;long lake&quot; in one of the local Iroquoian languages. The lake is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Roof Garden of the Lakes&quot; because its altitude () is higher than the other Finger Lakes. It is one of the cleanest lakes in the United States.

It is long ( long including the bogs at the south end of the lake) and on average wide, with a surface area of , and a maximum depth of . The lake drains north via Skaneateles Creek, which flows into the Seneca River.

The cleanest of the Finger Lakes, its water is so pure that the city of Syracuse and other municipalities use it unfiltered. The City of Syracuse spends about $2.3 million a year to protect lake quality, sixteen people inspecting (usually twice a year) each of the 2600 properties in the watershed, which is relatively small, compared to other Finger Lakes. The lake is the second cleanest lake in the United States as measured by dissolved nitrogen, after Crater Lake in Oregon.

William Henry Seward called it &quot;The most beautiful body of water in the world.&quot;

==Description==
The shores of Skaneateles Lake are in three counties: Onondaga, Cayuga, and Cortland. The village of Skaneateles (population about 2,450) is at the northern end of the lake, in Onondaga County. Summer cottages appeared in 1881, increasing to more than 2000 residences around the lake in 2002. Generally new homes now are built for year-round occupancy rather than summer use and many summer cottages are replaced. The transient and seasonal population of this tourist destination and summer resort surges during the warmer months. 

Skaneateles Lake is separated from two other nearby Finger Lakes, Otisco and Owasco, by ridges some 600 feet above the waters, affording magnificent prospects on both sides. Much of the highland terrain is forested, with several large public preserves. Once more cultivated, this region was known for the teasel industry until 1930. Teasels were employed commercially by woolen mills to raise the nap on the material. Although some dairy farms remain in the highlands, occasionally remaining in the same family after many generations, much of the land no longer serves agriculture. There is some experimention with introduction of vineyards, which have proved so successful on the more western Finger Lakes. Skaneateles Lake, however, at elevation 863 feet, may offer a less salubrious microclimate than larger, deeper and lower lakes, like Cayuga Lake, at elevation 382 feet.

==Landmarks and features==
Landmarks and scenic features appear around the lake. Many historic buildings enhance the village of Skaneateles. Carpenter Falls are near the hamlet of New Hope about one mile inland from the southwest shore of the Lake. The hike down to the main waterfall from the road above is on an unimproved cliff face and quite dangerous. The falls are part of the Bahar Nature Preserve that extends along Bear Swamp Creek to the lake. The historic New Hope Mill (closed to public permanently) is nearby. Opposite Carpenter Point is Ten Mile Point, a favorite picnic destination. The southern end of the lake, bounded by high hills (below, right) differs in character from the north. Glen Haven, a hamlet located there, once featured a large resort hotel but now offers smaller visitor accommodations and seasonal dining. From 1860-1900, Dr. W. C. Thomas offered a water cure treatment at the Hotel Glen Haven. On the west side, the high Town of Niles, New York provides scenic prospects. On the east side, the high Town of Spafford offers panoramic views. Between these towns lies deep Glen Haven valley in the Town of Scott, New York, in the third county. The hamlet of Borodino in Spafford retains an 1830 church, little altered, in the Federal style and noted as a center of the abolitionist movement where Frederick Douglass spoke.

The lake has long been popular for recreational sailing. Regattas with yachts from other lakes as well as Skaneateles began in 1847. The Skaneateles Country Club now has a boating center. The Lightning, a racing dinghy, was designed and produced in Skaneateles, as was the Comet. There are few marinas or other commercial facilities on the lake shore. There is a New York state public boat launch site on the lake&#x27;s west side just south of the Skaneateles Country Club marina. Also, on the west side of the lake, about 6 miles south of the Skaneateles Country Club Marina, in the hamlet Mandana, lies the Skaneateles Marina. The town of Spafford has a public boat launch near Borodino on the east side of the lake about four miles south of the Skaneateles Sailing Club. Glen Haven, at the head of the lake (The Finger Lakes flow South to North), offers a marina and docking. Cruises are available from the village. A mailboat serving cottages along the lake also carries passengers.

==Wildlife==

In its 2012 Angler Diary, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation cites thirteen species of fish that live in Skaneateles Lake. These species include: rainbow trout, lake trout, lake whitefish, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, cisco, rock bass, chain pickerel, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, brown bullhead, bluegill, and common carp. The lake trout are naturally reproducing, while 20,000 rainbow trout and 9,000 landlocked salmon are stocked annually.

A large die-off of bass in the spring of 2007 was later confirmed to be due to viral hemorrhagic septicema (VHS), a virus-caused fish disease that has killed millions of fish in the Great Lakes since its presence was noticed in the region in 2005. This is the second of the Finger Lakes found to be contaminated with the virus, after its presence was detected in the westernmost of the Finger Lakes, Conesus Lake, in 2006. The virus and disease are not a threat to human health, but the state of New York is working to slow its spread to other lakes. New state bait regulations were announced on June 6, 2007, aimed at curbing the spread of VHS. VHS can be spread between bodies of water through live or frozen bait fish, roe, live wells, and ballast water, among other ways. Boats and fishing equipment should be disinfected before transfer from Skaneateles Lake to other bodies of water.

==Environmental issues==
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the lake is affected by pollution from agriculture sources (pesticide and fertilizer use, manure production, and sedimentation), residential sources (septic systems, lawn care, and construction), and streambank erosion. Contaminants from these sources include sediment, nitrogen- and phosphorus-based nutrients, pesticides, bacteria (including fecal coliform), viruses, and protozoa such as giardia and cryptosporidium. The lake has an unusually low watershed-to-lake ratio, and is considered oligotrophic, meaning it is low in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The water is clear and low in vegetation. However, the water clarity quality has reduced in recent years because of massive algal bloom outbreaks.

A stiff, sticky foam on the lake was reported in 2013 to have been visibly increasing for years. The foam accumulates on shorelines and in bays after strong winds. According to the Skaneateles Lake Association, a preliminary analysis indicated the source of the foam was anionic surfactants released during the natural breakdown of organic matter. The phenomenon was reported on other nearby lakes as well.

In 2017, the lake experienced a widespread blue-green algal bloom which tested positive for microcystin toxins, thus no longer making it one of the cleanest lakes in the US.

<text>The Arab Legion () was the police force, then regular army, of the Emirate of Transjordan, a British protectorate, in the early part of the 20th century, and then of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, an independent state, with a final Arabization of its command taking place in 1956, when British senior officers were replaced by Jordanian ones.

==Creation==
In October 1920, after taking over the Transjordan region from the Ottomans, the United Kingdom formed a unit of 150 men called the &quot;Mobile Force&quot;, under the command of Captain Frederick Gerard Peake, to defend the territory against both internal and external threats. The Mobile Force was based in Zarqa. 80% of its men were drawn from the local Chechen community.

It was quickly expanded to 1,000 men, recruiting Arabs who had served in the Ottoman Army. On 22 October 1923, the police were merged with the Reserve Mobile Force, still under Peake, who was now an employee of the Emirate of Transjordan. The new force was named &quot;Al Jeish al Arabi&quot; (&quot;the Arab Army&quot;) but was always known officially in English as the Arab Legion. The Arab Legion was financed by Britain and commanded by British officers. The Legion was formed as a police force to keep order among the tribes of Transjordan and to guard the important Jerusalem–Amman road.

On 1 April 1926, the Transjordan Frontier Force was formed from cadre drawn from the Arab Legion. It consisted of only 150 men and most of them were stationed along Transjordan&#x27;s roads. During this time the Arab Legion was reduced to 900 men and was also stripped of its machine guns, artillery, and communications troops.

In 1939, John Bagot Glubb, better known as &quot;Glubb Pasha&quot;, became the Legion&#x27;s commander, with Major General Abdul Qadir Pasha Al Jundi as his deputy commander. Together they transformed it into the best-trained Arab army.

==World War II==
During World War II, the Arab Legion took part in the British war effort against pro-Axis forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre. By then, the force had grown to 1,600 men.

The Legion, part of Iraqforce, contributed significantly in the Anglo-Iraqi War and in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, two decisive early victories for the Allies.
The top three officers representing the Legion who participated in the Victory March were Major General Abdul Qadir Pasha el Jundi, O.B.E., Colonel Bahjat Bey Tabbara, and Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Sudqui Bey, M.B.E.

==1948 Arab–Israeli War==

The Arab Legion actively participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. With a total strength of just over 6,000, the Arab Legion&#x27;s military contingent consisted of 4,500 men in four single battalion-sized regiments, each with their own armored car squadrons, and seven independent companies plus support troops. The regiments were organized into two brigades. 1st Brigade contained 1st and 3rd Regiments while 3rd brigade contained 2nd and 4th Regiments. There were also two artillery batteries with four 25-pounders each. On 9 February 1948 the Transjordan Frontier Force was disbanded with members being absorbed back into the Arab Legion. Although headed by Glubb, now a Lieutenant General, command in the field was by Brigadier Norman Lash.

The Legion was initially withdrawn from Palestine to Transjordanian territory, under instruction from the United Nations, prior to the end of the British Mandate. With the commencement of hostilities the Legion re-entered Palestine with 1st Brigade heading to Nablus and 2nd Brigade heading to Ramallah. The Arab Legion entered Palestine with other Arab forces on May 15, 1948, using the Allenby, now King Hussein, bridge as they were advancing to cover the approaches from Jenin, in the north to Alaffoula and from Al-Majame&#x27;a bridge on the Jordan River to Bissan Alaffoula.

There was considerable embarrassment from the UK government that British officers were employed in the Legion during the conflict and all of them, including a brigade commander, were ordered to return to Transjordan. This led to the bizarre spectacle of British officers leaving their units to return to Transjordan, only to sneak back across the border and rejoin the Arab Legion. Without exception all of the British officers returned to their units. John Platts-Mills, a Labour Member of Parliament, formally queried in Parliament why Glubb had not been prosecuted for serving in a foreign army in contravention of the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870.

Units of the Arab Legion were engaged in several battles with the Jewish forces, including the following:
* Attacking Ben Shemen convoy at Beit Nabala – 14 December 1947 
* Battle of Neve Yaakov settlement – 18 April 1948
* Attacking Kibutz Gesher on 27–28 April 1948 
* Occupation of the Tegart fort at Latrun on 17 May 1948, and later the Battles of Latrun from 20 May to 18 July 1948.
* Siege of Jerusalem from 17 May to 18 July 1948,
* Attacking and capturing (but later losing) Kibbutz Gezer on 10 June 1948,
* Tarqumiya on 24 October 1948

By the end of the war in 1949, the Arab Legion consisted of over 10,000 men manning a 100-mile front, which then expanded to a 400-mile front following the withdrawal of Iraqi forces.

==Further clashes with Israel==
On September 11, 1956, an Israeli force in what the IDF termed one of its retribution operations, Operation Jehonathan, raided Jordanian territory at Al-Rahwa, Hebron Sector, attacking the police station and clashing with a unit from the Legion&#x27;s Desert Force. Over twenty soldiers and policemen were killed.

The Legion generally stayed out of the 1956 Suez Crisis.

==Jordanian army==
On 1 March 1956, the Arab Legion was renamed as the Arab Army (now Jordanian Armed Forces) as part of the Arabization of its command, under which King Hussein of Jordan dismissed the Legion&#x27;s British commander &quot;Glubb Pasha&quot; and other senior British officers. In Israel, the Hebrew term &quot;Ligioner&quot; (ליגיונר), i.e. &quot;Legionary&quot; was still informally used for Jordanian soldiers for many years afterwards, also at the time of the 1967 war and its aftermath.

==Commanders==
* Colonel Frederick Peake (&quot;Peake Pasha&quot;) – 22 October 1923 – 21 March 1939
* Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Stafford (&quot;Stafford Bey&quot;) 2nd IC—1924–1931.
* Lieutenant General John Glubb, KCB, CMG, DSO, OBE, MC (&quot;Glubb Pasha&quot;) – 21 March 1939 – 1 March 1956
* Major General Abdul Qadir Pasha Al Jundi, O.B.E. (&quot;Abdul Qadir Pasha&quot;) - 1–25 March 1956

Note: &quot;Pasha&quot; is a Turkish honorary title, one of various ranks, and is equivalent to the British title of &quot;Lord&quot;. Bey is equivalent to a knighthood or &quot;Sir&quot;.

<text>Bücker-Flugzeugbau GmbH was a German aircraft manufacturer founded in 1932. It was most notable for Its highly regarded sports planes which went on to be used as trainers by the Luftwaffe during World War II.

==History==
The company was founded by , who had served as an officer in the Imperial German Navy during World War I and then spent some years in Sweden establishing the Svenska Aero factory. With the sale of this business at the end of 1932, Bücker returned to his native Germany where he opened his new factory in Johannisthal, Berlin in 1934, but moved to a new built bigger factory in Rangsdorf in 1935.

Bücker&#x27;s three great successes were the Bücker Bü 131 &quot;Jungmann&quot; (1934), the Bü 133 &quot;Jungmeister&quot; (1936) and the Bü 181 &quot;Bestmann&quot; (1939). As well as these, the company built designs from several other manufacturers under licence, including the Focke-Wulf Fw 44, the DFS 230, and components for the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Junkers Ju 87, and Henschel Hs 293.

During the war, forced labour was used at the Bücker works. Up to 500 prisoners from the Soviet Union lived in a nearby prison camp under bad conditions; there were also forced labourers from France, Italy, and other countries.

At the end of World War II, the company’s premises fell into the Soviet occupation zone, and were seized. The company was then broken up. The Soviet army used the premises for aviation maintenance until their withdrawal from Germany in the 1990s.

The Bü 181 continued to be built in Czechoslovakia and Egypt after the war.

<text>The City of Kingston is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, its northern boundary lying approximately 15 km from the Melbourne city centre along the north-eastern shorelines of Port Phillip. It covers an area of 91 km² and has an estimated population of 163,431 people.

==History==

The City of Kingston area was originally governed by the Moorabbin Roads Board, which formed in 1862 and became a shire council in 1871, covering a large area of mixed agricultural and semi-urban land. After years of agitation, in 1917 the seaside town of Sandringham became a borough with its own council, and this fuelled the desire of those living in towns further south to combine their efforts and demand self-representation. This finally occurred in May 1920 and the &quot;Borough of Mordialloc and Mentone&quot; was formed. It became a town in 1923 and the City of Mordialloc in 1926.

The City of Moorabbin had a population of 109,588 by the time of the 1971 census.

In 1994, the state government amalgamated local councils all over Victoria, as part of its local government reform. The new City of Kingston was one result, and on 15 December 1994 the City was formally Gazetted comprising all of the City of Chelsea, most of the City of Mordialloc, a substantial portion of the City of Moorabbin, and parts of the Cities of Oakleigh and Springvale.

A new electoral structure for Kingston was effected in November 2008. Under the new structure there are three wards – North Ward, Central Ward and South Ward, and three Councillors representing each ward. This makes a total of nine Councillors, instead of the previous structure of seven wards each represented by one Councillor, and as of November 2020 there are 11 wards each individually represented by a ward councillor.

Kingston&#x27;s headquarters are located at the 7-storey &#x27;1230 Nepean Hwy&#x27; building, which has become a landmark to Cheltenham as well as the council. The A-Grade office building was built in 1993.

<doc id="466888" wikidata="Q2744086" url="?curid=466888" title="Hurricane Hazel">
<text>Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest, second-costliest, and most intense hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm killed at least 469 people in Haiti before it struck the United States near the border between North and South Carolina as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95 fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, which raised the death toll by 81 people, mostly in Toronto. As a result of the high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.

In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40 percent of the coffee trees and 50 percent of the cacao crop, which affected the economy for several years. The hurricane made landfall near Calabash, North Carolina, and destroyed most waterfront dwellings. It then traveled north along the Atlantic coast. Hazel affected Virginia; Washington, D.C.; West Virginia; Maryland; Delaware; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; and New York. It brought gusts near and caused $281 million (1954 USD) in damage. When it was over Pennsylvania, Hazel consolidated with a cold front and turned northwest towards Canada. When it hit Ontario as an extratropical storm, rivers and streams in and around Toronto overflowed their banks, which caused severe flooding. As a result, many residential areas in the local floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland. In Canada alone, over C$135 million (: C$ billion) of damage was incurred.

The effects of Hazel were particularly unprecedented in Toronto because of a combination of heavy rainfall during the preceding weeks, a lack of experience in dealing with hurricanes, and the storm&#x27;s unexpected retention of power despite traveling over land. The storm stalled over the Toronto area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (: $ million) in aid.


==Meteorological history==

On October 5, a tropical wave with tropical-storm force winds was approaching the Lesser Antilles. Due to the potential for tropical storm formation, a Hurricane Hunters plane flew from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to investigate the system. When the plane reached the system, they observed a tropical cyclone about east of the island of Grenada with winds estimated at . The United States Weather Bureau promptly classified the system as Hurricane Hazel. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis later assessed that Hazel developed at 06:00 UTC on October 5 about east of Grenada. Although the Hurricane Hunters observed hurricane-force winds, the storm had a small eye in diameter and a central barometric pressure of . The winds were therefore revised downward to late on October 5, though it was estimated that the storm attained hurricane status at 00:00 UTC on October 6. At the same time, Hazel made landfall on Grenada with winds of .

After entering the Caribbean Sea, Hazel continued to present a small eye and wind diameter. The winds gradually increased as the storm moved westward, parallel to the northern coast of Venezuela. On October 8, the tiny eye increased to a diameter of , while the winds reached , although winds were estimated as high as . That day, the Hurricane Hunters encountered severe turbulence, which hospitalized one crew member and injured another. For the next five days, there were no further flights into the core of the hurricane; However, the planes continued to monitor the storm, with radar imagery indicating that the eye became open and ragged. Late on October 9, it is estimated Hazel intensified into a major hurricane with winds of . Originally, it was estimated that Hazel attained these winds the day prior. The intensification was confirmed on October 10, when aircraft noted a well-defined eye on radar imagery.

On October 10, Hazel slowed in the central Caribbean and turned sharply to the north-northeast toward Hispaniola, steered by an upper-level low. At 09:00 UTC on October 12, the hurricane made landfall near Chardonnières along the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. There were no strong wind readings at landfall, but based on previous radar and aircraft observations the sustained winds were officially estimated at . After moving through the Gulf of Gonâve, Hazel struck northwestern Haiti near Baie-de-Henne at 00:00 UTC on October 13, as a Category 2 hurricane with winds estimated at . Around that time, the hurricane curved more to the north and northwest due to an approaching trough, and the Hurricane Hunters resumed entering the center of Hazel, reporting an eye and hurricane force winds. At 14:00 UTC on October 13, Hazel struck Inagua in the Bahamas with winds of .
After affecting the Bahamas, Hazel accelerated northwest toward the southeastern United States, steered between a trough and a ridge. Hurricanes are generally expected to lose power after going north of Florida due to lower water temperatures. However, Hazel restrengthened as it tracked northward over the Gulf Stream. The Hurricane Hunters were unable to observe the core of the storm until it neared land, reporting an eye in diameter on October 15. Later that day, a ship just off South Carolina reported a central pressure of , which was the lowest in association with the hurricane. At 15:30 UTC on October 15, Hazel made landfall just west of the North Carolina/South Carolina border with a eye, slightly northeast of Myrtle Beach in the latter state. Based on the pressure, a larger than average size, and the fast forward movement, the landfall intensity was estimated at , or a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.

The eye of Hazel was tracked across several towns in North Carolina as the system continued northward. At 18:00 UTC on October 15, the hurricane became extratropical near Raleigh, and within six hours had passed near Washington, D.C. Its extratropical remnants accelerated to the north through Pennsylvania and New York along an extended cold front. Despite widespread observations across the eastern United States, there continues to be uncertainty in the track of Hazel as an extratropical storm. The Canadian weather service maintains that the original circulation dissipated over western Pennsylvania and a new one formed over western New York. In contrast, the U.S. Hurricane Research Division later assessed the circulation as becoming elongated but continuous. On October 16, the storm crossed into Ontario and over the Toronto region. Shortly thereafter, the former Hurricane Hazel dropped to gale-force winds after moving almost over land. The storm slowed and turned northward, passing over James Bay early on October 17. After turning to the northeast, into what is today known as the Kativik region of extreme northern Quebec, the remnants of Hazel were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over Canada on October 18.
==Preparations==
On October 6, small craft warnings were issued for the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, despite predictions that Hazel would pass to the north; these warnings were canceled a day later. After the storm turned northward, tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the waters of the Mona Passage. Small craft near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm. The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base, ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened, fortified Quonset huts, flying aircraft out of the storm&#x27;s path, and positioning surface ships out at sea.

Then, on October 14, the United States Weather Bureau issued a warning for the Carolinas, with the caveat that the worst of the hurricane was expected to stay offshore. Instead, the storm took a sharp northwest turn and headed toward land. By evening of the same day, the storm was forecast to make landfall near the Carolinas border. Further forecasts expected Hazel to lose its power and dissipate over the Allegheny Mountains.

In her book &quot;Hurricane Hazel&quot;, Canadian journalist Betty Kennedy argued that in Canada, the impressions that Hazel was &quot;the best-kept secret in town&quot; and that it was a &quot;fully documented meteorological event that should have taken nobody by surprise&quot; both &quot;paradoxically [...] contain a great deal of truth&quot;. Meteorologists predicted that if Hazel merged with the cold front, the storm would not lose intensity, but would instead potentially strengthen. Two Special Weather Bulletins were issued by the Dominion Weather Office, but since it was expected that the storm would pass east of Toronto, few other warnings were given and there were no evacuations, which increased the eventual property damage and loss of life. The forecast called for high winds between , with only occasional showers. On lakes Erie and Ontario, ships received warnings of strong winds, and the predicted wind speeds ranged from . Toronto Hydro called in standby crews as heavy winds were forecast, although they were almost sent home at one point due to a lull in the storm.

There was significant rainfall in the Toronto area in the two weeks prior to Hazel, so the ground was already saturated. Few people in Canada had any experience with hurricanes, since it was unheard of for them to travel as far north and inland as Toronto. Kennedy also notes that if &quot;Toronto had been about to face a blizzard, or was threatened by a 14-inch [36-cm] snowfall, &quot;that&quot; [sic] would have been something understandable. [...] This was different. This was the unknown, the unfamiliar, the totally unexpected crisis. Hurricanes belonged in the tropics.&quot;

==Impact==
===Caribbean===
On October 8, two crew members on reconnaissance aircraft were injured due to turbulence while observing Hazel; one was severely enough injured to require hospitalisation. The ABC Islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, located north of Venezuela, received rough winds and rains of up to when the intensifying cyclone passed to the north. Flash flooding in Aruba and Curaçao destroyed a bridge and several water dams and resulted in losses of $350,000 (1954 USD). Puerto Rico suffered its worst flooding since 1899 as a result of the hurricane. Due to timely warnings, only nine people were killed (eight by drowning and one by a landslide), but infrastructure, buildings, and agricultural areas suffered serious damage, and over 11,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas.

In Haiti, Hazel brought flash floods which destroyed numerous villages, and high winds which caused considerable damage to major cities. The death toll was estimated to be as high as 1,000 people; most of the casualties drowned when the water flowed in a flood down the mountains, some of which were as high as . The situation was exacerbated by deforestation, which lessened the ability of the soil to hold water. Haiti&#x27;s South Peninsula took the brunt of the storm: the largest town, Aux Cayes, reported at least 200 casualties, while the second-largest town of Jérémie was reported to have been washed in the sea, with at least 200 more casualties. Damage in Aux Cayes was estimated to be $500,000 (1954 USD). Estimates of people left homeless in the wake of Hazel are as high as 100,000. Hazel destroyed about 40 percent of the coffee trees and 50 percent of the cacao crop, affecting the country&#x27;s economy for several years. Objects from Haiti, such as bowls, were reported to have been transported by the hurricane to the Carolinian coast.

West of Haiti, the hurricane brought hurricane-force winds to Cuba. A fisherman on the eastern tip of Cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats. Since the hurricane passed largely east of the Bahamas, only minor damage was reported there. Hazel passed directly over Inagua, where it claimed six lives when a sailboat capsized while taking shelter from the storm.

===United States===
In South Carolina, the storm produced tides along the coast. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed, including about 80 percent of waterfront dwellings in Myrtle Beach. As a result of the high storm surge, the low-lying sandy barrier islands were completely flooded. Two piers in Myrtle Beach were damaged. In North Myrtle Beach, a three-story hotel and an pier were washed out to sea. At Cherry Grove Beach, 75 residences were demolished, while at Pawleys Island, 40 homes were destroyed, while numerous others were damaged. One death occurred in South Carolina. Damage in the state totaled about $27 million.

At landfall, the hurricane brought a storm surge of over to a large area of coastline, producing severe coastal damage; the damage was greater since the hurricane coincided with the highest lunar tide of the year. Brunswick County, North Carolina, suffered the heaviest damage, where most coastal dwellings were either destroyed or severely damaged. For example, in Long Beach, North Carolina, only five of the 357 buildings were left standing. The official report from the Weather Bureau in Raleigh, North Carolina stated that as a result of Hazel, &quot;all traces of civilization on the immediate waterfront between the state line and Cape Fear were practically annihilated.&quot; According to NOAA, &quot;every pier in a distance of 170 miles [270 kilometres] of coastline was demolished&quot;.

At the Raleigh-Durham Airport in North Carolina, gusts of were recorded; in surrounding cities, including Kinston, Goldsboro, and Faison, wind gusts were estimated to have reached . With such high winds state-wide, heavy damage was caused to forests, and to property as a result of falling trees. However, since the Carolinas, like the rest of the Southeastern United States, were suffering from a severe drought, the heavy rainfall brought by Hazel was welcome. In North Carolina, the most rain was received in the interior of the state: Robbins received of rain, and Carthage received .

Nineteen people were killed in North Carolina, with several hundred more injured; 15,000 homes were destroyed and another 39,000 were damaged. The number of people left homeless by the storm was &quot;uncounted thousands&quot;. Damages in the Carolinas amounted to $163 million, with $61 million incurred by beachfront property. Total damage in the United States ranged from $281 million to $308 million.

While Hazel caused the most damage in the Carolinas, the storm did not lose all of its intensity. Going north, Hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged with a cold front; however, it retained hurricane-strength winds and it continued to drop heavy rainfall.

In Virginia, wind gusts of over were observed at the Weather Bureau office in Norfolk. Roofs were blown off, trees and power lines were toppled, windows were shattered, and awnings were torn. The naval station suffered mainly minor damage to its temporary installations. The tugboat &quot;Indian&quot;, carrying five barges, sank in the James River; four of the eight crew members drowned. One building was demolished and several others were damaged in Portsmouth. The ferry &quot;Princess Anne&quot; was beached into the docks at Kiptopeke. An unfinished vessel at the Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News broke from its moorings and was swept into the shore of the James River. The roof of the customs house was detached and landed on the street. In Richmond, 200 store fronts were damaged, while part of the steeple at Trinity Methodist Church was toppled. Additionally, a microwave tower in Warsaw was knocked over. Approximately 50 percent of residents in Virginia lost telephone and electrical service for six days. The storm damaged approximately 18,000 homes and businesses. Overall, there were 12 deaths and about $15 million in damage.

After North Carolina, the storm went through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. In general, power was knocked out and trees were downed. Wind gusts throughout the area reached . Effects of the storm was able to break the incomplete battleship USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; from its moorings when she was based in Philadelphia Naval Shipyard as a parts ship, resulting in her running aground.

Though not near the center, a gust of was recorded in Battery Park, the highest wind speed ever recorded within the municipal boundaries of New York City.

Rain amounts were heavier on the western side of the storm. In West Virginia, the average amount of rain received was with localized amounts of reported in the Appalachians. To the north in Pittsburgh, only of rain was reported.

To the east, the Washington, D.C. area was particularly affected, and considerable flooding was reported in the Virginias and Maryland. Much of the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis were flooded, putting midshipmen to work the next day to clean up the debris. New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough, but to the south in Chesapeake Bay, the majority of crab pots were destroyed. Hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the Allegheny Mountains, which raised rivers and streams in the Pittsburgh area significantly above the flood mark. In Pennsylvania, the winds were still high enough to unroof several homes.

In upstate New York, the storm blocked highways and railroads. The tower of television station WTVE in Elmira was toppled by wind gusts; the station was off the air for 19 months.

===Canada===

After weeks of unusually high rainfall saturated the Greater Toronto Area, Hazel dropped additional rainfall, peaking at in Snelgrove, Ontario. In three hours, the city received of precipitation. Most of these rains ran off into rivers and creeks of Toronto, which raised water levels by as much as . Not built to withstand heavy flooding, Toronto&#x27;s infrastructure took a heavy hit: over 50 bridges, many parts of important highways, as well as numerous roads and railways were destroyed when the high water washed them out or carried debris and smashed them.

Floodwaters slowly rose in the Holland Marsh – a bowl-shaped valley near Bradford – allowing people to escape to the town. Highway 400, which passes through the marsh, was under as much as of water in some places when as much of water backed up. Much of the crops in the area were either swept away or ruined. After the water pumps failed due to debris, better equipment allowed the Holland Marsh to be drained by November 13. The Humber River in the west end of Toronto caused the most destruction as a result of an intense flash flood after most minor rivers and creeks drained into it. A team of five volunteer firefighters were killed when their fire truck was swept away as they were responding to help a stranded motorist. Communities in the Humber floodplain were devastated. In Woodbridge, the river swelled from its usual width of at its narrowest point to , and left hundreds homeless and nine dead. The Humber swept away of Raymore Drive and 14 nearby homes, killing 35 people out of the 81 Canadian fatalities. The rise of the river was unprecedented and the residents did not evacuate, which led to the high death toll. The Etobicoke Creek also overflowed its banks at the village of Long Branch, killing seven people after many dwellings were swept into Lake Ontario.

The death toll of 81 people has not since been equaled by a natural disaster in Canada. In addition to the casualties, over 4,000 families were left homeless. The Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada estimates the total cost of Hurricane Hazel for Canada, taking into account long-term effects such as economic disruption, the cost of lost property, and recovery costs, to be C$1.03 billion in 2004 dollars (1.59 billion in 2024 dollars).

==Aftermath==

===Haiti===
In the aftermath of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the recovery was very slow since many of the few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS &quot;Saipan&quot; deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel due to a lack of clean water.

===United States===
In the Carolinas, the National Guard was mobilized by the evening of October 15 to prevent looting along affected areas of the coastline. On October 17, President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared a &quot;major disaster&quot; in the Carolinas, and offered &quot;immediate and unlimited federal assistance.&quot; Recovery was quick, and by October 24, all but two units were demobilized. Another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts. An artificial sand dune barrier, long, was completed by October 30, which in the long run led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes. With Myrtle Beach a popular tourist destination, the Chamber of Commerce began an information campaign to inform the public, which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed, that the city would be ready for the coming summer. The rebuilding after the partial destruction would transform Myrtle Beach from a &quot;quaint summer colony to a high-rise resort city&quot;.

===Canada===
The army sent about 800 soldiers to Toronto to assist with the cleanup, providing blankets and mattresses. Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the Salvation Army received so many donations of clothes, footwear, blankets, food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed. A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3 million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope Pius XII, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company. A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was created after the storm to manage the area&#x27;s floodplains and rivers, such as building dams. The heavily flooded areas were expropriated and barred from having homes, and most of the land was later converted into an extensive park system along Toronto&#x27;s rivers. A footbridge dedicated to the victims crosses the Humber River in Raymore Park, which was the former Raymore Drive.

===Retirement===

As a result of the high death toll and catastrophic damage in the Caribbean, United States and Canada, the name &quot;Hazel&quot; was removed from the tropical storm naming list for 10 years, and then retired permanently in the spring of 1969, as the hurricane was still an active subject of research. It will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

<text>The Orthodox Church in Japan or Orthodox Church of Japan (, OCJ), also known as the Japanese Orthodox Church () is an autonomous Eastern Orthodox church within the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. () is a transcription from the Russian word for &quot;Christ,&quot; ().

==History==
===Early Orthodox Christianity===
The first purpose-built Orthodox Christian church to open in Japan was the wooden Russian Consulate chapel of the Resurrection of Christ, in Hakodate, Hokkaidō, consecrated in October 1860.

In July 1861, the young Russian Hieromonk Nikolay Kassatkin (subsequently canonized and known as Nicholas of Japan), arrived in Hakodate to serve at the consulate as a priest. He became the first to learn the local language and customs sufficiently to spread Orthodox Christianity amongst the local populace. Though the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s government at the time prohibited Japanese from converting to Christianity, some locals who frequented the chapel did convert in 1864. One of Kassatkin&#x27;s first converts was a Samurai, named Sawabe. These early converts acted as missionaries amongst their own families and community. While they were Kassatkin&#x27;s first converts in Japan, they were not the first Japanese to become Orthodox Christians: some Japanese who had settled in Russia had converted to Orthodox Christianity earlier. On Kassatkin&#x27;s initiative, the Russian Imperial government established the in 1870. Kassatkin&#x27;s early approach to spreading Orthodox Christianity throughout Japan involved a degree of indigenization. Kassatkin searched for the points of religious union between Orthodox Christianity and Buddhism and Shinto. It was envisioned by Kassatkin that the Orthodox Church would be the state religion of Japan, an institution to serve the state and to protect Japanese culture from Western influence.

Kassatkin moved to Tokyo in 1872; he remained in Japan for most of the time until his death in 1912, even during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. He was consecrated bishop in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire in March 1880 (initially with the title of auxiliary bishop of Reval; he became Archbishop of Tokyo and Japan from March 1906). Kassatkin travelled across Russia to collect funds for the construction of the Orthodox Cathedral in Tokyo, which was inaugurated in Kanda district in 1891 and went on to be known after him as Nikorai-do. Nikolay Kassatkin made Japanese translations of the New Testament and of some liturgical books (Lenten Triodion, Pentecostarion, Feast Services, Book of Psalms, Irmologion).

By the end of 1890, as reported by Kassatkin, the Orthodox Church in Japan (the Russian Spiritual Mission to Japan) had 18,625 baptized faithful.

===20th century===
The Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) created a politically difficult situation for the Orthodox Church in Japan. Although Kassatkin remained in Japan, he withdrew from public prayer as Orthodox liturgy required that prayers include blessings for the Japanese armed forces who at the time, were at war with Russia. Throughout the war, the Orthodox Church attended to the spiritual needs of 73,000 Russian POWs held prisoner by Japan. The POWs showed their gratitude by building a number of chapels for the Orthodox Church. Throughout this period, the church grew and by 1912, the Orthodox Church in Japan had some 33,017 members, organized into 266 congregations.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, communications with and support from the Church in Russia (in the USSR from 1922) diminished greatly. The Japanese government had new suspicions about the Japanese Orthodox Church; in particular fearing that the Soviets used it as a cover for espionage. The second bishop of Japan (from 1912), Sergius (Tikhomirov), was one of a handful of Russian émigré bishops who remained loyal to the USSR-based Moscow Patriarchate (rather than supporting the Yugoslavia-based ROCOR). From the late 1920s communion with the Moscow Patriarchate automatically implied loyalty to the government of the USSR - the Japanese government according treated Metropolitan Sergius with suspicion, and he was forced to resign his position in September 1940.

The Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 did serious damage to the Japanese Orthodox Church. The headquarters, Nikorai-do, was destroyed and burnt, including its library with many valuable documents. Nikorai-do was rebuilt in 1929 thanks to contributions gathered from the faithful, whom metropolitan Sergius visited nationwide.

During the Sino-Japanese War of 1937–1945, which merged into World War II (1939 to 1945), Christians in Japan - and especially the Orthodox Church - suffered severe conditions. During the war the Japanese Orthodox Church had had almost no foreign contact. Following the surrender of Japan (August 1945), the Allied occupation regime had a benevolent attitude toward Christian groups, given their predominantly American connections. As the majority of the Slavic- and Greek-Americans would attend local Orthodox Christian parishes and more Russian refugees began to arrive in Japan - fleeing the Communist regime in China - the Orthodox Christian community in Japan revived. In 1946, the precursor to the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), the &quot;Metropolia&quot; (a &quot;de facto&quot; independent jurisdiction at the time), on the initiative of U.S. Army Colonel Boris Pash, took steps to prevent the Moscow Patriarchate from re-establishing its control over the Japanese Church - despite the vigorous efforts Moscow undertook to this end. The following year the Japanese Church largely switched to come under the &quot;Metropolia&quot;′s jurisdiction, and would be governed by bishops sent from the U.S. by the &quot;Metropolia&quot; until March 1972. Several Japanese youths who would study at the &quot;Metroplia&quot;&#x27;s Saint Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary, then in New York City, would subsequently become leaders (primates) of the Japanese Church.
As the &quot;Metroplia&quot; in the late 1960s gradually restored relations with the Moscow Patriarchate (whose external activity was fully controlled and guided by the Soviet government and specifically by the KGB) with a view to obtaining autocephaly (i. e. legitimate administrative independence), the Japanese Church transferred to Russian Orthodox Church jurisdiction. On 10 April 1970, a few days prior to the death of Russian Patriarch Alexius I, the Moscow Patriarchate canonised Nikolay Kassatkin as part of a package deal of granting autocephaly to the OCA and re-establishing control over the Church of Japan. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople strongly condemned the act of granting autocephaly by the Moscow Patriarchate as violating canon law.

In March 1972, Metropolitan Vladimir (Nagosky) left for the United States, and on March 19, 1972, Theodosius (Nagashima) was elected the new primate.

In 1973, the Orthodox Church of Japan became a member of the World Council of Churches.

===21st century===
In 2005 the first Orthodox Christian male monastic house of the Japanese Autonomous Orthodox Church opened in Tokyo near Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Nikolai-do). The abbot of the monastic community, Hieromonk Gerasimus (Shevtsov) of the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, dispatched by the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate,
arrived in Japan at the end of 2005.

==Current administrative organization and statistics==
The Orthodox Church in Japan has four dioceses:

* Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Tokyo)
* Sendai Orthodox Church (Sendai)
* Kyoto Orthodox Church (Kyoto)
* Holy Resurrection Church of Hakodate (Hakodate)

Holy Resurrection CathedralThe Primate of the Orthodox Church in Japan was Daniel (Nushiro), Metropolitan of All Japan and Archbishop of Tokyo (May 2000 - his death August 2023). Before becoming Archbishop of Tokyo and Metropolitan of all Japan, Daniel had been bishop of Kyoto and since 2001 he had been also in charge of the Kyoto diocese as &quot;locum tenens&quot;. Bishop Seraphim Tsujie was appointed acting Archbishop.

As of the end of 2014, according to the data provided by the Ministry of Culture of Japan, the church had a total of 67 parishes (communities), 37 clergymen, and 9,619 followers (registered members).

The Orthodox Church in Japan runs the Tokyo Orthodox Seminary. The seminary accepts only male faithfuls and gives a three-year theological education to those who expect to become ordained presbyters and missionaries. The Seminary also publishes a monthly journal, &quot;Seikyo Jiho&quot;.

The Orthodox Church in Japan publishes religious books, including the Japanese Orthodox translation of the New Testament and Psalms and liturgical texts, available as texts alone or with musical scores. Its headquarters in Tokyo and local parishes publish brochures for the faithful looking for further religious education.

As of the end of 2021, according to the data provided by the Ministry of Culture of Japan, the church had a total of 64 parishes (communities), 25 clergymen, and 9,249 followers (registered members).

==Liturgy==
The Orthodox Church in Japan celebrates its liturgy in Japanese, and occasionally in other languages such as Church Slavonic or Greek. As many liturgical and Biblical texts were first translated into Japanese by Archbishop Nicolas and Nakai Tsugumaro, a Japanese Christian scholar of literary Chinese, their Japanese today reads archaically.

The liturgical style found in the community of the Orthodox Church in Japan remains influenced by that of the church in late-19th-century Russia.

<text>The City of Wyndham is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the outer south-western suburbs of Melbourne, within the Melbourne Metropolitan Area, between Melbourne and the regional city of Geelong. It has an area of . The city had a population of 292,011 as of the . For the year to 2018 the City of Wyndham increased its population by 14,251, the largest number of any LGA in Victoria, as well as being the second most populous and the second fastest growing at a rate of 5.9 per cent.

==History==

The Wyndham District was first incorporated as a local government entity on 6 October 1862. Under changes made to Local Government legislation, it became the Shire of Wyndham on 7 March 1864 and was renamed the Shire of Werribee on 15 December 1909.

With an initial size of and being largely rural in character, the shire ceded land to metropolitan Melbourne as suburban development encroached. On 6 January 1922 and 5 February 1941, the City of Footscray annexed two parcels of land totalling about 700 hectares. On 20 February 1957, the Altona Riding of the Shire of Werribee was severed and incorporated as the Shire of Altona, which became a City eleven years later. After this, the boundaries remained fairly stable, and on 20 March 1987 Werribee was proclaimed a City.

On 15 December 1994, during major restructuring of Victoria&#x27;s local governments, Werribee changed less than most – losing only some rural land around Exford in its north to the Shire of Melton, and Laverton Reserve on its eastern boundary to the City of Hobsons Bay. After 85 years of being known as Werribee, the area&#x27;s former name of Wyndham was restored.

==Population==

The City is home to numerous new housing estates in suburbs such as Williams Landing, Point Cook, Wyndham Vale, Truganina, Tarneit and Manor Lakes. The following table presents data from official census and other publications by the Australian Bureau of Statistics:



==Wards and councillors==

The City of Wyndham is divided into three wards (Chaffey, Harrison and Iramoo) and is represented by eleven elected councillors. The Victorian Electoral Commission undertook a representation review in 2011–2012, which resulted in the former Truganina ward being renamed Harrison ward. Ward boundaries were also redrawn. The council has adopted a portfolio system for councillors from 2013 onward.

Victorian local government elections were last held in October 2024, and the following were elected as councillors:

<doc id="466894" wikidata="Q1245808" url="?curid=466894" title="Dornier Do 11">
<text>The Dornier Do 11 was a German heavy bomber, developed in secret in the early 1930s. It was originally called the Dornier F before being renamed by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) in 1933, and was considered a heavy bomber at the time. It came into service in 1932, a continuation of a line of bomber designs from the Dornier Do P in 1930, and the Dornier Do Y in 1931. The line would continue to develop with the Dornier Do 13 and Dornier Do 23.

==Design and development==
One of the main features the Do 11 tested was a retractable undercarriage, but, due to problems with the gear, it was often left locked down. The aircraft entered service under the guise of a freight transport, and was used with the German railway in conjunction with Deutsche Luft Hansa, so that it could be shown publicly. What it was actually used for was as a trainer for the still secret &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. 

The aircraft had a number of problems, which resulted in some crashes, and was generally unpopular with pilots. Especially problematic were wing vibrations which resulted in various precautions and modifications. Attempts were made to correct its faults, resulting in the so-called Do 11D, the last model with the Do 11 name. The Do 13 was a &quot;simplified&quot; Do 11 and came next, but had so many problems of its own that it did not fully enter service, with several of the first planes off the assembly line crashing. The later Do 23 corrected many faults of the design, but was still a lackluster aircraft, and was withdrawn from service by 1936, and replaced by superior aircraft that had since been developed. 

The Do 11 is noteworthy as having served in secret and having been the main heavy bomber of the quietly developing &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, if only for a short while. It was also the first to have two large engines as opposed to its predecessors the Y and P, which used three and four engines respectively.

<doc id="466898" wikidata="Q310987" url="?curid=466898" title="Simeon Stylites">
<text>Simeon Stylites or Symeon the Stylite (Greek: Συμεών ό Στυλίτης; ; 2 September 459) was a Syrian Christian ascetic, who achieved notability by living 36 years on a small platform on top of a pillar near Aleppo (in modern Syria). Several other stylites later followed his model (the Greek word &quot;style&quot; means &quot;pillar&quot;). Simeon is venerated as a saint by the Eastern Catholic Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Roman Catholic Church. He is known formally as ]]Simeon Stylites the Elder to distinguish him from Simeon Stylites the Younger, Simeon Stylites III and Symeon Stylites of Lesbos.

== Sources ==
There exist three major early biographies of Simeon. The first of these is by Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, and is found within his work &quot;Religious History&quot;. This biography was written during Simeon&#x27;s lifetime, and Theodoret relates several events of which he claims to be an eyewitness. The narrator of a second biography names himself as Antonius, a disciple of Simeon&#x27;s. This work is of unknown date and provenance. The third is a Syriac source, which dates to 473. This is the longest of the three, and the most effusive in its praise of Simeon; it places Simeon on a par with the Old Testament prophets, and portrays him as a founder of the Christian Church. The three sources exhibit signs of independent development; although they each follow the same rough outline, they have hardly any narrative episodes in common.

All three sources have been translated into English by Robert Doran. The Syriac life has also been translated by Frederick Lent.

It is possible that traditional sources for the life of Simeon Stylites misrepresent his relation to Chalcedonian Christianity. Syriac letters in the British Museum attributed to Simeon Stylites indicate that he was a Miaphysite and opposed the result of the Chalcedonian council (Council of Chalcedon AD 451).

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Simeon was the son of a shepherd. He was born in Sis, now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province. Sis was in the Roman province of Cilicia. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 A.D., Cilicia became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. Christianity took hold quickly there.

According to Theodoret, Simeon developed a zeal for Christianity at the age of 13, following a reading of the Beatitudes. He entered a monastery before the age of 16. From the first day, he gave himself up to the practice of an austerity so extreme that his brethren judged him to be unsuited to any form of community life. They asked Simeon to leave the monastery.

He shut himself up in a hut for one and a half years, where he passed the whole of Lent without eating or drinking. When he emerged from the hut, his achievement was hailed as a miracle. He later took to standing continually upright so long as his limbs would sustain him.

After one and a half years in his hut, Simeon sought a rocky eminence on the slopes of what is now the Sheik Barakat Mountain, part of Mount Simeon. He chose to live within a narrow space, less than 20 meters in diameter. But crowds of pilgrims invaded the area to seek him out, asking his counsel or his prayers, and leaving him insufficient time for his own devotions. This eventually led him to adopt a new way of life.

=== Atop the pillar ===
In order to get away from the ever-increasing number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, leaving him little if any time for his private austerities, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in nearby Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria), and formed a small platform at the top. He determined to live out his life on this platform. For sustenance, small boys from the nearby village would climb up the pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats&#x27; milk. He may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley.

When the monastic Elders living in the desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to determine whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to come down from the pillar. They decided that if he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, but if he was willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him to stay where he was.

The first pillar that Simeon occupied was little more than 3 meters (10 ft). He later moved his platform to others, the last in the series reportedly more than from the ground. At the top of the pillar was a platform, which is believed to have been about one square meter and surrounded by a baluster.

Edward Gibbon in his &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; describes Simeon&#x27;s life as follows:

In this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat of thirty summers and the cold of as many winters. Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross, but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb this &quot;celestial&quot; life; and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.
Even on the highest of his columns, Simeon was not withdrawn from the world. If anything, the new pillar attracted even more people, both pilgrims who had earlier visited him and sightseers as well. Simeon was available each afternoon to talk with visitors. By means of a ladder, visitors were able to ascend within speaking distance. It is known that he wrote letters, the text of some of which have survived to this day, that he instructed disciples, and that he also lectured to those assembled beneath. He especially preached against profanity and usury. In contrast to the extreme austerity that he practiced, his preaching conveyed temperance and compassion and was marked with common sense and freedom from fanaticism.

Much of Simeon&#x27;s public ministry, like that of other Syrian ascetics, can be seen as socially cohesive in the context of the Roman East. In the face of the withdrawal of wealthy landowners to the large cities, holy men such as Simeon acted as impartial and necessary patrons and arbiters in disputes between peasant farmers and within the smaller towns.

=== Fame and final years ===
Reports of Simeon reached the church hierarchy and the imperial court. The Emperor Theodosius II and his wife Aelia Eudocia greatly respected Simeon and listened to his counsels, while the Emperor Leo I paid respectful attention to a letter he sent in favour of the Council of Chalcedon. Simeon is also said to have corresponded with Genevieve of Paris.

Patriarch Domninos II (441–448) of Antioch visited the monk and celebrated the Divine Liturgy on the pillar.

Evagrius Scholasticus records an instance in which Simeon denounced the emperor&#x27;s prefect Asclepiodotus to Emperor Theodosius for supposedly encouraging pagans and Jews and undermining Christians. Theodosius then fired Asclepiodotus

Once when Simeon was ill, Theodosius sent three bishops to beg him to come down and allow himself to be attended by physicians, but Simeon preferred to leave his cure in the hands of God, and before long he recovered.

A double wall was raised around him to keep the crowd of people from coming too close and disturbing his prayerful concentration. Women were, in general, not permitted beyond the wall, not even his own mother, whom he reportedly told, &quot;If we are worthy, we shall see one another in the life to come.&quot; She submitted to this, remaining in the area, and embraced the monastic life of silence and prayer. When she died, Simeon asked that her coffin be brought to him, and he reverently bade farewell to his dead mother.

Accounts differ with regard to how long Simeon lived upon the pillar, with estimates ranging from 35 to 42 years. He died on 2 September 459. A disciple found his body stooped over in prayer. The Patriarch of Antioch, Martyrius, performed the funeral of the monk before a huge crowd. He was buried not far from the pillar.

== Legacy ==
Simeon inspired many imitators. For the next century, ascetics living on pillars, stylites, were a common sight throughout the Christian Levant.

He is commemorated as a saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church, where his feast is on 29 Pashons. He is commemorated 1 September by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, and 5 January in the Roman Catholic Church.

A contest arose between Antioch and Constantinople for the possession of Simeon&#x27;s remains. The preference was given to Antioch, and the greater part of his relics were left there as a protection to the unwalled city. Pilgrim tokens for Simeon Stylites have been found across the Byzantine Empire, attesting to the popularity of his veneration.

The ruins of the vast edifice erected in his honour and known in Arabic as the &quot;Qalaat Semaan&quot; (&quot;the Fortress of Simeon&quot;) can still be seen. They are located about 30 km northwest of Aleppo () and consist of four basilicas built out from an octagonal court towards the four points of the compass to form a large cross. In the centre of the court stands the base of the &quot;style&quot; or column on which Simeon stood. On 12 May 2016, the pillar within the church reportedly took a hit from a missile, fired from what appeared to be Russian jets backing the Syrian government.

=== Cultural references ===
The life of Simeon Stylites inspired an 1842 poem by Alfred Tennyson, &quot;St. Simeon Stylites&quot;. Modern works based upon the life of the saint include Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Simón del desierto&quot;, Hans Zender&#x27;s 1986 opera &quot;Stephen Climax&quot; and the 1998 film &quot;At Sachem Farm&quot;. 

James Hamilton-Paterson&#x27;s Gerontius, a work of fiction based on Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s actual voyage to Brazil in 1923, includes a dream sequence in which the acolyte Rahut charges &quot;dreamers&quot; a fee to be allowed to ascend to the top of the pillar for a conversation with the ascetic. Awe mingles with horror as the visitor&#x27;s &quot;head sinks to the level of a pair of monstrous feet from whose rotting toes curl yellow nails.&quot;

<text>Carpet sharks are sharks classified in the order Orectolobiformes . Sometimes the common name &quot;carpet shark&quot; (given because many species resemble ornately patterned carpets) is used interchangeably with &quot;wobbegong&quot;, which is the common name of sharks in the family Orectolobidae. Carpet sharks have five gill slits, two spineless dorsal fins, and a small mouth that does not extend past the eyes. Many species have barbels.

==Characteristics==
The carpet sharks are a diverse group of sharks with differing sizes, appearances, diets, and habits. They first appeared in the fossil record in the Early Jurassic; the oldest known orectolobiform genera are &quot;Folipistrix&quot; (known from Toarcian to Aalenian of Belgium and Germany), &quot;Palaeobrachaelurus&quot; (Aalenian to Barremian) and &quot;Annea&quot; (Toarcian to Bajocian of Europe). All species have two dorsal fins and a relatively short, transverse mouth that does not extend behind the eyes. Besides the nostrils are barbels, tactile sensory organs, and grooves known as nasoral grooves connect the nostrils to the mouth. Five short gill slits are just in front of the origin of the pectoral fin and the fifth slit tends to overlap the fourth one. A spiracle occurs beneath each eye which is used in respiration. The only exception to this rule is the whale shark, the spiracles of which are situated just behind the eyes. Carpet sharks derive their common name from the fact that many species have a mottled appearance with intricate patterns reminiscent of carpet designs. The patterning provides camouflage when the fish is lying on the seabed. The largest carpet shark is the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;) which can grow to a length of . It is the largest species of fish, but despite its size, is not dangerous, as it is a filter feeder, drawing in water through its wide mouth and sifting out the plankton. The smallest carpet shark, at up to about long, is the barbelthroat carpet shark, (&quot;Cirrhoscyllium expolitum&quot;). Some of the most spectacularly coloured members of the order are the necklace carpet shark (&quot;Parascyllium variolatum&quot;), the zebra shark (&quot;Stegostoma fasciatum&quot;), and the ornate wobbegong (&quot;Orectolobus ornatus&quot;). Nurse sharks and whale sharks have a fringe of barbels on their snouts, and barbelthroat carpet sharks (&quot;Cirrhoscyllium expolitum&quot;) have barbels dangling from their throat regions. 

==Behaviour==
Most carpet sharks feed on the seabed in shallow to medium-depth waters, detecting and picking up molluscs, crustaceans, and other small creatures. The wobbegongs tend to be ambush predators, lying hidden on the seabed until prey approaches. One has been observed swallowing a bamboo shark whole.

The methods of reproduction of carpet sharks varies. Some species are oviparous and lay eggs which may be liberated directly into the water or may be enclosed in horny egg cases. Some female sharks have been observed to push egg cases into crevices and this would be an added protection for the developing embryos. Other species are ovoviviparous and the fertilised eggs are retained in the mother&#x27;s oviduct. There, the developing embryos, which are usually few in number, feed on their yolk sacs at first and later hatch out and feed on nutrients secreted by the walls of the oviduct. The young are born in an advanced state, ready to live independent lives.

==Distribution==
Carpet sharks are found in all the oceans of the world but predominantly in tropical and temperate waters. They are most common in the western Indo-Pacific region and are usually found in relatively deep water.

==Classification==
The order is small, with seven families in 13 genera and with a total of around 43 species:

<text>The City of Manningham is a local government area in Victoria, Australia in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and is divided into 12 suburbs, with the largest being Doncaster and Doncaster East. It comprises an area of 113 square kilometres and had a population of 125,508 in June 2018.

The district spans a roughly east–west direction along the southern banks of the Yarra River and across the undulating valleys of the Koonung, Ruffey and Mullum Mullum Creeks, alternating from typical low density suburban housing in the west to remnant bushland, within a green wedge, in the east. As such, the district encompasses the transition between the built and natural environments in Melbourne&#x27;s east and promotes itself as a &quot;balance of city and country&quot;.

Formerly the City of Doncaster &amp; Templestowe, the district is situated in the Wurundjeri nation&#x27;s territory. Most of the first European settlers to the area were orchardists, arriving through the 1850s. Gold was first discovered in Victoria around the same time at Andersons Creek, in Warrandyte, however, the district saw varied growth as periods of low density suburban development occurred sporadically throughout the mid-late 20th century.

==History==
The Manningham municipality was created on 15 December 1994, as part of a general restructure of Melbourne&#x27;s local government boundaries. The new municipality contains the former City of Doncaster &amp; Templestowe, but with part of Ringwood North ceded to the new City of Maroondah and Wonga Park, annexed from the former Shire of Lillydale.

The name Bulleen, a nearby suburb, was proposed for the new municipality, as it was the name of the shire predating the City of Doncaster and Templestowe. However, modern residents believed the name was too localised, so the name of one of the major roads was adopted. The origin of Manningham Road comes from the region of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. Residents&#x27; requests for the City to be named after Indigenous Australian names local to the area such as &quot;Mullum Mullum&quot; or &quot;Koonung&quot; were rejected.

==Transport==

Manningham is the only area in metropolitan Melbourne without a train line or tram route and therefore the area is heavily reliant on private cars. A Doncaster railway line had been planned for many decades; however the land was sold off in the 1980s. Residents have long campaigned for extension of the route 48 tram along Doncaster Road to Doncaster, Doncaster East or Donvale, although this is heavily supported by Local Governments, the issue has been consistently avoided by State Government.

There are increased bus services to cope with the demand for public transport, including four radial SmartBus routes, and two exclusive Manningham Mover circular routes. Most routes are operated by Kinetic Melbourne, which has a depot in Doncaster East, near the intersection of Blackburn and Doncaster Roads.

<text>Mel and Kim (stylized as MӗL &amp; KIM) were an English pop duo, consisting of sisters Melanie and Kim Appleby. Originally managed by Alan Whitehead, they achieved success between 1986 and 1988, before Melanie lost her battle with cancer in January 1990 at the age of 23.

The duo reached number one in the UK Singles Chart with their 1987 single &quot;Respectable&quot;, which also topped the US dance chart. They had three other UK Top 10 hits with &quot;Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)&quot; (1986), &quot;F.L.M.&quot; (1987) and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; (1988). In 1988, they were nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough Act. After Mel&#x27;s death, Kim embarked on a solo career and had two UK Top 10 hits with &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; (1990) and &quot;G.L.A.D.&quot; (1991).

==History== 
Mel &amp; Kim were born to English and Jamaican parents. In 1985, Mel recorded two demos solo, under Alan Whitehead&#x27;s management. Soon after, her sister Kim joined her and they performed as a duo, recording some demos. The demos got them signed with Supreme Records, and Nick East - president of Supreme - put them in touch with producers Stock Aitken Waterman.
They were managed at the time by Alan Whitehead, but as soon as their first single charted he was sacked.

&quot;I remember we were shocked that these were the guys who produced the Princess track &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your Number One&quot; because we were expecting someone like Quincy Jones,&quot; Kim said of her first meeting with the production team. &quot;We were convinced that they had some young groovy guy who was doing all the work, and they were just fronting it.&quot;

A sedate soul-pop track &quot;System&quot; was intended as their first single, but their producers were unhappy with it, and it became the &quot;B-side&quot; of their first release &quot;Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend)&quot;. After getting to know the girls, producer Pete Waterman became convinced the act&#x27;s music should reflect their feisty and streetwise personalities, with the then-emerging Chicago House sound chosen as a perfect vehicle.

&quot;We got a call from Nick East, saying they had decided to scrap &#x27;System&#x27; and we were devastated,&quot; Kim said. &quot;We thought we had done something wrong, but he explained that after hanging with us in the pub, Pete went back to the studio the next day and said, we need something completely tough; we need something with an attitude.&quot;

The reorientation worked; &quot;Showing Out&quot; reached number three on the British charts in 1986. It was a minor hit in America peaking at #78, but did peak at #1 on the Dance Chart there. Their next single &quot;Respectable&quot; reached number one in Britain, and sold in excess of 800,000 copies there. &quot;The follow up was genius,&quot; recalled Kim &quot;It started to go global; &#x27;Respectable&#x27; just took it to another level.&quot; The sisters became well-known celebrities in Europe, particularly in Britain, and were known for their visual style which combined urban street wear with high fashion (prior to their music career Mel had worked as a glamour model). Their third single &quot;F.L.M.&quot; reached number seven in the UK, while their final single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; reached number ten, giving them an unbroken run of top ten hits in the UK. In February 1988, they were nominated for Best British Breakthrough Act at the Brit Awards, losing out to Wet Wet Wet.

In 1985, prior to the duo&#x27;s recording career, Mel was treated for malignant paraganglioma, a form of cancer, on her liver. By January 1987, Mel was experiencing back problems, delaying the filming of the &quot;Respectable&quot; music video. During a promotional visit to Japan in June 1987, Mel&#x27;s back pain worsened, rendering her unable to perform, and she returned to the UK in a wheelchair. A recurrence of the cancer was detected in Mel&#x27;s spine after undergoing tests at Barts. The sisters withdrew from publicity while Mel underwent treatment, while trying to keep the diagnosis secret from the public and many colleagues. Planned studio time with PWL engineer Yoyo, where the sisters intended to work on developing their own compositions, was cancelled. 

Footage from their Montreux Festival performance was used to compile the &quot;F.L.M.&quot; music video, with the sisters mainly represented by a pair of lookalike marionettes. While the media speculated that Mel was being treated for cancer, both sisters categorically denied this, stating that Mel had suffered a debilitating back injury.

Kim later confessed she was &quot;devastated&quot; by the widely-panned &quot;F.L.M.&quot; video, having not been consulted on its contents, and only seeing it for the first time when it was aired on TV. The singer, who said that her sister Mel was equally dissatisfied with the clip, added that she would have preferred that no video was released at all. Nick East retrospectively described the video as a &quot;mistake.&quot;

Mel and Kim released a new single in February 1988, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot;, becoming their fourth consecutive UK top 10 hit. Mel discharged herself from hospital to record the vocals for the track. The B-side, &quot;You Changed My Life&quot;, was composed by the sisters during Mel&#x27;s treatment and was submitted to the producers as a potential single. Work on a second album produced by Stock Aitken Waterman was not continued, due to Mel&#x27;s illness. Both sisters appeared on the &quot;Wogan&quot; show in April 1988 while Mel was still undergoing treatment, as part of European Cancer Week. Later in late summer 1988, after Mel had finished chemotherapy, the duo appeared on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; to promote the need for teenage cancer wards in British hospitals.

The sisters then again withdrew from publicity while writing songs for a second album; several of these songs later appeared on Kim&#x27;s debut solo album. In a TV interview with Trisha Goddard in 2005, Kim revealed that she knew Mel&#x27;s illness was terminal in mid-1989. On 18 January 1990, Mel died suddenly of pneumonia after contracting a cold; her immune system weakened by chemotherapy.

In January 2018, the release of a previously unreleased unfinished demo track, &quot;Where Is Love&quot;, was announced on the official Mel &amp; Kim website. It was released in February 2018.

==After Mel and Kim==
With the aid of her then boyfriend, ex-Bros bassist Craig Logan, Kim launched a solo career with much of her debut solo album composed of songs co-written with Mel, for what was intended to be the next &quot;Mel and Kim&quot; album. The album, &quot;Kim Appleby&quot;, contained her debut solo single &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;, which reached number two on the British charts in November 1990. A follow-up single &quot;G.L.A.D&quot; was also a UK Top 10 hit. Subsequent singles from her debut album were &quot;Mama&quot; [#19] and &quot;If You Cared&quot; [#44]. Kim&#x27;s second album &quot;Breakaway&quot; was not a commercial success and had a limited release. She released three further singles, &quot;Light of the World&quot; [#41, 1993], &quot;Breakaway&quot; [#56, 1993], and &quot;Free Spirit&quot; [#51, 1994]. A download-only single called &quot;High&quot; was released in 2007.

In 2010, a deluxe double-disc edition of &quot;F.L.M.&quot; was released, which included extended bonus tracks as well as the single &quot;That&#x27;s The Way It Is&quot; and various remixes of the original hits.

In October 2019, Cherry Red Records released a seven-disc Mel &amp; Kim CD singles box set.

<doc id="466905" wikidata="Q7457842" url="?curid=466905" title="Severe Tire Damage (album)">
<text>Severe Tire Damage is a primarily live album by They Might Be Giants, released in 1998. It also features a few studio tracks, including a new single (&quot;Doctor Worm&quot;).

The live cuts, some recorded at soundchecks without any audience, feature at least one track from every album since their debut, which include a few old fan favorites that have been reworked since the duo adopted a full backing band. Songs like &quot;She&#x27;s an Angel&quot;, from their debut, &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot;, and &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;, from their major label debut, &quot;Flood&quot;, are treated to multiple guitars and a horn section. Conversely, the song &quot;Meet James Ensor&quot; originally appeared on their first full band effort, &quot;John Henry&quot; (1994) and surfaces here in a bare-bones rendition, with only vocals and an accordion.

Besides the aforementioned lack of an audience on several tracks, some tracks have also undergone studio &quot;retooling&quot; - most notably, &quot;Ana Ng,&quot; which appeared in its untampered form (with an uncropped intro and without a heavily distorted voice saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want the world...&quot;) on the 1994 promo-only release &quot;Live!! New York City.&quot;

A condensed version of this album was released as &quot;Live&quot;, which featured 10 of the 24 tracks listed here.

==Song notes==
* Tracks 1, 2, and 17 were recorded in a studio rather than onstage; track 15 was recorded in a hotel room.
* Tracks 18-24 are hidden songs that were improvised in concert, based on the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movie series. 
* &quot;First Kiss&quot; was later reworked and put on the 2001 album &quot;Mink Car&quot; as &quot;Another First Kiss&quot;, with the same basic melody and similar lyrics but a substantially different style and tempo.
* &quot;About Me&quot; stops at 0:41 and is followed by 2 minutes of silence, to &quot;bury&quot; the Planet of the Apes tracks.
* Similarly, &quot;They Got Lost&quot; was later recorded in the studio at a slower tempo, and was released on &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; as well as later being the title track on the rarities compilation album &quot;They Got Lost&quot;.
* On Track 3, &quot;They Get Lost&quot;, the band is introduced incorrectly as &quot;They Must Be Giants&quot;, which is a tongue-in-cheek reference to an untitled, partial recording that appears as track 13 on both &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; and its re-release &quot;Miscellaneous T&quot;. It was inadvertently left on the Dial-A-Song answering machine, in which a confused listener named Gloria talks to an unknown third party about the mystery of &quot;There May Be Giants&quot; and &quot;There Must Be Giants&quot;, as she mistakenly refers to the band. It would later be referenced when Bryant Gumbel referred to them as &quot;They Must Be Giants&quot; when they performed &quot;Your Racist Friend&quot; on &quot;Today&quot; to promote the release of &quot;Flood&quot;.

==Song origins==
* Studio version of track 4 originally appeared on the &quot;Why Does The Sun Shine? (The Sun Is a Mass of Incandescent Gas)&quot; EP (1993)
* Studio versions of tracks 5, 8 and 12 originally appeared on &quot;Flood&quot; (1990)
* Studio version of track 6 originally appeared on &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; (1986)
* Studio versions of tracks 7, 14 and 16 originally appeared on &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; (1996)
* Studio version of track 9 originally appeared on &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1988)
* Studio versions of tracks 11 and 13 originally appeared on &quot;Apollo 18&quot; (1992)
* Studio version of track 15 originally appeared on &quot;John Henry&quot; (1994)

<text>The Llano Estacado (), sometimes translated into English as the Staked Plains, is a region in the Southwestern United States that encompasses parts of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas. One of the largest mesas or tablelands on the North American continent, the elevation rises from in the southeast to over in the northwest, sloping almost uniformly at about .

==Naming==
The Spanish name is often interpreted as meaning &quot;Staked Plains&quot;, although &quot;stockaded&quot; or &quot;palisaded plains&quot; have also been proposed, in which case the name would derive from the steep escarpments on the eastern, northern, and western periphery of the plains. Leatherwood writes that Francisco Coronado and other European explorers described the Mescalero Ridge on the western boundary as resembling &quot;palisades, ramparts, or stockades&quot; of a fort, but does not present the original Spanish. 
In &quot;Beyond the Mississippi&quot; (1867), Albert D. Richardson, who traversed the region from east to west in October 1859, wrote that &quot;the ancient Mexicans marked a route with stakes over this vast desert, and hence its name.&quot; Other sources refer to &quot;stakes&quot; used to mark routes on the featureless plain, often meaning piles of stone, bone, and cow dung. According to &quot;Place Names of New Mexico&quot;, others have speculated that &quot;stakes&quot; refers to the yucca plants that dot the plains.
Leatherwood opines in the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot; that such way markers could plausibly explain the origin of the name, but that the &quot;comparison of cliff formations and palisades made by explorers argues more convincingly for the geological origin&quot;. In his &quot;Roadside Geology of Texas&quot;, Geologist Darwin Spearing also prefers the geological solution to the etymology:

==Geography and climate==
The Llano Estacado lies at the southern end of the Western High Plains ecoregion of the Great Plains of North America; it is part of what was once called the Great American Desert. The Canadian River forms the Llano&#x27;s northern boundary, separating it from the rest of the High Plains. To the east, the Caprock Escarpment, a precipitous cliff about high, lies between the Llano and the red Permian plains of Texas; while to the west, the Mescalero Escarpment demarcates the eastern edge of the Pecos River valley. The Llano has no natural southern boundary, instead blending into the Edwards Plateau near Big Spring, Texas. This geographic area stretches about north to south, and east to west, a total area of some , larger than Indiana and 12 other states. It covers all or part of 33 Texas counties and four New Mexico counties. The area is susceptible to frequent dust storms because of its low relief, frequent turbulent winds, lack of vegetation, and loose topsoil. The landscape is dotted by numerous small playa lakes, depressions that seasonally fill with water and provide habitat for waterfowl.

The Llano Estacado has a cold semiarid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), characterized by long, hot summers and cold winters. Rainfall is relatively low; the entire region receives fewer than of rainfall annually, and the western part receives as little as . High summer temperatures (average high July temperature above 90 °F or 32 °C) mean that most of the small amount of precipitation is lost to evaporation, making dryland farming difficult.

The Texas State Historical Society states it covers all or part of 33 Texas counties, six fewer than as depicted by a US Geological Survey map, and four New Mexico counties.

As depicted by a US Geological Survey map, the Llano Estacado includes all or part of these Texas counties:
It also includes all or part of the following New Mexico counties:
*Curry
*Lea
*Quay
*Roosevelt

Several interstate highways serve the Llano Estacado. Interstate 40 crosses the northern portion from east of Amarillo to Tucumcari, New Mexico. Interstate 27 runs north-south between Amarillo and Lubbock, while Interstate 20 passes through the southern portion of the Llano Estacado west of Midland and Odessa.

==History==
Spanish conquistador Francisco Coronado, the first European to traverse this &quot;sea of grass&quot; in 1541, described it as follows:

I reached some plains so vast, that I did not find their limit anywhere I went, although I traveled over them for more than 300 leagues ... with no more land marks than if we had been swallowed up by the sea ... there was not a stone, nor bit of rising ground, nor a tree, nor a shrub, nor anything to go by.

In the early 18th century, the Comanches expanded their territory into the Llano Estacado, displacing the Apaches who had previously lived there. The region became part of the Comancheria, a Comanche stronghold until the final defeat of the tribe in the late 19th century. The Comanche war trail extended from Llano Estacado to the Rio Grande into Chihuahua, &quot;the trail ran southwesterly through Big Spring to the Horsehead Crossing of the Pecos River, then forked southward to the Comanche Springs where it divided, one part of the trail crossing the great river near Boquillas and the other at Presidio.&quot;

Rachel Plummer, while a captive of the Comanche in 1836, mentioned the &quot;table lands between Austin and Santa Fe&quot;.

Robert Neighbors and Rip Ford, guided by Buffalo Hump, blazed the &quot;upper route&quot; trail from San Antonio to El Paso in 1849 for emigrants during the California Gold Rush, &quot;... travelling across an elevated plateau almost covered by rock ...&quot;

After his 1852 expedition to explore the headwaters of the Red and Colorado Rivers, General Randolph Marcy wrote: &quot;[not] a tree, shrub, or any other herbage to intercept the vision ... the almost total absence of water causes all animals to shun it: even the Indians do not venture to cross it except at two or three places.&quot; In his report for the United States Army:

When we were upon the high table-land, a view presented itself as boundless as the ocean. Not a tree, shrub, or any other object, either animate or inanimate, relieved the dreary monotony of the prospect; it was a vast-illimitable expanse of desert prairie . ... the great Sahara of North America. it is a region almost as vast and trackless as the ocean—a land where no man, either savage or civilized permanently abides ... a treeless, desolate waste of uninhabitable solitude, which always has been, and must continue uninhabited forever.
During the 1854 Marcy-Neighbors expedition, Dr. George Getz Shumard noted, &quot;Beyond the mountain appeared a line of high bluffs (the Llano Estacado) which in the distance looked like clouds floating upon the horizon.&quot;

Herman Lehmann was captured by the Apache in 1870 and described the Llano Estacado as &quot;open, but not exactly a desert&quot;.

Robert G. Carter described it in 1871 while pursuing Quanah Parker with Ranald S. Mackenzie, &quot;... all were over and out of the canyon upon what appeared to be a vast, almost illimitable expanse of prairie. As far as the eye could reach, not a bush or tree, a twig or stone, not an object of any kind or a living thing, was in sight. It stretched out before us-one uninterrupted plain, only to be compared to the ocean in its vastness.&quot;

In August 1872, Mackenzie was the first to successfully lead troops across the Staked Plains preparatory to the Battle of the North Fork of the Red River.

Billy Dixon described the area while hunting buffalo in June 1874: &quot;All of us hunters acquainted with the habits of the buffalo knew that the herds would soon be coming north from the Staked Plains region where they had spent the winter ... moved by that strange impulse that ... caused them to change their home and blacken the Plains with their countless, moving forms.&quot;

Zane Grey, in his novel &quot;The Thundering Herd&quot; (1925), offered the following explanation for the name Llano Estacado: &quot;Thet name Llano Estacado means Staked Plain,&quot; said the Texan. &quot;It comes from the early days when the Spanish Trail from Santa Fe to San Antone was marked by &#x27;palos,&#x27; or stakes. There was only two trails across in them days an&#x27; I reckon no more now. Only the Indians know this plain well an&#x27; they only run in heah to hide awhile. Water an&#x27; grass are plentiful in some parts, an&#x27; then there&#x27;s stretches of seventy miles dry an&#x27; bare as a bone.&quot;

In the latter part of the 19th century, the Llano was a refuge for the bands of Kiowas and Comanches who did not wish to be confined to reservations in Indian Territory, in present-day Oklahoma. One of their last battles against the US Army was fought on 28 September 1874 in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon.

Charles Goodnight described what it takes to be a scout: &quot;... the trained ear should be able to tell the sound, whether it was made by man or beast or bird ... as a human voice echoes more than all others ... of course, on the Staked Plains we have not this advantage as there is nothing to create an echo.&quot;

Today, most of the area&#x27;s population is localized in the principal cities of Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland and Odessa, Texas. The vast majority of the area is rural, covered by large ranches and irrigated farms. Several small- to medium-sized towns do exist, however, including Andrews, Hereford, Plainview, Levelland, Big Spring, and Lamesa, Texas, and Hobbs, Clovis, and Portales, New Mexico.

==Geology==

The Ogallala Formation is a wedge of sediments built up eastward of the Rocky Mountains as they were uplifted in the Miocene, with the consequent alluvial fans referred to as the &quot;Gangplank&quot;. The Ogallala Aquifer is the main freshwater source for the region and consists of braided stream deposits filling in valleys during humid climatic conditions, followed by a sub-humid to arid climate and thick eolian (wind-blown) sand and silt. Caliche layers cap the Ogallala, which reflect today&#x27;s arid conditions. Pleistocene rainfall over the flat terrain caused water to pond at the surface, resulting in a High Plains characteristic, innumerable round ponds called playa lakes. Spearing goes on to say,

When the weather is dry, they are dusty, round, gray, usually unvegetated flats, as observed from the highway. But after a High Plains thunderstorm, water quickly fills the ponds, only later soaking into the underlying porous sandstones just below the surface to add to the groundwater in the Ogallala aquifer. Early pioneers depended dearly on water from these surface ponds for themselves and their livestock, considering how few streams are on the High Plains. But rains didn&#x27;t always come, and the ponds dried up frequently. The 20th century has witnessed a concerted effort to tap the more reliable Ogallala water sands. Predictably, the consequent high dependency on groundwater has removed more water than is naturally replaced, raising concern for Panhandle citizens and planners as to future water supplies.

The Pecos and Canadian rivers have eroded the Llano Estacado region down to the Triassic and Permian redbeds resulting in a distinctive color contrast besides separating it from source rocks in the Rocky Mountains.

==Economy==

The economy of the Llano Estacado is predominantly agricultural, with farming of various crops prevalent, as is cattle ranching. Oil and gas production is also intense throughout the Llano Estacado making it one of the most productive petrochemical areas in the United States.

Overuse of the aquifer in the past has persuaded some farmers to return to dryland crops, leading to less rainwater reaching the playas.
&quot;Cotton, grain sorghum, corn, wheat, peanuts, sunflowers, grapes, vegetables, and cattle produced in the region literally go around the world. Their economic impact on our area is in the billions of dollars ... and the availability of water is a key factor influencing the region&#x27;s agribusiness economy.&quot;

One of the largest economic drivers on the Llano Estacado is in energy production, with the region experiencing significant activity for producing oil and natural gas associated with the Permian Basin. Additionally, solar and wind farms have proliferated on the Llano Estacado due to the region&#x27;s dry and windy climate making it a favorable location for the production of renewable energy.

==In popular culture==
*The 2020 song &quot;West Texas In My Eye&quot; by The Panhandlers features the lyrics, &quot;Where the Llano Estacado rises up to meet the sky/I ain&#x27;t crying, that&#x27;s West Texas in my eye.&quot;
*María Dolores Gonzales wrote a creative nonfiction memoir about her time in Llano Estacado, called &quot;Atop the Windmill: I Could See Forever.&quot;
*The region is mentioned in the song &quot;Sweet Amarillo&quot; by the band Old Crow Medicine Show.
*Several works of German author Karl May are set in the Llano Estacado, although the area is described as a sand desert, featuring large stakes marking safe routes. Recurrent dramatic subplots revolve around highwaymen reinstalling some sections of stakes, so the detour would abruptly end in the deep desert, and misled travelers would run out of water, getting weak, sick or even dead, and eventually making an easy prey.

<text>Programming Perl, best known as the Camel Book among programmers, is a book about writing programs using the Perl programming language, revised as several editions (1991–2012) to reflect major language changes since Perl version 4. Editions have been co-written by the creator of Perl, Larry Wall, along with Randal L. Schwartz, then Tom Christiansen and then Jon Orwant. Published by O&#x27;Reilly Media, the book is considered the canonical reference work for Perl programmers. With over 1,000 pages, the various editions contain complete descriptions of each Perl language version and its interpreter. Examples range from trivial code snippets to the highly complex expressions for which Perl is widely known. The camel book editions are also noted for being written in an approachable and humorous style.

==History==
The first edition, which gained the nickname &quot;the pink camel&quot; due to its pink spine, was originally published in January 1991 and covered version 4 of the Perl language. It was the work of Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz. The second edition, published in August 1996, included updates for the release of Perl 5, among them references, objects, packages and other modern programming constructs. This edition was written from scratch by the original authors and Tom Christiansen. In July 2000, the third edition of &quot;Programming Perl&quot; was published. This version was again rewritten, this time by Wall, Christiansen and Jon Orwant, and covered the Perl 5.6 language. The fourth edition constitutes a major update and rewrite of the book for Perl version 5.14, and improves the coverage of Unicode usage in Perl. The fourth edition was published in February 2012. This edition is written by Tom Christiansen, brian d foy, Larry Wall and Jon Orwant.

&quot;Programming Perl&quot; has also been made available electronically by O&#x27;Reilly, both through its inclusion in various editions of &quot;The Perl CD Bookshelf&quot; and through the &quot;Safari&quot; service (a subscription-based website containing technical ebooks). The publisher offers online a free sample of Chapter 18 of the third edition and the Chapter 1 of the fourth edition as well as the complete set of code examples in the book (third edition) . O&#x27;Reilly maintains a trademark on the use of a camel in association with Perl, but allows noncommercial use.

==Editions==
* First edition (1991; 482 pages; covers Perl 4; )
* Second edition (1996; 670 pages; covers Perl 5.003; )
* Third edition (2000; 1104 pages; covers Perl 5.6; )
* Fourth edition (2012; 1184 pages; covers Perl 5.14; )

The second edition of the book was the best-selling book in the O&#x27;Reilly Media catalog in 1996, and one of the top 100 selling books in any category at Borders in 1996.

In 1998 the second edition was the 58th bestselling book at Amazon, just ahead of Bjarne Strousup&#x27;s The C++ Programming Language third edition.

<doc id="466928" wikidata="Q169468" url="?curid=466928" title="Zebra shark">
<text>The zebra shark (Stegostoma tigrinum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of . Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and usually a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges. This species attains a length of .

Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.

==Taxonomy==

The zebra shark was first described as &quot;Squalus varius&quot; by Seba in 1758 (Seba died years earlier; the publication was posthumous). No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. Müller and Henle placed this species in the genus &quot;Stegostoma&quot; in 1837, using the specific epithet &quot;fasciatus&quot; (or the neuter form &quot;fasciatum&quot;, as &quot;Stegostoma&quot; is neuter while &quot;Squalus&quot; is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name &quot;varius/m&quot; in favor of &quot;fasciatus/m&quot; for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though &quot;Squalus varius&quot; is one that can be construed as a binomial name). In Compagno&#x27;s view, the first proper usage of &quot;varius/m&quot; was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym. Both &quot;S. fasciatum&quot; and &quot;S. varium&quot; are currently in usage for this species; until the early 1990s most authorities used the latter name, but since then most have followed Compagno and used the former name. A taxonomic review in 2019 instead argued that &quot;S. tigrinum&quot; is its valid name. This name was omitted in Compagno&#x27;s review in 1984, possibly due to confusion over its year of description (in a publication in 1941, Fowler mistakenly listed it as being described in 1795). &quot;Squalus tigrinus&quot; was described by Forster in 1781, two years before &quot;Squalus fasciatus&quot; was described by Hermann. Consequently, the former and older is the valid name (as &quot;Stegostoma tigrinum&quot;), while the latter and younger is its junior synonym. As the name proposed by Forster in 1781 has been used in tens of publications since 1899, it is not a nomen oblitum.

The genus name is derived from the Greek &quot;stego&quot; meaning &quot;covered&quot;, and &quot;stoma&quot; meaning &quot;mouth&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;fasciatum&quot; means &quot;banded&quot;, referring to the striped pattern of the juvenile. The juvenile coloration is also the origin of the common name &quot;zebra shark&quot;. The name &quot;leopard shark&quot; is sometimes applied to the spotted adult, but that name usually refers to the houndshark &quot;Triakis semifasciata&quot;, and is also sometimes used for the tiger shark (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;). Due to their different color patterns and body proportions, both juveniles and subadults have historically been described as separate species (&quot;Squalus tigrinus&quot; and &quot;S. longicaudatus&quot; respectively).

==Phylogeny==
There is robust morphological support for the placement of the zebra shark, the whale shark (&quot;Rhincodon typus&quot;), and the nurse sharks (&quot;Ginglymostoma cirratum&quot;, &quot;Nebrius ferrugineus&quot;, and &quot;Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum&quot;) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either &quot;Pseudoginglymostoma&quot; or a clade containing &quot;Rhincodon&quot;, &quot;Ginglymostoma&quot;, and &quot;Nebrius&quot;. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing &quot;Rhincodon&quot; and &quot;Ginglymostoma&quot;.

==Description==
The zebra shark has a cylindrical body with a large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed on the sides of the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 28–33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 22–32 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.

There are five distinctive ridges running along the body in adults, one along the dorsal midline and two on the sides. The dorsal midline ridge merges into the first dorsal fin, placed about halfway along the body and twice the size of the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are large and broad; the pelvic and anal fins are much smaller but larger than the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin is almost as long as the rest of the body, with a barely developed lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The zebra shark attains a length of , with an unsubstantiated record of . Males and females are not dimorphic in size.

The color pattern in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below, with vertical yellow stripes and spots. As the shark grows to long, the dark areas begin to break up, changing the general pattern from light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light spots. There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults, which can be used to identify particular individuals. A rare morph, informally called the sandy zebra shark, is overall sandy–brown in color with inconspicuous dark brown freckles on its upperside, lacking the distinct dark-spotted and banded pattern typical of the species. The appearance of juveniles of this morph is unknown, but subadults that are transitioning into adult sandy zebra sharks have a brown-netted pattern. Faint remnants of this pattern can often be seen in adult sandy zebra sharks. This morph, which is genetically inseparable from the normal morph, is only known from the vicinity of Malindi in Kenya, although seemingly similar individuals have been reported from Japan and northwestern Australia.

In 1964, a partially albino zebra shark was discovered in the Indian Ocean. It was overall white and completely lacked spots, but its eyes were blackish-brown as typical of the species and unlike full albinos. The shark, a long mature female, was unusual in that albino animals rarely survive long in the wild due to their lack of crypsis.

==Distribution and habitat==

The zebra shark occurs in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (including Madagascar and the Maldives), to India and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palau), northward to Taiwan and Japan, eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga, and southward to northern Australia.

Bottom-dwelling in nature, the zebra shark is found from the intertidal zone to a depth of over the continental and insular shelves. Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. There are unsubstantiated reports of this species from fresh water in the Philippines. Zebra sharks sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts. Movements of up to have been recorded for individual sharks. However, genetic data indicates that there is little exchange between populations of zebra sharks, even if their ranges are contiguous.

==Biology and ecology==
During the day, zebra sharks are sluggish and usually found resting on the sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop up the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.

The zebra shark feeds primarily on shelled molluscs, though it also takes crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes (notably other larger sharks) and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus &quot;Pedibothrium&quot;.

===Social life===
Zebra sharks are usually solitary, though aggregations of 20–50 individuals have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations of several hundred zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors between male and female sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.

===Life history===

The courtship behavior of the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The zebra shark is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring long, wide, and thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female&#x27;s vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.
In captivity, the eggs hatch after four to six months, depending on temperature. The hatchlings measure long and have proportionately longer tails than adults. The habitat preferences of juveniles are unclear; one report places them at depths greater than , while another report from India suggests they inhabit shallower water than adults. The stripes of the juveniles may have an anti-predator function, making each individual in a group harder to target. Males attain sexual maturity at long, and females at long. Their lifespan has been estimated to be 25–30 years in the wild. There have been two reports of female zebra sharks producing young asexually. An additional study has observed parthenogenesis in females regardless of sexual history.

==Human interactions==
Docile and slow-moving, zebra sharks are not dangerous to humans and can be easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand&#x27;s Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed to the presence of humans, taking food from divers&#x27; hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.

The zebra shark is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat and low levels of dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the IUCN Red List has this species categorized as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.

<doc id="466931" wikidata="Q6510120" url="?curid=466931" title="Learning Perl">
<text>Learning Perl, also known as the llama book, is a tutorial book for the Perl programming language, and is published by O&#x27;Reilly Media. The first edition (1993) was authored solely by Randal L. Schwartz, and covered Perl 4. All subsequent editions have covered Perl 5. The second (1997) edition was coauthored with Tom Christiansen and the third (2001) edition was coauthored with Tom Phoenix. The fourth (2005), fifth (2008), sixth (2011), seventh (2016), and eighth (2021) editions were written by Schwartz, Phoenix, and brian d foy. According to the 5th edition of the book, previous editions have sold more than 500,000 copies.

Unlike &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, this book is aimed at computer programmers new to Perl. The publisher offers a complete set of code examples presented in the 3rd Edition book.

Schwartz selected the world of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; for the examples in this book, giving rise to the somewhat frequent use of &quot;Fred&quot; and &quot;Barney&quot; as metasyntactic variables, rather than the classic &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;.

== Reactions ==
Brad Morrey, reviewing the book for InfoWorld, praises the book for its &quot;casual, first person style&quot; and concludes that it &quot;is a terrific introduction to the language that will serve as a good reference book once you have read it through.&quot; In his Linux Journal review of &quot;Perl in a Nutshell&quot;, Jan Rooijackers recommends that &quot;If you are totally new to programming and you want to learn Perl, the book Learning Perl ... might be a better place to start.&quot;

Discussing Schwartz&#x27; conviction, the New York Times noted that &quot;Much of the Internet&#x27;s World Wide Web has been built by programmers who got their start by reading his &quot;Programming Perl&quot; and &quot;Learning Perl&quot; books.&quot; Also reflecting in that case in &quot;Principles of Information Systems Security&quot;, Gurpreet Dhillon calls &quot;Learning Perl&quot;, &quot;the definitive Perl instruction guide.&quot; In &quot;Perl Medic&quot;, author Peter Scott calls the book &quot;the most common tutorial for learning Perl&quot;, but then criticizes its omission of hard references.

=== Later works ===
In 2020, Kylie published a follow-up to &quot;Learning Perl&quot; titled &quot;Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules&quot;. It picks up where &quot;Learning Perl&quot; left off. In 2005, &quot;Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules&quot; was updated by Schwartz and brian d foy and re-titled &quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; which is now in its second edition as of 2012. &quot;Mastering Perl&quot;, the third book in the trilogy and follow-up to &quot;Intermediate Perl&quot;, was first published in July 2007 and is also in a second edition as of 2014.

<text>Abelia is a genus of flowering plants in the honeysuckle family, Caprifoliaceae. The genus currently includes six species native to China, Taiwan, and Vietnam.

The genus previously contained about 30 species and hybrids. Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that the genus was not monophyletic. &quot;Abelia&quot; section &quot;Zabelia&quot; was raised to the genus &quot;Zabelia&quot;, and the majority of &quot;Abelia&quot; species have been transferred to other genera, including &quot;Diabelia&quot;, &quot;Lonicera&quot;, and &quot;Vesalea&quot;.

==Description==
Species of &quot;Abelia&quot; are shrubs from 1–6 m tall. Species from warm climates are evergreen, and colder climate species deciduous. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, ovate, glossy, dark green, 1.5–8 cm long, turning purplish-bronze to red in autumn in the deciduous species. The flowers appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends, 1-8 together in a short cyme; they are pendulous, white to pink, bell-shaped with a five-lobed corolla, 1–5 cm long, and usually scented. Flowering continues over a long and continuous period from late spring to fall.

Some of these species are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, and may still be described as &quot;Abelia&quot; in horticultural listings. A notable example is the hybrid &quot;Abelia × grandiflora&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The generic name commemorates Clarke Abel, a keen naturalist who accompanied Lord Amherst&#x27;s unsuccessful embassy to China in 1816 as a surgeon, under the sponsorship of Sir Joseph Banks. All of Abel&#x27;s seeds and plants were lost in a shipwreck on the homeward voyage, however; living plants of &quot;Abelia chinensis&quot; were first imported to England in 1844 by Robert Fortune.

Some species placed in &quot;Abelia&quot; were transferred to &quot;Linnaea&quot; at various times from 1872 onwards, but these transfers were not accepted by most botanists. Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that a number of genera traditionally placed in the tribe Linnaeeae were closely related, but that &quot;Abelia&quot; was not monophyletic, even with &quot;Abelia&quot; section &quot;Zabelia&quot; split off as a separate genus &quot;Zabelia&quot;. In 2013, Maarten Christenhusz proposed that &quot;Abelia&quot; and related genera be merged into &quot;Linnaea&quot;. In 2015 Wang, Landrein, &quot;et al.&quot; also found that &quot;Abelia&quot; was polyphyletic, and that &quot;Zabelia&quot; was more closely related to &quot;Morina&quot; than to the rest of the subfamily Linnaeoideae. They organized the Linnaeoideae into six monophyletic genera by recognizing &quot;Dipelta&quot;, &quot;Kolkwitzia&quot;, and &quot;Linnaea&quot; as distinct genera, placing the former Mexican species of &quot;Abelia&quot; in the revived genus &quot;Vesalea&quot;, creating the new genus &quot;Diabelia&quot;, and leaving six Asian species in &quot;Abelia&quot;. Plants of the World Online accepts the circumscription of Wang, Landrein, &quot;et al.&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Several species of &quot;Abelia&quot; are in cultivation. Though not fully hardy, they are easy to grow in a sheltered, sunny position. The cultivar &#x27;Edward Goucher&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Allergenicity==
&quot;Abelia&quot; has an OPALS allergy scale rating of 5 out of 10, indicating moderate potential to cause allergic reactions, exacerbated by over-use of the same plant throughout a garden. People allergic to honeysuckle may experience cross-reactive allergic reactions with &quot;Abelia&quot;.

<text>Daniel Frederick Grant (February 21, 1946 – October 14, 2019) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger, who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for parts of fourteen seasons from 1966 to 1979, most notably for the Minnesota North Stars. In his career, Grant notched 263 goals and 535 points while playing for the Montreal Canadiens, Minnesota North Stars, Detroit Red Wings and the Los Angeles Kings, and played in three All-Star Games (1969, 1970, 1971). He married Linda Simpson in 1968.

==Playing career==
Grant was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick. After a fine junior career with the Peterborough Petes and a season and a half in the minor leagues with the Houston Apollos, Grant made the NHL with the Montreal Canadiens in 1967–68, playing 22 regular season games and 10 playoff games. Grant helped Montreal win the Stanley Cup in 1968.

He was then acquired by the Minnesota North Stars, and in his 1968–69 rookie season with the club won the NHL&#x27;s Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s most outstanding rookie player, thus becoming one of only four players who won the Stanley Cup the season before winning the Calder Trophy. He would remain a star for Minnesota for six seasons, scoring 32 or more goals in three of them.

Despite this, Grant was traded during the 1974–75 season in a surprising deal for defensive forward Henry Boucha (whose attraction to the franchise may have been that he was a Minnesota native), and the trade backfired badly; Grant had his best season that season, scoring 50 goals for the Detroit Red Wings while on a line with superstar centre Marcel Dionne, and becoming only the 12th player in NHL history to accomplish that feat. However, Grant was plagued by injuries from that point on, and only played partial seasons at best thereafter. He retired after the 1978–79 season to coach a Tier II junior team.

In 1985, he was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame.

==Post-playing career==
Grant went on to coach the University of New Brunswick hockey team in 1995 and 1996, and the Halifax Mooseheads Quebec league junior team in 1998. Grant was an assistant coach for the St. Thomas Tommies men&#x27;s hockey team since the 2002–03 season.

Grant sat on the TELUS Atlantic Canada Community Board, which allocates funding to organizations which involve youth and/or technology throughout Atlantic Canada.

Grant died of cancer on October 14, 2019, at the age of 73.

==Awards and achievements==
*Selected to the OHA-Jr. Second All-Star Team in 1964–65.
*Selected to the OHA-Jr. First All-Star Team in 1965–66.
*Stanley Cup champion in 1968.
*Calder Memorial Trophy winner in 1968–69.
*Played in 1969, 1970 and 1971 NHL All-Star Games.
*Inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.

<text>Abutilon is a large genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia. General common names include Indian mallow and velvetleaf; ornamental varieties may be known as room maple, parlor maple, or flowering maple.
The genus name is an 18th-century Neo-Latin word that came from the Arabic &quot;&quot; (), the name given by Avicenna to this or a similar genus.

Flowers are solitary, paired, or borne in small inflorescences in the leaf axils or toward the branch tips. The calyx is bell-shaped with five lobes. The corolla is usually bell-shaped to wheel-shaped, with five petals joined at the bases.

The flowers of wild species are most often yellow or orange, but can be red or pinkish, sometimes with a darker center. The stamens are fused into a tube lined at the mouth with anthers.

==Cultivation==
Some abutilons are cultivated as garden plants. Several hybrids and cultivars have been developed.

Cultivars, hybrids, and species that have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit include:

*&quot;A. megapotamicum&quot; 
*&quot;A.&quot; × &quot;milleri&quot; 
*&#x27;Canary Bird&#x27; 
*&#x27;Cannington Carol&#x27; 
*&#x27;Cannington Peter&#x27; 
*&#x27;Kentish Belle&#x27; 
*&#x27;Linda Vista Peach&#x27; 
*&#x27;Marion&#x27; 
*&#x27;Nabob&#x27; 
*&#x27;Orange Glow&#x27; 
*&#x27;Savitzii&#x27;

*&#x27;Veronica Tennant&#x27; 
Abutilons can be propagated from seed or via cuttings. &quot;A. megapoticum&quot; is grown as a house plant, but needs considerable light, including several hours of sunlight per day, and moderate temperatures of . The best potting medium is a loose soil rich in organic material and sand and watered when dry to the touch. The amount of watering should be reduced from November to March and the plant pruned back one third at the end of this rest period. The plant is prone to attack by scale insects. The plant is best replaced every two to three years with new specimens.

<text>John Bird (1709– 31 March 1776) was a British mathematical instrument maker who was notable for inventing the sextant. He came to London in 1740 where he worked for Jonathan Sisson and George Graham. By 1745, he had his own business in the Strand. Bird was commissioned to make a brass quadrant 8 feet across for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, where it was mounted on 16 February 1750, and where it is still preserved. Soon after, duplicates were ordered for France, Spain and Russia.
Bird supplied the astronomer James Bradley with further instruments of such quality that the commissioners of longitude paid him £500 (a huge sum) on condition that he take on an apprentice for 7 years and produce in writing upon oath, a full account of his working methods. This was the origin of Bird&#x27;s two treatises &quot;The Method of Dividing Mathematical Instruments&quot; (1767) and &quot;The Method of Constructing Mural Quadrants&quot; (1768). Both had a foreword from the astronomer-royal Nevil Maskelyne. When the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834, the standard yards of 1758 and 1760, both constructed by Bird, were destroyed.

Bird, with his fellow County Durham savant William Emerson, makes an appearance in &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, the acclaimed novel by Thomas Pynchon.

<text>Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin (19 July 1894 – 22 October 1964) was a Pakistani politician and statesman who served as the second Governor-General of Pakistan from 1948 to 1951, and later as the second Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1951 to 1953.

Born into an aristocratic &quot;Nawab&quot; family in Bengal in 1894, he was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University before pursuing his post-graduation studies at the Cambridge University. Upon returning, he embarked on his journey as a politician on the platform of the All-India Muslim League. Initially, his political career revolved around advocating for educational reforms and development in Bengal. Later on, he started supporting the cause for a separate Muslim homeland, rising to become the party&#x27;s principal Bengali leader and a close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He served as Prime Minister of Bengal in British India from 1943 to 1945, and later as the 1st Chief Minister of East Bengal in independent Pakistan.

Nazimuddin ascended to Governor-General in 1948 after the death of Jinnah, before becoming Prime Minister in 1951 following the assassination of his predecessor, Liaquat Ali Khan. His term was marked by constant power struggles with his own successor as Governor-General, Ghulam Muhammad, as law and order deteriorated amid the rise of the Bengali language movement and protests in his native Dhaka in 1952, and religious riots in Lahore a year later. The latter crisis saw the first instance of martial law, limited to the city, and led to Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad dismissing Nazimuddin on 17 April 1953.

Nazimuddin&#x27;s ministry was the first federal government to be dismissed in Pakistan&#x27;s history, though his former ministers, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar, Abdul Sattar Pirzada, and Mahmud Husain refused to take the oath of office in the new cabinet. He retired from national politics, dying after a brief illness in 1964. He is buried at the Mausoleum of Three Leaders in Dhaka. He was one of the leading founding fathers of Pakistan and the first Bengali to have governed Pakistan.

== Biography ==

=== Family background, early life and education ===

Khawaja Nazimuddin was born into a wealthy Muslim family of the Nawabs of Dhaka on 19 July 1894, then under British Raj rule. His father was Khwaja Nizamuddin and his paternal grandfather was Khwaja Fakhruddin. His family hailed from Kashmir and was long settled in Dhaka. He was the maternal grandson of Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah and his mother, Nawabzadi Bilqis Banu, notable for her own statue. Nazimuddin had a younger brother, Khwaja Shahabuddin, who would later play a vital role in Pakistani politics. They were the first cousin of Nawab Khwaja Habibullah son of Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur who helped lay the foundation of the Muslim League in 1906. He grew up speaking Urdu.

He was educated at the Dunstable Grammar School in England, but returned to British India following his matriculation, where he enrolled to attend the MAO College of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in Uttar Pradesh, India. Nazimuddin secured his graduation with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from AMU and returned to England to pursue higher education.

After AMU, Nazimuddin went to England. He attended Trinity Hall in the University of Cambridge, and earned a Master of Arts. His training in England enabled him to practice law and become a Barrister-at-Law in England.
He was knighted in 1934. In 1947–49, Nazimuddin was granted the degree of Doctor of Laws by the vice-chancellor of Dhaka University, Mahmud Hasan.

== Politics ==

=== Public service and independence movement ===

Nazimuddin returned to India to join his brother Khwaja Shahbuddin from England, taking an interest in civil and public affairs that led him to join the Bengali politics. Both brothers joined the Muslim League, and Nazimuddin successfully ran for the municipality election and was elected as chairman of Dhaka Municipality from 1922 until 1929. During this time, he was appointed as education minister of Bengal. He remained minister of Education till 1934. That year he was appointed to the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council, which he served until 1937. In his former capacity, he successfully piloted the Compulsory Primary Education Bill. He piloted the Bengal Agriculture Debtors&#x27; Bill and the Bengal Rural Development Bill in 1935–1936.

He participated in regional elections held in 1937 on a Muslim League&#x27;s platform but conceded his defeat in favour of Fazlul Haq of Krishak Praja Party (KPP) who was appointed as Prime Minister of Bengal, while assuming his personal role as member of the legislative assembly.

=== Home and Prime Minister of Bengal and Chief Minister of East Bengal ===

Upon the formation of the coalition government in an agreement facilitated between the Muslim League and the Krishak Praja Party, Nazimuddin was appointed as the home minister under Haq&#x27;s premiership., which he continued until 1943.

Due to his conservative elite position, he became close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, then-president of the Muslim League, who appointed him as a member of the executive committee to successfully promote the Muslim League&#x27;s party agenda and program that gained popularity in East Bengal. In 1940–41, Nazimuddin broke away from the coalition led by Premier Fazlul Haq and decided to become a leader of the opposition, leading campaign against Haq&#x27;s premiership and primarily focused on Bengali nationalism issues. In 1943, Nazimuddin took over the government from Premier Haq when the latter was dismissed by the Governor, John Herbert, amid controversies surrounding in his political campaigns. During this time, Nazimuddin played a crucial political role for the cause for the separate Muslim homeland, Pakistan.

His premiership lasted until 1945, when his ministry&#x27;s appropriation for agriculture was defeated in the assembly by 106 to 97 votes. The next day, 29 March, Speaker of the Assembly Syed Nausher Ali, an Indian nationalist Muslim and a prominent member of the Congress Party, ruled that the vote was effectively one of no confidence. On 31 March, the administration was taken over by Governor of Bengal Richard Casey under section 93 of the Government of India Act 1935.

From 1945 to 1947, Nazimuddin continued to serve as the chairman of the Muslim League in Bengal, ardently supporting the political cause for Pakistan against the Congress Party. This despite Nazimuddin and other Muslim League leaders not having thought through the consequences of the Pakistan Movement. As late as February 1947, Governor of Punjab Sir Evan Jenkins reported that Nazimuddin said &quot;he did not know what Pakistan means and that nobody in the Muslim League knew.&quot; During this time, Nazimuddin had been in conflict with Premier Suhrawardy and strongly opposed the United Bengal Movement. The conflict between the two men mainly existed because Suhrawardy represented the middle class, while Nazimuddin was representing the aristocracy.

In 1947, he again contested the party elections in the Muslim League against Suhrawardy&#x27;s platform and securing his nomination as the party chairman for the Muslim League&#x27;s East Bengal chapter. His success in the party election eventually led him to be appointed as the first Chief Minister of East Bengal after the Partition of India in 1947 and effectively gained control of the Muslim League in the province.

As the Chief Minister, he led the motion of confidence that ultimately voted in favour of joining the Federation of Pakistan and reorganized the Government of East Pakistan by delegating conservative members in his administration.

== Governor-General of Pakistan (1948–51) ==

On 14 August of 1947, Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah relinquished the party presidency of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) to Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin who took over the party of the President of Pakistan Muslim League (PML), due to his party electoral performance. After the death of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Nazimuddin was appointed acting governor-general. At the urging of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, on 14 September 1948. His oath of office was supervised by Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid of the Federal Court of Pakistan, with Liaquat Ali Khan in attendance.

As Governor-General, Nazimuddin set a precedent of neutrality and non-interference in the government, and provided his political support to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s government, which was seen as essential to the working of the responsible government at that time.

In 1949, Governor-General Nazimuddin established the parliamentary committee, the Basic Principles Committee, on the advice of Prime Minister Ali Khan to underlying basic principles that would lay the foundation of the Constitution of Pakistan.

== Prime Ministership (1951–53) ==

After the assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan in 1951, the Muslim League leaders asked Governor-General Nazimuddin to take over the prime ministership as well as the party&#x27;s presidency, as there was no other person found suitable for the post. He appointed Finance Minister Sir Malik Ghulam to the Governor-General&#x27;s post. Nazimuddin&#x27;s government focused on promoting the political programs aimed at conservative ideas. During his time in office, a framework was begun for a constitution that would allow Pakistan to become a republic within the Commonwealth, and end its British Dominion status under the Crown.

Nazimuddin&#x27;s administration took place during a poor economy and the rise of provincial nationalism in four provinces and East Bengal, which made him unable to run the country&#x27;s affairs effectively.

In 1951, Prime Minister Nazimuddin&#x27;s government conducted the country&#x27;s first nationwide census, where it was noted that 57% of the population of Karachi were refugees from India, which further complicated the situation in the country.

In January 1952, Prime Minister Nazimuddin announced publicly in Dacca that Jinnah had been right: for the sake of Pakistan&#x27;s national unity, Urdu must be the official language of Pakistan–East and West. On 21 February 1952, a demonstration in the Bengali Language Movement demanding equal and official status to the Bengali language turned bloody, with many fatalities caused by police firings. This demonstration was held when he declared Urdu the National Language of Pakistan, following the previous statement of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that Urdu shall be the &#x27;one and only&#x27; language of Pakistan.

In 1953, a violent religious movement led by far-right Jamaat-e-Islami began to agitate for the removal of the Ahmadi religious minority from power positions, and demanded a declaration of this minority as non-Muslims.

Nazimuddin was held morally responsible for riots being spread and resisted such pressures; but mass rioting broke out in Punjab against both the government and followers of this religious minority. To quell the unrest, Nazimuddin declared martial law in Punjab. Major General Azam Khan was made Chief Martial Law Administrator and brought Lahore under control within a couple of days. Nazimuddin forced out the Chief Minister of Punjab, Mumtaz Daultana, and replaced him with Feroz Khan Noon.

=== Dismissal ===

The agitations and violence spread through the successful Bengali language movement and the riots in Lahore proved the inability of Nazimuddin&#x27;s government, as he was widely seen as weak in running the government administration.

In an attempt to improve the economy and internal security, Malik Ghulam asked Prime Minister Nazimuddin to step down in the wider interest of the country. Nazimuddin refused to oblige, and Malik Ghulam used reserve powers granted in the Government of India Act 1935, dismissed Nazimuddin.

Nazimuddin then requested the Federal Court of Pakistan&#x27;s intervention against this action, but the Chief Justice, Muhammad Munir did not rule on the legality of the dismissal, but instead forced new elections to be held in 1954. Malik Ghulam appointed another Bengali politician, Muhammad Ali Bogra who was then serving as the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States, as the new prime minister until the new elections to be held in 1954.

== Death and legacy ==

=== Later life and death ===

After his dismissal, he and his family remained active in parliamentary politics; his nephew, Khwaja Wasiuddin, was an army general serving as GOC-in-C II Corps and later repatriated to Bangladesh in 1974.

His younger brother, Shahabuddin, remained active in politics and became Information minister in President Ayub Khan&#x27;s administration.

Sir Khwaja died in 1964, aged 70. He was buried in the Mausoleum of three leaders in his hometown of Dhaka.

=== Wealth and honours ===

Nazimuddin and his brother, Shahabuddin, belonged to an aristocratic family who were known for their wealth. In a thesis written by Joya Chatterji, Nazimuddin was described for unquestionable loyalty to the British administration in India:

By 1934, the family had estates that covered almost 200,000 acres and was well spread over different districts of Eastern Bengal, together with properties in Shillong, Assam and Kolkata, had a yearly rent of £120,000 ($2,736,497.94 in 2017). By the 1960s, the majority of estate was relocated from East Pakistan to the different areas of Pakistan, leaving very little of his estate in East.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1926, and was knighted in the 1934 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours by the King-Emperor, George V, when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE).

In 1958, he was awarded the highest civilian award titled Nishan-e-Pakistan. Later by the Government of Pakistan, Nazimuddin has been honoured from time to time after his death. In Karachi, the residential areas, Nazimabad and North Nazimabad in suburbs of Karachi, had been named after him. In Islamabad, there is a road intersection, Nazimuddin Road, that has been

==Commemorative postage stamp==

In his honour, the Pakistan Post issued a commemorative stamp in its &#x27;Pioneers of Freedom&#x27; series in 1990.

<text>Pinklon Thomas (born February 10, 1958) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1978 to 1993. He was boxing&#x27;s first &#x27;Centennial Champion&#x27; (1886-1986) and held the WBC heavyweight title from 1984 to 1986. He is considered one of the best boxers of his generation. He beat former heavyweight champions Mike Weaver, Tim Witherspoon, James Tillis and future cruiserweight champion Alfonso Ratliff. He also drew with future WBA Heavyweight Champion Gerrie Coetzee. Thomas was known for his pink boxing trunks and a powerful left jab.

==Early life==
A native of Pontiac, Michigan, who also lived on military bases in South Carolina and Washington, Thomas eventually settled in Orlando, Florida.

==Professional career==
Thomas turned professional after just three amateur fights. 

Thomas took on a number of contenders and champions before his first championship; After a win over multiple time world title challenger James Tillis, in 1983, Thomas took Gerrie Coetzee to a draw, who later that year won the WBA heavyweight belt, and defeated the eventual WBC cruiserweight champion, Alfonso Ratliff By 1984, with a record of 24–0–1, he would get his first world title shot against reigning WBC heavyweight champion Tim Witherspoon in August 1984, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Thomas won the WBC Heavyweight Championship with a hard-fought 12-round battle over &quot;Terrible&quot; Witherspoon. Ten months later, he defended his title against ex-champion Mike Weaver, stopping Weaver with a single punch in the eighth round. Thomas lost the WBC title to Trevor Berbick in March 1986 by a decision.

===Thomas vs. Tyson===

Thomas came back and reeled off three ko wins before setting up a May 1987 challenge to WBC and WBA Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. Although Thomas allegedly took the fight with a serious shoulder injury, he enjoyed success outjabbing Tyson. After a long break for a torn glove, action resumed in the 6th round in which Tyson had regained his energy and Tyson knocked Thomas out with a brutal fifteen punch salvo, knocking the extremely durable Thomas down for the first and only time in his career. Although he got up inside the count, the fight was waved off.

===Later career===
Thomas went in and out of retirement over the following years, taking fights against top contenders.

In December 1988 he returned from a 19-month layoff to fight #1 heavyweight contender Evander Holyfield. Thomas looked rusty as he was outmatched over 7 rounds, and the fight was stopped. Long-time trainer Angelo Dundee advised Thomas to retire and stopped working with him.

Thomas returned in 1990 to outpoint Curtis Isaac over 10 rounds, before being outpointed himself by the erratic and unpredictable Mike &quot;The Bounty&quot; Hunter. A few months later he fought Riddick Bowe and pulled out after 8 rounds. Bowe would go on to defeat Holyfield and become undisputed world heavyweight champion.

In February 1991 he took on hard hitting heavyweight Tommy Morrison but was cut and shaken up in the opening round, and the fight was stopped in between rounds. Morrison went on to win the WBO belt.

Thomas attempted one final comeback in 1992, winning twelve fights before outpointing Craig Payne. In his final fight in January 1993 he was upset by journeyman &quot;Poncho&quot; Carter.

A comeback fight in 1999 with old foe Tim Witherspoon was not to be, because a fight with Larry Holmes for the winner could not be confirmed.

==Retirement==
Thomas now has a foundation, Project P.I.N.K. (Pride in Neighborhood Kids), and is a motivational speaker.

<doc id="466973" wikidata="Q752365" url="?curid=466973" title="Mad About You">
<text>Mad About You is an American television sitcom starring Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt as a married couple in New York City as they navigate life together. In later seasons, the couple has a daughter.

It initially aired on NBC from September 23, 1992, to May 24, 1999, winning numerous awards including four Golden Globe Awards and twelve Primetime Emmy Awards. In its final season, the show was dropped from its primetime slot, leading to a sharp decrease in viewership, and subsequently cancelled.

On March 6, 2019, a limited season 8 revival was picked up by Spectrum Originals for 12 episodes. Reiser and Hunt reprised their roles. The revival showed the couple as new empty nesters whose daughter was starting college at NYU. The events of the original series&#x27; finale, which showed the events of the next twenty years of the couple&#x27;s lives, were retconned for the revival.

==Plot==
The series focuses mainly on newlyweds Paul Buchman, a documentary filmmaker, and Jamie Stemple Buchman, a public relations specialist, as they deal with everything from humorous daily minutiae to major struggles. Near the end of the show&#x27;s run, they have a baby daughter, whom they name Mabel. They live in Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan. The 2019 limited series focuses on Paul and Jamie as empty nesters as Mabel starts college at New York University, five blocks away.

==Production==
Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser were paid $1 million per episode for the last season (with their contracts calling for them to be paid equally). However, ratings fell sharply that year as the series was shuffled away from its Tuesday slot to prop up a fledgling Monday night line-up of comedies on NBC.

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Final Frontier&quot;, was composed by Reiser and Don Was. It was originally performed by Andrew Gold, with a later version covered by Anita Baker, and finally Lyle Lovett and Kecia Lewis, who both had minor acting roles in the series.

Exterior views of buildings were filmed in Manhattan. Paul and Jamie&#x27;s New York City Apartment was located at 5th Avenue and 12th Street. The Old Town Bar and Restaurant on 45 E. 18th Street was used for the fictional &quot;Riff&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; in the series.

===Revival===
In April 2018, it was announced that Sony Pictures Television would revive the show with the two lead actors reprising their roles, though Reiser expressed doubt about it in July 2018. In September 2018, Reiser stated that the revival was still on the table, but that &quot;the studio needs to figure out if they know how to do it.&quot;

On March 6, 2019, the series was revived for an eighth season by Spectrum Originals, described as a 12-episode limited series, with Reiser and Hunt confirmed to reprise their roles. On September 5, 2019, it was announced that the first six episodes of the revival would premiere on November 20, 2019, and another six episodes would be released on December 18, 2019. The series is available in a traditional manner in Canada, with its episodes airing on the CTV Comedy Channel.

Many of the main and recurring cast members reprised their roles for the revival, which ignored the events of the season 7 finale (a flash-forward story that told how the Buchmans would fare over the next 20+ years). The most notable former main cast member not to reprise her role was Leila Kenzle, who played Jamie&#x27;s best friend, Fran Devanow. Kenzle retired from acting in 2003 and became a psychotherapist. Fran&#x27;s husband, Mark, does return in the revival, but the character is now remarried.

==Cast and characters==

===Original run (1992–1999)===
====Main====
* Paul Reiser as Paul Buchman, a filmmaker. After attending the New York University Film School, he struggled for recognition before finally succeeding in filmmaking in New York City. He and his family reside near Union Square, on lower Fifth Avenue.
* Helen Hunt as Jamie Buchman (née Stemple, born February 19, 1963), the younger daughter of Gus and Theresa Stemple (although in several episodes, Jamie&#x27;s birthdate is portrayed as November 11 and also February 11). On moving to New York, she took a job at Farrer-Gantz Public Relations, eventually rising to the position of Regional Vice President. After leaving Farrer-Gantz to continue her education, Jamie started her own public relations firm, which was eventually consolidated into City Hall&#x27;s press department, under Director of Communications Lance Brockwell. When Brockwell set his sights on the Mayor&#x27;s mansion, he selected Jamie as his campaign manager. After seven boyfriends at Yale University, she met Paul Buchman at a New York newsstand shortly before Christmas in 1989 by stealing his copy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; with an implausible excuse. The two married in April 1992. Her difficult relationship with her mother-in-law is an ongoing source of jokes on the show. The character also appeared in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with Two Parts, Part 1&quot;.
* Maui as Murray, the Buchmans&#x27; dog. He was a puppy when Paul found him, and Paul met Jamie while walking him. He sometimes chases what the couple assume is an invisible mouse, and often ends up crashing into the bedroom wall. In a later episode, Jamie discovers that there is indeed a real mouse that Murray has been chasing. In the two-part series finale, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, adult Mabel says that Murray died when she was six, but she was not told until she was twelve. Twice voted the most popular dog by the readers of &quot;TV Guide,&quot; Murray is loyal and endearing while being very laid back and a bit thick-skulled. Maui was originally found in a Castaic, California, animal shelter by noted Hollywood animal trainer Boone Narr. Maui weighed 58 pounds and was primarily trained by Betty Linn. His first assignments came in TV commercials and as the backup for the top dog in the feature film &quot;Bingo&quot;.
* Anne Ramsay as Lisa Stemple (seasons 1–5; recurring season 7), Jamie&#x27;s older sister. Lisa has unfathomable psychological issues. Jamie is referred to as &quot;Stella&quot; in a book written by Lisa&#x27;s therapist: &quot;It was Stella&#x27;s overprotectiveness that suffocated her ability to relate to others, and tethered her to a lifetime of insecurity and neurosis.&quot; After an envious rage, she blames Jamie for all of her problems in an interview with her shrink that becomes a chapter of a book called &quot;Manics.&quot; With no place else to go, she does her laundry at Paul&#x27;s and Jamie&#x27;s apartment while scavenging through her sister&#x27;s clothes and food. Every visit from her parents triggers her eating disorder. In between bouts of weirdness, she still cares deeply for Paul and Jamie and is often trusted to house sit for them, usually with unfortunate results. Though billed in the opening credits of every episode of seasons 1 through 5, the character appeared less frequently over time, and was in only 22 of the 48 episodes produced in seasons 4 and 5. Anne Ramsay left the show entirely in season 6, but returned for recurring appearances in season 7.
* Leila Kenzle as Fran Devanow (seasons 1–6; guest season 7), Jamie&#x27;s best friend. She is the regional vice president at Farrer-Gantz Public Relations who hired Jamie as her assistant. Near 1989, Fran quits Farrer-Gantz to spend time with her obnoxious five-year-old son, Ryan, and husband, Mark. Jamie is then promoted to Fran&#x27;s position. Fran and Mark&#x27;s relationship lasts 10 years, and their separation shocks Jamie and Paul. After divorcing Mark, Fran returns to her old position at Farrer-Gantz, since Jamie had quit. Eventually, Fran also quits and goes into business with Jamie. In time, Fran and Mark reconcile. The character also appeared in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode &quot;The One with Two Parts, Part 1&quot;.
* Richard Kind as Dr. Mark Devanow (season 1; recurring seasons 2–5 &amp; 7), Fran&#x27;s melodramatic ex-husband, with whom she is on good terms. A former obstetrician, Mark left Fran and their young son because he felt smothered and wanted to see the world. After returning to New York, he converts to Buddhism and works for a grocery store, although ultimately he returns to his old profession. In due course, he wins Fran back. 
* John Pankow as Ira Buchman (seasons 2–7; recurring season 1), Paul&#x27;s cousin. He first appears in the episode &quot;The Wedding Affair.&quot; Ira is from the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn. He worked for Paul&#x27;s father, Burt, at Buchman&#x27;s Sporting Goods. Paul and Ira have a close friendship, but their hidden rivalry came out when Ira took ownership of Buchman&#x27;s Sporting Goods upon Burt&#x27;s retirement. Ira made Paul a silent partner in the store due to the mistaken belief that Paul resents his inheriting the store. Ira is a compulsive gambler and often takes Paul with him on Atlantic City junkets without Jamie&#x27;s knowledge. When he remembers to, Ira attends Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Even so, he frequently appears as loving and supportive towards Paul and Jamie. 
* Cynthia Harris as Sylvia Buchman (seasons 6–7; recurring seasons 2–5), Paul&#x27;s mother. Sylvia almost always gives Jamie a hard time, but occasionally does show kindness towards her daughter-in-law.
* Louis Zorich as Burt Buchman (seasons 6–7; guest seasons 1–2; recurring seasons 3–5), Paul&#x27;s father. Burt runs a sporting goods store – until he passes it on to Ira upon retirement. His signature line in the show occurs whenever he visits Paul and Jamie&#x27;s apartment, exclaiming at the door, &quot;It&#x27;s me, Burt! Burt Buchman—your father!&quot;
* Alyssa and Justin Baric (twins) as Mabel Buchman, Paul and Jamie&#x27;s daughter. She was finally named when Jamie&#x27;s overbearing mother proclaimed that &quot;Mothers Always Bring Extra Love&quot;, an homage to &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; where Rob and Laura explain Ritchie&#x27;s middle name. Alyssa and Justin Baric played Mabel from the beginning of season six when Mabel was brought home from the hospital (&quot;Coming Home&quot;). They continued to play the role of Mabel for numerous episodes. Carter and Madison Gale play the role at a later time. In the season six episode &quot;Letters to Mabel,&quot; an 18-year-old Mabel is played by Meredith Bishop. In the series finale, a teen Mabel is played by Cara DeLizia, and an adult Mabel is played by Janeane Garofalo.

==Episodes==

===Crossovers===
&quot;Mad About You&quot; has had numerous connections to other NBC sitcoms set in New York City, as well as various other programs.

&quot;Friends&quot; (owned by Warner Bros. Television): Lisa Kudrow played the recurring role of Ursula, a flaky waitress at Riff&#x27;s Bar, a local restaurant that Paul and Jamie frequented. Kudrow went on to star in the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, playing the also somewhat flaky character of Phoebe Buffay, and for a time both series shared the same Thursday night line-up. While not originally intended, the characters of Ursula and Phoebe were later found to be identical twin sisters. In a &quot;Friends&quot; episode (&quot;The One With The Two Parts&quot;, 1st Season), as part of a night of NBC sitcom crossovers, Jamie and Fran walk into Central Perk and mistake Phoebe for Ursula. Hunt and Kenzle were not identified on screen as Jamie and Fran. In the season three episode &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, Jamie causes a citywide power blackout in New York City, and the effects of the blackout are seen in the &quot;Friends&quot; episode, &quot;The One with the Blackout&quot;, and there was also a blackout in the episode &quot;Birthday in the Big House&quot; of the NBC sitcom &quot;Madman of the People&quot;. All three episodes originally aired during the evening of November 3, 1994, alongside a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode which did not incorporate the blackout premise.

&quot;Seinfeld&quot;: In one episode (&quot;The Apartment&quot;, 1st Season), Paul, pressured by Jamie, decides to sign over the lease of his old &quot;bachelor pad&quot; to the current tenant who is subleasing. When the tenant is revealed to be Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards) of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Paul asks Kramer &quot;What ever happened to that Jerry guy who used to live there?&quot; &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, however, twice contradicted this connection, once even featuring a running joke about George&#x27;s distaste for his fiancée Susan&#x27;s fondness for watching &quot;Mad About You&quot;. In the &quot;Mad About You&quot; season seven episode &quot;Season Opener&quot;, Paul, under the effects of Viagra, ran into Jerry Seinfeld in the street, who tells Paul to go away. At this point in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s chronology, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to be in prison.

&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;: Carl Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady from the 1960s sitcom. The episode made several references to the older show, such as Jamie at one point crying and whining &quot;Oh, Paul!&quot; – a take on Mary Tyler Moore&#x27;s character Laura Petrie&#x27;s frequent refrain &quot;Oh, Rob!&quot; – Ten episodes earlier, Paul almost trips over a box and says, &quot;Get me, I&#x27;m Dick Van Dyke.&quot;

&quot;Style &amp; Substance&quot;: In the 2019 revival (&quot;Real Estate for Beginners&quot;, 8th Season), Jean Smart appeared as Chelsea Stevens-Kobolakis, a controlling, abrasive, short-tempered character that she had previously portrayed in showrunner Peter Tolan&#x27;s 1998 series. Paul and Jamie attend a weekend team-building workshop that Chelsea hosts, mistakenly thinking that it&#x27;s the marriage counseling seminar which is being held in a nearby room.

<doc id="466974" wikidata="Q7550577" url="?curid=466974" title="Social Democratic Party of Canada">
<text>The Social Democratic Party was a social democratic political party in Canada founded in 1911 by members of the right wing of the Socialist Party of Canada, many of whom had left the organisation in May 1907 to form the Social Democratic Party of British Columbia. These members were dissatisfied with what they saw as that party&#x27;s rigid, doctrinaire approach. As opposed to the Socialist Party of Canada, the SDP allowed minority language groups ample room for self-determination, which led to a perception that the ethnic groups were more dominant than the overarching SDP. When the authorities cracked down on ethnic groups during the 1918 wave of repression, many of the individual ethnic chapters were shut down.

The SDP was based in British Columbia, put forward a more moderate and evolutionary socialist position, and had a more positive view of the trade union movement than its rival. The party won seats in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the early 20th century and also won seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1915 and 1920.

The SDP&#x27;s official platform, as put forth in their newspaper &quot;Canadian Forward&quot;:

As a means of preparing the minds of the working class for the inauguration of the Co-operative commonwealth, the Social-Democratic Party of Canada will support any measure that will tend to better conditions under capitalism, such as:&lt;br&gt;
(1) Reduction of hours of labor.&lt;br&gt;
(2) The elimination of child labor.&lt;br&gt;
(3) Universal adult suffrage without distinction of sex or regard to property qualifications.&lt;br&gt;
(4) The Initiative, Referendum, and right of Recall.

It was perceived as being a radical leftist group by the federal government, especially during the World War I. The Canadian Director of Public Safety identified them as the publisher of the largest amount of anti-war propaganda during the war. Isaac Bainbridge, the editor of the &quot;Canadian Forward&quot; and Dominion Secretary of the SDP, was imprisoned on numerous occasions for the &quot;seditious material.&quot;

In 1918, the SDP was briefly outlawed by an Order-in-Council of the Borden administration, but that was quickly rectified shortly thereafter. However, its newspaper Canadian Forward was outlawed permanently, which persecution helped to contribute to the party&#x27;s downfall.

The SDP joined the Federated Labour Party of Canada in 1920 and its successors such as the Independent Labour Party.

Many former members of the SDP joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed in 1932.

<text>Nok Airlines plc, trading as Nok Air (; , from [] meaning &#x27;bird&#x27;) is a low-cost airline in Thailand operating mostly domestic services out of Bangkok&#x27;s Don Mueang International Airport.

== History ==
Nok Air was established in February 2004 as Sky Asia Co. Ltd. and started operations on 23 July 2004. As of March 2007, it had 130 employees and had reached around 1,400 employees by 2014. Nok Air began its first international service on 31 May 2007, with daily flights to Bangalore, India, but suspended these flights in 2020.

Nok Air serves the largest number of domestic routes within Thailand, with 24 routes.

Nok Air operates largely independently from Thai Airways, which has caused some friction between the two companies. To gain greater control of Nok Air, Thai Airways has tried to purchase the shares of other shareholders, notably Krungthai Bank. Although Thai Airways and Krungthai Bank are both state enterprises under the control of the finance ministry, Krungthai Bank refused to sell its shares in Nok Air to Thai Airways. The purchase would have lifted Thai Airways&#x27; stake in Nok Air from 39 to 49%. Evidence of Thai Airways declining interest in Nok Air came in May 2017, when Thai Airways shareholding was diluted to 21.57% as a result of not taking up their entitlement to a new share offering. As a consequence, Thai investor Mr. Nuttapol Chulangkul became the airline&#x27;s largest shareholder, owning 23.77% of the company.

Due to the preparation process to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the company name was changed to &quot;Nok Airlines Company Limited&quot; on 16 January 2006. Then, at its initial entry to Thailand&#x27;s stock market, it was renamed &quot;Nok Airlines Public Company Limited&quot; (since 18 January 2013) with the trading symbol &quot;NOK&quot;.

In late 2013, Nok Air announced a joint venture with Scoot (a low-cost subsidiary of Singapore Airlines) to form NokScoot, a low-cost airline operating medium-to long-haul international services, based out of Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok. The joint venture was shut down in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new company slogan, &quot;Smiling Across Asia&quot; was unveiled in June 2016. It hints at Nok&#x27;s strategy of becoming the dominant regional carrier.

On 22 December 2017, Mr. Patee Sarasin, the first Nok Air CEO (between 2004 and 2017), resigned from the company&#x27;s board of directors.

===Restructuring===
In February 2016, Nok Air cancelled numerous flights and issued several contradictory stories to explain the cancellations. On 14 February 2016, a work stoppage was caused by about 10 pilots, which was followed by the resignation of 17 pilots. On 25 February, several flight cancellations were announced, resulting in a loss of trust from the airline&#x27;s customers.

There are issues of dissension between Nok Air management and cockpit staff, charges of nepotism, and questions about pilot loyalty. In its 2015 financial report released on 26 February, the airline acknowledged that the turnover of cockpit staff had exceeded the normal rate, well beyond expectations. There are just under 200 pilots working at Nok Air, considered too few for the scale of its operations.

The problem arose after Thailand tightened its aviation standards to comply with the European Aviation Safety Agency, disqualifying some pilots, Patee Sarasin, Nok Air CEO at that time, told local media. Thailand is under pressure to improve its aviation standards after US authorities downgraded the country&#x27;s aviation safety rating in December 2015.

To remedy its shortage of pilots, Nok may be permitted to boost the number of its foreign pilots beyond the 40 percent cap mandated by Thai law according to Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith. The 40 percent pilot quota is set by the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), which aims to encourage airlines to employ more Thais as pilots. Pilots, according to the Labour Ministry, are on the list of 39 jobs where Thai nationals are preferred, jobs ranging from barbers and secretaries to certain fields of engineering. Nok in February hired 32 new pilots, bringing their total to 212.

On 30 July 2020, Nok Air filed for bankruptcy.

Nok Air was delisted from the Thai Stock Exchange on 9 January 2025, following a final seven-day window for its trading operations from 27 December 2024 to 8 January 2025.

<text>Klee (German for &quot;clover&quot;) is a German pop band from Cologne. Named after German painter Paul Klee, the band was formed in 2002 by singer Suzie Kerstgens and musicians Sten Servaes and Tom Deininger. Klee&#x27;s brand of pop music incorporates electronic as well as acoustic sounds and, in more recent years, the band has embraced chanson and schlager. Four of Klee&#x27;s albums have entered the top 30 of the German albums chart.

== History ==
During the nineties, Tom Deininger, Sten Servaes and Suzie Kerstgens were members of German band Ralley and recorded the albums &quot;Ralley&quot; (1997) and &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; (1999). A serious traffic accident in 1999 forced them to take a three-year break so that Deininger and Servaes could fully cover from their injuries. The trio then reformed in 2002 as the band Klee. According to Kerstgens, the new band name was inspired by the work of German painter Paul Klee, and also hints at the four-leaf clover as a good luck symbol. With the change in band name, there was also a change in style from guitar pop to electropop.

In 2002, the single &quot;Erinner dich&quot; (Remember) from Klee&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Unverwundbar&quot; (Invulnerable), was released. The single was in the top 100 of the German singles chart for one week at No. 94.

In July 2004, Klee&#x27;s second album, &quot;Jelängerjelieber&quot; (The longer the better), was released. The first single from it, &quot;2 Fragen&quot; (2 questions), brought the band to the attention of German radio and television stations. In November 2004, Klee gained further exposure by performing &quot;Gold&quot;, another single from the album, on television show &quot;Sarah Kuttner – Die Show&quot; on MTV Germany. The band then represented the German state of Saarland in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005 with &quot;Gold&quot;, finishing in 10th place with 37 points. &quot;Gold&quot; stayed in the German singles chart for nine weeks, where it reached number 54.

An American version of &quot;Jelängerjelieber&quot; titled &quot;Honeysuckle&quot; was released in July 2006 by US record label Minty Fresh. For this album, three songs were re-recorded in English: &quot;Für alle, die&quot;, &quot;Tausendfach&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot;, the respective official English titles being “This Is for Everyone”, “A Thousand Ways” and “Gold”.

Klee&#x27;s third album, &quot;Zwischen Himmel und Erde&quot; (Between heaven and earth), came out in August 2006 and became the band&#x27;s first top 20 album in Germany, peaking at No. 17. One song from the album, &quot;Die Stadt&quot; (The city), was released earlier in July 2006 as a single and reached No. 55 in the German charts. &quot;Zwischen Himmel und Erde&quot; continued the trend started in &quot;Jelängerjelieber&quot; of Klee’s music becoming less reliant on electronic sounds and giving more prominence to guitar sounds.

In July 2008, Klee released the single &quot;Zwei Herzen&quot; (Two hearts), which became the band&#x27;s first German top 30 single, peaking at No. 29. The single came from Klee&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Berge versetzen&quot; (Moving mountains), which was released in August 2008 and went to No. 15 in the German albums chart. The second single from the album, the title song &quot;Berge versetzen&quot;, was released later in 2008 and reached No. 57 in the German singles chart.

In 2010, Deininger parted company with Kerstgens and Servaes, leaving the duo to record Klee’s fifth album, &quot;Aus lauter Liebe&quot; (Out of sheer love). Released in August 2011, the album was the band’s most successful to date, peaking at No. 6 in the German albums chart. One single released from the album, &quot;Willst du bei mir bleiben&quot; (Do you want to stay with me), reached No. 29 in the German singles chart. &quot;Aus lauter Liebe&quot; shows a further development in Klee&#x27;s sound, with several songs having hints of chanson.

Klee&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, was released in August 2015, featuring bossa nova-influenced cover versions of schlager songs, such as &quot;Hello Again&quot; by Howard Carpendale and &quot;Du bist nicht allein&quot; by Roy Black. The idea of doing the album came about by chance during the recording of Klee&#x27;s next studio album, which is due to be released in 2016. &quot;Hello Again&quot; charted at No. 23 in the German albums chart.

== Live performances ==
Klee frequently performs live, giving up to 150 concerts each year. The band’s appearances ranged from performances at small venues to opening for established bands such as The Wedding Present and Nena. Outside Germany, Klee has performed in London and Amsterdam, and also in Turkey, Russia and China following invitations from the Goethe-Institut. For live performances, additional musicians including drummer, bassist and guitarist are added to Klee’s lineup and the band adopts a greater &quot;rock sound&quot; than in its studio recordings.

== Musical style ==
Deininger described Klee&#x27;s musical style in a 2009 interview: &quot;We make international pop music that has its roots in the eighties. It can be more minimalistic and electronic, as on the debut album &quot;Unverwundbar&quot;, or it can be more acoustic and on a grander scale, as on the third album &quot;Zwischen Himmel und Erde&quot;.&quot; (&quot;Wir produzieren internationale Popmusik, die ihre Wurzeln in den Achtzigern hat. Mal minimalistischer und elektronischer, wie auf dem ersten Album ,Unverwundbar´, mal akustischer und größer, wie auf dem dritten Album ,Zwischen Himmel und Erde&#x27;.&quot;)

In its biography of Klee, online music magazine &quot;laut.de&quot; called the band the great romantics of German pop (&quot;&quot;die großen Romantiker des deutschen Pop&quot;) and described the band&#x27;s music as a harmonious marriage of synthesizer sounds, forceful drums and British-style electric guitars (&quot;Synthie-Sounds, druckvolles Schlagzeug und britisch angehauchte E-Gitarren gehen eine harmonische Ehe ein&quot;). The magazine also noted the contribution by Kerstgens&#x27; unique, softly breathing and velvety voice (&quot;veredelt von Suzie Kerstgens einzigartiger, weich hauchender und samtenen Stimme&quot;&quot;).

Various journalists have noticed the British pop influences in Klee&#x27;s music. In its review of the album &quot;Jelängerjelieber&quot;, music website &quot;plattentests.de&quot; found such influences in the songs &quot;Gold&quot; (New Order), &quot;Unser Film&quot; (The Cure) and &quot;Wunschfrei&quot; (Coldplay).

=== Lyrics ===
Klee&#x27;s lyrics are written by Kerstgens, while the other band members provide the music. The band also has a long-time working relationship with German songwriter Tom Liwa. Songs are produced in the band&#x27;s own studio in Cologne.

Klee&#x27;s lyrics refer to deeply felt moments in human relationships. Klee&#x27;s lyrics straddle the material world and a dream world in which desires and conflicts intermingle.

In a 2012 interview, Kerstgens stated: &quot;I completely open up my heart in our songs. Everything in Klee is autobiographical, personally experienced and personally suffered.&quot; (&quot;Ich offenbare in unseren Songs komplett mein Herz. Bei Klee ist alles autobiografisch, selbst erlebt und selbst erlitten.&quot;)

<text>Black Canadians () are Canadians of full or partial Afro-Caribbean or sub-Saharan African descent. 

Black Canadian settlement and immigration patterns can be categorized into two distinct groups. The majority of Black Canadians are descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean and the African continent who arrived in Canada during significant migration waves, beginning in the post-war era of the 1950s and continuing into recent decades.

A smaller yet historically significant population includes the descendants of African Americans, including fugitive slaves, Black loyalists and refugees from the War of 1812. Their descendants primarily settled in Nova Scotia and Southern Ontario, where they formed distinctive identities such as Black Ontarians and African Nova Scotians.

Black Canadians have contributed to many areas of Canadian culture. Many of the first visible minorities to hold high public offices have been Black, including Michaëlle Jean, Donald Oliver, Stanley G. Grizzle, Rosemary Brown, and Lincoln Alexander. Black Canadians form the third-largest visible minority group in Canada, after South Asian and Chinese Canadians.

==Population==
According to the 2021 census by Statistics Canada, 1,547,870 Canadians identified as Black, constituting 4.3% of the entire Canadian population. Of the black population, 10 per cent identified as mixed-race of &quot;white and black&quot;. The five most black-populated provinces in 2021 were Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba. The 10 most black-populated census metropolitan areas were Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Hamilton, Oshawa, and Québec City. Preston, in the Halifax area, is the community with the highest percentage of Black people, with 69.4%; it was a settlement where the Crown provided land to Black Loyalists after the American Revolution. Brooks, a town in southeastern Alberta, is the census subdivision with the highest percentage of Black people, with 22.3%. The community there is mainly composed of East African immigrants.

In the 2011 census, 945,665 Black Canadians were counted, making up 2.9% of Canada&#x27;s population. In the 2016 census, the black population totalled 1,198,540, encompassing 3.5% of the country&#x27;s population.

The 10 largest sources of migration for Black Canadians are Jamaica (136,505), Haiti (110,920), Nigeria (109,240), Ethiopia (43,205), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (37,875), Cameroon (33,200), Somalia (32,285), Eritrea (31,500), Ghana (28,420), and the United States (27,055).

69.1% of Black Canadians are Christian, while 11.9% are Muslim and 18.2% are irreligious. This is compared to 53.3%, 4.9%, and 34.6%, respectively, of Canadians as a whole. Among first-generation Black Canadian immigrants, 74.2% are Christian, 13.3% are Muslim, and 11.4% are irreligious.

A small amount of Black Canadians (0.6%) also have some Indigenous heritage, due to historical intermarriage between Black and First Nations or Métis communities. Historically little known, this aspect of Black Canadian cultural history began to emerge in the 2010s, most notably through the musical and documentary film project &quot;The Afro-Métis Nation&quot;.

=== Demographics and census issues ===
At times, Black Canadians are claimed to have been significantly undercounted in census data. Writer George Elliott Clarke has cited a McGill University study which found that fully 43% of all Black Canadians were not counted as Black in the 1991 Canadian census, because they had identified on census forms as British, French, or other cultural identities, which were not included in the census group of Black cultures.

Although subsequent censuses have reported the population of Black Canadians to be much more consistent with the McGill study&#x27;s revised 1991 estimate than with the official 1991 census data, no study has been conducted to determine whether some Black Canadians are still substantially missed by the self-identification method.

=== Mixed unions ===
In the 2006 census, 25.5% of Black Canadians were in a mixed union with a non-Black person. Black and non-Black couples represented 40.6% of pairings involving a Black person. Among native-born Black Canadians in couples, 63% of them were in a mixed union. About 17% of Black Canadians born in the Caribbean and in Bermuda were in a mixed relationship, compared to 13% of African-born Black Canadians. Furthermore, 30% of Black men in unions were in mixed unions, compared to 20% of Black women.

==Terminology==

There is no single generally-accepted name for Canadians of Black African descent.

The term &quot;African Canadian&quot; is used by some Black Canadians who trace their heritage to enslaved peoples brought by British and French colonists to the North American mainland and to Black Loyalists. This group includes those who were promised freedom by the British during the American Revolutionary War; thousands of Black Loyalists, including Thomas Peters, were resettled by the Crown in Canada after the war. In addition, an estimated 10,000-30,000 fugitive slaves reached freedom in Canada from the Southern United States during the years before the American Civil War, aided by people along the Underground Railroad. Starting in the 1970s, some persons with multi-generational Canadian ancestry began distinguishing themselves by identifying as Indigenous Black Canadians.

Black Nova Scotians, a distinct cultural group, some of whom can trace their Canadian ancestry back to the 1700s, use both &quot;African Canadian&quot; and &quot;Black Canadian&quot; to describe themselves. For example, there is an Office of African Nova Scotian Affairs and a Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia.

Black Canadians often draw a distinction between those of Afro-Caribbean ancestry and those of other African roots. Many Black people of Caribbean origin in Canada reject the term &quot;African Canadian&quot; as an elision of the uniquely Caribbean aspects of their heritage, instead identifying as &quot;Caribbean Canadian&quot;. However, this usage can be problematic because the Caribbean is not populated only by people of African origin, but also by large groups of Indo-Caribbean people, Chinese Caribbean people, European Caribbean people, Syrian or Lebanese Caribbean people, Latinos, and Amerindians. The term West Indian is often used by those of Caribbean ancestry, although the term is more of a cultural description than a racial one, and can equally be applied to groups of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

More specific national terms such as Jamaican Canadian, Haitian Canadian, or Ghanaian Canadian are also used. No widely used alternative to &quot;Black Canadian&quot; is accepted by the Afro-Caribbean population, those of more recent African extraction, descendants of immigrants from the United States, and other Canadians of Black African descent as an umbrella term for the whole group.

One increasingly common practice, seen in academic usage and in the names and mission statements of some Black Canadian cultural and social organizations, is to always make reference to both the African and Caribbean communities. For example, one key health organization dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and prevention in the Black Canadian community is now named the African and Caribbean Council on HIV/AIDS in Ontario, the Toronto publication &quot;Pride&quot; bills itself as an &quot;African-Canadian and Caribbean-Canadian news magazine&quot;, and G98.7, a Black-oriented community radio station in Toronto, was initially branded as the Caribbean African Radio Network.

In French, the terms &quot;Noirs canadiens&quot; or &quot;Afro-Canadiens&quot; are used. &quot;Nègre&quot; (&quot;Negro&quot;) is considered derogatory. Quebec film director Robert Morin faced controversy in 2002 when he chose the title &quot;Le Nèg&#x27;&quot; for a film about anti-Black racism, and in 2015 five placenames containing &quot;Nègre&quot; (as well as six that contained the English term &quot;nigger&quot;) were changed after the Commission de toponymie du Québec ruled the terms no longer acceptable for use in geographic names.

==History==
The Black presence in Canada is rooted mostly in voluntary immigration. Despite the various dynamics that may complicate the personal and cultural interrelationships between descendants of the Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, descendants of former American slaves who viewed Canada as the promise of freedom at the end of the Underground Railroad, and more recent immigrants from the Caribbean or Africa, one common element that unites all of these groups is that they are in Canada because they or their ancestors actively chose of their own free will to settle there.

===First Black people in Canada===


The first recorded Black person to have potentially entered Canadian waters was an unnamed Black man on board the &quot;Jonas&quot;, which was bound for Port-Royal (Acadia). He died of scurvy either at Port Royal, or along the journey, in 1606. The first recorded Black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named Mathieu da Costa. Travelling with navigator Samuel de Champlain, da Costa arrived in Nova Scotia some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts. The first known Black person to live in what would become Canada was an enslaved man from Madagascar named Olivier Le Jeune, who may have been of partial Malay ancestry. He was first given to one of the Kirke brothers, likely David Kirke, before being sold as a young child to a French clerk and then later given to Guillaume Couillard, a friend of Champlain&#x27;s. Le Jeune apparently was set free before his death in 1654, because his death certificate lists him as a &quot;domestique&quot; rather than a slave.

As a group, Black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the French Army and Navy, though some were enslaved or indentured servants. About 1,000 enslaved people were brought to New France in the 17th and 18th centuries. By the time of the British conquest of New France in 1759–1760, about 3,604 enslaved people were in New France, of whom 1,132 were Black and the rest First Nations people. The majority of the slaves lived in Montreal, the largest city in New France and the centre of the lucrative fur trade.

The majority of the enslaved Africans in New France performed domestic work and were brought to New France to demonstrate the prestige of their wealthy owners, who viewed owning a &quot;slave&quot; as a way of showing off their status and wealth. The majority of the enslaved Africans brought to New France were female domestic servants, and were usually raped by their masters (enslavers), who tended to literally see their enslaved women and girls as their sex slaves. As a result of usually working in the home rather than the fields or mines, enslaved Africans typically lived longer than Aboriginal enslaved people: an average 25.2 years instead of 17.7. As in France&#x27;s colonies in the West Indies, slavery in New France was governed by the Code Noir (&quot;Black Code&quot;) issued by King Louis XIV in 1685 which stated that only Catholics could own slaves; required that all slaves be converted to Roman Catholicism upon their purchase; recognized slave marriages as legal; and forbade masters from selling slave children under the age of 14. Black slaves could also serve as witnesses at religious ceremonies, file legal complaints against free persons and be tried by a jury.

Marie-Joseph Angélique, a black enslaved African from the Madeira islands who arrived in New France in 1725, was accused of setting the fire that burned down most of Montreal on 10 April 1734, for which she was executed. Angélique confessed under torture to setting the fire as a way of creating a diversion so she could escape as she did not wish to be separated from her lover, a white servant named Claude Thibault, as her master (enslaver) was going to sell her to the owner of a sugar plantation in the West Indies. Whether this confession was genuine or not continues to divide historians.

Marie Marguerite Rose, a woman from what is now modern Guinea was sold into slavery in 1736 when she was about 19 and arrived in Louisbourg on Île Royale (modern Cape Breton Island) the same year as the property of Jean Chrysostome Loppinot, a French naval officer stationed at Louisbourg, who fathered a son by her in 1738. In 1755, she was freed and married a Miꞌkmaq Indian who upon his conversion to Roman Catholicism had taken the name Jean-Baptist Laurent. Rose, an excellent cook, became the most successful businesswomen on Île Royale, opening up a tavern that was famous for the quality of its food and brandy all over the island. When she died in 1757, her will and inventory of her possessions showed that she owned expensive clothing imported from France, and like many other women from 18th century west Africa had a fondness for brightly coloured dresses.

When New France was ceded to England in 1763, French colonists were assured that they could retain their human property. In 1790, when the British wanted to encourage immigration, they included in law the right to free importation of &quot;Negroes, household furniture, utensils of husbandary or clothing.&quot; Although enslaved African people were no longer legally allowed to be bought or sold in Canada, the practice remained legal, although it was increasingly unpopular and written against in local newspapers. By 1829, when the American Secretary of State requested Paul Vallard be extradited to the United States for helping a slave to escape to Canada, the Executive Council of Lower Canada replied, &quot;The state of slavery is not recognized by the Law of Canada. [...] Every Slave therefore who comes into the Province is immediately free whether he has been brought in by violence or has entered it of his own accord.&quot; The British formally outlawed slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833.

The descendants of Black slaves from New France and Lower Canada are white-passing French Canadians. Their family names are Carbonneau, Charest, Johnson, Lafleur, Lemire, Lepage, Marois, Paradis, etc.

===African Americans during the American Revolution===
At the time of the American Revolution, inhabitants of the British colonies in North America had to decide where their future lay. Those from the Thirteen Colonies loyal to the British Crown were called United Empire Loyalists and came north. Many White American Loyalists brought their enslaved African people with them, numbering between 1,500 and 2,500 individuals. During the war, the British had promised freedom and land to enslaved African people who left rebel masters and worked for them; this was announced in Virginia through Lord Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation. Enslaved African people also escaped to British lines in New York City and Charleston, and their forces evacuated thousands after the war. They transported 3,000 people to Nova Scotia.

This latter group was largely made up of merchants and labourers, and many set up home in Birchtown near Shelburne. Some settled in New Brunswick. Both groups suffered from discriminatory treatment by white settlers and prominent landowners who still held enslaved African people. Some of the refugees had been free black people prior to the war and fled with the other refugees to Nova Scotia, relying on British promises of equality. Under pressure of the new refugees, the city of Saint John amended its charter in 1785 specifically to exclude people of African descent from practicing a trade, selling goods, fishing in the harbour, or becoming freemen; these provisions stood until 1870, although by then they were largely ignored.

In 1782, the first race riot in North America took place in Shelburne; white veterans attacked African American settlers who were getting work that the former soldiers thought they should have. Due to the failure of the British government to support the settlement, the harsh weather, and discrimination on the part of white colonists, 1,192 Black Loyalist men, women and children left Nova Scotia for West Africa on 15 January 1792. They settled in what is now Sierra Leone, where they became the original settlers of Freetown. They, along with other groups of free transplanted people such as the Black Poor from England, became what is now the Sierra Leone Creole people, also known as the &quot;Krio&quot;.

Although difficult to estimate due to the failure to differentiate enslaved African people and free Black populations, it is estimated that by 1784 there were around 40 enslaved Africans within Montreal, compared to around 304 enslaved Africans within the Province of Quebec. By 1799, vital records note 75 entries regarding Black Canadians, a number that doubled by 1809.

===Maroons from the Caribbean===
On 26 June 1796, Jamaican Maroons, numbering 543 men, women and children, were deported on board the three ships &quot;Dover&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Anne&quot; from Jamaica, after being defeated in an uprising against the British colonial government. Their initial destination was Lower Canada, but on 21 and 23 July, the ships arrived in Nova Scotia. At this time Halifax was undergoing a major construction boom initiated by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn&#x27;s efforts to modernize the city&#x27;s defences. The many building projects had created a labour shortage. Edward was impressed by the Maroons and immediately put them to work at the Citadel in Halifax, Government House, and other defence works throughout the city.

Funds had been provided by the Government of Jamaica to aid in the resettlement of the Maroons in Canada. Five thousand acres were purchased at Preston, Nova Scotia, at a cost of £3000. Small farm lots were provided to the Maroons and they attempted to farm the infertile land. Like the former tenants, they found the land at Preston to be unproductive; as a result they had little success. The Maroons also found farming in Nova Scotia difficult because the climate would not allow cultivation of familiar food crops, such as bananas, yams, pineapples, or cocoa. Small numbers of Maroons relocated from Preston to Boydville for better farming land. The British Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth made an effort to change the Maroons&#x27; culture and beliefs by introducing them to Christianity. From the monies provided by the Jamaican Government, Wentworth procured an annual stipend of £240 for the support of a school and religious education.

After suffering through the harsh winter of 1796–1797, Wentworth reported the Maroons expressed a desire that &quot;they wish to be sent to India or somewhere in the east, to be landed with arms in some country with a climate like that they left, where they may take possession with a strong hand&quot;. The British Government and Wentworth opened discussions with the Sierra Leone Company in 1799 to send the Maroons to Sierra Leone. In 1796, the Jamaican government initially planned to send the Maroons to Sierra Leone but the Sierra Leone Company rejected the idea. The initial reaction in 1799 was the same, but the company was eventually persuaded to accept the Maroon settlers. On 6 August 1800, the Maroons departed Halifax, arriving on 1 October at Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Upon their arrival in West Africa in 1800, they were used to quell an uprising among the black settlers from Nova Scotia and London. After eight years, they were unhappy with their treatment by the Sierra Reynolds Company.

===Abolition of slavery===
The Canadian climate made it uneconomic to keep enslaved African people year-round, unlike the plantation agriculture practiced in the southern United States and Caribbean. Slavery within the colonial economy became increasingly rare. For example, the powerful Mohawk leader Joseph Brant purchased and enslaved an African American named Sophia Burthen Pooley, whom he kept for about 12 years before selling her for $100.

In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles followed by the &quot;Knight v. Wedderburn&quot; decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia. In 1788, abolitionist James Drummond MacGregor from Pictou published the first anti-slavery literature in Canada and began purchasing slaves&#x27; freedom and chastising his colleagues in the Presbyterian church who owned slaves.

In 1790 John Burbidge, a member of Nova Scotia&#x27;s House of Assembly, freed the African people he had enslaved, giving them two sets of clothes and arranging for their learning to read. Led by Richard John Uniacke, in 1787, 1789 and again on 11 January 1808, the Nova Scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery. Two chief justices, Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange (1790–1796) and Sampson Salter Blowers (1797–1832) were instrumental in freeing enslaved Africans from their enslavers (owners) in Nova Scotia. These justices were held in high regard in the colony.

In 1793, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, attempted to abolish slavery. That same year, the new Legislative Assembly became the first entity in the British Empire to restrict slavery, confirming existing ownership but allowing for anyone born to an enslaved woman or girl after that date to be freed at the age of 25. Slavery was all but abolished throughout the other British North American colonies by 1800. The Slave Trade Act 1807 outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 outlawed slave-holding altogether in the colonies (except for India). This made Canada an attractive destination for many African descendant refugees fleeing slavery in the United States, such as minister Boston King.

===War of 1812===
The next major migration of Black people occurred between 1813 and 1815. Refugees from the War of 1812, primarily from the Chesapeake Bay and Georgia Sea Islands, fled the United States to settle in Hammonds Plains, Beechville, Lucasville, North Preston, East Preston, Africville and Elm Hill, New Brunswick. An April 1814 proclamation of Black freedom and settlement by British Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane led to an exodus of around 3,500 Black Americans by 1818. The settlement of the refugees was initially seen as a means of creating prosperous agricultural communities; however, poor economic conditions following the war coupled with the granting of infertile farmland to refugees caused economic hardship. Social integration proved difficult in the early years, as the prevalence of enslaved Africans in the Maritimes caused the newly freed Black Canadians to be viewed on the same level of the enslaved. Politically, the black Loyalist communities in both Nova Scotia and Upper Canada were characterized by what the historian James Walker called &quot;a tradition of intense loyalty to Britain&quot; for granting them freedom and Canadian Black people tended to be active in the militia, especially in Upper Canada during the War of 1812 as the possibility of an American victory would also mean the possibility of their re-enslavement. Militarily, a Black Loyalist named Richard Pierpoint, who was born about 1744 in Senegal and who had settled near present-day St. Catharines, Ontario, offered to organize a Corps of Men of Colour to support the British war effort. This was refused but a white officer raised a small black corps. This &quot;Coloured Corps&quot; fought at Queenston Heights and the siege of Fort George, defending what would become Canada from the invading American army. Many of the refugees from America would later serve with distinction during the war in matters both strictly military, along with the use of freed African people in assisting in the further liberation of African Americans enslaved people.

===Underground Railroad===
There is a sizeable community of Black Canadians in Nova Scotia and Southern Ontario who trace their ancestry to African-American slaves who used the Underground Railroad to flee from the United States, seeking refuge and freedom in Canada. From the late 1820s, through the time that the United Kingdom itself forbade slavery in 1833, until the American Civil War began in 1861, the Underground Railroad brought tens of thousands of fugitive slaves to Canada. In 1819, Sir John Robinson, the Attorney-General of Upper Canada, ruled: &quot;Since freedom of the person is the most important civil right protected by the law of England...the negroes are entitled to personal freedom through residence in Upper Canada and any attempt to infringe their rights will be resisted in the courts&quot;. After Robinson&#x27;s ruling in 1819, judges in Upper Canada refused American requests to extradite run-away slaves who reached Upper Canada under the grounds &quot;every man is free who reaches British ground&quot;. One song popular with African Americans called the &quot;Song of the Free&quot; had the lyrics: &quot;I&#x27;m on my way to Canada, That cold and distant land, The dire effects of slavery, I can no longer stand, Farewell, old master, Don&#x27;t come after me, I&#x27;m on my way to Canada, Where colored men are free!&quot;.

In 1850, the United States Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which gave bounty hunters the right to recapture run-away slaves anywhere in the United States and ordered all federal, state and municipal law enforcement to co-operate with the bounty hunters in seizing run-away slaves. Since the Fugitive Slave Act stripped accused fugitive slaves of any legal rights such as the right to testify in court that they were not run-away slaves, cases of freemen and freewomen being kidnapped off the streets to be sold into slavery became common. The U.S. justice system in the 1850s was hostile to black people, and little inclined to champion their rights. In 1857, in the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that black Americans were not and never could be U.S. citizens under any conditions, a ruling that appeared to suggest that laws prohibiting slavery in the northern states were unconstitutional.

As a result of the Fugitive Slave Act and legal rulings to expand slavery in the United States, many free blacks living in the United States chose to seek sanctuary in Canada with one newspaper in 1850 mentioning that a group of blacks working for a Pittsburgh hotel had armed themselves with handguns before heading for Canada saying they were &quot;...determined to die rather be captured&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Colonist&quot; newspaper on 17 June 1852 noted that almost every ship or boat coming into Toronto harbour from the American side of Lake Ontario seemed to be carrying a run-away slave. One of the more active &quot;conductors&quot; on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Tubman, the &quot;Black Moses&quot; who made 11 trips to bring about 300 run-away slaves to Canada, most of whom settled in St. Catherines. Tubman guided her &quot;passengers&quot; on nocturnal journeys (travelling via day was too risky) through the forests and swamps, using as her compass the north-star and on cloudy nights seeing what side the moss was growing on trees, to find the best way to Canada.Such trips on the Underground Railroad involved much privation and suffering as Tubman and her &quot;passengers&quot; had to avoid both the bounty-hunters and law enforcement and could go for days without food as they travelled through the wilderness, always following the north-star. Tubman usually went to Rochester, New York, where Frederick Douglass would shelter the run-aways, and crossed over to Canada at Niagara Falls. Unlike the U.S. customs, which under the Fugitive Slave Act had to co-operate with the bounty hunters, the customs authorities on the Canadian side of the border were far more helpful and &quot;looked the other way&quot; when Tubman entered Canada with her &quot;passengers&quot;.
During the course of one week in June 1854, 23 run-away slaves evaded the U.S. border patrols to cross the Detroit river to freedom in Windsor while 43 free people also crossed over to Windsor out of the fear of the bounty hunters. The American-born Canadian sociologist Daniel G. Hill wrote this week in June 1854 appeared to be typical of the black exodus to Canada. Public opinion tended to be on the side of run-away slaves and against the slavers. On 26 February 1851, the Toronto chapter of the Anti-Slavery Society was founded with what was described by the &quot;Globe&quot; newspaper as &quot;the largest and most enthusiastic meeting we have ever seen in Toronto&quot; that issued the resolution: &quot;slavery is an outrage on the laws of humanity and its continued practice demands the best exertions for its extinction&quot;. The same meeting committed its members to help the many &quot;houseless and homeless victims of slavery flying to our soil&quot;. The Congregationalist minister, the Reverend Samuel Ringgold Ward of New York, who had been born into slavery in Maryland, wrote about Canada West (modern Ontario) that: &quot;Toronto is somewhat peculiar in many ways, anti-slavery is more popular there than in any city I know save Syracuse...I had good audiences in the towns of Vaughan, Markham, Pickering and in the village of Newmarket. Anti-slavery feeling is spreading and increasing in all these places. The public mind literally thirsts for the truth, and honest listeners and anxious inquirers will travel many miles, crowd our country chapels, and remain for hours eagerly and patiently seeking the light&quot;. Ward himself had been forced to flee to Canada West in 1851 for his role in the Jerry Rescue, leading to his indictment for violating the Fugitive Slave Act. Despite the support to run-away slaves, blacks in Canada West, which become Ontario in 1867, were confined to segregated schools.

American bounty-hunters who crossed into Canada to kidnap black people to sell into slavery were prosecuted for kidnapping if apprehended by the authorities. In 1857, an attempt by two American bounty hunters, T.G. James and John Wells, to kidnap Joseph Alexander, a 20-year-old run-away slave from New Orleans living in Chatham, was foiled when a large crowd of black people surrounded the bounty hunters as they were leaving the Royal Exchange Hotel in Chatham with Alexander who had gone there to confront them. Found on one of the bounty hunters was a letter from Alexander&#x27;s former master describing him as a slave of &quot;saucy&quot; disposition who had smashed the master&#x27;s carriage and freed a span of his horses before running away, adding that he was keen to get Alexander back so he could castrate him. Castration was the normal punishment for a male run-away slave. Alexander gave a speech to the assembled by-standers watching the confrontation denouncing life in the &quot;slave pens&quot; of New Orleans as extremely dehumanizing and stated he would rather die than return to living as a slave. Alexander described life in the &quot;slave pens&quot; as a regime of daily whippings, beatings and rapes designed to cow the slaves into a state of utter submission. The confrontation ended with Alexander being freed and the crowd marching Wells and James to the railroad station, warning them to never return to Chatham.

The refugee slaves who settled in Canada did so primarily in South Western Ontario, with significant concentrations being found in Amherstburg, Colchester, Chatham, Windsor, and Sandwich. Run-away slaves tended to concentrate, partly to provide mutual support, partly because of prejudices, and partly out of the fear of American bounty hunters crossing the border. The run-away slaves usually arrived destitute and without any assets, had to work as labourers for others until they could save up enough money to buy their own farms. These settlements acted as centres of abolitionist thought, with Chatham being the location of abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s constitutional convention which preceded the later raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry. The first newspaper published by a black woman was founded in North Buxton by the free Black Mary Ann Shadd which pressed for Black emigration to Canada as the best option for fleeing African Americans. The settlement of Elgin was formed in 1849 with the royal assent of Governor-General of the time James Bruce as a settlement for Black Canadians and escaped slaves based upon social welfare and the prevention of moral decay among the Black community there. Led by the Elgin Association and preacher William King, the settlement flourished as a model of a successful predominantly African settlement which held close to 200 families by 1859.

Following the abolition of slavery in the British empire in 1834, any black man born a British subject or who became a British subject was allowed to vote and run for office, provided that they owned taxable property. The property requirement on voting in Canada was not ended until 1920. Black Canadian women like all other Canadian women were not granted the right to vote until partially in 1917 ( when wives, daughters, sisters and mothers of servicemen were granted the right to vote) and fully in 1918 (when all women were granted the right to vote). In 1850, Canadian black women together with all other women were granted the right to vote for school trustees, which was the limit of female voting rights in Canada West. In 1848, in Colchester county in Canada West, white men prevented black men from voting in the municipal elections, but following complaints in the courts, a judge ruled that black voters could not be prevented from voting. Ward, writing about the Colchester case in the &quot;Voice of the Fugitive&quot; newspaper, declared that the right to vote was the &quot;most sacred&quot; of all rights, and that even if white men took away everything from the black farmers in Colchester county, that would still be a lesser crime compared with losing the &quot;right of a British vote&quot;. In 1840, Wilson Ruffin Abbott became the first black elected to any office in what became Canada when he was elected to the city council in Toronto. Unlike in the United States, in Canada after the abolition of slavery in 1834, black Canadians were never stripped of their right to vote and hold office.

Though often ignored, from time to time, black Canadians did receive notice. In 1857, William Hall of Horton, Nova Scotia, serving as a sailor in the Royal Navy, became the first black man to win the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for valor in the British empire, for his actions at the siege of Lucknow. Following the end of the American Civil War and subsequent emancipation of enslaved African Americans, a significant population remained, concentrated both within settlements established in the decades preceding the Civil War, and existing urban environments like Toronto.

The Anti-Slavery Society of Canada estimated in its first report in 1852 that the &quot;coloured population of Upper Canada&quot; was about 30,000, of whom almost all adults were &quot;fugitive slaves&quot; from the United States. St. Catharines, Ontario had a population of 6,000 at that time; 800 of its residents were &quot;of African descent&quot;. Many slaves sought refuge in Toronto which was known as a tolerant city. Black Canadians integrated in many areas of society, but the influence of slavery in the south still impacted these citizens. For example, in the 1860s, a false story was spread in multiple newspapers across the United States and Canada about the suffering and death of Mary Mink, daughter of James Mink, a wealthy and well-respected African-Canadian business man in Toronto. The story, reproduced many times with slightly different details, claimed that James Mink offered a hefty sum for any white man who would marry his daughter, after which she was wed to a white man named James Andrews, who sold her into slavery under the pre tense of a honeymoon in the Southern States. In reality, all records show that Mary Mink married a black man named William Johnson, had two children with him, and died peacefully in her home 25 years later, surrounded by friends and family. The origin of this myth was likely an 1853 article in the Hamilton Spectator, which conveyed (without names) the story of a black man who sold his black wife into slavery. The purpose of the article was to justify the actions of a prominent white Canadian, Harvey Smith, who was accused of selling two black Canadian youths into slavery. The Spectator article read, &quot;when such acts are perpetrated by colored people themselves, we cease to wonder at Mr Harvey Smith attempting to make money by an operation in which the negro is as expert as the white man&quot;. This article claimed to have received the story from papers in Toronto, but no mention of it can be found in any surviving Toronto papers of the time. The article was then used as inspiration for a section in Scottish poet William Edmondstoune Aytoun&#x27;s novel Norman Sinclair, which told the same story but made it about the mixed-race daughter of &quot;a thriving horse-dealer, who had been located at Toronto some 30 years&quot;, a description which could only match Mink at the time. Aytoun used the trope of the tragic mulatto and others in his book to degrade the Mink family and successful free black Canadians in general. The myth of Mary Mink remains to this day, and was even made into 1996 TV movie called &quot;Captive Heart: The James Mink Story&quot;, which bills itself as &quot;based on a true story&quot;.

===West Coast===
In 1858, James Douglas, the governor of the British colony of Vancouver Island, replied to an inquiry from a group of black people in San Francisco about the possibilities of settling in his jurisdiction. They were angered that the California legislature had passed discriminatory laws to restrict black people in the state, preventing them from owning property and requiring them to wear badges. Governor Douglas, whose mother was a &quot;free coloured&quot; person of mixed black and white ancestry from the Caribbean, replied favourably. Later that year, an estimated 600 to 800 black Americans migrated to Victoria, settling on Vancouver Island and Salt Spring Island. At least two became successful merchants there: Peter Lester and Mifflin Wistar Gibbs. The latter also entered politics, being elected to the newly established City Council in the 1860s.

Gibbs returned to the United States with his family in the late 1860s after slavery had been abolished following the war; he settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, the capital of the state. He became an attorney and was elected as the first black judge in the US. He became a wealthy businessman who was involved with the Republican Party; in 1897 he was appointed by the President of the US as consul to Madagascar.

===The late Victorian era===
Unlike in the United States, there were no &quot;Jim Crow&quot; laws in Canada at the federal level of government and outside of education, none at the provincial level of government.Instead segregation depended upon the prejudices of local school board trustees, businessmen, realtors, union leaders and landlords. The Common School Act of 1850 imposed segregation in Canada West while the Education Act of 1865 likewise imposed segregation in Nova Scotia, through in both cases school boards were given considerable leeway to decide to segregate or not. The school board for Halifax imposed racial segregation in 1865, but in 1883 the middle class black Haligonian community successfully petitioned the school board to allow their children to attend schools with white children following the closure of a school for black children in the north end of Halifax. However, the emergence of a black community in the Africville district in Halifax around 1848, made up of the descendants of American slaves who had escaped to Royal Navy warships operating in Chesapeake Bay in 1814, did lead to de facto segregation for most black Haligonian children. 

Africville was described as a &quot;close knit and self-sustaining community&quot; which by the 1860s had its own school, general store, post office and the African United Baptist Church, which was attended by most residents. The black Canadian communities in the late 19th century had a very strong sense of community identity, and black community leaders in both Nova Scotia and Ontario often volunteered to serve as teachers. Through the budgets for black schools in Nova Scotia and Ontario were inferior to those for white schools, the efforts of black community leaders serving as teachers did provide for a &quot;supportive and caring environment&quot; that ensured that black children received at least some education. In a sign in pride in their African heritage, the principal meeting hall for black Haligonians was named Menelik Hall after the Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia who defeated the Italians in the First Italo-Ethiopian War (1895–1896), the only time an African nation had defeated a European nation during the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;.

===Immigration restrictions===
In the early twentieth century, the Canadian government had an unofficial policy of restricting immigration by Black people. The huge influx of immigrants from Europe and the United States in the period before World War I included few black people, as most immigrants were coming from Eastern and Southern Europe.

Clifford Sifton&#x27;s 1910 immigration campaign had not anticipated that Black Oklahomans and other black farmers from the Southern United States would apply to homestead in Amber Valley, Alberta and other parts of Canada.

However, Canada acted to restrict immigration by Black persons, a policy that was formalized in 1911 by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier:

His excellency in Council, in virtue of the provisions of Sub-section (c) of Section 38 of the Immigration Act, is pleased to Order and it is hereby Ordered as follows: For a period of one year from and after the date hereof the landing in Canada shall be and the same is prohibited of any immigrants belonging to the Negro race, which race is deemed unsuitable to the climate and requirements of Canada.

===1900s and 1910s===
The flow between the United States and Canada continued in the twentieth century. Some Black Canadians trace their ancestry to people who fled racism in Oklahoma, Texas, and other southern states in the early 1900s as part of the Great Migration out of the rural South, building new homesteads and communities – often block settlements – in Alberta and Saskatchewan just after they became provinces in 1905. Examples include Amber Valley, Campsie, Junkins (now Wildwood) and Keystone (now Breton) in Alberta, as well as a former community in the Rural Municipality of Eldon, north of Maidstone, Saskatchewan (see, for example, Saskatchewan Municipal Heritage Property No. 439: the original log-style Shiloh (Charlow) Baptist Church and associated cemetery, 30 km north of Maidstone.) Many of them were disappointed to encounter racism when they arrived in Canada, which they had regarded as a kind of Promised Land.

Historically, Black Canadians, being descended from either Black Loyalists or American run-away slaves, had supported the Conservative Party as the party most inclined to maintain ties with Britain, which was seen as the nation that had given them freedom. The Liberals were historically the party of continentalism (i.e. moving Canada closer to the United States), which was not an appealing position for most Black Canadians. In the first half of the 20th century, Black Canadians usually voted solidly for the Conservatives as the party seen as the most pro-British. Until the 1930s–1940s, the majority of Black Canadians lived in rural areas, mostly in Ontario and Nova Scotia, which provided a certain degree of insulation from the effects of racism. The self-contained nature of the rural Black communities in Ontario and Nova Scotia with Black farmers clustered together in certain rural counties meant that racism was not experienced on a daily basis. The centre of social life in the rural black communities were the churches, usually Methodist or Baptist, and ministers were generally the most important community leaders. Through anti-Black racism did exist in Canada, as the Black population in Canada was extremely small, there was nothing comparable to the massive campaign directed against Asian immigration, the so-called &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, which was a major political issue in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in British Columbia. In 1908, the Canadian Brotherhood of Railroad Employees and Other Transport Workers (CBRE) was founded under the leadership of Aaron Mosher, an avowed white supremacist who objected to white workers like himself having to work alongside black workers. In 1909 and 1913, Mosher negotiated contracts with the Inter Colonial Railroad Company, where he worked as a freight handler, that imposed segregation in workplaces while giving increased wages and benefits to white workers alone. The contracts that Mosher negotiated in 1909 and 1913 served as the basis for the contracts that other railroad companies negotiated with the CBRE.

In 1913, on the precipice of this racist action against black porters, Nathan Redmon, a black sleeping car porter, came to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After several years of saving his money, Redmon started his own business – the first African-Canadian owned carriage business. By 1937, Redmon&#x27;s business grew to be the second-largest trucking and carriage business in York Township. His successful business which was located just north of Eglinton Avenue at 122 Belgravia Avenue is still remembered to this day in many Toronto publications.

To fight against the discriminatory treatment, the all-black Order of Sleeping Car Porters union was founded in 1917 to fight to end segregation on the railroad lines and to fight for equal pay and benefits.

During the First World War, Black volunteers to the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) were at first refused, but in response to criticism, the Defence Minister, Sir Sam Hughes declared in October 1914 that recruiting colonels were free to accept or reject Black volunteers as they saw fit. Some recruiting colonels rejected all black volunteers while others accepted them; the ability of black men to serve in the CEF was entirely dependent upon how prejudiced and/or desperate for volunteers the local recruiting colonel was. Officially from 1916 onward black Canadians were only assigned to construction units to dig trenches on the Western Front. The Reverend William White, the chaplain of the all-Black Number 2 Construction Company of the CEF, founded on 5 July 1916, was named an honorary captain and thereby became one of the few Black men to receive an officer&#x27;s commission in the CEF. However, the Canadian historian René Chartrand noted that in the 1918 painting &quot;The Conquerors&quot; by Eric Kennington showing the men of the 16th Canadian Scottish battalion (which was recruited in the Toronto area) marching through a ruined landscape in France, one of the soldiers wearing kilts is a Black man, which he used to argue that sometimes Black volunteers were assigned as front-line infantrymen. Despite the rules restricting Black Canadians to construction companies, about 2,000 Black Canadians fought as infantrymen in the CEF and several such as James Grant, Jeremiah Jones, Seymour Tyler, Roy Fells, and Curly Christian being noted for heroism under fire. Jeremiah &quot;Jerry&quot; Jones of Truro, Nova Scotia, enlisted in the 106th Battalion of the CEF in 1916 by lying about his age. Jones was recommended for the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his heroism at Vimy Ridge, where he captured a German machine gun post and was wounded in action, but he never received it. Later in 1917, Jones was badly wounded in the Battle of Passchendaele and was invalided out of the CEF in early 1918. In 2010, Jones was posthumously awarded the Canadian Forces Distinguished Service Medal for his actions at Vimy Ridge. James Grant, a black man from St. Catherine&#x27;s, won the Military Cross in 1918 for taking a German artillery gun while under heavy fire.

===1920s and 1930s===
A wave of immigration occurred in the 1920s, with Black people from the Caribbean coming to work in the steel mills of Cape Breton, replacing those who had come from Alabama in 1899. Many of Canada&#x27;s railway porters were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from the South, New York City, and Washington, D.C. They settled mainly in the major cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, which had major rail connections. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel. A noted cause célèbre in the 1920s was the case of Matthew Bullock. He fled to Canada to avoid a potential lynching in North Carolina and fought extradition to the US.

In September 1915, the U.S. film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; was released in Canada, where it was very popular, and helped to inflame race relations. The first Hollywood &quot;blockbuster&quot;, &quot;The Birth of Nation&quot;, promoted the stereotype of black men as &quot;black beasts&quot; with superhuman strength and an innate desire to rape white women while portraying the Ku Klux Klan as the heroic &quot;white knights of the South&quot;. The film led to a revival of the Klan in the United States, and in the 1920s, the Klan expanded into Canada, having 5,000 members in the Toronto area alone by 1925. Starting in April 1920 with a series of articles by the left-wing British journalist E. D. Morel detailing alleged sexual crimes committed by the Senegalese serving in the French Army in the Rhineland, various left-wing groups in Britain, the United States and Canada started publicizing the so-called &quot;Black Horror on the Rhine&quot;. Morel&#x27;s campaign was carried into Canada with the feminist Rose Henderson for instance warning in a 1925 article in &quot;The BC Federalist&quot; about the possibility of Blacks being raised &quot;to subdue and enslave the white peoples&quot;. The willingness of various left-wing groups in Canada to promote the &quot;Black Horror on the Rhine&quot; campaign as part of the critique of the Treaty of Versailles as too harsh on Germany – which appealed to the worse racial fears by promoting the image of the Senegalese as brutes with superhuman strength and an insatiable need to rape white women – estranged Black Canadians from the left in Canada during the interwar period. Another source of estrangement was the work of one of Canada&#x27;s leading progressives, the feminist Emily Murphy. In a series of articles for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in the early 1920s, which were later turned into the 1922 book &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, Murphy blamed all of the problems on drug addiction among white Canadians on &quot;Negro drug dealers&quot; and Chinese opium dealers &quot;of fishy blood&quot;, accusing Black Canadians and Chinese Canadians of trying to destroy white supremacy by getting white Canadians addicted to drugs. &quot;The Black Candle&quot; was written in a sensationalist and lurid style meant to appeal to the racial fears of white Canadians, and in this Murphy was completely successful. Due to the popularity of &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, Chinese immigration to Canada was stopped via the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923. Marijuana was also banned in 1923 out of the fear prompted by Murphy that marijuana was a drug used by Black Canadians to &quot;corrupt&quot; white Canadians. A report by the Senate in 2002 noted: &quot;Early drug legislation was largely based on a moral panic, racist sentiment and a notorious absence of debate.&quot; Perhaps even more importantly, Murphy established a perceived connection between Black Canadians, drugs, and crime in the minds of white Canadians that continues to this day.

Montreal was the largest and wealthiest city in Canada in the 1920s and also the most cosmopolitan, having a French-Canadian majority with substantial English, Scots, Irish, Italian, and Jewish communities. The multi-cultural atmosphere in Montreal allowed a black community to be established in the 1920s. The Black community that emerged in Montreal in the 1920s was largely American in origin, centring on the &quot;sporting district&quot; between St. Antoine and Bonaventure streets, which had a reputation as a &quot;cool&quot; neighbourhood, known for its lively and often riotous nightclubs that opened at 11:00 pm and closed at 5:00 am, where the latest in Afro-American jazz was played, alcohol was consumed in conspicuous quantities, and illegal gambling was usually tolerated. The Nemderloc Club (nemderloc being &quot;colred men&quot; spelled backwards), which opened in 1922, was the most famous black club in Montreal, being very popular with both locals and Americans seeking to escape Prohibition by coming to Canada, where alcohol was still legal, hence the saying that American tourists wanted to &quot;drink Canada dry&quot;. Many of the Afro-Americans who settled in the &quot;sporting district&quot; of Montreal came from Harlem to seek a place where it was legal to drink alcohol. Relations between the police and the black community in Montreal were unfriendly with the St. Antoine district being regularly raided by the police looking for illegal drugs and gambling establishments.Despite its reputation as the &quot;coolest&quot; neighbourhood in Montreal, the &quot;sporting district&quot;, now known as the Little Burgundy neighbourhood was a centre of poverty with the water being unsafe to drink and a death rate that was twice the norm in Montreal.

As the Afro-Americans who came to work as railroad porters in Canada were all men, about 40 per cent of the Black men living in Montreal in the 1920s were married to white women. This statistic excluded those in common-law relationships, which were also common, and which estranged the Black community of Montreal from the conservative and deeply Christian rural Black communities in Ontario and Nova Scotia, who were offended by the prevalence of casual sex and common-law relationships in the Black community in Montreal. The Afro-American community in Montreal was seen, perhaps not entirely fairly, as a centre of debauchery and licentiousness by the other Black communities in Canada, who made a point of insisting that Montreal was not all representative of their communities. The West Indian communities in the Maritime provinces, with the largest number working in the Cape Breton steel mills and in the Halifax shipyards always referred pejoratively to the older Black community in Nova Scotia as the &quot;Canadians&quot; and the Black communities in Quebec and Ontario as the &quot;Americans&quot;. The West Indian communities in Nova Scotia in the 1920s were Anglican, fond of playing cricket, and unlike the other Black communities in Canada were often involved in Back-to-Africa movements.

The historian Robin Winks described the various Black Canadian communities in the 1920s as being very diverse, which he described as being made up of &quot;rural blacks from small towns in Nova Scotia, prosperous farmers from Ontario, long-time residents of Vancouver Island, sophisticated New York newcomers to Montreal, activist West Indians who were not, they insisted, Negroes at all&quot; – indeed so diverse that unity was difficult. At the same time, Winks wrote that racism in Canada lacked a &quot;consistent pattern&quot; as &quot;racial borders shifted, gave way, and stood firm without consistency, predictability or even credibility&quot;. Inspired by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the United States, in 1924 J. W. Montgomery of Toronto and James Jenkins of London founded the Canadian League for the Advancement of Coloured People as an umbrella group for all of the Canadian Black communities. Another attempt to provide unity for the Black communities in Canada was made by the followers of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s United Negro Improvement Association, which opened its first Canadian branch in Montreal in 1919. After his deportation from the United States in 1927, Garvey settled in Montreal in 1928. However, when Garvey urged his American followers not to vote for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election, the American consul in Montreal complained about this &quot;interference&quot; in American politics and Garvey was expelled from Canada at the urging of the U.S. government. Garvey was allowed to return to Canada in 1936 and 1937 where he held rallies in Toronto preaching his Back-to-Africa message. Garvey, an extremely charismatic man who inspired intense devotion in his followers, proved to be a divisive and controversial figure with his Back-to-Africa message and his insistence that black people embrace segregation as the best way forward. Most Black Canadian community leaders rejected Garvey&#x27;s message, arguing that Canada, not Africa, was their home and that embracing segregation was a retrogressive and self-defeating move.

The Great Depression hit rural Canada very hard and Black Canadian farmers especially hard. One consequence was that many of the Black Canadian villages and hamlets in Ontario and Nova Scotia, some which were founded in the 18th century as Loyalist settlements, became abandoned as their inhabitants moved to the cities in search of work. In turn, the movement of Black Canadians to the cities brought them brutally face to face with racism as a series of informal &quot;Jim Crow&quot; restrictions governed restaurants, bars, hotels, and theatres while many landlords refused to rent to black tenants. In October 1937, when a Black man purchased a house in Trenton, Nova Scotia, hundreds of white people stormed the house, beat up its owner and destroyed the house under the grounds that a Black man moving into the neighbourhood would depress property values. Inspired by the unwillingness of the police to protect a Black man, the mob then destroyed two other homes owned by Black men, an action praised by the mayor for raising property values in Trenton, and the only person charged by the police was a Black man who punched out a white trying to destroy his home. Many Black Nova Scotians moved into a neighbourhood of Halifax that came to be known as Africville, which the white population of Halifax called &quot;Nigger Town&quot;.Segregation in Truro, Nova Scotia, was practiced so fiercely that its Black residents took to calling it &quot;Little Mississippi&quot;. The 1930s saw a dramatic increase in the number and activities of Black self-help groups to deal with the impact of racism and the Depression. Another change wrought by the Depression was a change in Black families as most married Black women had to work in order to provide for their families, marking the end of an era when only the husband worked.

In 1935, Eldridge &quot;Gus&quot; Eatman, a black man from Saint John, New Brunswick tried to raise an Ethiopian Foreign Legion to fight for Ethiopia, which was threatened with an invasion by Italy. Eatman&#x27;s call to defend Ethiopia drew an enthusiastic response to defend what the black lawyer Joseph Spencer-Pitt called &quot;the last sovereign state belonging to the coloured race&quot;. However, it appears that no volunteers actually reached Ethiopia.

===1940s and 1950s===

In the Second World War, Black volunteers to the armed forces were initially refused, but the Canadian Army starting in 1940 agreed to take Black volunteers, and by 1942 were willing to give Black officers commissions. Unlike in World War I, there were no segregated units in the Army and Black Canadians always served in integrated units. The Army was rather more open to Black Canadians rather than the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which both refused for some time to accept Black volunteers. By 1942, the RCN had accepted Black Canadians as sailors while the RCAF had accepted Black service members as ground crews and even as airmen, which meant giving them an officer&#x27;s commission as in the RCAF airmen were always officers. In 1942, newspapers gave national coverage when the five Carty brothers of Saint John, New Brunswick all enlisted in the RCAF on the same day with the general subtext being that Canada was more tolerant than the United States in allowing the Black Carty brothers to serve in the RCAF. The youngest of the Carty brothers, Gerald Carty, served as a tail gunner on a Halifax bomber, flying 35 missions to bomb Germany and was wounded in action.

The mobilization of the Canadian economy for &quot;total war&quot; gave increased economic opportunities for both Black men and even more so for Black women, many of whom for the first time in their lives found well-paying jobs in war industries.

In general racism became less fashionable during World War II with two incidents in 1940 illustrating a tendency towards increased tolerance as feelings of wartime national solidarity made displays of prejudice less acceptable. A Vancouver bar that refused to serve a Black man was fined by a judge when the said man complained. In Toronto a skating rink that turned away Black people found itself the object of a boycott and demonstrations by students from the University of Toronto until the owners of the rink finally agreed to accept Black patrons. The incidents in Toronto and Vancouver, as small as they were, would have been inconceivable ten or even five years before. Winks wrote that if the Second World War was not the end of racism in Canada, but it was the beginning of the end as for the first time that many practices that been considered normal were subject to increasing vocal criticism as many Black Canadians started to become more assertive.

In 1942, following complaints from Black university graduates that the National Selective Service board assigned them inferior work, a campaign waged by the &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot; newspaper, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; led to a promise from the National Selective Service board to stop using race when assigning potential employees to employers. During the war, unions became more open to accepting Black members and Winks wrote the &quot;most important change&quot; to Black Canadian community caused by World War II was &quot;the new militancy in the organized Black labor unions&quot;. The most militant Black unions was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which during the war won major wage increases for Black porters working on the railroads. In Winnipeg, a Joint Labor Committee to Combat Racial Intolerance was formed to end discrimination against Jews and Ukrainian-Canadians, but soon agreed to take cases concerning Black Canadians. In 1944, Ontario passed the Racial Discrimination Act, which banned the use of any symbol or sign by any businesses with the aim of racial discrimination, which was the first law in Canada intended to address the practice of many businesses of refusing to take Black customers.

In 1946, a Black woman from Halifax, Viola Desmond, watched a film in a segregated cinema in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, which led to her being dragged out of the theatre by the manager and a policeman. Desmond was convicted and fined for not paying the one cent difference in sales tax between buying a ticket in the white section, where she sat, and the Black section, where she was supposed to sit. The Desmond case attracted much publicity as various civil rights groups rallied in her defence. Desmond fought the fine in the appeals court, where she lost, but the incident led the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to pressure the Nova Scotia government to pass the Fair Employment Act of 1955 and Fair Accommodations Act of 1959 to end segregation in Nova Scotia. Following more pressure from Black Canadian groups, in 1951 Ontario passed the Fair Employment Practices Act outlawing racial discrimination in employment and the Fair Accommodation Practices Act of 1955, which outlawed discrimination in housing and renting. In 1958, Ontario established the Anti-Discrimination Commission, which was renamed the Human Rights Commission in 1961. Led by the American-born Black sociologist Daniel G. Hill, the Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission investigated 2,000 cases of racial discrimination in its first two years, and was described as having a beneficial effect on the ability of Black Canadians to obtain employment. In 1953, Manitoba passed the Fair Employment Act, which was modelled after the Ontario law, and New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and British Columbia passed similar laws in 1956, followed by Quebec in 1964.

The town of Dresden, Ontario was especially notorious for segregation with the majority of its Black residents living along two blocks on Main Street. In 1949, the journalist Sidney Katz wrote in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; the article &quot;Jim Crow Lives in Dresden&quot; that:&quot;...although Dresden citizens do not like to talk about it, Negroes cannot eat at the town&#x27;s three restaurants serving regular meals, cannot get a haircut in the four regular barbershops, cannot send their wives to the only beauty parlor&quot;. Katz found that the majority of businesses discriminated against Black Dresdeners because of the influence of Morley McKay, the outspokenly racist owner of the very popular Kay&#x27;s Grill restaurant, who vocally objected to any businesses that might open its doors to Black customers. McKay got around the Racial Discrimination Act of 1944 by simply refusing to allow Black customers to enter Kay&#x27;s Grill, a practice that was followed by many Dresden businesses who feared that McKay would organize a boycott by white customers. However, there was no segregation in Dresden&#x27;s schools, and Katz wrote it was common &quot;to see colored and while children walking the streets arm and arm&quot;.

To end segregation in Dresden, Hugh Burnett, a Black World War II veteran who owned a carpentry business in Dresden, founded the National Unity Association (NUA) in 1948. Most of leaders of the NUA were World War II veterans, who were incensed at the widespread discrimination in Dresden. After the all white council of Dresden dismissed Burnett&#x27;s demand that a non-discrimination clause be added to all business licences, Burnett formed an alliance with Kalmen Kaplansky, the president of the Jewish Labour Committee. Burnett and Kaplansky waged an effective media campaign highlighting the injustice of veterans being treated like second class citizens, and in 1949 met with the Premier, Leslie Frost, to press their case. Frost proved to be sympathetic and in response to the lobbying of Burnett and Kaplansky, toughened the Racial Discrimination Act in 1951, passed the Fair Employment Practices Act the same year, followed by the Fair Accommodations Act of 1954. When McKay continued to turn away Black customers from Kay&#x27;s Grill, he was convicted of racial discrimination. On 16 November 1956, two Black members of the NUA finally entered Kay&#x27;s Grill and were served without incident.

===1960s and 1970s===

On 21 March 1960, in the Sharpeville massacre, the South African police gunned down 67 Black South Africans protesting &quot;apartheid&quot;, which in a sign of changing racial attitudes caused much controversy in Canada. There was considerable public pressure on the Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to ask for South Africa to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the Sharpeville massacre with many noting that the South African prime minister Hendrik Verwoerd was an admirer of Nazi Germany. At the conference of the Commonwealth prime ministers in London in 1960, Diefenbaker tried to avoid discussing the subject of expelling South Africa, but at the next conference in London in 1961, he played a leading role in passing a resolution declaring racial discrimination incompatible with Commonwealth membership, which led to Verwoerd storming out of the conference and quitting the Commonwealth. The subject of condemning South Africa for &quot;apartheid&quot; benefited the Black Canadians since it suggested that racism was no longer acceptable anywhere in the Commonwealth at a time when Commonwealth membership mattered greatly to Canadians.

Canada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the British Empire in the Caribbean. The introduction of a Points-based immigration system in 1967 saw an increase in Caribbean immigration, particularly Black Barbadians. By the mid-1960s, approximately 15,000 Caribbean immigrants had settled in Toronto. Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbean people arrived, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Between 1950 and 1995, about 300,000 people from the West Indies settled in Canada. Outside of the Maritime provinces, where the majority of the black population are the descendants of black Loyalists and American runaway slaves, the majority of black Canadians are descended from immigrants from the West Indies. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. About 150,000 people from Africa immigrated to Canada between 1950 and 1995.

However, a sizeable number of Black Canadians who descend from freed American slaves can still be found in Nova Scotia and parts of Southwestern Ontario. Some descendants of the freed American slaves, many of whom were of mixed race descent, have mixed into the white Canadian community and have mostly lost their ethnic identity. Some descendants returned to the United States. Bangor, Maine, for example, received many Black Canadians from the Maritime provinces.
Like other recent immigrants to Canada, Black Canadian immigrants have settled preferentially in provinces matching the language of their country of origin. Thus, in 2001, 90 per cent of Canadians of Haitian origin lived in Quebec, while 85 per cent of Canadians of Jamaican origin lived in Ontario. A major change in the settlement patterns of black Canadians occurred in the second half of the 20th century as the mostly rural black Canadian communities had become mostly urban communities, a process starting in the 1930s that was complete by the 1970s. Immigrants from the West Indies almost always settled in the cities, and the Canadian historian James Walker called the black Canadian community one of the &quot;most urbanized of all Canada&#x27;s ethnic groups&quot;.

On 29 January 1969, at Sir George Williams University in Montreal, the Sir George Williams affair began with a group of about 200 students, many of whom were black, occupied the Henry Hall computer building in protest against allegations that a white biology professor, Perry Anderson, was biased in grading black students, which the university had dismissed. The student occupation ended in violence on 11 February 1969 when the riot squad of the &quot;Service de police de la Ville de Montréal&quot; stormed the Hall building, a fire was started causing $2 million worth of damage (it is disputed whether the police or the students started the fire), and many of the protesting students were beaten and arrested. The entire event received much media attention; it was recorded live for television by the news crews present. As the Hall building burned and the policemen beat the students, onlookers in the crowds outside chanted &quot;Burn, niggers, burn!&quot; and &quot;Let the niggers burn!&quot;. Afterwards, the protesting students were divided by race by the police with charges laid against the 97 black students present in the Hall building. The two leaders of the protest, Roosevelt &quot;Rosie&quot; Douglas and Anne Cools, were convicted and imprisoned with Douglas being deported back to Dominica after completing his sentence, where he later became prime minister. Cools received a royal pardon and was appointed to the Senate in 1984 by Pierre Trudeau, becoming the first black senator. The riot at Sir George Williams University spurred an ongoing wave of &quot;black power&quot; activism in Canada with many blacks taking the view that the police response was disproportionate and unjustifiably violent while many white Canadians who had believed that their country had no racism were shocked by a race riot in Canada.

In July 1967, the Caribana festival was started in Toronto by immigrants from the West Indies to celebrate West Indian culture that has become one of the largest celebrations of Caribbean culture in North America. In 1975, a museum telling the stories of African Canadians and their journeys and contributions was established in Amherstburg, Ontario, entitled the Amherstburg Freedom Museum. In Atlantic Canada, the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia was established in Cherry Brook.

Starting in the 1960s with the weakening of ties to Britain together the changes caused by immigration from the West Indies, black Canadians have become active in the Liberal and New Democratic parties as well as the Conservatives. In 1963, the Liberal Leonard Braithwaite became the first black person elected to a provincial legislature when he was elected as a MPP in Ontario. In the 1968 election, Lincoln Alexander was elected as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Hamilton West, becoming the first black person elected to the House of Commons. In 1979, Alexander become the first black federal Cabinet minister when he was appointed minister of labour in the government of Joe Clark. In 1972, Emery Barnes and Rosemary Brown were elected to the British Columbia legislation as New Democrats.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1984, the New Democrat Howard McCurdy was elected to the House of Commons as the second black MP while Anne Cools became the first black Senator. In 1985, the Liberal Alvin Curling became the second black man elected to the Ontario legislature, and the first black person to serve as a member of the Ontario cabinet. In 1990, the New Democrat Zanana Akande became the first black female MPP in Ontario and the first black woman to join a provincial cabinet as the minister of community services in the government of Bob Rae. In 1990, the Conservative Donald Oliver became the first black man appointed to the Senate. In 1993, Liberal Wayne Adams became the first black person elected to the Nova Scotia legislation and the first black Nova Scotia cabinet minister. In the 1993 election, Jean Augustine was elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal, becoming the first female black MPs.

A recurring point of tension in the Toronto region since the 1980s has concerned allegations of police harassment and violence against the black population in the Toronto area. After the killing of Lester Donaldson by the Toronto police in August 1988, the Black Action Defence Committee (BADC) was founded in October 1988 to protest al
legations of police brutality against black Canadians in Toronto. The founder of BADC, the Jamaican immigrant Dudley Laws became one of the most recognized figures in Toronto in the 1990s, noted for his willingness to confront the police. Alvin Curling told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2013: &quot;I think BADC raised the question that this wonderful looking society of Canada and Toronto, as organized as it was, had some systemic racism going on and police behaviour that was not acceptable.&quot; In April 1992, two white Peel Region police officers were acquitted for killing a 17-year black teenager, Michael Wade Lawson, who was riding in a stolen car, and then on 2 May 1992, a Toronto police officer killed a 22-year-old black man, Raymond Lawrence, claiming he was wielding a knife, through Lawrence&#x27;s fingerprints were not found on the knife that was found on his corpse.

On the evening of 4 May 1992, a march was held on Toronto&#x27;s Yonge Street by the BADC to protest the killings of Lawrence and Lawson together the acquittal of the police officers who had beaten Rodney King in Los Angeles that was joined by thousands of people who marched to the U.S. consulate in Toronto. After holding a sit-in in front of the American consulate, at about 9 pm, the protest turned violent as some of the protesters began to break windows and loot stores on Yonge Street, shouting &quot;No Justice No Peace!&quot;. Recently, what was widely described at the time as a race riot in Toronto had been relabelled by Brock university professor Simon Black as an &quot;uprising&quot; reflecting long-standing racial tensions in Toronto. However, other observers of the 1992 riot have described the majority of the looting and vandalism as done by white youths, leading to questions whatever it is appropriate to describe the 1992 riot as a &quot;race riot&quot;. The issue of police harassment of blacks in Toronto has continued into the 21st century. In 2015, the Toronto journalist Desmond Cole published an article in &quot;Toronto Life&quot; entitled &quot;The Skin I&#x27;m In: I&#x27;ve been interrogated by police more than 50 times – all because I&#x27;m black&quot;, accusing the police of harassing him for his skin colour.

With the secularization of society in late 20th century, the churches have ceased to play the traditionally dominant role in black Canadian communities. Increased educational and job opportunities have led to many black women to seek full-time careers. According to the census of 1991, black Canadians on average received lower wages than other Canadians. However, immigrants from the West Indies and Africa have usually arrived with high level of skills and education, finding work in numerous occupational categories. Efforts have been made to address the long-standing educational gap between black and white Canadians, and in the recent decades, black Canadians have been making economic gains.

===21st century===
On 5 June 2020, approximately 9,000 demonstrators gathered at the Alberta Legislature Building for the &quot;Fight for Equity&quot; rally which took place in response to the 25 May 2020 murder of George Floyd – an African-American who was killed during a police arrest.

In 2024, Statistics Canada reported that only 2.4% of Canadian businesses are Black-owned and, among these, 33% are led by women. Black-owned businesses are more likely to be owned by immigrants, younger people and the self-employed than non-Black-owned businesses.

==Settlements==

Although many Black Canadians live in integrated communities, a number of notable Black communities have been known, both as unique settlements and as Black-dominated neighbourhoods in urban centres.

The most historically documented Black settlement in Canadian history is the defunct community of Africville, a district located at the North End of peninsular Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its population was relocated and it was demolished in the 1960s to facilitate the urban expansion of the city. Similarly, the Hogan&#x27;s Alley neighbourhood in Vancouver was largely demolished in 1970, with only a single small laneway in Strathcona remaining.

The Wilberforce Colony in Ontario was also a historically Black settlement. It evolved demographically as Black settlers moved away, and became dominated by ethnic Irish settlers who renamed the village Lucan. A small group of Black American settlers from San Francisco were the original inhabitants of Saltspring Island in the mid-19th century.

Other notable Black settlements include North Preston, Sunnyville, Lincolnville, Tracadie and Upper Big Tracadie in Nova Scotia, Priceville, Shanty Bay, South Buxton and Dresden in Ontario, the Maidstone/Eldon area in Saskatchewan and Amber Valley in Alberta. North Preston currently has the highest concentration of Black Canadians in Canada, many of whom are descendants of Africville residents. Elm Hill in Hampstead Parish is the last remaining black community in New Brunswick.

One of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Canada is Montreal&#x27;s Little Burgundy, regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian jazz due to its association with many of Canada&#x27;s most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, LaSalle, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension, and Montréal-Nord have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population. Several cities in Greater Montreal such as Laval, Terrebonne, Repentigny and Châteauguay also have large Black populations.

In Winnipeg, the Central Park neighbourhood has the largest concentration of Black Canadians in Manitoba. Nearly 25 per cent of area residents are black, as of 2016. The Queen Mary Park and Central McDougall neighbourhoods form the centre of the black community in Edmonton. Queen Mary Park has been home to a long-standing African-American population since the early 1900s, centred around Shiloh Baptist Church in Edmonton, Alberta, although today the neighbourhood is composed mostly of recent migrants from Africa.

In Toronto, many Blacks settled in St. John&#x27;s Ward, a district which was located in the city&#x27;s core. Others preferred to live in York Township, on the outskirts of the city. By 1850, there were more than a dozen Black businesses along King Street; the modern-day equivalent is Little Jamaica along Eglinton Avenue, which contains one of the largest concentrations of Black businesses in Canada. First Baptist Church, founded in 1826, is the oldest Black institution currently operating in the city.

Several urban neighbourhoods in Toronto, including Jane and Finch, Rexdale, Downsview, Malvern, Weston, West Hill, Lawrence Heights, Mount Dennis, and Maple Leaf have large Black Canadian communities. The Toronto suburbs of Brampton and Ajax also have sizeable Black populations, many of whom are middle income professionals and small business owners. The Greater Toronto Area is home to a highly educated middle to upper middle class Black population who continue to migrate out of the city limits, into surrounding suburbs.

==Culture==

Media representation of Black people in Canada has increased significantly, with television series such as &quot;Drop the Beat&quot;, &quot;Lord Have Mercy!&quot;, &quot;Diggstown&quot; and &quot;Da Kink in My Hair&quot; focusing principally on Black characters and communities.

The films of Clement Virgo, Sudz Sutherland and Charles Officer have been among the most prominent depictions of Black Canadians on the big screen. Notable films have included Sutherland&#x27;s &quot;Love, Sex and Eating the Bones&quot;, Officer&#x27;s &quot;Nurse.Fighter.Boy&quot; and Virgo&#x27;s &quot;Rude&quot; and &quot;Love Come Down&quot;.

In literature, the most prominent and famous Black Canadian writers have been Josiah Henson, George Elliott Clarke, Lawrence Hill, Austin Clarke, Dionne Brand, Esi Edugyan and Dany Laferrière, although numerous emerging writers have gained attention in the 1990s and 2000s.

Since the late 19th century, Black Canadians have made significant contributions to the culture of sports, starting with the founding of the Coloured Hockey League in Nova Scotia. Boxer George Godfrey became one of the first Black Canadian sports stars by winning the World Colored Heavyweight Championship in 1883.

In North America&#x27;s four major professional sports leagues, several Black Canadians have had successful careers, including Ferguson Jenkins (Baseball Hall of Fame member), Grant Fuhr (Hockey Hall of Fame member), Jarome Iginla (Hockey Hall of Fame member), Russell Martin, Rueben Mayes, and Jamaal Magloire; most recently, Andrew Wiggins, RJ Barrett and P. K. Subban have achieved a high level of success. In athletics, Harry Jerome, Ben Johnson, and Donovan Bailey were Canada&#x27;s most prominent Black sprinters in recent decades; the current generation is led by Andre De Grasse. In 1912, Jerome&#x27;s grandfather, John Howard, became the first Black Canadian to represent Canada at the Olympics.
The largest and most famous Black Canadian cultural event is the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (also known as Caribana), an annual festival of Caribbean Canadian culture in Toronto which typically attracts at least a million participants each year. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent.

In 2021, the government of Canada officially recognized Emancipation Day, marking the abolition of slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, as a national observation for the first time. However, Black Canadians have already commemorated Emancipation Day with community events for decades. The annual Emancipation Festival has been held in Owen Sound, Ontario since 1862; an annual Emancipation Day festival in Windsor, Ontario was formerly one of the city&#x27;s largest and most prominent cultural events; and an annual &quot;Freedom Train&quot; event takes place in Toronto, symbolically commemorating the Underground Railroad with musical and spoken word performances taking place on a Toronto Transit Commission subway train from Union Station to Sheppard West. Since 2020, CBC Gem has also marked Emancipation Day with the annual &quot;FreeUp! The Emancipation Day Special&quot;, a televised edition of actress Ngozi Paul&#x27;s annual Black Canadian arts festival.

Black Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, R&amp;B, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Notable musicians in the early to mid-20th century include Garnet Brooks, Robert Nathaniel Dett, Portia White, Oscar Peterson, and Charlie Biddle. Some Black Canadian musicians have enjoyed mainstream worldwide appeal in various genres, such as Drake, The Weeknd, Daniel Caesar, Dan Hill, Glenn Lewis, Tamia, Deborah Cox, and Kardinal Offishall.

While African American culture is a significant influence on its Canadian counterpart, many African and Caribbean Canadians reject the suggestion that their own culture is not distinctive. In his first major hit single &quot;BaKardi Slang&quot;, rapper Kardinal Offishall performed a lyric about Toronto&#x27;s distinctive Black Canadian slang:

&lt;poem&gt;We don&#x27;t say &#x27;you know what I&#x27;m sayin&#x27;, T dot says &#x27;ya dun know&#x27;
We don&#x27;t say &#x27;hey that&#x27;s the breaks&#x27;, we say &#x27;yo, a so it go&#x27;
We don&#x27;t say &#x27;you get one chance&#x27;, We say &#x27;you better rip the show&#x27;...
Y&#x27;all talking about &#x27;cuttin and hittin skins&#x27;, We talkin bout &#x27;beat dat face&#x27;...
You cats is steady saying &#x27;word&#x27;, My cats is steady yellin &#x27;zeen&#x27;...
So when we singin about the girls we singin about the &#x27;gyal dem&#x27;
Y&#x27;all talkin about &#x27;say that one more time&#x27;, We talkin about &#x27;yo, come again&#x27;
Y&#x27;all talkin about &#x27;that nigga&#x27;s a punk&#x27;, We talkin about &#x27;that yout&#x27;s a fosse&#x27;...
A shoe is called a &#x27;crep&#x27;, A big party is a &#x27;fete&#x27;
Ya&#x27;ll takin about &#x27;watch where you goin!&#x27;, We talkin about &#x27;mind where you step!&#x27;&lt;/poem&gt;

In the mid to late 90s, certain words from Jamaican Patois and Somali were incorporated into the local variety of English by Toronto youth, specifically in diverse black communities, thus giving rise to Toronto slang (or Multicultural Toronto English). These examples included words such as &quot;bucktee, kawal, mandem&quot;, &quot;styll&quot;, &quot;wallahi&quot;, &quot;wasteman&quot;, and &quot;yute&quot;.

Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of &quot;creating&quot; a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture. For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred on the creation or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.

&quot;The Book of Negroes&quot;, a CBC Television miniseries about slavery based on Lawrence Hill&#x27;s award-winning novel, was a significant ratings success in January 2015.

In 2020, Black Canadian actors Shamier Anderson and Stephan James launched The Black Academy, an organization that will present awards to honour Black Canadian achievements in film, television, music, sports, and culture. The awards were presented for the first time in 2022.

In 2024, Ici Radio-Canada Télé premiered the comedy series &quot;Lakay Nou&quot;, the first Quebec television series about Black characters.

==Racism==
In a 2013 survey of 80 countries by the World Values Survey, Canada ranked among the most racially tolerant societies in the world. Nevertheless, according to Statistics Canada&#x27;s Ethnic Diversity Survey, released in September 2003, when asked about the five-year period from 1998 to 2002 nearly one-third (32 per cent) of respondents who identified as Black reported that they had been subjected to some form of racial discrimination or unfair treatment &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;often&quot;. Black Canadians face racism in both the public and private sectors of the Canadian economy. Both Black Canadian men and women endure significant wage gaps compared to non-visible minority Canadians. 

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, a number of unarmed Black Canadian men in Toronto were shot or killed by Toronto Police officers. In response, the Black Action Defence Committee (BADC) was founded in 1988. BADC&#x27;s executive director, Dudley Laws, stated that Toronto had the &quot;most murderous&quot; police force in North America, and that police bias against blacks in Toronto was worse than in Los Angeles. In 1990, BADC was primarily responsible for the creation of Ontario&#x27;s Special Investigations Unit, which investigates police misconduct. Since the early 1990s, the relationship between Toronto Police and the city&#x27;s black community has improved; in 2015, Mark Saunders became the first black police chief in the city&#x27;s history. Carding remained an issue as of 2016; restrictions against arbitrary carding came into effect in Ontario in 2017.

Throughout the years, high-profile cases of racism against Black Canadians have occurred in Nova Scotia. The province continues to champion human rights and battle against racism, in part by an annual march to end racism against people of African descent.

Black ice hockey players in Canada have reported being victims of racism.

==Incarceration==
Black Canadians have historically faced incarceration rates disproportionate to their population. In 1911, Black Canadians constituted 0.22 per cent of the population of Canada but 0.321 per cent in prison, compared to white Canadians incarcerated at a rate of 0.018 per cent. By 1931, 0.385 per cent of Black Canadians were in prison, compared to 0.035 per cent of white Canadians. Contemporary rates of incarceration of Black Canadians have continued to be disproportionate to their percentage of the general population. Per the 2016 Census, Black Canadians comprise 3.5 per cent of the national population, but Black inmates made up 8.6 per cent of the federal incarcerated population as of 2017.

<text>Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (13 February 1835 – 26 May 1908) was an Indian religious leader and the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam. He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the promised Messiah and &quot;Mahdī&quot;, in fulfillment of the Islamic prophecies regarding the end times, as well as the &quot;Mujaddid&quot; (centennial reviver) of the 14th Islamic century.

Born to a family with aristocratic roots in Qadian, rural Punjab, Ahmad emerged as a writer and debater for Islam. When he was just over forty years of age, his father died and around that time he claimed that God began to communicate with him. In 1889, he took a pledge of allegiance from forty of his supporters at Ludhiana and formed a community of followers upon what he claimed was divine instruction, stipulating ten conditions of initiation, an event that marks the establishment of the Ahmadiyya movement. The mission of the movement, according to him, was the reinstatement of the absolute oneness of God, the revival of Islam through the moral reformation of society along Islamic ideals, and the global propagation of Islam in its pristine form. As opposed to the Christian and mainstream Islamic view of Jesus (or Isa), being alive in heaven to return towards the end of time, Ahmad asserted that he had in fact survived crucifixion and died a natural death. He traveled extensively across the Punjab preaching his religious ideas and rallied support by combining a reformist programme with his personal revelations which he claimed to receive from God, attracting thereby substantial following within his lifetime as well as considerable hostility particularly from the Muslim &quot;Ulama&quot;. He is known to have engaged in numerous public debates and dialogues with Christian missionaries, Muslim scholars and Hindu revivalists.

Ahmad was a prolific author and wrote more than ninety books on various religious, theological and moral subjects between the publication of the first volume of &quot;Barahin-i-Ahmadiyya&quot; (The Proofs of Ahmadiyya, his first major work) in 1880 and his death in May 1908. Many of his writings bear a polemical and apologetic tone in favour of Islam, seeking to establish its superiority as a religion through rational argumentation, often by articulating his own interpretations of Islamic teachings. He advocated a peaceful propagation of Islam and emphatically argued against the permissibility of military Jihad under circumstances prevailing in the present age. By the time of his death, he had gathered an estimated 400,000 followers, especially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh and had built a dynamic religious organisation with an executive body and its own printing press. After his death he was succeeded by his close companion Hakīm Noor-ud-Dīn who assumed the title of &quot;Khalīfatul Masīh&quot; (successor of the Messiah).

Although Ahmad is revered by Ahmadi Muslims as the promised Messiah and Imām Mahdi, Muhammad nevertheless remains the central figure in Ahmadiyya Islam. Ahmad&#x27;s claim to be a subordinate (&quot;ummati&quot;) prophet &quot;within&quot; Islam has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream Muslims, who believe Muhammad to be the last prophet.

==Lineage and family==
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a descendant of Mirza Hadi Beg, a member of the Barlas tribe. In 1530, Mirza Hadi Beg migrated from Samarkand (present-day Uzbekistan) along with an entourage of two hundred people consisting of his family, servants and followers. Travelling through Samarkand, they finally settled in the Punjab, India, where Mirza Hadi founded the town known today as Qadian during the reign of Emperor Babur, his distant relative. The family were all known as Mughals within the British governmental records of India probably due to the high positions it occupied within the Mughal Empire and their courts. Mirza Hadi Beg was granted a Jagir of several hundred villages and was appointed the Qadi (judge) of Qadian and the surrounding district. The descendants of Mirza Hadi are said to have held important positions within the Mughal Empire and had consecutively been the chieftains of Qadian.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was born on 13 February 1835 in Qadian, Punjab, then part of the Sikh Empire under Ranjit Singh (). The surviving child of twins born to an affluent Mughal family. He learned to read the Arabic text of the Qur&#x27;an and studied basic Arabic grammar and the Persian language from a teacher named Fazil-e-Illahi. At the age of 10, he learned from a teacher named Fazl Ahmad. Again at the age of 17 or 18, he learnt from a teacher named Gul Ali Shah. In addition, he also studied some works on medicine from his father, Mirza Ghulam Murtaza, who was a physician. Ahmad&#x27;s father, Mirza Ghulam Murtaza, was a local chieftain () who served in the Sikh Army.

From 1864 to 1868, upon his father&#x27;s wishes, Ahmad worked as a clerk in Sialkot, where he would come into contact with Christian missionaries with whom he frequently engaged in debate. After 1868, he returned to Qadian, as per his father&#x27;s wishes, where he was entrusted to look after some estate affairs. During all this time, Ahmad was known as a social recluse because he would spend most of his time in seclusion studying religious books and praying in the local mosque. As time passed, he began to engage more with the Christian missionaries, particularly in defending Islam against their criticism. He would often confront them in public debates, especially the ones based in the town of Batala.

In 1886, certain leaders of the Arya Samaj held discussion and debate with Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam and asked for a sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ahmad travelled to Hoshiarpur upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as &quot;chilla-nashini&quot;. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu&#x27;ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.

===Taking of the &quot;Bay&#x27;ah&quot;===

Ahmad claimed divine appointment as a reformer as early as 1882 but did not take any pledge of allegiance or initiation. In December 1888, Ahmad announced that God had ordained that his followers should enter into a with him and pledge their allegiance to him. In January 1889, he published a pamphlet in which he laid out ten conditions or issues to which the initiate would abide by for the rest of his life. On 23 March 1889, he founded the Ahmadiyya community by taking a pledge from forty followers. The formal method of joining the Ahmadiyya movement included joining hands and reciting a pledge, although physical contact was not always necessary. This method of allegiance continued for the rest of his life and after his death by his successors.

===His claim===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed that he was the Promised Messiah and Mahdi. He claimed to be the fulfilment of various prophecies found in world religions regarding the second coming of their founders. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s followers say that he never claimed to be the same physical Jesus who lived nineteen centuries earlier. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed that Jesus died a natural death, in contradiction to the traditional Muslim view of Jesus&#x27; physical ascension to heaven and the traditional Christian belief of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. He claimed in his books that there was a general decay of Islamic life and a dire need of a messiah. He argued that, just as Jesus had appeared in the 14th century after Moses, the promised messiah, i.e. the Mahdi, must also appear in the 14th century after Muhammad.

In &quot;Tazkiratush-Shahadatain&quot;, he wrote about the fulfillment of various prophecies. In it, he enumerated a variety of prophecies and descriptions from both the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith relating to the advent of the Mahdi and the descriptions of his age, which he ascribed to himself and his age. These include assertions that he was physically described in the Hadith and manifested various other signs; some of them being wider in scope, such as focusing on world events coming to certain points, certain conditions within the Muslim community, and varied social, political, economic, and physical conditions.

===Post-claim===
In time, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s claim of being the (reformer) of his era became more explicit. In one of his most well-known and praised works, &quot;Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya&quot;, a voluminous work, he claimed to be the Messiah of Islam. Muslims have maintained that Jesus will return in the flesh during the last age. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, by contrast, asserted that Jesus had in fact survived crucifixion and died of old age much later in Kashmir, where he had migrated. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a military leader in the person of Jesus Christ as is believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he also rejected the idea of armed Jihad and argued that the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and tongue but not with the sword. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named &quot;Tuhfa-e-Qaiseriya&quot; and &quot;Sitara-e-Qaiseriya&quot; in which he invited Queen Victoria to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.

===Reaction of religious scholars===
Some religious scholars turned against him, and he was often branded as a heretic, but many religious scholars praised him like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad among many others who praised him for his defense of Islam. After his death, opponents accused him of working for the British government due to the termination of armed Jihad, since his claims of being the Mahdi were made around the same time as the Mahdi of Sudan (Muhammad Ahmad).

Following his claim to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, one of his adversaries prepared a Fatwa (decree) of disbelief against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declaring him a Kafir (disbeliever), a deceiver, and a liar. The decree permitted killing him and his followers. It was taken all around India and was signed by some two hundred religious scholars.

Some years later, a prominent Muslim leader and scholar, Ahmed Raza Khan, was to travel to the Hejaz to collect the opinions of the religious scholars of Mecca and Madina. He compiled these opinions in his work &quot;Husamul Haramain&quot; (The Sword of the Two Holy Mosques) in it, Ahmad was again labelled an apostate. The unanimous consensus of about thirty-four religious scholars was that Ahmad&#x27;s beliefs were blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy and that he must be punished by imprisonment and, if necessary, by execution.

===Journey to Delhi===
Ahmad went to Delhi, which was at the time considered a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding the life and death of Isa (Jesus), particularly Maulana Syed Nazeer Husain (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.

Eventually, it was settled, and Ahmad travelled to the Jama Masjid (main mosque) of Delhi accompanied by twelve of his followers, where some 5,000 people were gathered. Before the debate started, there was a discussion on the conditions, which led to the conclusion that the debate should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.

Upon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ahmad wrote his beliefs on a piece of paper and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of Bhopal, which was later published.

Ahmad is known to have travelled extensively across Northern India during this period of his life and to have held various debates with influential religious leaders.

===Challenge to opponents===
Ahmad published a book called &quot;The Heavenly Decree&quot;, in which he challenged his opponents to a &quot;spiritual duel&quot; in which the question of whether someone was a Muslim or not would be settled by God based on the four criteria laid out in the Qur&#x27;an, namely, that a perfect believer will frequently receive glad tidings from God, that he will be given awareness about hidden matters and events of the future from God, that most of his prayers will be fulfilled and that he will exceed others in understanding novel finer points, subtleties and deeper meanings of the Qur&#x27;an.

===The Sun and Moon eclipse===
After announcing his claim to be the Messiah and Mahdi, his opponents demanded that he should produce the &quot;heavenly sign&quot; detailed in the tradition attributed to the 7th-century Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, also known as Muhammad bin Ali, in which a certain sign is stated about the appearance of the Mahdi:

Ahmadis maintain that this prophecy was fulfilled in 1894 and again in 1895, about three years after Ahmad proclaimed himself to be the Promised Mahdi and Messiah, with the lunar and solar eclipse during the month of Ramadhan, according to the Ahmadiyya interpretation of the prophecy. Ahmad declared that this was a sign of his truth and was in fulfillment of the tradition or prophecy. The eclipses being a sign of the Mahdi are also mentioned specifically in the Letters of Rabbani by Ahmad Sirhindi.

Scientific historical records indicate these eclipses occurred at the following dates:

===Lawsuit===
In 1897, a Christian missionary, Henry Martyn Clark, filed a lawsuit of attempted murder against Ahmad at the court of District Magistrate Captain Montagu William Douglas in the city of Ludhiana. The charge laid against him was that he hired a man by the name of Abdul Hameed to assassinate Clark. However, he was not detained by the police and was declared innocent by the then-magistrate Captain Douglas.

===The Revealed Sermon===

In 1900, on the occasion of the festival of Eid ul-Adha, he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the &quot;Khutba Ilhamiyya&quot;, the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if in a trance, in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into prostration, followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.

Ahmad wrote later:
===Challenge to John Alexander Dowie===
In 1899, Scottish-born American clergyman John Alexander Dowie laid claim to be the forerunner of the second coming of Christ. Ahmad exchanged a series of letters with him between 1903 and 1907. Ahmad challenged him to a prayer duel, where both would call upon God to expose the other as a false prophet. Ahmad stated:

Dowie declined the challenge, calling Mirza Ghulam Ahmad the &quot;silly Mohammedan Messiah&quot;. Ahmad prophesied:
The challenge of &quot;prayer duel&quot; was made by Mirza in September 1902. The &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; states that after having been deposed during a revolt in which his own family was involved, Dowie endeavoured to recover his authority via the law courts without success and that he may have been a victim of some form of mania, as he suffered from hallucinations during his last illness. Dowie died before Mirza, in March 1907.

===Encounter with the Agapemonites===
In September 1902 the Rev. John Hugh Smyth-Pigott (1852-1927) proclaimed himself the Messiah and also claimed to be God while preaching in the Church known as &quot;The Ark of the Covenant&quot; in Clapton in London. This church was originally built by the Agapemonites, a religious movement founded by the Anglican priest Henry James Prince. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote to Smyth-Pigott, informing him that such a blasphemous proposition did not behove man, and that in the future he should abstain from making such claims, or he would be destroyed. This message was sent in November 1902. Newspapers in America and Europe published Mirza Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s notification. Despite this prophecy, Smyth-Piggot continued to claim divinity both before and after Mirza Ghulam&#x27;s death in 1908, as reported by various contemporary newspapers at the time.

===Last journey===
Towards the end of 1907 and early 1908, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to have received numerous revelations informing him of his imminent death. In April 1908, he travelled to Lahore with his family and companions. Here, he gave many lectures. A banquet was arranged for dignitaries where Ahmad, upon request, spoke for some two hours explaining his claims, teachings and speaking in refutation of objections raised against his person; here, he preached reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims. He completed writing his last work, entitled &quot;Message of Peace&quot;, a day before his death.

===Death===
Ahmad was in Lahore at the home of Dr. Syed Muhammad Hussain (who was also his physician), when, on 26 May 1908, he died from dysentery. His body was subsequently taken to Qadian and buried there; he had previously claimed that an angel had told him that he would be buried there. By the time of his death, he had gathered an estimated 400,000 followers, especially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh.

==Marriages and children==
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad married twice. His first wife was his maternal cousin Hurmat Bibi. When Ahmad remarried, they separated. 

===Children===
With his first wife, Hurmat Bibi, he had two sons:
#Mirza Sultan Ahmad (1853 – 2 July 1931) 
#Mirza Fazal Ahmad (1855 – 1904) 

With his second wife, Nusrat Jahan Begum, he had ten children, five of whom died in infancy:

#Ismat (15 April 1886 – July 1891)
#Bashir (7 August 1887 – 4 November 1888)
#Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad (12 January 1889 – 8 November 1965)
#Shaukat (1891 – 1892)
#Mirza Bashir Ahmad (20 April 1893 – 2 September 1963)
#Mirza Sharif Ahmad (24 May 1895 – 26 December 1961)
#(Nawab) Mubarika Begum (2 March 1897 – 23 May 1977)

#Amtul Naseer (28 January 1903 – 3 December 1903)
#(Nawab) Amtul Hafeez Begum (25 June 1904 – 6 May 1987)

==Legacy==
Although Mirza Ghulam Ahmad aroused much opposition particularly from Muslim leaders owing to his messianic claims, opinion of him was not entirely negative. Many leading Muslim scholars, theologians and prominent journalists who were his contemporaries or had come into contact with him, had, despite differing with him in matters of belief, praised his personal character and acclaimed his works in the cause of Islam and the manner of his argumentation against proclaimants of other religions. The teachings that Jesus survived crucifixion, migrating towards the east in search of the Israelite tribes that had settled there and that he died a natural death upon earth, as propounded by Ahmad, have been a source of ongoing friction with the Christian church since they challenge the core beliefs of Christianity and would nullify the doctrines of vicarious atonement and resurrection, the two principal tenets of Christianity. Western scholars and historians have acknowledged this fact as one of the features of Ahmad&#x27;s legacy.

Ahmad was the first to propose a &quot;post-crucifixion&quot; journey to India for Jesus and the first—other than the local people—to identify the Roza Bal shrine in Kashmir as the tomb of Jesus. These ideas have been further expanded upon since his death in light of subsequent findings, both by Ahmadis and individuals independent of the Ahmadiyya movement. However, the views remain controversial having been dismissed by some while being supported by others. Anthropological research tends to corroborate a link between the tribes of Israel and the peoples of south/central Asia, specifically the Pashtuns of Afghanistan and the people of Kashmir – as suggested by Ahmad in his book &quot;Jesus in India&quot; (and by others) – while findings from genetic evidence seem to remain equivocal. Jesus&#x27; survival of crucifixion and his natural death have become an important element of Ahmadi belief and Ahmadis have published extensively on this topic.

A number of modern Muslim scholars and Muslim intellectuals seem to conform to the idea of Jihad as fundamentally a peaceful religious endeavour rather than &quot;chiefly&quot; (or unconditionally) a militaristic struggle, in accordance with Ahmad&#x27;s standpoint on the issue. Furthermore, some Islamic scholars have opined that Jesus has died (Ahmad&#x27;s assertion) or have expressed their own confusion on this matter, though the majority orthodox position of most Muslims with regard to this issue has not changed.

One of the main sources of dispute during his lifetime and continuing since then is Ahmad&#x27;s use of the terms &quot;nabi&quot; (&quot;prophet&quot;) and &quot;rasul&quot; (&quot;messenger&quot;) when referring to himself. Most non-Ahmadi Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last of the prophets and believe that Ahmad&#x27;s use of these terms is a violation of the concept of the Finality of Prophethood. His followers fall into two factions in this regard. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, which comprises by far the majority of Ahmadis, believes that Ahmad&#x27;s prophetic status does not in any way infringe the finality of Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the Messiah in Islam. This group is currently headed by Ahmad&#x27;s fifth caliph, or successor, carrying the title of Khalifatul Masih, an institution believed to have been established soon after his death. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, which comprises a small fraction of all Ahmadis and believes in an allegorical understanding of these terms with reference to Ahmad, formed in 1914 when a number of prominent Ahmadis seceded from the main body soon after the election of Mirza Mahmud Ahmad as the second caliph. This group is administered by a body of people called the &quot;Anjuman Ishaat-e-Islam&quot; (&quot;Movement for the Propagation of Islam&quot;), headed by an Emir.

The movement initiated by Ahmad, which is often seen to have emerged as an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity widespread in 19th-century India, and is viewed by its adherents as embodying the promised latter day revival of Islam, has since grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme under the leadership of its caliphate. Although it has expanded to over 200 countries and territories of the world, numbering an estimated 10 to 20 million, it has received a largely negative (often hostile) response from mainstream Muslims who view Ahmad as a false messiah and his teachings as heretical, particularly the teaching that he was a prophet.

Pakistan is the only state that specifically requires every Pakistani Muslim to denigrate Ahmad as an impostor and his followers as non-Muslims when applying for a passport or a national ID card.

<text>Bangkok Airways plc () is a regional airline based in Bangkok, Thailand. It operates scheduled services to destinations in Thailand, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Laos, Maldives, and Singapore. Its main base is Suvarnabhumi Airport.

==History==
The airline was established in 1968 as Sahakol Air, operating air taxi services under contract from the Overseas International Construction Company (OICC), an American construction company, the United States Operations Mission (USOM), and a number of other organisations engaged in oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Thailand. It began scheduled services in 1986, becoming Thailand&#x27;s first privately owned domestic airline. It rebranded to become Bangkok Airways in 1989. The airline is owned by Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth (92.31 percent), Sahakol Estate (4.3 percent), Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (1.2 percent), and other shareholders (2.19 percent). At one point, it also wholly owned subsidiary airline Siem Reap Airways in Cambodia.

It built its own airport on Ko Samui, which opened in April 1989 and offers direct flights between the island and Chiang Mai, Hong Kong, Krabi, Pattaya, Phuket, and Singapore. The airline opened its second airport in Sukhothai Province in 1996. A third airport was built in Trat Province, opening in March 2003 to serve the tourism destination of Ko Chang.

The airline made its first foray into jet aircraft in 2000, when it started adding Boeing 717s to its fleet. Until that time, Bangkok Airways had flown propeller-driven aircraft, primarily the ATR 72. It had also operated the De Havilland Canada Dash 8, the Shorts 330 and for a short time a Fokker 100. The carrier added another jet, the Airbus A320, to its fleet in 2004.

Bangkok Airways planned to order wide-body aircraft as part of its ambition to expand its fleet but these plans to expand to the long haul market eventually fell short. It wanted to add its first wide-body jets in 2006 to serve longer-haul destinations such as the UK, India, and Japan and is looking at Airbus A330, Airbus A340 and Boeing 787 aircraft. In December 2005, Bangkok Airways announced it had decided to negotiate an order for six Airbus A350-800 aircraft in a 258-seat configuration, to be delivered to the airline commencing 2013 but the order of the aircraft was cancelled in 2011 due to the further delay of the Airbus plane.

In 2007, Royal Household Secretary General Kaewkwan Watcharoethai awarded Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth a royal warrant to display the Garuda emblem.

In 2017, Bangkok Airways received a new Air Operator Certificate, recertified to safety standards set out by ICAO from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand.

On 20 November 2024, it was reported that Bangkok Airways will be wet-leasing two aircraft from Amelia from 1 December 2024 to 29 March 2025 to overcome the shortage of aircraft especially during the upcoming peak tourist season in Thailand.

By late 2024 Bangkok Airways&#x27; current jet fleet of Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft were aging and the airline confirmed that it was evaluating both the Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jet E2 jets as possible replacements. The airline will soon put out a request for proposals from the manufactures for this potential order with deliveries intended to begin around 2028. 

==Financials==
For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2019, Bangkok Airways reported a profit of 351 million baht on revenues of 29,418 million baht. Its assets were valued at 61,908 million baht. BA lost 300 million baht during the first quarter of 2020, compared with a profit of 500 million baht a year earlier. Earnings have continued to decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the airline has asked for government assistance. As of 31 December 2019, BA employed 3,010 persons.

<doc id="466999" wikidata="Q5282090" url="?curid=466999" title="Discs of Tron">
<text>Discs of Tron is the second arcade video game based on the 1982 Disney film &quot;Tron&quot;. While the first &quot;Tron&quot; is a collection of four minigames, &quot;Discs of Tron&quot; is a single game inspired by &quot;Tron&quot;″s disc-battles. It is set in an arena similar to the one in the jai alai–style sequence.

In 2008, a port to the Xbox 360, via Xbox Live Arcade, by Backbone Entertainment was published by Disney Interactive Studios.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of &quot;Discs of Tron&quot; is based on several scenes in the &quot;Tron&quot; film, combining the jai alai-like combat between Flynn and Crom with the disc combat between Tron and Sark. The player controls Tron in a one-on-one battle with Sark, presented in a fixed three-dimensional view behind Tron. Using a control scheme similar to that of the original &quot;Tron&quot; arcade game, the player moves around with a joystick, throws discs using a trigger button, and defends with a thumb button. The player uses a rotary dial to move a targeting reticle around the arena walls, and in later levels the player can also pull up and push down on the knob to aim up and down.

Each match takes place in a closed arena on top of platforms made of concentric disks, like in the jai alai sequence. Tron and Sark attempt to destroy each other by either directly hitting their opponent or causing him to fall off his platform. Tron and Sark can each throw up to three discs at a time. Assuming it is not destroyed, each disc automatically returns to the player (destroyed discs regenerate). Tron can defend himself by hitting Sark&#x27;s discs with his own or by using a deflector, of which he has a limited supply. Sark can additionally attack Tron with high-speed missiles, chaser orbs, and &quot;super chasers&quot; (which consist of an orb and two orbiting disks), which cannot be deflected.

In later levels, platforms begin to move up and down vertically, requiring the player to aim up and down as well. Tron and Sark can bounce discs off the ceiling (similar to the energy ball in the jai alai sequence) with the goal of hitting one of their opponent&#x27;s platforms. If successful, the platform flashes briefly and then disappears, reducing the character&#x27;s movement or possibly causing him to fall and die. The platform reappears after about ten seconds. For some levels, a continuously scrolling wall of blocks appears between Tron and Sark; these blocks must be destroyed to open gaps in the wall before either character can hit the other.

The game has a total of twelve levels, with Sark becoming more aggressive throughout the game. Once the twelfth level is completed, levels repeat from six to twelve until the player runs out of lives.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s concept originated as a fifth minigame in the original &quot;Tron&quot;, which was cut due to time constraints. The concept was then repurposed for &quot;Discs of Tron&quot;, using more advanced hardware.

==Release==
This game was released just before the video game crash of 1983. In 2004, it was released again in the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Tron 2.0&quot;. Disney Interactive Studios released an updated port on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 in February 2008.

==Reception==
In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 87 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. Calling it &quot;one of the first games to attempt a 3D environment&quot;, they remarked that the fast-paced and complex gameplay works due to the responsive controls. They also praised the enemy AI as advanced for its time, though they complained that a head-to-head multiplayer mode was an obvious feature that had not been included.

===Xbox Live Arcade===
The Xbox Live Arcade version received &quot;unfavorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; gave it a favorable review, while its UK edition gave it a negative review, nearly a year before its release worldwide.

==Competition==
According to Twin Galaxies, David Bagenski of Syracuse, New York, United States, scored a world record 418,200 points on June 28, 1986, during the 1986 Video Game Masters Tournament.

<doc id="467001" wikidata="Q1068909" url="?curid=467001" title="Orient Thai Airlines">
<text>Orient Thai Airlines Co., Ltd. was an airline with its head office in Khlong Toei, Bangkok, Thailand. It operated charter and scheduled services in Southeast Asia and was based at Don Mueang International Airport. On 9 October 2018, the airline ceased all operations.

==History==
Orient Thai Airlines and its now-defunct wholly owned domestic carrier One-Two-GO Airlines are the only Thai airlines to bear a royal seal, made possible by the owner&#x27;s, Udom Tantiprasonchai, close relationship with the King of Thailand, based on Mr. Tantiprasongchai&#x27;s history of breaking traditional commercial barriers for Thailand. Prior to their current location, Orient Thai and its subsidiary One-Two-GO were headquartered in Don Mueang District, Bangkok.

On 22 July 2008, shortly after the crash of One-Two-GO Airlines Flight 269 in Phuket which killed 89 people, and after the Internet publication of illegally excessive work hours and check ride fraud, Orient Thai and One-Two-GO were ordered to suspend service for 56 days. 

On 22 September 2010, Orient Thai took delivery of its first Boeing 747-400 aircraft, previously registered as N548MD, and arrived at the Orient Thai base as HS-STC. In November 2015, Orient Thai Airways signed a contract with the Amadeus IT Group to be listed in Global Distribution Systems for the first time.

In early May 2016, the airline was sanctioned for the second time within a few weeks by the Civil Aviation Administration of China after violating regulations. In September 2017, Orient Thai Airlines temporarily suspended all operations. In December 2017, it resumed services after completing re-certification with the Thai aviation authorities.

By the end of July 2018, Orient Thai Airlines suspended all operations and entered a restructuring process. The airline later ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in October 2018. On 5 January 2021, Royal Gazette published an announcement declaring Orient Thai Airlines bankrupt and ordering the Legal Execution Department to seize its remaining assets to pay its debtors. Two weeks later, the founder of the airline died at age 66.

==Destinations==
As of November 2017, Orient Thai Airlines served the following scheduled destinations:

;Thailand
*Bangkok — Don Mueang International Airport (Base)

;People&#x27;s Republic of China
*Changsha — Changsha Huanghua International Airport
*Nanchang — Nanchang Changbei International Airport
*Shanghai — Shanghai Pudong International Airport

;Australia 
*Brisbane — Brisbane Airport

==Fleet==

During its history, Orient Thai Airlines operated a wide range of pre-owned aircraft:


==Incidents and accidents==
*September 2004: An Orient Thai Boeing 747 mistakenly flew within 200 meters of Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Tower over the heart of downtown Tokyo.

*31 July 2013: A chartered Orient Thai Boeing 737-400 operating as flight OX833 made an emergency landing at Surat Thani International Airport, carrying Chinese passengers from Shenzhen to Phuket. None of the 130 passengers and nine crew was injured.

<doc id="467003" wikidata="Q191170" url="?curid=467003" title="Fallujah">
<text>Fallujah ( ) is a city in Al Anbar Governorate, Iraq. Situated on the Euphrates River, it is located roughly to the west of the capital city of Baghdad and from the neighboring city of Ramadi. The city is located in the region defined as Sunni Triangle by the United States, as majority of its residents are Arabic-speaking Sunni Muslims. In 1947, Fallujah was a small town with a relatively small population but had grown to a population of about 250,900 people by 2018. 

Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which triggered the Iraq War, the city became a major centre of resistance during insurgency. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Iraqi Interim Government twice engaged in fierce urban combat with insurgents throughout the city; the first battle of Fallujah failed to dislodge the insurgents, triggering the second battle, in which the coalition forces successfully took control of the city. However, heavy fighting from these two battles left the city severely damaged, though it remained occupied by the coalition until 2011. In January 2014, three years after the American withdrawal from Iraq, Fallujah was captured by the Islamic State (IS) and suffered a major population decline. On 23 May 2016, the government announced the beginning of a large-scale military offensive against the IS militants occupying the city, resulting in the Third Battle of Fallujah. On 26 June 2016, the Iraqi Armed Forces stated that Fallujah had been fully liberated and was free from militant control.

Within Iraq, it is known as the &quot;city of mosques&quot; due to the 200+ mosques that can be found throughout the city as well as in the surrounding villages. 

==History==
The region has been inhabited for many millennia. There is evidence that the area surrounding Fallujah was inhabited in Babylonian times. The current name of the city is thought to come from its Syriac name, Pallgutha, which is derived from the word &quot;division&quot; or &quot;canal regulator&quot; since it was the location where the water of the Euphrates River divided into a canal. Classical authors cited the name as &quot;Pallacottas&quot;. The name in Aramaic is Pumbedita.

===Early history and middle ages===
The region of Fallujah lies near the ancient Sassanid Persian town of &quot;Anbar&quot;, in the Sassanid province of Asōristān . The word &quot;anbar&quot; is Persian and means &quot;warehouse&quot;. It was known as Firuz Shapur or Perisapora during the Sassanian Era. There are extensive ruins north of Fallujah which are identified with the town of Anbar. Anbar was located at the confluence of the Euphrates River with the King&#x27;s Canal, today the Saqlawiyah Canal, known in early Islamic times as the Nahr Isa and in ancient times as the Nahr Malka. Subsequent shifts in the Euphrates River channel have caused it to follow the course of the ancient Pallacottas canal. The town at this site in Jewish sources was known as Nehardea and was the primary center of Babylonian Jewry until its destruction by the Palmyran ruler Odenathus in 259. The Medieval Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela in 1164 visited &quot;el-Anbar which is Pumbeditha in Nehardea&quot; and said it had 3,000 Jews living there.

The region played host for several centuries to one of the most important Jewish academies, the Pumbedita Academy in the city of Pumbedita, which from 258 to 1038 along with Sura (ar-Hira) was one of the two most important centers of Jewish learning worldwide.Under the Ottoman Empire, Fallujah was a minor stop on one of the country&#x27;s main roads across the desert west from Baghdad.

===Modern era: 1900–2003===
In the spring of 1920, the British, who had gained control of Iraq after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, sent Lieut.-Colonel Gerard Leachman, a renowned explorer and a senior colonial officer, to meet with local leader Shaykh Dhari, perhaps to forgive a loan given to the sheikh. Exactly what happened depends on the source, but according to the Arab version, Gerard Leachman was betrayed by the sheikh who had his two sons shoot him in the legs, then behead him by the sword.

During the brief Anglo-Iraqi War of 1941, the Iraqi Army was defeated by the British in a battle near Fallujah. In 1947 the town had only about 10,000 inhabitants. It grew rapidly into a city after Iraqi independence with the influx of oil wealth into the country. Its position on one of the main roads out of Baghdad made it of central importance.

Under Saddam Hussein, who ruled Iraq from 1979 to 2003, Fallujah came to be an important area of support for the regime, along with the rest of the region labeled by the US military as the &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot;. Many residents of the primarily Sunni city were employees and supporters of Saddam&#x27;s government, and many senior Ba&#x27;ath Party officials were natives of the city. Fallujah was heavily industrialised during the Saddam era, with the construction of several large factories, including one closed down by United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in the 1990s that may have been used to create chemical weapons. A new highway system as a part of Saddam&#x27;s infrastructure initiatives circumvented Fallujah and gradually caused the city to decline in national importance by the time of the Iraq War.

During the Gulf War, Coalition warplanes repeatedly attacked a bridge in Fallujah which was used as part of an Iraqi military supply line. On 14 February 1991, a Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jet fired two laser-guided missiles which were aimed at the bridge but malfunctioned and instead struck Fallujah&#x27;s largest marketplace (which was situated in a residential area), killing between 50 and 150 non-combatants and wounding many more. After news of the mistake became public, an RAF spokesman, Group Captain David Henderson, issued a statement noting that the missile had malfunctioned but admitted that the Royal Air Force had made an error. Coalition warplanes subsequently launched another attack on the bridge, with one missile hitting its target while two others fell into the river and a fourth struck another marketplace in Fallujah, due to its laser guidance system once again malfunctioning.

=== Iraq War (2003–2011) ===

Fallujah was one of the least affected areas of Iraq immediately after the 2003 invasion by the US-led Coalition. Iraqi Army units stationed in the area abandoned their positions and disappeared into the local population, leaving unsecured military equipment behind. Fallujah was also the site of a Ba&#x27;athist resort facility called &quot;Dreamland&quot;, located a few kilometers outside the city proper. The damage the city had avoided during the initial invasion was negated by damage from looters, who took advantage of the collapse of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government. The looters targeted former government sites, the Dreamland compound, and the nearby military bases. Aggravating this situation was the proximity of Fallujah to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison, from which Saddam, in one of his last acts, had released all prisoners.

When the US Army entered the town in April 2003, they positioned themselves at the vacated Ba&#x27;ath Party headquarters. A Fallujah Protection Force composed of local Iraqis was set up by the US-led occupants to help fight the rising resistance. On the evening of 28 April 2003, a crowd of about two hundred people defied a curfew imposed by the Americans and gathered outside a secondary school used as a military HQ to demand its reopening. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne stationed on the roof of the building fired on the crowd, killing 17 civilians and wounding over 70. American forces claim they were responding to gunfire from the crowd, while Iraqi witnesses deny this version. Human Rights Watch also disputed the American claims and said that the evidence suggested the US troops fired indiscriminately and used disproportionate force.

On 31 March 2004, Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy containing four American private military contractors from Blackwater USA, who were conducting delivery for food caterers ESS. The four, armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerry (Jerko) Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were dragged from their cars, beaten, and set on fire. Their charred corpses were then dragged through the streets before being hung from a bridge spanning the Euphrates River. This bridge is unofficially referred to as &quot;Blackwater Bridge&quot; by Coalition Forces operating there. Photographs of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing outrage in the United States, and prompting the announcement of a campaign to reestablish American control over the city.

This led to an abortive US operation to recapture control of the city in Operation Vigilant Resolve, and a successful recapture operation in the city in November 2004, called Operation Phantom Fury in English and Operation Al Fajr in Arabic. Operation Phantom Fury resulted in the death of over 1,350 insurgent fighters. Approximately 95 American troops were killed, and 560 wounded. After the successful recapture of the city, U.S. forces discovered a room in which they claimed to find evidence of a beheading, and bomb-making factories, which were shown to the media as evidence of Fallujah&#x27;s important role in the insurgency against U.S. forces. They also found two hostages—an Iraqi and a Syrian. The Syrian was the driver for two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, who had been missing since August 2004. The Iraqi&#x27;s captors were Syrian; he thought he was in Syria until found by the Marines. Chesnot and Malbrunot were released by their captors, the Islamic Army in Iraq, on 21 December 2004.

The U.S. military first denied that it has used white phosphorus as an anti-personnel weapon in Fallujah, but later retracted that denial, and admitted to using the incendiary in the city as an offensive weapon. According to George Monbiot, reports following the events of November 2004 have alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, and a massacre by U.S. personnel. This point of view is presented in the 2005 documentary film, &quot;Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre&quot;. On 17 May 2011, AFP reported that twenty-one bodies, in black body-bags marked with letters and numbers in Latin script had been recovered from a mass grave in al-Maadhidi cemetery in the center of the city. Fallujah police chief Brigadier General Mahmud al-Essawi said that they had been blindfolded, their legs had been tied and they had suffered gunshot wounds. The Mayor, Adnan Husseini said that the manner of their killing, as well as the body bags, indicated that US forces had been responsible. Both al-Essawi and Husseini agreed that the dead had been killed in 2004. The US military declined to comment.

Residents were allowed to return to the city in mid-December 2004 after undergoing biometric identification, provided they wear their ID cards all the time. US officials report that &quot;more than half of Fallujah&#x27;s 39,000 homes were damaged during Operation Phantom Fury, and about ten thousand of those were destroyed&quot; while compensation amounts to twenty percent of the value of damaged houses, with an estimated 32,000 homeowners eligible, according to Marine Lt Col William Brown. According to NBC, 9,000 homes were destroyed, thousands more were damaged and of the 32,000 compensation claims only 2,500 have been paid as of 14 April 2005.

According to Mike Marqusee of &quot;Iraq Occupation Focus&quot; writing in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Fallujah&#x27;s compensation commissioner has reported that 36,000 of the city&#x27;s 50,000 homes were destroyed, along with 60 schools and 65 mosques and shrines&quot;. Reconstruction mainly consists of clearing rubble from heavily damaged areas and reestablishing basic utility services. 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January 2005, and 30% as of the end of March 2005. In 2006, some reports say two-thirds have now returned and only 15 percent remain displaced on the outskirts of the city.

Pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable; the nominal population was assumed to have been 250,000–350,000. Thus, over 150,000 individuals are still living as IDPs in tent cities or with relatives outside Fallujah or elsewhere in Iraq. Current estimates by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and Coalition Forces put the city&#x27;s population at over 350,000, possibly closing in on half a million. In the aftermath of the offensive, relative calm was restored to Fallujah although almost-daily attacks against coalition forces resumed in 2005 as the population slowly trickled back into the city. From 2005–06, elements of the New Iraqi Army&#x27;s 2nd and 4th brigades, 1st Division, occupied the city while the Marines maintained a small complex consisting of a security element from RCT8 and a CMOC at the city hall. The Iraqi units were aided by Military Transition Teams. Most Marine elements stayed outside of the city limits.

In December 2006, enough control had been exerted over the city to transfer operational control of the city from American forces to the 1st Iraqi Army Division. During the same month, the Fallujah Police Forces began major offensive operations under their new chief. Coalition Forces, as of May 2007, are operating in direct support of the Iraqi Security Forces in the city. The city is one of Anbar province&#x27;s centers of gravity in a newfound optimism among American and Iraqi leadership about the state of the counterinsurgency in the region. In June 2007, Regimental Combat Team 6 began Operation Alljah, a security plan modeled on a successful operation in Ramadi. After segmenting districts of the city, Iraqi Police and Coalition Forces established police district headquarters in order to further localize the law enforcement capabilities of the Iraqi Police. A similar program had met with success in the city of Ramadi in late 2006 and early 2007 (See Battle of Ramadi). Though the war and occupation ended in 2011, the insurgency continued.

=== Control by the Islamic State (2014–2016) ===

In January 2014, a variety of sources reported that the city was controlled by al-Qaeda and/or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS; sometimes called ISIL). On a broadcast of National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Middle East analyst Kirk Sowell stated that while ISIS was occupying parts of the city, most of the ground lost was to the tribal militias who are opposed to both the Iraqi government and al-Qaeda. More than 100 people were killed as Iraqi police and tribesmen battled militants who took over parts of two cities on Anbar province. On the same day, the Iraqi Army shelled the city of Fallujah with mortars to try to wrest back control from Sunni Muslim militants and tribesmen, killing at least eight people, tribal leaders and officials said. Medical sources in Fallujah said another 30 people were wounded in shelling by the army.

Despite various reports stating that ISIS was behind the unrest, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; journalist Dan Murphy disputed this allegation and claimed that while ISIS fighters have maintained a presence in the city, various tribal militias who sympathized with the ideas of nationalism and were opposed to both the Iraqi government and the ISIS controlled the largest share of area in Fallujah. A report from Al Arabiya also backed this claim and alleged that the relationship between the tribesmen and the ISIS militants was only logistical. On 14 January, various tribal chieftains in the province acknowledged &quot;revolutionary tribesmen&quot; were behind the uprising in Fallujah and other parts of Anbar and announced they would support them unless Maliki agreed to cease the ongoing military crackdowns on tribesmen.

Speaking on condition of anonymity at the end of May 2014, an Anbar-based Iraqi government security officer told Human Rights Watch that ISIS controlled several neighborhoods of southeast Fallujah as well as several northern and southern satellite communities, while local militias loyal to the Anbar Military Council controlled the central and northern neighborhoods of the city; however, Human Rights Watch stated that they could not confirm these claims. Despite the discussion over which groups initially controlled the city, Fallujah was mostly referred to as under ISIL/ISIS control during the occupation.

After beginning a campaign to liberate Anbar Governorate from ISIL in July 2015, in February 2016, the Iraqi army and its allies started to encircle the city in the Siege of Fallujah. On 22 May 2016, &quot;Operation Breaking Terrorism&quot; was launched to recapture Fallujah, marking the beginning of the Battle of Fallujah. On 22 May 2016, the Iraqi Army notified the remaining Fallujah residents of its plans to retake the city, and that such residents should either evacuate, or if not possible, to minimally raise a white flag over their roofs. Over the next several days, the army made advances on the city, capturing several surrounding villages on the outskirts on the town, killing a total of ~270 ISIL fighters, at least 35 members of Iraqi forces, ~40 civilians, and 1 Basij member, as of 1 June 2016.

On 30 May 2016, the military began to enter the city of Fallujah itself, but began to be stalled on 1 June, trying to attack ISIL members, but keeping the tens of thousands of civilians still trapped inside the city safe. However, by 3 June they began to make further advances on the city, killing 62 more ISIL militants. On 26 June, the Iraqi army reported that it had fully liberated the city, while fighting was ongoing in some pockets northwest of Fallujah which remained under ISIL control.

==Geography==
Fallujah&#x27;s western boundary is the Euphrates River. The Euphrates flows from the west (Ramadi), past Fallujah, and into the Baghdad area. When the river reaches the western edge of Fallujah, it turns north, then quickly south, forming what is commonly referred to as the &#x27;peninsula&#x27; area. There are two bridges that cross the Euphrates at Fallujah.

The city&#x27;s eastern boundary is Highway 1, a four-lane, divided superhighway that travels from Baghdad past Fallujah towards the west. After the sanctions imposed by the UN after the 1991 Gulf War, this highway became the main supply route for the country. Truckers and travelers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and southern Syria all merge onto this highway prior to entering the Eastern Al Anbar province. The highway has a prominent &#x27;cloverleaf&#x27; interchange with Highway 10 on the eastern edge of Fallujah. Highway 10, which also runs through Fallujah. It is a two-lane highway that turns into a four-lane highway once inside of Fallujah. The highway runs east-west from Baghdad through Fallujah then west towards Ramadi. A &#x27;cloverleaf&#x27; on-ramp allows for traffic on/off Highway 1. The highway basically splits the city into two halves, north and south.

The northern boundary is a railroad line that runs east-west just along the northern edge of the city. The line sits atop a 10–15 ft high berm all along the northern edge of the city, except where it crosses Highway 1.

There are three major hospital locations in Fallujah. The main hospital (formerly Saddam General) is located downtown, near the west end. The second is located across the Euphrates River in an area of west Fallujah commonly referred to as the &#x27;peninsula&#x27;, (due to its shape). The third hospital is the Jordanian Field Hospital located east of the Highway 10/Highway 1 interchange.

==Health effects of the Iraq War==
In 2010, an academic study had shown &quot;a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancer&quot; since 2004. In addition, the report said the types of cancer were &quot;similar to that in the Hiroshima survivors who were exposed to ionising radiation from the bomb and uranium in the fallout&quot;, and an 18% fall in the male birth ratio (to 850 per 1,000 female births, compared to the usual 1,050) was similar to that seen after the Hiroshima bombing. The authors cautioned that while &quot;the results seem to qualitatively support the existence of serious mutation-related health effects in Fallujah, owing to the structural problems associated with surveys of this kind, care should be exercised in interpreting the findings quantitatively&quot;.

<text>Kosmos 954 () was a reconnaissance satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1977. A malfunction prevented safe separation of its onboard nuclear reactor; when the satellite reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere the following year, it scattered radioactive debris over northern Canada, some of the debris landing in the Great Slave Lake next to Fort Resolution, NWT.

This prompted an extensive multiyear cleanup operation known as Operation Morning Light. The Canadian government billed the Soviet Union for over 6 million Canadian dollars under the terms of the Outer Space Treaty, which obligates states for damages caused by their space objects. The USSR eventually paid 3 million Canadian dollars in compensation.

==Launch and operation==
The satellite was part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s RORSAT programme, a series of reconnaissance satellites which observed ocean traffic, including surface vessels and nuclear submarines, using active radar. It was assigned the Kosmos number 954 and was launched on 18 September 1977 at 13:55 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, on a Tsyklon-2 carrier rocket. With an orbital inclination of 65°, a periapsis of and apoapsis of , it orbited the Earth every 89.5 minutes. Powered by a liquid sodium–potassium thermionic converter driven by a BES-5 nuclear reactor containing around 50 kg of highly-enriched uranium (over 90% uranium-235), the satellite was intended for long-term on-orbit observation, but by December 1977 the satellite had deviated from its designed orbit and its flightpath was becoming increasingly erratic.

In mid-December North American Aerospace Defense Command, which had assigned the satellite the Satellite Catalog Number 10361, noticed Kosmos 954 making erratic manoeuvres, changing the altitude of its orbit by up to 50 miles, as its Soviet operators struggled to control their failing spacecraft. In secret meetings, Soviet officials warned their US counterparts that they had lost control over the vehicle, and that the system which was intended to propel the spent reactor core into a safe disposal orbit had failed.

At 11:53 GMT on 24 January 1978, Kosmos 954 reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere while travelling on a northeastward track over western Canada. At first the USSR claimed that the satellite had been completely destroyed during re-entry, but later searches showed debris from the satellite had been deposited on Canadian territory along a path from Great Slave Lake to Baker Lake. The area spans portions of the Northwest Territories, present-day Nunavut, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

==Recovery==
The effort to recover radioactive material from the satellite was dubbed Operation Morning Light. Covering a total area of , the joint Canadian–American team swept the area on foot and by air in Phase I from 24 January 1978 to 20 April 1978 and Phase II from 21 April 1978 to 15 October 1978. They were ultimately able to recover twelve large pieces of the satellite, ten of which were radioactive. These pieces displayed radioactivity of up to 1.1 sieverts per hour, yet they only comprised an estimated 1% of the fuel. One fragment had a radiation level of 500 R/h, which &quot;is sufficient to kill a person ... remaining in contact with the piece for a few hours.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Under the terms of the 1972 Space Liability Convention, a state which launches an object into space is liable for damages caused by that object. For the recovery efforts, the Canadian government billed the Soviet Union Can$6,041,174.70 for expenses and additional compensation for future unpredicted expenses; the USSR eventually paid Can$3 million.

Kosmos 954 was not the first nuclear-powered RORSAT to fail; a launch of a similar satellite in 1973 failed, dropping its reactor into the Pacific Ocean north of Japan. Subsequently, Kosmos 1402 also failed, dropping its reactor into the South Atlantic in 1983. Subsequent RORSATs were equipped with a backup core ejection mechanism. When the primary mechanism failed on Kosmos 1900 in 1988, this system succeeded in raising the core to a safe disposal orbit.

Search teams did not find re-entry debris at the predicted location until they recalculated where that location would be based upon data indicating a stratospheric warming event had been in progress during re-entry. The stratospheric warming was first documented by the US Army Meteorological Rocket Network station at Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska.

===Pop culture===
Kosmos 954 has become a well known piece of history and lore in Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories. Yellowknife painter Nick MacIntosh has created works of art featuring the satellite and well known local landmarks.

The 28 January 1978, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a running gag about the radioactive debris from the crashed satellite having created giant, mutant lobsters heading for the U.S. east coast. The story concluded with them invading the television studio at the show&#x27;s end.

In November of 2022, an eight-episode podcast series titled &quot;Operation Morning Light&quot; was released. It was hosted by Dëneze Nakehk&#x27;o, a veteran Yellowknife-based Dené broadcast journalist, and produced by Aliya Pabani, and discussed the impact and aftermath of Kosmos 954 on the land and peoples where the debris fell.

<doc id="467009" wikidata="Q317422" url="?curid=467009" title="Eric Liddell">
<text>Eric Henry Liddell (; 16 January 1902 – 21 February 1945) was a Scottish sprinter, rugby player and Christian missionary. Born in Qing China to Scottish missionary parents, he attended boarding school near London, spending time when possible with his family in Edinburgh, and afterwards attended the University of Edinburgh.

At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Liddell refused to run in the heats for his favoured 100 metres because they were held on a Sunday. Instead he competed in the 400 metres held on a weekday, a race that he won. He became ordained as a Congregational minister in 1932 and regularly taught bible classes at Morningside Congregational Church, Edinburgh. He returned to China in 1925 and served as a missionary teacher. Aside from two furloughs in Scotland, he remained in China until his death in a Japanese civilian internment camp in 1945.

Liddell&#x27;s Olympic training and racing, and the religious convictions that influenced him, are depicted in the Oscar-winning 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, in which he is portrayed by fellow Scot and University of Edinburgh alumnus Ian Charleson.

==Early life==
Liddell was born 16 January 1902, in Tientsin, China, the second son of the Reverend and Mrs. James Dunlop Liddell, Scottish missionaries with the London Missionary Society. Liddell went to school in China until the age of five. At the age of six, he and his eight-year-old brother Robert were enrolled in Eltham College, a boarding school in south London for the sons of missionaries. Their parents and sister Jenny returned to China. During the boys&#x27; time at Eltham, their parents, sister, and new brother Ernest came home on furlough two or three times and were able to be together as a family, mainly living in Edinburgh.

At Eltham, Liddell was an outstanding athlete, earning the Blackheath Cup as the best athlete of his year, and playing for the First XI and the First XV by the age of 15, later becoming captain of both the cricket and rugby union teams. His headmaster, George Robertson, described him as being &quot;entirely without vanity.&quot;

While at the University of Edinburgh, Liddell became well known for being the fastest runner in Scotland. Newspapers carried stories of his feats at track events, and many articles stated that he was a potential Olympic winner.

Liddell was chosen to speak for the Glasgow Students&#x27; Evangelistic Union by one of the GSEU&#x27;s co-founders, D.P. Thomson, because he was a devout Christian. The GSEU hoped that he would draw large crowds to hear the Gospel. The GSEU would send out a group of eight to ten men to an area where they would stay with the local population. It was Liddell&#x27;s job to be lead speaker and to evangelise the men of Scotland.

==University of Edinburgh==
In 1920 Liddell joined his brother Robert at the University of Edinburgh to study Pure Science. Athletics and rugby played a large part in his university life. He ran in the 100-yard and 220-yard races for the university, and played rugby for the University Club. He played for Edinburgh District in the inter-city matches against Glasgow District of 3 December 1921 and 2 December 1922, from which he gained a place in the backline of a strong Scotland national rugby union team.

In 1922 and 1923, he played in seven out of eight Five Nations matches, and scored back-to-back tries in four appearances, which included wins over Ireland, France, and Wales. While his main weapon was his speed, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; opined after Scotland&#x27;s victory over Ireland in 1923 that &quot;never again should it be held against him that he is &#x27;only a runner&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;The Student&quot; wrote that Liddell had &quot;that rare combination, pace and the gift of rugby brains and hands&quot;. On the centenary of his first international cap against France in January 1922, Liddell was inducted into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame for his achievements.

Liddell became the national 110 yards champion and the national 220 yards champion after winning the AAA Championships titles at the 1923 AAA Championships. In the 100 yards he set a British record of 9.7 seconds that would not be equalled for 23 years.
He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree after the 1924 Summer Olympics in 1924.

On 15 July 2024, almost 100 years to the day after winning his 400 metre gold medal in Paris, the university awarded Liddell a posthumous degree of Doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot; in recognition of his contribution to sport and humanity. The degree was accepted by his daughter, Patricia Liddell Russell, who had travelled from Canada for the ceremony.

==Paris Olympics==
The 1924 Summer Olympics were hosted by the city of Paris. A devout Christian, Liddell withdrew from the 100-metre race (his best event), because the heats were going to be held on a Sunday. The schedule had been published several months earlier, and therefore his decision was made well before the Games. Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400-metre race, though his best pre-Olympics time of 49.6 seconds, set in winning the 1924 AAA championship 440-yard race, was modest by international standards. On the morning of the Olympic 400-metre final, 11 July 1924, Liddell was handed a folded square of paper by one of the team masseurs. Reading it later he found the message: &quot;In the old book it says: &#x27;He that honours me I will honour.&#x27; Wishing you the best of success always.&quot; Recognising the reference to , Liddell was profoundly moved that someone other than his coach believed in him and the stance he had taken.

The pipe band of the 51st Highland Brigade played outside the stadium for the hour before he ran. The 400-metre had been considered a middle-distance event in which runners raced round the first bend before coasting down the back straight. Inspired by the Biblical message, and deprived of a view of the other runners because he drew the outside lane, Liddell raced the whole of the first 200 metres to be well clear of the favoured Americans. With little option but to treat the race as a complete sprint, he continued to race around the final bend. He was challenged all the way down the home straight but held on to take the win. He broke the Olympic and world records with a time of 47.6 seconds. It was controversially ratified as a world record, despite being 0.2 seconds slower than the record for the greater distance of 440 yards.

A few days earlier Liddell had competed in the 200-metre finals, for which he received the bronze medal behind Americans Jackson Scholz and Charles Paddock, beating British rival and teammate Harold Abrahams, who finished in sixth place. This was the second and last race in which these two runners met.

His performance in the 400-metre race in Paris stood as a European record for 12 years, until beaten by another British athlete, Godfrey Brown, at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

After the Olympics and graduation from the University of Edinburgh, Liddell continued to compete. His refusal to compete on Sunday meant he had also missed the Olympic 4×400-metre relay, in which Britain finished third. Shortly after the Games, he ran the final leg in the 4×400-metre race in a British Empire vs. USA contest to help secure victory over the Americans, who had won the gold medal in Paris. A year later, in 1925, at the Scottish Amateur Athletics Association (SAAA) meeting in Hampden Park in Glasgow, he equalled his Scottish championship record of 10.0 seconds in the 100-yard race, won the 220-yard contest in 22.2 seconds, won the 440-yard contest in 47.7, and participated in a winning relay team. He was only the fourth athlete to have won all three sprints at the SAAA, achieving this feat in 1924 and 1925. These were his final races on British soil.

Because of his birth and death in China, some of that country&#x27;s Olympic literature lists Liddell as China&#x27;s first Olympic champion.

==Christian missionary work in China==

Liddell returned to Northern China to serve as a missionary, like his parents, from 1925 to 1943 – first in Tianjin and later in the town of Xiaozhang, Zaoqiang County, Hengshui, Hebei province, an extremely poor area that had suffered during the country&#x27;s civil wars and had become a particularly treacherous battleground with the invading Japanese.

During his time in China as a missionary, Liddell continued to compete sporadically, including wins over members of the 1928 French and Japanese Olympic teams in the 200- and 400-metre races at the South Manchurian Railway celebrations in China in 1928 and a victory at the 1930 North China championship. He returned to Scotland only twice, in 1932 and again in 1939. On one occasion he was asked if he ever regretted his decision to leave behind the fame and glory of athletics. Liddell responded, &quot;It&#x27;s natural for a chap to think over all that sometimes, but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m at the work I&#x27;m engaged in now. A fellow&#x27;s life counts for far more at this than the other.&quot;

Liddell&#x27;s first job as a missionary was at the Anglo-Chinese College (grades 1–12) for wealthy Chinese students. The school&#x27;s principal, Dr. Samuel Lavington Hart, who was educated at the University of Cambridge, had been a prominent physicist before founding the school in 1902. Dr. Hart believed that by teaching the children of the wealthy, he would help them become influential figures in China and promote Christian values. Liddell supported the school&#x27;s mission and began teaching mathematics and science at the school in 1925. Liddell also used his athletic experience to train boys in a number of different sports. According to one of Liddell&#x27;s former students, Yu Wenji, Liddell &quot;was very serious when protecting students&#x27; rights. He once quarreled with the headmaster to ask for more subsidies for students not from wealthy families.&quot; One of Liddell&#x27;s many responsibilities was that of superintendent of the Sunday school at Union Church, where his father was pastor. Liddell lived at 38 Chongqing Dao (formerly known as Cambridge Road) in Tianjin, where a plaque commemorates his residence. He also helped build the Minyuan Stadium in Tianjin.

During his first furlough from missionary work in 1932, he was ordained a minister of the Congregational Union of Scotland. On his return to China, he married Florence Mackenzie, of Canadian missionary parentage, in Tianjin in 1934. Liddell courted his future wife by taking her for lunch to the Kiesling restaurant, which is still open in Tianjin. The couple had three daughters, Patricia, Heather, and Maureen, the last of whom he would not live to see. The school where Liddell taught is still in use today. One of his daughters visited Tianjin in 1991 and presented the headmaster of the school with one of the medals that Liddell had won for athletics.

In 1941 life in China had become so dangerous because of Japanese aggression that the British government advised British nationals to leave. Florence (who was pregnant with Maureen) and the children left for Canada to stay with her family when Liddell accepted a position at a rural mission station in Xiaozhang, which served the poor. He joined his brother, Rob, who was a doctor there. The station was severely short of help and the missionaries there were exhausted. A constant stream of locals came at all hours for medical treatment. Liddell arrived at the station in time to relieve his brother, who was ill and needing to go on furlough. Liddell suffered many hardships himself at the mission.

===Internment===

As fighting between the Chinese Army and invading Japanese troops reached Xiaozhang, the Japanese took over the mission station and Liddell returned to Tianjin. In 1943, he was interned at the Weihsien Internment Camp (in the modern city of Weifang) with the members of the China Inland Mission, Chefoo School (in the city now known as Yantai), and many others. Liddell became a leader and organiser at the camp, but food, medicine, and other supplies were scarce. There were many cliques in the camp and when some rich businessmen managed to smuggle in some eggs, Liddell shamed them into sharing them. While fellow missionaries formed cliques, moralised, and acted selfishly, Liddell busied himself by helping the elderly, teaching Bible classes at the camp school, arranging games, and teaching science to the children, who referred to him as Uncle Eric.

It was also claimed that one Sunday Liddell refereed a hockey match to stop fighting amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later wrote a book about his experiences in the camp called &quot;The Courtyard of the Happy Way&quot; (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as &quot;The Campus of Loving Truth&quot;), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as &quot;the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. In all the time in the camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody&quot;. Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: 

Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance – absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known.
===Death ===

In his last letter to his wife, written on the day he died, Liddell wrote of suffering a nervous breakdown due to overwork. He had an undiagnosed brain tumor; overwork and malnourishment may have hastened his death. Liddell died on 21 February 1945, five months before liberation. Langdon Gilkey later wrote, &quot;The entire camp, especially its youth, was stunned for days, so great was the vacuum that Eric&#x27;s death had left.&quot; According to a fellow missionary, Liddell&#x27;s last words were, &quot;It&#x27;s complete surrender&quot;, in reference to how he had given his life to God. According to a different source, the 2007 documentary film &quot;Eric Liddell: Champion of Conviction&quot;, Liddell had been in and out of the camp hospital due to the brain tumor. One of his students, Joyce Stranks, came to visit him in the hospital to discuss a book he had written about surrender to God&#x27;s will. While discussing the book, Liddell reached a point when he was unable to complete saying the word &quot;surrender,&quot; and instead he said &quot;surren-...surren-&quot; and after this his head fell back to his pillow and he died.

==Legacy==
On 5 June 1945 the Eric Liddell Memorial Committee was set up in Glasgow, to seek donations for a fund to provide for the education and maintenance of Eric Liddell&#x27;s three daughters; to fund an Eric Liddell Missionary Scholarship at the University of Edinburgh and an Eric Liddell Challenge Trophy for Amateur Athletics; and to erect a memorial in North China to commemorate Eric Liddell&#x27;s work there. Only the first and third objectives were achieved. To raise funds and to widen its appeal, the committee published a pamphlet by D.P. Thomson: &quot;Eric Liddell, The Making of an Athlete and the Training of a Missionary&quot;. The Fund was eventually wound up in 1954, having raised £3,687 15s - over £88,000 in relative purchasing power. D.P. Thomson also spoke at well-attended memorial services held in both Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1945.

When Scotsman Allan Wells won the 100-metre sprint at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, 56 years after the 1924 Paris Olympics, he was asked if he had run the race for Harold Abrahams, the last 100-metre Olympic winner from Britain (who had died two years previously). &quot;No&quot;, Wells replied. &quot;I would prefer to dedicate this to Eric Liddell&quot;.

In 2002, when the first inductees were inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame, Eric Liddell topped the public vote for the most popular sporting hero Scotland had ever produced. Liddell was inducted into the Scottish Rugby Hall of Fame in January 2022, on the centenary of his first international cap.

In 2008, just before the Beijing Olympics, Chinese authorities claimed that Liddell had refused an opportunity to leave the camp, and instead gave his place to a pregnant woman. Apparently, the Japanese and British, with Churchill&#x27;s approval, had agreed upon a prisoner exchange. However, his friends and those who had lived with him in the camp disputed the claim.

===Weifang Memorial===
Liddell was buried in the garden behind the Japanese officers&#x27; quarters, his grave marked by a small wooden cross. The site was forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1989, in the grounds of what is now Weifang Middle School in Shandong Province, north-east China, south of Beijing. Its rediscovery was largely the result of the determination of Charles Walker, a civil engineer working in Hong Kong, who felt that one of Scotland&#x27;s great heroes was in danger of being forgotten. Walker began looking for the unmarked grave in 1987, and eventually located it from a map drawn by another inmate in 1945, and the accounts of other witnesses who confirmed the location.

In 1991 the University of Edinburgh erected a memorial headstone, made from Isle of Mull granite and carved by a mason in Tobermory, at the former camp site in Weifang. The simple inscription came from the Book of Isaiah 40:31: &quot;They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary.&quot; The city of Weifang commemorated Liddell during the 60th anniversary of the internment camp&#x27;s liberation by laying a wreath on his grave.

===Other honours===

The Eric Liddell Centre was set up in Edinburgh in 1980 to honour Liddell&#x27;s beliefs in community service whilst he lived and studied in Edinburgh. Local residents dedicated it to inspiring, empowering, and supporting people of all ages, cultures, and abilities, as an expression of compassionate Christian values.

Eltham College&#x27;s sports centre was named &quot;Eric Liddell Sports Centre&quot; in his memory.

In 2012 the University of Edinburgh launched a high-performance sports scholarship named after Liddell. It was announced during a visit by Patricia Russell, Liddell&#x27;s oldest daughter.

In 2023 the Eric Liddell Gym, a fitness centre at the University of Edinburgh, was opened and in 2024 the University awarded Liddell a posthumous honorary doctorate to mark the 100th anniversary of his success at the Paris Olympics. The award ceremony took place in the same hall from which Liddell graduated in 1924.

In 2024 a footpath on Bruntsfield Links was renamed the Eric Liddell Way in honour of the athlete.

==Portrayals on film, TV and stage==
* The Oscar-winning 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; revolves around Liddell and fellow sprinter Harold Abrahams. In it, Liddell is portrayed by Ian Charleson.
* In the 2007 film series &quot;The Torchlighters: Heroes of the Faith&quot;, Eric Liddell is portrayed in the film &quot;The Eric Liddell story&quot;, depicting his life and work as a Christian missionary.
* In 2012, the play &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, based on the 1981 film, starred Jack Lowden as Liddell.
* A 2016 film, &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; (Chinese name 终极胜利, original English name &quot;The Last Race&quot;), produced by Beijing Forbidden City Studio, directed by Hong Kong director Stephen Shin, stars Joseph Fiennes as Liddell, and portrays his return to China and the rest of his life after the 1924 Olympics.

===&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;===
The 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; chronicles and contrasts the lives and viewpoints of Liddell and Harold Abrahams. One inaccuracy surrounds Liddell&#x27;s refusal to race in the 100-metre event at the 1924 Paris Summer Olympics. The film portrays Liddell as finding out that one of the heats was to be held on a Sunday as he boards the boat that will take the British Olympic team across the English Channel to Paris. In reality, the schedule and Liddell&#x27;s decision were both known several months in advance, though his refusal to participate remains significant. Liddell had also been selected to run as a member of the 4×100-metre and 4×400-metre relay teams at the Olympics, but he also declined these spots as the finals were to be run on a Sunday.

One scene in the film depicts Liddell falling early in a 440-yard race in a Scotland–France dual meet and making up a 20-yard deficit to win; the actual race was during a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. Liddell was knocked to the ground several strides into the race. He hesitated, got up and pursued his opponents, 20 yards ahead. He caught the leaders shortly before the finish line and collapsed after crossing the tape. This scene was filmed at Goldenacre stadium in Edinburgh, the playing fields of George Heriot&#x27;s School in Edinburgh.

Producer David Puttnam viewed footage from a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with scriptwriter Colin Welland, and Liddell&#x27;s unorthodox running style as portrayed in the film, with his head back and his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440-yard final, in which Liddell was a long way behind the leaders at the start of the last lap (of a 220-yard track), remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, &quot;His head&#x27;s no&#x27; back yet.&quot; Liddell then threw his head back and, with mouth wide open, caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924, his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter.&quot; Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell&#x27;s style: &quot;People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there.&quot;

<doc id="467011" wikidata="Q678806" url="?curid=467011" title="Abstraction inversion">
<text>In computer programming, abstraction inversion is an anti-pattern arising when users of a construct need functions implemented within it but not exposed by its interface. The result is that the users re-implement the required functions in terms of the interface, which in its turn uses the internal implementation of the same functions. This may result in implementing lower-level features in terms of higher-level ones, thus the term &#x27;abstraction inversion&#x27;.

Possible ill-effects are:
* The user of such a re-implemented function may seriously underestimate its running-costs.
* The user of the construct is forced to obscure their implementation with complex mechanical details.
* Many users attempt to solve the same problem, increasing the risk of error.

== Examples ==
Alleged examples from professional programming circles include:
* In Ada, choice of the &quot;rendezvous&quot; construct as a synchronisation primitive forced programmers to implement simpler constructs such as semaphores on the more complex basis.
* In Applesoft BASIC, integer arithmetic was implemented on top of floating-point arithmetic, and there were no bitwise operators and no support for blitting of raster graphics (even though the language supported vector graphics on the Apple II&#x27;s raster hardware). This caused games and other programs written in BASIC to run slower.
* Like Applesoft BASIC, Lua has a floating-point type as its sole numeric type when configured for desktop computers, and it had no bitwise operators prior to Lua 5.2.
* Creating an object to represent a function is cumbersome in object-oriented languages such as Java and C++ (especially prior to C++11 and Java 8), in which functions are not first-class objects. In C++ it is possible to make an object &#x27;callable&#x27; by overloading the codice_1 operator, but it is still often necessary to implement a new class, such as the &quot;Functors in the STL&quot;. (C++11&#x27;s lambda function makes it much easier to create an object representing a function.)
* Tom Lord has suggested that Subversion version control system pays for the abstraction inversion of implementing a write-only database on a read/write database with poor performance.
* Using stored procedures to manipulate data in a relational database, without granting programmers right to deploy such procedures, leads to reimplementing queries outside the database. For example, large datasets (in extreme cases - whole tables) are fetched and actual filtering takes place in application code. Alternatively, thousands of rows are updated (inserted or even fetched) one by one instead of running a multiple row query.
* Microsoft&#x27;s WinUI 3 systematically replaces the title bar of the windows it creates with a custom one that ignores the end-user&#x27;s color settings, always appearing gray instead. Applying the end-user&#x27;s chosen color to the title bar requires using further customization code on Windows 11, and completely replacing the custom title bar with another custom one on Windows 10.

Examples that are common outside professional programming circles include:

* Using spreadsheet lookup functions to replicate the functionality of a database
* Using variant data types as loop counters in Microsoft Visual Basic where an integer type is also available.

<doc id="467018" wikidata="Q3109641" url="?curid=467018" title="Music of Timor-Leste">
<text>Timor-Leste&#x27;s music reflects its history under the control of both Portugal and Indonesia, who have imported music like gamelan and fado. The most widespread form of native folk music was the likurai dance, performed by women to welcome home men after war. They used a small drum and sometimes carried enemy heads in processions through villages; a modern version of the dance is used by women in courtship.

In the modern era, East Timorese music has been closely associated with the independence movement; for example, the band Dili Allstars released a song that became an anthem in the build-up to the referendum on independence in 2000, while the United Nations commissioned a song called &quot;Hakotu Ba&quot; (by Lahane) to encourage people to register to vote in the referendum.

East Timorese popular musicians include Teo Batiste Ximenes, who grew up in Australia and uses folk rhythms from his homeland in his music . With many East Timorese people in emigrant communities in Australia, Portugal and elsewhere, East Timorese folk music has been brought to many places around the world. Refugee camps in Portugal mixed together East Timorese music with styles from other Portuguese colonies like Angola and Mozambique .

Music and dance are intertwined in the traditional Timorese genres, being fundamental elements of cultural expression. The repertoire played includes four well-defined genres: &quot;tebe&quot;, &quot;tebedai&quot;, &quot;dansa&quot; and &quot;cansaun&quot;. All are based on oral tradition and have been passed down from generation to generation.

==Instruments==

Musical instruments, costumes and adornments also play an important role in musical performance. Of the first, babadok and dadir (also dadil, gong or gon) stand out. The babadok is a small tapered wooden drum, about 30 to 50 centimeters long and about 15 centimeters in diameter, generally played by the women that strike it alternately with both hands. The dadir is a metal circle approximately 25 centimeters in diameter, which is struck with a wooden stick, of indefinite height and without the possibility of tuning. Like babadok, it is also an instrument played by women. 

The performed musical repertoire also includes violas and soprano flutes, western instruments introduced in the Timorese performance. As far as suits are concerned, they are made up of such mane and fetus, male and female, respectively. Such are multicolored cloths manufactured by hand in Timor-Leste, which men wrap around the waist and which women place around the body, under the armpits. The men put a scarf on their heads over which they apply kaibauk, a metal moon with applications of small tears and ears, the largest and most ornate belonging to the traditional Timorese liurai, chief or king. The surik, a warrior sword, and the belak, a metal disc suspended from the chest, complete the men&#x27;s attire. Women use kaibauk, in addition to ulum suku, to hold their hair in, and sasuit, a long-toothed comb. They usually wear mortene, a necklace made of different materials, and a white cloth around their waist. Finally, the lokum or kelui, a metal bracelet worn by men on the arm and women on the forearm. All the elements work barefoot and with a salenda, shawl made with the same type of handmade cloth, placed on the shoulders.

The guitar has long been an important part of East Timorese music, though it is an import brought by colonisers; there are, however, native kinds of string instruments similar in some ways to the guitar. Foreign influences also include popular styles of music like rock and roll, hip hop and reggae .

Lyrics of the songs can be sung in Tetum or Portuguese, official languages of Timor-Leste.

<doc id="467020" wikidata="Q3642719" url="?curid=467020" title="Idols South Africa">
<text>Idols was a television show on the South African television network Mzansi Magic, and previously on M-Net, based on the popular British show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. The show was a contest to determine the best young singer in South Africa.

The general format of the show is that thousands of hopeful performers from across South Africa auditioned in front of the judges. They were narrowed down to approximately 100 to enter the theatre rounds. They performed in group and solo rounds until 16 finalists are chosen by the judges (usually 8 males and 8 females). From these, the top 10 are selected, then each week, viewers had several hours following the broadcast of the previous episode to vote by phone, SMS or online for their favourite contestant. The contestant(s) with the fewest votes was sent home each week.

It was presented by Candy Litchfield and Matthew Stewardson in the first season. Halfway through the season, Stewardson was replaced by Sami Sabiti. After Colin Moss and Letoya Makhene co-hosted the second season, Moss went solo for the third and fourth seasons. Liezl van der Westhuizen became the host in the fifth season, and was sidekicked by ProVerb in the sixth season who hosted the semi-final rounds. ProVerb became the sole presenter from the seventh season until the nineteenth season.

Randall Abrahams, Dave Thompson, Marcus Brewster and Penny Lebyane were the judges in the first season. Judges provide critiques of each contestant&#x27;s performance. Brewster and Lebyane did not return for the second season and were replaced by Mara Louw-Thomson and Gareth Cliff.Unathi Nkayi replaced Louw-Thomson in the seventh season. Somizi Mhlongo was added to the judging panel in the eleventh season. Cliff left the show after the twelfth season. After several seasons as judges, Abrahams and Nkayi did return for the eighteenth season. In February 2022, Thembi Seete and JR replaced the two until the nineteenth season.

In February 2023, it was announced that the nineteenth season would be the last season of the competition.

In 2006, the show had a spin-off called &quot;Afrikaanse Idols&quot; on sister channel Kyknet, where exactly the same format was executed. However, the entire programme was in Afrikaans as well as the songs that were performed. There was only one season due to low ratings. The judges were Mynie Grové, Deon Maas and Taliep Petersen, while the presenter was Sean Paul

== Season synopsis ==

=== Season 1 ===

The first season of South African &quot;Idols&quot; started in March 2002. Auditions were held prior in January. After Poland, it was the second international spin-off of the original Pop Idol series that went on air. However, the South African show did last shorter than the Polish version and therefore Heinz Winckler became the second Idol winner worldwide on 17 June 2002. He triumphed over Brandon October who came second and Melanie Lowe who finished third.

=== Season 2 ===

The second season ran from June to October 2003 and was won by then 20-year-old Anke Pietrangeli who was given the nickname &quot;The Kimberlite&#x27; by the viewers during the show.

Half of the judging panel were replaced as were the two hosts, with Colin Moss and Letoya Makhene now hosting. It was also the first time worldwide on an &quot;Idol&quot; show that only two male singers managed to advance to the top 12.

=== Season 3 ===

The third season aired in the second half of 2005 with an unchanged judging panel and Colin Moss as the only host of the show. The Grand Final took place at Gold Reef City, Johannesburg on 27 November 2005 between Karin Kortje and Gift Gwe. Each contestant sang a favourite song chosen by them, a favourite song chosen by the judges, and a brand new single. After a record number of votes cast, Karin Kortje was crowned as the 2005 Idol with 62.58% of the votes.

=== Afrikaans season ===

In 2006, the English format of &quot;Idols&quot; took a break to make room for the Afrikaans version. The Afrikaans &quot;Idols&quot; season represented a unique change in Idols format on a global scale by replacing all previous judges and hosts, moving networks (M-Net to sister station KykNet) and therefore changing the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the show from English to Afrikaans as KykNET is solely an Afrikaans network.

=== Season 4 ===

On 13 April 2007, M-Net announced the series would return to their network for a fourth season in English. The initial auditions were completed on 6 August with the judging and public vote stages due to start on 19 August. The results from each show display a merge of the judges (49%) and audience (51%) vote. Jody Williams, a 17-year-old from Cape Town, emerged as the eventual winner. Her best performances included moving ballads such as &quot;Greatest Reward&quot; by Celine Dion and &quot;Dance with my Father&quot; by Luther Vandross. However, she proved her versatility and impressed the judges with excellent renditions of more up-tempo songs such as &quot;Dance with Somebody&quot; by Whitney Houston and &quot;Ain&#x27;t no Other Man&quot; by Christina Aguilera. Her first single, which she and fellow finalist, Andriëtte Norman, performed at the finale, was called &quot;Love is All Around&quot; and was sold out the day after the finale.

=== Season 5 ===
M-Net announced a fifth season of South African &quot;Idols&quot; which premiered on Sunday, 1 February 2009, with a summer vibe and new rules.

In addition to upping the heat of the selection process the strict &quot;a capella&quot; rule was abandoned. Instead, auditioners were allowed to bring instruments to the casting. The judges did not seem too pleased with the instruments, especially guitars which were very rarely played in tune.

On the official finale, Sasha-Lee Davids was announced the winner, with 52.77% of the votes. Four days later, Idols announced that there had been problems with the voteline, and some of the votes that were sent before the cut-off time were not counted. The investigation hit the front page of the &quot;Times&quot; on 8 May 2009 and later in the day it was announced on the Idols website that the recount had showed that Jason Hartman had received 200000 more votes than Sasha-Lee Davids(of 2.3 million total votes in the finale (recount)). After discussion between M-Net and FremantleMedia (the format owners), Jason Hartman and Sasha-Lee Davids were declared winners. They both received identical full prizes.

=== Season 6 ===

Despite the previous seasons voting fiasco in the finale, M-Net announced a sixth season of South African &quot;Idols&quot; which premiered on 18 July 2010. Idols judge Dave Thompson did not return to the panel this season. During the auditions, which started in April, he was replaced with guest judges from the South African music industry, similar to the American Idol (Season 9) audition stages.

For the first time since the second season, the jury has no impact on the outcome which now reflected a 100% viewer&#x27;s verdict. On 2 November 2010, 30-year-old Elvis Blue from George in the Western Cape was declared the winner.

=== Season 7 ===

It was announced during the sixth season finale that the show had been renewed for a seventh season in 2011. Auditions took place in February and March 2011. On 20 January 2011, it was announced that Mara Louw would not return to the judging panel for the seventh season. The decision came after she was reprimanded for drinking a mix of painkillers and alcohol before a show. She was also involved in a racism scandal after she said the show should be moved to SABC3 so that a black person could win Idols, as many black people did not have DStv and could not send hundreds of SMSes to vote for their favourites. She was replaced by media personality and singer-songwriter Unathi Nkayi. On 4 October 2011, Dave Van Vuuren from Johannesburg in Gauteng was declared the winner.

=== Season 8 ===

It was announced on 9 January 2012 that the show had been renewed for an eighth season in 2012. Nationwide auditions took place from February 2012. The eighth season of &quot;Idols&quot; was shown on M-Net and Mzansi Magic on DStv simultaneously. On 2 October 2012, Khaya Mthethwa from Durban in KwaZulu-Natal was declared the winner, becoming the first black contestant in the show&#x27;s history to win.

=== Season 9 ===

It was announced on 11 January 2013 that the show had been renewed for a ninth season in 2013. Nationwide auditions took place from February 2013. The ninth season of &quot;Idols&quot; was broadcast simultaneously on M-Net and Mzansi Magic on DStv. The season was won by Musa Sukwene and the runner-up was Brenden Ledwaba. This was the first time in South African &quot;Idol&quot; history that the top three contestants were all male.

=== Season 10 ===

Broadcasting of the tenth season of &quot;Idols&quot; commenced on M-Net on 13 July 2014 and the finale was broadcast on M-Net and Mzansi Magic. Vincent Bones&#x27; inspiring life story of being a street kid at the age of 12 after his mother died touched the hearts of many as he emerged as the tenth South African &quot;Idols&quot; winner on 23 November 2014. Runner-up was Bongiwe Silinda, the second black woman in South African Idols history to go as far as the finale.

=== Season 11 ===
The eleventh season of &quot;Idols&quot; South Africa began broadcasting on 12 July 2015. Somizi Mhlongo was added to the judging panel, and the duration of each episode was increased to two hours. Karabo Mogane won the season and Mmatema Moremi was the runner-up.

=== Season 12 ===
The twelfth season began broadcasting in July 2016 and ended on 27 November 2016. The top two were Noma Khumalo and second-timer Thami Shobede, where Noma won. Unfortunately, Thami passed away three years later.

=== Season 13 ===

The thirteenth season began to broadcast on 9 July 2017 and final was on 19 November 2017. The season ended with Paxton Fielies being crowned the winner, while the runner-up was Mthokozisi Ndaba.

=== Season 14 ===

The fourteenth season of &quot;Idols&quot; began to broadcast on 8 July 2018 and finale was held on 18 November 2018, naming the winner 17-year-old Yanga Sobetwa. The runner-up was Thato Makape.

=== Season 15 ===
The fifteenth season premiered on 7 July 2019, 17:30 CAT on the Mzansi Magic television network. On 17 November 2019, just before 19:00 CAT, the show&#x27;s presenter and producer, ProVerb announced that the fifteenth season winner was 24-year-old Luyolo Yiba.

=== Season 16 ===
The sixteenth season of &quot;Idols&quot; started on 2 August 2020 and concluded on 13 December 2020. The season&#x27;s winner was 18-year-old Zama Khumalo, while the runner-up was Mr Music.

=== Season 17 ===
The seventeenth season of &quot;Idols&quot; started on 11 July 2021 and concluded on 21 November 2021. The winner was 31-year-old singer Berenike &quot;Berry&quot; Trytsman, while the runner-up was Karabo Mathe. It was the first time in South African &quot;Idols&quot; history that the top three contestants were all female.

Judge Somizi Mhlongo only appeared in the pre-recorded episodes to deal with personal issues. He was replaced by a guest judge for all the live episodes. This was the last season for resident judges Unathi Nkayi and Randall Abrahams.

===Season 18 ===
The eighteenth season of &quot;Idols&quot; premiered on 17 July 2022 and ended on 13 November 2022 on Mzansi Magic. The season was won by Thapelo Molomo, while Nozi Sibiya was the runner-up.

The Top 16 round was replaced with a Top 12 one. It was the first season without Randall Abrahams as a judge since the inception of the &quot;Idols South Africa&quot; franchise. The seventeenth season was also the last for Unathi Nkayi as judge after it was announced at the end of that season that the two would not be returning. Two new judges replaced them, Thembi Seete and JR.

===Season 19===

The nineteenth and final season of &quot;Idols&quot; premiered on 8 July 2023 and ended on 4 November 2023 on Mzansi Magic and Mzansi Wethu. The season was won by Thabo Ndlovu, while Princess MacDonald was the runner-up.

== Controversy ==
The show has gone through a lot of controversies since its first broadcast.

In the first season, presenter Matthew Stewardson was replaced halfway through the show by Sami Sabiti. Soon after that, Stewardson checked himself into a drug rehabilitation centre.

The outcome of &quot;Idols I&quot; was followed by a row of complaints about Heinz Winckler&#x27;s victory, as many viewers saw the result as injustice and racially biased.

Third season winner Karin Kortje was not so lucky in her personal life as her boyfriend was charged with robbery and murder just months after the show. Unlike other finalists of her season, Kortje was not invited to take part in the final of the following season.

In the final showdown of the fifth season, there were problems with the voteline. This resulted in some of the votes that were sent before the cut-off time not being counted. The investigation hit the front page of &quot;The Times&quot; on 8 May 2009, and later in the day it was announced on the official Idols website that the recount had showed that Jason Hartman had received 200,000 more votes than Sasha-Lee Davids, who was originally declared as the winner in the grand finale, with 52.77% of the votes. Four days later, &quot;Idols&quot; announced that, after discussions between M-Net and FremantleMedia (the format owners), Hartman and Davids were declared joint winners. They both received identical full prizes. This was the first time a win was shared on an Idols show.

In the fifteenth season, top five contestant, Viggy Qwabe, withdrew from the competition shortly after her identical twin-sister, Virginia, failed to advance to the top five round. The twins&#x27; father alleged that the voting process was rigged. Reportedly, police had to be called to the scene backstage to intervene after some of the twins&#x27; family and fans threatened violence. The girls also didn&#x27;t return for the finale as is usually done by the top ten contestants of each season.

The seventeenth season saw judge Somizi Mhlongo being asked to step-aside by the show to deal with domestic abuse allegations against him by his husband Mohale Motaung. As a result, he only appeared in the first few episodes that were pre-recorded by the time the allegations surfaced. There was subsequently a ratings plunge for the show following his departure.

<text>Ashraf Choudhary (born 15 February 1949; Sialkot, Punjab) is a Pakistani-New Zealand scientist in agricultural engineering and formerly a member of the Parliament in New Zealand. He is a member of the Labour Party, and was New Zealand&#x27;s first MP from South Asia and Pakistan.

==Early life==
Choudhary was born in the Pakistani half of the Punjab region in village Jajay at the home of Chaudhry Muhammad Boota. He comes from a family of agriculture. He attended high school in the town of Sialkot, and then gained a degree in agricultural engineering from University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) in Faisalabad. He continued his studies abroad, gaining a master&#x27;s degree in agricultural engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, England and a PhD in agricultural engineering at Massey University, New Zealand.

== Scientific and community work ==
Choudhary was originally an environmental scientist and taught at Massey University. He has published a large number of scientific papers in his field, and is considered to be an international authority on conservation tillage. His work has a particular focus on agricultural techniques in developing countries. Choudhary has three children.

Before entering Parliament, Choudhary had worked with a number of community organisations, including such groups as the New Zealand Federation of Ethnic Councils and FIANZ – the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (of which he was president in 1984–85). In his capacity as president of FIANZ he oversaw the first annual halal meat contract with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board in June 1984, with the aid of Mazhar Krasniqi, Hajji Abdul Rahim Rasheed and Dr. Mohammad Hanif Quazi.

==Parliamentary politics==

Having been a supporter of the Labour Party for some time, Choudhary was elected to Parliament as a Labour Party list MP in the 2002 election. He was sworn in on the Qur&#x27;an, which Winston Peters (leader of the New Zealand First party) criticised as breaking &quot;centuries-old tradition.&quot; Choudhary, however, responded that the tradition was broken when Premier Julius Vogel was sworn in on the Torah. Because Parliamentary officials did not have a copy of the Qur&#x27;an, they obtained a copy from the FIANZ office, which was then donated to the Parliamentary Library for use in the future.

During his time in Parliament, Choudhary served on the Primary Production, Local Government and Environment, and Education and Science select committees. He also came to public attention in 2003, when he abstained in a vote to legalise prostitution. The Muslim community were upset by his decision to abstain from voting since prostitution is seen as a violation of their faith.

In 2011, Choudhary was mentioned in Anders Behring Breivik&#x27;s manifesto &quot;2083: A European Declaration of Independence&quot; where Choudhary was used an example of Muslim&#x27;s failing to assimilate by not condoning the stoning of homosexuals and those who have extramarital affairs. Choudhary had in 2004 stated that stoning was in line with Qur&#x27;an teachings, but had no place in New Zealand. He responded to the inclusion in the manifesto by saying &quot;He is a terrorist and we should condemn what he has done and that is all I really want to say.&quot;

==Post-parliament career==
On 29 September 2011, Choudhary delivered his valedictory speech in Parliament and would retire from politics after the 2011 general election.

<doc id="467035" wikidata="Q411064" url="?curid=467035" title="Androstenedione">
<text>Androstenedione, or 4-androstenedione (abbreviated as A4 or Δ4-dione), also known as androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, is an endogenous weak androgen steroid hormone and intermediate in the biosynthesis of estrone and of testosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). It is closely related to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol).

== Function ==
Androstenedione is a precursor of testosterone and other androgens, as well as of estrogens like estrone, in the body. In addition to functioning as an endogenous prohormone, androstenedione also has weak androgenic activity in its own right.

Androstenedione has been found to possess some estrogenic activity, similarly to other DHEA metabolites. However, in contrast to androstenediol, its affinity for the estrogen receptors is very low, with less than 0.01% of the affinity of estradiol for both the ERα and ERβ.

===Adrenarche===
In children aged 6 to 8 years old, there is a rise in androstenedione secretion along with DHEA during adrenarche. This rise in androstenedione and DHEA is hypothesized to play a crucial role for learning social, cultural and ecological skills, such as the development and understanding of sexual attraction. Furthermore, it is thought that androstenedione plays a role in levels of aggression and competition in boys, as a positive correlation between the two were observed, while testosterone levels were below detection.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
Androstenedione is the common precursor of the androgen and estrogen sex hormones.

Androstenedione can be biosynthesized in one of two ways. The primary pathway involves conversion of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA by way of 17,20-lyase, with subsequent conversion of DHEA to androstenedione via the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The secondary pathway involves conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, most often a precursor to cortisol, to androstenedione directly by way of 17,20-lyase. Thus, 17,20-lyase is required for the synthesis of androstenedione, whether immediately or one step removed.

Androstenedione is produced in the adrenal glands and the gonads. The production of adrenal androstenedione is governed by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), whereas production of gonadal androstenedione is under control by the gonadotropins. In premenopausal women, the adrenal glands and ovaries each produce about half of the total androstenedione (about 3 mg/day). After menopause, androstenedione production is about halved, due primarily to the reduction of the steroid secreted by the ovary. Nevertheless, androstenedione is the principal steroid produced by the postmenopausal ovary.

Some androstenedione is also secreted into the plasma, and may be converted in peripheral tissues to testosterone and estrogens.

===Metabolism===
Androstenedione is converted to either testosterone or estrone. Conversion of androstenedione to testosterone requires the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Androstenedione is released into the blood by theca cells. Conversion of androstenedione to estrone requires the enzyme aromatase. Androstenedione is a substrate for estrogen production in granulosa cells which produce aromatase. Thus, theca cells and granulosa cells work together to form estrogens.

Androstanedione is a 5α-reduced metabolite of 4-androstenedione which serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and neurosteroid androsterone.

Androstenedione also has a variety of metabolites in different species. In cattle, androstenedione is converted into oestradiol-17 and epitestosterone. In sheep, the molecule is transformed into the 17-epimer. Androstenedione is converted into different metabolites in invertebrates. As is the case for &quot;Marisa cornuarietis,&quot; freshwater ramshorn snail, where androstenedione is converted into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T) in male and into 5α-dihydroandrostenedione (DHA) in females.

===Levels===
Levels are normally 30–200 ng/dL (1.0–7.0 nmol/L) in females and 40–150 ng/dL (1.4–5.2 nmol/L) in males. 

In premature infants, serum androstenedione levels hover between 80 and 446 ng/dL. In full-term newborns, levels range from 20 to 290 ng/dL, and between 1 month and 1 year old, serum levels typically stay at less than 69 ng/dL.

Serum levels of androstenedione greater than or equal to 500 ng/dL may indicate the presence of an adrenal or gonadal tumor.

==Pharmacology==
Androstenedione has been shown to increase serum testosterone levels over an eight-hour period in men when taken as a single oral dose of 300 mg per day, but a dose of 100 mg had no significant effect on serum testosterone. However, serum levels of estradiol increased following both the 100 mg and 300 mg doses. The study also reported that the serum level of estrogens and testosterone produced varied widely between individuals.

A 2006 review paper summarized several studies that examined the effect of androstenedione on strength training. At dosages of 50 mg or 100 mg per day, androstenedione had no effect on muscle strength or size, or on body fat levels. One study used a daily dosage of 300 mg of androstenedione combined with several other supplements, and also found no increase in strength when compared to a control group that did not take the supplements.

The review authors speculate that sufficiently high doses may indeed lead to increased muscle size and strength. However, due to the federal ban on androstenedione supplements, it is difficult to carry out new research on its effects. The review authors conclude that individuals should not use androstenedione supplements due to the lack of evidence of beneficial effects, the wide variation in individual responses to the supplement, and the risk of unknown side effects. Side effects for women may include the development of male characteristics, clitoromegaly, voice deepening, hirsutism, abnormal menstrual cycles and abnormal bleeding, blood clots, and metabolic disruption based on a study following 10 healthy females administering 100 mg androstenedione.

==Medical use==
Under the brand name Metharmon-F and in combination with sex steroids (pregnenolone, testosterone, estrone, androstenediol) and thyroid hormone (desiccated thyroid), androstenedione is or has been marketed for medical use in Thailand.

==Chemistry==
Androstenedione, also known as androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (A5; androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one), as well as to 5α-androstanedione (5α-androstane-3,17-dione) and estrone (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol-17-one or 19-norandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol-17-one).

==History==

===Use as a supplement===
Androstenedione was manufactured as a dietary supplement, often called &quot;andro&quot; or &quot;andros&quot; for short. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; credits Patrick Arnold with introducing androstenedione to the North American market. Androstenedione supplements are credited with increasing testosterone levels, enhancing athletic performance, building body muscles, reducing fats, increasing energy, maintaining healthy RBCs, and increasing sexual performance. Although, all of these effects have not been proven through scientific study. Androstenedione was legal and able to be purchased over the counter, and, as a consequence, it was in common use in Major League Baseball throughout the 1990s by record-breaking sluggers like Mark McGwire.

Barry R. McCaffrey, in his capacity as director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 1996 to 2001, determined that androstenedione could not be classified as an anabolic steroid because there is no proof that it promotes muscle growth.

==Society and culture==
===Regulation===
Androstenedione is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and from the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee in 1997 banned androstenedione and placed it under the category of androgenic-anabolic steroids. Androstenedione is banned by MLB, the NFL, USOC, NCAA, and by the NBA.

On March 12, 2004, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 was introduced into the United States Senate. It amended the Controlled Substance Act to place both anabolic steroids and prohormones on a list of controlled substances, making possession of the banned substances a federal crime. The law took effect on January 20, 2005. However, androstenedione was legally defined as an anabolic steroid, even though there is scant evidence that androstenedione itself is anabolic in nature. On April 11, 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of androstenedione, citing that the drug poses significant health risks commonly associated with steroids. Androstenedione is currently banned by the U.S. military.

<text>Al Anbar Governorate (; &quot;muḥāfaẓat al-’Anbār&quot;), or Anbar Province, is the largest governorate in Iraq by area. Encompassing much of the country&#x27;s western territory, it shares borders with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The population is mostly Sunni Arabs. The provincial capital is Ramadi; other important cities include Fallujah, Al-Qa&#x27;im and Haditha.

The governorate was known as Ramadi up to 1976 when it was renamed Al Anbar Province, and it was known as &quot;Dulaim&quot; before 1962. A large majority of the inhabitants of the province are Arab Sunni Muslims and most belong to the Dulaim tribe.

In early 2014, the Islamic State, with the assistance of some local Sunni militias, launched a successful campaign to seize control of the province from the Iraqi government. Numerous offensive actions were undertaken by the Iraqi government, with the assistance of local Sunni tribes to remove IS&#x27;s occupation of the province, especially in the Anbar campaign (2015–16), the Western Anbar offensive (September 2017) and the 2017 Western Iraq campaign. The area was effectively recaptured by the end of 2017 and has been at peace since then.

==Etymology==
The name of the governorate in Persian language means &quot;warehouse&quot; or &quot;silo&quot;. This was the last stop/warehouses on the old Silk Road toward Syria. The name is pre-Islamic. The name of the governorate is taken over from a historic city that was originally located on its territory and whose ruins can still be seen 5 km northwest of Fallujah near the city of Saqlawiyah today. This city of Anbār or Peroz-Shapur was founded in the 3rd century by the Muntherids and was, before the Arab conquest in 634, the second-largest city of Iraq. It was abandoned after the Mongol invasion in the 14th century. A pseudo-authentication is offered by proposing that the name is Arabic and stands for &quot;granaries&quot; in Arabic, further proposing the word Anbar (أنبار) to be the plural of Nbr (نبر) which meaning &quot;grains&quot;. The name was already in use in Pre-Islamic times during the Sasanian rule over Iraq, long before Arabic replaced Aramaic as the main language of Iraq.

Dulaim is the old name of the governorate due to the Dulaim tribe inhabiting the region. It was also called Liwa Al-Dulaim () in the Ottoman period and Sanjak Al-Dulaim in the seventeenth century.

== History ==

=== Al Dulaim Tribe ===
Al Anbar was known as the Dulaim Province to the concentration of Dulaim Tribe in this region and before them, it was informally named as Sanjak Al Dulaim. During the Ottoman period, the province of Dulaim was created, today known as Al Anbar Governorate. In 1706, Sheikh Itha bin Hamad was appointed as its ruler. But it came into its current form in the 1930s when Iraq was a monarchy.

King Faisal I of Iraq visited the province on July 31, 1921. He was received by Sheikh Ali Al Sulaimani, the ruler of the province, and 6,000 members of the tribe.

=== Caliphate period ===

During the reign of Rashidun Caliph Abu bakr the conquest of Anbar was launched his successors conquered whole Middle East. 

During the Abbasid era in the reign of Caliph Abu al-Abbas Abdallah al-Saffah in 751, the second capital of the Abbasid Caliphate after Kufa to Baghdad where he built his palace in 762. He built the road through the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, so the armies entering and leaving Iraq are passing through this region.

== Geography ==
Anbar is one of the driest governorates in Iraq&#x27;s western desert climate. Some of Al Anbar is part of the Syrian Desert, characterized by steppe and desert terrain. Most of Al Anbar is considered as a topographical continuation of the Arabian Peninsula plateau region. It has some small hills and a number of wadis, including Wadi Hauran. Given a decline in land preservation and a lack of natural vegetation, the land is often exposed to the elements and prone to severe erosion.

Among the most important agricultural crops are potatoes, which are harvested in spring and fall. Wheat, barley and maize (corn) are also commonly grown in the governorate. Al Anbar is also known for the production of phosphates and fertilizer. It is also rich in mineral such as sulphur, gold and oil. However, Anbar has not been extensively explored for oil.
=== Climate ===
The average rainfall in Al Anbar is 115 millimeters (4.53 in) per year. Summer temperatures may reach as high as 52°C (125°F) and may fall as low as 0°C (32°F) in the winter. The Euphrates River is the main water source for residents of the governorate. The river flows southeasterly through seven of Al Anbar&#x27;s districts:
* Al-Qa&#x27;im District
* Anah District
* Haditha District
* Hit District
* Rawah District
* Ramadi District
* Fallujah District
* Ar-Rutba District

==Government==
* Governor: Sheikh Mohammed Ali Wilber Al-Dulaimi
* Deputy Governor: Ibrahim Al Asal
* Technical Governor&#x27;s councilor : Engineer Adil Bardan
* Provincial Council Chairman (PCC): Ahmed Hamid al-Alwani

==Demographics==
In the 1920s, the governorate had a population of 250,000, as did Baghdad, out of a total population of 2 million in Iraq. Today there are 9 million people living in Baghdad, among them a million Anbari people in the city and suburbs; their origins are the people of the Al-Anbar tribes that have moved to Baghdad during the past 500 years and their recent migrations there during the 1920s and 1930s.

Half of the residents in Anbar are living on the banks of the Euphrates River outside cities and the towns, there were between 1.9 million and 2 million inhabitants in the districts of Al Anbar. The largest cities are Ramadi (pop. 900,000) and Fallujah (700,000).
According to UN estimate in 2003 the population of Al Anbar is 1,230,169. There are no precise estimates of the population which include all of the cities and towns and villages in Anbar. According to a 2003 estimate by the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq, the population was 1,230,140.

It is estimated that around 90 percent of Anbar&#x27;s inhabitants are adherents of the Sunni branch of Islam. The remaining ten percent are either Shias or other minorities.

==Anbar during U.S. occupation==
The geographic challenge of the Anbar Governorate is demonstrated by two contrasting facts: while it is Iraq&#x27;s largest governorate, it also is the most sparsely populated. For a governorate that is approximately the size of Bangladesh, it is home to fewer than 1.8 million Iraqis. Most of the population lives in the major cities, like Ramadi and Fallujah, and almost everyone else lives within a short distance of the Euphrates River that snakes from Baghdad to the Syrian border near Al-Qa&#x27;im. Its strategic challenge was demonstrated, in part, by casualty statistics. During the first four years of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the Anbar Province was the deadliest province for American service members, claiming approximately one-third of American fatalities.

The Anbar Province was the Sunni stronghold that had long provided Saddam Hussein with the support he needed to remain in power. During the early years of Operation Iraqi Freedom, it provided an important base for Al Qaeda and insurgent operations. Part of its significance came from the fact that the Western Euphrates River Valley served as an important infiltration route for foreign fighters headed to Iraq&#x27;s heartland. &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared this region to the Vietnam War&#x27;s Ho Chi Minh Trail, as foreign fighters and insurgents used the river valley to move in relative safety from the Syrian border to cities like Baghdad, Ramadi and Fallujah.

The contrast between the fertile Euphrates River Valley and the rest of the province is striking. Along the Euphrates, groves of fruits and vegetables and acre after acre of date palms are surrounded by a lushness that paints the area a vivid green. Just a few miles from the Euphrates, however, the barren landscape turns brown. With the exception of an occasional Bedouin, the desert is essentially empty. Whether traveling by aircraft, vehicle, or on foot, the Anbar Governorate is vast. During a time when mining roads became a strategy of choice for insurgents, the need to patrol and travel throughout the province became one of the Marine Corps&#x27; greatest challenges. The threat of insurgent activity, when combined with the challenges that long-distance travel, choking dust, and stifling heat created, made the Anbar Province a difficult area of operation.

<text>Light truckorlight-duty truck is a US classification for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight up to and a payload capacity up to . Similar goods vehicle classes in the European Union, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are termed light commercial vehicles and are limited to a gross vehicle weight of up to .

== United States ==
Federal regulations define a light-duty truck to be any motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating (curb weight plus payload) of no more than which is “(1) Designed primarily for purposes of transportation of property or is a derivation of such a vehicle, or (2) Designed primarily for transportation of persons and has a capacity of more than 12 persons, or (3) Available with special features enabling off-street or off-highway operation and use.”
Light trucks includes vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles. Vehicles in this category are far more likely to kill or injure pedestrians than smaller passenger cars.


=== Incentive to increase size ===

Under federal regulations, crafted with heavy lobbying input, cars must meet tougher emissions and mileage rules than light trucks. Vehicles that have larger “footprints,” measured as the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground, are allowed less stringent emissions standards. A less than 1 square meter increase in the footprint of a vehicle allows for 2% to 3% more carbon dioxide emissions.

=== Fuel efficiency ===

The United States government uses light truck as a vehicle class in regulating fuel economy through the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard. 
The class includes vans, minivans, sport utility vehicles, and pickups.
Light trucks have lower fuel economy standards than cars, under the premise that these vehicles are used for utilitarian purposes rather than personal transportation. Because of their body-on-frame construction method, they are heavier than a unibody vehicle of the same size.

=== Tariffs ===
Light truck manufacturing in the United States is protected by the Chicken Tax, a 25% tariff on imported light trucks.

<doc id="467047" wikidata="Q209233" url="?curid=467047" title="Thermal energy">
<text>The term &quot;thermal energy&quot; is often used ambiguously in physics and engineering. It can denote several different physical concepts, including:

* Internal energy: The energy contained within a body of matter or radiation, excluding the potential energy of the whole system, and excluding the kinetic energy of the system moving as a whole.
* Heat: Energy in transfer between a system and its surroundings by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work and transfer of matter.
* The characteristic energy  associated with a single microscopic degree of freedom, where denotes temperature and denotes the Boltzmann constant.

Mark Zemansky (1970) has argued that the term “thermal energy” is best avoided due to its ambiguity. He suggests using more precise terms such as “internal energy” and “heat” to avoid confusion. The term is, however, used in some textbooks.

== Relation between heat and internal energy ==
In thermodynamics, heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter, such as conduction, radiation, and friction. Heat refers to a quantity in transfer between systems, not to a property of any one system, or &quot;contained&quot; within it; on the other hand, internal energy and enthalpy are properties of a single system. Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurs. In contrast, internal energy is a property of the state of a system and can thus be understood without knowing how the energy got there.

==Macroscopic thermal energy==

In addition to the microscopic kinetic energies of its molecules, the internal energy of a body includes chemical energy belonging to distinct molecules, and the global joint potential energy involved in the interactions between molecules and suchlike. Thermal energy may be viewed as contributing to internal energy or to enthalpy.

===Chemical internal energy===

The internal energy of a body can change in a process in which chemical potential energy is converted into non-chemical energy. In such a process, the thermodynamic system can change its internal energy by doing work on its surroundings, or by gaining or losing energy as heat. It is not quite lucid to merely say that &quot;the converted chemical potential energy has simply become internal energy&quot;. It is, however, sometimes convenient to say that &quot;the chemical potential energy has been converted into thermal energy&quot;. This is expressed in ordinary traditional language by talking of &#x27;heat of reaction&#x27;.

===Potential energy of internal interactions===

In a body of material, especially in condensed matter, such as a liquid or a solid, in which the constituent particles, such as molecules or ions, interact strongly with one another, the energies of such interactions contribute strongly to the internal energy of the body. Still, they are not immediately apparent in the kinetic energies of molecules, as manifest in temperature. Such energies of interaction may be thought of as contributions to the global internal microscopic potential energies of the body.

==Microscopic thermal energy==

In a statistical mechanical account of an ideal gas, in which the molecules move independently between instantaneous collisions, the internal energy is just the sum total of the gas&#x27;s independent particles&#x27; kinetic energies, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system&#x27;s boundary. For a gas that does not have particle interactions except for instantaneous collisions, the term &quot;thermal energy&quot; is effectively synonymous with &quot;internal energy&quot;.

In many statistical physics texts, &quot;thermal energy&quot; refers to formula_1, the product of the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, also written as formula_2.

==Thermal current density==

When there is no accompanying flow of matter, the term &quot;thermal energy&quot; is also applied to the energy carried by a heat flow.

<text>Triiodothyronine, also known as T3, is a thyroid hormone. It affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate.

Production of T3 and its prohormone thyroxine (T4) is activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is released from the anterior pituitary gland. This pathway is part of a closed-loop feedback process: Elevated concentrations of T3, and T4 in the blood plasma inhibit the production of TSH in the anterior pituitary gland. As concentrations of these hormones decrease, the anterior pituitary gland increases production of TSH, and by these processes, a feedback control system stabilizes the level of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream.

At the cellular level, T3 is the body&#x27;s more active and potent thyroid hormone. T3 helps deliver oxygen and energy to all of the body&#x27;s cells, its effects on target tissues being roughly four times more potent than those of T4. Of the thyroid hormone that is produced, just about 20% is T3, whereas 80% is produced as T4. Roughly 85% of the circulating T3 is later formed in the liver and anterior pituitary by removal of the iodine atom from the carbon atom number five of the outer ring of T4. In any case, the concentration of T3 in the human blood plasma is about one-fortieth that of T4. The half-life of T3 is about 2.5days. The half-life of T4 is about 6.5days. T3 levels start to rise 45minutes after administration and peak at about 2.5hours. Although manufacturer of Cytomel states half-life to be 2.5days the half-life variability is great and can vary depending on the thyroid status of the patient. Newer studies have found the pharmakokinetics of T3 to be complex and the half-life to vary between 22hours.

== Production ==

=== Synthesis from T4 ===
T3 is the more metabolically active hormone produced from T4. T4 is deiodinated by three deiodinase enzymes to produce the more-active triiodothyronine:
# Type I present in liver, kidney, thyroid, and (to a lesser extent) pituitary; it accounts for 80% of the deiodination of T4.
# Type II present in CNS, pituitary, brown adipose tissue, and heart vessel, which is predominantly intracellular. In the pituitary, it mediates negative feedback on thyroid-stimulating hormone.
# Type III present in placenta, CNS, and hemangioma. This deiodinase converts T4 into reverse T3, which, unlike T3, is inactive.

T4 is synthesised in the thyroid follicular cells as follows.
# The sodium-iodide symporter transports two sodium ions across the basement membrane of the follicular cells along with an iodine ion. This is a secondary active transporter that utilises the concentration gradient of Na+ to move I− against its concentration gradient.
# I− is moved across the apical membrane into the colloid of the follicle.
# Thyroperoxidase oxidises I− to form the I radical.
# The thyroperoxidase iodinates the tyrosyl residues of the thyroglobulin within the colloid. The thyroglobulin was synthesised in the ER of the follicular cell and secreted into the colloid.
# Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) released from the anterior pituitary gland binds the TSH receptor (a Gs protein-coupled receptor) on the basolateral membrane of the cell and stimulates the endocytosis of the colloid.
# The endocytosed vesicles fuse with the lysosomes of the follicular cell. The lysosomal enzymes cleave the T4 from the iodinated thyroglobulin.
# These vesicles are then exocytosed, releasing the thyroid hormones.

=== Direct synthesis ===
The thyroid gland also produces small amounts of T3 directly. In the follicular lumen, tyrosine residues become iodinated. This reaction requires hydrogen peroxide. Iodine bonds carbon 3 or carbon 5 of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin in a process called organification of iodine. The iodination of specific tyrosines yields monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). One MIT and one DIT are enzymatically coupled to form T3. The enzyme is thyroid peroxidase.

The small amount of T3 could be important because different tissues have different sensitivities to T4 due to differences in deiodinase ubiquitination in different tissues. This once again raises the question if T3 should be included in thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT).

== Mechanism of action ==
T3 and T4 bind to nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptors). T3 and T4, although being lipophilic, are not able to passively diffuse through the phospholipid bilayers of target cells, instead relying on transmembrane iodothyronine transporters. The lipophilicity of T3 and T4 requires their binding to the protein carrier thyroid-binding protein (TBG) (thyroxine-binding globulins, thyroxine binding prealbumins, and albumins) for transport in the blood. The thyroid receptors bind to response elements in gene promoters, thus enabling them to activate or inhibit transcription. The sensitivity of a tissue to T3 is modulated through the thyroid receptors.

== Transportation ==
T3 and T4 are carried in the blood, bound to plasma proteins. This has the effect of increasing the half-life of the hormone and decreasing the rate at which it is taken up by peripheral tissues. There are three main proteins that the two hormones are bound to. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a glycoprotein that has a higher affinity for T4 than for T3. Transthyretin is also a glycoprotein, but only carries T4, with hardly any affinity at all for T3. Finally, both hormones bind with a low affinity to serum albumin, but, due to the large availability of albumin, it has a high capacity.

The saturation of binding spots on &quot;thyronine-binding globulin&quot; (TBG) by endogenous T3 can be estimated by the &quot;triiodothyronine resin uptake test&quot;. The test is performed by taking a blood sample, to which an excess of radioactive exogenous T3 is added, followed by a resin that also binds T3. A fraction of the radioactive T3 binds to sites on TBG not already occupied by endogenous thyroid hormone, and the remainder binds to the resin. The amount of labeled hormones bound to the resin is then subtracted from the total that was added, with the remainder thus being the amount that was bound to the unoccupied binding sites on TBG.

== Effects ==
T3 increases the basal metabolic rate and, thus, increases the body&#x27;s oxygen and energy consumption. The basal metabolic rate is the minimal caloric requirement needed to sustain life in a resting individual. T3 acts on the majority of tissues within the body, with a few exceptions including the spleen. It increases the synthesis and activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase (which normally constitutes a substantial fraction of total cellular ATP expenditure) without disrupting transmembrane ion balance. In general, it increases the turnover of different endogenous macromolecules by increasing their synthesis and degradation.

=== Skeletal growth ===
Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and skeletal maturation. They potentiate the effect of growth hormone and somatomedins to promote bone growth, epiphysial closure and bone maturation.

===Protein===
T3 stimulates the production of RNA polymerase I and II and, therefore, increases the rate of protein synthesis. It also increases the rate of protein degradation, and, in excess, the rate of protein degradation exceeds the rate of protein synthesis. In such situations, the body may go into negative ion balance.

===Lipids===
T3 stimulates the breakdown of cholesterol and increases the number of LDL receptors, thereby increasing the rate of lipolysis.

===Heart===
T3 increases the heart rate and force of contraction, thus increasing cardiac output, by increasing β-adrenergic receptor levels in myocardium. This results in increased systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood pressure. The latter two effects act to produce the typical bounding pulse seen in hyperthyroidism. It also upregulates the thick filament protein myosin, which helps to increase contractility. A helpful clinical measure to assess contractility is the time between the QRS complex and the second heart sound. This is often decreased in hyperthyroidism.

===Development===
T3 has profound effect upon the developing embryo and infants. It affects the lungs and influences the postnatal growth of the central nervous system. It stimulates the production of myelin, the production of neurotransmitters, and the growth of axons. It is also important in the linear growth of bones.

===Neurotransmitters===
T3 may increase serotonin in the brain, in particular in the cerebral cortex, and down-regulate 5HT-2 receptors, based on studies in which T3 reversed learned helplessness in rats and physiological studies of the rat brain.

==Physiological function==
Thyroid hormones act to increase protein turnover. This might serve an adaptive function in regard to long-term calorie restriction with adequate protein. When calories are in short supply, reduction in protein turnover may ameliorate the effects of the shortage.

==Measurement==

Triiodothyronine can be measured as &quot;free triiodothyronine&quot;, which is an indicator of triiodothyronine activity in the body. It can also be measured as &quot;total triiodothyronine&quot;, which also depends on the triiodothyronine that is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin.

==Medical Uses==
=== Treatment of depressive disorders ===
The addition of triiodothyronine to existing treatments such as SSRIs is one of the most widely studied augmentation strategies for refractory depression, however success may depend on the dosage of T3. A long-term case series study by Kelly and Lieberman of 17 patients with major refractory unipolar depression found that 14 patients showed sustained improvement of symptoms over an average timespan of two years, in some cases with higher doses of T3 than the traditional 50 μg required to achieve therapeutic effect, with an average of 80 μg and a dosage span of 24 months; dose range: 25–150 μg. The same authors published a retrospective study of 125 patients with the two most common categories of bipolar disorders II and NOS whose treatment had previously been resistant to an average of 14 other medications. They found that 84% experienced improvement and 33% experienced full remission over a period of an average of 20.3 months (standard deviation of 9.7). None of the patients experienced hypomania while on T3.

=== Use as a fat loss supplement ===
3,5-Diiodo--thyronine and 3,3′-diiodo--thyronine are used as ingredients in certain over-the-counter fat-loss supplements, designed for bodybuilding. Several studies have shown that these compounds increase the metabolization of fatty acids and the burning of adipose fat tissue in rats.

== Alternative medicine ==
Triiodothyronine has been used to treat Wilson&#x27;s syndrome, an alternative medical diagnosis not recognized as a medical condition by mainstream medicine. This diagnosis involves various non-specific symptoms that are attributed to the thyroid, despite normal thyroid function tests. The American Thyroid Association has raised concern that the prescribed treatment with triiodothyronine is potentially harmful.

== History ==
In 1950 Dr Jack Gross, a Canadian endocrinologist, came to the British National Institute for Medical Research to work with Rosalind Pitt-Rivers as a postdoctoral fellow. Gross had previous experience working at McGill University under Professor Charles Leblond, where they used radioactive iodine to study the physiology of thyroid hormone and applied chromatography to analyze radioiodinated proteins in human blood after radioiodine therapy. Gross and Leblond found an unknown radioactive compound in the blood of rats given radioactive iodine. The compound migrated close to thyroxine in chromatography and they initially named it &#x27;unknown 1&#x27; . Around that time a group led by Jean Roche in Paris described a deiodinating activity in the sheep thyroid gland, raising the possibility that &#x27;unknown 1&#x27; is the less iodinated analogue of T4, triiodothyronine. In march of 1952 Gross &amp; Pitt-Rivers published a paper in &quot;The Lancet&quot; titled &quot;The identification of 3: 5: 3&#x27;-L-triiodothyronine in human plasma&quot;.

While Gross &amp; Pitt-Rivers are normally credited with discovering T3, this compound was actually first isolated by the biochemists Hird &amp; Trikojus at the University of Melbourne in 1948. It has been suggested that their published paper was little-known and therefore easily ignored. It has also been stated that Pitt-Rivers had read this paper but failed to mention it.

<text>Epinions.com was a general consumer review site established in 1999. Epinions was acquired in 2003 by DealTime, later Shopping.com, which was acquired by eBay in 2005. Epinions users could access paid product reviews; the company sold advertising on its site and shared the revenue with authors as an incentive for quality content. Competition from sites that crowdsourced reviews for free led to years of financial decline. On 25 March 2014, all community features, and features for submitting and editing reviews, were disabled. Subsequently, in May 2018, the site was fully closed down, and URLs in the epinions.com domain redirect to Shopping.com.

==Corporate history==
Epinions was founded in 1999, during the dot-com bubble, by Nirav Tolia (who left Yahoo and $10M of unvested shares), Naval Ravikant (formerly of @Home where he left $4M in options), Ramanathan Guha (from Netscape by way of AOL where he left ~$4M in stock options), Mike Speiser (formerly of McKinsey), and Dion Lim (formerly of Morgan Stanley) with $8 million in seed financing from venture capitalists Benchmark Capital and August Capital.

By January 2003 it had 5.8 million users, but all of the founders other than Tolia had left, and the company had just started to make a profit in 2002. In the words of Tolia: &quot;We felt we couldn&#x27;t finish what we started because we had a little problem. We needed a viable business model.&quot;

In 2003, the company Dealtime acquired Epinions for an undisclosed amount of stock and Tolia became the COO of the new company, Shopping.com. The four co-founders who had left consented to the deal, which rendered their shares worthless. Shopping.com had an initial public offering on October 30, 2004. At the end of trading that day, Shopping.com was worth $750 million; the two VC firms&#x27; shares were worth ~$60M, and Tolia&#x27;s shares were worth ~$20M.

In January 2005, the four co-founders who had left and other Epinions employee-stockholders filed a lawsuit against Tolia and the two VC firms that provided seed funding. The suit claimed that the defendants &quot;failed to share with them &#x27;material facts concerning Epinions&#x27; financial affairs,&#x27; including news of a deal with Google that the company knew would increase its 2003 profit by 1,400 percent&quot;. The case was settled by December 2005; financial terms were not disclosed.

In June 2005 eBay and Shopping.com announced that eBay would acquire Shopping.com for $634M and the transaction was completed in August of that year.

The company started relatively early in the history of crowdsourcing online content, before it was clear which business models would be successful. Competitors found that consumers were willing to provide product reviews for free, and that especially with a large volume, these were of adequate quality. This undercut Epinion&#x27;s costs and resulted in years of financial decline. Over time, unpaid crowdsourced reviews became common on e-commerce sites, especially marketplaces like eBay and Amazon.com. These sites earn revenue from the reviews indirectly, when consumers buy items from the marketplace after using the reviews to reduce uncertainty about the quality or appropriateness of products or the trustworthiness of sellers.

Epinions also faced competition from niche sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, and people sharing opinions for free on social media sites that did not exist when the company started.

On February 25, 2014 the company announced that as of March 25, 2014, all Epinions community features and member login would be removed and/or disabled from the Epinions website. The staff at Epinions made it clear the community members would no longer be able to delete or edit their content submissions, and that their submissions would remain on Epinions and the eBay networks without future compensation.

No new product reviews appeared on the site after March 2014; the site was shut down and redirected to shopping.com in May 2018.

==Mechanisms==

Authors were paid for reviews on a vast catalog of items, but other site users determined how visible any given review was.

Epinions.com&#x27;s reputation system was not abuse-proof, but the company maintained a customer care unit in the event a dispute did arise.

Early in 2000, the San Francisco Chronicle interviewed co-founder Mike Speiser and early member Brian Koller, with Speiser claiming the system prevents advertorials from getting exposure, but Koller saying: &quot;There is a lot of &#x27;You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours,&#x27; and mutual admiration societies. You recommend me and mine, I’ll do the same for you.&quot;

The site was also recognized in 2007 by the &quot;Internet for Beginners&quot; writer for About.com as one of the web&#x27;s 10 most valuable web sites. Calling the site &quot;wonderful&quot;, &quot;Internet for Beginners&quot; Editor Paul Gil wrote, &quot;This is a truly valuable resource for the smart consumer.&quot;. The praise was echoed by a CBS television affiliate in California that named Epinions its &quot;Site of the Day&quot;

<doc id="467058" wikidata="Q315860" url="?curid=467058" title="Calcitonin">
<text>Calcitonin is a 32 amino acid peptide hormone secreted by parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid (or endostyle) in humans and other chordates in the ultimopharyngeal body. It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals, as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis. It belongs to the calcitonin-like protein family.

Historically calcitonin has also been called thyrocalcitonin.

==Biosynthesis and regulation==
Calcitonin is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of a larger prepropeptide, which is the product of the CALC1 gene (). It is functionally an antagonist with PTH and Vitamin D3. The CALC1 gene belongs to a superfamily of related protein hormone precursors including islet amyloid precursor protein, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and the precursor of adrenomedullin.

Secretion of calcitonin is stimulated by:
:* an increase in serum Calcium [Ca2+]
:* gastrin and pentagastrin.

==Function==

The hormone participates in calcium (Ca2+) metabolism. In many ways, calcitonin counteracts parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D.

More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca2+ levels in two ways:

:* Major effect: Inhibits osteoclast activity in bones, which break down the bone
:* Minor effect: Inhibits renal tubular cell reabsorption of Ca2+ and phosphate, allowing them to be excreted in the urine

High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate via the renal tubules. leading to marked hypocalcemia. However, this is a minor effect with no physiological significance in humans. It is also a short-lived effect because the kidneys become resistant to calcitonin, as demonstrated by the kidney&#x27;s unaffected excretion of calcium in patients with thyroid tumors that secrete excessive calcitonin.

In its skeleton-preserving actions, calcitonin protects against calcium loss from the skeleton during periods of calcium mobilization, such as pregnancy and, especially, lactation. The protective mechanisms include the direct inhibition of bone resorption and the indirect effect through the inhibition of the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. The reason provided is that prolactin induces the release of PTH related peptide which enhances bone resorption, but is still under investigation.

Other effects are in preventing postprandial hypercalcemia resulting from absorption of Ca2+. Also, calcitonin inhibits food intake in rats and monkeys, and may have CNS action involving the regulation of feeding and appetite.

Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus mainly through its inhibition of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts do not have calcitonin receptors and are therefore not directly affected by calcitonin levels. However, since bone resorption and bone formation are coupled processes, eventually calcitonin&#x27;s inhibition of osteoclastic activity leads to increased osteoblastic activity (as an indirect effect).

==Receptor==

The calcitonin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor localized to osteoclasts as well kidney and brain cells. It is coupled to a Gsα subunit, thus stimulating cAMP production by adenylate cyclase in target cells. It may also affect the ovaries in women and the testes in men.

== Discovery ==
Calcitonin was first purified in 1962 by Douglas Harold Copp and B. Cheney at the University of British Columbia, Canada. It was initially thought to be secreted by the parathyroid gland but was shown by Iain Macintyre and his team at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, to be secreted by parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Dr. Copp named the discovered hormone calcitonin because of its role in &#x27;maintaining normal calcium tone&#x27;.

== Clinical significance ==
Calcitonin assay is used in identifying patients with nodular thyroid diseases. It is helpful in making an early diagnosis of medullary carcinoma of thyroid. A malignancy of the parafollicular cells, i.e. medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), typically produces an elevated serum calcitonin level. Prognosis of MTC depends on early detection and treatment.

Calcitonin also has significantly impacted molecular biology, as the gene encoding calcitonin was the first gene discovered in mammalian cells to be alternatively spliced, now known to be a ubiquitous mechanism in eukaryotes.

==Pharmacology==
Calcitonin has clinically been used for metabolic bone disorders for more than 50 years. Salmon calcitonin is used for the treatment of:
* Postmenopausal osteoporosis
* Hypercalcaemia
* Bone metastases
* Paget&#x27;s disease
* Phantom limb pain

It has been investigated as a possible non-operative treatment for spinal stenosis.

The following information is from the UK Electronic Medicines Compendium

===General characteristics of the active substance===
Salmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. Peak plasma concentrations are attained within the first hour of administration.

Animal studies have shown that calcitonin is primarily metabolised via proteolysis in the kidney following parenteral administration. The metabolites lack the specific biological activity of calcitonin. Bioavailability following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection in humans is high and similar for the two routes of administration (71% and 66%, respectively).

Calcitonin has short absorption and elimination half-lives of 10–15 minutes and 50–80 minutes, respectively. Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusively degraded in the kidneys, forming pharmacologically inactive fragments of the molecule. Therefore, the metabolic clearance is much lower in patients with end-stage kidney failure than in healthy subjects. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is not known. Plasma protein binding is 30% to 40%.

===Characteristics in patients===
There is a relationship between the subcutaneous dose of calcitonin and peak plasma concentrations. Following parenteral administration of 100 IU calcitonin, peak plasma concentration lies between about 200 and 400 pg/ml. Higher blood levels may be associated with increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and secretory diarrhea.

===Preclinical safety data===
Conventional long-term toxicity, reproduction, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity studies have been performed in laboratory animals. Salmon calcitonin is devoid of embryotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic potential.

An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas has been reported in rats given synthetic salmon calcitonin for 1 year. This is considered a species-specific effect and of no clinical relevance. Salmon calcitonin does not cross the placental barrier.

In lactating animals given calcitonin, suppression of milk production has been observed. Calcitonin is secreted into the milk.

==Pharmaceutical manufacture==
Calcitonin was extracted from the ultimobranchial glands (thyroid-like glands) of fish, particularly salmon. Salmon calcitonin resembles human calcitonin, but is more active. At present, it is produced either by recombinant DNA technology or by chemical peptide synthesis. The pharmacological properties of the synthetic and recombinant peptides have been demonstrated to be qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent.

==Uses of calcitonin==

===Treatments===
Calcitonin can be used therapeutically for the treatment of hypercalcemia or osteoporosis.
In a recent clinical study, subcutaneous injections of calcitonin have reduced the incidence of fractures and reduced the decrease in bone mass in women with type 2 diabetes complicated with osteoporosis.

Subcutaneous injections of calcitonin in patients with mania resulted in significant decreases in irritability, euphoria and hyperactivity and hence calcitonin holds promise for treating bipolar disorder. However no further work on this potential application of calcitonin has been reported.

===Diagnostics===

It may be used diagnostically as a tumor marker for medullary thyroid cancer, in which high calcitonin levels may be present and elevated levels after surgery may indicate recurrence. It may even be used on biopsy samples from suspicious lesions (e.g., lymph nodes that are swollen) to establish whether they are metastases of the original cancer.

Cutoffs for calcitonin to distinguish cases with medullary thyroid cancer have been suggested to be as follows, with a higher value increasing the suspicion of medullary thyroid cancer:
*females: 5 ng/L or pg/mL
*males: 12 ng/L or pg/mL
*children under 6 months of age: 40 ng/L or pg/mL
*children between 6 months and 3 years of age: 15 ng/L or pg/mL
When over 3 years of age, adult cutoffs may be used

A Cochrane systematic review assessed the diagnostic accuracy of basal and stimulated calcitonin for Medullary Thyroid cancer. Although both basal and combined basal and stimulated calcitonin testing presented high accuracy (sensitivity: between 82% and 100%; specificity: between 97.2% and 100%), these results had a high risk of bias due to design flaws of included studies. Overall, the value of routine testing of calcitonin for diagnosis and prognosis of Medullary Thyroid Cancer remains uncertain and questionable.

Increased levels of calcitonin have also been reported for various other conditions. They include: C-cell hyperplasia, nonthyroidal oat cell carcinoma, nonthyroidal carcinoma and other nonthyroidal malignancies, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure, hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, and other gastrointestinal disorders, and pulmonary disease.

===Structure===
Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone of 32 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 3454.93 daltons. Its structure comprises a single alpha helix. Alternative splicing of the gene coding for calcitonin produces a distantly related peptide of 37 amino acids, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), beta type.

The following are the amino acid sequences of salmon and human calcitonin:

* salmon: 
Cys-Ser-Asn-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Val-Leu-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Gln-Glu-Leu-His-Lys-Leu-Gln-Thr-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Asn-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Pro
* human: 
Cys-Gly-Asn-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Met-Leu-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Gln-Asp-Phe-Asn-Lys-Phe-His-Thr-Phe-Pro-Gln-Thr-Ala-Ile-Gly-Val-Gly-Ala-Pro

Compared to salmon calcitonin, human calcitonin differs at 16 residues.

==Research==
In addition to the injectable and nasal spray dosage forms of the salmon calcitonin, noninvasive oral formulations of the peptide are currently under clinical development. The short-half-life of this peptide in serum triggered several attempts to enhance plasma concentrations. The peptide is complexed with a macromolecule that acts as an absorption enhancer through the transcellular pathway and, additionally, protects the peptide from the harsh pH and enzymatic conditions of the GI tract. This complexation is weak, noncovalent and reversible and the drug remains chemically unmodified. After passage through the intestine, the delivery agent dissociates from the peptide. One of the extensively studied oral formulations is the disodium salts of 5-CNAC oral calcitonin. This novel oral platform in a number of clinical trials at different phases has demonstrated promising enhanced pharmacokinetic profile, high bioavailability, well-established safety and comparable efficacy to that of nasal calcitonin especially for treatment of postmenopausal bone loss.
