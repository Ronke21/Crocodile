<text>Come On Over is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain. Mercury Records in North America released it on November 4, 1997. Similar to her work on its predecessor, &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; (1995), Twain entirely collaborated with producer and then-husband Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. With both having busy schedules, they often wrote apart and later intertwined their ideas. Twain wanted to improve her songwriting skills and write a conversational album reflecting her personality and beliefs. The resulting songs explore themes of romance and female empowerment, addressed with humour.

Produced by Lange, &quot;Come On Over&quot; is a country pop album with pop and rock influences. The songs contain country instrumentation such as acoustic guitars, fiddles, and pedal steel, in addition to rock riffs and electric guitars. She released an international version on February 16, 1998, with a pop-oriented production that toned down the country instrumentation. Then Twain embarked on the Come On Over Tour, which ran from May 1998 to December 1999. The album spawned 12 singles, including three U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-ten hits: &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;, &quot;From This Moment On&quot; and &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much.&quot;

&quot;Come On Over&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated the album&#x27;s crossover appeal and country-pop experimentation, while others criticized the lyrics and questioned its country music categorization. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999, &quot;Come On Over&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Country Album.

The album reached number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while topping the charts in multiple countries, including Australia, Canada, and the UK. With sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, &quot;Come On Over&quot; was recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the biggest-selling studio album of all time by a solo female artist. It is the best-selling country album in the U.S., and was certified 20× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2004. Retrospectively, music journalists praised the album for revolutionizing country music, both musically and visually, and discussed its influence on subsequent country artists.

== Background ==
Canadian singer Shania Twain signed to U.S. label Mercury Nashville Records in 1991, and released her eponymous debut studio album in April 1993. It was a commercial failure, reaching number 67 on the U.S. Top Country Albums chart and selling just over 100,000 copies. However, the music video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;What Made You Say That,&quot; and Twain&#x27;s singing voice attracted the interest of Zambian record producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. The two collaborated on songwriting via phone calls, and met for the first time at the Nashville Fan Fair festival in June 1993. Soon after, they established a romantic relationship and wedded in December 1993. Together they worked on Twain&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Woman in Me.&quot; They released it in 1995, and it represented Twain&#x27;s break with the conventional country music formula to experiment with a rock-influenced country pop sound.

It sold over 10 million copies, surpassing &quot;Patsy Cline&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (1967) as the best-selling female country album of all time, and establishing Twain as a sensation on the country music scene. &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; spawned four number-one singles on the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart and won Album of the Year and Best Country Album at the 31st Academy of Country Music Awards and the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, respectively. Despite the commercial success, Twain refused to embark on a tour to support it. Her risky decision sparked criticism and speculation from Nashville industry experts that she was a manufactured artist with no ability to perform live. Twain cited a lack of logistical support, her reluctance to sing cover songs due to not having enough powerful music, and also a desire to take time off and focus on writing songs for her next album. A concert tour, she suggested, would have distracted her from improving her songwriting.

== Writing ==
As with &quot;The Woman in Me,&quot; Twain and Lange composed all of the songs on &quot;Come On Over.&quot; They crafted material for the album &quot;sporadically&quot; as early as 1994, including &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way.&quot; Twain composed the lyrics at Michael Bolton&#x27;s New Jersey home, while Lange worked on Bolton&#x27;s 1995 greatest hits compilation. Due to Twain&#x27;s busy promotional schedule for &quot;The Woman in Me,&quot; she and Lange often worked separately, and then later amalgamated the parts. Twain documented her ideas on devices she carried with her at all times. She wrote rough drafts of music and lyrics in a notebook, and recorded bits of melodies on a small tape recorder or a MiniDisc. She explained, &quot;We write everywhere. When we&#x27;re driving to the grocery store we write. Sometimes, I come up with a melody when we&#x27;re in the car and if I didn&#x27;t bring the tape deck, I have to sing it all the way home so I don&#x27;t forget it. When I get home I run to the tape deck to record it.&quot; Twain&#x27;s longtime friend, Hélène Bolduc, noted how the singer perpetually observed others. She then wrote these observations in her notebook, and later referred to them while composing or when coming up with a title.

When Twain and Lange wrote together, it was typically after they had spent significant time in each other&#x27;s company. The couple found it difficult to compose music after being separated for a long time. Rather than scheduling time for songwriting, they waited for it to surface gradually. The pair wrote much of the material when they were relaxed, almost bored, because that was when the process felt most natural. While Twain concentrated on the concepts and themes, Lange worked on the music and arrangements. Conceiving &quot;Come On Over&quot; as a conversational album, Twain incorporated common phrases used in everyday language into her songwriting. As a result of the positive response to &quot;The Woman in Me,&quot; she also felt &quot;freer and more comfortable&quot; to continue writing songs that expressed her personal beliefs and attitudes. &quot;People seemed to like hearing my perspective from a woman&#x27;s point of view,&quot; she said, &quot;and they seemed to like a sense of humour, so it seemed natural to continue on with that.&quot;

== Production and recording ==
Twain and Lange began the recording process for &quot;Come On Over&quot; in late 1996. Before recording, Lange called session drummer Paul Leim and played him every song, singing and accompanying himself on guitar. Wanting to capture &quot;a real fun Motown feel,&quot; Lange had several conversations with audio engineer Jeff Balding, singing and detailing the musical direction. Balding added, &quot;A lot of thought went into it before we came into the studio to do the tracks.&quot; All tracks were recorded over three weeks at Masterfonics Tracking Room in Nashville, Tennessee. Finding the right location to place the drum kit was one challenging task, and they tested several locations. Leim recorded the drums for most songs in a room with a stone floor, and walls made of reflective rock faces. He recorded the ballads in &quot;small &#x27;dead booths.&#x27;&quot; Joe Chemay played electric and fretless bass, Biff Watson played acoustic and nylon-string guitar, and Twain sang scratch vocals. Steppenwolf member Larry Byrom played the slide guitar tracks, and then recorded them at the GBT Studio. Olle Romo programmed the music at Sven Studios in Mamaroneck, New York. Twain and Lange recorded the background vocals in Toronto at the Glenn Gould Studio, and later returned to Masterfonics for overdubs.

Whilst having a specific vision for the sound of the songs, Lange also left room for the musicians to come up with their own touches. Recalling the recording of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way,&quot; Chemay remarked: &quot;The fretless bass allowed me to slide and make gradual note and pitch changes. I had quite a lot of input on that song.&quot; For the fiddle recording, both Twain and Lange were of the opinion that the instruments did not sound &quot;big enough.&quot; Thus, Lange brought in four fiddle players: Rob Hajacos, Joe Spivey, Glen Duncan, and Aubrey Haynie. They played the exact same part in unison. Additional engineer Bob Bullock noted that this technique made the instruments sound big without being cluttered, creating a different effect than &quot;simply doubling or tripling a part by the same player.&quot; For some songs they placed microphones six to eight inches from each fiddle. For other songs, all four fiddle players stood in a semicircle, using two Neumann KM 582 microphones. After recording was finished, Mike Shipley mixed &quot;Come On Over&quot; using a SSL 9000 J console. Glenn Meadows at Masterfonics mastered the album with a SADiE&#x27;s Apogee UV22 plug-in.

== Musical style ==
Music critics debated the album&#x27;s genre. Most categorized &quot;Come On Over&quot; as country pop. Christopher O&#x27;Connor of MTV News and Miriam Longino of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; remarked that the songs combined country music instruments, such as fiddles, pedal steel, and acoustic guitars, with radio-friendly pop hooks. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Allison Hussey stated that &quot;fiddles are the key element in transmitting &quot;Come On Over&quot;″s country core,&quot; but the &quot;smeared edges of [Twain and Lange&#x27;s] production [...] master the illusion of genre.&quot; Others argued that the album&#x27;s production leaned more toward pop and adult contemporary music than country. Twain described &quot;Come On Over&quot; as a diverse and upbeat album that equally combined elements of country, pop, and rock music. Many critics noted rock influences in the album&#x27;s instrumentation.

According to Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; the verses on &quot;Come On Over&quot; contained &quot;a big, blunt rock beat,&quot; while the choruses were country, with fiddles and pedal steel guitars. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!,&quot; uses twang vocal delivery, synthesized strings, and electric guitar, which some journalists compared to Norman Greenbaum&#x27;s &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; (1969). Described as a &quot;country-pop-metal mix,&quot; &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time&quot; blends steel and &quot;funky&quot; electric guitars with fiddle and pedal steel. &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; is an uptempo country rock track featuring bluesy fiddles, guitars, and drums. It incorporates a stomp-clap rhythm which some critics found similar to Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (1977). &quot;If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!&quot; and &quot;Black Eyes, Blue Tears&quot; are guitar-driven songs; the former is a blues rock song, while the latter features grunge pop influences.

&quot;I Won&#x27;t Leave You Lonely&quot; is a &quot;European-flavored&quot; song with juxtaposed accordions and pedal steel. The rhythm guitar track has been noted for its similarities to the Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (1983). On &quot;Rock This Country!,&quot; Twain sings over &quot;pounding&quot; beats, power chords, electric guitars, and fiddles. Some critics described other tracks with more uptempo productions, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)&quot; and &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much,&quot; as dance-able country pop numbers. In addition to an electronic Caribbean beat, the mandolin and accordion-led Latin percussion on the title track create a Cajun sound. Among the ballads on the album, &quot;From This Moment On&quot; combines country and rock elements. The piano-based &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; features breathy vocals and instrumentation from guitar, organ, and mandolin. The closing track &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way&quot; is a Spanish guitar-driven ballad with &quot;gentle&quot; drums.

== Lyrics and themes ==
Thematically and lyrically, Twain and Lange focused on accentuating the positive. Thus, Twain omitted personal details and focused on entertaining her listeners. &quot;People ask me, &#x27;What do you want people to get from your music?&#x27; And I say, &#x27;I want them to be entertained.&#x27; That&#x27;s really the bottom line. I&#x27;m not sending out some subliminal message or trying to change the consciousness of people.&quot; The songs on &quot;Come On Over&quot; reflect Twain&#x27;s concerns, interests, and day-to-day preoccupations. She conveyed her personality through &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;sassy&quot; lyrics, as per Lange&#x27;s encouragement, and she approached her topics with humor. She sourced many of the titles&#x27; pert puns, exclamation marks, and double entendres from Lange. According to music industry executive Ralph Simon &quot;[Lange] was always the master of the double entendre; if ever there is some sexual ambiguity in the lyric, it&#x27;s down to [him].&quot; The album&#x27;s predominant themes were love and romantic relationships. &quot;I&#x27;m Holdin&#x27; On to Love (To Save My Life)&quot; contains references to horoscopes, the internet, psychiatrists, and Dr. Ruth as &quot;superficial crutches&quot; to save one&#x27;s life rather than love. In &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You),&quot; Twain reassures a jealous and possessive partner.

&quot;From This Moment On&quot; is a duet with country singer Bryan White. Twain originally wrote the song with another artist in mind, hoping to pitch it to a &quot;powerhouse&quot; vocalist like Céline Dion. However, Lange convinced Twain to record it, although she initially felt uncomfortable singing a power ballad. &quot;When&quot; used metaphors and scenarios of an idealistic world to describe a broken relationship. Twain said it was her favorite song lyrically: &quot;I love the whole concept. It&#x27;s a neat way of saying &#x27;never&#x27; about a relationship. Like saying &#x27;when hell freezes over&#x27; without saying that.&quot; The &quot;wry, chiding&quot; humorous lyrics of &quot;Whatever You Do! Don&#x27;t!&quot; find a vulnerable Twain &quot;falling head over heels for a guy who seems to do everything just right.&quot; In &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One,&quot; she celebrates a successful relationship that has prevailed despite turmoil, hardships, and criticism. The lyrics were inspired by her marriage to her then-husband Lange, and the people who considered their relationship unlikely to succeed. The tongue-in-cheek &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; depicts her indifferent attitude toward self-absorbed men who emphasize material things, intelligence, or physical beauty, rather than personality and heart. In &quot;I Won&#x27;t Leave You Lonely,&quot; Twain added verses in French and Spanish to broaden the song&#x27;s universal appeal.

Apart from romance, &quot;Come On Over&quot; explores women&#x27;s issues and experiences. &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; is a self-celebratory song about female empowerment, hedonism, and women&#x27;s liberty. &quot;If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!&quot; explores themes of sexual consent and respecting a woman&#x27;s personal space. Twain said the song was inspired by awkward feelings she experienced in her adolescence due to her physical development. However, she decided to write it from a positive perspective and sing about how to sensitively approach a woman. Twain narrates the role reversal song &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; from the perspective of a working woman coming home after a difficult day and demanding that her partner take care of her. The song drew some comparisons to Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980). &quot;Black Eyes, Blue Tears&quot; is about domestic abuse and depicts a woman leaving a physically abusive relationship, with lyrics such as &quot;I&#x27;d rather die standing than live on my knees, begging please.&quot; Twain wrote this from an optimistic perspective, and associated the song&#x27;s theme with the 1991 American film &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise.&quot; &quot;I wanted to show that there&#x27;s life after abuse, as opposed to doom and destruction.&quot;

== Packaging and release ==
Twain originally wanted to title the album &quot;No Inhibitions,&quot; but opted for &quot;Come On Over&quot; because she considered the title track one of her favorites and appreciated its inviting nature. She released the album in North America on November 4, 1997, through Mercury Records. With 16 songs and a running time of slightly over an hour, &quot;Come On Over&quot; distinguished itself by deviating from the traditional standard of &quot;cheap, short&quot; country albums, typically consisting of only 10-12 tracks and a duration of under 35–40 minutes. George Holz designed the red and white cover artwork. It depicted Twain in a &quot; pose,&quot; wearing a red shirt and holding her hands over her head.

When the album was complete, Lange spent four months remixing it for international release. He removed country elements from the songs to achieve a &quot;universal&quot; pop-oriented sound. He made the snare drums, fiddles, and pedal steel more subtle, and replaced them with pop beats, drum loops, keyboards, and synthesizers. 15 songs underwent sonic changes, with the exception of &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; which remained in its original version. For &quot;From This Moment On,&quot; Twain sang solo. She also recorded two new versions, one in collaboration with Brazilian duo Chitãozinho &amp; Xororó, and another with Irish singer Ronan Keating. However, these versions of &quot;From This Moment On&quot; were never released.

Twain and Lange released the international version of &quot;Come On Over&quot; in continental Europe on February 16, 1998, with a different track order and new artwork. The cover showed Twain with tousled hair, wearing a sleeveless silver gown, and turning toward the camera. They released a special edition in Australia in 1998 featuring a live version of &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; and dance mixes for &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You).&quot; The Australian tour edition included a second disc. It contained an additional single mix of &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; (1996), a live medley of &quot;Home Ain&#x27;t Where His Heart Is (Anymore),&quot; &quot;The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)&quot; (1995), and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way,&quot; and the original country version of &quot;From This Moment On.&quot;

In 1999 they issued a revised international edition of &quot;Come On Over.&quot; It included the pop radio mixes of &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; and &quot;From This Moment On,&quot; the &quot;Notting Hill&quot; remix of &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way,&quot; and the &quot;UK dance mix&quot; of &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much.&quot; They released this version in the U.S. on November 23, 1999, after the singles&#x27; success on pop radio. In Japan, they released a limited edition 10 days earlier. It featured both a radio edit and the album version of &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One,&quot; as well as a &quot;Mach 3 remix&quot; of &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time.&quot; They released a version on increasingly popular vinyl on December 2, 2016. They offered a special edition of &quot;Come On Over&quot; digitally on December 4, 2022. This included two live versions of &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; with Elton John and Chris Martin, and a live version of &quot;Party for Two&quot; (2004) with Nick Jonas.

In July 2023, during the Queen of Me Tour, Twain announced &quot;Come On Over: Diamond Edition,&quot; to celebrate the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, released on August 25, 2023.

== Promotion ==
Mercury implemented an extensive promotional campaign for &quot;Come On Over.&quot; To market it, Twain performed &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time&quot; at the 1997 Country Music Association Awards and held album signing sessions in the U.S. at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, and in Canada at the Southcentre Mall in Calgary. She appeared on a series of American television shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&quot; &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,&quot; &quot;Late Night with David Letterman,&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; For the international release in Europe, she conducted press interviews and performed &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; on &quot;The National Lottery Live&quot; in the U.K. On February 26, 1998, Twain appeared on TNN&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time Country.&quot; She sang songs from both &quot;The Woman In Me&quot; and &quot;Come On Over,&quot; and then Gary Chapman interviewed her. In March 1998, Twain embarked on a promotional tour in Australia. She appeared on &quot;Midday,&quot; &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday Night,&quot; and performed at the Australian Grand Prix concert in Melbourne.

At the VH1 Divas concert on April 14, 1998, she sang &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One.&quot; In September 1998, Twain became the first female country singer to appear on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine since Dolly Parton in 1980. She also performed at award shows, including the Canadian Country Music Awards, Country Music Association Awards, and &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. Promotion continued throughout 1999, with Twain appearing again on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Country.&quot; On February 24, 1999, Twain sang &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; at the 41st Grammy Awards ceremony. She returned to the U.K. in July and September 1999 to perform at Capital Radio&#x27;s Party in the Park and &quot;Top of the Pops,&quot; respectively. At the 1999 Country Music Association Awards, Twain performed &quot;Come On Over.&quot; In the U.K., a &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; special aired on BBC Two on December 8, 1999, where Twain sang &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; and &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much,” among other songs.

=== Singles ===
Out of the album&#x27;s 16 songs, 12 were released as singles. In North America, promoters pushed &quot;Come On Over&quot; as a country album, while internationally categorizing it as pop. Promoters serviced the first two singles, &quot;Love Gets Me Every Time&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You),&quot; only to country radio stations and both peaked within the top 40 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The former was a five-week number one on the Hot Country Songs charts, while the latter was a top-ten hit on the same. &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; had a crossover release to U.S. pop radio on January 13, 1998, and was the first single the team released in Europe on February 2, 1998. In addition to reaching number-one in Australia and on the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart, the song peaked at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, at number seven on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart, and at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Mercury relied on a crossover marketing strategy for the following singles, sending songs to pop stations only after they achieved success on country stations. On May 4, 1998, Twain and Lange&#x27;s team released &quot;From This Moment On&quot; to U.S. country stations as the fourth single, and it peaked at number six on the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart. They later serviced it to U.S. pop stations on August 25, 1998, and it peaked within the top 10 in Australia, the U.K., and the U.S.

&quot;When&quot; had a limited release in Europe on June 1, 1998. Twain released the original version of &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; to U.S. country stations on December 7, 1998, and released a dance remix to U.S. pop stations on February 23, 1999. It was the album&#x27;s most successful single internationally, topping the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, and Norway. It achieved top 10 positions in other territories, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Way&quot; and &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman!&quot; had crossover releases to U.S. pop stations throughout 1999, and peaked at numbers 49 and 23 respectively on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The promoters also serviced more singles to U.S. country stations: &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; (August 10, 1998), &quot;Come On Over&quot; (September 7, 1999), &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; (January 10, 2000), and &quot;I&#x27;m Holdin&#x27; On to Love (To Save My Life)&quot; (July 2000). All songs peaked within the top 30 of the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart, with &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; at number one and &quot;Come On Over&quot; at number six. They released a dance remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)&quot; as the album&#x27;s final single in Europe on February 7, 2000.

=== Touring ===
To further promote the album, Twain embarked on the Come On Over Tour, her first as a headliner. It kicked off in Sudbury, Northern Ontario, on May 29, 1998, and concluded in West Palm Beach, Florida, on December 5, 1999. Outside North America, the Come On Over Tour visited Australia, Ireland, and the U.K. It grossed over $70 million from 165 shows and received generally positive reviews. Music critics appreciated Twain&#x27;s energetic performances as she refuted those earlier accusations of being unable to sing live, and they praised the show&#x27;s production. The tour visited Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas, on September 12, 1998, and DirecTV broadcast it live. A CBS TV special titled &quot;Shania Twain&#x27;s Winter Break&quot; premiered on March 3, 1999. Filmmakers documented the tour on January 15 and 16, 1999, at the Bayfront Park Amphitheater in Miami, Florida. Elton John joined Twain on stage to sing a medley of &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; and &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot; (1997). Backstreet Boys also appeared at the concert, singing &quot;From This Moment On&quot; alongside Twain. CBS taped a second TV special at Texas Stadium, and it aired on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999.

== Critical reception ==
As noted earlier, &quot;Come On Over&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Those who were complimentary applauded it for exploring the limits of country music. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic remarked that &quot;Come On Over&quot; transcended boundaries due to its rock-oriented production, writing that despite the relative absence of country elements, Twain &quot;sticks to what she does best, which is countrified mainstream pop.&quot; &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Paul Verna similarly stated that &quot;country&#x27;s traditions are being reinvented and redefined,&quot; calling &quot;Come On Over&quot; &quot;the future of power pop merging with country.&quot; Some critics, however, took issue with the album&#x27;s genre classification as country. Robert Christgau asserted that &quot;Come On Over&quot; &quot;has nothing to do with country,&quot; and Jeffrey Lee Puckett of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; felt that &quot;[it] sounds more like a pop singer flirting with country.&quot; &quot;The Tennessean&#x27;s&quot; Tom Roland added that the array of rock references hardly made the album sound country. Conversely, J. D. Considine of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; cited the country chorus on &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m Home&quot; as an example of how &quot;superficial Twain&#x27;s rock trappings are,&quot; concluding that &quot;Lange has no need to countrify every arrangement for credibility&#x27;s sake.&quot;

Reviews in the &quot;Dayton Daily News,&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer,&quot; the &quot;Vancouver Sun,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the album&#x27;s mainstream appeal and catchy melodies, and touted Lange&#x27;s production. Other reviews from &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,&quot; the &quot;Austin American-Statesman,&quot; the &quot;New York Daily News,&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; were negative, dismissing the album as &quot;unforgivably bland,&quot; forgettable, and uninspired. Twain&#x27;s lyrical content drew criticism for lacking depth, and some called it &quot;predictable&quot; (the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;) and &quot;cliched&quot; (the &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot;). Hussey opined that Twain avoided controversy and was &quot;the first to insist that her songs are meant to be fun, and it is OK to enjoy them on those terms alone.&quot; In the &quot;Miami Herald,&quot; Howard Cohen disliked the album&#x27;s &quot;lazy&quot; production and &quot;insipid&quot; lyrics, but complimented the international version for removing &quot;the forced country instrumentation&quot; and revealing &quot;the finely crafted pop it really is.&quot; &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Mary Tartaglione and &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Adam Sweeting were critical, deeming the international version&#x27;s production &quot;overly polished&quot; and &quot;manufactured.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
At the 1998 Canadian Country Music Association Awards, &quot;Come On Over&quot; won Album of the Year and was declared the Top Selling Album. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 33rd Academy of Country Music Awards, the 1998 Country Music Association Awards, and the 1998 Juno Awards.

== Commercial performance ==
In 2015, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized &quot;Come On Over&quot; as the biggest-selling studio album by a female solo artist, with over 40 million copies sold worldwide.

=== Americas ===
In Canada, &quot;Come On Over&quot; debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart with first-week sales of 51,840 copies. Twain became the first country artist to debut at number one since the introduction of the Nielsen SoundScan system for tracking album sales. The album spent five weeks atop the chart. By December 2014 it had sold 1.94 million copies, making it the best-selling album since the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan in Canada in 1995. Music Canada (MC) certified &quot;Come On Over&quot; double diamond for shipments of two million units. In the U.S., &quot;Come On Over&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for November 22, 1997, with first-week sales of 172,000 copies. Mase&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Harlem World,&quot; which sold 3,000 more copies than &quot;Come On Over,&quot; held it off from reaching the top spot. The album remained second behind Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; selling 170,000 units in the second week.

&quot;Come On Over&quot; experienced its highest weekly sales during Christmas week 1999, selling 355,000 copies. It spent 50 weeks at number one on the U.S. Top Country Albums chart, breaking the record for the longest-running number-one album. It was the fourth best-selling album of both 1998 and 1999 in the U.S., selling 4.9 million and 5.62 million copies, respectively. By October 2019, the album had sold 15.73 million pure copies in the U.S. It is the best-selling country album and the second best-selling album in the U.S. since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began in 1991, behind Metallica&#x27;s 1991 self-titled album. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 20× platinum (double diamond), denoting 20 million units shipped. In Latin America, &quot;Come On Over&quot; was certified gold in Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay and platinum in Argentina.

=== Europe and Oceania ===
The album topped the pancontinental European Top 100 Albums chart for two consecutive weeks. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified it 7× platinum in 2001, denoting sales of seven million copies across Europe. &quot;Come On Over&quot; was a sleeper success in the U.K. In the week ending March 21, 1998, the album debuted at number 15 on the Albums Chart. After a year and a half of fluctuating on the chart, it climbed to number one in its 74th week, with sales of 57,000 copies. The best sales week was the one ending December 25, 1999, with 278,000 copies sold. &quot;Come On Over&quot; spent 11 weeks at number one and was the best-selling album of 1999 in the U.K. with sales of 2.2 million copies. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it 11× platinum and sold 3.51 million copies by January 2023, making it the 15th best-selling album in the U.K. of all time. Across Europe, &quot;Come On Over&quot; reached number one in Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. It received multi-platinum certifications in Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland (3× platinum), the Netherlands (5× platinum), Norway (6× platinum), and Denmark (7× platinum).

In Australia, &quot;Come On Over&quot; topped the Australian Albums Chart for 20 weeks and was the best-selling album of 1999 in the country. By December 1999, the album had sold one million units in Australia. It was certified 25× platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for earning over 1.75 million album-equivalent units in the nation. The album spent 23 weeks at number one on the New Zealand Albums Chart and received a 21× platinum certification from Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for shipments of over 315,000 units.

== Legacy ==
In a March 1999 article in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen,&quot; Lynn Saxberg wrote that &quot;Come On Over&quot; &quot;pushed new country as far as it will go&quot; and &quot;may be remembered as [...] the epitome of the pop-rock influence on country music.&quot; Ron Corbett from the same publication considered Twain&#x27;s crossover success to be the first of its kind: &quot;In Nashville, they say the streets are littered with the bones of artists who tried to cross over to pop, only to end up killing their careers. Ms. Twain may turn out to be the exception.&quot; In retrospect, journalists hailed Twain as the pioneer of 1990s country-pop crossovers and observed the impact of &quot;Come On Over&quot; in country music. Alex Hopper of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; considered the album to be Twain&#x27;s magnum opus and said that its country-pop crossovers &quot;were something entirely new upon their release.&quot; In Jocelyn R. Neal&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Country Music: A Cultural and Stylistic History,&quot; Neal acknowledged Twain as the driving force behind the &quot;major stylistic shift in country music toward country-pop.&quot;

Larry Delaney of &quot;Country Music News&quot; said that the album introduced country music to a large and new audience of young listeners. Writing for Wide Open Country, Bobbie Jean Sawyer applauded the album for being &quot;a benchmark moment for country music.&quot; He noted its impact on female country artists &quot;less concerned with a strict adherence to genre and more concerned with being true to themselves,&quot; including Kelsea Ballerini, Maren Morris, Carly Pearce, Carrie Underwood, and Taylor Swift. Taylor Weatherby of &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;Come On Over&quot; &quot;a brilliant fusion of country, pop and rock that it quickly solidified Twain&#x27;s legacy.&quot; Alison Hussey of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; observed how the album&#x27;s success &quot;changed Nashville forever&quot; and redefined the categorization of country music. According to her, Twain set a new standard of country-pop crossovers, recognizing her influence on subsequent careers of Bomshel, Rascal Flatts, Faith Hill, and Underwood.

Pandora music analyst Kevin Seal pointed out that the &quot;euphoric quality&quot; of the songs had a &quot;huge effect on Nashville production&quot; and shaped the sound of upcoming country productions. Medium&#x27;s Glenn Peoples likewise dubbed the music &quot;ahead of its time.&quot; He cited Underwood&#x27;s &quot;All-American Girl&quot; (2007) and &quot;Good Girl&quot; (2012) as songs &quot;that would work well on &quot;Come On Over,&quot;&quot; referring to the female empowerment theme of the former and the instrumentation of the latter. &quot;The Independent&#x27;s&quot; Roisin O&#x27;Connor linked the &quot;winking, sarcastic tone&quot; of &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; to Taylor Swift&#x27;s music, specifically citing &quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&quot; (2012) and &quot;Blank Space&quot; (2014), and concluding, &quot;Without Shania, there likely wouldn&#x27;t be a Taylor.&quot; In 2021, Swift thanked Twain on the video-sharing service TikTok for eradicating the misconception that &quot;country girls can&#x27;t go to pop.&quot; Twain told &quot;Billboard&quot; that the risk she took by exploring her diversity inspired female country artists like Swift and Miranda Lambert to be confident in being &quot;artistically expressive and unique.&quot;

Journalists have noted that Twain&#x27;s image and fashion throughout the album cycle altered the public&#x27;s perception of country music&#x27;s visual representation. Some have credited the visual aspect of Twain&#x27;s music videos, which benefited from heavy airplay on stations such as CMT, MTV, and VH1, as conveying a message that &quot;country music doesn&#x27;t have to look like just one thing.&quot; Peoples described Twain&#x27;s music videos as &quot;visually stunning, mixing glamour, romanticism, and often vibrant colors.&quot; &quot;National Post&#x27;s&quot; Jeff Breithaupt accredited the success of &quot;Come On Over&quot; to the marketing strategy of &quot;slow roll-outs of hit singles and expensive videos,&quot; and compared it to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). Other journalists commented that a vast audience of &quot;underseen, under-engaged&quot; female listeners who identified with its female empowerment themes embraced it. O&#x27;Connor cited &quot;Black Eyes, Blue Tears&quot; and &quot;If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!&quot; for their timely relevance in light of the #MeToo movement, calling the album &quot;an overlooked feminist masterpiece.&quot;

&quot;Consequence&quot; ranked &quot;Come On Over&quot; as the ninth-best album of 1997, and praised it for pushing the boundaries of country music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their 2020 revised list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at number 300. The same publication later placed the album at number eight in its 2022 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Albums of All Time.&quot; Editor Natalie Weiner found the songs &quot;addictive,&quot; and commended both the &quot;wild creativity&quot; and Twain and Lange&#x27;s &quot;dangerously sharp commercial instincts,&quot; as well as their &quot;fearless embrace of an audience too often overlooked by country music: women.&quot; In their ranking of the &quot;150 Greatest Albums Made by Women,&quot; NPR listed &quot;Come On Over&quot; at number 89. Ann Powers opined that the album&#x27;s sonic innovations were &quot;forward thinking,&quot; revolutionizing the country genre.

<text>What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East is a book by Bernard Lewis released in January 2002, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attack, but written shortly before. The nucleus of this book appeared as an article published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in January 2002.

The book&#x27;s thesis is that throughout recent history, specifically beginning with the failure of the second Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683, the Islamic world has failed to modernize or to keep pace with the Western world in a variety of respects, and that this failure has been seen by many within the Islamic world as having allowed Western powers to acquire a disastrous position of dominance over those regions.

<doc id="472494" wikidata="Q1976781" url="?curid=472494" title="The Woman in Me (album)">
<text>The Woman in Me is the second studio album by Canadian country singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her first to be produced by long-time collaborator and then-husband Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Released on February 7, 1995, it went on to become her biggest-selling recording at the time, selling 4 million copies by the end of the year, and was eventually certified 12× Platinum by the RIAA on December 1, 2000, for 12 million shipments throughout the United States. The album has sold an estimated 20 million copies worldwide. It was ranked number 8 on CMT&#x27;s list of &quot;40 Greatest Albums in Country Music&quot; in 2006. The album is credited with having influenced the sound of contemporary country music. Eight singles were released from the album for its promotion, including &quot;Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?&quot;, &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot;, &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; and &quot;You Win My Love&quot;, with each accompanied by a music video.

==Background==
By 1993, Shania Twain was promoting her self-titled debut album by singing at local gigs in the United States with little more than a backing track CD. While the album itself did not perform well in the charts, it attracted the attention of rock producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, and the pair began having long-distance telephone conversations with each other. They bonded over Twain&#x27;s love of rock music and Lange&#x27;s love of American country music. After meeting with him at the CMA Music Festival/Fan Fair in June 1993, they began exchanging song ideas with each other and started doing songwriting together. During this time, they developed a romance that culminated in their wedding on December 28, 1993.

It was at this time that Twain was pressed by her record company to return to the studio to start putting together her second album. Twain admitted in her &quot;From This Moment On&quot; memoir that although she was initially reluctant to do so, she told Luke Lewis that she had co-written some songs with Lange, and he agreed to let her record some demos for her album, even though he feared that Twain would deviate too much from the Nashville sound. Twain and Lange continued their songwriting after their wedding and in early 1994, constructed a demo tape produced by Lange of some of their songs which was played to record executives for the first time at Morin Heights Studio. Although some executives were worried because the &quot;less country&quot; sound was different from Twain&#x27;s debut, Lewis decided to let Twain continue her collaboration with Lange, and hired Lange as the primary producer of the album.

==Composition and single releases==
&quot;Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?&quot;, a country-flavored song about a woman confronting her lover about his frequent infidelity, was released as the first single from the album. Originally, Twain wanted &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot;, a song containing both heavy rock and heavy country influences, to be the first single, but was persuaded to change her mind and go with the safer option. While &quot;Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?&quot; slowly gained some attention on the country charts, it was &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot; which gave Twain her first country Top 10 and Number 1 hit, as well as her first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 31. The third single is Twain&#x27;s sentimental ballad and the title track &quot;The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)&quot;, and became her first adult contemporary hit, accompanied by a video shot in Egypt. It also peaked at number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, an a cappella prayer that Twain prayed to herself after her parents died, was originally the last track recorded for the album in 1994. However, in early 1995, just prior to the album release, Twain and Lange experimented with recording different versions of songs for both country audiences and pop-rock audiences. This meant that the two songs in consideration, the fourth single &quot;(If You&#x27;re Not in It for Love) I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot;, described by Twain as &quot;a warning to pickup artists everywhere, set to a pulsating rock beat, and embroidered with slinky slide guitar&quot; and fifth single &quot;You Win My Love&quot;, a solely Lange-written love song involving car metaphors, actually had their country and pop-rock counterparts recorded at the same time. Just before the track-listing was finalised, separate country and pop-rock mixes were derived from the original masters, as Twain and Lange intended to release both mixes to the release formats of the album. The pop-rock mixes were shelved in favor of the country mixes during the album&#x27;s release, but returned billed as &quot;Mutt Lange Mix&quot;es for both songs&#x27; single releases. &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; and &quot;You Win My Love&quot; became Twain&#x27;s second and third No.1 hits at country radio, while &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Here!&quot; became Twain&#x27;s first breakthrough hit in Australia. &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Here&quot; also peaked at number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After more success with another No.1 hit, sixth single &quot;No One Needs to Know&quot;, which was selected for the soundtrack to the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;, and a minor country hit, seventh single &quot;Home Ain&#x27;t Where His Heart Is (Anymore)&quot;, Twain decided to turn &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, the eighth and final single, into a full-length song. She and Lange co-wrote new verses touching on the turbulent lives in people&#x27;s society, and Lange developed two new instrumentals for Twain to record her vocals on: a country version with a banjo and a pop version with a subtle electronic beat. Both versions contain the same acoustic drum set, guitars and chord arrangements, and also feature the Fisk University Jubilee singers and a local performing arts choir on backing vocals. &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; peaked at number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but was her least successful single from the album at country radio, peaking at number 48.

==25th Anniversary==
On October 2, 2020, &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; was re-released as the &quot;Diamond Edition&quot;, which is available in four variants: a limited edition clear crystal vinyl, standard vinyl, 2-CD set and a 3-CD set packaged with a 48-page hard cover book. It is also available as a digital download known as the &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot;. The Diamond Edition is &quot;remastered&quot; with a bonus disc that includes live performances and the single mixes. The 3-CD Set (also the Super Deluxe Edition digital download) version includes a third disc with early recordings of &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, which were recorded 12 months prior to the release of the album.

<doc id="472497" wikidata="Q1573393" url="?curid=472497" title="Shania Twain (album)">
<text>Shania Twain is the debut studio album by Canadian singer Shania Twain, released on April 20, 1993, by Polygram and Mercury Records. After assembling a demo tape to send to labels, Mercury Nashville took an interest and signed her a contract. Unlike her later albums, Twain had very little input on the album.

The album was a commercial flop during its original release, only reaching number 67 on the US Country Albums chart. Three singles were released from the album, none of which cracked the top 40 at country radio. The album was later re-released in 2000 following the massive success of Twain&#x27;s later albums. It was later certified Platinum by the RIAA in 1999.

After her subsequent albums &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; (1995) and especially &quot;Come On Over&quot; (1997) catapulted her to superstardom, Twain essentially disowned this album and has not performed any material from it live following the conclusion of her Come on Over Tour in 1999. Even during the aforementioned tour, only the song &quot;What Made You Say That&quot; was included from the album in her setlist despite her only having three albums of material at the time to draw from. In addition, no selections from it were included on her 2004 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. &quot;What Made You Say That&quot; is included on her Netflix documentary companion compilation album &quot;Not Just a Girl (The Highlights)&quot; released on July 26, 2022.

== Content ==
Five songs were originally recorded by other artists. &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; was recorded by Joe Diffie in 1990, &quot;When He Leaves You&quot; was a single for Donna Meade in 1989, &quot;You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me&quot; was recorded by Con Hunley in 1980 and Tom Jones in 1983, &quot;Still Under the Weather&quot; was recorded by Andy Williams in 1990, and &quot;What Made You Say That&quot; was recorded by Wayne Massey in 1989. In her 2011 autobiography, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;, Twain expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and was frustrated with being unable to showcase her songwriting abilities. However, she did co-write one song on the album titled &quot;God Ain&#x27;t Gonna Getcha for That&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Shania Twain&quot; received favorable reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review, noting that although she had a long way to go, &quot;attention must be paid&quot;. On the other end, Thom Owens of AllMusic gave the album a mixed but mostly negative review, calling it a bland album that even Twain&#x27;s vocals are &quot;too showy to make any of these mediocre songs stick.&quot;

== Singles ==
&quot;What Made You Say That&quot; was released on March 6, 1993 as the lead single from the album and Twain&#x27;s debut single. The song received mostly positive reviews. The song peaked at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks and number 78 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Country Tracks, one of the few times a single of hers performed better in the US than in Canada. The song received attention due to its at-the-time controversial music video, which prominently showed her midriff. The music video was later banned by CMT.

&quot;Dance with the One That Brought You&quot; was chosen as the second single from the album on July 13, 1993, with it also receiving positive reviews. Just like &quot;What Made You Say That&quot;, the song had little success. It reached the same peak position of number 55 on the &quot;Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks&quot; chart and performed better in Canada, reaching number 70 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian Country Tracks chart. Like &quot;What Made You Say That&quot;, the video also received attention, this time for its high-profile director and guest actor. Actor Sean Penn filmed the music video while Charles Durning made an appearance in the music video.

&quot;You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me&quot; was sent to country radio on September 7, 1993 as the third and final single from the &quot;Shania Twain&quot; album. While it did get a few plays, the song completely failed to enter the country charts in either the US or Canada. Despite the failure, a music video was released for the song, which proved to have little success. The song was later released in 1994 in Europe as the only single from the &quot;Shania Twain&quot; album.

<text>A&amp;E (previously known in full as the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network) is an American cable and satellite television network and the flagship property of A&amp;E Networks, a joint venture between Hearst Communications and the Walt Disney Company (through the Disney General Entertainment Content division of Disney Entertainment). A&amp;E was launched on February 1, 1984, as a block on Nickelodeon. The network originally focused on fine arts, documentaries, dramas, and educational entertainment. Today, it deals primarily in non-fiction programming, including reality television, true crime, documentaries and miniseries, thus de-emphasizing its full name in the process. Since 1985, it is no longer a programming block, due to its joint owners spinning it off into a 24-hour channel while Nickelodeon later launched Nick at Nite to fill in the time slot A&amp;E formerly held. , A&amp;E is available to approximately 63,000,000 pay television households in the United States – down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households. The American version of the channel is being distributed in Canada while international versions were launched for Australia, Latin America, and Europe.

== History ==
===1984–2002===

A&amp;E launched on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television homes in the U.S. and Canada. The network is a result of the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC&#x27;s Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel.

It was originally available in two versions, one in an 8-hour version, which was to follow Nickelodeon on RCA Satcom III-R, the other was a full 20-hour version, on another satellite provider, the Westar V. In 1984, the signal split off from Nickelodeon, once A&amp;E picked up its 20-hour signal on RCA Satcom III-R. In response, Nickelodeon launched its own nighttime block Nick at Nite to displace A&amp;E on many signals.

In 1986, the network premiered one of the first classical music videos to be broadcast in the United States and Canada, the Kendall Ross Bean: Chopin Polonaise in A Flat.

By 1990, original programming accounted for 35 to 40 percent of A&amp;E&#x27;s content. &quot;Biography&quot;, a one-hour documentary series that was revived in 1987, was considered to be the network&#x27;s signature show. In 1994, airings of &quot;Biography&quot; went from weekly broadcasts to airing five nights a week, which helped boost A&amp;E&#x27;s ratings to record levels. The nightly series became A&amp;E&#x27;s top-rated show and one of cable television&#x27;s most notable successes. &quot;Biography&quot; received Primetime Emmy Awards in 1999 and 2002.

In 1993, Rockefeller Group’s Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake of A&amp;E to Capital Cities/ABC, Hearst &amp; NBC, NBC owns 25% stake of A&amp;E, while the others 37.5% stake of the two.

In 1994, the channel picked up reruns of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; on an eight-year agreement, which would help bring in additional viewers.

In May 1995, the channel&#x27;s name officially changed to the &quot;A&amp;E Network&quot;, to reflect its declining focus on arts and entertainment. The following year, the network had branded itself as simply A&amp;E, using the slogans &quot;Time Well Spent&quot; and in 1998, &quot;Escape the Ordinary.&quot; &quot;The word &#x27;arts,&#x27; in regard to television, has associations such as &#x27;sometimes elitist,&#x27; &#x27;sometimes boring,&#x27; &#x27;sometimes overly refined&#x27; and &#x27;doesn&#x27;t translate well to TV, Whitney Goit, executive vice president for sales and marketing, stated. &quot;Even the arts patron often finds arts on TV not as satisfying as it should be ... And the word &#x27;entertainment&#x27; is too vague. Therefore, much like ESPN uses its letters rather than what they stand for – Entertainment Sports (Programming) Network – we decided to go to just A&amp;E.&quot; Of the network&#x27;s tagline, Goit said, &quot;Intellectually, &#x27;Time well spent&#x27; defines a comparison between those who view a lot of television as a wasteland, and their acknowledgment that there are good things on TV and that they&#x27;d like to watch more thought-provoking TV.&quot;

A&amp;E and Meridian Broadcasting commissioned &quot;Horatio Hornblower&quot; (1999), winner of two Primetime Emmy Awards, and the seven subsequent dramas in the series; &quot;Dash and Lilly&quot; (1999), which received nine Emmy nominations; and &quot;The Crossing&quot; (2000), which won the Peabody Award. The network created two original weekly drama series, Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;100 Centre Street&quot; and &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, both of which lasted from 2001 to 2002.

===2002–2013===
In 2002, the contract for &quot;Law and Order&quot; had expired with the renewal asking price at four times the original per episode fee. Dropping that show allowed the channel to move to more &quot;brand-defining scripted and nonfiction series.&quot; That same year, A&amp;E would shift its focus toward reality television in order to attract a younger demographic and cancelled the network&#x27;s two original scripted series. In May 2003, A&amp;E launched a marketing campaign with the network&#x27;s new tagline, &quot;The Art of Entertainment.&quot; Between 2003 and 2007, the channel gradually retired several long-running series, moving several shows to The Biography Channel and introducing new reality programming.

In 2005, A&amp;E launched their feature film production arm A&amp;E IndieFilms.

The docudrama &quot;Flight 93&quot;, about the hijacking of the plane which crashed in Pennsylvania during the September 11 attacks, was the most watched program on the network; it attracted 5.9 million viewers for its initial telecast on January 30, 2006. This was later surpassed by &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;&#x27;s third season premiere. The previous record-holder for the network was a World War II docudrama, &quot;Ike: Countdown to D-Day&quot;, starring Tom Selleck and broadcast in 2004, with 5.5 million viewers. A&amp;E later acquired rights to rerun the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;; its A&amp;E premiere on January 10, 2007, averaged 3.86 million viewers, making it the most-watched premiere of a rerun off-network series in cable television history at the time. The series continued to perform well for A&amp;E, and led the network to regularly rank in the top ten basic U.S. cable channels in prime time ratings.

On May 26, 2008, in conjunction with the premiere of the original film &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, A&amp;E rebranded with a new logo and slogan, &quot;Real Life. Drama.&quot;, representing its shift to a more contemporary network with a focus on scripted programming. Additional shows in this major scripted push were drama series &quot;The Cleaner&quot; and &quot;The Beast&quot;, which both lasted two seasons. A&amp;E ordered several dramas for Fall 2009, including projects from Jerry Bruckheimer, Shawn Ryan and Lynda Obst, and a Western miniseries from Kevin Costner.

On July 10, 2012, NBCUniversal (Comcast) has announced it would sell 15.8% stake of A&amp;E to Disney and Hearst, making a both 50-50 joint venture.

===2013–present===
On December 11, 2013, A&amp;E unveiled a new on-air brand identity built around the slogan &quot;Be Original&quot;, emphasizing the network&#x27;s lineup of original productions and positioning it as a &quot;much lighter, more fun place to come and spend time&quot;. The success of &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Bates Motel&quot; and &quot;Storage Wars&quot; put A&amp;E fourth in 2013 among cable channels in the key 18-to-49 age demographic.

On February 20, 2014, A&amp;E Networks UK announced a UK version of the channel to launch on Sky channel 168 on March 24, with a Virgin Media launch date planned for next year. In Spain and Portugal, the channel was launched on October 1, 2014, replacing The Biography Channel in that market.

In 2015, A&amp;E picked up the CBS drama &quot;Unforgettable&quot; for a fourth season as well as the second season of docuseries &quot;Married at First Sight&quot;, which will move from sister network FYI. The network also announced the revival of &quot;Intervention&quot; following its cancellation in 2013.

In October 2016, A&amp;E premiered &quot;Live PD&quot;, a live series that followed U.S. police departments on patrol in real-time. The show would quickly garner commercial success; in 2018, a survey by Inscape found &quot;Live PD&quot; to be the most-watched program among non-live (DVR and VOD) and over-the-top viewers in 2018. &quot;Live PD&quot; was among the most-watched programs on cable television during its run and was credited for allowing A&amp;E to reverse the trend of systematic viewership declines seen across cable television networks.

On January 19, 2017, A&amp;E announced a reboot of &quot;Cold Case Files&quot;, over a decade after its final season premiered in 2006. A revival of the &quot;Biography&quot; franchise would also launch on June 28, 2017, with &quot;The Notorious Life of Biggie Smalls&quot;.

In June 2020, &quot;Live PD&quot; was cancelled by the network in the wake of the 2020 race riots and after reports were confirmed that the show&#x27;s producers had recorded and then deleted footage of the killing of Javier Ambler under police custody. The footage was erased after the Austin Police Department conducted an investigation using the body cam footage they had from the officers. While defending the show in a statement, Dan Abrams said, &quot;Contrary to many incorrect reports, neither A&amp;E nor the producers of &#x27;Live PD&#x27; were asked for the footage or an interview by investigators from law enforcement or the District Attorney&#x27;s office.&quot; A&amp;E over-reliance on the series to fill its schedule resulted in the network losing half of its audience; up until that point, A&amp;E&#x27;s primetime viewership had been up by 4% year-over-year.

In 2021, A&amp;E began a partnership with the professional wrestling promotion WWE to develop original content chronicling the company&#x27;s history and performers, including eight episodes of &quot;Biography&quot; focusing on WWE figures, and &quot;WWE&#x27;s Most Wanted Treasures&quot;—a series following Stephanie McMahon and Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque in their search of wrestling memorabilia. &quot;Most Wanted Treasures&quot; was A&amp;E&#x27;s most-watched new series in 2021, while the premiere of a &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Stone Cold Steve Austin attracted the franchise&#x27;s highest viewership in 16 years. In 2022, WWE and A&amp;E announced a 24-episode renewal for &quot;Most Wanted Treasures&quot;, an additional 35 &quot;Biography: WWE Legends&quot; episodes, and the new series &quot;WWE Rivals&quot;. &quot;Rivals&quot; was renewed for a second season that premiered in February 2023, alongside the third season of &quot;Biography: WWE Legends&quot;. In December 2024, WWE announced a new reality series—&quot;WWE LFG&quot;—to premiere in 2025, as well as the new documentary series &quot;WWE&#x27;s Greatest Moments&quot; and renewals for &quot;WWE Rivals&quot;.

==Programming==

Notable original series seen on A&amp;E have included &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Breakfast with the Arts&quot;, &quot;The First 48&quot;, &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot;, &quot;Live PD&quot;, &quot;Storage Wars&quot;, and &quot;Wahlburgers&quot;.

==Criticism and controversy==
=== &quot;Secrets of Playboy&quot; ===
Beginning in January 2022, A&amp;E broadcast a 12-part series entitled &quot;Secrets of Playboy.&quot; This included allegations that Hugh Hefner himself had committed rape and sexual assault. The show also included claims that other men in the Playboy orbit, such as Bill Cosby, had committed rape. One of the women coming forward was Sondra Theodore, Hefner&#x27;s girlfriend in the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s. She stated that many people in fact believed the reports and accusations, but tended to blame the women anyway because of the reputation of the Playboy Mansion, even though Playboy tried to put forward a healthy &quot;Girl Next Door&quot; attitude. This A&amp;E series also include claims by Dr. Mark Saginor&#x27;s estranged daughter, by Theodore, and by former butler Mitch Rosen that the doctor was not only Hefner&#x27;s live-in physician, but also his male lover. Dr. Saginor said this was not the case.

Some Playboy employees signed a statement which read: “ . . Our time within Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy and the organization&#x27;s subsidiaries remains a period all of us are fond of. I proudly sign this letter in recognition of Hugh Hefner&#x27;s character amid unfounded allegations in the A&amp;E show.” In response, A&amp;E issued a statement which read: “The stories shared in Secrets of Playboy are the personal experiences of the documentary&#x27;s participants and deserve to be told despite how difficult they may be for some to hear. Signatures on a letter, or a different experience with Mr. Hefner or the Playboy culture, do not negate the experiences of those who have come forward . . ”

=== &quot;Longmire&quot; ===
The 2014 cancellation of &quot;Longmire&quot; drew viewer backlash over the network citing that the show skewed an older audience as one of the reasons. The series was later picked up by Netflix.

=== &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; ===
On December 19, 2013, A&amp;E attempted to place Phil Robertson from &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; on an indefinite hiatus following remarks on homosexuals in an interview with &quot;GQ&quot;. A&amp;E said in a statement, &quot;We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson&#x27;s comments in &quot;GQ&quot;, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot;. His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.&quot; On December 27, 2013, A&amp;E announced they would begin filming again with the entire Robertson family after an outcry from show viewers and discussions with the Robertson family and numerous advocacy groups, a decision which itself resulted in more criticism of the network for refusing to stand by its original statement.

=== &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; ===
Earlier, A&amp;E had been criticized for extreme channel drift from its original focus on the fine arts. For example, Maury Chaykin reflected on the cancellation of the A&amp;E original series &quot;A Nero Wolfe Mystery&quot; in a 2008 interview: &quot;I&#x27;m a bit jaded and cynical about which shows succeed on television. I worked on a fantastic show once called &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, but at the time A&amp;E was transforming from the premiere intellectual cable network in America to one that airs &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot; on repeat, so it was never promoted and eventually went off the air.&quot;

<text>Jämsänkoski is a former town and municipality of Finland in the Central Finland region. It is located near Lake Päijänne and the Jämsänjoki river. The town had a population of 7,351 in 2008. It covered an area of 448.67 km² of which 48.02 km² is water. The population density was 16.9 inhabitants per km².

The municipality of Koskenpää was consolidated with Jämsänkoski in 1969, while Jämsänkoski was consolidated with Jämsä in 2009.

== History ==
Linnasenmäki, the remains of an Iron Age hillfort, are located in the southern part of Jämsänkoski near the paper mill. The area may have had Stone Age settlement as well.
Jämsänkoski was originally only the name of the rapids in the Jämsänjoki river. The area was originally a part of the Jämsä parish.

A sawmill has existed by the rapids since the 1790s. Paper production started in 1888, when Elieser Johansson and Per Benjamin Köhlin established a cellulose factory in the area. The settlement of Jämsänkoski grew around the factories. Jämsänkoski got its own parish in 1925 and became a separate municipality in 1926. The Jämsänkoski church was built in 1935.

The municipality of Koskenpää was consolidated with Jämsänkoski in 1969. Jämsänkoski became a town in 1986. In 2009, Jämsänkoski became a part of Jämsä once again.

== Economy ==
The paper mill owned by UPM Kymmene is the largest employer of Jämsänkoski.

<text>The  (German for &quot;Brockhaus Encyclopedia&quot;) is a German-language encyclopedia which until 2009 was published by the F. A. Brockhaus printing house.

The first edition originated in the &quot;Conversations-Lexikon&quot; published by Renatus Gotthelf Löbel and Franke in Leipzig 1796–1808. Renamed &quot;Der Große Brockhaus&quot; in 1928 and from 1966, the 21st thirty-volume edition contains about 300,000 entries on about 24,000 pages, with about 40,000 maps, graphics and tables. It is the largest German-language printed encyclopedia in the 21st century.

In February 2008, F. A. Brockhaus announced the changeover to an online encyclopedia and the discontinuation of the printed editions. The rights to the &quot;Brockhaus&quot; trademark were purchased by Arvato services, a subsidiary of the Bertelsmann media group. After more than 200 years, the distribution of the Brockhaus encyclopedia ceased completely in 2014.

== History ==

Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, the scope of the original &quot; was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort to become comprehensive. Published by the Leipzig scholars Renatus Gotthelf Löbel (1767–1799) and Christian Wilhelm Franke (1765–1831) from 1796 onward, it included geography, history, and in part biography, as well as the more typical mythology, philosophy, natural history, etc.

Upon Löbel&#x27;s death in 1799, Franke sold the rights to publication to Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus (1772–1823). The deal was made at the Leipzig Book Fair on 25 October 1808 for the price of 1,800 thalers.

In 1984, &#x27; merged with the &#x27; (BIM). After the merger, it was decided that former &quot; serial reference works such as would henceforth be marketed under the name of .

=== Full print editions ===

Thirteen editions were issued during the 19th century. The articles, often very brief, were considered excellent and trustworthy, especially on German subjects, gave references to the best books, and included biographies of living men.

At first the name of the encyclopedia remained &quot;Konversationslexikon&quot; or &quot;Allgemeine deutsche Real-Encyklopädie für die gebildeten Stände&quot; (&quot;General German encyclopedia for the educated&quot;); only with the 13th edition did the name Brockhaus appear in the title, and the last edition is titled .

Christian Wilhelm Franke was to finish vol. vi of the Leipzig publication by December 1808, and the already projected supplement, in 2 volumes, by 1811. Brockhaus himself edited the 2nd edition (1812–1819, 10 vols.), and, when vol. IV was published, the 3rd (1814–1819). Ludwig Ham assisted in editing the 4th and 5th editions until he left Leipzig in April 1820, when Professor F.C. Hasse took his place. Brockhaus died in 1823, and his two eldest sons, Friedrich and Heinrich, edited the 6th edition with Hasse&#x27;s assistance in September 1823. Hasse edited the 7th edition. Karl August Espe edited the 8th and 9th editions.

August Kurtzel, aided by Oskar Pilz, edited the 10th edition, assisted by , and Heinrich Rudolf Brockhaus , the younger son, assisted in the 11th edition. Kurtzel died on April 24, 1871, and Pilz was sole editor until March 1872, when Gustav Stockmann joined, who was alone from April until joined by Karl Wippermann in October.

The 14th edition was published in 1894, featuring 18,842 pages in 16 regular volumes and one supplement volume.

Preparations for the 15th edition were disrupted by World War I, and recommenced in 1925. Because its 20 volumes (15,800 pages) were published from 1928–1934 which covered the period of the Weimar Republic, this edition is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Weimar Brockhaus.&quot; A supplement volume was published in 1935.

The 16th edition, published 1952–1957, consisted of 12 regular volumes, two supplement volumes, and one atlas volume.

The latest (2005–2006) full print version of the is the 21st edition, with approx. 24,500 pages in 30 volumes. Prices start at EUR 2,820.

=== Abbreviated print editions ===

In addition to the full encyclopedia, several abbreviated editions have been published with increasingly condensed content:
* The 1854 &quot;Kleineres Brockhaus&#x27;sches Conversations-Lexikon für den Hausgebrauch&quot; (&quot;Minor Brockhaus Encyclopedia for Home Use&quot;) had 4 volumes;
* The &quot;Brockhaus&#x27; Kleines Konversations-Lexikon&quot; (&quot;Brockhaus Small Encyclopedia&quot;), multiple editions, was published in two volumes;
* &quot;Der Volks-Brockhaus&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s Brockhaus&quot;), the first single-volume version, was first published in 1931. By 1941, it was in its 9th edition, with 794 pages. The 15th edition, expanded to 1040 pages, was published in 1975.

=== Transition to digital editions ===

A digital multimedia encyclopedia based on the is available under the name &quot;Brockhaus Multimedial Premium&quot;, which is similar to Microsoft Encarta.

On February 13, 2008, Brockhaus announced that due to the disappointing sales figures, it would make the content of the encyclopedia available online, supported by Internet advertising revenues and that there might be no more print editions. This announcement briefly boosted print sales again and the plans to switch to an on-line only edition were canceled. However, in 2009 Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus AG (Bifab) sold the Brockhaus brand to Bertelsmann, renamed themselves to Bibliographisches Institut AG, and sacked 50 employees of its Leipzig-based editorial staff. This move was widely interpreted as the end of , caused by the competition of Internet-based reference works such as Wikipedia.

==Impact==
&quot;No work of reference has been more useful and successful, or more frequently copied, imitated and translated, than that known as the &quot;Conversations-Lexikon&quot; of Brockhaus,&quot; wrote the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition. The work was intended not for scientific use, but to promote general intellectual improvement by giving the results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extended details. This format, a contrast to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in several countries. The seventh edition of the &quot;Conversations-Lexikon&quot; formed the basis of the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; (1829–1833), the first significant American encyclopedia. Other encyclopedias modelled on &quot;Brockhaus&quot; included the Dutch &quot;Winkler Prins Geïllustreerde Encyclopaedie&quot; (1870–1882) and the Russian &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot; (1890–1906).

In 2009, &quot;Brockhaus&quot; had a brand recognition of 93% in Germany.

<doc id="472535" wikidata="Q6671126" url="?curid=472535" title="2000 London mayoral election">
<text>The 2000 London mayoral election was held on 4 May 2000 to elect the Mayor of London. It was the first election to the office established that year; the idea of a mayor of a Greater London Authority (GLA) had been included in Labour&#x27;s 1997 election manifesto, and after their election a referendum in London was scheduled for May 1998, in which there was a 72% yes vote with a 34% turnout.

==Electoral system==
The election used a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference for candidates. 
* If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, that candidate wins
* If no candidate receives more than 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated
* The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count
* Voters&#x27; ballots whose first and second preference candidates have both been eliminated are discarded
* Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is one of the top two have their second preference votes added to that candidate&#x27;s count
This means that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of voters who expressed a preference among the top two.

==Candidates==
* Geoffrey Ben-Nathan stood as a PRO-MaSS (Pro-motorist and Small Shop) candidate, campaigning on a platform of stopping the use of motorists as &quot;wallets on wheels&quot;.
* Geoffrey Clements ran for the Natural Law Party, of which he was the leader. A doctor of physics from the University of Sussex, he also trained as a teacher in the techniques of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
* Frank Dobson (born 15 March 1940), the Labour Party candidate, was the MP for Holborn and St. Pancras and Secretary of State for Health.
* Ram Gidoomal, a businessman and author originally from British East Africa ran for the Christian Peoples Alliance.
* Damian Hockney was a leading member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He has since been a member of Veritas and the leader of One London.
* Darren Johnson (born 1966) was a leading member of the Green Party of England and Wales who was elected to the London Assembly in 2000.
* Susan Kramer (born 22 July 1950) was the candidate for the Liberal Democrats. She was later elected MP for Richmond Park and is now a life peer.
* Ken Livingstone (born 17 June 1945) had been leader of the Greater London Council and MP for Brent East, both for the Labour Party.
* Michael Newland was the candidate for the British National Party, at the time serving as the party&#x27;s national treasurer. Previously associated with the National Front he subsequently joined the Freedom Party.
* Steven Norris (born 24 May 1945) had served the Conservative Party as MP for Oxford East and Epping Forest.
* Ashwinkumar Tanna, who had been a candidate for UKIP in the 2000 Tottenham by-election, ran on an independent ticket with a range of policies including opposing privatisation of London Underground, local involvement in policing and the establishment of a citywide business forum.

==Candidate selection==
===Labour===

With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000, Ken Livingstone stated his intention to stand as a potential Labour candidate for the position in March 1998. Tony Blair did not want Livingstone as London Mayor, claiming the latter was one of those who &quot;almost knocked [the party] over the edge of the cliff into extinction&quot; during the 1980s. He and the Labour spin doctors organised a campaign against Livingstone to ensure that he was not selected, with Alastair Campbell and Sally Morgan unsuccessfully attempting to get Oona King to denounce Livingstone. They failed to convince Mo Mowlam to stand for the mayorship, and instead encouraged the reluctant Frank Dobson to stand. Recognising that a &#x27;one member, one vote&#x27; election within the London Labour Party would probably see Livingstone selected over Dobson, Blair ensured that a third of the votes would come from the rank-and-file members, a third from the trades unions, and a third from Labour MPs and MEPs, the latter two of which he could pressure into voting for his own preferred candidate, something that Dobson was deeply uncomfortable with.

Information on the Blairite campaign against Livingstone became public, costing Dobson much support; nevertheless, while Livingstone won amongst party members (60% to Dobson&#x27;s 40%) and among affiliated unions (72% to Dobson&#x27;s 28%, a more than 2:1 vote), Dobson&#x27;s landslide victory (173:27 in ratio) amongst MPs, MEPS and GLA candidates saw him win narrowly overall: forming a simple electoral college outcome of 51.5% to 48.5%. Livingstone proclaimed Dobson to be &quot;a tainted candidate&quot; and stated his intention to run for the Mayoralty as an independent candidate. Aware that this would result in his expulsion from Labour, he publicly stated that &quot;I have been forced to choose between the party I love and upholding the democratic rights of Londoners.&quot; 

===Conservatives===
Steve Norris had lost the original selection ballot for Conservative candidate to Jeffrey Archer, but Archer stood down as a candidate when a newspaper printed a story accusing him of committing perjury during a 1987 libel trial (he was later convicted and imprisoned).

==Results==








*Turnout: 1,752,303 (34.43%)
*As the ballot papers are counted electronically, totals for all second preferences are available, even though some did not contribute to the final result.

<doc id="472537" wikidata="Q1426491" url="?curid=472537" title="Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura">
<text>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a blood disorder that results in blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. This results in a low platelet count, low red blood cells due to their breakdown, and often kidney, heart, and brain dysfunction. Symptoms may include large bruises, fever, weakness, shortness of breath, confusion, and headache. Repeated episodes may occur.

In about half of cases a trigger is identified, while in the remainder the cause remains unknown. Known triggers include bacterial infections, certain medications, autoimmune diseases such as lupus, and pregnancy. The underlying mechanism typically involves antibodies inhibiting the enzyme ADAMTS13. This results in decreased break down of large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. Less commonly TTP is inherited, known as Upshaw–Schulman syndrome, such that ADAMTS13 dysfunction is present from birth. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and blood tests. It may be supported by measuring activity of or antibodies against ADAMTS13.

With plasma exchange the risk of death has decreased from more than 90% to less than 20%. Immunosuppressants, such as glucocorticoids, and rituximab may also be used. Platelet transfusions are generally not recommended.

About 1 per 100,000 people are affected. Onset is typically in adulthood and women are more often affected. About 10% of cases begin in childhood. The condition was first described by Eli Moschcowitz in 1924. The underlying mechanism was determined in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of TTP may at first be subtle and nonspecific. Many people experience an influenza-like or diarrheal illness before developing TTP. Neurological symptoms are very common and vary greatly in severity. Frequently reported symptoms include feeling very tired, confusion, and headaches. Seizures and symptoms similar to those of a stroke can also be seen. Other symptoms include, but are not limited to jaundice or paleness of the skin, a fast heart rate or shortness of breath, or dots on the skin known as petechiae. High blood pressure has also been observed as a symptom.

As TTP progresses, blood clots form within small blood vessels (microvasculature), and platelets (clotting cells) are consumed. As a result, bruising, and rarely bleeding can occur. The bruising often takes the form of purpura, while the most common site of bleeding, if it occurs, is from the nose or gums. Larger bruises (ecchymoses) may also develop. The classic presentation of TTP, which occurs in less than 10% of people, includes five medical signs. These are:
* Fever
* Changes in mental status
* Thrombocytopenia
* Reduced kidney function
* Hemolytic anemia (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia).

==Causes==
TTP, as with other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (MAHAs), is caused by spontaneous aggregation of platelets and activation of coagulation in the small blood vessels. Platelets are consumed in the aggregation process and bind vWF. These platelet-vWF complexes form small blood clots which circulate in the blood vessels and cause shearing of red blood cells, resulting in their rupture and formation of schistocytes. The two best understood causes of TTP are due to autoimmunity (acquired TTP), caused by autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS13, or congenital TTP: an inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13 (known as the Upshaw–Schulman syndrome).

===Autoimmune===
In 1998, the majority of cases were shown to be caused by the inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13 by antibodies. Knowledge of this relationship between reduced ADAMTS13 and the pathogenesis of TTP is credited to two independent groups of researchers (Furlan and Tsai) who published their research in the same issue of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

ADAMTS13 is a metalloproteinase responsible for the breakdown of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein that links platelets, blood clots, and the blood vessel wall in the process of blood coagulation. Very large vWF multimers are more prone to lead to coagulation. Hence, without proper cleavage of vWF by ADAMTS13, coagulation occurs at a higher rate, especially in the microvasculature, part of the blood vessel system where vWF is most active due to high shear stress.

===Genetic===

TTP may also be congenital. Such cases may be caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. This hereditary form of TTP is called Upshaw–Schulman syndrome (also spelled Upshaw–Schülman). People with this inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency have a surprisingly mild phenotype, but develop TTP in clinical situations with increased von Willebrand factor levels (e.g. infection). Reportedly, less than 5% of all TTP cases are due to Upshaw–Schulman syndrome. People with this syndrome generally have 5–10% of normal ADAMTS-13 activity.

A 2024 study suggested that hereditary TTP is underdiagnosed and should be considered in cases of unexplained stroke, neonatal jaundice, and severe pre-eclampsia. The study estimated the global prevalence of hereditary TTP at 40 per million, in contrast to previously reported estimates of 0.5 to 2.0 per million.

===Secondary===

Secondary TTP is diagnosed when the person&#x27;s history mentions one of the known features associated with TTP. It comprises about 40% of all cases of TTP. Predisposing factors are:
* Cancer
* Bone marrow transplantation
* Pregnancy
* Medication use:
** Antiviral drugs (acyclovir)
** Certain chemotherapy medications such as gemcitabine and mitomycin C
** Quinine
** Oxymorphone
** Quetiapine
** Bevacizumab
** Sunitinib
** Platelet aggregation inhibitors (ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel)
** Immunosuppressants (ciclosporin, mitomycin, tacrolimus/FK506, interferon-α)
** Hormone altering drugs (estrogens, contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy)
* HIV-1 infection

The mechanism of secondary TTP is poorly understood, as ADAMTS13 activity is generally not as depressed as in idiopathic TTP, and inhibitors cannot be detected. Probable etiology may involve, at least in some cases, endothelial damage, although the formation of thrombi resulting in vessel occlusion may not be essential in the pathogenesis of secondary TTP. These factors may also be considered a form of secondary aHUS; people presenting with these features are, therefore, potential candidates for anticomplement therapy.

==Pathophysiology==
The underlying mechanism typically involves autoantibody-mediated inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) into smaller units. The increase in circulating multimers of vWF increases platelet adhesion to areas of endothelial injury, particularly where arterioles and capillaries meet, which in turn results in the formation of small platelet clots called thrombi. As platelets are used up in the formation of thrombi, this then leads to a decrease in the number of overall circulating platelets, which may then cause life-threatening bleeds. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress, which damages their membranes, leading to rupture of red blood cells within blood vessels, which in turn leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and schistocyte formation. The presence of the thrombi reduces blood flow to organs resulting in cellular injury and end organ damage.

=== Recovery ===
Depression is common in those recovering from TTP; 59% of recovered TTP patients screened positive for depression within 11 years after recovery.

==Diagnosis==
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) initially presents with a range of symptoms that may include severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count usually &lt; 30,000/mm³), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes in the blood smear), and various clinical signs such as petechiae, purpura, neurologic symptoms, myocardial ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, and renal abnormalities. Notably, the complete classic pentad of TTP symptoms—microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal abnormalities, fever, and neurologic abnormalities—is only seen in about 10% of acute cases at initial presentation. Clinical suspicion of TTP is often established with an initial emergent presentation of one or more classic symptoms and a complete blood count revealing severe thrombocytopenia. 

The PLASMIC score, Bentley score, and French TMA score have been used to assess clinical probability of TTP.

A definitive diagnosis of TTP may be established when a laboratory assay of ADAMTS13 identifies under 10% of normal enzyme function. Borderline or normal ADAMTS13 activity suggests a different diagnosis is more likely. 

The ISTH guidelines suggested diagnostic and early management strategy. Suggestions included 1) for high pretest probability based on PLASMIC score or French score, start TPE and corticosteroids, and collect plasma samples for ADAMTS13 testing before therapy. Consider caplacizumab if ADAMTS13 test results are expected within 72 hours. If ADAMTS13 &lt;10 IU/dL, continue caplacizumab and rituximab. If ADAMTS13 is ≥20 IU/dL, consider to stop caplacizumab and seek other diagnoses. If ADAMTS13 activity is borderline, use clinical judgment; 2) for low or intermediate pretest probability, still consider TPE and corticosteroids, but withhold caplacizumab until plasma ADAMTS13 test results are available; if ADAMTS13 activity is &lt;10 IU/dL, consider adding caplacizumab and rituximab; if ADAMTS13 activity is ≥20 IU/dL, no caplacizumab should be used and other diagnoses should be sought; if ADAMTS13 activity falls borderline, consider other diagnoses.

===Differential diagnosis===
TTP is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. This characteristic is shared by two related syndromes, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Consequently, differential diagnosis of these TMA diseases is essential. Both TTP and HUS are characterized by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms. Generally, TTP has higher rates of neurological symptoms (≤80%) and lower rates of renal symptoms (9%) than HUS (10–20% and 90%, respectively).

Unlike HUS and aHUS, TTP is known to be caused by a defect in the ADAMTS13 protein, so a lab test showing ≤5% of normal ADAMTS13 levels is indicative of TTP. ADAMTS13 levels above 5%, coupled with a positive test for shiga-toxin/enterohemorrhagic &quot;E. coli&quot; (EHEC), are more likely indicative of HUS, whereas absence of shiga-toxin/EHEC can confirm a diagnosis of aHUS.

==Treatment==
Due to the high mortality of untreated TTP, a presumptive diagnosis of TTP is made even when only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are seen, and therapy is started. Transfusion is contraindicated in thrombotic TTP, as it fuels the coagulopathy. Since the early 1990s, plasmapheresis has become the treatment of choice for TTP. This is an exchange transfusion involving removal of the person&#x27;s blood plasma through apheresis and replacement with donor plasma (fresh frozen plasma or cryosupernatant); the procedure must be repeated daily to eliminate the inhibitor and abate the symptoms. If apheresis is not available, fresh frozen plasma can be infused, but the volume that can be given safely is limited due to the danger of fluid overload. Plasma infusion alone is not as beneficial as plasma exchange. Corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) are usually given. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody aimed at the CD20 molecule on B lymphocytes, may be used on diagnosis; this is thought to kill the B cells and thereby reduce the production of the inhibitor. A stronger recommendation for rituximab exists where TTP does not respond to corticosteroids and plasmapheresis.

Caplacizumab is an adjunct option in treating TTP as it has been shown that it induces a faster disease resolution compared with those people who were on placebo. However, the use of caplacizumab was associated with increase bleeding tendencies in some studied subjects. Its cost-effectiveness has also been questioned. Use of caplacizumab without plasmapheresis has been reported in select patients. The MAYARI study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this option.
The ISTH guidelines recommended for first acute episode and relapses of immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), add corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and consider adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, consider rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic congenital TTP, offer prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and consider plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.

People with refractory or relapsing TTP may receive additional immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. vincristine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, or splenectomy.

Children with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome receive prophylactic plasma every two to three weeks; this maintains adequate levels of functioning ADAMTS13. Some tolerate longer intervals between plasma infusions. Additional plasma infusions may be necessary for triggering events, such as surgery; alternatively, the platelet count may be monitored closely around these events with plasma being administered if the count drops.

Measurements of blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase, platelets, and schistocytes are used to monitor disease progression or remission. ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor levels may be measured during follow-up, but in those without symptoms the use of rituximab is not recommended.

Apadamtase alfa (Adzynma) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2023. The use of ADAMTS13 is well established for the treatment of congenital TTP.

==Prognosis==
The mortality rate is around 95% for untreated cases, but the prognosis is reasonably favorable (80–90% survival) for people with idiopathic TTP diagnosed and treated early with plasmapheresis.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of TTP is about 4–5 cases per million people per year. Idiopathic TTP occurs more often in women as well as people of African descent, and TTP secondary to autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus occurs more frequently in people of African descent, although other secondary forms do not show this distribution. Although Black people are at an increased risk for TTP, its presentation in Black people does not have any distinguishable features compared to those of other races. Pregnant women and women in the &quot;post partum&quot; period accounted for a notable portion (12–31%) of the cases in some studies; TTP affects about one in 25,000 pregnancies.

==History==
TTP was initially described by Eli Moschcowitz at the Beth Israel Hospital in New York City in 1924. Moschcowitz ascribed the disease (incorrectly, as now known) to a toxic cause. Moschcowitz noted his patient, a 16-year-old girl, had anemia, small and large bruises, microscopic hematuria, and, at autopsy, disseminated microvascular thrombi. In 1966, a review of 16 new cases and 255 previously reported cases led to the formulation of the classical pentad of symptoms and findings (i.e., thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, kidney failure, fever); in this series, mortality rates were found to be very high (90%).

While a response to blood transfusion had been noted before, a 1978 report and subsequent studies showed blood plasma was highly effective in improving the disease process. In 1991, plasma exchange was reported to provide better response rates compared to plasma infusion. In 1982, the disease had been linked with abnormally large von Willebrand factor multimers. The identification of a deficient protease in people with TTP was made in 1998. The location of ADAMTS13 within the human genome was identified in 2001.

<doc id="472539" wikidata="Q344955" url="?curid=472539" title="Richard Condon">
<text>Richard Thomas Condon (March 18, 1915 – April 9, 1996) was an American political novelist. Though his works were satire, they were generally transformed into thrillers or semi-thrillers in other media, such as cinema. All 26 books were written in distinctive Condon style, which combined a fast pace, outrage, and frequent humor while focusing almost obsessively on monetary greed and political corruption. Condon himself once said: &quot;Every book I&#x27;ve ever written has been about abuse of power. I feel very strongly about that. I&#x27;d like people to know how deeply their politicians wrong them.&quot; Condon&#x27;s books were occasionally bestsellers, and a number of his books were made into films; he is primarily remembered for his 1959 &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and, many years later, a series of four novels about a family of New York gangsters named Prizzi.

Condon&#x27;s writing was known for its complex plotting, fascination with trivia, and loathing for those in power; at least two of his books featured thinly disguised versions of Richard Nixon. His characters tend to be driven by obsession, usually sexual or political, and family loyalty. His plots often have elements of classical tragedy, with protagonists whose pride leads them to destroy what they love. Some of his books, most notably &quot;Mile High&quot; (1969), are perhaps best described as secret history. &quot;And Then We Moved to Rossenarra&quot; is a humorous autobiographical recounting of various places in the world where he had lived and his family&#x27;s 1970s move to Rossenarra, County Kilkenny, Ireland.

== Early life ==
Born in New York City, Condon attended DeWitt Clinton High School.

After service in the United States Merchant Marine, Condon achieved moderate success as a Hollywood publicist, ad writer and Hollywood agent. Condon turned to writing in 1957. Employed by United Artists as an ad writer, he complained that he was wasting time in Hollywood and wanted to write a novel. Without Condon&#x27;s knowledge, his boss, Max E. Youngstein, deducted money from his salary, then fired him after a year, returning the amount of money he had deducted in the form of a Mexican bank account and the key to a house overlooking the ocean in Mexico. Youngstein told him to write his book. His second novel, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1959), featured a dedication to Youngstein and was made into a successful film.

==Basic themes==

In &quot;Mile High&quot;, his eighth novel, one primarily about how a single spectacularly ruthless gangster named Eddie West imposes Prohibition upon an unwary populace, Condon sums up the theme of all his books in a single angry &quot;cri de coeur&quot;:
Prohibition fused the amateurism and catch-as-catch-can national tendencies of the early days of the republic with a more modern, highly organized lust for violence and the quick buck. It fused the need to massacre twelve hundred thousand American Indians and ten million American buffalo, the lynching bees, the draft riots, bread riots, gold riots and race riots, the constant wars, the largest rats in the biggest slums, boxing and football, the loudest music, the most strident and exploitative press with the entire wonderful promise of tomorrow and tomorrow, always dragging the great nation downward into greater violence and more unnecessary deaths, into newer and more positive celebration of nonlife, all so that the savage, simple-minded people might be educated into greater frenzies of understanding that power and money are the only desirable objects for this life.

==&quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot;==

Although not perhaps actually originated by Condon himself, his use of &quot;the Manchurian Candidate&quot; made that phrase a part of the English language. Frank Rich, for example, in his column in the &quot;Sunday Opinion&quot; of &quot;The New York Times&quot; of August 17, 2008, writes about Barack Obama with a reference to both a well-known actress and a well-known plot element (which he gets wrong) in the first movie version of Condon&#x27;s 1959 book:

[Obama&#x27;s] been done in by that ad with Britney [Spears] and Paris [Hilton] and a new international crisis that allows [John] McCain to again flex his Manchurian Candidate military cred. Let the neocons identify a new battleground for igniting World War III... and McCain gets with the program as if Angela Lansbury has just dealt him the Queen of Hearts. 

==&quot;The fiction of information&quot;==

Condon&#x27;s works are difficult to categorize precisely: A 1971 &quot;Time&quot; magazine review declared that, &quot;Condon was never a satirist: he was a riot in a satire factory. He raged at Western civilization and every last one of its works. He decorticated the Third Reich, cheese fanciers, gossip columnists and the Hollywood star system with equal and total frenzy.&quot; The headline of his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him a &quot;political novelist&quot;, but went on to say that, &quot;Novelist is too limited a word to encompass the world of Mr. Condon. He was also a visionary, a darkly comic conjurer, a student of American mythology and a master of conspiracy theories, as vividly demonstrated in &#x27;The Manchurian Candidate&#x27;.&quot; Although his books combined many different elements, including occasional outright fantasy and science fiction, they were, above all, written to entertain the general public. He had, however, a genuine disdain, outrage, and even hatred for many of the mainstream political corruptions that he found so prevalent in American life. In a 1977 quotation, he said that:

...people are being manipulated, exploited, murdered by their servants, who have convinced these savage, simple-minded populations that they are their masters, and that it hurts the head, if one thinks. People accept servants as masters. My novels are merely entertaining persuasions to get the people to think in other categories.

With his long lists of absurd trivia and &quot;mania for absolute details&quot;, Condon was, along with Ian Fleming, one of the early exemplars of those called by Pete Hamill in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, &quot;the practitioners of what might be called the New Novelism... Condon applies a dense web of facts to fiction... There might really be two kinds of fiction: the fiction of sensibility and the fiction of information... As a practitioner of the fiction of information, no one else comes close to him.&quot;

==Quirks and characteristics==

Condon attacked his targets wholeheartedly but with a uniquely original style and wit that made almost any paragraph from one of his books instantly recognizable. Reviewing one of his works in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, playwright George Axelrod (&quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter&quot;), who had collaborated with Condon on the screenplay for the film adaptation of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, wrote:
The arrival of a new novel by Richard Condon is like an invitation to a party... the sheer gusto of the prose, the madness of his similes, the lunacy of his metaphors, his infectious, almost child-like joy in composing complex sentences that go bang at the end in the manner of exploding cigars is both exhilarating and as exhausting as any good party ought to be.

===Metaphors and similes===
From his 1975 novel, &quot;Money Is Love&quot;, comes a fine example of the &quot;lunacy of his metaphors&quot;: &quot;Mason took in enough cannabis smoke to allow a Lipan Apache manipulating a blanket over it to transmit the complete works of Tennyson.&quot;

&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; offers:
The effects of the narcotics, techniques, and suggestions... achieved a result that approximated the impact an entire twenty-five-cent jar of F. W. Woolworth vanishing cream might have on vanishing an aircraft carrier of the &quot;Forrestal&quot; class when rubbed into the armor plate.

===Lists and trivia===
Condon was also enamored of long lists of detailed trivia that, while at least marginally pertinent to the subject at hand, are almost always an exercise in gleeful exaggeration and joyful spirits. In &quot;An Infinity of Mirrors,&quot; for instance, those in attendance of the funeral of a famous French actor and notable lover are delineated as:

Seven ballerinas of an amazing spectrum of ages were at graveside. Actresses of films, opera, music halls, the theatre, radio, carnivals, circuses, pantomimes, and lewd exhibitions mourned in the front line. There were also society leaders, lady scientists, women politicians, mannequins, couturières, Salvation Army lassies, all but one of his wives, a lady wrestler, a lady matador, twenty-three lady painters, four lady sculptors, a car-wash attendant, shopgirls, shoplifters, shoppers, and the shopped; a zoo assistant, two choir girls, a Métro attendant from the terminal at the Bois de Vincennes, four beauty-contest winners, a chambermaid; the mothers of children, the mothers of men, the grandmothers of children and the grandmothers of men; and the general less specialized, female public-at-large which had come from eleven European countries, women perhaps whom he had only pinched or kissed absent-mindedly while passing through his busy life. They attended twenty-eight hundred and seventy strong, plus eleven male friends of the deceased.

Writing about &quot;The Whisper of the Axe&quot; in the daily book review column of Friday, May 21, 1976, in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Richard R. Lingeman praised the book in particular and Condon in general for the &quot;extravagance of invention unique with him.&quot;

Not everyone was as exhilarated by Condon&#x27;s antics, however. In a long &quot;Times&quot; Sunday review just two days after Lingeman&#x27;s, Roger Sale excoriated Condon as a writer of &quot;how-to books&quot; in general, this book in particular, and Condon&#x27;s habit of using lists: &quot;A lot of it is done with numbers arbitrarily chosen to falsely simulate precision.&quot;

===Real-life names in his books===

All of Condon&#x27;s books have, to an unknown degree, the names of real people in them as characters, generally very minor or peripheral. The most common, which appears in all of his books, is some variation of Franklin M. Heller. Among them are F.M. Heller, Frank Heller, Franz Heller, Marxie Heller, and F. Marx Heller. The real-life Heller was a television director in New York City in the 1950s, &#x27;60s, and 70s, who initially lived on Long Island and then moved to a house on Rockrimmon Road in Stamford, Connecticut. Beginning with &quot;Mile High&quot; in 1969, mentions of a Rockrimmon Road or Rockrimmon House also began to appear regularly in the novels. Late in life Heller grew a thick white beard and became a devotee of needlework—both traits that the fictional Hellers shared, sometimes to ludicrous effect, as when a battle-hardened Admiral Heller is depicted issuing orders while absorbed in needlework. The real-life Heller made one needlework depiction of the manor house in Ireland in which Condon was living at the time. In &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, Marxie Heller is a mobster and murder victim; in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Family&quot;, Franklin Heller is the mayor of New York City; in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Glory&quot;, the Heller Administration is mentioned, implying that he is the president of the United States.

Condon was a great friend of actor Allan Melvin, having written a nightclub act for him. Condon later became a publicist for &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; (&quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot;), on which Melvin played Cpl. Henshaw. Melvin&#x27;s name shows up in several Condon books, most prominently as hitman Al (the Plumber) Melvini in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; (a play on Melvin&#x27;s &quot;Al the Plumber&quot; character in Liquid-Plumr commercials.) In &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, with the exception of Marco, Shaw and Mavole, all of Marco&#x27;s platoon members are named for the cast/crew of &quot;Bilko&quot;: (Nat) Hiken, (Maurice) Gosfield, (Jimmy) Little, (Phil) Silvers, (Allan) Melvin, (Mickey) Freeman and (Harvey) Lembeck.

In &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, a New York City policeman named McCarry is mentioned once; the political thriller writer Charles McCarry was a friend of Condon&#x27;s and, as a former operative of the CIA, was a occasional source of expertise in the field of espionage for Condon.

In a number of books a character named Keifetz appears, named apparently for Norman Keifetz, a New York City author who wrote a novel about a major league baseball player called &quot;The Sensation&quot;—that novel was dedicated to Condon.

A.H. Weiler, a film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was another friend of Condon&#x27;s who made several fictional appearances, usually as Abraham Weiler but sometimes as a Dr. Abe Weiler.

In &quot;The Oldest Confession&quot;, a character has lunch in a Paris bistro and briefly meets two people playing chess at the bar, &quot;Buchwald and Nolan, newspaper and airline peons respectively&quot;. Buchwald is certainly Art Buchwald, the celebrated newspaper columnist and humorist, who, at the time of the book&#x27;s publication, was still working for &quot;The International Herald-Tribune&quot;, which was published in Paris, where Condon had also lived during the 1950s. The identity of Nolan, however, remains a mystery.

==Career in films==

For many years a Hollywood publicity man for Walt Disney and other studios, Condon took up writing relatively late in life and his first novel, &quot;The Oldest Confession&quot;, was not published until he was 43. The demands of his career with United Artists—promoting movies such as &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; and &quot;The King and Four Queens&quot;—led to a series of bleeding ulcers and a determination to do something else.

His next book, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, combined all the elements that defined his works for the next 30 years: nefarious conspiracies, satire, black humor, outrage at political and financial corruption in the American scene, breath-taking elements from thrillers and spy fiction, horrific and grotesque violence, and an obsession with the minutiae of food, drink, and fast living. It quickly made him, for a few years at least, the center of a cult devoted to his works. As he rapidly produced more and more books with the same central themes, however, this following fell away and his critical reputation diminished. Still, over the next three decades Condon produced works that returned him to favor, both with the critics and the book-buying public, such as &quot;Mile High&quot;, &quot;Winter Kills&quot;, and the first of the Prizzi books, &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

Of his numerous books that were turned into Hollywood movies, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was filmed twice. The first version, in 1962, which starred Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury, followed the book with great fidelity, and is now highly regarded as a glimpse into the mindset of its era. Janet Maslin, writing already over two decades ago, said in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1996 that it was &quot;arguably the most chilling piece of cold war paranoia ever committed to film, yet by now it has developed a kind of innocence.&quot;

==&quot;The Keener&#x27;s Manual&quot;==

Beginning with his first book, &quot;The Oldest Confession&quot;, Condon frequently prefaced his novels with excerpts of verse from a so-called &quot;Keener&#x27;s Manual&quot;; these epigraphs foreshadowed the theme of the book or, in several instances, gave the book its title. &quot;The Keener&#x27;s Manual&quot;, however, was a fictional invention by Condon and does not actually exist. A &quot;keen&quot; is a &quot;lamentation for the dead uttered in a loud wailing voice or sometimes in a wordless cry&quot; and a &quot;keener&quot; is a professional mourner, usually a woman in Ireland, who &quot;utters the keen... at a wake or funeral.&quot;

Five of Condon&#x27;s first six books derived their titles from the fictional manual, the only exception being his most famous book, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. The epigraph in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, however, &quot;I am you and you are me /and what have we done to each other?&quot; is a recurring theme in earlier Condon&#x27;s books: in various forms it also appears as dialog in both &quot;The Oldest Confession&quot; and &quot;Some Angry Angel&quot;. Among other epigraphs, the last line of &quot;The riches I bring you /Crowding and shoving, /Are the envy of princes: /A talent for loving.&quot; is the title of Condon&#x27;s fourth novel. His fifth and sixth novels, &quot;An Infinity of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Any God Will Do&quot;, also derive their titles from excerpts of the manual.

Years later, Condon&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Glory&quot; also had an epigraph from the manual, the first one in at least a dozen books.

==Plagiarism charge==

In 1998, a Californian software engineer noticed several paragraphs in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; that appeared nearly identical to portions of the celebrated 1934 novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by the English writer Robert Graves. She wrote about the apparent plagiarism on her website, but her discovery went unnoticed by most of the world until Adair Lara, a longtime &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; staff writer, wrote a lengthy article about the accusation in 2003. Reprinting the paragraphs in question, she also solicited the opinion of a British forensic linguist, who concluded that Condon had unquestionably plagiarized at least two paragraphs of Graves&#x27;s work. By this time, however, more than seven years had passed since Condon&#x27;s death, and Lara&#x27;s article also failed to generate any literary interest outside the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

In &quot;Some Angry Angel&quot;, the book that followed &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, Condon makes a direct reference to Graves. In a long, convoluted passage on page 25, Condon reflects on &quot;mistresses&quot; and their relationship—a peripheral one, to the reader—to Graves&#x27;s writings about &quot;Major Male&quot; Deities and &quot;Major Female&quot; Deities. As &quot;Angel&quot; was published only a year after &quot;Candidate&quot;, there is no question, therefore, about Condon&#x27;s familiarity with the works of Robert Graves.

<doc id="472547" wikidata="Q5667285" url="?curid=472547" title="Harry Bensley">
<text>Harry Bensley (1876 or 1877 – 21 May 1956) was an English rake and adventurer, best remembered as the subject of an extraordinary wager between John Pierpont Morgan and Hugh Cecil Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale. How much of his story is based on fact is unclear.

Bensley was from Thetford in Norfolk, England. In 1904 he was sentenced to four years&#x27; penal servitude for bigamy and fraud: he had married a woman named Lily Chapman in 1903 even though he was already married to his first wife, Kate Green, whom he had married in 1898; he had also been defrauding people by posing as the son of a knight and claiming that he was due to inherit large estates in Norfolk. By 1907 he was a businessman and investor, working particularly in Imperial Russia and reputedly received an income of £5,000 a year.

==The wager==
According to the original tale, one evening in 1907 at the National Sporting Club in London, Morgan and Lonsdale were arguing whether a man could walk around the world without being identified. Bensley, a notorious &quot;playboy&quot; and womaniser with a substantial private income, overheard the conversation and offered to test the proposition on their behalf. The outcome of the exchange was that Lonsdale bet Morgan the then-extravagant sum of £21,000 (worth approximately £2.6 million in 2021) that Bensley would complete a pedestrian circumnavigation incognito.

According to Ken McNaught, grandson of Bensley&#x27;s son Jim Beasley, this is not entirely accurate. Bensley had gambled heavily with the two men, put up all his fortune in a game and lost. Now effectively destitute, he pleaded with the others to accept some way to forfeit. The two gentlemen came up with the unlikely wager.

Bensley had to satisfy 15 conditions, including:
* He was never to be identified;
* He was to walk around the world but first through 169 British cities and towns in a specific order; to prove his visit he would have to collect a signature from a local prominent resident. After that he would begin a tour of 18 countries and would have to visit them, also in a pre-specified order.
*Bensley was to finance himself, starting off with just GBP 1 and selling picture cards about himself;
*Only a change of underclothes was allowed as baggage;
*He was to complete the journey wearing an iron mask weighing 2 kg (4.5 lb) from a suit of armour;
*He was to push a perambulator (baby carriage) the entire journey; 
*Another man was to accompany him to see that he fulfilled the conditions at all times, and
*On the journey he was to find a wife without her seeing his face (note that he was possibly married already).

Bensley set off on 1 January 1908 from Trafalgar Square, London, with pamphlets and postcards of himself with which he intended to sell to finance his journey. He supposedly spent the next 6 and a half years on the road. Various tales tell about his journey; that he was arrested in Bexleyheath, Kent, for selling postcards without a licence and that the judge only fined him when he explained the conditions of the bet. It was also said that he sold a postcard to Edward VII and that Edward asked for Bensley&#x27;s autograph, which Bensley refused as signing his name would have revealed his identity. (Another account of this encounter has Edward refusing to sign &quot;his&quot; autograph for Bensley.)

He supposedly received 200 marriage offers but accepted none of them. An unnamed newspaper was told to have promised £1,000 reward to someone who would reveal his identity.

===Outcome===
There is some dispute about to what extent Bensley actually complied with the terms of the wager. There is no documentary evidence that Bensley travelled far outside the British Isles but reports claimed that he got as far as China and Japan.

According to the original tale, on 14 August 1914, Bensley found himself in Genoa, Italy, claiming to have completed 30,000 miles of the journey and having only seven countries remaining on his itinerary. That month, World War I had begun and Bensley abandoned his journey, returning to fight for his country. One version of the tale claims that Morgan contacted him, called the bet off because of the war and gave him £4,000 for consolation, which Bensley gave to charity. However, this version cannot be true as J.P. Morgan died in March 1913. Others claim that Bensley himself decided to quit and fulfil his duty to enlist.

In 2018, a book was published, entitled &quot;Iron Mask: The Story of Harry Bensley&#x27;s &quot;Walking Round the World&quot; Hoax&quot;, which claimed that the entire stunt had been a hoax.

Bensley served in the British Army in the first year of the War, was severely wounded and eventually invalided out of the army in 1915. Bensley lost his fortune in the Bolshevik Revolution when his investments in Russia became worthless and he was left destitute.

==Later years==
After the war Bensley moved to live in Wivenhoe, Essex, with his wife Kate, to whom he may have been married as early as 1898. He worked in low-status jobs like cinema doorman, a YMCA warden and was twice elected local councillor for the Labour Party. According to one report, during the Second World War Bensley was a bomb checker at an ammunition factory.

Harry Bensley died in a bed-sitting room in Brighton, England on 21 May 1956.

<doc id="472548" wikidata="Q129746" url="?curid=472548" title="Kay Petre">
<text>Kathleen Coad Petre (&#x27;Defries; 10 May 1903 – 10 August 1994), known asKay Petre, was an early motor racing star. She was born in York, Ontario, now part of Toronto.

==Family==
Kathleen Coad Defries was the daughter of Robert Leo Defries KC (died 1957) and his wife, Annie Gray. Her father was a barrister in Toronto. She spent her later schooldays in England, but returned to Canada in her twenties. After a period studying art in Paris, she returned to Canada to marry Langlois D. Lefroy, the son of A.H.Frazer Lefroy and Dora Strathy, in 1924. She was widowed two months later. In 1929, she married, secondly, to the Englishman Henry Aloysius Petre (1884–1962), who forsook a law career to pursue an interest in aviation. They had no children.

==Racing career==

Petre was a star at the English Brooklands track, and the exploits of this 4&#x27; 10&quot; lady caused a media sensation at the time. The abiding image of Petre is a tiny woman seated in a huge 10.5 litre V12 Delage. This was the car in which she battled for the Women&#x27;s Outer Circuit Record at Brooklands with Gwenda Stewart. Petre gained the upper hand on 26 October 1934 with a 129.58 mph lap, but in August 1935 Stewart fought back with a faster lap. A determined Petre took her record back the same day with a 134.75 mph pass but Stewart, driving the Derby-Miller, had the last laugh three days later at 135.95 mph.

At Brooklands: &quot;Kay Petre got three lap records, her first two in 1934, first in a Bugatti at 124 mph then in a Delage at 129.58 mph. In 1935 she used the Delage to achieve 134.75.&quot;

Although she is always associated with the Delage, Petre started racing in a Wolseley Hornet Special bought for her by her husband. She also raced an Invicta and a Bugatti in which she won a handicap race in 1935. However, she was most successful in a series of Rileys. She was ninth in the Mountain Grand Prix at Brooklands in a Riley 1.5 in 1934, against tough opposition. Her first visit to Le Mans was also that year. She and Dorothy Champney finished 13th, driving a Riley Ulster Imp. The Riley connection continued next year, but Petre and Elsie &quot;Bill&quot; Wisdom failed to finish with a blown engine.

Between 1934 and 1936, Petre was a regular at all the big British races like the Brooklands 500 Miles and Double Twelve Hours, plus sports car races at Donington Park and Crystal Palace. She partnered some big names, such as Dudley Benjafield and Prince Bira of Siam. She also drove in rallies and was an accomplished hillclimb driver, claiming the Ladies&#x27; Record at Shelsley Walsh twice.

In 1937 Petre travelled to South Africa for the Grand Prix motor racing season with her Riley. Here she befriended Bernd Rosemeyer, who was racing for Auto Union. Competing against him and other top drivers of the day, she drove in three Grands Prix, scoring a sixth place in the Grosvenor GP at Cape Town, but failing to finish the others. In September 1937, she went to France to race a &quot;Grasshopper&quot; Austin in the Paris to Nice rally.

She was driving for the works Austin team at Brooklands in September 1937 when her career was ended by a terrible accident. During practice for the 500 Kilometre race, Reg Parnell misjudged an overtaking move, lost speed, slid down the banking and hit her Austin Seven from behind. She crashed badly and was seriously injured. She never raced competitively again.

==Journalism==
After this accident Petre turned to journalism. She wrote for the Kelmsley newspaper group, including the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;.

On 20 January 1939, whilst covering the Monte Carlo rally, the car she was driving was involved in an accident in Amberieu-en-Bugey near Lyon in France. Her passenger, fellow journalist Reggie Empson was killed instantly and Petre was badly injured. Petre and the driver of the lorry were charged with manslaughter, but no further legal action was taken against Petre as she had returned to the UK and the Second World War had broken out. Reggie Empson&#x27;s widow Stella Empson (née Pierres), a former actress known as the &quot;Modern Venus&quot;, started proceedings against Petre and after a long battle received an out of court settlement of £4,000.

During the Second World War Petre was a food writer, but then became motoring correspondent for &quot;The Daily Graphic&quot; magazine.

== Design career ==
In the early 1950s, Petre was employed by Austin as a &quot;colour consultant&quot; to suggest colours and combinations for the new A40/A50 Cambridge. Many of her ideas, such as bright blues and pinks and following the clothes fashions of the day using brown, dark red and rust were not adopted, but her ideas for the cars&#x27; interior colours and fabrics were adopted. Later Leonard Lord appointed her as a colour consultant to the British Motor Corporation, charged with brightening up the Austin image to appeal to women drivers. She also designed fabric patterns for the interior of the Mini.

== Later life ==
After her husband&#x27;s death she lived alone in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, then as a resident in a care home, Parkwood House, Camden, where she died on 10 August 1994. She was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.

<text>In geometry, the subtangent and related terms are certain line segments defined using the line tangent to a curve at a given point and the coordinate axes. The terms are somewhat archaic today but were in common use until the early part of the 20th century.

==Definitions==
Let &quot;P&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) be a point on a given curve with &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, 0) its projection onto the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Draw the tangent to the curve at &quot;P&quot; and let &quot;T&quot; be the point where this line intersects the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Then &quot;TA&quot; is defined to be the subtangent at &quot;P&quot;. Similarly, if normal to the curve at &quot;P&quot; intersects the &quot;x&quot;-axis at &quot;N&quot; then &quot;AN&quot; is called the subnormal. In this context, the lengths &quot;PT&quot; and &quot;PN&quot; are called the tangent and normal, not to be confused with the tangent line and the normal line which are also called the tangent and normal.

==Equations==
Let &quot;φ&quot; be the angle of inclination of the tangent with respect to the &quot;x&quot;-axis; this is also known as the tangential angle. Then 
:formula_1
So the subtangent is 
:formula_2
and the subnormal is 
:formula_3
The normal is given by
:formula_4
and the tangent is given by
:formula_5

==Polar definitions==

Let &quot;P&quot; = (&quot;r&quot;, θ) be a point on a given curve defined by polar coordinates and let &quot;O&quot; denote the origin. Draw a line through &quot;O&quot; which is perpendicular to &quot;OP&quot; and let &quot;T&quot; now be the point where this line intersects the tangent to the curve at &quot;P&quot;. Similarly, let &quot;N&quot; now be the point where the normal to the curve intersects the line. Then &quot;OT&quot; and &quot;ON&quot; are, respectively, called the polar subtangent and polar subnormal of the curve at &quot;P&quot;.

==Polar equations==
Let &quot;ψ&quot; be the angle between the tangent and the ray &quot;OP&quot;; this is also known as the polar tangential angle. Then
:formula_6
So the polar subtangent is 
:formula_7
and the subnormal is 
:formula_8

<text>An argumentum ad crumenam argument, also known as an argument to the purse, is the informal fallacy of drawing conclusions based on the speaker&#x27;s financial status. The term generally refers to the assumption that having wealth is indicative of insight or virtue, and that poverty denotes the opposite.

The opposite is the &quot;argumentum ad lazarum&quot;.

Examples:
*&quot;If you&#x27;re so smart, why aren&#x27;t you rich?&quot;
*&quot;This new law is a good idea. Most of the people against it are riff-raff who make less than $20,000 a year.&quot;

<text>The Rasheed (or sometimes known as the &quot;Rashid&quot;) is a semi-automatic carbine, derived from the Hakim rifle and used by the Egyptian military. Only around 8,000 were made.

The Rasheed was designed by the Swedish engineer Erik Eklund, who based it on his previous Hakim rifle, which was itself a slightly modified version of the Swedish Ag m/42 rifle.

==Design==
The carbine resembles the Soviet SKS carbine, particularly in the permanently attached pivoting-blade bayonet, which appears identical to its Russian counterpart. The 12-inch (305 mm) blade bayonet pivots from a mount under the barrel, back into a recessed groove in the forend stock.

The carbine features a rear ladder sight, with a &quot;battle&quot; position for short-range fire as well as increments of 100 to 1000 metres, although the latter distance greatly exceeds the 300-metre effective range of the weapon.

The semi-automatic mechanism is gas-operated through the direct impingement system. The Egyptian training manual had users use stripper clips to reload. However, the hot gas would heat up the receiver and cause burns when fingers would touch the receiver.

The Rasheed has a 10-round magazine capacity.

==Variants==

===Baghdad Rifle===
The Baghdad is a variant of the Rasheed, made from the same machinery from 1969 to 1977.

<text>Barrow-wights are wraith-like creatures in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s world of Middle-earth. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the four hobbits are trapped by a barrow-wight, and are lucky to escape with their lives; but they gain ancient swords of Westernesse for their quest. 

Tolkien derived the idea of barrow-wights from Norse mythology, where heroes of several Sagas battle undead beings known as draugrs. Scholars have noted a resemblance, too, between the breaking of the barrow-wight&#x27;s spell and the final battle in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, where the dragon&#x27;s barrow is entered and the treasure released from its spell. Barrow-wights do not appear in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, but they do feature in computer games based on Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth.

== Origins ==

A barrow is a burial mound, such as was used in Neolithic times.

A &quot;wight&quot;, from Old English: &quot;wiht&quot;, is a person or other sentient being. 

There are tales of wights, called &quot;vǣttr&quot; or &quot;draugr&quot;, undead grave-spirits with bodies, in Norse mythology. In Norway, country people in places such as Eidanger considered that the dead went on living in their tombs as &quot;vetter&quot; or protective spirits, and up to modern times continued to offer sacrifices on the grave-mounds.

Tolkien stated in his &quot;Nomenclature of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot; that &quot;barrow-wight&quot; was an &quot;invented name&quot;, rather than one like &quot;orc&quot; that existed in Old English. He explained further in a lecture on &quot;Beowulf&quot; that &quot;orcneas&quot; (&quot;hell-corpses&quot;), the evil monsters born of Cain and leading to the monster Grendel, meant: 

However, the term was used by Andrew Lang in his 1891 &quot;Essays in Little&quot;, where he wrote &quot;In the graves where treasures were hoarded the Barrowwights dwelt, ghosts that were sentinels over the gold.&quot; Eiríkr Magnússon and William Morris used it, too, in their 1869 translation of &quot;Grettis saga&quot;, which features a fight with the &quot;barrow-wight&quot; or &quot;barrow-dweller&quot;, Kárr: 

The &quot;Grettis Saga&quot; further links the defeat of the barrow-wight to the recovery of an ancient treasure, which comes to the sight of the heir of the house to which it had once belonged: 

The &quot;Grettis Saga&quot; calls the undead monsters Glámr and Kárr &quot;haugbúar&quot; (&quot;mound-dwellers&quot;, singular &quot;haugbúi&quot;; a similar term is &quot;draugr&quot;). It influenced Tolkien&#x27;s barrow-wights, whether directly from the Old Norse or by way of Magnússon and Morris&#x27;s translation.

Barrow-wights have appeared in Scandinavian literature in the modern era, for instance in the Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman&#x27;s 1791 song no. 32 &quot;Träd fram du Nattens Gud&quot; (&quot;Step forth, thou god of night&quot;), whose second stanza runs (translated): 

Both the barrow-wight and the character Tom Bombadil first appeared in Tolkien&#x27;s writings in his poem &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, published in the &quot;Oxford Magazine&quot; of 15 February 1934.

== &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; narrative ==



Evil spirits were sent to the Barrow-downs by the Witch-king of Angmar to prevent the restoration of the destroyed Dúnedain kingdom of Cardolan, one of three remnants of the Dúnedain Kingdom of Arnor. They animated the dead bones of the Dúnedain, as well as older bones of Edain from the First Age, which still were buried there.

After leaving Tom Bombadil, Frodo Baggins and company are trapped in the Barrow-downs, and nearly killed by a barrow-wight: 

Frodo manages to resist the wight&#x27;s spell; looking about, he sees the other hobbits dressed in grave-goods, in thin white clothes with gold circlets and chains, swords and shields around them, and a sword lying across their necks. He seizes a small sword and cuts off the wight&#x27;s hand. When the wight extinguishes the dim light in the cavern, Frodo calls for Tom Bombadil, who expels the wight from the barrow, rescues the hobbits, and recovers the wight&#x27;s treasure-hoard, which included ancient Númenórean swords. Frodo sees the separated hand continuing to wriggle by itself.

The cairn was that of the last prince of Cardolan; Merry&#x27;s exclamation on waking from his trance confirms this, as he names Carn Dûm, capital of the Witch-Kingdom of Angmar, continually at war with the Númenórean realms (and as Bombadil later explains):


Bombadil arms the hobbits from the barrow-wight&#x27;s hoard with what become known as barrow-blades:

When, much later, Pippin offers his service to the Steward of Gondor, Denethor, the old man examines his sword and asks &quot;Whence came this? ... Many, many years lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?&quot;

==Significance==
The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey comments that it is a &quot;great moment&quot; when Merry awakens in the barrow from the wight&#x27;s spell and &quot;remembers only a death not his own&quot;. He observes that Merry has taken on the warrior&#x27;s personality, not that of the wight, since Tom recalls the dead with affection. That leaves, Shippey writes, the question of who or what the wight was as a mystery. The deathly-white robes, the writhing hand, the hobbits arrayed for death, give the thrill of fantasy, but this is given solidity by being tied into a wider history which is at least hinted at.

The literature scholar Patrick Callahan notes that the whole Bombadil episode seems disconnected from the rest of the story, but that the barrow-wight story resembles the final fight in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, when the king, now old, goes out to do battle with the barrow-dragon. He dies, but the funeral-barrow&#x27;s treasure is recovered and the curse on it is broken, just as with the barrow-wight&#x27;s. Callahan observes, too, that the barrow-wight belongs to &quot;the class of revenants, or &#x27;walking dead&#x27;&quot;, as in the &quot;Grettis saga&quot; which Tolkien knew.

==In contemporary media==

Peter Jackson omitted barrow-wights from his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. The humanities scholar Brian Rosebury argues that the removal is acceptable to reduce running time, because the episode does not fundamentally change the story. On the other hand, the Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff notes that, since the Hobbits failed to acquire ancient blades from the barrow-wight&#x27;s hoard, they awkwardly receive their swords from their travel-companion Aragorn on Weathertop as the party is threatened with imminent attack; he coincidentally happens to be carrying four Hobbit-sized swords with him, despite only expecting to meet Frodo and Sam.

Despite their omission from the film trilogy, Barrow-wights appear in games such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot;. A barrow-wight features in the low-budget 1991 Russian adaptation of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;Khraniteli&quot;, apparently the first moving picture to include the character.

Barrow-wights have appeared in the second season of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. VFX supervisor Jason Smith described their adaptation as &quot;ancient, reanimated heroes, acting for evil against their will.&quot; Smith further noted that their character design would reflect their noble status in life as &quot;[k]ings, queens, high-ranking officials&quot;, contrasted by their &quot;glowing blue eyes, piercing through the dark&quot;. The &quot;Rings of Power&quot; VFX team took the opportunity to reflect on Tolkien&#x27;s writings, with Smith stating, &quot;The feeling the passages give you is of a doom that is approaching, not by speed but by being indefatigable... It&#x27;s a menace that is just going to encroach an inch at a time until you have nowhere to go and you die.&quot;

<doc id="472557" wikidata="Q2861099" url="?curid=472557" title="Argumentum ad lazarum">
<text>Argumentum ad lazarum or appeal to poverty is the informal fallacy of thinking a conclusion is correct solely because the speaker is poor, or it is incorrect because the speaker is rich. It is named after Lazarus, a beggar in a New Testament parable who receives his reward in the afterlife.

This is popularly summarized as the statement, &quot;Poor, but honest.&quot;

The opposite is the &quot;argumentum ad crumenam&quot;.

Some experimental evidence supports the appeal to poverty. A 2017 study by Igor Grossmann and Justin Brienza at the University of Waterloo in Canada found that when &quot;wisdom&quot; is defined as the ability to consider opposing perspectives and find a compromise that defuses an interpersonal dispute, poor and working-class people are more likely to show such an ability compared to those in higher socioeconomic classes. As with all fallacies though, the tendency is not absolute.

== Examples ==
* &quot;Family farms are struggling to get by so when they say we need to protect them, they must be on to something.&quot;
* &quot;The homeless tell us it&#x27;s hard to find housing. Thus it must be.&quot;
* &quot;The monks have forsworn all material possessions. They must have achieved enlightenment.&quot;
* &quot;All you need to know about the civil war in that country is that the rebels live in mud huts, while the general who sends troops against them sits in a luxurious, air-conditioned office.&quot;

<text>The Kalamazoo River is a river in the U.S. state of Michigan. The river is long from the junction of its North and South branches to its mouth at Lake Michigan, with a total length extending to when one includes the South Branch. The river&#x27;s watershed drains an area of approximately and drains portions of ten counties in southwest Michigan: Allegan, Barry, Eaton, Van Buren, Kalamazoo, Calhoun, Jackson, Hillsdale, Kent and Ottawa. The river has a median flow of at New Richmond, upstream from its mouth at Saugatuck and Douglas.

The north and south branches of the Kalamazoo River originate within a few miles of each other. The south branch begins near North Adams in Moscow Township in northeastern Hillsdale County and flows north and west through Homer before joining the north branch at the forks of the Kalamazoo River in Albion. The North Branch begins near Farwell and Pine Hills lakes in southern Jackson County and flows north and west through Concord before reaching Albion in Calhoun County. It then flows through Kalamazoo and Allegan counties.

After Albion, the Kalamazoo flows mostly westward through Marshall, Battle Creek, Augusta, Galesburg, Comstock, and Kalamazoo. From Kalamazoo, the river flows mostly north until just before it reaches Plainwell and then flows northwest through Otsego, Allegan, Saugatuck and then into Lake Michigan.

Some of the larger tributaries of the Kalamazoo are Rice Creek, Wilder Creek, Wabascon Creek, Battle Creek River, Augusta Creek, Portage Creek, Gun River, Swan Creek, and Rabbit River.

==History==

Archeological evidence indicates humans have used the Kalamazoo River basin continuously for more than 11,000 years. At the time of European contact, the Kalamazoo River area was inhabited primarily by members of Potawatomi tribes. The Jesuit priest Father Jacques Marquette and his companions were probably the first Europeans to glimpse the mouth of the Kalamazoo in 1675 as they returned from Illinois. It wasn&#x27;t until the late eighteenth century that the area was frequented by fur traders. By the early nineteenth century, there were several small communities along the river, including Kalamazoo. With the introduction of the railroad in the 1840s, the importance of the river for transportation diminished.

By the mid-19th century, several communities had grown up along the River as mill towns and commercial centers: Battle Creek, Kalamazoo, Parchment, Plainwell, and Otsego. After the Civil War and into the 20th century, various industries, from cereal production to pharmaceuticals to automobile parts, flourished. Several communities became sites for paper production, which used the river for water intake and waste discharge. Deinking practices no longer in use led to PCB contamination of the river. Sewage effluent, other industrial discharges, and trash also contributed to the pollution of the river. For many years in the 1940s to 1960s, the river was an &quot;eyesore&quot; and most people did their best to avoid it. Beginning in the 1970s with the federal Clean Water Act, serious efforts were made to clean up the river. Although today the river is cleaner, the persistent PCB contamination has led to Superfund designation of a section from Kalamazoo to Allegan Dam. Many species of fish inhabit the river, including smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, catfish, carp, and many types of panfish. Though populations have increased in recent years due to the cleanup of the river, it is still advised for people to not eat large amounts of fish from the Kalamazoo River, and pregnant women are also advised not to eat any fish from the river due to lingering effects of the pollution in the diets of many fish (particularly bottom feeding fish like catfish which can accumulate high levels of mercury).

In the late 1950s, a developer at the North Branch headwaters (Farwell and Pinehill Lakes) was allowed to build a dam which raised the level of both of those lakes so that he might operate a commercial marina. The dam caused many soil sediments to enter the lake through the raised water level and resultant erosion. The residents of Farwell Lake have been very actively working to restore the once pristine quality of that lake. A municipal area sewer system branch has been added and great efforts are being made to educate lake users about keeping fuels, lawn chemicals and fertilizers, etc. out of the water. The property owners are hopeful that the dam will be removed and allow the headwaters to flow naturally again and restore the lake to its natural sandy shoreline.

Although the word Kalamazoo appears to be Native American in origin, the exact meaning is obscure and various definitions have been suggested. See the article on the Etymology of Kalamazoo for a detailed discussion of name origin theories.

==Kalamazoo River oil spill==
On 26 July 2010, an Enbridge Energy pipeline leaked more than of tar sands also known as dilbit into Talmadge Creek that flows into the Kalamazoo, initially causing two homes to be evacuated, and prohibitions against fishing and swimming to be posted. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) later estimated the spill to be in excess of 1 million gallons. On 29 July 2010, the Calhoun County Health Department asked 30 to 50 households to evacuate, and twice as many were advised not to drink their water. The National Transportation Safety Board stated the Enbridge oil spill is the costliest onshore cleanup in U.S. history.

<doc id="472560" wikidata="Q704553" url="?curid=472560" title="Chris Van Allsburg">
<text>Chris Van Allsburg (born June 18, 1949) is an American writer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. He has won two Caldecott Medals for U.S. picture book illustration, for &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (1985), both of which he also wrote, and were later adapted as successful motion pictures. He was also a Caldecott runner-up in 1980 for &quot;The Garden of Abdul Gasazi&quot;. For his contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator, he was a 1986 U.S. nominee for the biennial International Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition for creators of children&#x27;s books. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Michigan in April 2012.

==Life and career==
Van Allsburg was born on June 18, 1949, to a Dutch family in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the second child of Doris Christianen and Richard Van Allsburg. He has an older sister named Karen, born in 1947. Van Allsburg and his family lived in an old farmhouse, but when he was three years old, they moved to a Grand Rapids home near an elementary school so that Chris was able to walk to class. His family moved again to where he attended middle school and high school. 

Van Allsburg attended the College of Architecture and Design at the University of Michigan, which at that time included an art school. He majored in sculpture, learning bronze casting, wood carving, resin molding, and other techniques.

Van Allsburg graduated from the University of Michigan in 1972 and continued his education at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in sculpture in 1975. After graduation, Van Allsburg set up a sculpture studio.

Van Allsburg struggled for a time with his sculpture studio. At home, Van Allsburg began a series of sketches that his wife Lisa thought would be suitable for children&#x27;s books. She showed his work to an editor who contracted his first book, &quot;The Garden of Abdul Gasazi&quot;, in 1979.

As of 2022, Van Allsburg has written and/or illustrated 21 books. His art has also been featured on the covers of an edition of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s series &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, published by HarperCollins in 1994, as well as in three children&#x27;s books written by Mark Helprin.

== Personal life ==
Van Allsburg lives in Providence, Rhode Island, with his wife Lisa. They have two daughters, Sophia and Anna. Upon marrying his wife, Van Allsburg converted to Judaism, the latter&#x27;s faith.

<doc id="472573" wikidata="Q447716" url="?curid=472573" title="Madam C. J. Walker">
<text>Madam C. J. Walker (born Sarah Breedlove;November 23, 1867 – May 25, 1919) was an American entrepreneur, philanthropist, and political and social activist. Walker is recorded as the first female self-made millionaire in America in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Multiple sources mention that although other women (like Mary Ellen Pleasant) might have been the first, their wealth is not as well-documented.

Walker made her fortune by developing and marketing a line of cosmetics and hair care products for Black women through the business she founded, Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company. Walker became known also for her philanthropy and activism. Walker made financial donations to numerous organizations such as the NAACP and became a patron of the arts. Villa Lewaro, Walker&#x27;s lavish estate in the Irvington neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana served as a social gathering place for the African-American community. At the time of her death, Walker was considered the wealthiest African-American businesswoman and wealthiest self-made black woman in America. Her name was a version of &quot;Mrs. Charles Joseph Walker&quot; after her third husband.

==Early life==
Madam C. J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on December 23, 1867, close to Delta, Louisiana. Breedlove&#x27;s parents were Owen and Minerva (née Anderson) Breedlove. Breedlove had five siblings, who included an older sister, Louvenia, and four brothers: Alexander, James, Solomon, and Owen Jr. Robert W. Burney enslaved her older siblings and parents on his Madison Parish plantation; Sarah was the first child in her family born into freedom after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Her mother died in 1872, likely from cholera; an epidemic traveled with river passengers up the Mississippi, reaching Tennessee and related areas in 1873. Her father remarried but died a year later.

Orphaned at 7, Breedlove moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, at 10, where she lived with Louvenia and her brother-in-law, Jesse Powell. Breedlove started working as a child as a domestic servant.
&quot;I had little or no opportunity when I started out in life, having been left an orphan and being without mother or father since I was seven years of age,&quot; Breedlove often recounted. Breedlove also stated that she had only three months of formal education, which she undertook during Sunday school literacy lessons at the church she attended during her earlier years.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
In 1882, at the age of 14, Breedlove married Moses McWilliams whose age was unknown, to escape abuse from her brother-in-law, Jesse Powell. Breedlove and McWilliams had one daughter, Lelia, who was born on June 6, 1885. When McWilliams died in 1887, Breedlove was twenty; Lelia was two. Breedlove remarried in 1894, but left her second husband, John Davis, around 1903.

In January 1906, Breedlove married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman she had known in St. Louis, Missouri. After this marriage, Breedlove began marketing herself as &quot;Madam C. J. Walker&quot;. The couple divorced in 1912; Charles died in 1926. Lelia McWilliams adopted her stepfather&#x27;s surname and became known as A&#x27;Lelia Walker.

===Religion===
Walker was a Christian; her faith had a significant influence on her philanthropy. Walker was a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

==Career==

In 1888, Breedlove moved, with Lelia, to St. Louis, where three of her brothers lived. Breedlove found work as a laundress, earning barely more than a dollar a day. Breedlove was determined to make enough money to provide Lelia with formal education. During the 1880s, Breedlove lived in a community where Ragtime music was developed; she sang at St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church and started to yearn for an educated life as she watched the community of women at her church.

Breedlove suffered severe dandruff and other scalp ailments, including baldness, due to skin disorders and the application of harsh products to cleanse hair and wash clothes. Other contributing factors to her hair loss included poor diet, illnesses, and infrequent bathing and hair washing during a time when most Americans lacked indoor plumbing, central heating, and electricity.

Initially, Breedlove learned about hair care from her brothers, who were barbers in St. Louis. Around the time of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (World&#x27;s Fair at St. Louis in 1904), Breedlove became a commission agent selling products for Annie Turnbo Malone, an African-American haircare entrepreneur and owner of the Poro Company. Sales at the exposition were a disappointment since the African-American community was largely ignored.

While working for Malone, who would later become a significant rival in the haircare industry, Breedlove began to take her new knowledge and develop a product line. In July 1905, when Breedlove was 37 years old, she moved with Lelia to Denver, Colorado, where she initially continued to sell products for Malone while developing her own haircare business. However, the two businesswomen had a falling-out when Malone accused Breedlove of stealing her formula, a mixture of petroleum jelly and sulfur that had been in use for a hundred years.

After marrying Charles Walker in 1906, Breedlove marketed herself as &quot;Madam C. J. Walker&quot;, an independent hairdresser and cosmetic cream retailer. (&quot;Madam&quot; was adopted from women pioneers of the French beauty industry.) Charles, also her business partner, provided advice on advertising and promotion. Walker sold her products door to door, teaching other black women how to groom and style their hair.

In 1906, Walker put A&#x27;Lelia in charge of the mail-order operation in Denver while she and Charles traveled throughout the southern and eastern United States to expand the business. In 1908, Walker and her husband relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they opened a beauty parlor and established Lelia College to train &quot;hair culturists&quot;. As an advocate of black women&#x27;s economic independence, Walker opened training programs in the &quot;Walker System&quot; for her national network of licensed sales agents who earned healthy commissions (Michaels, PhD. 2015).

After Walker closed the business in Denver in 1907, A&#x27;Lelia joined her in Pittsburgh. In 1910, when Walker established a new base in Indianapolis, A&#x27;Lelia ran the day-to-day operations in Pittsburgh. A&#x27;Lelia also persuaded her mother to establish an office and beauty salon in New York City&#x27;s growing Harlem neighborhood in 1913; it became a center of African-American culture.

In 1910, Walker relocated her businesses to Indianapolis, where she established the headquarters for the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company. Walker initially purchased a house and factory at 640 North West Street. Walker later built a factory, hair salon, and beauty school to train her sales agents and added a laboratory to help with research. Walker also assembled a staff that included Freeman Ransom, Robert Lee Brokenburr, Alice Kelly, and Marjorie Joyner, among others, to assist in managing the growing company. Many of her company&#x27;s employees, including those in key management and staff positions, were women.
Walker designed a method of grooming to promote hair growth and to condition the scalp through the use of her products. The system included a shampoo, a pomade stated to help hair grow, strenuous brushing, and applying iron combs to hair; Walker purported that method made lackluster and brittle hair soft and luxuriant. Walker&#x27;s product line had several competitors. Walker&#x27;s competitors produced similar products in Europe and the United States, including Malone&#x27;s Poro System and Sarah Spencer Washington&#x27;s Apex System.

Between 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products. By 1917, the company claimed to have trained nearly 20,000 women. While some sources have written that the women dressed in a characteristic uniform of white shirts and black skirts and carried black satchels, there is nothing in the Walker Beauty School manual that verifies that. Others have written the agents focused on door-to-door sales as they visited houses around the United States and in the Caribbean offering Walker&#x27;s hair pomade and other products packaged in tin containers carrying her image. Still, the typical scenario involved Walker beauty culturists demonstrating their products in their homes and beauty salons because they needed a water source to show how the products worked. Walker understood the power of advertising and brand awareness. Heavy advertising, primarily in African-American newspapers and magazines, and Walker&#x27;s frequent travels to promote her products helped make her well-known in the United States.

In addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget and build businesses and encouraged them to become financially independent. In 1917, inspired by the model of the National Association of Colored Women, Walker began organizing her sales agents into state and local clubs. The result was the establishment of the National Beauty Culturists and Benevolent Association of Madam C. J. Walker Agents (predecessor to the Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America).

Its first annual conference convened in Philadelphia during the summer of 1917 with 200 attendees. The conference was among the first national gatherings of women entrepreneurs to discuss business and commerce. During the convention, Walker gave prizes to women who had sold the most products and brought in the most new sales agents. Walker also rewarded those who made the most considerable contributions to charities in their communities.

Walker&#x27;s name became even more widely known by the 1920s, after her death, as her company&#x27;s business market expanded beyond the United States to Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, Panama, and Costa Rica.

==Activism and philanthropy==

As Walker&#x27;s wealth and influence increased, she became more vocal about her views. In 1912, Walker addressed an annual gathering of the National Negro Business League (NNBL) from the convention floor, where she declared: &quot;I am a woman who came from the cotton fields of the South. From there, I was promoted to the washtub. From there, I was promoted to the cook kitchen. And from there, I promoted myself into the business of manufacturing hair goods and preparations. I have built my own factory on my own ground.&quot; The following year, Walker addressed convention-goers from the podium as a keynote speaker.

Walker helped raise funds to establish a branch of YMCA in Indianapolis&#x27;s black community, pledging $1,000 to the building fund for Senate Avenue YMCA. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the Tuskegee Institute. Other beneficiaries included Indianapolis&#x27;s Flanner House and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church; Mary McLeod Bethune&#x27;s Daytona Education and Industrial School for Negro Girls (which later became Bethune-Cookman University) in Daytona Beach, Florida; the Palmer Memorial Institute in North Carolina; and the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Georgia. Walker was also a patron of the arts.

About 1913, Walker&#x27;s daughter, A&#x27;Lelia, moved to a new townhouse in Harlem. In 1916, Walker joined her in New York, leaving the day-to-day operation of her company to her management team in Indianapolis. In 1917, Walker commissioned Vertner Tandy, the first licensed black architect in New York City and a founding member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, to design her house in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York. Walker intended for Villa Lewaro, which cost $250,000 to build, to become a gathering place for community leaders and to inspire other African Americans to pursue their dreams. Walker moved into the house in May 1918 and hosted an opening event to honor Emmett Jay Scott, at that time the Assistant Secretary for Negro Affairs of the U.S. Department of War.

Walker became more involved in political matters after her move to New York. Walker delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. Her friends and associates included Booker T. Washington, Mary McLeod Bethune, and W. E. B. Du Bois. During World War I, Walker was a leader in the Circle For Negro War Relief and advocated for the establishment of a training camp for black army officers. In 1917, Walker joined the executive committee of the New York chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which organized the Silent Protest Parade on New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue. The public demonstration drew more than 8,000 African Americans to protest a riot in East Saint Louis that killed 39 African Americans. Also, from 1917 until her death, Walker was a member of the Committee of Management of the Harlem YWCA, influencing the development of training in beauty skills to young women by the organization.

Profits from her business significantly impacted Walker&#x27;s contributions to her political and philanthropic interests. In 1918, the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs (NACWC) honored Walker for making the largest individual contribution to help preserve Frederick Douglass&#x27;s Anacostia house. Before Walker died in 1919, Walker pledged $5,000 (the equivalent of about $88,000 in 2023) to the NAACP&#x27;s anti-lynching fund. At the time, it was the largest gift from an individual that the NAACP had ever received. Walker bequeathed nearly $100,000 to orphanages, institutions, and individuals; her will directed two-thirds of future net profits of her estate to charity.

==Death and legacy==

Walker died on May 25, 1919, from kidney failure and complications of hypertension at the age of 51. Walker&#x27;s remains are interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

At the time of her death, Walker was considered worth between a half million and a million dollars. Walker was the wealthiest African-American woman in America. According to Walker&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;she said herself two years ago [in 1917] that she was not yet a millionaire, but hoped to be some time, not that she wanted the money for herself, but for the good she could do with it.&quot; The obituary also noted that same year, her $250,000 mansion was completed at the banks of the Hudson at Irvington. Her daughter, A&#x27;Lelia Walker, later became the president of the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company.

The Indiana Historical Society preserves Walker&#x27;s papers in Indianapolis. Walker&#x27;s legacy also continues through two properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Villa Lewaro in Irvington, New York, and the Madame Walker Theatre Center in Indianapolis. A fraternal organization called the Companions of the Forest in America purchased Villa Lewaro following A&#x27;Lelia Walker&#x27;s death in 1932. The National Register of Historic Places listed the house in 1979. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has designated the privately owned property a National Treasure.

Indianapolis&#x27;s Walker Manufacturing Company headquarters building (renamed the Madame Walker Theatre Center) opened in December 1927. It included the company&#x27;s offices and factory, a theater, a beauty school, a hair salon and barbershop, a restaurant, a drugstore, and a ballroom for the community. The National Register of Historic Places listed the building in 1980.

A museum devoted to Walker, as well as historic radio station WERD, established itself on the site of a former Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Shoppe in Atlanta.

In 2006, playwright and director Regina Taylor wrote The &quot;Dreams of Sarah Breedlove&quot;, recounting the history of Walker&#x27;s struggles and success. The play premiered at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Actress L. Scott Caldwell played the role of Walker.

On January 31, 2022, Sundial Brands, a division of Unilever, launched a collection of eleven new products under the brand name &quot;MADAM by Madam C. J. Walker&quot; and sold exclusively at Walmart. These products replace the line that was launched on March 4, 2016, by Sundial Brands, a skincare and haircare company, in collaboration with Sephora in honor of Walker&#x27;s legacy. The line &quot;Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culture&quot; comprised four collections focused on using natural ingredients to care for different hair types.

===TV series===
In 2020, actress Octavia Spencer committed to portraying Walker in a TV series based on &quot;On Her Own Ground&quot;, the biography of Walker written by Walker&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter, A&#x27;Lelia Bundles. The series is called &quot;Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C. J. Walker&quot;. Reviews for the series were mixed, partly because of the inaccuracies of the storyline that created more of a fictional work than an authentic biography. The portrayal of Annie Malone as Addie Monroe, another black female self-made millionaire as a villain and the daughter of Walker as a lesbian were some of the complaints by audiences. Biographer A&#x27;Lelia Bundles wrote about the behind-the-scenes experience of producing &quot;Self Made&quot; in &quot;Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Self-Made&quot; Suffers from Self-Inflicted Wounds&quot;.

===Documentary===
Walker is featured in Stanley Nelson&#x27;s 1987 documentary, &quot;Two Dollars and a Dream&quot;, the first film treatment of Walker&#x27;s life. As the grandson of Freeman B. Ransom, Walker&#x27;s attorney and Walker Company general manager, Nelson had access to the original Walker business records and former Walker Company employees he interviewed during the 1980s.

==Tributes==
Various organizations have named scholarships and awards in Walker&#x27;s honor:
* The Madam C. J. Walker Business and Community Recognition Awards are sponsored by the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Oakland / Bay Area chapter. An annual luncheon honors Walker and awards scholarships to outstanding women in the community.
* Spirit Awards have sponsored the Madame Walker Theatre Center in Indianapolis. Established as a tribute to Walker, the annual award has honored national leaders in entrepreneurship, philanthropy, civic engagement, and the arts since 2006. Awards presented to individuals include the Madame C. J. Walker Heritage Award and Young Entrepreneur and Legacy prizes.

The National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York, inducted Walker in 1993. In 1998, the U.S. Postal Service issued a Madam Walker commemorative stamp as part of its Black Heritage Series. In 2022, Mattel issued a Madam C.J. Walker Barbie doll as part of their Inspiring Women doll collection.

<text>Secret Garden is an Irish-Norwegian band specialised in new instrumental music, led by the duo consisting of Irish violinist and singer Fionnuala Sherry and Norwegian composer, arranger and pianist Rolf Løvland.

The group came to fame when they won the 1995 Eurovision Song Contest, representing Norway with the composition &quot;Nocturne&quot;. In the course of a partnership lasting over 25 years, they have sold millions of albums worldwide, many of which went platinum in numerous countries.

==History==
===Eurovision Song Contest===
The group won the Eurovision Song Contest for Norway&#x27;s second time in 1995 with the composition &quot;Nocturne&quot;. It was the only time that a predominantly instrumental piece has won the Eurovision Song Contest, although a few Norwegian lyrics, written by screenwriter Petter Skavlan, were included to ensure that the entry adhered to the contest&#x27;s rules. Norwegian singer Gunnhild Tvinnereim sang the song in the Eurovision Song Contest, with Hans Fredrik Jacobsen on penny whistle and Swedish nyckelharpist Åsa Jinder guesting on the occasion, although none of them are regular members of the group. Ten years earlier, Rolf Løvland wrote the song &quot;La det swinge&quot; (Let it swing) that secured Norway its first Eurovision Song Contest victory in 1985.

===Debut album===
Their success at Eurovision spearheaded the success of their first album &quot;Songs from a Secret Garden&quot;. It sold a million copies around the world going platinum in Norway and Korea, gold in Ireland, Hong Kong and New Zealand and spending two years in the Billboard new-age charts in 1996 and 1997. Barbra Streisand adapted &quot;Heartstrings&quot; from this album as the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Dreamed of You&quot; on her &quot;A Love Like Ours&quot; album. She also used &quot;Heartstrings&quot; in her wedding to James Brolin.

===Further albums===
Their sophomore album &quot;White Stones&quot; followed in 1997, and also made the top ten on Billboard New Age charts. &quot;Dawn of a New Century&quot; was released in 1999 as their third studio album, and again featured lyrics by Norway&#x27;s Petter Skavlan. Their 2001 studio album &quot;Once in a Red Moon&quot; also enjoyed success around the world, including reaching Billboard&#x27;s new-age top ten.

A compilation album, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, was released in 2000. Secret Garden released a &quot;Dreamcatcher: Best Of&quot; album for its tour through Australia and New Zealand in 2004, and this reached the top of the Australian New Age charts and the ARIA top 50 album charts.

After several other albums, they released their tenth album, &quot;Storyteller&quot;, in 2019.

=== Notable songs ===
Secret Garden&#x27;s most famous song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, originally performed by Johnny Logan and Brian Kennedy, has been recorded by more than a hundred other artists including Josh Groban, Russell Watson, Westlife, Sissel Kyrkjebø, Becky Taylor, Celtic Woman, Lena Park, Robert Tremlett, Il Divo, Rhydian, and Sergio Dalma.

&quot;Nocturne&quot; won the 1995 Eurovision Song Contest. Their piece &quot;Adagio&quot;, with a cor anglais solo, was used in the Wong Kar-wai film 2046 which was released in 2004.

=== Autobiographical book ===
In 2015, Secret Garden published a book titled &quot;You Raise Me Up: The Story of Secret Garden&quot; co-written by Rolf Løvland with Fionnuala Sherry. The book tells their story of their triumphs as well as the trials and tribulations they endured along two decades.

<text>The spotwing flying gurnard (&quot;Dactyloptena macracantha&quot;) is an unusual looking fish because of its huge pectoral fins. The fish has dark spots and wavy lines on the fins. It has a dull head and a grey or sometimes brown body that is covered with dark brown or black spots.

Despite its name, the spotwing flying gurnard is not related to the true flyingfish; these are in the family Exocoetidae, order Beloniformes. Neither is it able to fly, or even to glide as the true flyingfish do.

These fish can grow to 38 cm in length. They feed on crustaceans, clams and small fishes. They have feeler-like leading rays and extensions from each fin ray. When disturbed, they quickly expand their pectoral fins, often retracting them before swimming off at speed. 

Although the flying gurnard does not fly, it can &quot;walk&quot; on the bottom by alternatively moving its pelvic fins and short pectoral fin rays.

This Indo-Pacific species occurs from the northern Indian Ocean to Japan.

<text>Collingwood is a town in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. It is situated on Nottawasaga Bay at the southern point of Georgian Bay. Collingwood is well known as a tourist destination, for its skiing in the winter, and limestone caves along the Niagara Escarpment in the summer.

==History==

The land in the area was first inhabited by the Iroquoian-speaking Petun nation, which built a string of villages in the vicinity of the nearby Niagara Escarpment. They were driven from the region by the Iroquois in 1650 who withdrew from the region around 1700. White settlers and freed Black slaves arrived in the area in the 1840s and brought with them their religion and culture.

Collingwood was incorporated as a town in 1858, nine years before Confederation, and was named after Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Lord Nelson&#x27;s second in command at the Battle of Trafalgar, who assumed command of the British fleet after Nelson&#x27;s death.

The area had several other names associated with it, including Hurontario (because it lies at the end of Hurontario Street, which runs from Lake Huron — of which Georgian Bay is a part — south to Lake Ontario), Nottawa, and Hens-and-Chickens Harbour (because of one large and four small islands in the bay).

In 1855, the Ontario, Simcoe &amp; Huron (later called the Northern) Railway came into Collingwood, and the harbour became the shipment point for goods destined for the upper Great Lakes ports of Chicago and Port Arthur-Fort William (now Thunder Bay). Grain was one of the primary products by tonnage shipped, and a large grain elevator; Collingwood Terminals Limited; was built on the waterfront for transshipment of grain from trains and later trucks to lake freighters in 1929, and operated for 64 years until 1993. It still stands today.

Shipping produced a need for ship repairs and so it was not long before an organized shipbuilding business was created. On May 24, 1883, the Collingwood Shipyards, formally known as Collingwood Dry Dock Shipbuilding and Foundry Company Limited, opened with a special ceremony. On September 12, 1901, the &quot;Huronic&quot;, the first steel-hulled ship in Canada, was launched in Collingwood. The shipyards produced lake freighters and during World War II contributed to the production of corvettes for the Royal Canadian Navy. Shipbuilding was one of the principal industries in the town, employing as much as 10% of the total labour force. However, overseas competition and overcapacity in shipbuilding in Canada led to the demise of shipbuilding in Collingwood in September 1986.

The creation of government incentive programs and a fully-serviced industrial park made it possible for Collingwood to attract eleven new manufacturing firms to the town by 1971. Eight additional manufacturing companies had located in the town by 1983, which made Collingwood the largest industrial employer in the region.

==Economy==
Collingwood&#x27;s industrial base, which includes Pilkington Glass of Canada, Goodall Rubber Company - Canada ULC, and VOAC Inc, and which are among the community&#x27;s largest employers, has begun to erode.

Several industries in the area have closed, including Collingwood Ethanol L.P., Nacan Products (2004), Backyard Products (2004), Kaufman of Collingwood (2006 - land still vacant), Goodyear Tires (2007 - plant built in 1967 was demolished after 2019 and now vacant), Alcoa Wheel products (2008 - building now home to Barber Glass plant) and the Blue Mountain Pottery (2004). Collingwood is also home to the distillery where Canadian Mist Whisky is produced.

In June 2007, Collingwood Ethanol (now Amaizeingly Green) began production in the former Nacan facility. The company expected to produce 50 million litres of ethanol annually to satisfy regulatory requirements on ethanol content in gasoline mandated by the provincial and federal governments. Collingwood Ethanol also produces byproducts of the ethanol manufacturing process, including an organic corn gluten fertilizer.
Petitions have been submitted to the town by residents of a new housing development located across the road in an effort to force Collingwood Ethanol to reduce the amount of odour and noise that they are causing during the times when they are in full production. Before Collingwood Ethanol started production, however, Nacan (a starch plant that once occupied the now ethanol plant) also created a strong odour and noise. This made many locals wonder why a housing development would be built across the road from an industrial part of town. In December 2012, Amaizeingly Green filed for receivership of the plant. Due to the higher cost of corn, the plant has since been closed. Demolition of the plant started Dec 2018.

Located on the southern shores of Georgian Bay and close to Blue Mountain, a promontory of the Niagara Escarpment, the town is a major recreation area for the southern part of the province. Blue Mountain itself is noted for skiing, and also for its Scenic Caves. The town is also a short distance from Wasaga Beach Provincial Park, a destination that received the title of Biosphere Reserve in 2004.

Local media include the &quot;CollingwoodToday.ca News site&quot; and &quot;Collingwood-Wasaga Connection&quot; community newspapers, and radio station CKCB-FM. The Barrie-based regional television station CKVR-TV maintains a bureau in Collingwood, and the Owen Sound-based Bayshore Broadcasting radio group also has an office in Collingwood. The Collingwood annual week-end Elvis Presley festival attracted Elvis impersonators from the world over for 25 years but as of 2020 municipal support has been discontinued.

==Climate==

The climate of Collingwood is humid continental. The town is located in the snow belt region and receives modest amounts of both snow and rain through the year.

In the spring months there is a gradual warming due to the proximity of Georgian Bay. Frequent shower pass over the region this time of year and later on in the season can turn into severe storms. Temperatures this time of year range from .).

In the summer months, there are warm to hot humid conditions with frequent lake breezes to cool things off. Thunderstorms are regular occurrences in the summer and can sometimes be severe enough to cause tornadoes. Temperatures at this time of year can range from . The humidity will often make it feel much hotter than the actual temperature and can even make it feel like the mid-40s (110s °F.).

Fall generally arrives later here than the rest of Canada because of the warm waters of Georgian Bay. Strong storms, called November witches, can bring multiple days of strong winds with rain and snow. Lake effect snow also starts this time of year. Temperatures typically range from .).

Winter is a very cloudy and cool wet time of year, with frequent wind and frosts. Sometimes, winter thaws occur, and the town may go multiple days above the freezing mark, which melts much of the snow. That usually happens when a strong storm is approaching from the west. Lake effect snow lasts for most of the winter and causes huge amounts of snow to fall in the region. Temperatures at this time of year typically range from .).

==Government==
The mayor is Yvonne Hamlin, who was elected in October 2022.

Collingwood is within the Simcoe—Grey riding for both federal and provincial elections. The federal Member of Parliament is Conservative Terry Dowdall, and the Member of Provincial Parliament is Jim Wilson who sits as an independent.

==Neighbourhoods==
===Collingwood Heritage Conservation District===
The Collingwood Heritage Conservation District was formally recognized in the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 2002-12-02.
Collingwood was the first municipality in Canada to have a Heritage Conservation District added to the register.

The area, which surrounds the town&#x27;s downtown core
contains 260 properties and several landmarks, including the Shipyards redevelopment on former site of Collingwood Shipbuilding, Collingwood Terminals grain elevator,
and the town hall.

===Creative Simcoe Street===
The portion of Simcoe Street that lies within the Collingwood Heritage Conservation District
is informally known as Creative Simcoe Street. The neighbourhood is home to several artist&#x27;s studios, art galleries and restaurants. It also includes the Collingwood Museum and Collingwood Public Library, the historic Tremont House building, as well as the Simcoe Street Theatre, which is managed by the Town of Collingwood Department of Parks, Recreation, and Culture.

The two-block stretch of Simcoe Street intersects the main street, Hurontario Street, to the West, connecting the neighbourhood to the Collingwood downtown. It ends at St. Paul Street to the East, at the Eastern border of the Heritage Conservation District.

The Creative Simcoe Street name is used by local media,
businesses
and tourism groups
however, the neighbourhood is not formally recognized by the Town.

==Transportation==

Collingwood is served by Highway 26, which runs along the shore of Nottawasaga Bay, and county road 124 (which was part of Highway 24 before the provincial government downgraded that portion of the highway in 1998). The town is also served by a rail trail along the former Barrie Collingwood Railway section of what had been the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railway, connecting Collingwood to the towns of Owen Sound and Barrie, with a spur heading north through the town&#x27;s central business district, to the large grain elevators at the downtown wharf, where trains would load and unload onto ships.

Colltrans is the Town of Collingwood&#x27;s local public transit system. Simcoe County LINX, the region&#x27;s inter-community transit service, serves stops at downtown Collingwood, the Collingwood Hospital, and Collingwood Collegiate Institute, connecting the town to cities like Barrie, where it is possible to connect to inter-regional services such as GO Transit and Ontario Northland.

In addition to Collingwood&#x27;s position as a lake port, it is also served by Collingwood Airport (CNY3), a medium-sized airport about south of the town.

<text>Ante Šercer (21 April 1896, Požega, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia – 25 June 1968, Zagreb) was a Yugoslav physician.

He attended elementary school in Dubrovnik. Finishing medical studies in Graz (Austria) and Prague (Czech Republic), he soon attended the specialized courses in Othorinolaringology (otolaryngology) in Zagreb, Vienna, and again, in Prague. He started practising at the clinical hospital of the Medical Department (&quot;Medicinski fakultet&quot;) in Zagreb in 1920, and eventually became its administrator and an associate professor. Later, in 1946, he became head of the department of the othorinolaringology of the Sisters of Charity Hospital (&quot;Bolnica Sestara Milosrdnica&quot;). 

Due to his efforts, and those of Eduard Miloslavić, the Medical Faculty was created in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1944 with eight lecturers. At that time, he also advocated opening the Center for Oriental Studies there. The University of Zagreb provided 15 t of material and other equipment and books needed for 180 students in that first year. Due to that effort, when World War II ended, academician Šercer was sentenced by the newly created government of Yugoslavia to one year of forced labor and the confiscation of the property, found guilty of supporting the NDH.

Šercer published 170 scientific papers, among which outstanding places belong to his works in the field of otolaryngological propaedeutics and clinical treatment, plastic surgery of the nose and ear, oral surgery and tonsilar problems. His method of presenting the infrastructure of the nose through decortication gained world attention. He was among the first in Europe to treat otosclerosis by surgery and worked out a special theory about the etiopathogenesis of this illness. He initiated and was the editor in chief of a Croatian &quot;medical Encyclopedia&quot;, which was one of the first books of that kind in the world.

Among the famous people he treated were the Jazz musician Louis Armstrong (&quot;Satchmo&quot;) and opera stars including Mario del Monaco and Giuseppe di Stefano.

<text>David Dawes (born 3 December 1964), is one of the founders of the XFree86 project. He was one of four people who started it in 1992 (together with David Wexelblat, Glenn Lai, and Jim Tsillas), and became the project president in 1994.

The XFree86 Project used the MIT/X11 license until 2004, when Dawes, as the XFree86 president, decided to license XFree86 4.4 under the newly devised XFree86 License 1.1. The new license includes a &quot;credit clause&quot; similar to the old BSD License advertising clause. The Free Software Foundation determined that the new license was incompatible with the version 2 of GNU GPL. The move was protested by free software leaders such as Richard Stallman and Theo de Raadt.

While Dawes explained this as an attempt to make sure the XFree86 developers get their due credit (apparently in response to the &quot;Xouvert&quot; fork), the decision was contested in the XFree86 community, notably by Jim Gettys and Keith Packard, and the dissenters subsequently forked the project into the X.Org Server. The fork superseded XFree86, as other projects found the new license unacceptable.

Dawes still heads the XFree86 Project and maintains XFree86 without corporate sponsorships; however, the last release of the software was in 2008. Dawes also runs his own small private company called X-Oz Technologies, which provides project management and consulting services.

<doc id="472592" wikidata="Q2738156" url="?curid=472592" title="Jumanji (picture book)">
<text>Jumanji is a 1981 fantasy children&#x27;s picture book written and illustrated by American author Chris Van Allsburg. The book is about an enchanted board game that incorporates wild animals and other jungle elements as the game is played in real life. The book was adapted into a 1995 film of the same name and spawned a franchise that includes three sequels and an animated series.

A sequel to the book, entitled &quot;Zathura&quot;, was released in 2002.

==Storyline==
While their parents are out for the day, Judy and Peter Shepherd, after playing with some toys, become bored and decide to go to the park. There, they find a safari-themed board game called &quot;Jumanji&quot;. Taking the game home, they find a warning message: &quot;Do not begin unless you intend to finish.&quot; Ignoring the warning, they start to play.

The pair soon discovers that any dangers encountered in the game spring to life somewhere in the house. For example, when Peter rolls on a lion, an actual lion appears, which Judy and Peter trap in their mother&#x27;s bedroom. Judy rolls on a stampede of rhinos, Peter rolls on a monsoon, and Judy rolls on an explorer—each of which appears in real life to wreak havoc in the house. Nevertheless, they continue to play, hoping that if they finish the game, everything will go back to normal. The game finally ends when Judy wins and yells the name of the game.

In an instant, everything is back to normal. The siblings rush back to the park before their parents return, and replace the game where they had found it. The story ends when Judy and Peter look outside and see their neighbors, Danny and Walter Budwing, who (according to their mother) never bother to finish games they play nor read the instructions, excitedly returning from the park with &quot;Jumanji&quot; in their hands.

==Development==
Van Allsburg declared that he often thinks of combining incongruous images to evoke a feeling of &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot;, coming up with the idea of wild animals in a living room. Combining that with twisting how board games often rely on the player&#x27;s imagination, he &quot;wondered what it&#x27;d be like to play a board game that didn&#x27;t require any imagination&quot; because the events actually happened, conceiving a jungle adventure game &quot;in which the game came to life. And all the pictures that I wanted to draw would actually be manifestations of gameplay.&quot; The name &quot;Jumanji&quot; was a meaningless name that came to him as he tried to conceive &quot;something slightly exotic and something that evoked the idea of the jungle&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Jumanji&quot;, a 1995 film based on the story, is an adaptation of the picture book. The film has adult characters who did not appear in the original story: Alan Parrish (Robin Williams/Adam Hann-Byrd), Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt/Laura Bell Bundy), Officer Carl Bentley (David Alan Grier), Aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth), and big-game hunter Van Pelt (Jonathan Hyde, who also portrayed Alan&#x27;s father, Sam Parrish). Not only is Alan Parrish the main protagonist instead of Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce), but a background story is added, in which the game trapped Alan in the jungle many years earlier while he and Sarah were playing back in 1969. Unlike the original story, the animals wreak havoc on the town, and Peter turns into a monkey for cheating in the game. In the film the snake is absent and crocodiles appear in the scene where Sarah summons the monsoon. 

The &quot;Jumanji&quot; animated TV series, roughly based on the book and the film, ran from 1996 to 1999. Unlike in the book and film, the game transports Judy and Peter to the jungle after taking turns and reading a clue instead of releasing all of the jungle elements, and there are other villains besides Van Pelt, such as a merchant named Trader Slick and a scientist named Professor Ibsen. In a few episodes, Peter transforms into various animals while trying to cheat. Alan Parrish from the film remains trapped in the game until the final episode, while Danny and Walter from the original book are absent. Unlike in the film, Sarah Whittle does not appear. Van Pelt does not leave the jungle as he did in the film, but still hunts Alan. In the show, Alan is sucked into &quot;Jumanji&quot; in 1972 rather than 1969. The show includes a tribe of masks called the Manjis led by Tribal Bob. 

In 2011, Robin Williams recorded an audiobook for the book&#x27;s thirtieth-anniversary edition.

&quot;&quot; is a 2017 film starring Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan. Though explicitly a sequel, it is more of an action adventure than the 1995 film.

&quot;&quot; is a 2019 sequel to the 2017 film, which returns stars Johnson, Black, Hart, and Gillan. Awkwafina, Rory McCann, Danny Glover, and Danny DeVito join the cast.

==Sequel==
&quot;Zathura&quot; (published in 2002) is a sequel to &quot;Jumanji&quot; also written by Van Allsburg. In the book, Danny and Walter Budwing (who appear at the end of &quot;Jumanji&quot;) find a science fiction board game whose elements similarly come to life. It was adapted to the film &quot;&quot; in 2005.

<text>Jean-Paul Riopelle, (October 7, 1923 – March 12, 2002) was a Canadian painter and sculptor from Quebec. He had one of the longest and most important international careers of the sixteen signatories of the &quot;Refus Global&quot;, the 1948 manifesto that announced the Quebecois artistic community&#x27;s refusal of clericalism and provincialism. He is best known for his abstract painting style, in particular his &quot;mosaic&quot; works of the 1950s when he famously abandoned the paintbrush, using only a palette knife to apply paint to canvas, giving his works a distinctive sculptural quality. He became the first Canadian painter since James Wilson Morrice to attain widespread international recognition and high praise, both during his career and after his death. He was a leading artist of French Lyrical Abstraction.

==Biography==
Born in Montreal, Riopelle began drawing lessons in 1933 and continued through 1938. His parents encouraged his interest in art and allowed the young Riopelle to take classes with Henri Bisson (1900–1973), who taught drawing and painting out of his home on weekends. Bisson was a well-known artist and educator in Montreal at the time and was responsible for a number of public monuments that still exist today. Riopelle studied engineering, architecture and photography at the École polytechnique de Montréal in 1941. In 1942 he enrolled at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal but shifted his studies to the less academic École du meuble, graduating in 1945.
He studied under Paul-Émile Borduas in the 1940s and was a member of Les Automatistes, a group of Montreal artists who were interested in Surrealist techniques, particularly automatic drawing with its embrace of the imagination and creativity born out of the unconscious mind. Breaking with traditional conventions in 1945 after reading André Breton&#x27;s &quot;Le Surréalisme et la Peinture&quot;, he began experimenting with non-objective (or non-representational) painting. He was one of the signers of the &quot;Refus global&quot; manifesto. In 1947 Riopelle moved to Paris and continued his career as an artist, where, after a brief association with the surrealists (he was the only Canadian to exhibit with them at the landmark exhibition &quot;International Exhibition of Surrealism&quot; at Galerie Maeght in 1947) and to sign Breton&#x27;s manifesto the &quot;Rupture inaugurale&quot;) he capitalized on his image as a &quot;wild Canadian&quot;. His first solo exhibition took place in 1949 at the Surrealist meeting place, &quot;Galerie La Dragonne&quot; (later known as the Galerie Nina Dausset) in Paris. In 1953, he signed with Pierre Loeb of Galerie Pierre which led to his work being included in the Guggenheim exhibition &quot;Younger European Artists&quot; the same year.

Riopelle married Françoise Lespérance in 1946; the couple had two daughters but separated in 1953. In 1959, he began a relationship with the American painter Joan Mitchell. Living together throughout the 1960s, they kept separate homes and studios near Giverny, where Monet had lived. They influenced one another greatly, as much intellectually as artistically, a facet of their art which has been explored by an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2018. Their association was a stormy one, fuelled by alcohol, which ended in 1979. His 1992 painting &quot;Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg&quot; is Riopelle&#x27;s tribute to Mitchell, who died that year, and is regarded as a high point of his later work.

==Work==
Riopelle&#x27;s style in the 1940s changed quickly from Surrealism to Lyrical Abstraction (related to abstract expressionism), in which he used myriad tumultuous cubes and triangles of multicolored elements, facetted with a palette knife, spatula, or trowel, on often large canvases to create an overall sense of movement.

The presence of long filaments of paint in his painting from 1948 through the early 1950s has often been seen as resulting from a dripping technique like that of Jackson Pollock. Rather, the creation of such effects came from the act of throwing, with a palette knife or brush or directly from the paint tube, large quantities of paint onto the stretched canvas (positioned vertically).

Riopelle&#x27;s voluminous impasto became just as important as color. His oil painting technique allowed him to paint thick layers, producing peaks and troughs as copious amounts of paint were applied to the surface of the canvas. Riopelle, though, claimed that the heavy impasto was unintentional: &quot;When I begin a painting,&quot; he said, &quot;I always hope to complete it in a few strokes, starting with the first colours I daub down anywhere and anyhow. But it never works, so I add more, without realizing it. I have never wanted to paint thickly, paint tubes are much too expensive. But one way or another, the painting has to be done. When I learn how to paint better, I will paint less thickly.&quot; This aspect of the &quot;unintentional&quot; is in keeping with Riopelle&#x27;s interest in Surrealism and using &quot;absolute chance&quot; to create art.
When Riopelle started painting, he would attempt to finish the work in one session, preparing all the color he needed beforehand: &quot;I would even go as far to say—obviously I don&#x27;t use a palette, but the idea of a palette or a selection of colors that is not &quot;mine&quot; makes me uncomfortable, because when I work, I can&#x27;t waste my time searching for them. It has to work right away.&quot;

A third element, &quot;range of gloss&quot;, in addition to color and volume, plays a crucial role in Riopelle&#x27;s oil paintings. Paints are juxtaposed so that light is reflected off the surface not just in different directions but with varying intensity, depending on the naturally occurring gloss finish (he did not varnish his paintings). These three elements; &quot;color&quot;, &quot;volume&quot;, and &quot;range of gloss&quot;, would form the basis of his oil painting technique throughout his long and prolific career.

Riopelle received an Honorable Mention at the 1952 São Paulo Art Biennial. In 1953 he showed at the &quot;Younger European Painters&quot; exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The following year Riopelle began exhibiting at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York. In 1954, works by Riopelle, along with those of B. C. Binning and Paul-Émile Borduas represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. He was the sole artist representing Canada at the 1962 Venice Biennale in an exhibit curated by Charles Comfort.
Riopelle received an Honorable Mention at the Guggenheim Museum’s &quot;Guggenheim International Award&quot; exhibition in 1958 and a major retrospective of his work was held at the Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. Subsequent retrospectives of Riopelle&#x27;s work were held at the National Gallery of Canada in 1963, a smaller exhibition at the Musée du Québec in 1967, at the Fondation Maeght (Saint Paul-de-Vence, France) in 1971, and at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1972. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.
After diversifying his means of expression during the 1960s (turning to ink on paper, watercolours, lithography, collage and oils), he experimented with sculptural installations, including a fountain in Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, called &quot;La joute&quot;. In 1972 he returned to Québec and built a studio at Sainte-Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson. He discovered the glacial landscapes of the Far North, inspiring in the black and white &quot;Icebergs&quot; series of 1977 and 1978. A large retrospective of Riopelle&#x27;s work was held in 1981 at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, in Paris, then traveled to the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec and Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal (1981-1982). This exhibit also travelled to the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City, the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Caracas, Venezuela in Caracas.

While expressing more representational subject matter in the 1980s, he abandoned traditional painting methods in favor of aerosol spray cans. In 1981 he became the first signatory of the Refus Global manifesto to be awarded the prestigious Prix Paul-Émile-Borduas. His painting &quot;Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg&quot; (1992, Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec), done after her death, is a tribute to love and to life, to the American painter Joan Mitchell who was his companion for 25 years and is a narrative sequence of 30 tableaux, integrated into a triptych measuring more than 40 meters in length. In 1974, he began to travel to the Quebec Laurentians, to a studio and home at Ste. Marguerite he designed and had built and Sainte-Cyr-en-Arthies, France. He lived his last years at Isle-aux-Grues, an isolated island situated in the St. Lawrence River.

Riopelle was arguably one of the most important Canadian artists of the 20th century, establishing his reputation in the burgeoning postwar art scene of Paris, where his entourage included André Breton, Sam Francis and Samuel Beckett. Riopelle produced over six thousand works (of which he produced more than two thousand paintings) during the course of his lifetime.

===Art market===
On May 24, 2017, Riopelle&#x27;s painting &quot;Vent du nord&quot; sold at the Heffel Fine Art Auction House spring auction for $7,438,750 (CAD) (including buyer&#x27;s premium), the second-highest price to date for a Canadian work of art. Heffel holds the current record for Riopelle&#x27;s work.

==Relocation of &quot;La Joute&quot;==
Riopelle&#x27;s 1969 work &quot;La Joute&quot; was originally located in the Parc Olympique, in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of Montreal. Despite popular belief, the work is not an homage to hockey (in French a &quot;joute de hockey,&quot; wherein the wrongful attribution lies), but is actually referring to the game &quot;capture the flag&quot;. A menagerie of animals and mythological figures are caught up in the game, encircling a central structure that Riopelle called the &quot;Tower of Life&quot;. Its relocation to the La Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle during the redevelopment of the Quartier international de Montréal in 2003 provoked controversy and outrage from residents of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who claimed that moving it from the Parc Olympique deprived it of the context required for its full meaning as an homage to sport.

Those who supported the move, including the Quebec government, Riopelle&#x27;s heirs, and the artwork&#x27;s owner the Musée d&#x27;art contemporain de Montréal, argued that moving it would allow a proper homage to Riopelle, and that it would allow the work to be more widely seen and exhibited as the artist intended, whereas its previous location had been inaccessible and had not included the fountain or fire elements Riopelle designed. In addition, the artist felt that the commercial venues around Parc Olympic trivialized the art.

==Theft and Destruction of &quot;La Défaite&quot;==
On August 1, 2011, Riopelle&#x27;s sculpture &quot;La Défaite&quot; was stolen from its pedestal in Esterel, QC, where it had been on display since 1963. The sculpture was found the next day in a wooded area, broken into four pieces.

==Legacy==
Riopelle represented Canada at the 1962 Venice Biennale. In 1969 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, and began to spend more time in Canada. He was specially recognized by UNESCO for his work. One of his largest compositions, &quot;Point de rencontre&quot;, was originally intended for the Toronto airport, but is at Rideau Hall on loan from France&#x27;s Centre national des arts plastiques until 2024. In 1988 he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 1994. In 2000 Riopelle was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

In June, 2006 the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts organized a retrospective exhibition which was presented at the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia and the Musée Cantini in Marseilles, France. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts has a number of his works, spanning his entire career, in their permanent collection. In 2020, his indigenously inspired paintings were gathered in the travelling exhibition &quot;Riopelle: The Call of Northern Landscapes and Indigenous Cultures&quot; by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition explores Riopelle&#x27;s interest in non-Western art, as sparked by his &quot;friend and collector Georges Duthuit and the writings of anthropologists and ethnologists, such as Marius Barbeau, Jean Malaurie and Claude Lévi-Strauss&quot;. In 2021, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, Quebec City announced that it will build a pavilion dedicated to Riopelle&#x27;s work, &quot;Espace Riopelle&quot;.

A set of postage stamps depicting portions of Riopelle&#x27;s painting &quot;L&#x27;Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg&quot; was issued by Canada Post on Oct. 7, 2003.

In 2023, on Riopelle&#x27;s 100th birthday, a major retrospective &quot;Riopelle: Crossroads in Time&quot;, was organized by the National Gallery of Canada. The Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne at the Centre Pompidou in Paris hosted a major exhibition of Riopelle&#x27;s work and the Royal Canadian Mint issued two special commemorative gold coins featuring Riopelle imagery.

<text>An almshouse (also known as a bede-house, poorhouse, or hospital) is charitable housing provided to people in a particular community, especially during the Middle Ages. They were often targeted at the poor of a locality, at those from certain forms of previous employment, or their widows, and at elderly people who could no longer pay rent, and are generally maintained by a charity or the trustees of a bequest. &quot;Alms&quot; are, in the Christian tradition, money or services donated to support the poor and indigent. Almshouses were originally formed as extensions of the church system and were later adapted by local officials and authorities.

==History==
Many almshouses are European Christian institutions though some are secular. Almshouses provide subsidised accommodation, often integrated with social care resources such as wardens.

===England===

Almshouses were established from the 10th century in Britain, to provide a place of residence for poor, old, and distressed people. They were sometimes called bede-houses, and the residents were bedesmen or bedeswomen. &quot;Bede&quot; is the Anglo-Saxon word for prayer, and the almsmen and women were obliged to pray for the founder of the charity. The first recorded almshouse was founded in York by King Athelstan; the oldest still in existence is the Hospital of St. Cross in Winchester, dating to about 1132. In the Middle Ages, the majority of European hospitals functioned as almshouses. Many of the medieval almshouses in England were established with the aim of benefiting the soul of the founder or their family, and they usually incorporated a chapel. As a result, most were regarded as chantries and were dissolved during the Reformation under the Abolition of Chantries Acts of 1545 and 1547.

The legal basis for civil almshouses and workhouses in England was the Act for the Relief of the Poor. These institutions underwent various population, program, and name changes, but by 1900, the elderly made up 85 percent of the residents of these institutions.

Almshouses generally have charitable status and aim to support the continued independence of their residents. There is an important delineation between almshouses and other forms of sheltered housing in that almshouse residents generally have no security of tenure, being solely dependent upon the goodwill of the administering trustees.

Some 2,600 almshouses continue to be operated in the UK, providing 30,000 dwellings for 36,000 people.

===Netherlands===
Almshouses were first founded in Holland in the Middle Ages. Usually founded by rich citizens or guilds, these almshouses &quot;constituted a well-organized system of relief&quot;.

A number of are still functioning as accommodation for elderly people. Most residents are women.

===Norway===
In 1269 or 1270, an almshouse was established in Stavanger, the first known in Norway.

===United States===
The English tradition of almshouses was introduced to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by its founder, William Penn. The Maryland legislature created almshouses in Anne Arundel County, financed by property taxes on landowners throughout the state. Massachusetts also had a long tradition of almshouses. In the United States, aid tended to be limited to the elderly and disabled, and children had to sleep in the same rooms as adults.

The first almshouse in United States history was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1622. The original Boston Almshouse was burned down in 1682 and was rebuilt away from the heart of Boston nearly a decade later.

In 1884, the statistical analysis of the Massachusetts almshouses showed four in the city of Boston and 225 almshouses throughout the state. These almshouses housed nearly 7,000 people. Of these residents, 700 were believed to have a mental illness. Half of these almshouses did not house children.

Upon entering the almshouses in Connecticut, patients were whipped ten times. There were similar institutions developed from 1725 to 1773 in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and New York. At the Pennsylvania Hospital, some &quot;lunatics&quot; were chained to a cellar wall or made to wear a primitive straitjacket.
Before the American Civil War, local officials regulated almshouses and did not ensure the people inside them were being cared for in the proper way or given the time they needed for help. It was not until the 1860s that more progressive states such as New York began to create boards that regulated, inspected, and reported on almshouses.

The Newark almshouse opened in September 1878 as a branch of the Syracuse State School. It was located on 104 acres of land within the town of Newark, New Jersey, and held around 853 patients. The nine dormitory buildings that housed the patients were able to hold anywhere from 45 to 130 people. There was also a small hospital within the almshouse that could hold up to 30 patients. There were not many employees, only about 110, to take care of the hundreds of young women admitted to the almshouse. Patients were committed to the Newark State School by superintendents of the poor as well as judges who declared them insane or feeble-minded in court.

Many of the patients of the New York Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women were falsely considered to be mentally ill. Mary Lake was the daughter of a young woman who had been sentenced to 10 years in a state prison. Mary and her other siblings were split up and put into almshouses. She was committed to the almshouse in Newark as feeble-minded. It was not until years later that she was pronounced not mentally ill and was able to leave the almshouse.

Throughout the 19th century almshouses were a last resort for those who were poor, disabled, and elderly. Residents experienced mistreatment, destitution, and inhumanity. As almshouses continued into the 19th century, activists such as Dorothea Dix fought for institutional reform. Dix sought to remove children, the mentally ill, and the developmentally disabled from all almshouses and increase the number of institutions, hospitals, and asylums for them to reside in. As her movement gained momentum, she played a vital role in the establishment and expansion of over 30 hospitals for the treatment of the mentally ill. Her efforts removed specific groups from almshouses, leaving the elderly to remain.

One of the biggest problems with almshouses is that they were rarely self-sustaining. They were costly to run, and the capacity of the inmates to pay for their own keep by working at the farm, or working at the almshouse itself, was greatly overestimated. There were not enough staff, facilities were not kept up, and the poor kept coming. By the end of the 1800s, almshouses began to be replaced by asylums and institutions.

==Description of layout==

Almshouses are often multiple small terraced houses or apartments providing accommodation for small numbers of residents. The units may be constructed in a &quot;U&quot; shape around a communal courtyard. Some facilities included a chapel for religious worship.

The Bakewell Almshouses in Derbyshire, England – dating from 1709 – were six separate homes, hence the six front doors visible today. Each home had one tiny room downstairs and one upstairs, with no bathroom, toilet or kitchen. The Manners family, Dukes of Rutland from 1703, maintained the building until 1920. They gave it and the adjacent former town hall to the trustees who had been running the charity. The town hall was sold at a 1966 auction for £1,137. Financial problems caused the homes to become derelict and unfit for habitation by 2001. They were rescued and restored by the trustees in 2004–2006 at a cost of £325,000, which was raised through donations and grants. They are now three larger homes, combining modern facilities with many historical features.

==In literature==
The most famous almshouse in literature is probably Hiram&#x27;s Hospital, the centrepiece of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;The Warden&quot;, which is also featured in the sequel &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;.

<text>Makhachkala, previously known as Petrovskoye (1844–1857) and Port-Petrovsk (1857–1921), or by the local Kumyk name of Anji, is the capital and largest city of Dagestan, Russia. The city is located on the Caspian Sea, covering an area of , with a population of over 623,254 residents, while the urban agglomeration covers over , with a population of roughly 1 million residents. Makhachkala is the fourth-largest city in the Caucasus, the largest city in the North Caucasus and the North Caucasian Federal District, as well as the third-largest city on the Caspian Sea. The city is extremely ethnically diverse, with a minor ethnic Russian population.

The city&#x27;s historic predecessor is the port town of Anji (Andzhi), which was located in Kumykia, and which was a part of possessions of Tarki state, the capital of Kumyks known from the 8th century.

The city was named &quot;Petrovskoye&quot; after Peter the Great. After gaining city status in 1857, the Petrovskoye fortress was renamed &quot;Petrovsk-Port&quot;. After the Russian Revolution, Petrovsk-Port was renamed Makhachkala on May 14, 1921, after Bolshevik revolutionary . On the same day, it became capital of the newly formed Dagestan ASSR. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city became the capital of the Republic of Dagestan.

Makhachkala is an important economic, educational, scientific, and cultural centre of the North Caucasus. The city is a major Russian seaport on the Caspian Sea, and a transport hub. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Russia, and is currently going through a construction boom.

==History==
===Early history===
Makhachkala&#x27;s historic predecessors were the towns of Tarki and Anji (or Andzhi, or Anji-kala), dating their history, according to some sources, back to Khazar times. Some chronicles suggest that it was the name of a citadel of Khazarian capital of Semender, which was called Anji-kala. 

During the first Muslim conquests of Dagestan, it was exposed to an influx of Muslims. During the reign of Umayyad Caliph Hisham b. Abdülmelik (724-743), the caliph&#x27;s brother Maslama succeeded in establishing Islamic dominance in the region with his conquests. In the following years, one of the Umayyad commanders, Marwan b. Mohammed also organized successful raids to Dagestan. However, the Islamic domination in the region ended in 796 (180 AH) when the Khazars captured Derbend. In the early days of the Abbasids, the struggle against the Khazars continued. This struggle, which lasted for two centuries, ended with the victory of the Muslim Arabs. In 815, Sheikh Abu Ishaq and Sheikh Mohammed al-Kindi entered Dagestan with a volunteer army of about 2000 people and tried to spread Islam. In the second half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks took a part of the region under their control. Dagestan was invaded by the Mongols in 1222. The Cumans (Kipchaks), who ruled in the north of the Black Sea and the Caucasus, played an important role in the Turkification of the region. Later on, the Ilkhanids, Golden Horde Khanate, Timurids, Shirvanshahs and Safavids dominated Dagestan respectively. Dagestan came under Ottoman rule between 1578 and 1606.

The Safavids started operations to spread Shiism in Dagestan at the beginning of the 19th century but were met with fierce resistance of Dagestanis. Shah Abbas II established a significant influence in Dagestan in 1639. It started to attract the attention of the Russians from the 17th century onwards. It remained the scene of a struggle for influence between Iranians, Russians and Ottomans from the beginning of the 17th century.

When the Safavids began to lose their power at the beginning of the 17th century, the people of Dagestan united under the leadership of Çolak Surhay Khan of the Gazikumukh Khanate, and they won a victory against Iran in 1712. In order to continue their success, he took the people of Dagestan, who asked for help from the Ottoman administration, under his protection by sending gifts to the sultans of the Sublime Porte.

Although the Russians could not hold on to the interior of Dagestan, they expanded their sovereignty towards the Caspian coast and could only be stopped in front of Baku with the help of the Ottoman forces under the command of Mustafa Pasha. With a treaty signed between Russia and Iran in 1724, Derbend, Baku and some other places in the region were left to Russia. As a result of his struggles against the Russians, Nadir Shah captured the south of Dagestan, Derbend and Baku with the Rasht Treaty signed in 1732, and some lands between the Sulak and Kura (Kür) rivers with the 1735 treaty. After 1747, the Russians regained influence in Dagestan.

===19th century===
In the 1840s, after Russian Empire seized the Kumyk plateau, Anji-kala became the place where fort Petrovskoye was founded. A town status was granted to the fortress in 1857. The Russian name of the city was Petrovskoye ()—after the Russian Tsar Peter the Great, who waged war in the region in 1722 during his Persian Campaign. However, among the local Kumyks the city was still known as Anzhi-Qala, &quot;The Pearl Fortress&quot; (&quot;Qala&quot; means fortress or a city with walls, while &quot;Anzhi / Inzhi / Inji&quot; means pearl in Kumyk). There is also still a hill called Anji-arqa, meaning &quot;the hill of Anji&quot;.

After gaining town status in 1857, the Petrovskoye fortress was renamed Petrovsk-Port (), sometimes simply Petrovsk.

In 1894, a railway line linked the city to Vladikavkaz (in present-day North Ossetia-Alania) and Baku (in present-day Azerbaijan). However, despite the development, a report from 1904 detailed the spread of malaria and unsuitable drinking water in the city.

===20th century===
In January 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the British No. 221 Squadron Royal Air Force based themselves at Petrovsk. In March they were joined by No. 266 Squadron and both squadrons were involved in bombing operations against Bolshevik forces in Astrakhan and elsewhere. In August 1919 both squadrons were withdrawn from Petrovsk. The city was invaded by the Red Army in March 1920.

As part of the Soviet revolution, place names relating to monarchy or religion were changed, and thus on 14 May 1921, Petrovsk was renamed Makhachkala, after Dagestani revolutionary Magomed-Ali &#x27;Makhach&#x27; Dakhadaev. On the same day, it became capital of the newly formed Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The city incurred major damage during an earthquake on 14 May 1970. The city was briefly renamed &quot;Shamilkala&quot; during the disintegration of the Soviet Union in honor of the Dagestani freedom fighter Imam Shamil.

The area was used as a Soviet-era naval testing station, leaving behind a curious sea fort off nearby Kaspiysk ().

On 12 April 1944, a decision was made to resettle the inhabitants of Kumyk villages of Tarki, Kyakhulay and Alburikent, which owned the surrounding areas, to the settlements of the deported Chechens. Most of the released land was distributed to the Makhachkala city council (6243 out of 8166 hectares), in addition to the collective farms of the mountainous regions and industrial enterprises of Makhachkala.

After the return of the Kumyk population in 1957, the lands of the collective farms were not restored, personal property was also lost, many houses were occupied by people resettled from mountainous areas. The historical monuments of the ancient city were destroyed and used as construction materials for the infrastructure of Makhachkala.

===21st century===
Makhachkala is close to areas of fighting and therefore it and the surrounding region has a heavy security service presence. On 25 November 2011, a protest took place in Makhachkala attended by up to 3,000 people demanding an end to illegal activities perpetrated by the security services.

On December 15, 2011, Gadzhimurat Kamalov, a Russian investigative journalist and founder of the independent Chernovik newspaper was shot dead in an apparent assassination.

A report of the International Crisis Group from 2013 describes the city as being &quot;a city of almost one million and gained spectacular economic resources due to a construction boom, skyrocketing land prices, substantial federal funds for reconstruction, infrastructure, transport, housing, courts and administrative services. But even a short visit revealed acute problems, including dirty streets, dilapidated buildings, inadequate utilities, hectic construction, lack of planning and poorly organised public transport&quot;.

On 14 August 2023, a fire at a gas station in Makhachkala led to a series of explosions, causing at least 25 deaths and 66 injuries.

On the evening of 29 October 2023, antisemitic riots occurred at the Makhachkala airport causing 500 police officers of the MVD to temporarily close the airport until the morning of 30 October 2023.

On 23 June 2024, unknown attackers carried out a terrorist attack in Makhachkala. Many people were killed and wounded. A priest was murdered, and a church and a synagogue burned.

==Economy==
The most important industrial sector is the oil refineries, as well as mechanical engineering and textile factories. Numerous administrative and educational institutions are based in the city, including a regional research centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences with around 20 research departments. The city is also the media centre of the region. Numerous newspapers are published in Makhachkala, including Dagestanskaya Pravda and the Islamic As-Salam. In addition, several regional television stations are based in the city.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eight urban-type settlements and six rural localities, incorporated as the City of Makhachkala—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Makhachkala is incorporated as Makhachkala Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===

For the purposes of administration, the city is divided into three city districts, from west to east: Kirovsky, Sovetsky and Leninsky. In May 2015, these three city districts were granted municipal status.

===Symbols===
The coat of arms and flag of Makhachkala were adopted on December 15, 2006. The coat of arms shows the city&#x27;s historic fortress in silver on a red field, with flames coming from either tower and a solar symbol above. It is supported by a golden eagle on each side, a crown on top, and crossed anchors (representing its maritime history) entangled with grapevines at the bottom.
In proportions of 2:3, the flag displays the main shield of the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

==Demographics==

The population of Makhachkala includes (2021 Census data):
* Avar nations (25.6%)
* Kumyks (18.9%)
* Dargin nations (15.5%)
* Lezgins (13.9%)
* Laks (11.8%)
* Russians (5.9%)
* Tabasarans (2.3%)
* Rutuls (1.2%)
* Nogais (1.0%)
* Aghuls (1.0%)

==Transportation==

The city is served by Uytash Airport, a regional airport providing connections to other Russian cities. Russian Railways via the North Caucasus Railway provides freight and passenger traffic to and from Makhachkala.

The Caspian Sea International Port handles crude oil, petroleum, construction materials, grain, cargo and timber and operates 24 hours a day. The port offers communications with the rest of Russia, as well as with Belarus, Ukraine, the Baltic states, Iran, Turkey and Central Asia. A railyard at the port connects the port to the North Caucasus Railway network.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s main football team, FC Dynamo Makhachkala, currently plays in the Russian Premier League. They play in the 15,200 Dynamo Stadium.

FC Anzhi Makhachkala, the city&#x27;s former top team, played at Dynamo Stadium before moving to Anzhi Arena. Anzhi were purchased by Dagestani commodities billionaire Suleyman Kerimov in 2011, whose investments allowed the club to sign players such as Brazilian World Cup winner Roberto Carlos and Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto&#x27;o who, during his time at the club, became the world&#x27;s highest paid player. The club lived its golden era, finished in the Top 5 for two consecutive seasons (2011-12 and 2012-13) and qualified for the UEFA Europa League, reaching the round of 16 on both occasions. However, after 2013, due to unrest in the region, the players moved to live and train in Moscow, while the local matches in Makhachkala were guarded by armed patrols. This situation, followed by severe budget cuts, made the club lose most of its key players, going on to finish bottom of the table in the 2013–14 season, and later folding in 2022 after having fallen to the third division.

Many well-known mixed martial artists train in Makhachkala, including UFC Lightweight champions Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev.

==Climate==
Makhachkala has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) with warm, relatively dry summers and, cool relatively moist winters. The strong rain shadow of the Caucasus and the ability of the Siberian High to freely move westwards from its source in the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaus makes the climate quite dry, although frequently overcast throughout the winter, which is owing to the relatively low latitude and nearness to the Caspian Sea very mild by Russian standards. Summers are sunnier but also dry as the region is exposed to steep descending vertical velocity from the Indian monsoon, and the greatest rainfall occurs in the autumn season from September to November. October 1987 with has been the wettest month, whilst no precipitation occurred in February 1958, October 1974 and April 1986.

The coldest month since records began in 1882 has been February 1929 with a mean monthly temperature of , whilst the hottest have been July 2010 and August 2014 with means of each, although August 9, 2017, is the hottest day, reaching .

<doc id="472601" wikidata="Q1421611" url="?curid=472601" title="Throggs Neck">
<text>Throggs Neck (also known as Throgs Neck) is a neighborhood and peninsula in the south-eastern portion of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by the East River and Long Island Sound to the south and east, Westchester Creek on the west, and Baisley Avenue and the Bruckner Expressway on the north.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 10, and its ZIP Code is 10465. Throggs Neck is patrolled by the 45th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==Geography==
Throggs Neck is a narrow spit of land in the south-eastern portion of the borough of the Bronx in New York City. It demarcates the passage between the East River (an estuary) and Long Island Sound. &quot;Throggs Neck&quot; is also the name of the neighborhood of the peninsula, bounded on the north by Baisley Avenue and the Bruckner Expressway, on the west by Westchester Creek, and on the other sides by the River and the Sound.

The neighborhood is at the northern approach to the Throgs Neck Bridge, which connects the Bronx with the neighborhood of Bay Terrace in the borough of Queens on Long Island. The Throgs Neck Lighthouse formerly stood at its southern tip. 
The northern approach to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge is also within the Throggs Neck area. The large Ferry Point Park is divided by the Bronx/Whitestone Bridge into a west side made of soccer and cricket fields, NY Ferry stop‚ and a east side featuring a promenade, golf course and waterfront restaurant.

==Name==
Originating from the surname &quot;Throckmorton&quot;, the spelling of the area has been historically variable, with a mix of spellings with one &quot;G&quot; or two, with the traditional spelling being with two Gs. There is an urban legend that during development of the bridge that would bear the neighborhood&#x27;s name, NYC Parks Commissioner and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Chairman Robert Moses officially shortened it to one G after deciding that two would not fit on many of the street signs, though many long-time residents continue to use the traditional spelling.

==History==

The peninsula was called &quot;Vriedelandt&quot;, &quot;Land of Peace&quot;, by the New Netherlanders. The current name comes from John Throckmorton, English immigrant and associate of Roger Williams in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Dutch allowed Throckmorton to settle in this peripheral area of New Amsterdam in 1642, with thirty-five others. At this time, the peninsula was also known as Maxson&#x27;s point as the Maxson family (Richard, Rebecca, John, etc.) lived there. Many of the settlers, including Anne Hutchinson and her family, were murdered in a 1643 uprising of Native Americans. Throckmorton returned to Rhode Island. In 1668, the peninsula appeared on maps as &quot;Frockes Neck&quot;. The peninsula was virtually an island at high tide.

In 1776, George Washington&#x27;s headquarters wrote of a potential British landing at &quot;Frogs Neck&quot;. At the bridge over Westchester Creek, now represented by an unobtrusive steel and concrete span at East Tremont Avenue near Westchester Avenue, General Howe did make an unsuccessful effort to cut off Washington&#x27;s troops in October 1776; when the British approached, the Americans ripped up the plank bridge and opened a heavy fire that forced Howe to withdraw and change his plans; six days later he landed troops at Rodman&#x27;s Neck to the north, on the far side of Eastchester Bay. A farm in the area owned by the Stephenson family was sold in 1795 to Abijah Hammond, who built a large mansion (later the offices of the Silver Beach Garden Corporation).

In the 19th century, the area remained the site of large farms, converted into estates. In about 1848, members of the Morris family purchased a large parcel of land there. They built two mansions and many cottages and service buildings. The Morris estates had a private dock in Morris Cove, at the end of what is now Emerson Avenue, where they had nearly a mile of shoreline. After the Civil War, Collis P. Huntington, the railroad builder, owned an extensive parcel, which his heirs held until they were almost the last estate on Throggs Neck. Huntington&#x27;s property was previously owned by Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr., a sugar magnate, and the Havemeyer-Huntington mansion is now home to Preston High School, New York.

Throgs Neck Park, a public park that faces Throggs Neck from the opposite shore at the end of Myers Street, was acquired as a public place in 1836. From 1833 to 1856, the construction of Fort Schuyler brought in laborers and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrants from Ireland, to settle in the area with their families. By the late 19th century, the area had developed into a fashionable but more public summer resort, which also contained large German beer gardens, to which the residents of Yorkville arrived by steamboat service up the East River. The 19th-century steamboat landing at Ferris Dock on Westchester Creek stood at present-day Brush Avenue north of Wenner Place; the road to it bore the name of the steamboat &quot;Osseo&quot;. The Ferris family were 18th-century residents, whose Ferris Point at the south-east corner of the Throggs Neck neighborhood now supports the Hutchinson River Parkway (formerly Ferris Lane) overhead ramp to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and Ferry Point Park.

In the decades after the 1898 incorporation of the Bronx into the City of Greater New York, transit lines were extended to the neighborhood, bringing in many Italian farmers and tradesmen. In the 1920s the large estates largely became converted into smaller row homes and densely built bungalow lots. The Peters and Sorgenfrel families formed Silver Beach Garden (named for the color of the beach at low tide), a summer colony of bungalows that were later adapted for year-round use; most of the streets were named for flowers and trees found on the Hammond estate. Residents owned their houses but rented the land when they joined to buy it. Nearby to the north, a campsite for church youth transformed into a bungalow colony later named Edgewater Park.

In 1932, Fort Schuyler closed as an active military installation and became the campus for cadets of the State University of New York Maritime College. A 1929–39 pair of plans to expand the subway system with a Second Avenue Subway branch to Throggs Neck did not come to pass. By 1961, with the construction of the Throggs Neck Bridge, as well as the adjacent parkways, the neighborhood lost its comparative isolation. However, Throggs Neck was largely exempt from the severe urban decay that affected much of the Bronx in the 1970s.

The last two of several large and handsome 18th-century Ferris houses in the neighborhood lasted until the 1960s, when the James Ferris house overlooking Eastchester Bay was hastily demolished in 1962 and the Watson Ferris house was demolished in 1964 by its occupants, the Tremont Terrace Moravian Church. The James Ferris house had been commandeered by Admiral Richard Howe as his headquarters in October 1776, when James Ferris was sent to the prison hulks in New York harbor, where he died in 1780.

==Demographics==
The neighborhood has several beach clubs and a diverse housing stock, including middle-class homes, up-market waterfront condominiums, as well as the Throggs Neck Houses, built in 1953 as one of the first low-income public housing projects in New York City and later expanded twice. In 1984, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described Throggs Neck as one of the last middle- and upper-middle-class areas in the Bronx, noting the area &quot;seems like a well-kept suburb&quot;. Even in the mid-1980s, after the city failed to pave neighborhood streets properly, waterfront condominiums were selling for as much as $416,468 in 2005 dollars. As of the 2000 Census, the median household income for census tracts within the neighborhood ranged from $18,000 to $85,000 in the less affluent tracts and well over $100,000 for the waterfront tracts near the Throgs Neck Bridge.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Schuylerville, Throgs Neck, and Edgewater Park was 44,167, a change of 455 (1%) from the 43,712 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 46.1% (20,348) White, 7.9% (3,479) African American, 0.2% (93) Native American, 3.2% (1,430) Asian, 0% (15) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (238) from other races, and 1% (450) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 41% (18,114) of the population.

<text>Depressants, colloquially known as &quot;downers&quot; or central nervous system (CNS) depressants, are drugs that lower neurotransmission levels, decrease the electrical activity of brain cells, or reduce arousal or stimulation in various areas of the brain. Some specific depressants do influence mood, either positively (e.g., opioids) or negatively, but depressants often have no clear impact on mood (e.g., most anticonvulsants). In contrast, stimulants, or &quot;uppers&quot;, increase mental alertness, making stimulants the opposite drug class from depressants. Antidepressants are defined by their effect on mood, not on general brain activity, so they form an orthogonal category of drugs. 

Depressants are closely related to sedatives as a category of drugs, with significant overlap. The terms may sometimes be used interchangeably or may be used in somewhat different contexts.

Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and illicit substances. Alcohol is a very prominent depressant. When depressants are used, effects often include ataxia, anxiolysis, pain relief, sedation or somnolence, cognitive or memory impairment, as well as, in some instances, euphoria, dissociation, muscle relaxation, lowered blood pressure or heart rate, respiratory depression, and anticonvulsant effects. Depressants sometimes also act to produce anesthesia. Other depressants can include drugs like Xanax (a benzodiazepine) and a number of opioids. Gabapentinoids like gabapentin and pregabalin are depressants and have anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects. Most anticonvulsants, like lamotrigine and phenytoin, are depressants. Carbamates, such as meprobamate, are depressants that are similar to barbiturates. Anesthetics are generally depressants; examples include ketamine and propofol.

Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of GABA and inhibition of glutamatergic or monoaminergic activity. Other examples are chemicals that modify the electrical signaling inside the body, the most prominent of which are bromides and channel blockers:)

== Indications ==
Depressants are used medicinally to relieve the following symptoms and disorders:
* Anxiety disorders such as:
** Generalized anxiety
** Social anxiety
** Panic attacks
* Insomnia
* Seizures
* Convulsions
* Depression
* Pain

== Types ==
=== Alcohol ===

An alcoholic beverage is a drink that contains alcohol (known formally as ethanol), an anesthetic that has been used as a psychoactive drug for several millennia. Ethanol is the oldest recreational drug still used by humans. Ethanol can cause alcohol intoxication when consumed. Alcoholic beverages are divided into three general classes for taxation and regulation of production: beers, wines, and spirits (distilled beverages). They are legally consumed in most countries around the world. More than 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption.

The most common way to measure intoxication for legal or medical purposes is through blood alcohol content (also called blood alcohol concentration or blood alcohol level). It is usually expressed as a percentage of alcohol in the blood in units of mass of alcohol per volume of blood, or mass of alcohol per mass of blood, depending on the country. For instance, in North America, a blood alcohol content of 0.10 g/dL means that there are 0.10 g of alcohol for every dL of blood (i.e., mass per volume is used there).

=== Barbiturates ===
Barbiturates were once popular treatments for insomnia, anxiety, and seizures, although their popularity has waned in recent decades. Barbiturates are sometimes used recreationally; they cause dependence and severe withdrawal, and they have a high risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. By the late 1950s, concerns over the mounting social costs associated with barbiturates prompted a concerted effort to find alternative medications. Most people still using barbiturates today do so for the prevention of seizures or, in mild form, for relief from the symptoms of migraines. One barbiturate that remains in use for seizure disorders is phenobarbital.

=== Benzodiazepines ===
A benzodiazepine (sometimes colloquially &quot;benzo&quot;; often abbreviated &quot;BZD&quot;) is a drug whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring. The first such drug, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche, which has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam (Valium) since 1963.

Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. High doses of shorter-acting benzodiazepines induce anterograde amnesia, which may be helpful for surgical and procedural anesthesia to reduce patient recall. Midazolam is often used in anesthesiology. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal, and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures. Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.

In general, benzodiazepines are safe and effective in the short term, although cognitive impairments and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of patients react to benzodiazepines with paradoxical agitation. Long-term use is controversial due to adverse psychological and cognitive effects, decreasing effectiveness, dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, following withdrawal after long-term use. The elderly are at an increased risk of experiencing both short- and long-term adverse effects.

There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioral effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be overdosed and cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are much less toxic than their predecessors, barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken; however, when combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other addictive drugs. In addition, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List, which is significant in clinical practice.

===Cannabis===
Cannabis is often considered either in its own unique category or as a mild psychedelic. The chemical compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is found in cannabis, has many depressant effects, such as muscle relaxation, sedation, decreased alertness, and tiredness. Contrary to the previous statement, activation of the CB1 receptor by cannabinoids causes an inhibition of GABA, the exact opposite of what CNS depressants do.

=== Carbamates ===

Carbamates are a class of depressants, or &quot;tranquilizers&quot;, that are synthesized from urea. Carbamates have anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, antihypertensive, and analgesic effects. They have other uses, like muscle tremors, agitation, and alcohol withdrawal. Their muscle relaxant effects are useful for strains, sprains, and muscle injuries combined with rest, physical therapy, and other measures. The effects, synthesis, and mechanism of action of carbamates are very similar to those of barbiturates. There are many different types of carbamates: some only produce anxiolytic and hypnotic effects, while others only have anticonvulsant effects.

Side effects of carbamates include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, liver failure, poor coordination, nystagmus, abuse, dizziness, weakness, nervousness, euphoria, overstimulation, and dependence. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, embryo-fetal toxicity, stupor, and coma. It is not recommended to use most carbamates, like carisoprodol, for a long time, as physical and psychological dependence do occur.

Meprobamate was launched in 1955. It quickly became the first popular psychotropic drug in America, becoming popular in Hollywood and gaining fame for its seemingly miraculous effects. It has since been marketed under more than 100 trade names, including Amepromat, Quivet, and Zirpon. Carisoprodol, which metabolizes into meprobamate and is still used mainly for its muscle relaxant effects, can potentially be abused. Its mechanism of action is very similar to that of barbiturates, alcohol, methaqualone, and benzodiazepines. Carisoprodol allosterically modulates and directly activates the human α1β2γ2 GABAAR (GABAA) in the central nervous system, similar to barbiturates. This causes chloride channels to open, allowing chloride to flood into the neuron. This slows down communication between neurons and the nervous system. Unlike benzodiazepines, which increase the frequency of the chloride channel opening, carisoprodol increases the duration of channel opening when GABA is bound. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, which causes its depressant effects.

Carbamates are fatal in overdose, which is why many have been replaced with benzodiazepines. Symptoms are similar to a barbiturate overdose and typically include difficulty thinking, poor coordination, decreased levels of consciousness, and a decreased effort to breathe (respiratory depression). An overdose is more likely to be fatal when mixed with another depressant that suppresses breathing.

Physical and psychological dependence does happen with long-term use of carbamates, particularly carisoprodol. Today, carisoprodol is only used in the short term for muscle pain, particularly back pain. Discontinuation after long-term use could be very intense and even possibly fatal. Withdrawal can resemble barbiturate, alcohol, or benzodiazepine withdrawal, as they all have a similar mechanism of action. Discontinuation symptoms include confusion, disorientation, delirium, hallucinations (auditory and visual), insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, pressured speech, tremor, tachycardia, and seizures, which could be fatal.

Carbamates gained widespread use in the 1950s, alongside barbiturates. While their popularity has gradually waned due to concerns over overdose and dependence potential, newer derivatives of carbamates continue to be developed. Among these is Felbamate, an anticonvulsant that was approved in 1993 and is commonly used today. It is a GABAA positive allosteric modulator and blocks the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Other carbamates block sodium channels. Phenprobamate was used as an anxiolytic and is still sometimes used in Europe for general anesthesia and for treating muscle cramps and spasticity. Methocarbamol is a popular drug that is commonly known as Robaxin and is over-the-counter in some countries. It is a carbamate with muscle relaxant effects. Tetrabamate is a controversial drug that is a combination of febarbamate, difebarbamate, and phenobarbital. It is marketed in Europe and has been largely, but not completely, discontinued. On 4 April 1997, after over 30 years of use due to reports of hepatitis and acute liver failure, the use of the drug was restricted. Carisoprodol, known as &quot;Soma&quot;, is still commonly used today for its muscle relaxant effects. It is also very commonly abused around the world. It is a Schedule IV substance in the United States.

===Gabapentinoids===
Gabapentinoids are a unique and relatively novel class of depressants that selectively bind to the auxiliary α2δ subunit (CACNA2D1 and CACNA2D2) site of certain VDCCs and thereby act as inhibitors of α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels. α2δ is nicknamed the &quot;gabapentin receptor&quot;. At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VDCCs are normally closed. They are activated (opened) at depolarized membrane potentials, which is the source of the &quot;voltage-gated&quot; epithet. Gabapentinoids bind to the α1 and α2 sites of the α2δ subunit family. Gabapentin is the prototypical gabapentinoid. The α2δ is found on L-type calcium channels, N-type calcium channels, P/Q-type calcium channels, and R-type calcium channels throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. α2δ is located on presynaptic neurons and affects calcium channel trafficking and kinetics, initiates extracellular signaling cascades and gene expression, and promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin 1. Gabapentinoids are not direct channel blockers; rather, they disrupt the regulatory function of α2δ and its interactions with other proteins. Most of the effects of gabapentinoids are mediated by the high-voltage activated N and P/Q-type calcium channels. P/Q-type calcium channels are mainly found in the cerebellum (Purkinje neurons), which may be responsible for the ataxic adverse effect of gabapentinoids, while N-type calcium channels are located throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. N-type calcium channels are mainly responsible for the analgesic effects of gabapentinoids. Ziconotide, a non-gabapentinoid ω-conotoxin peptide, binds to the N-type calcium channels and has analgesic effects 1000 times stronger than morphine. Gabapentinoids are selective for the α2δ site but non-selective when they bind to the calcium channel complex. They act on the α2δ site to lower the release of many excitatory and pro-nociceptive neurochemicals, including glutamate, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and more.

Gabapentinoids are absorbed from the intestines mainly by the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, SLC7A5) and the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3). They are one of the few drugs that use these amino acid transporters. Gabapentinoids are structurally similar to the branched-chain amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, both of which also bind to the α2δ site. Branched-chain amino acids like l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine have many functions in the central nervous system. They modify large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transport at the blood–brain barrier and reduce the synthesis of neurotransmitters derived from aromatic amino acids, notably serotonin from tryptophan and catecholamines from tyrosine and phenylalanine. This may be relevant to the pharmacology of gabapentinoids.

Gabapentin was designed by researchers at Parke-Davis to be an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA that could more easily cross the blood–brain barrier and was first described in 1975 by Satzinger and Hartenstein. Gabapentin was first approved for epilepsy, mainly as an add-on treatment for partial seizures. Gabapentinoids are GABA analogues, but they do not bind to the GABA receptors, convert into GABA or another GABA receptor agonist &quot;in vivo&quot;, or directly modulate GABA transport or metabolism. Phenibut and baclofen, two structurally related compounds, are exceptions, as they mainly act on the GABA B receptor. Gabapentin, but not pregabalin, has been found to activate voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNQ), which might potentiate its depressant qualities. Despite this, gabapentinoids mimic GABA activity by inhibiting neurotransmission. Gabapentinoids prevent delivery of the calcium channels to the cell membrane and disrupt interactions of α2δ with NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, neurexins, and thrombospondins. Some calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine class are used for hypertension to weakly block α2δ.

Gabapentinoids have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, antiallodynic, antinociceptive, and possibly muscle relaxant properties. Pregabalin and gabapentin are used in epilepsy, mainly partial seizures (focal). Gabapentinoids are not effective for generalized seizures. They are also used for postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Pregabalin and gabapentin have many off-label uses, including insomnia, alcohol and opioid withdrawal, smoking cessation, social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic pain, hot flashes, tinnitus, migraines, and more. Baclofen is primarily used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Phenibut is used in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia to treat anxiety and improve sleep, as in the treatment of insomnia. It is also used for various other indications, including the treatment of asthenia, depression, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, stuttering, tics, vestibular disorders, Ménière&#x27;s disease, dizziness, and the prevention of motion sickness and anxiety before or after surgical procedures or painful diagnostic tests. Phenibut, like other GABA B agonists, is also sometimes used by bodybuilders to increase the human growth hormone.

Reuters reported on 25 March 2010 that &quot;Pfizer Inc violated a United States racketeering law by improperly promoting the epilepsy drug Neurontin (gabapentin). Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the penalty is automatically tripled, so the finding will cost Pfizer $141 million.&quot; The case stems from a claim from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. that &quot;it was misled into believing Neurontin was effective for off-label treatment of migraines, bipolar disorder and other conditions. Pfizer argued that Kaiser physicians &quot;still recommend the drug for those uses&quot; and that &quot;the insurer&#x27;s website also still lists Neurontin as a drug for neuropathic pain.&quot;

In some cases, gabapentinoids are abused and provide similar effects to alcohol, benzodiazepines, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). The FDA placed a black box warning on Neurontin (gabapentin) and Lyrica (pregabalin) for serious breathing problems. Mixing gabapentinoids with opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB, alcohol, or any other depressant is potentially deadly.

Common side effects of gabapentinoids include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, increased appetite, urinary retention, shortness of breath, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), memory issues, uncontrollable jerking motions, auditory hallucinations, erectile dysfunction, and myoclonic seizures.

An overdose of gabapentinoids usually consists of severe drowsiness, severe ataxia, blurred vision, slurred speech, severe uncontrollable jerking motions, and anxiety. Like most anticonvulsants, pregabalin and gabapentin have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Gabapentinoids, like all calcium channel blockers, are known to cause angioedema. Taking them with an ACE inhibitor can increase the toxic effects of gabapentinoids. They may also enhance the fluid-retaining effect of certain anti-diabetic agents (thiazolidinediones). It is not known if they cause gingival enlargement like other calcium channel blockers. Gabapentinoids are excreted by the kidney, mostly in their original form. Gabapentinoids can build up in the body when someone has renal failure. This usually presents itself as myoclonus and an altered mental state. It is unclear if it is safe to use gabapentinoids during pregnancy, with some studies showing potential harm.

Physical or physiological dependence does occur during the long-term use of gabapentinoids. Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin and gabapentin, people report withdrawal symptoms like insomnia, headache, nausea, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, anxiety, depression, pain, hyperhidrosis, seizures, psychomotor agitation, confusion, disorientation, and gastrointestinal complaints. Acute withdrawal from baclofen and phenibut may also cause auditory and visual hallucinations, as well as acute psychosis. Baclofen withdrawal can be more intense if it is administered intrathecally or for long periods of time. If baclofen or phenibut is used for long periods of time, it can resemble intense benzodiazepine, GHB, or alcohol withdrawal. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, baclofen or phenibut should be tapered down slowly. Abrupt withdrawal from phenibut or baclofen could possibly be life-threatening because of its mechanism of action. Abrupt withdrawal can cause rebound seizures and severe agitation.

=== Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid ===
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or &quot;GHB&quot;, is a GABA analogue that is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and depressant drug. It is also naturally found in small amounts in some alcoholic beverages alongside ethanol. GHB is the prototypical substance among a couple of GHB receptor modulators.

GHB has been used as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. The sodium salt of GHB, sodium oxybate, is commonly used today for narcolepsy, sudden muscle weakness, and excessive daytime sleepiness. It is sold under the brand name Xyrem.

As a depressant, GHB would worsen narcolepsy and muscle weakness. But in low doses, GHB mainly affects the GHB receptor, an excitatory receptor that releases dopamine and glutamate, giving GHB stimulant effects, the opposite of a depressant. But in large doses, GHB activates the GABAB receptor, an inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system, which overpowers the excitatory effects, thus causing central nervous system depression. Some antipsychotics are agonists of the GHB receptor.

GHB can usually be found in either sodium, potassium, magnesium, or calcium salts. Xywav is a medication that is a mixture of all GHB salts and is used to treat the same conditions as Xyrem. Both Xywav and Xyrem are Schedule III and have a black box warning for central nervous system depressant effects (hypoventilation and bradycardia) and for their very high potential for abuse. Overdose on GHB is fatal with or without mixing other CNS depressants. Death from a GHB overdose is usually caused by respiratory depression, seizures, or coma.

GHB is used illegally as an intoxicant, an aphrodisiac, and an athletic-performance enhancer. It is a popular club drug in some parts of the world due to its powerful aphrodisiac and euphoric effects. Similarly to phenibut and baclofen, it is used by bodybuilders to increase the human growth hormone due to GABAB activation. It has also been reportedly used as a date-rape drug. This caused it to be a Schedule I substance in the United States, Canada, and other countries. Xyrem, which is GHB in its sodium form, is Schedule III in the United States, Canada, and other countries.

In low doses, GHB mainly binds to the GHB receptor and weakly binds to the GABAB receptor. The GHB receptor is an excitatory G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Its endogenous ligand is GHB, since GHB is also a neurotransmitter. It is also a transporter for vitamin B2. The existence of a specific GHB receptor was predicted by observing the action of GHB and related compounds that primarily act on the GABAB receptor but also exhibit a range of effects that were found not to be produced by GABAB activity and so were suspected of being produced by a novel and, at the time, unidentified receptor target. At higher doses, seizures are very common. This is thought to be mediated through an increased Na+/K+ current and the increased release of dopamine and glutamate. GHB can also cause absence seizures; the mechanism is currently not known but it is believed to be due to interactions with the GABAB receptor. It is being investigated if endogenous GHB is responsible for non-convulsive seizures in humans.

GHB withdrawal is very intense. Physical dependence develops quickly. It is also highly psychologically addictive. It shares some similarities with the withdrawal of gabapentinoids phenibut and baclofen due to the activation of the GABAB receptor. It features a typical depressant withdrawal syndrome that mimics alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms include delirium, tremor, anxiety, tachycardia, insomnia, hypertension, confusion, sweating, severe agitation which may require restraint, auditory and visual hallucinations, and possibly death from tonic-clonic seizures.

Baclofen and phenibut are very effective for withdrawal and are preferred by patients over benzodiazepines for treatment of withdrawal.

&quot;Some GHB receptors modulators only bind to the GHB receptor, while others bind to both the GHB and GABAB receptors.&quot;

=== Nonbenzodiazepines ===

Nonbenzodiazepines, sometimes referred to as Z-drugs, are a class of hypnotic depressants that are mainly used to treat insomnia and sometimes anxiety. They are structurally related to benzodiazepines. They positively modulate the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, the chief inhibitory receptor of the central nervous system, just like benzodiazepines, but at a molecular level, they are structurally unrelated.

Nonbenzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine at the GABAA receptor site to keep the chloride channel open. This causes chloride in the intercellular area to flood into the neuron. Since chloride has a negative charge, it causes the neuron to rest and cease firing. This results in a relaxing and depressant effect on the central nervous system.

Common nonbenzodiazepines like Zolpidem and Zopiclone are extremely effective for insomnia but carry many risks and side effects. Sleeping pills, including zopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death.

Adverse reactions are as follows: &quot;taste disturbance (some report a metallic-like taste); less commonly, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache; rarely, amnesia, confusion, depression, hallucinations, nightmares; very rarely, lightheadedness, incoordination, paradoxical effects, and sleep-walking are also reported.&quot; Some users of nonbenzodiazepines have sleepwalked and committed murders or have been involved in motor vehicle accidents. Unlike benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines have a risk of hallucinations and sleepwalking. Like benzodiazepines, they can cause anterograde amnesia.

Nonbenzodiazepines should not be discontinued abruptly if taken for more than a few weeks due to the risk of rebound withdrawal effects and acute withdrawal reactions, which may resemble those seen during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Treatment usually entails gradually reducing the dosage over a period of weeks or several months, depending on the individual, dosage, and length of time the drug has been taken. If this approach fails, a crossover to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine (such as chlordiazepoxide or, more preferably, diazepam) can be tried, followed by a gradual reduction in dosage. In extreme cases and, in particular, where severe addiction and/or abuse are manifested, inpatient detoxification may be required, with flumazenil as a possible detoxification tool.

=== Opioids/opiates ===

Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to reduce pain. Medically, they are primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia. Opioids also cause euphoria and are highly abused.

Opioids and opiates are not the same. Opiates refer to natural opioids such as morphine and codeine. Opioids refer to all natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic opioids, like heroin and oxycodone.

Contrary to popular misconception, opioids are not depressants in the classical sense. They do produce central nervous system depression, but they also excite certain areas of the central nervous system. To remain true to the term &quot;depressant&quot;, opioids cannot be classified as such. For opioid agonists and opium derivatives, these are classified differently. These drugs are more correctly identified as &quot;analgesic&quot; or &quot;narcotic&quot;. However, they do have depressant actions nonetheless.

There are three principal classes of opioid receptors: μ, κ, δ (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and include the ε, ι, λ, and ζ (epsilon, iota, lambda, and zeta) receptors. Conversely, σ (sigma) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist naloxone. The nociception opioid peptide receptor (NOP) (ORL1) is an opioid receptor that is involved in pain responses, anxiety, movement, reward, hunger, memory, and much more. It plays a major role in the development of tolerance to μ-opioid agonists.

When &quot;pain&quot; occurs, a signal gets sent from the site of possible injury. This signal goes up the spinal cord into the brain, where it is perceived as a negative emotion known as nociception or &quot;hurt&quot;. In the central nervous system, the spine is connected to the brain by a structure called the brain stem. The brain stem is the first part of the brain that develops in a mammal out of the neural crest. It is also the oldest part of the brain and controls many automatic functions such as consciousness, breathing, heart rate, digestion, and many more. Opioid receptors are specialized pain-blocking receptors. They bind a wide range of hormones, peptides, and much more. Although they are found everywhere in the central nervous system, they are highly concentrated in the brain stem. Depending on the receptor, activation of them has the ability to stop pain from making its way to the brain and being perceived as pain. Hence, opioids do not actually &quot;stop&quot; pain; they simply stop you from knowing you are in pain. Pain and the ability to modify it based on an organism&#x27;s environment is an evolutionary advantage, and it has been shown that it can help an organism escape and survive certain situations where they may otherwise be immobilized due to pain and injury. The midbrain nuclei of the brain stem, with structures like the periaqueductal gray, reticular formation, and rostromedial tegmental nucleus, are responsible for the majority of the physical and psychological effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids.

The μ-opioid receptor is responsible for the analgesic, euphoric, and adverse effects of opioids. The μ-opioid receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor. When the μ-opioid receptor is activated, it causes pain relief, euphoria, constipation, constricted pupils, itching, and nausea. The μ-opioid is located in the gastrointestinal tract, which controls peristalsis. This causes constipation, which can be extremely problematic and distressing. Activation of this receptor also causes relaxation of voluntary and involuntary muscles, which can cause side effects like trouble urinating and swallowing. The μ-opioid receptor can also reduce androgens, thus decreasing libido and sexual function. The receptor is also known to cause &quot;musical anhedonia&quot;.

The receptor plays a critical role in feeding. The palatability of food is determined by opioid receptor-related processes in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. The opioid processes involve mu opioid receptors and are present in the rostromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens on its spiny neurons. This area has been called the &quot;opioid eating site&quot;.

The μ-opioid receptor has many endogenous ligands, including endorphin.

The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is a G protein-coupled receptor located in the central nervous system. KOR is also a G protein-coupled receptor. Humans and some other primates have a higher density of kappa receptors than most other animals. KOR is responsible for nociception, consciousness, motor control, and mood. Dysregulation of this receptor system has been implicated in alcohol and drug addiction. The endogenous ligand for KOR is dynorphin. The activation of KOR usually causes dysphoria, hence the name dynorphin. The intoxicating plant &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot; contains salvinorin A, an alkaloid that is a potent and selective κ-opioid receptor agonist. This causes powerful hallucinations. Antagonizing the κ-opioid receptor may be able to treat depression, anxiety, stress, addiction, and alcoholism.

The third receptor is the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). The delta receptor is the least studied of the three main opioid receptors. It is a G protein-coupled receptor, and its endogenous ligand is deltorphin. The activation of DOR may have antidepressant effects. δ-opioid agonists can produce respiratory depression at very high doses; at lower doses, they have the opposite effect. High doses of a δ-opioid agonist can cause seizures, although not all delta agonists produce this effect. Activation of the delta receptor is usually stimulating instead of sedating like most opioids.

The nociception opioid peptide receptor (NOP) is involved in the regulation of numerous brain activities, particularly instinctive emotional behaviors and pain. NOP is a G protein-coupled receptor. The nociception receptor controls a wide range of biological functions, including nociception, food intake, memory processes, cardiovascular and renal functions, spontaneous locomotor activity, gastrointestinal motility, anxiety, and the control of neurotransmitter release at peripheral and central sites.

An opioid overdose is fatal. A person overdosing on opioids or opiates is presented with respiratory depression, a lethal condition that can cause hypoxia from slow and shallow breathing. Mixing opioids with another depressant, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, increases the chance of an overdose and respiratory depression. Opioid overdose causes a decreased level of consciousness, pinpoint pupils, and respiratory depression. Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms. Opioids activate μ-opioid receptors in specific regions of the central nervous system associated with respiratory regulation. They activate μ-opioid receptors in the medulla and pons. They are located in the brain stem, which connects to the spine. This area has a high density of μ-opioid receptors as they block pain going up from the spine into the brain. These areas are the oldest and most primitive parts of the brain. They control automatic functions such as breathing and digestion. Opioids stop this process and cause respiratory depression and constipation. The brain stem no longer detects carbon dioxide in the blood, so it does not initiate the inhalation reflex, usually resulting in hypoxia. Some overdose victims, however, die from cardiovascular failure or asphyxiation from choking on their vomit.

Naloxone is a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, meaning instead of activating the μ-opioid receptor, it disrupts the functioning of the receptor. Since naloxone is powerful and highly selective for the μ-opioid receptor, it can knock powerful opioids like fentanyl off the receptor and block another ligand from binding to the receptor, thus stopping an overdose. A person dependent on opioids may go into precipitated withdrawal when naloxone is used. Since naloxone blocks any endogenous or exogenous opioids from binding to the μ-opioid receptor. This may cause a person to immediately go into withdrawal after naloxone is used. This can cause withdrawal symptoms like cold sweats and diarrhea.

Opioids activate μ-opioid receptors in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). The rostromedial tegmental nucleus is a GABAergic nucleus that functions as a &quot;master brake&quot; for the midbrain dopamine system. The RMTg possesses robust functional and structural links to the dopamine pathways. Opioids decrease the release of GABA, thus disinhibiting the GABAergic brake on dopamine networks. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning it either blocks or decreases the potential of neuron firing. This causes large amounts of dopamine to be released, as it is no longer blocked by GABA. Disinhibition of GABA may be responsible for causing seizures, an uncommon adverse effect of opioids. GABAergic disinhibition is also why opioids are not considered true depressants. This excitement of dopaminergic pathways causes the euphoria of opioids. This causes major positive reinforcing effects in the brain, instructing it to do it again. The RMTg is also responsible for the development of tolerance and addiction. Psychostimulants also excite this pathway.

Fentanyl is very commonly cut into other substances sold on the street. Fentanyl is used to increase the potency of substances, thus making the user spend more money on the laced substance. Codeine is a weaker natural opiate that is usually used for bronchitis, diarrhea, and post-operative pain. It is very easy to overdose on these substances, especially if the user has no tolerance.

=== Piperidinediones ===
Piperidinediones are a class of depressants that are not used anymore. There are piperidinediones that are used for other purposes, like breast cancer. The piperidinedione class is very structurally similar to barbiturates. Some piperidinediones include glutethimide, methyprylon, pyrithyldione, glutarimide, and aminoglutethimide. The first three (glutethimide, methyprylon, and pyrithyldione) are central nervous depressants. The piperidinedione depressants, specifically glutethimide, are positive modulators of the GABAA anion channel. The drug increases inhibitory GABAergic tone and causes neuro-inhibition of the cortical and limbic systems, observed clinically as a sedative-hypnotic effect. Glutethimide is also a potent inducer of the CYP 2D6 enzyme in the liver. This enzyme is responsible for converting many drugs, from beta blockers to antidepressants to opioids and opiates. Due to its effects on the conversion of opioids, it was highly abused and mixed with opioids like codeine. Codeine must be metabolized to morphine in the liver to have its psychoactive and analgesic effects. Mixing codeine with glutethimide allowed more codeine to be converted into morphine in the body, thus increasing its effect. These were known as &quot;hits&quot;, &quot;cibas and codeine&quot;, and &quot;dors and 4s&quot;. Glutethimide was believed to be safer than barbiturates, but many people died from the drug. Demand was high in the United States at one point. Production of glutethimide was discontinued in the US in 1993 and in several eastern European countries, most notably Hungary, in 2006.

Glutethimide withdrawal is intense and resembles barbiturate withdrawal. It features hallucinations and delirium typical of a depressant withdrawal. In the 1970s, there were reports of neonatal withdrawal from glutethimide. Infants born to mothers addicted to glutethimide responded well initially, then had a recurrence of symptoms about 5 days later, including overactivity, restlessness, tremors, hyperreflexia, hypotonia, vasomotor instability, incessant crying, and general irritability.

Glutethimide withdrawal featured severe agitation, tremors, and seizures, which could be fatal.

=== Quinazolinone ===

Quinazolinones are a class of depressants that are rarely used anymore. Quinazolinones have powerful sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic effects. Quinazolinone&#x27;s structure is very similar to that of some antibiotics. Quinazolinone&#x27;s main mechanism of action is binding to the GABAA receptor. It does not bind to the ethanol, barbiturate, neurosteroid, or benzodiazepine site. Instead, it binds on a site directly between the GABRB2 (β2) and (α1) GABRA1 proteins on the GABAA receptor. The anesthetic etomidate and anticonvulsant loreclezole may also bind to this site.

Overdosing on quinazolinone sometimes causes effects that are the opposite of quinazolinone-like sedation. The overdose consists of hyperreflexia, vomiting, kidney failure, delirium, hypertonia, coma, myoclonic twitches, somnolence, euphoria, muscular hyperactivity, agitated delirium, tachycardia, and tonic-clonic seizures. In 1982, 2,764 people visited US emergency rooms after overdosing on quinazolinones, specifically methaqualone. Mixing quinazolinones with another depressant is possibly fatal. Death from a quinazolinone overdose is usually caused by death through cardiac or respiratory arrest. An overdose resembles a barbiturate or carbamate overdose.

Quinazolinone withdrawal occurs when someone who has become dependent on a quinazolinone ceases usage. Quinazolinone withdrawal resembles ethanol, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, and carbamate withdrawal. It usually consists of restlessness, nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, tachycardia, insomnia, tremor, hallucinations, delirium, confusion, and seizures; and, which are possibly fatal: EEG photoparoxysmal response, myoclonic twitches, fever, muscle spasms, and irritability.

Methaqualone hydrochloride and quinazolinone anxiolytics and hypnotics are referred to as &quot;quaaludes&quot;, &quot;ludes&quot;, and &quot;disco biscuits&quot;. Methaqualone was very commonly abused in the western world during the 1960s and 1970s. Methaqualone was mainly prescribed for insomnia, as it was thought to be safer than barbiturates and carbamates. Methaqualone became highly abused by many, including celebrities, after its introduction in 1965. Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1951 by Indra Kishore Kacker and Syed Husain Zaheer, who were conducting research on finding new antimalarial medications. The drug name &quot;Quaalude&quot; (methaqualone) is a portmanteau, combining the words &quot;quiet interlude&quot;. Methaqualone was discontinued in the United States in 1985, mainly due to its psychological addictiveness, widespread abuse, and illegal recreational use. Nonbenzodiazepines and benzodiazepines are now used to treat insomnia instead. Methaqualone is now a Schedule I substance. Some quinazolinone analogues are still sold online. They come with the risk of seizures.

Large doses of methaqualone can cause euphoria, disinhibition, increased sexuality and sociability, muscle relaxation, anxiolysis, and sedation. Today, methaqualone is widely abused in South Africa. Many celebrities have used quinazolinone, most notably methaqualone. Bill Cosby admitted to casual sex involving the recreational use of methaqualone. 18-year-old actor Anissa Jones died from an overdose of cocaine, PCP, methaqualone, and the barbiturate Seconal. Billy Murcia, a drummer for the rock band New York Dolls, died at 21 when he drowned in a bathtub while overdosing on heroin and methaqualone.

Cloroqualone was a quinazolinone that bound to the GABAA and sigma-1 receptors. It had useful cough suppressant effects and weaker sedative effects than methaqualone, but was ultimately withdrawn due to its potential for abuse and overdose.

Diproqualone is a quinazolinone that is still used today. Diproqualone has sedative, anxiolytic, antihistamine, and analgesic properties, resulting from its agonist activity at the β subtype of the GABAa receptor, antagonist activity at all histamine receptors, inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, and possibly its agonist activity at both the Sigma-1 receptor and Sigma-2 receptor. Diproqualone is used primarily for the treatment of inflammatory pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; it is used more rarely for treating insomnia, anxiety, and neuralgia. Diproqualone is the only analogue of methaqualone that is still in widespread clinical use due to its useful anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, along with the sedative and anxiolytic actions common to other drugs of this class. There are still some concerns about the potential of diproqualone for abuse and overdose; it is sold not as a pure drug but as the camphosulfonate salt in combination mixtures with other medicines such as ethenzamide.

Etaqualone is a quinazolinone-class depressant. It has sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and central nervous system depressant properties. It was highly abused and had a high risk of overdose. Users would snort or smoke the free-base etaqualone hydrochloride salt.

Methylmethaqualone is an analogue of methaqualone with similar hypnotic and sedative effects. Methylmethaqualone differs from methaqualone by 4-methylation on the phenyl ring. It produces convulsions at only slightly above the effective sedative dose. It would appear that this compound was sold on the black market in Germany as a designer drug analogue of methaqualone.

Nitromethaqualone is a quinazolinone depressant with ten times more hypnotic and sedative effects than methaqualone.

Quinazolinones:

* Alfoqualone (Arofuto)
* Cloroqualone
* Diproqualone
* Etaqualone (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone)
* Mebroqualone (MBQ)
* Mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen)
* Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor, Mandrax)
* Methylmethaqualone
* Nitromethaqualone
* SL-164 (Dicloqualone, DCQ)

=== Miscellaneous ===
* Alpha and beta blockers (carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol, etc.)
* Anticholinergics (atropine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine, etc.)
* Anticonvulsants (topiramate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, etc.)
* Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, doxylamine, promethazine, etc.)
* Antipsychotics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, etc.)
* Hypnotics (zolpidem, zopiclone, chloral hydrate, eszopiclone, etc.)
* Muscle relaxants (baclofen, phenibut, carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, etc.)
* Sedatives (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, etc.)

== Combining multiple depressants ==
Combining multiple depressants can be very dangerous because the central nervous system&#x27;s depressive properties have been proposed to increase exponentially instead of linearly. This characteristic makes depressants a common choice for deliberate overdoses in the case of suicide. The use of alcohol or benzodiazepines along with the usual dose of heroin is often the cause of overdose deaths in opiate addicts.

<text>Active matrix is a type of addressing scheme used in flat panel displays. It is a method of switching individual elements of a flat panel display, known as pixels. Each pixel is attached to a transistor and capacitor that &quot;actively&quot; maintain the pixel state while other pixels are being addressed, in contrast with the older passive matrix technology in which each pixel must maintain its state passively, without being driven by circuitry.

Active matrix technology was invented by Bernard J. Lechner at RCA, using MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors). Active matrix technology was first demonstrated as a feasible device using thin-film transistors (TFTs) by T. Peter Brody, Fang Chen Luo and their team at the Thin-Film Devices department of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1974, and the term was introduced into the literature in 1975.

Given an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix, the number of connectors needed to address the display is &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot; (just like in passive matrix technology). Each pixel is attached to a switch-device, which &quot;actively&quot; maintains the pixel state while other pixels are being addressed, also preventing crosstalk from inadvertently changing the state of an unaddressed pixel. The most common switching devices use TFTs, i.e. a FET based on either the cheaper non-crystalline thin-film silicon (a-Si), polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si), or CdSe semiconductor material.

Another variant is to use diodes or resistors, but neither diodes (e.g. metal insulator metal diodes), nor non-linear voltage dependent resistors (i.e. varistors) are currently used with the latter not yet economical, compared to TFT.

The Macintosh Portable (1989) was perhaps the first consumer laptop to employ an active matrix panel. Since the decline of cathode-ray tubes, as a consumer display technology, virtually all TVs, computer monitors and smartphone screens that use LCD or OLED technology employ active matrix technology.

<doc id="472610" wikidata="Q940655" url="?curid=472610" title="UFO (British TV series)">
<text>UFO is a 1970 British science fiction television series about the covert efforts of an international defence organisation (under the auspices of the United Nations) to prevent an alien invasion of Earth. It was created by Gerry Anderson and Sylvia Anderson with Reg Hill, and produced by the Andersons and Lew Grade&#x27;s Century 21 for Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment company.

A single series of 26 episodes (including the pilot) was filmed over the course of more than a year; a five-month production break was caused by the closure of MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, where the show was initially made. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. &quot;UFO&quot; was first broadcast in the UK and Canada from 1970, and in the United States from 1972.

The Andersons&#x27; live-action science fiction movie &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (also known as &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;) is considered an immediate precursor to &quot;UFO&quot;, which was their first entirely live-action TV series. (Their previous shows had used marionettes.) The series featured actors, costumes, props, locations and music that had appeared in the film, and 11 cast members of the film appeared in at least one episode of &quot;UFO&quot;.

Following syndication in the US and initial favourable ratings, a possible second series was planned; initially entitled &quot;UFO 1999&quot;, this eventually became &quot;&quot;, but with a totally different cast from &quot;UFO&quot;.

==Premise==
The series&#x27; premise is that in 1980, Earth is being visited by aliens from a dying planet, who are abducting humans and harvesting their organs for their own bodies. The alien incursions may also be a prelude to a possible full-scale invasion. The series&#x27; main cast of characters are the staff of a secret, high-technology international military agency called &quot;SHADO&quot; (an acronym for &quot;S&quot;upreme &quot;H&quot;eadquarters &quot;A&quot;lien &quot;D&quot;efence &quot;O&quot;rganisation) established by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Germany to defend Earth and humanity against the mysterious aliens and learn more about them, while at the same time keeping the threat of an alien invasion hidden from the public.

Operating under the cover (as well as literally beneath the premises) of the Harlington-Straker Studios movie studio in England, SHADO is headed by Commander Edward Straker (Ed Bishop), a former United States Air Force colonel and astronaut, whose &quot;cover&quot; is his role as the studio&#x27;s chief executive.

SHADO has a variety of high-tech hardware and vehicles at its disposal to implement a layered defence of Earth. Early warnings of alien attack came from SID, the &quot;S&quot;pace &quot;I&quot;ntruder &quot;D&quot;etector, an unmanned computerised tracking satellite that constantly scans for UFO incursions. The forward line of defence is Moonbase from which the three lunar Interceptor spacecraft, that fire a single explosive warhead, are launched. The second line of defence includes Skydiver, a submarine mated with the submersible, undersea-launched Sky One interceptor aircraft, which attacks UFOs in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The last line of defence is ground units including the armed, IFV-like SHADO Mobiles, fitted with caterpillar tracks.

On Earth, SHADO also uses two SHADAIR aircraft, a Seagull X-ray supersonic jet (e.g. in the episode &quot;Identified&quot;) and a transport plane (e.g. in &quot;A Question of Priorities&quot;); a transatlantic Lunar Carrier with a separating Lunar Module (e.g. in &quot;Computer Affair&quot;); a helicopter (actually, a small VTOL aeroplane with large rotating propellers, e.g. in the episode &quot;Ordeal&quot;); and a radio-controlled Space Dumper (e.g. in &quot;The Long Sleep&quot;). The Moonbase has hovercraft-like Moon Hoppers/Moonmobiles that can be deployed for transportation or reconnaissance.

The alien race is never given a proper name, either by themselves or by human beings; they are simply referred to as &quot;the aliens&quot;. They are humanoid in appearance, and the autopsy of the first alien captured reveals that they are harvesting organs from the bodies of abducted humans to prolong their lifespans. However, the later episode &quot;The Cat with Ten Lives&quot; suggests that these &quot;humanoids&quot; are actually beings subject to alien mind control, and one &quot;alien&quot; body recovered was suspected of being completely &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, &quot;possessed&quot; by one of the alien mindsa concept central to the Andersons&#x27; previous Supermarionation series &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;. Their faces are stained green by the hue of a green oxygenated liquid, which is believed to cushion their lungs against the extreme acceleration of interstellar flight; this liquid is contained in their helmets. To protect their eyes, the aliens wear opaque sclera contact lenses with small pinholes for vision. (The show&#x27;s opening titles begin with a shot of one of these contact lenses being removed from an alien&#x27;s eye.) The personal arms of the aliens resemble shiny metal submachine guns; these have a lower rate of fire than those used by SHADO.

The aliens&#x27; spacecraft can readily cross the vast distances between their planet and Earth at many times the speed of light (abbreviated and pronounced as &quot;SOL&quot;; e.g., &quot;SOL one decimal seven&quot; is 1.7 times the speed of light), but are too small to carry more than a few crew members. Their time on station is limited: UFOs can only survive for a couple of days in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere before they deteriorate and finally explode. The UFOs can survive far longer underwater; one episode, &quot;Reflections in the Water&quot;, deals with the discovery of a secret undersea alien base and shows one UFO flying straight out of an extinct volcano. A special underwater version of the standard UFO design is seen in &quot;Sub-Smash&quot;. In flight, they are surrounded by horizontally spinning vanes and emit a distinctive pulsing electronic whine that sounds like a &quot;Shoooe-Wheeeh!&quot; (produced by series composer Barry Gray on an ondes Martenot). The craft is armed with a laser-type weapon, and conventional explosive warheads can destroy it.

==Cast and characters==
&quot;UFO&quot; had a large ensemble cast; many of its members came and went during the course of the series, with some actorssuch as George Sewell and Gabrielle Drakeleaving midway through the series, during the production break necessitated by the change of studio facilities. It is established early on that SHADO personnel rotate between positions, so the occasional disappearance of characterssome of whom later returned in other positionsfits the concept of the series. Also, owing to the scheduling of the series not reflecting the production order, some episodes featuring departed cast members were not broadcast until late in the series, which can give the impression that no major cast changes occurred. Only Ed Bishop appeared in every episode.

===Main characters===
* Colonel Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Straker (Ed Bishop), Commander-in-chief of SHADO, is a former American Air Force colonel, pilot and astronaut originally from Boston, Massachusetts, who organised SHADO following a series of UFO attacks in 1970. Straker masquerades as the head of Harlington-Straker Film Studios, SHADO Headquarters being located directly below the studio.
* Colonel Paul Foster (Michael Billington) is introduced in the second episode &quot;Exposed&quot;. A former test pilot, his plane was critically damaged when SHADO&#x27;s Sky One intercepted and destroyed a UFO flying near Foster&#x27;s jet. His persistent investigation of the incident threatened to expose SHADO&#x27;s existence, so Straker offered him a position with SHADO.
* Lieutenant Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake), seen as Moonbase commander during the first half of the series. Ellis is occasionally portrayed as lacking self-confidence, and at other times as a take-charge officer. She is briefly reassigned to SHADO HQ when it is suggested that she may be romantically involved with interceptor pilot Mark Bradley (&quot;Computer Affair&quot;).
* Colonel Alec Freeman (George Sewell), Second-in-command of SHADO, a former pilot and intelligence officer, is SHADO&#x27;s first officer (and very first operative recruited into SHADO by Straker) for 17 episodes in the series (Sewell left following the change of studios, being later unavailable when series production resumed at Pinewood Studios). Freeman is Straker&#x27;s closest friend and right-hand man and, occasionally, his muscle.
* General James Henderson (Grant Taylor), Straker&#x27;s superior officer, serves as the president of the International Astrophysical Commission, which is a front for SHADO and is responsible for obtaining funds and equipment from various governments to keep SHADO operational. Straker and Henderson clash frequently over the needs of SHADO and economic realities.
* Colonel Virginia Lake (Wanda Ventham) first appears in the opening episode (&quot;Identified&quot;), as the chief designer for Westbrook Electronics, the contractor for the SHADO&#x27;s Utronics faster-than-light tracking system. During the last eight episodes, Lake returned to take over the post of SHADO first officer, replacing Alec Freeman.
* Captain Peter Carlin (Peter Gordeno), during the first third of the series, Carlin is the commander of the submarine Skydiver and pilot of its interceptor aircraft, Sky One. In 1970, Carlin and his sister found a UFO and were attacked; he was shot and wounded and his sister vanished. He joined SHADO in the hope of finding out what happened to his sister, and eventually learned that her organs had been harvested in &quot;Identified&quot;. Gordeno left the show after six episodes because he wanted to avoid typecasting.
* Lieutenant Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez) is one of Straker&#x27;s first recruits into SHADO. Barry works as a space tracker at Moonbase and later replaces Lieutenant Ellis as its commanding officer. She also serves aboard Skydiver in &quot;Sub-Smash&quot;.
* Captain Lew Waterman (Gary Myers) is initially an interceptor pilot on the Moon; he is later promoted to captain, and replaces Peter Carlin as commanding officer of Skydiver and pilot of Sky One.
* Lieutenant Keith Ford (Keith Alexander) is a former television interviewer who became a founding member of SHADO and its main communications officer. Actor Keith Alexander left the series after the production break, so the character disappears at the two-thirds mark of the series.
* Lieutenant Ayshea Johnson (Ayshea Brough) is a SHADO headquarters officer in 14 episodes, and later becomes SHADO&#x27;s communications officer following the departure of Lieutenant Ford.
* Doctor Douglas Jackson (Vladek Sheybal) is the SHADO psychiatrist and science officer. He serves a number of capacities within SHADO, including acting as prosecution officer during the court-martial of Paul Foster. It is implied that &quot;Douglas Jackson&quot; is not the character&#x27;s birth name, as he speaks with a strong Eastern European accent.
* Lieutenant Joan Harrington (Antonia Ellis) another Moonbase operative, was one of the organisation&#x27;s earliest recruits, as seen in &quot;Confetti Check A-O.K.&quot;
* Miss Ealand (Norma Ronald) is a SHADO operative who masquerades as Straker&#x27;s movie studio secretary. She is the first line of defence against anyone entering SHADO HQ via Straker&#x27;s office/elevator. The character is not seen in most of the post-studio change episodes, being replaced in two episodes by Miss Holland, played by Lois Maxwell.
* Lieutenant Mark Bradley (Harry Baird) is a Caribbean-born interceptor pilot based on the Moon. He becomes romantically involved with Lieutenant Ellis for a time, leading to a temporary assignment at SHADO HQ on Earth, and later briefly assumes the position of Moonbase commander. Baird left the series after filming four episodes, but appeared in stock footage in two later episodes.

===Minor characters===
One of the female Moonbase operatives, Joanna, was played by Shakira Baksh, who later married Michael Caine. Producer Gerry Anderson later said that he had lost his temper with her so badly on the set of &quot;UFO&quot; that he always feared the idea of running into Michael Caine at some actors&#x27; function, and being punched on the nose by him.

Interceptor pilot Steve Minto was played by Steven Berkoff. Lieutenant Sylvia Howell, a Skydiver technician, was played by Georgina Moon.

==Episodes==
Owing to the fragmented nature of the ITV network in the UK at the time, the 26 episodes of &quot;UFO&quot; were broadcast out of production order, and every broadcaster showed the episodes in a different sequence. The list below, drawn from Chris Bentley&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Book of Gerry Anderson&#x27;s UFO&quot;, details the running order shown on ATV (in the Midlands).

===List of episodes===
===Alternative viewing orders ===
* Prod: The studio production order.
* ATV: &quot;Official&quot; ITC sequence. This is the sequence in which the episodes were originally scheduled to be broadcast in the UK by ATV Midlands.
* UFO Series: Recommended order by Marc Martin of http://www.ufoseries.com.
* Fanderson: Recommended by Fanderson and used on British DVDs.
* ITC: Order used for VHS release in the UK.

The North American DVD release of the series usually follows the production order, with a few diversions; a website ufoseries.com for the show offers seven possibilities of viewing sequence. According to &quot;The Complete Gerry Anderson&quot;, the episode &quot;Exposed&quot; was intended to be aired second, but it was produced fifth and appears as the fifth episode in the American DVD release. It was only when the entire series was repeated by BBC Two in 1996–1997 that the series was shown in chronological production order in the UK for the first time.

On the website shadolibrary.org, Deborah Rorabaugh has created a timeline of events in chronological order, using a few known dates and facts. For example, &quot;Exposed&quot; should come before all other episodes featuring Paul Foster, and there are a few definitive dates given (two newspaper dates, a death and script date).

==Production==
Following lukewarm ratings for &quot;Joe 90&quot; (1968–1969) and the cancellation of children&#x27;s espionage television series &quot;The Secret Service&quot; (1969) after only 13 episodes, Lew Grade approached Gerry Anderson to look into creating his first live-action TV series. Anderson worked with his wife, Sylvia, and producer Reg Hill to create a science fiction adventure series based on UFOs. Anderson said the core idea for the series was that UFO sightings were a common issue during the late 1960s, and that the idea of aliens harvesting human organs came from the work of Christiaan Barnard and his pioneering transplant operations. The creative team initially envisioned an organisation called UFoeDO (Unidentified Foe Defence Organisation), which was to become the secret SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation).

Many of the props and actors that had appeared in the Anderson-produced 1969 movie &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; were utilised in the series. The creators looked ten years ahead and placed the series in a 1980s future. Sylvia Anderson designed the costumes for the show, including the Moonbase uniforms and purple wigs that female staff wore; the wigs were to become a major reference point for the series.

In addition to the shift from using marionettes to real actors, another key point of difference is that while the Andersons&#x27; previous series were explicitly made for all ages, &quot;UFO&quot; was a deliberate attempt to court young adult and adult viewers. Some &quot;UFO&quot; episodes included serious adult themes such as divorce, drug use, the challenge of maintaining work/family balance, mind control, alien abduction, illegal organ harvesting, and murder.

Establishing the main character and principal location as the chief executive of a movie studio was a cost-saving move by the producers: the Harlington-Straker Studio was the actual studio where the series was being filmed, originally the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood (later moved to Pinewood Studios)although the exterior of the Harlington-Straker studio office block seen throughout the series was actually Neptune House, an office building at ATV Elstree Studios, also in Borehamwood. Pinewood&#x27;s studio buildings and streetscapes were used extensively in later episodes, particularly &quot;Timelash&quot; and &quot;Mindbender&quot;the latter featuring scenes that show the behind-the-scenes workings of the &quot;UFO&quot; sets, when Straker briefly finds himself hallucinating that he and his colleagues are actors in a TV series. In &quot;The Man Who Came Back&quot;, the main set for &quot;The Devils&quot;, then in production at Pinewood, can be seen in the background of several scenes.

The studio-as-cover concept served multiple practical and narrative functions: It was simple and cost-effective for the production, it provided an engaging vehicle for the viewer&#x27;s suspension of disbelief, it eliminated the need to build an expensive exterior set for the SHADO base, and it combined the all-important &quot;secret&quot; cover (concealment and secrecy are always central themes in Anderson dramas) with at least nominal plausibility. A studio was a business where unusual events and routines would not be remarkable or even noticed. Comings and goings at odd times, the movement of people and unusual vehicles, equipment and material would not create undue interest and could easily be explained away as sets, props, or extras.

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced in April 1969 with production based at MGM-British Studios. Seventeen episodes were filmed at these studios before they closed at the end of 1969. Production resumed at Pinewood Studios when studio space became available in June 1970, making &quot;UFO&quot; a 17-month-long production by the time the final nine episodes were completed. After the break, George Sewell (who played Colonel Freeman) and Gabrielle Drake (Lieutenant Ellis) were no longer available, and left the series.

Harry Baird, who played interceptor pilot Mark Bradley, had left the series after just four episodes, citing contractual problems (although he reappeared in a few later episodes from stock footage). Skydiver Captain Peter Carlin, played by Peter Gordeno, left after eight episodes out of a fear of being typecast.

The different writers and directors, as well as a production break when MGM-British Studios was closed, resulted in episodes of varying quality.

===Costumes===
The Andersons never explained at the time why female Moonbase personnel uniformly wore mauve or purple wigs, silver catsuits, and extensive eye make-up, and their unusual apparel is never discussed in the series. Gerry Anderson has since commented that it made them look more futuristic and that it filmed better under the bright lights, while Sylvia Anderson said she believed wigs would become accepted components of military uniforms by the 1980s. However, in an interview given toward the end of her life, Sylvia explained that the decision was a combination of visual appeal and practicalitythe wigs provided a striking and futuristic look, but they also saved the production the considerable time and expense of having to style the hair of each of the female Moonbase staff for each episode, as well as keeping the &quot;look&quot; of the hairstyles consistent from episode to episode. However, whenever female Moonbase personnel visited Earth (as Ellis and Barry did from time to time), their lunar uniforms and wigs were never worn.

Ed Bishop, who had naturally dark hair, initially bleached his hair for Straker&#x27;s unique white-haired look. After the break in production he began wearing a white wig. Until not long before his death he possessed one of the wigs he wore on the show, and took great delight in displaying it at science fiction conventions and on TV programmes. Bishop also kept a Certina watch that was specially made for his character.

Other male characters in the series also wore wigs, again because the Andersons felt that they would become fashionable by the 1980s. Michael Billington does not wear a wig in early episodes; these can be identified by his receding hairline and long sideburns.

Only two of the alien suits were made, so at no point in the series are more than two of the aliens seen on screen at any one time. (In the episode &quot;Ordeal&quot;, Paul Foster is carried by two aliens while he is wearing an alien space suit, but one of those two aliens is always off-screen when Foster is on-screen.) The alien spacesuit costumes were made of red spandex. At the start of production, the alien spacesuits were ornamented with brass chain mesh, as seen in the episode &quot;Survival&quot;. Later, this was replaced by silvery panels. In reality, the dark vertical bands on the sides of the helmets were slits meant to allow the actors to breathe.

Sylvia Anderson, having had made a pair of very sheer trousers for actor Patrick Allen to wear in the episode &quot;Timelash&quot;, later regretted not having had the nerve to ask him to wear a jockstrap underneath, and commented on the DVD release of the series that &quot;you should not be able to tell which side anybody&#x27;s &#x27;packet&#x27; is on&quot;.

===Special effects===
The special effects, supervised by Derek Meddings, were produced with limited resources. In a refinement of the underwater effect developed for &quot;Stingray&quot;, Meddings&#x27; team devised a disconcerting effect – a double-walled visor for the alien space helmets, which could be gradually filled from the bottom up with green-dyed water. When filmed from the appropriate angle it produced an illusion of the helmet filling up and submerging the wearer&#x27;s head. The series also revisited and improved on the clever and cost-effective aquatic effects originally devised for &quot;Stingray&quot;. The submerged launch of &quot;Sky One&quot; was filmed on a special set dressed to look like an underwater location; a thin, glass-walled water tank containing small fish and equipped with small air-bubble generators was placed in front of the camera, the set behind the tank was filled with smoke, and set elements were agitated with fans to simulate water movement, creating a convincing underwater scene without any of the high cost or technical problems associated with real underwater filming.

===Vehicle design===
The vehicles were designed by Meddings and his assistant Mike Trim. As with all these Anderson series, the look and narrative action of &quot;UFO&quot; relied heavily on the miniature props and special effects sequences created by Meddings and his team, who devised a range of low-cost techniques used to create convincing miniature sets and locations and miniature action scenes featuring ground transportation, underwater, atmospheric and space travel, and dramatic explosion effects. Most production miniatures typically consisted of a mixture of custom-made elements and detail pieces cannibalised from commercial scale model kits.

The futuristic gull-winged cars driven by Straker and Foster were originally built for &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;. During the shooting of &quot;UFO&quot;, David Lowe and Sydney Carlton raised funds to form a company called The Explorer Motor Company, dedicated to the mass production of these cars for sale to the public. A plastic mould was made of the Straker car, in preparation for mass production, but the company never got off the ground. Both Ed Bishop and Michael Billington commented that the futuristic cars were &quot;impossible to drive&quot;, partly because the steering wheel was designed for looks rather than functionality.

The blue SHADO Jeepssix-wheeled light-utility vehicleswere also originally supplied for &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;. The bodies were made of marine ply, fibreglass and perspex, built on a Mini Moke chassis incorporating an extra rear axle and modified by re-positioning the windscreen rearwards. As with the other SHADO vehicles, they incorporated gull-wing doors operated by a prop man out of shot.

As with all the Anderson series of that period, very few original series props and miniatures have survived, and these are now highly valuable collector&#x27;s items. Miniatures from the series known to still exist include:

* Two of the alien flying saucer UFO miniatures
* A single large-scale miniature of Sky One
* One large-scale and one small-scale miniature of the Moonbase Interceptors (which survived because they were given to Dinky for production of its Interceptor toys)
* The (badly damaged) front section only of the smaller miniature of the Space Intruder Detector (SID)
* The large-scale model of the SID2 orbital shuttle
* One prime mover of Marker Universal Transporter truck (the lorry and trailer used to secretly transport the SHADO Mobile vehicles to their operation sites)
* One large-scale SHADO ambulance
* One large-scale Harlington-Straker Studio transport truck (The model, based on the Mk 1 Ford Transit, had previously appeared in the final Supermarionation series &quot;The Secret Service&quot;)

==Broadcast==
&quot;UFO&quot; confused broadcasters in Britain and the United States, who could not decide if it was a show for adults or for children. In the UK, the first episodes were originally shown in the 5.15 p.m. tea time slot on Saturdays, and then on Saturday mornings during an early repeat, by both Southern Televisionwhich began broadcasting &quot;UFO&quot; almost two months before the London areaand London Weekend Television. That the Andersons were primarily associated with children&#x27;s programming did not help matters.

==Reception==
Tony Jones of &quot;Starburst&quot; magazine gives the series a favourable review: &quot;To a large extent, &quot;UFO&quot; is still very watchable [...] even if effects have moved on considerably in the past several decades. The music works, the costumes are memorable, and even if some of the future looks rather dated now, the stories themselves are still strong&quot;. Paul Mounts comments that even if many episodes &quot;seem ponderous by today&#x27;s standards&quot;, the series is &quot;really all about those extraordinary visuals, the thunderingly exciting Barry Gray signature music [...] thrilling title sequence [and] overarching scenario&quot;. He argues that the final nine episodes, filmed after the move to Pinewood Studios and featuring increasingly &quot;action-orientated&quot; plots, were an improvement on the first 17.

Other reviews have been more critical. In 1972, a commentator for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; wrote that &quot;UFO&quot; &quot;plays like a combination of the worst traits of &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. According to Gary Westfahl, the series has &quot;an intriguing premise [...]; the special effects were impeccable; and even the acting was better that usual. But Anderson proved unable to imaginatively develop his story, as later episodes reveal that the aliens were People Who Look and Act Just Like Us, and the show slowed down to stupefied inertia as the aliens increasingly focused all of their energies on repetitive schemes to kill the show&#x27;s hero, Stryker .&quot;

According to a retrospective by Den of Geek, &quot;UFO&quot; &quot;caught perfectly the depressive and fatalistic Zeitgeist of 1970s cinema, with relentlessly bleak endings and a hell of a lot of suffering on the way to them. It mixed inventive scripting with frequently trite dialogue and vice versa; it put highly charged emotional, adult situations in the hands of actors who were often wearing absurd purple or platinum wigs [...] It kept you off-guard in a manner that few other shows have ever achieved, intentionally or otherwise.&quot;
Some reviews have commented on the series&#x27; mix of themes. In an article for &quot;Cinema Retro&quot;, Tim Greaves writes that &quot;UFO&quot; was the Andersons&#x27; first step &quot;towards something aimed at a more mature audience, its storylines touching upon some distinctly adult themes. Not only was there the ever-present core threat of aliens abducting humans and harvesting their organs to sustain their dying race; there were flirtations with adultery, divorce, interracial romance and the recreational use of hallucinogenic drugs [...] The very appearance of the aliens was disconcertingly sinister, sporting eerie liquid-filled helmets [...] Additionally, the characters regularly made flawed decisions and not all the stories concluded happily. There was also a pervasive frisson of sexuality throughout the series [...] Peter Hutchings of Northumbria University argues that in trying to be more &quot;adult-centred&quot; than earlier Anderson productions, the series &quot;[contained, limited or diminished] its generic science fiction elements&quot;. He notes that only six of the first 17 episodes focus squarely on the alien threat; in other episodes, the aliens are incidental to storylines that have little grounding in science fiction, such as the organisational politics of SHADO and &quot;tensions between emotional expression and operational efficiency&quot;.

==Aborted second series==
Two years after the 26 episodes were completed, the series was syndicated on American television. Many stations which carried the series were affiliated with CBS; they tended to schedule the show in the Saturday evening hour leading into &quot;All in the Family&quot;, the hugely popular comedy which was the highest-rated program on all of U.S. television at the time. The ratings of &quot;UFO&quot; were initially promising enough to prompt ITC to commission a second series.

As the Moon-based episodes appeared to have proven more popular than the Earth-based stories, ITC insisted that in the new series, the action would take place entirely on the Moon. Gerry Anderson proposed a format in which SHADO Moonbase had been greatly enlarged to become the organisation&#x27;s main headquarters, and pre-production on &quot;UFO 2&quot; began with extensive research and design for the new Moonbase. These developments had precedent in the earlier episodes: a subplot of &quot;Kill Straker!&quot; sees Straker negotiating with SHADO&#x27;s financial supporters for funding to build more moonbases within 10 years. However, when ratings for the syndicated broadcasts in America dropped towards the end of the run, ITC cancelled the second series plans. Unwilling to let the &quot;UFO 2&quot; pre-production work go to waste, Anderson instead offered ITC a new series idea, unrelated to &quot;UFO&quot;, in which the Moon would be blown out of Earth orbit taking the Moonbase survivors with it. This proposal developed into &quot;&quot;.

==Merchandise==
As with many Anderson productions, the series generated a range of merchandising toys based on the SHADO vehicles. The classic Dinky die-cast range of vehicles featured robust yet finely finished products, and included Straker&#x27;s futuristic gull-winged gas turbine car, the SHADO mobile and the missile-bearing Lunar Interceptor, though Dinky&#x27;s version of the interceptor was released in a lurid metallic green finish unlike the original&#x27;s stark white. Like the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot; models, the original Dinky toys are now prized collectors&#x27; items. All the major vehicles, characters, and more have been produced in model form many times over by a large number of licensee companies; the Anderson shows and their merchandise have always had widespread popularity, but they are especially popular in Japan.

==Compilation films==
In the 1970s and 1980s a number of the episodes were cut and compiled to create compilation films. Among these was &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot;, a 1980 compilation of scenes from &quot;Identified&quot;, &quot;Computer Affair&quot;, &quot;Reflections in the Water&quot;, &quot;Confetti Check A-O.K.&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Came Back&quot; and &quot;E.S.P.&quot;, featuring new title music. A subtitled &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot; was released in Japan as the first of eight VHS and Betamax tape &quot;UFO&quot; volumes by Emotion Video in 1984, and on Laserdisc format.

Italian producers KENT and INDIEF made compilation films which met mixed reviews. The films used music tracks from the James Bond films &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; and &quot;Thunderball&quot;, for &quot;UFO&quot;″s composer, Barry Gray, had his name confused with &quot;Bond&quot; composer John Barry.. The Italian films are:

* UFOAllarme rosso... attacco alla Terra! (, KENT, 1973) from episodes &quot;The Cat with Ten Lives&quot;, &quot;The Psychobombs&quot; and &quot;Timelash&quot;
* UFODistruggete Base Luna (, KENT, 1973): &quot;The Cat with Ten Lives&quot;, &quot;Confetti Check A-O.K.&quot;, &quot;Flight Path&quot;, &quot;The Psychobombs&quot;, &quot;A Question of Priorities&quot; and &quot;Kill Straker!&quot;
* UFOPrendeteli vivi (, INDIEF, 1974): &quot;Computer Affair&quot;, &quot;Ordeal&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, &quot;Destruction&quot; and &quot;Reflections in the Water&quot;
* UFOContatto Radar... stanno atterrando...! (, INDIEF, 1974): &quot;Exposed&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot;, &quot;Court Martial&quot; and &quot;Sub-Smash&quot;
* UFOAnnientate SHADO... Uccidete Straker... Stop! (, KENT, 1974): &quot;Identified&quot;, &quot;Computer Affair&quot; and &quot;Reflections in the Water&quot;

==Home media==
In 1986–1987, Channel 5 released a seven-volume VHS collection of episodes (volumes 2–7), preceded by the compilation film &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot; (volume 1), while a similar series was later released by ITC in 1993.

The complete series was released on DVD in the UK and in North America in 2002 and in Australia in 2007. Bonus features include a commentary by Gerry Anderson on the pilot episode &quot;Identified&quot;, and an actor&#x27;s commentary by Ed Bishop on the episode &quot;Sub-Smash&quot;. There are also deleted scenes, stills and publicity artwork.

In 2002, A&amp;E Home Entertainment, under licence from Carlton International Media Limited released the complete series on Region 1 (US/North America) DVD.

==Proposed feature film==
In 2009, it was announced that producer Robert Evans and ITV Global would produce a feature film adaptation of the series. Ryan Gaudet and Joseph Kanarek were to write the script, which was to be set in 2020. It was claimed that the &quot;UFO&quot; movie would be visual effects supervisor Matthew Gratzner&#x27;s directorial debut and that Joshua Jackson would play Colonel Paul Foster. Ali Larter was linked to the role of Colonel Virginia Lake. The film did not enter production.

==In other media==

Stories set in the Gerry Anderson &quot;UFO&quot; series have appeared in various media:

* Two novelisations based on the series, written by John Burke under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Miall&quot;, were published in the UK and America:
**&quot;UFO&quot; (published in the US as &quot;UFO-1: Flesh Hunters&quot;). Novelises portions of the TV episodes &quot;Identified&quot;, &quot;Exposed&quot;, &quot;Close Up&quot; and &quot;Court Martial&quot;.
**&quot;UFO 2&quot; (published in the US as &quot;UFO-2: Sporting Blood&quot;). Novelises the TV episodes &quot;Computer Affair&quot;, &quot;The Dalotek Affair&quot; and &quot;Survival&quot;.
* &quot;UFO&quot; comic strips were published in the comics &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;TV Action&quot;.
* Between 1991 and 1999, Entropy Express (based in Brighton, South Australia) published seven issues of a periodical called &quot;Flightpath&quot;, containing 39 text stories set in the &quot;UFO&quot; universe. These include a crossover with &quot;Bergerac&quot; and another with &quot;Predator&quot;.
* &quot;UFO&quot; episodes were adapted as photocomics in the Italian publication &quot;I film di UFO&quot; (&quot;The &quot;UFO&quot; films&quot;).
* An Italian-language board game of the race game type was published, called &quot;Distruggete Base Luna&quot; (&quot;Destroy Moonbase&quot;; in reference to the compilation movie), with up to four players, each representing an alien trying to penetrate Moonbase, and one player representing Straker in charge of Moonbase.
* Julian Gollop of British independent video game developer Mythos Games has cited &quot;UFO&quot; as one of the influences for the storyline of the video game &quot;&quot; even though he thought the series itself was &quot;a bit boring&quot;. In particular, an idea of an international counter-UFO organization and the psionic powers of some alien races. 
* Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto drew inspiration from &quot;UFO&quot; for the character designs for Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; (from Straker and Freeman respectively).

<doc id="472614" wikidata="Q5279667" url="?curid=472614" title="Dip (dance move)">
<text>Dips are common to many partner dance styles (Tango, Lindy Hop, Salsa, Ballroom dances), as well as couple&#x27;s Disco. 

Characteristics of a dip include:
* weight-sharing. Usually the follower supports part (or all) of her weight by the supporting leg bent at the knee. The lead frequently uses one foot to point and thus is supporting his weight, and part of the follower&#x27;s weight, on one bent knee;
* the free leg of the follower is usually straight;
* dancers&#x27; centres go lower than when standing;
* &quot;holding&quot; (pausing) to accentuate the &quot;floor-stopping&quot; move;

Some dance styles distinguish between sits, dips, and drops; as a general rule, the difference is the degree to which the base (usually the leader) ends up responsible for the mass and balance of the flyer (usually the follower). Where a distinction is made, it&#x27;s usually a continuum from least to most responsibility, with sits being the least, drops the most, and dips in between.

Difficulty of the dip moves varies, with some dips being easy, and some requiring &quot;considerable strength and flexibility&quot;.

<text>A deputy leader (in Scottish English, sometimes depute leader) in the Westminster system is the second-in-command of a political party, behind the party leader. Deputy leaders often become Deputy prime minister when their parties are elected to government. The deputy leader may take on the role of the leader if the current leader is, for some reason, unable to perform their role as leader. For example, the deputy leader often takes the place of the party leader at question time sessions in their absence. They also often have other responsibilities of party management.

<doc id="472622" wikidata="Q5879855" url="?curid=472622" title="Holdout problem">
<text>In finance, a holdout problem occurs when a bond issuer is in default or nears default, and launches an exchange offer in an attempt to restructure debt held by existing bond holders. Such exchange offers typically require the consent of holders of some minimum portion of the total outstanding debt, often in excess of 90%, because, unless the terms of the bond provide otherwise, non-consenting bondholders will retain their legal right to demand repayment of their bonds at par (the full face amount). Bondholders who withhold their consent and retain their right to seek the full repayment of original bonds, may disrupt the restructuring process, creating a situation known as the holdout problem.

The contractual terms for obligating all bondholders to accept a restructuring approved by some supermajority is typically spelled out in what are known as Collective Action Clauses, or CACs. In some jurisdictions, CACs or their equivalents are required under local law, but this is not a universal practice. CACs can represent additional borrowing costs for lenders while conversely, borrowers may seek lower debt costs without CAC protection but this exposes them to holdout conditions and potential damaging and expensive litigation which in the case of post-2001 Argentina essentially locked that country out of access to conventional international financing.

The &quot;holdouts&quot; gamble that the restructuring will take place despite the lack of their consent, potentially leading to full repayment of their bonds, while other bondholders receive reduced payments according to the terms of the restructuring. If the restructuring does not take place, they gain nothing, but holdouts may initiate damaging litigation that results in extremely high costs in direct and indirect economic injury to the debtor.

The claims of the holdouts may be insignificant enough, and bothersome enough, that the issuer may satisfy them in whole simply not to be bothered.

Where bondholders are widely dispersed, as is often the case, it can be difficult to contact many holders. Further, many holders of small amounts of bonds have little incentive to invest the time and energy in evaluating the terms of the exchange offer. These factors represent substantial difficulties in obtaining the minimum consent levels.

==Holdout problem in sovereign debt restructuring==

If countries face the danger of default, additional complications might occur and increase the Holdout problem:

===National pride===

Governments fear damages of their status as an advanced economy, which could lead to increasing sovereign bond yields. As an example, during the Eurozone crisis the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy said: “we will show that Europeans pay their debt”. Sarkozy was aiming at declining bond yields with his statement, but showed implicitly that countries want to avoid sovereign debt restructurings for reasons of their own national pride.

Sovereign debt restructuring could be tantamount to an admission of emerging market status.

===Contagion===

In currency unions (such as the Eurozone) the effect of complex economic relationships could possibly lead to a conflagration. A debt restructuring of numerous countries or one great country might destabilize the global banking industry.

===Relationship between sovereign debt and private sector===

In the majority of countries, a substantial part of sovereign bonds is likely to be held by financial institutions in the sovereign&#x27;s own country (like banks, insurance companies and pension funds). Restructuring those instruments will therefore undermine the health of the domestic financial system. Even if countries are able to reduce significantly their costs of debt service, the same amount might need to be spent in bank recapitalizations.

===Feasibility===

Creditors left behind in a restructuring could lead to following problems:

* If there are enough of them, the financial predicates underlying the entire restructuring may be undone.
* If holdouts are subsequently paid in full, it makes the participating creditors look deprived and this leads in the next restructuring to even more holdouts. 
* If holdouts are not paid after the restructuring closes, they pose an ongoing litigation and attachment threat to the debtor, e.g. Argentina’s decade-long legal fight with thousands of holders of the Argentine bonds that went into default in 2001.

==European Stability Mechanism==

The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has been installed in order to help out countries of the Eurozone in financial distress. In case of an ESM-approved sovereign debt restructuring, the Holdout problem might play a significant role. Following amendments to the ESM could reduce this problem:

* Ensuring that the financial support being provided by the ESM to one of its members is not diverted to the repayment of an existing debt obligation of that member that was eligible to participate in a debt restructuring but declined to do so
* Assisting the beneficiary member state in any ESM-approved restructuring of its debt by deflating the expectations of prospective holdouts that they will be able to extract a preferential recovery through the pursuit of legal remedies after the restructuring closes
* Providing a safe harbor in the Eurozone for the recipient state to hold its assets and conduct its financial affairs without fear of harassment by holdout creditors

==Recent examples==

===Peru===

Successful litigations were undertaken by some holdouts in Peru (1996).

===Argentina===

A similar dispute between Argentina and holdouts has been ongoing since at least the 2005 Argentine debt restructuring. Bondholders that accepted the 2005 swap (two out of three did so, while accepting only about one-third of the bond value in the restructuring) saw the severely reduced value of their bonds rise 90% by 2012, and these continued to rise strongly during 2013.

An August 2013 appeals court ruling in &quot;Argentina v. NML Capital&quot;, 12-1494, determined that holdouts should be repaid the full face value, but without the losses taken by those who had accepted the 2005 and 2010 swaps at a 70%-75% discount. In October 2013 the Supreme Court affirmed the decision without comment. A second decision of the 2nd Circuit which prohibits payments to creditors who did accept the swap if holdouts are not paid was on appeal to the full panel as of October 2013. This case may also be appealed to the Supreme Court. Enforcement of the decisions is stayed pending a final Supreme Court decision. Courts in Belgium, France, and Germany have backed Argentina on the basis of the equal terms clause, however. The lack of legal certainty is U.S. courts prompted Argentine officials to propose placing the restructured bonds in question under Argentine law, while concurrently announcing a renewed bond swap offer. However, court decisions outside the US had no bearing on Argentina&#x27;s debt obligations, since Argentina had sold their debt under US law.

The possibility that holdout creditors can attach future payments on restructured debt and receive better treatment than cooperating creditors distorts incentives and can derail efforts for a cooperative restructuring. It is likely to be of particular importance in cases in which the creditors are being asked to accept substantial debt and debt service reduction. However, it is unclear given the special circumstances of the Elliot case whether it will be broadly applicable to holdouts in other restructurings. The new Argentine government elected in late 2015 gave indications of its willingness to negotiate with the set of thousands of holdout creditors. The Argentine situation has increased awareness of the utility of Collective Action Clauses in preventing or reducing holdout complications in debt restructuring.

<doc id="472628" wikidata="Q379356" url="?curid=472628" title="Mormon Trail">
<text>The Mormon Trail is the route from Illinois to Utah on which Mormon pioneers (members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) traveled from 1846 to 1869. Today, the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States National Trails System, known as the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail.

The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo, Illinois, which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints from 1839 to 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah, which was settled by Brigham Young and his followers beginning in 1847. From Council Bluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail.

The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846 after Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo. They left with the aim of establishing a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa. Along their way, some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants. During the winter of 1846–47, the emigrants wintered in Iowa, other nearby states, and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska, with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters, Nebraska. In the spring of 1847, Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley, which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah.

During the first few years, the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah. Later, the emigrants increasingly included converts from the British Isles and Europe. The trail was used for more than 20 years, until the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. Among the emigrants were the Mormon handcart pioneers of 1856–60. Two of the handcart companies, led by James G. Willie and Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.

==Background==

Under the leadership of Joseph Smith, Latter Day Saints established several communities throughout the United States between 1830 and 1844, most notably in Kirtland, Ohio; Independence, Missouri; and Nauvoo, Illinois. However, the Saints were driven out of each of these settlements in turn, due to conflicts with other settlers. This included the actions of Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs, who issued Missouri Executive Order 44, which called for the &quot;extermination&quot; of all Mormons in Missouri. Latter-day Saints were finally forced to abandon Nauvoo in 1846.

Although the movement had split into several denominations after Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, most members aligned themselves with Brigham Young. Under Young&#x27;s leadership, about 14,000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo set out to find a new home in the West.

==The Trek West==
Following the succession crisis, Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else wanted and felt the isolated Great Basin would provide the Saints with many advantages.

Young reviewed information on the Great Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulted with mountain men and trappers, and met with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the region. Young also organized a vanguard company to break trail to the Rocky Mountains, evaluate trail conditions, find sources of water, and select a central gathering point in the Great Basin. A new route on the north side of the Platte and North Platte rivers was chosen to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access, and campsites with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the river&#x27;s south side.

The Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions demanding that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they failed to meet the May deadline. To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.

=== Trek of 1846 ===
The departure from Nauvoo began on February 4, 1846, under the leadership of Brigham Young. This early departure exposed them to the elements in the worst of winter. After crossing the Mississippi River, the journey across Iowa Territory followed primitive territorial roads and Native American trails.

Young originally planned to lead an express company of about 300 men to the Great Basin during the summer of 1846. He believed they could cross Iowa and reach the Missouri River in approximately four to six weeks. However, the actual trip across Iowa was slowed by rain, mud, swollen rivers, and poor preparation, and it required 16 weeks – nearly three times longer than planned.

Heavy rains turned the rolling plains of southern Iowa into a quagmire of axle-deep mud. Furthermore, few people carried adequate provisions for the trip. The weather, general unpreparedness, lack of experience in moving such a large group of people, and the much longer duration of the trip than anticipated earlier all contributed to the difficulties they endured.

The initial party reached the Missouri River on June 14. It was apparent that the Latter-day Saints could not make it to the Great Basin that season and would have to winter on the Missouri River.

Some of the emigrants established a settlement called Kanesville (present-day Council Bluffs) on the Iowa side of the river. Others moved across the river into the area of present-day Omaha, Nebraska, and built a camp called Winter Quarters.

=== The Vanguard Company of 1847 ===
In April 1847, chosen members of the vanguard company gathered, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three African-Americans and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year. On April 5, the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.

The journey from Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie took six weeks; the company arrived at the fort on June 1. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the Mormon Battalion, who had been excused due to illness and sent to winter in Pueblo, Colorado, and a group of Church members from Mississippi. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at Fort Bridger.

Young met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed routes into the Salt Lake Valley and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River, and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by 12 more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.

Now facing a more rugged and hazardous trek, Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several other members of the party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a &quot;mountain fever&quot; induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route.

===Arrival and settlement===
Scouts Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21. The main party entered the valley on July 22, camping that night near the modern-day First Encampment Park. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted. On July 24, Young first saw the valley from a &quot;sick&quot; wagon driven by his friend Wilford Woodruff. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared, &quot;This is the right place, drive on.&quot;

In August 1847, Young and selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters to organize the companies scheduled for following years. By December 1847, more than 2,000 Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley, then in Mexican territory.

Farming the uncultivated land was initially difficult, as the shares broke when they tried to plow the dry ground. Therefore, an irrigation system was designed and the land was flooded before plowing, and the resulting system provided supplemental moisture during the year.

Salt Lake City was laid out and designated as Church headquarters. Hard work produced a prosperous community. In their new settlement, entertainment was also important, and the first public building was a theater.

It did not take long, however, until the United States caught up with them, and in 1848, after the end of the war with Mexico, the land in which they settled became part of the United States.

===Ongoing migration===

Each year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into &quot;companies&quot;, each company bearing the name of its leader and subdivided into groups of 10 and 50. The Saints traveled the trail broken by the vanguard company, splitting the journey into two sections. The first segment began in Nauvoo and ended in Winter Quarters, near modern-day Omaha, Nebraska. The second half of the journey took the Saints through the area that later became Nebraska and Wyoming, before finishing their journey in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. The earlier groups used covered wagons pulled by oxen to carry their supplies across the country. Some later companies used handcarts and traveled by foot. William Clayton, a member of the vanguard company, published the popular &quot;The Latter-Day Saints&#x27; Emigrants&#x27; Guide&quot; to help guide travelers on the way.

By 1849, many of the Latter-day Saints who remained in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs of the wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.

=== Handcarts: 1856–60 ===

In 1856, the church inaugurated a system of handcart companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While not the first to use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.

The handcarts were modeled after carts used by street sweepers and were made almost entirely of wood. They were generally six to seven feet (183 to 213 cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet (91 to 122 cm) long and eight inches (20 cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227 kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions.

All but two of the handcart companies successfully completed the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms for the remainder of the journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.

The handcart companies continued with more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued for those who could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.

==Sites along the trail==
The following are major points along the trail at which the early Mormon pioneers stopped, established temporary camps, or used as landmarks and meeting places. The sites are categorized by their location in respect to modern-day US states.

===Illinois===
* Nauvoo – Nauvoo was the starting point for the Mormon trail. Since 1839, it had been the headquarters for the church. During the 1840s, Nauvoo rivaled Chicago in size. Tensions rose between the Latter-day Saints and other locals culminating with the expulsion of the Saints. Brigham Young led his followers to Utah, not part of the United States at the time.

===Iowa===
*Sugar Creek ( west of Nauvoo) – Beginning with their first ferry crossing of the Mississippi River on February 4, 1846, months before many of them were ready, the Latter-day Saints started gathering at the frozen banks of Sugar Creek. More refugees continued to cross into Iowa for a number of months many taking advantage of the freezing Mississippi River a few weeks later. The poorly prepared emigrants suffered from severe winter weather while camped there. Sugar Creek was the staging area for the westward trek across Iowa. Ultimately about 2,500 refugees and 500 wagons started west on March 1, 1846. Several thousand more would follow on later as they sold their property for what they could get and continued to leave Nauvoo, Illinois.
*Richardson&#x27;s Point ( west) – The emigrants made their way past Croton and Farmington to ford the Des Moines River at Bonaparte. In early March 1846 the party was halted for 10 days by heavy rain at a wooded area known as Richardson&#x27;s Point. Some of the first deaths of the pioneers occurred at this location.
*Chariton River Crossing ( west) – The trail continues past the modern towns of Troy, Drakesville, and West Grove to reach the Chariton River. At this crossing, on March 27, Young organized the lead group of the migration, forming three camps of 100 families, each led by a captain. This military-style organization would be used for all subsequent Mormon emigrant companies.
*Locust Creek ( west) – The trail proceeds past Cincinnati to Locust Creek. There on April 13 William Clayton, scribe for Brigham Young, composed &quot;Come, Come Ye Saints,&quot; the most famous and enduring hymn from the Mormon Trail.
*Garden Grove ( west) – On April 23 the emigrants arrived at the location of their first semi-permanent settlement, which they named Garden Grove. They enclosed and planted to supply food for later emigrants and established a village that is still in existence today. About 600 Latter-day Saints settled at Garden Grove. By 1852 they had moved on to Utah.
*Mount Pisgah ( west) – As they entered Potawatomi territory, the emigrants established another semi-permanent settlement that they named Mount Pisgah. Several thousand acres were cultivated and a settlement of about 700 Latter-day Saints thrived there from 1846 to 1852. Now the site is marked by a park, which contains exhibits, historical markers, and a reconstructed log cabin. However, little remains from the 19th century except a cemetery memorializing the 300 to 800 emigrants who died there.
*Nishnabotna River Crossing ( west) – From Mount Pisgah the trail proceeds past the modern towns of Orient, Bridgewater, Massena and Lewis. Just west of Lewis, the 1846 emigrants passed a Potawatomi encampment on the Nishnabotna River. The Potawatomis were also refugees; 1846 was their last year in the area.
*Grand Encampment ( west) – From the Nishnabotna River, the trail proceeds past present-day Macedonia to Mosquito Creek on the eastern outskirts of present-day Council Bluffs. The first emigrant company arrived on June 13, 1846. At this open area, where the Iowa School for the Deaf is now located, the LDS emigrant companies paused and camped, forming what was called the &quot;Grand Encampment.&quot; From this site on July 20, the Mormon Battalion departed for the Mexican–American War.
*Kanesville (later Council Bluffs) ( west) – The emigrants established an important settlement and outfitting point at this site on the Missouri River, originally known as Miller&#x27;s Hollow. The emigrants renamed the settlement as &quot;Kanesville,&quot; honoring Thomas L. Kane, a non-LDS attorney who was politically well connected and used his influence to assist the Latter-day Saints. From 1846 to 1852, it was an important LDS settlement and the outfitting point for companies traveling to present-day Utah. Orson Hyde, an Apostle and ecclesiastical leader of the settlement, published a newspaper called the &quot;Frontier Guardian.&quot; In 1852 the major LDS settlements at Kanesville, Mount Pisgah, and Garden Grove were closed as the settlers moved on to Utah. After 1852, however, the Church continued to outfit and supply emigrant companies (mostly LDS converts coming from the British Isles and mainland Europe) at this community, now renamed &quot;Council Bluffs,&quot; until the mid-1860s, when the terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad was extended to the west.

===Nebraska===

*Winter Quarters ( west) – Although Brigham Young had originally planned to travel all the way to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846, the emigrants&#x27; lack of preparation had become apparent during their difficult crossing of Iowa. Furthermore, the departure of the Mormon Battalion left the emigrants short on manpower. Young decided to settle for the winter along the Missouri River. The emigrants were located on both sides of the river, but their settlement at Winter Quarters on the west side was the largest. There they built 700 dwellings where an estimated 3,500 Latter-day Saints spent the winter of 1846–47; many would also reside there during the winter of 1847–48. Conditions such as scurvy, consumption, chills and fever were common; the settlement recorded 359 deaths between September 1846 and May 1848. However, while at Winter Quarters the LDS emigrants were able to save or trade for the equipment and supplies that they would need to continue the westward trek. The settlement was later renamed Florence and is now located in Omaha.
*Elkhorn River ( west)
*Platte River ( west) – All emigrants leaving Missouri traveled along the Great Platte River Road for hundreds of miles. There was a prevailing opinion that the North side of the river was healthier, so most Latter-day Saints generally stuck to that side, which also separated them from unpleasant encounters with potential former enemies, like emigrants from Missouri or Illinois. In 1849, 1850 and 1852, traffic was so heavy along the Platte that virtually all feed was stripped from both sides of the river. The lack of food and the threat of disease made the journey along the Platte a deadly gamble.
*Loup Fork ( west) – Crossing the Loup Fork was, like the Elkhorn, one of the early and very difficult crossings during the trek west from Council Bluffs.
*Fort Kearny ( west) – This fort, named after Stephen Watts Kearny, was established in June 1848. Another fort named after Kearny was established in May 1846, but was abandoned in May 1848. Due to this, the second Fort Kearny is sometimes called New Fort Kearny. The site for the fort was purchased from the Pawnee Indians for $2,000 in goods.
*Confluence Point ( west) – On May 11, 1847, north of the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers, a &quot;roadometer&quot; was attached to Heber C. Kimball&#x27;s wagon driven by Philo Johnson. Although they did not invent the device, the measurements of the version they used were accurate enough to be used by William Clayton in his famous &quot;Latter-day Saints&#x27; Emigrants&#x27; Guide&quot;.
*Ash Hollow ( west) – Many passing diarists noted the beauty of Ash Hollow, although this was ruined by thousands of passing emigrants. The Sioux Indians were often on location and were at the site and General William S. Harney&#x27;s troops won a battle over the Sioux there in September 1855 – the Battle of Ash Hollow. The site is also the burial ground of many who died of cholera during the gold rush years.
*Chimney Rock ( west) – Chimney Rock is perhaps the most significant landmark on the Mormon Trail. Emigrants commented in their diaries that the landmark appeared closer than it actually was, and many sketched or painted it in their journals and carved their names into it.
*Scotts Bluff ( west) – Hiram Scott was a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper abandoned on the bluff that now bears his name by his companions when he became ill. Accounts of his death are noted by almost all those who kept journals that traveled on the north side of the Platte. The grave of Rebecca Winters, a Latter-day Saint mother who fell victim to cholera in 1852, is also located near this site, although it has since been moved and rededicated.

===Wyoming===

*Fort Laramie ( west) – This old trading and military post served as a place for the emigrants to rest and restock provisions. The 1856 Willie Handcart Company was unable to obtain provisions at Fort Laramie, contributing to their subsequent tragedy when they ran out of food while encountering blizzard conditions along the Sweetwater River.
*Upper Platte/Mormon Ferry ( west) – The last crossing of the Platte River took place near modern Casper. For several years the Latter-day Saints operated a commercial ferry at the site, earning revenue from the Oregon- and California-bound emigrants. The ferry was discontinued in 1853 after a competing toll bridge was constructed. On October 19, 1856, the Martin Handcart Company forded the freezing river in mid-October, leading to exposure that would prove fatal to many members of the company.
*Red Butte ( west) – Red Butte was the most tragic site of the Mormon Trail. After crossing the Platte River, the Martin Handcart Company camped near Red Butte as heavy snow fell. Snow continued to fall for three days, and the company came to a halt as many emigrants died. For nine days the company remained there, while 56 persons died from cold or disease. Finally, on October 28, an advance team of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them. The rescuers encouraged them that help was on the way and urged the company to start moving on.
*Sweetwater River ( west) – From the last crossing of the Platte, the trail heads directly southwest toward Independence Rock, where it meets and follows the Sweetwater River to South Pass. To shorten the journey by avoiding the twists and turns of the river, the trail includes nine river crossings.
*Independence Rock ( west) – Independence Rock was one of the trail&#x27;s best known and most anticipated landmarks. Many emigrants carved their names on the rock; many of these carvings are still visible today. The emigrants sometimes also celebrated their arrival at this landmark with a dance.

*Devil&#x27;s Gate ( west) – Devil&#x27;s Gate was a narrow gorge cut through the rocks by the Sweetwater River. A small fort was located at Devil&#x27;s Gate, which was unoccupied in 1856 when the Martin Handcart Company was rescued. The rescuers unloaded unnecessary equipment from the wagons so the weaker handcart emigrants could ride. A group of 19 men, led by Daniel W. Jones, stayed at the fort over the winter to protect the property.
*Martin&#x27;s Cove ( west) – On November 4, 1856, the Martin Handcart Company set up camp in Martin&#x27;s Cove as another blizzard halted their progress. They remained there for five days until the weather abated and they could proceed toward Salt Lake City. Today, a visitor center is located on the site.
*Rocky Ridge ( west) – Between the fifth and sixth crossings of the Sweetwater, on October 19, 1856, the Willie Handcart Company was halted by the same snowstorm that stopped the Martin Handcart Company near Red Butte. At the same time, the members of the Willie Company reached the end of their supplies of flour. A small advance team from the rescue party found their camp and gave them a small amount of flour, but then pushed on to the east to try to locate the Martin Company. Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead through the snow to find the main rescue party and inform them of the Willie Company&#x27;s peril. On October 23, with the help of the rescue party, the Willie Company pushed ahead through the biting wind and snow up Rocky Ridge, a rough section of the trail that ascends to a ridge in order to bypass a section of the Sweetwater River valley that is impassable.
*Rock Creek ( west) – After their grueling 18-hour trek up Rocky Ridge, the Willie Handcart Company camped at the crossing of Rock Creek. That night 13 emigrants died; the next morning their bodies were buried in a shallow grave.

*South Pass (Continental Divide) ( west) – South Pass, a wide pass across the Continental Divide, is located between the modern towns of Atlantic City and Farson. At an elevation of above sea level, it was one of the most important landmarks of the Mormon Trail. Near South Pass is Pacific Springs, which received its name because its waters ran to the Pacific Ocean.
*Green River/Lombard Ferry ( west) – The trail crosses the Green River between the modern towns of Farson and Granger. The Latter-day Saints operated a ferry at this location to assist the church&#x27;s emigrants and to earn money from other emigrants traveling to Oregon and California.
*Ft. Bridger ( west) – Fort Bridger was established in 1842 by famous mountain man Jim Bridger. This was the site where the paths of the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail separated; the three trails ran in parallel from Missouri River to Fort Bridger. In 1855, the LDS Church bought the fort from Jim Bridger and Louis Vazquez for $8,000. During the Utah War in 1857, the Utah militia burned down the fort so that it would not fall into the hands of the advancing U.S. Army under General A.S. Johnston.
*Bear River Crossing ( west) – At this, one of the last river crossings on the Mormon Trail, Lansford Hastings and his company turned north, while the Reed–Donner Company turned south. Also at this site, the vanguard company met mountaineer Miles Goodyear on July 10, 1847, who attempted to persuade them to take the northern track toward his trading post.
*The Needles ( west) – Near this very prominent rock formation, close to the Utah–Wyoming border, Brigham Young became ill with what was probably Rocky Mountain spotted fever during the advance push into the Salt Lake Valley.

*Echo Canyon ( west) – One of the last canyons through which the emigrants descended, this deep and narrow canyon made it a veritable, and frequently noted, echo chamber.
*Big Mountain ( west) – Although dwarfed by the surrounding Wasatch mountain peaks, this was the highest elevation of the entire Mormon trail at 8,400 feet (2560 m).
*Golden Pass Road ( west) – Although unsuccessful in a petition to Salt Lake City for funding, Parley P. Pratt obtained the deed to the canyon and began the construction of a road through Big Canyon Creek in the Wasatch Mountains just south of Emigration Canyon in July 1849. The canyon became known as Parley&#x27;s Canyon and the road he built as the &quot;Golden Pass Road,&quot; due to the large number of gold miners who used it on their way to California. A cutoff was constructed through Silver Creek Canyon by 1862, diverting much of the traffic on what is today the route of I-80.
*Emigration Canyon (Donner Hill) ( west) – About a year before the Latter-day Saint emigrants, the Reed–Donner wagon train carved the first road through the final geographic obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley. About halfway through, the group changed course and went up and around the final constriction near the valley&#x27;s mouth. The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and to the west. When an advance team from the Latter-day Saint vanguard company came through, it chose to stick to the valley floor and hacked its way through to the bench overlooking the Great Salt Lake basin in less than four hours.
*Salt Lake Valley ( west) – Although the Salt Lake Valley had a special meaning to each emigrant, signifying the end of more than a year of crossing the plains, not all of the pioneering Saints settled in the Salt Lake Valley. Settlement outside the Salt Lake Valley began as early as 1848, with a number of communities planted in the Weber valley to the north. Additional townsites were carefully chosen, with settlements placed near canyon mouths with access to dependable streams and stands of timber. Latter-day Saints founded more than 600 communities from Canada down into Mexico. As historian Wallace Stegner stated, the Latter-day Saints &quot;were one of the principal forces in the settlement of the West.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Salmon&quot; (SS-182) was the lead ship of her class of submarine. She was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the salmon.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Salmon&quot;′s keel was laid down on 15 April 1936 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 12 June 1937, sponsored by Miss Hester Laning, daughter of Rear Admiral Harris Laning, Commandant of the 3rd Naval District and New York Navy Yard. &quot;Salmon&quot; was commissioned on 15 March 1938.

== 1939–1941 ==

After shakedown training and trials along the Atlantic coast from the West Indies to Nova Scotia, &quot;Salmon&quot; joined Submarine Division 15, Squadron 6 of the Submarine Force, U.S. Fleet, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. As flagship of her division, she operated along the Atlantic coast until she relinquished the flag to sister ship late in 1939 as the division was shifted to the West Coast at San Diego.

&quot;Salmon&quot; operated along the West Coast through 1940 and the greater portion of 1941. Late that year, she was transferred with her division and the submarine tender , to the Asiatic station. On 18 November, &quot;Holland&quot; with &quot;Salmon&quot;, , , and arrived at Manila and formed SubDiv 21 of the Asiatic fleet to bolster defenses in the Philippines as marked tension was growing due to Japanese militarism.

== World War II ==

&quot;Salmon&quot; was conducting a patrol from Manila, Philippines, along the west coast of Luzon at the time of the surprise air raid by the Japanese against the Philippine bases and Pearl Harbor. Having been on defensive deployment since 27 November, in a wait-and-watch posture, she commenced war patrolling immediately upon receiving word of the attacks. On 22 December, while on the surface in Lingayen Gulf, she encountered two Japanese destroyers and pressed home an attack which seemed to bewilder the reluctant enemy. She succeeded in damaging both targets by delivering a &quot;down the throat&quot; spread of torpedoes which caught them as they veered course in opposite directions. She then was able to avoid further contact by ducking into a rain squall.

=== 1942 ===

In January 1942, she moved south to operate in the Gulf of Davao and off the southern tip of Mindanao and thence proceeded to Manipa Strait between Bura and Ceram in the Molucca Islands. In February, she patrolled the Flores Sea from north of Timor to Lombok Strait in the Sunda Islands, then put into Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java on 13 February.

The capture of the airfield on Bali on 18 February 1942 and the losses suffered by American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) forces in the battle of Badung Strait on 20 February forced the abandonment of the ABDA base at Surabaya and exposed Tjilatjap to a possible trap. The tender &quot;Holland&quot; moved her base of operations to Exmouth Gulf, Australia, on 20 February, as &quot;Salmon&quot; set out on her second war patrol.

&quot;Salmon&quot; spent the next month in the Java Sea on patrol between Sepandjang and the area just west of Bawean. She arrived at Fremantle, Australia, on 23 March to end her second patrol.

Beginning her third war patrol, &quot;Salmon&quot; departed from Fremantle on 3 May and established a barrier patrol along the south coast of Java to intercept Japanese shipping. On 3 May, she torpedoed and sank the 11,441-ton repair ship &quot;Asahi.&quot; On May 28th, the 4,382-ton passenger-cargo vessel &quot;Ganges Maru&quot; was torpedoed by her as well. On 24 June, &quot;Salmon&quot; returned to Fremantle and commenced preparations for her next patrol.

&quot;Salmon&quot; departed Fremantle on 21 July for her fourth war patrol in the South China Sea-Sulu Sea area. Sailing via Lombok and Makassar Straits, the Sibutu Passage, and the Balabac Strait, she stationed herself between North Borneo and Palawan, Philippine Islands. During this patrol, &quot;Salmon&quot; was unable to gain a favorable position for successful attack, but made numerous sightings and reports of shipping movements to sister subs in the vicinity. She returned to Fremantle on 8 September.

&quot;Salmon&quot;″s fifth war patrol began on 10 October, and her area of operations was off Corregidor and Subic Bay. On the night of 10 November, she challenged a large sampan moving in the vicinity of Subic Bay during the hours of darkness. After ignoring the challenge, the vessel was ordered to stop and shots were fired across its bow. &quot;Salmon&quot; then maneuvered for a closer inspection and saw that the sampan was displaying rising-sun emblems on her deckhouse and her crew was attempting to jettison objects over the side. &quot;Salmon&quot;″s crew fired at her with .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns. The vessel stopped and was boarded by &quot;Salmon&quot; crewmen who found that most of the Japanese sailors had gone over the side. They removed papers, radio equipment, and other articles, then set the sampan afire. As &quot;Salmon&quot; pulled away, the enemy vessel was seen to explode and sink.

On 17 November, off the approach to Manila Bay, &quot;Salmon&quot; sighted three vessels and maneuvered for attack. She fired torpedoes at each of the ships and succeeded in damaging two and sinking the 5,873-ton, converted salvage vessel, &quot;Oregon Maru&quot;. &quot;Salmon&quot; ended her fifth patrol on 7 December at Pearl Harbor. She then proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, the following day, and arrived on 13 December. &quot;Salmon&quot; remained at Mare Island until on 30 March 1943, undergoing alterations including the installation of new radar equipment and two 20 mm mounts to augment her firepower. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 April.

=== 1943 ===

&quot;Salmon&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor on 29 April 1943 for her sixth war patrol via Midway Island. She was assigned a special mission which took her to the coast of Honshū, Japan, at Hachijo-jima, Kajitorizaki (Kii Peninsula), and Izu Ōshima. During this mission, she damaged two freighters on 3 June and returned to Midway Island on 19 June.

&quot;Salmon&quot;″s seventh patrol was conducted in the Kuril Islands to cut the Paramushiro-Aleutian supply route. She departed from Midway Island on 17 July; sank a small coastal patrol vessel on 9 August, and, on 10 August sank the 2,411-ton passenger-cargo vessel, &quot;Wakanoura Maru&quot; off the northern coast of Hokkaidō. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 August.

&quot;Salmon&quot;″s eighth war patrol saw her return to the Kuril Islands where she was credited with damaging two freighters. This patrol lasted from 27 September to 17 November when she returned to Pearl Harbor.

=== 1944 ===

The ninth war patrol for &quot;Salmon&quot; was conducted between 15 December and on 25 February 1944. She succeeded in damaging one freighter on 22 January.

On 1 April, &quot;Salmon&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor en route to Johnston Island in company with the submarine . She was assigned a special photo reconnaissance mission for her tenth patrol which would assist in preparing plans for gaining control of the Caroline Islands. She conducted a reconnaissance of Ulithi from 15 to 20 April; Yap from 22 to 26 April; and Woleai between 28 April and 9 May. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 21 May with much valuable information that was utilized in last-minute changes to the assault plans.

&quot;Salmon&quot;″s eleventh and last war patrol was conducted in company with submarines and as a coordinated attack group in the Ryukyu Islands. This patrol began on 24 September. On 30 October, &quot;Salmon&quot; attacked a large tanker that had been previously damaged by &quot;Trigger&quot;. This tanker was protected by four antisubmarine patrol vessels which were cruising back and forth around the stricken ship. &quot;Salmon&quot; fired four torpedoes and made two good hits, but was forced to dive deep under a severe depth charge attack by escort &quot;CD-29&quot;. She leveled off at but was soon forced to nearly due to damage and additional pounding of the depth charges. Unable to control leaking and maintain depth level, she battle surfaced to fight for survival on the surface.

Escorts &quot;CD-22&quot; (the killer of ) and &quot;CD-33&quot; (which would later help sink &quot;Trigger&quot; on 28 March 1945) saw her surface and began to close. &quot;Salmon&quot; turned away to give her crew a few precious minutes to correct a bad list and to repair some of the damage. The vessels began to close, but &quot;Salmon&quot; showed an aggressive stance, turned on the attackers and passing within down the side of &quot;CD-22&quot;, raked her with 20 mm gunfire and her deck gun. &quot;CD-22&quot; suffered 4 killed and 24 wounded and was unable to reply because of the closeness of &quot;Salmon&quot; and her higher freeboard. &quot;Salmon&quot; began sending out plain language directions for all other subs in the vicinity to attack, giving the position of the action. This probably further discouraged the enemy who, fearing other submarines in the area, began milling around pinging on sound gear. &quot;Salmon&quot; took advantage of a rain squall and slipped away.

Other than the damage caused by depth charges, &quot;Salmon&quot; suffered only a few small-caliber hits from the enemy vessels. Escorted by &quot;Sterlet&quot;, &quot;Trigger&quot;, and , she made it to Saipan. She was given one-third credit for the 10,500-ton tanker, &quot;Jinei Maru&quot; which was eventually sunk by a torpedo from &quot;Sterlet&quot;. On 3 November, she moored alongside submarine tender , in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan.

=== 1945 ===

On 10 November, &quot;Salmon&quot; stood out from Saipan, in company with &quot;Holland&quot;, and sailed via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor to San Francisco. On 26 January 1945, she departed from San Francisco with the submarine and proceeded via the Panama Canal to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she arrived on 17 February.

After repairs and overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, &quot;Salmon&quot; was assigned as a training vessel for the Atlantic Fleet. After the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Salmon&quot; was slated for disposal and was decommissioned on 24 September. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October, she was scrapped on 4 April 1946. Her conning tower was used as the caisson for the Baker test during Operation Crossroads.

== Awards ==
* Presidential Unit Citation
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine battle stars for World War II service

&quot;Salmon&quot; was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism against enemy surface vessels during her eleventh war patrol in restricted, enemy-held waters of the Pacific.

<text>Queenston is a compact rural community and unincorporated place north of Niagara Falls in the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada. It is bordered by Highway 405 to the south and the Niagara River to the east; its location at the eponymous Queenston Heights on the Niagara Escarpment led to the establishment of the Queenston Quarry in the area. Across the river and the Canada–US border is the village of Lewiston, New York. The Lewiston-Queenston Bridge links the two communities.
This village is at the point where the Niagara River began eroding the Niagara Escarpment. During the ensuing 12,000 years the Falls cut an long gorge in the Escarpment southward to its present-day position.

In the early 19th century, the community&#x27;s name was spelled as Queenstown.

Queenston marks the southern terminus of the Bruce Trail. The cairn marking the trail&#x27;s terminus is in a parking lot, about 160 metres (520 ft) from General Brock&#x27;s Monument on the easterly side of the monument&#x27;s park grounds.

==History==

Queenston was first settled in the 1770s by Loyalist refugees and immigrants from the United States. By 1807, the village had 100 homes and a population of 300.

A new portage around Niagara Falls was developed in the 1780s with Queenston at its north end. Wharves, storehouses and a block-house were built. Initially called Lower Landing, it was named Queenston by Lieut.-Governor Simcoe. 

In 1793, a young black woman named Chloe Cooley was sold as a slave and forced across the Niagara River into the United States, an event witnessed by several Queenston locals. This incident became a catalyst for the passage of the Act Against Slavery in 1793 by the Upper Canada Executive Council, marking a significant step towards the abolition of slavery in the region. Despite charges against Cooley&#x27;s owner being dropped, the public outrage surrounding the event led Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe to push for legislation prohibiting the importation of slaves, resulting in the gradual abolition of slavery in Upper Canada. Today, Cooley&#x27;s legacy is commemorated with markers and recognition, including her designation as a National Historic Person, illustrating Queenston&#x27;s role in this pivotal moment in Canada&#x27;s history.

A great deal of fighting occurred here during the War of 1812, in the settlement and at nearby Fort George. In that era, Laura Secord lived in this area. Rebel William Lyon Mackenzie lived in Queenston in the 1820s and operated his publishing operation here.

On 13 October 1812, American troops took possession of Queenston Heights. Major-General Sir Isaac Brock arrived from Fort George, Ontario with a small force and was killed while trying to regain the heights. The British, Mohawk and militia troops under Major-General Roger Hale Sheaffe, with reinforcements from Chippawa, Ontario were able to take the hill and captured nearly 1000 prisoners. The victory and Brock&#x27;s death are commemorated by Brock&#x27;s Monument atop the Niagara Escarpment with a large stone statue of Brock overlooking the village below. Nearby is a smaller monument to Brock&#x27;s gray horse, Alfred, which may, or may not, have been at Queenston during the battle. Queenston Heights is one of the National Historic Sites of Canada, so recognized in June 1968.

The settlement of Queenston was destroyed on 10 December 1813. British Captain William Hamilton Merritt later said that he saw &quot;nothing but heaps of coals, and the streets full of furniture&quot;.

In the 1830s, Queenston was terminus for a first horse-drawn railway, the Erie and Ontario. The subsequent steam railroad that started in around 1854 bypassed Queenston.

In nearby St. David&#x27;s, the Queenston Quarry was founded in 1837, and for 150 years stone was shipped here to help build many of Ontario&#x27;s cities. Toronto buildings that benefitted from the supply of stone included Queen&#x27;s Park, the Royal Ontario Museum, Union Station and the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse.

By the mid-1800s, the Welland Canal became the primary method of shipping goods and the village of Queenston received little trade.

Queenston became part of the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1970.

RiverBrink Art Museum is located in Queenston. It is home to a unique collection of over 1,400 artworks and artefacts by Canadian and international artists, assembled by Samuel E. Weir. Completed in 1970, the building features Georgian-style architecture, including a mansard roof and gabled windows. It served as Weir&#x27;s country residence, and was converted into an art museum following his death in 1981.

<text>The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order Beloniformes, known colloquially as flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven genera. While they do not &quot;fly&quot; in the same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water&#x27;s surface. The main reason for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others, though their periods of flight expose them to attack by avian predators such as frigate birds.

Barbados is known as &quot;the land of the flying fish&quot; and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country. The Exocet missile is named after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take a low trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Exocoetidae&quot; is both the scientific name and the general name in Latin for a flying fish. The suffix &quot;-idae&quot;, common for indicating a family, follows the root of the Latin word , a transliteration of the Ancient Greek name . This means literally &#x27;sleeping outside&#x27;, from , &#x27;outside&#x27;, and , &#x27;bed&#x27;, &#x27;resting place&#x27;, with the verb root , &#x27;to lie down&#x27; (not &#x27;untruth&#x27;), so named as flying fish were believed to leave the water to sleep ashore, or due to flying fish flying and thus stranding themselves in boats.

==Taxonomy==
The Exocoetidae is divided into four subfamilies and seven genera:

* Subfamily Exocoetinae 
** Genus &quot;Exocoetus&quot; 
* Subfamily Fodiatorinae 
** Genus &quot;Fodiator&quot; 
* Subfamily Parexocoetinae 
** Genus &quot;Parexocoetus&quot; 
* Subfamily Cypsellurinae 
** Genus &quot;Cheilopogon&quot; 
** Genus &quot;Cypselurus&quot; 
** Genus &quot;Hirundichthys&quot; 
** Genus &quot;Prognichthys&quot; 

== Distribution and description ==

Flying fish live in all of the oceans, particularly in tropical and warm subtropical waters. They are commonly found in the epipelagic zone, the top layer of the ocean to a depth of about .

Numerous morphological features give flying fish the ability to leap above the surface of the ocean. One such feature is fully broadened neural arches, which act as insertion sites for connective tissues and ligaments in a fish&#x27;s skeleton. Fully broadened neural arches act as more stable and sturdier sites for these connections, creating a strong link between the vertebral column and cranium. A steady glide will improve their flight duration and allow them to be above water. An unsteady glide will not impact their flight as much but will shorten their flight duration not much more than a steady flight. This also will vary based on their energy consumption. This ultimately allows a rigid and sturdy vertebral column (body) that is beneficial in flight. Having a rigid body during glided flight gives the flying fish aerodynamic advantages, increasing its speed and improving its aim. Furthermore, flying fish have developed vertebral columns and ossified caudal complexes. These features provide the majority of strength to the flying fish, allowing them to physically lift their bodies out of water and glide remarkable distances. These additions also reduce the flexibility of the flying fish, allowing them to perform powerful leaps without weakening midair. At the end of a glide, they fold their pectoral fins to re-enter the sea, or drop their tails into the water to push against the water to lift for another glide, possibly changing direction. The curved profile of the &quot;wing&quot; is comparable to the aerodynamic shape of a bird wing. The fish is able to increase its time in the air by flying straight into or at an angle to the direction of updrafts created by a combination of air and ocean currents.

Species of genus &quot;Exocoetus&quot; have one pair of fins and streamlined bodies to optimize for speed, while &quot;Cypselurus&quot; spp. have flattened bodies and two pairs of fins, which maximize their time in the air. From 1900 to the 1930s, flying fish were studied as possible models used to develop airplanes.

The Exocoetidae feed mainly on plankton. Predators include dolphins, tuna, marlin, birds, squid, and porpoises.

=== Flight measurements ===
In May 2008, a Japanese television crew (NHK) filmed a flying fish (dubbed &quot;Icarfish&quot;) off the coast of Yakushima Island, Japan. The fish spent 45 seconds in flight. The previous record was 42 seconds.

The flights of flying fish are typically around , though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances up to . They can travel at speeds of more than . Maximum altitude is above the surface of the sea. Flying fish often accidentally land on the decks of smaller vessels.

== Fishery and cuisine ==

Flying fish are commercially fished in Japan, Vietnam, and China by gillnetting, and in Indonesia and India by dipnetting. Often in Japanese cuisine, the fish is preserved by drying to be used as fish stock for dashi broth. The roe of &quot;Cheilopogon agoo&quot;, or Japanese flying fish, is used to make some types of sushi, and is known as . It is also a staple in the diet of the Tao people of Orchid Island, Taiwan. Flying fish is part of the national dish of Barbados, &quot;cou-cou&quot; and flying fish. The taste is close to that of a sardine.
Flying fish roe is known as &quot;cau-cau&quot; in southern Peru, and is used to make several local dishes.

In the Solomon Islands, the fish are caught while they are flying, using nets held from outrigger canoes. They are attracted to the light of torches. Fishing is done only when no moonlight is available.

== Importance ==

=== Barbados ===

Barbados is known as &quot;the land of the flying fish&quot;, and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country. Once abundant, it migrated between the warm, coral-filled Atlantic Ocean surrounding the island of Barbados and the plankton-rich outflows of the Orinoco River in Venezuela.

Just after the completion of the Bridgetown Harbor / Deep Water Harbor in Bridgetown, Barbados had an increase of ship visits, linking the island to the world. The overall health of the coral reefs surrounding Barbados suffered due to ship-based pollution. Additionally, Barbadian overfishing pushed them closer to the Orinoco delta, no longer returning to Barbados in large numbers. Today, the flying fish only migrate as far north as Tobago, around southwest of Barbados. Despite the change, flying fish remain a coveted delicacy.

Many aspects of Barbadian culture center around the flying fish; it is depicted on coins, as sculptures in fountains, in artwork, and as part of the official logo of the Barbados Tourism Authority. Additionally, the Barbadian coat of arms features a pelican and dolphinfish on either side of the shield, but the dolphinfish resembles a flying fish. Furthermore, actual artistic renditions and holograms of the flying fish are also present within the Barbadian passport.

==== Maritime disputes ====

Flying fish have also been gaining in popularity in other islands, fueling several maritime disputes. In 2006, the council of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea fixed the maritime boundaries between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago over the flying fish dispute, which gradually raised tensions between the neighbours. The ruling stated both countries must preserve stocks for the future. Barbadian fishers still follow the flying fish southward.

===Indonesia===
Makassar fishermen in south Sulawesi have been catching flying fish (&quot;torani&quot;) in special boats called &quot;patorani&quot; for centuries developing their own sailing traditions along the way. These fishermen were able to sail as far as Kimberley region in west of Australia reaching the indigenous people there. The Indosiar channel was also prominently featured a flying fish in its logo during commercial breaks and on its ident only from 2000 to 2012.

== Prehistoric analogues ==

The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish are those of the extinct family Thoracopteridae, dating back to the Middle Triassic, 235–242 million years ago. However, they are thought to be basal neopterygians and are not related to modern flying fish, with the wing-like pectoral fins being convergently evolved in both lineages. Similarly, the Cheirothricidae of the Late Cretaceous also similarly evolved wing-like pectoral fins that were likely also used for gliding, but are indeterminate eurypterygians; they are possibly Aulopiformes, which would make them most closely related to lizardfish.

<text>A video camera is an optical instrument that captures videos, as opposed to a movie camera, which records images on film. Video cameras were initially developed for the television industry but have since become widely used for a variety of other purposes.

Video cameras are used primarily in two modes. The first, characteristic of much early broadcasting, is live television, where the camera feeds real time images directly to a screen for immediate observation. A few cameras still serve live television production, but most live connections are for security, military/tactical, and industrial operations where surreptitious or remote viewing is required. In the second mode the images are recorded to a storage device for archiving or further processing; for many years, videotape was the primary format used for this purpose, but was gradually supplanted by optical disc, hard disk, and then flash memory. Recorded video is used in television production, and more often surveillance and monitoring tasks in which unattended recording of a situation is required for later analysis.

==Types and uses==
Modern video cameras have numerous designs and use:
*Professional video cameras, such as those used in television production, may be television studio-based or mobile in the case of an electronic field production (EFP). Such cameras generally offer extremely fine-grained manual control for the camera operator, often to the exclusion of automated operation. They usually use three sensors to separately record red, green and blue.
* Camcorders combine a camera and a VCR or other recording device in one unit; these are mobile, and were widely used for television production, home movies, electronic news gathering (ENG) (including citizen journalism), and similar applications. Since the transition to digital video cameras, most cameras have in-built recording media and as such are also camcorders. Action cameras often have 360° recording capabilities.
* Closed-circuit television (CCTV) generally uses pan–tilt–zoom cameras (PTZ), for security, surveillance, and/or monitoring purposes. Such cameras are designed to be small, easily hidden, and able to operate unattended; those used in industrial or scientific settings are often meant for use in environments that are normally inaccessible or uncomfortable for humans, and are therefore hardened for such hostile environments (e.g. radiation, high heat, or toxic chemical exposure).
* Webcams are video cameras that stream a live video feed to a computer.
* Many smartphones have built-in video cameras and even high-end smartphones can capture video in 4K resolution.
* Special camera systems are used for scientific research, e.g. on board a satellite or a space probe, in artificial intelligence and robotics research, and in medical use. Such cameras are often tuned for non-visible radiation for infrared (for night vision and heat sensing) or X-ray (for medical and video astronomy use).

==History==
The earliest video cameras were based on the mechanical Nipkow disk and used in experimental broadcasts through the 1910s–1930s. All-electronic designs based on the video camera tube, such as Vladimir Zworykin&#x27;s Iconoscope and Philo Farnsworth&#x27;s image dissector, supplanted the Nipkow system by the 1930s. These remained in wide use until the 1980s, when cameras based on solid-state image sensors such as the charge-coupled device (CCD) and later CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) eliminated common problems with tube technologies such as image burn-in and streaking and made digital video workflow practical, since the output of the sensor is digital so it does not need conversion from analog.

The basis for solid-state image sensors is metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology, which originates from the invention of the MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) at Bell Labs in 1959. This led to the development of semiconductor image sensors, including the CCD and later the CMOS active-pixel sensor. The first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device, invented at Bell Labs in 1969, based on MOS capacitor technology. The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented at Olympus in 1985, which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993.

Practical digital video cameras were also enabled by advances in video compression, due to the impractically high memory and bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video. The most important compression algorithm in this regard is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique that was first proposed in 1972. Practical digital video cameras were enabled by DCT-based video compression standards, including the H.26x and MPEG video coding standards introduced from 1988 onwards.

The transition to digital television gave a boost to digital video cameras. By the early 21st century, most video cameras were digital cameras.

With the advent of digital video capture, the distinction between professional video cameras and movie cameras has disappeared as the intermittent mechanism has become the same. Nowadays, mid-range cameras exclusively used for television and other work (except movies) are termed professional video cameras.

==Recording media==

Early video could not be directly recorded. The first somewhat successful attempt to directly record video was in 1927 with John Logie Baird’s disc based Phonovision. The discs were unplayable with the technology of the time although later advances allowed the video to be recovered in the 1980s. The first experiments with using tape to record a video signal took place in 1951. The first commercially released system was Quadruplex videotape produced by Ampex in 1956. Two years later Ampex introduced a system capable of recording colour video. The first recording systems designed to be mobile (and thus usable outside the studio) were the Portapak systems starting with the Sony DV-2400 in 1967. This was followed in 1981 by the Betacam system where the tape recorder was built into the camera making a camcorder.

==Lens mounts==

While some video cameras have built in lenses, others use interchangeable lenses connected via a range of mounts. Some like Panavision PV and Arri PL are designed for movie cameras while others like Canon EF and Sony E come from still photography. A further set of mounts like S-mount exist for applications like CCTV.

<doc id="472646" wikidata="Q113707" url="?curid=472646" title="Yasmine Bleeth">
<text>Yasmine Bleeth (born June 14, 1968) is an American actress and model. Her television roles include Caroline Holden on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, Ryan Fenelli on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Inspector Caitlin Cross on Nash Bridges and LeeAnn Demerest on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Bleeth was born in New York City, the daughter of Carina, a model, and Philip Bleeth, a business proprietor. Her father Philip is of Russian-Jewish and German-Jewish descent. Her mother was a Pied-Noir from Algeria, with French ancestry; she was Catholic. Phil Bleeth was associated with a group of friends that included Arlo Guthrie and Alice Brock (of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; fame) around the time of Yasmine&#x27;s birth. Yasmine&#x27;s earliest known acting role was in a Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s No More Tears baby shampoo television commercial at age 10 months in 1969. At the age of 6, she appeared on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. Later that year she appeared in a Max Factor cosmetic advertising campaign with model Cristina Ferrare. Her work in this campaign caught the eye of fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo, who subsequently included her and her mother in his book entitled &quot;Scavullo Women&quot;. 

&quot;Total Film&quot; magazine quoted Bleeth stating, &quot;When I was a little girl I used to have to force boys to kiss me. My toughest friend had to hold them down.&quot;

In 1980, 12-year-old Bleeth was cast in her first film role, opposite Buddy Hackett in the feature film &quot;Hey Babe!&quot;. In 1983, she was in a commercial with Puerto Rican group Menudo. At age 16, she began appearing as grown up Ryan Fenelli on the daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; in February 1985 until the soap&#x27;s final episode on January 13, 1989. A few months after that show&#x27;s 1989 cancellation, Bleeth&#x27;s mother, Carina Bleeth, was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. She died within a year at the age of 47, after which Bleeth dealt with her grief, thus: &quot;I stayed home, watching cooking shows, taking walks.&quot; She turned down acting offers for eight months, but then won the role of LeeAnn Demerest on the daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

==Later career==
Bleeth&#x27;s role of Caroline Holden on &quot;Baywatch&quot; brought her widespread attention. &quot;People&quot; named her one of magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People in 1995. She was one of &quot;FHM&#x27;&quot;s 100 Sexiest Women in the World every year from 1996 to 2001, and &quot;FHM&#x27;&quot;s U.S. 100 Sexiest Women every year from 2000 to 2003. As a result of her role in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, Bleeth was offered other roles in television and film. She has been a featured actress in five series and has guest-starred in other shows. During her television career, she continued to work as a model, frequently appearing in swimwear or lingerie. She once had her own line of swimwear called &quot;Yaz Wear.&quot; From 1998 to 2000, Bleeth played the role of inspector Caitlin Cross on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;.

Bleeth accepted a starring role in the short-lived series &quot;Titans&quot; in 2000. Aaron Spelling was so eager to cast Bleeth in the role of a vixen on &quot;Titans&quot; that his company convinced CBS to grant her an early release from her &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; contract. In an interview with Dennis Hensley, she said she delighted in her over-the-top depiction of a crazed beauty queen in the 1997 TV film &quot;Crowned and Dangerous&quot;. She said, &quot;I keep my crown from that film on my desk in a little Lucite box. My little brother tried it on once, and I screamed at him, &#x27;Take it off! Take it off!&#x27; I get a little nasty about my crown.&quot;

She is mentioned in popular TV series &quot;Friends&quot; multiple times, especially by Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani. She appears in the popular TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot;.

Following her first effort in a drug rehabilitation clinic in late 2000 (see below), Bleeth only shot one more performance, the 2003 television film &quot;&quot;.

Bleeth eventually made her comeback after a lengthy hiatus with a 2021 indie comedy &quot;Whack the Don&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bleeth met her future husband, strip club owner Paul Cerrito, in December 2000 when she voluntarily entered the Malibu-based Promises Rehabilitation Clinic to overcome a cocaine dependence. Bleeth would later comment, &quot;They say you shouldn&#x27;t get into any relationship in the first year of sobriety — especially with someone in the program, but Paul and I fell in love immediately.&quot; They were married in Santa Barbara, California, on August 25, 2002, and now live in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Arizona. Bleeth and Cerrito do not have children.

===Charity work===
Bleeth was the 1998 spokesperson for the Lee National Denim Day fundraising campaign, which raises millions of dollars for breast cancer research and education. On October 9, 1998, it was called the &quot;Wear Jeans to Work&quot; campaign. With Bleeth&#x27;s help, $5 million was raised on that one day to help Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

===Cocaine addiction and arrest===
In December 2000, Bleeth voluntarily entered the Malibu-based Promises Rehabilitation Clinic to overcome a cocaine dependence. On September 12, 2001, Bleeth was arrested in Romulus, Michigan, after she drove her car off the highway onto a median strip on Interstate 94 as she and her future husband, Paul Cerrito, were heading to Detroit Metropolitan Airport. No other cars were involved. Police found four syringes with an injectable form of cocaine in them and a small plastic bag with cocaine residue on it. The next day police conducted a search of her hotel room, where they discovered more cocaine and drug paraphernalia. In November 2001, through a plea bargain, Bleeth pleaded guilty to possessing less than 25 grams of cocaine and to driving while impaired. She was sentenced in January 2002 to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service. 

Bleeth&#x27;s lawyer, Jerry Sabbota, stated after sentencing that the actress was satisfied with the plea bargain, noting that her record will be cleared of any felonies after she fulfills the terms of her probation. &quot;When all is said and done she&#x27;ll have a traffic ticket on her record. She wasn&#x27;t treated any better than anyone else, and she wasn&#x27;t treated any worse,&quot; Sabbota said. Her attorney stated that Bleeth was receiving therapy from the founder of the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic that she had previously attended in 2000. Bleeth completely fulfilled the terms of her probation as of January 2004, and her record was cleared as determined by the plea bargain. In an issue of &quot;Glamour&quot; from April 2003, Bleeth wrote a three-page article titled &quot;Back from My Drugs Hell&quot; about her rocky path to recovery, her cocaine addiction, and her struggle to remain sober. Bleeth wrote that her cocaine habit was so severe that she collapsed at a photo shoot for &quot;Glamour&quot;, and she went without sleep for five days at a time. She wrote that &quot;consciously trying to stay off drugs is now part of my life and always will be&quot;.

<doc id="472652" wikidata="Q749988" url="?curid=472652" title="The City of Lost Children">
<text>The City of Lost Children () is a 1995 science fantasy film directed by Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, written by Jeunet and Gilles Adrien, and starring Ron Perlman. An international co-production of companies from France, Germany, and Spain, the film is stylistically related to the previous and subsequent Jeunet films, &quot;Delicatessen&quot; (1991) and &quot;Amélie&quot; (2001).

The musical score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. It was entered into the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
Krank (Daniel Emilfork), a highly intelligent but malicious being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist&#x27;s other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin) he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, whom in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denrée (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman).

After the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of conjoined twins called &quot;the Octopus&quot;) to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denrée&#x27;s kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her.

Miette leaves the diver&#x27;s lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive, the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However, the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello&#x27;s stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette&#x27;s tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denrée.

Back at Krank&#x27;s oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denrée.

Miette is almost killed by Martha, who is harpooned to death by the diver, pretending her &quot;allergy to iron&quot;. Miette then finds Denrée asleep in Krank&#x27;s dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank&#x27;s mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the blasting machine, blowing up him and the rig.

==Reception==
The film holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Not all of its many intriguing ideas are developed, but &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; is an engrossing, disturbing, profoundly memorable experience.&quot; It also holds a weighted average score of 73 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film&#x27;s design and visual effects deserved the highest possible praise but the story was sometimes confusing: &quot;I would be lying if I said I understood the plot.&quot;

===Interpretation===
According to authors Jen Webb and Tony Schirato, the dual nature of capitalism constitutes a main source of tension in the film:

According to author Donna Wilkerson-Barker, these elusive aspects of humanity are presented within the film for various characters to identify with. For example, the relationship between One and Denrée represents, for Miette, a family of authenticity. Prepared to sacrifice her life in order to become a part of their family, Miette helps One to save Denrée from Krank&#x27;s manipulative environment. In another example, Irvin the brain plays his part in overturning the same environment in order to liberate his &quot;family&quot; of clones. In the end, two boats filled with these two different families row towards their futures: In one boat, a technologically produced family of Irvin and the clones; In the other, a rationally envisioned family containing Miette, One, and the abducted children. This leaves the audience to question precisely what the future will hold for these two differing visions of humanity.

As &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; &quot;proceeds in full awareness that the past to which it is committed never really existed&quot;, the film has been classified as an example of the steampunk genre.

<text>The Caps () were a political faction during the Age of Liberty (1719–1772) in Sweden. The primary rivals of the Caps were known as the Hats. The Hats are actually responsible for the Caps&#x27; name, as it comes from a contraction of Night-cap, a name used to suggest that the Caps were the soft and timid party. The Caps represented mostly peasants and clergymen.

==Policy==
The foremost representative of the Age of Liberty, &quot;de facto&quot; leader of government and of the Caps from 1719 to 1738 was the Chancery President, Count Arvid Horn. Horn reversed the traditional policy of Sweden by keeping the Kingdom of France at a distance and drawing near to Russia. Thus a twenty years&#x27; war was succeeded by a twenty years&#x27; peace, during which the nation recovered so rapidly from its wounds that it began to forget them.

The Riksdag of 1738 was to mark a turning-point in Swedish history, the Hats carried everything before them, and the aged Horn was finally compelled to retire from a scene where, for thirty-three years, he had played a leading part. For the next twenty five years the Hats did dominate government, with disastrous results where the country was plunged into two costly and ill-advised wars.

At the Riksdag in 1765, the Caps returned to government and they struck at once at the weak point of their opponents by ordering a budget report to be made, and it was speedily found that the whole financial system of the Hats had been based upon reckless imprudence and the wilful misrepresentation and that the only fruit of their long rule was an enormous addition to the national debt and a depreciation of the note circulation to one third of its face value. This revelation led to an all-round retrenchment, carried into effect with a drastic thoroughness which has earned for this parliament the name of the &quot;Reduction Riksdag&quot;. The Caps succeeded in reducing the national debt, half of which was transferred from the pockets of the rich to the empty exchequer, and establishing some sort of equilibrium between revenue and expenditure. They also introduced a few useful reforms, the most remarkable of which was the liberty of the press in 1766. However, their most important political act was to throw their lot definitely in with the Russian Empire, so as to counterpoise the influence of France.

==Majority leaders==
These representatives of the Caps were elected as Lantmarskalk (speakers) of the Riksdag of the Estates, signifying a parliamentary majority.

*Arvid Horn (1720, 1726, 1731)
*Swen Lagerberg (1723)
*Mattias Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg (1742, 1746)

<doc id="472662" wikidata="Q5630394" url="?curid=472662" title="HMAS Kiama">
<text>HMAS &quot;Kiama&quot;, named for the coastal town of Kiama, New South Wales, was one of 60 s constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

After World War II, the corvette was one of four sold to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). She served as HMNZS &quot;Kiama&quot; from 1952 until 1976, when the corvette was paid off and marked for disposal.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Kiama&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Kiama&quot; was constructed by Evans Deakin &amp; Co, at Brisbane, Queensland. She was laid down on 2 November 1942, and launched on 3 July 1943 by Mrs. G. Lawson, wife of the Minister for Transport. &quot;Kiama&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 26 January 1944. The coastal community of Kiama, after which the vessel was named, donated recreational materiel for her crew including a radio set, books, and a 16 mm movie projector.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
&quot;Kiama&quot;″s first deployment was in March 1944 to Milne Bay in New Guinea. From her arrival until September 1944, the corvette&#x27;s main duty was to escort convoys along the New Guinea coastline, although a reassignment for the duration of June saw &quot;Kiama&quot; perform anti-submarine patrols in the Solomon Sea. In September, &quot;Kiama&quot; was used to transport soldiers between New Guinea and New Britain. On conclusion, she resumed her convoy escort role until the end of 1944, when she departed for Sydney. During her eight months in New Guinea waters, &quot;Kiama&quot; travelled over , was at sea for more than 3,000 hours.
In September 1944 &#x27;C&#x27; Troop and a small detachment from &#x27;B&#x27; Troop, from the 2/8th Commando Squadron were landed from HMAS Kiama on a reconnaissance operation at Jacquinot Bay on the island of New Britain, to collect intelligence in preparation for an assault by the 5th Division.

The corvette arrived in Sydney on 21 December 1944. On 25 December, the crew was recalled from leave to go to the assistance of the liberty ship , which had been torpedoed by German submarine . &quot;Kiama&quot;, along with , , and were dispatched to the last known location of the ship and began to search the area for the liberty ship&#x27;s crew and the attacking submarine; finding the 67 survivors of the attack at 05:45 on 26 December but failing to locate &quot;U-862&quot;. &quot;Kiama&quot; was assigned to anti-submarine patrols near Sydney for the final days of the year, before sailing to Adelaide for a month-long refit on 3 January 1945.

Post-refit, &quot;Kiama&quot; was assigned to Fremantle for two months of anti-submarine warfare exercises with the United States Navy, before returning to New Guinea on 7 May 1945. In May and June, the corvette performed several coastal bombardments in the Bougainville area. In July, &quot;Kiama&quot; transported Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, then spent the rest of the month moving troops and military cargo between these two locations. From 5 to 24 August, the corvette was based in Brisbane, before returning to New Guinea waters. &quot;Kiama&quot; spent the rest of 1945 as a troop and supply transport, minesweeper, and general duties vessel. When the war ended, &quot;Kiama&quot; took part in the Japanese surrender at Rabaul. In November, &quot;Kiama&quot; was assigned to escort demilitarized Japanese cruiser as the cruiser embarked Japanese soldiers in New Guinea for repatriation.

&quot;Kiama&quot; returned to Sydney on 29 January 1946. In February she paid a six-day farewell visit to the town of Kiama, ahead of her decommission into the Reserve on 3 April. During her wartime service, the ship had been at sea for 6,369 hours, and had sailed a distance of . She earned two battle honours: &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;.

===Transfer to RNZN===
On 5 March 1952, &quot;Kiama&quot; and three other &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes (, , and ) were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy. &quot;Kiama&quot; was commissioned into the RNZN, receiving the prefix HMNZS. Upon acquisition by New Zealand, the corvette was converted into a training ship. &quot;Kiama&quot;″s 4-inch gun and aft minesweeping equipment were removed, and replaced with two 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns. This is contradicted by a 1996 newspaper article which said it had been mothballed by the New Zealand Navy and converted to a training ship and for use on fisheries patrols in 1966.

In 1966, &quot;Kiama&quot; was re-commissioned under command of Lieutenant-Commander E Burrows in the 27th Fisheries Protection Squadron to join her sister ship HMNZS Inverell. Other duties included search-and-rescue operations and transportation of scientific teams to small island along New Zealand&#x27;s coastline.

In May 1966 the &quot;Kiama&quot; was involved in the search for the &quot;Kaitawa&quot; which was lost with all hands near 90 mile beach. Apart from the initial search, the &quot;Kiama&quot; formed part of &quot;Operation Seabed&quot;, along with the &quot;Inverell&quot; and the frigate &quot;Taranaki&quot;.

The corvette revisited her namesake town in Australia in late 1966.

===RNZN Commanders===
* 1966 Lt Commander E Burrows
* 1967 Lt-commander M C Verran
* 1968 Lt-Commander L J Tempero
* 1970 Lt-Commander F D Arnott
* 1971 Lt-Commander D L Douglas
* 1973 Lt Commander N Cameron

==Fate==
On 27 May 1968 the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral J O Ross, described the &quot;Kiama&quot; and &quot;Inverell&quot; as obsolete and no longer fit for purpose. The &quot;Kiama&quot; remained in service until 1975 when it was placed in reserve. The ship was paid off for disposal on 19 August 1976 and broken up in 1979.

<doc id="472664" wikidata="Q379757" url="?curid=472664" title="Advanced Visualization Studio">
<text>Advanced Visualization Studio (AVS), is a music visualization plugin for Winamp. It was designed by Winamp creator, Justin Frankel and was first shipped in version 2.0a4 with Winamp 2.61. &quot;AVS&quot; has a customizable design which allows users to create their own visualization effects, or &quot;presets&quot;. &quot;AVS&quot; was made open source software in May 2005, released under a BSD-style license. AVS is currently at version 2.83 and is included with Winamp, though the distributed version has later been reverted due to compatibility issues. Winamp currently ships with version 2.82 for Windows Vista (and later) and 2.81d for older Windows versions.

== History ==

=== Initial releases ===

The first versions of AVS came with a set of pre-defined effects that could be arranged in any combination. Later versions introduced codeable components, most notably the &quot;SuperScope&quot; render effect and &quot;Dynamic Movement&quot;. The AVS plugin-in can be extended itself with AVS Plugin Effects (APE).

Version 2.81b of AVS was released by Nullsoft in 2003. It was faster and added several new features like arrays and interactivity in visualizations. 2.82 is the current stable release after some minor updates by Darren &quot;DrO&quot; Owen. For a short period, version 2.83 was distributed, a decision that was eventually reversed due to incompatibilities.

=== Open-source and third-party versions ===
On May 18, 2005, it was announced that AVS would now be open source software, released under a BSD-style license.

Long after having left the company, Nullsoft founder Justin Frankel released a fork in August 2010 of the plug-in, titled &quot;Cockos Happy AVS&quot;. It was first released as version 2.9, continuing the version scheme where the official version left off.

As of October 2013, AVS presets can be played directly in the browser using the Webvs visualizer. However, only a small subset of effects is supported at this point.

=== Acquisition by Radionomy ===

With the release of Winamp version 5.66 on November 20, 2013, AOL announced that Winamp.com would shut down on December 20, 2013, and Winamp and its components would cease to be offered for download after that date. Resulting in the shutdown, many AVS downloads will be lost. The AVS Archive is an attempt to preserve some of the more popular AVS packs. The following day, an unofficial report surfaced that Microsoft was in talks with AOL to acquire Nullsoft. Despite AOL&#x27;s announcement, the Winamp site was not shut down as planned, and on January 14, 2014, AOL sold Nullsoft to Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy; no financial details were publicly announced. In fear of a shutdown, a mirror of the Winamp-hosted AVS forums has been published on GitHub.

== Making presets ==

Every preset is made up of different components. There are three categories of components: Render, Trans and Misc. Render draws shapes, Trans transforms the current image and Misc contains the components that don&#x27;t fit in other two categories. The components are plugged into a list, which is executed from top to bottom, each component doing something with the image and sending the result to the next one. A lot of components are configurable and a few are codable. Effect lists can be included, which act as presets within presets.

=== Codeable components ===

The codable components allow the most customizability, when a preset author can control and program effects through AVS&#x27; simple scripting language. The scripting language is compiled to native code at runtime for maximum performance.

The following components can be scripted:
*Superscope
*Triangles
*Texer II
*Movement
*Dynamic Movement
*Dynamic Distance Modifier
*Dynamic Shift
*Bump
*Effect List
*Global Variable Manager

User-generated presets may be featured on websites such as Winamp.com, DeviantArt or customize.org.

<text>Greyfriars Bobby (4 May 1855 – 14 January 1872) was a Skye Terrier or Dandie Dinmont Terrier who became known in 19th-century Edinburgh for spending 14 years guarding the grave of his owner until his death on 14 January 1872. The story continues to be well known in Scotland, through several books and films. A prominent commemorative statue and nearby graves are a tourist attraction.

==Traditional view==
The best-known version of the story is that Bobby belonged to John Gray, who worked for the Edinburgh City Police as a nightwatchman. When John Gray died he was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, the kirkyard surrounding Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town of Edinburgh. Bobby then became known locally, spending the rest of his life sitting on his master&#x27;s grave.

In 1867 the lord provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers, who was also a director of the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, paid for Bobby&#x27;s licence and gave the dog a collar, now in the Museum of Edinburgh.

Bobby is said to have sat by the grave for 14 years. He died in 1872 and a necropsy by Prof Thomas Walley of the Edinburgh Veterinary College concluded he had died from cancer of the jaw.

He was buried just inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from John Gray&#x27;s grave.

A year later, the English philanthropist Lady Burdett-Coutts was charmed by the story and had a drinking fountain topped with Bobby&#x27;s statue (commissioned from the sculptor William Brodie) erected at the junction of George IV Bridge and Candlemaker Row (opposite the entrance to the churchyard) to commemorate him.

===John Gray===

John Gray (died 15 February 1858) commonly known in popular culture as Auld Jock, was a gardener who came to Edinburgh in 1850 with his wife Jess and son John. He avoided working in a workhouse by joining the Edinburgh City Police as a nightwatchman. Around this time he looked after Greyfriars Bobby. Bobby would follow John Gray whilst he was at work. According to records, policemen were obliged to have watchdogs with them. John Traill claimed that John Gray was a farmer who regularly visited his coffee house at the one o&#x27;clock gun, though this might have been embellished as Traill didn&#x27;t own the coffee house until four years after John Gray died. Gray reportedly died of tuberculosis on 15 February 1858 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. For 14 years, the dog stayed at his master&#x27;s graveside.

In January 2018, his grave was toppled by vandals. George Robinson of the One O&#x27;Clock Gun Association said &quot;There are guys wandering around there totally out of their mind. You can&#x27;t control that.&quot;

==Alternative views==

The accuracy of stories of Greyfriars Bobby has been challenged many times: for instance, in Forbes Macgregor&#x27;s &quot;Greyfriars Bobby: The Real Story at Last&quot;, Jan Bondeson&#x27;s &quot;Greyfriars Bobby: The Most Faithful Dog in the World&quot;, and Richard Brassey&#x27;s &quot;Greyfriars Bobby The Most Famous Dog in Scotland&quot;.

Questions about the story&#x27;s accuracy are not new. In a newspaper article in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Greyfriars Bobby A Dog&#x27;s Devotion&quot; (11 August 1934), Councillor Wilson McLaren responds to contemporary questions about the accuracy of the stories by describing his own conversation, in 1871, with &quot;Mr Traill&quot; of &quot;Traill&#x27;s Coffee House&quot; in relation to the dog he himself was then feeding, reassuring readers about the story Mr Traill had given him, and describing responses in 1889 to questions about the story&#x27;s accuracy. A sense of the difficulty of determining accuracy is gained from two opposing letters to &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper on 8 February 1889 (part of the debate referred to by McLaren), both from people claiming close links to Greyfriars Kirk, both claiming to have known of the dog personally but with opposing views over the accuracy of stories.

A common discussion is over which of two people named John Gray was the real owner of Bobby (one being a night watchman and the other a farmer). In Councillor McLaren&#x27;s account, Mr Traill in 1871 had spoken about John Gray the farmer.

Jan Bondeson&#x27;s book advances the view that fundamental facts about the dog and its loyalty are wrong. Bondeson states as background that in 19th-century Europe, there are over 60 documented accounts of graveyard or cemetery dogs. They were stray dogs, fed by visitors and curators to the point that the dogs made the graveyards their home. People began to believe that they were waiting by a grave and so the dog was looked after. Bondeson claims that after an article about Bobby appeared in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, visitor numbers to the graveyard increased, which supposedly created a commercial benefit for the local community. Bondeson also speculates that in 1867, the original Bobby died and was replaced with a younger dog, which explains Bobby&#x27;s supposed longevity.

According to a book published in 2022, Bobby was more likely to have been a dandie dinmont terrier than a Skye terrier as is generally supposed. The claim was made by Mike Macbeth, president of the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club of Canada. Macbeth pointed out that the dandie dinmont terrier was extremely popular in Scotland at the time, with some 60 breeders in the Edinburgh area, whereas skye terriers tended to be confined to the Isle of Skye.

==Memorials==

* Greyfriars Bobby Fountain, the fountain includes a life-size statue of Greyfriars Bobby created by William Brodie in 1872, financed by Baroness Burdett-Coutts of the Coutts banking family. The monument is Edinburgh&#x27;s smallest listed structure.
* Greyfriars Bobby&#x27;s Bar, a pub located on the ground floor of the Candlemaker Row&#x27;s houses.
* Greyfriars Bobby&#x27;s headstone, the headstone was erected by The Dog Aid Society of Scotland and unveiled by the Duke of Gloucester on 13 May 1981. The monument reads, &quot;Greyfriars Bobby – Died 14 January 1872 – Aged 16 years – Let his loyalty and devotion be a lesson to us all&quot;.
* In 2021 a new monument to mark the 150th anniversary of the dog’s death was placed close to the east wall of Greyfriars Kirk. This was ordered by Robbie Beattie, a senior manager with Edinburgh City Council&#x27;s Bereavement Service. No consultation or conventional commissioning process was undertaken, despite the Kirkyard lying within a UNESCO World Heritage site.
==Books and films directly about Bobby==
* The 1902 historical account, &quot;The True Story of Greyfriars Bobby&quot; by Henry T. Hutton, Publisher: Edinburgh
* The 1912 novel &quot;Greyfriars Bobby&quot; by Eleanor Atkinson embellished the story and made John Gray a shepherd, known as &quot;Auld Jock&quot;. The 1961 Walt Disney film &quot;Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog&quot; was based on the book and has a Skye Terrier as Greyfriars Bobby.
* &quot;The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby&quot;, another film, was released in the UK in February 2006 starring James Cosmo and Christopher Lee (released elsewhere in 2005 under the alternative title &quot;Greyfriars Bobby&quot;). The Edinburgh Castle scenes in this film were actually shot at Stirling Castle. Many expressed reservations that a West Highland Terrier was cast as Bobby, and that new characters were added while one of the major characters in Bobby&#x27;s life, John Traill, was omitted.

==Other references in popular culture==
*A British Rail class 47 number 47711 was named &quot;Greyfriars Bobby&quot; in 1981. One of the original nameplates now sits above the sales counter at Harburn Hobbies model shop in Edinburgh.
* &quot;Challenge to Lassie&quot; (1949), is an earlier film based on Atkinson&#x27;s book, replacing Bobby with Lassie.
* The 1945 film &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;, has an oblique reference to Bobby. The title character John Gray, played by Boris Karloff, while seeking to dig up a corpse in Greyfriars Kirkyard, encounters a dog (named &quot;Robbie&quot;) guarding the grave. The dog is killed.
* In 1964, popular Scottish duo The Alexander Brothers recorded a song &#x27;Greyfriars Bobby&#x27; on Pye Records which refers to Bobby being loyal to a shepherd.
* Gaspode, a talking dog in the &quot;Discworld&quot; fantasy novels of Terry Pratchett, claims to be named after a famous dog named Gaspode with a similar story to Greyfriars Bobby, though he says it was later discovered that the reason this Gaspode stayed howling by his master&#x27;s grave was that his tail was trapped under the gravestone.
* In 2019, the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh did a production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; that relocated the events of the tale to Edinburgh a year after Auld Jock&#x27;s death, attributing the old man&#x27;s death to his being evicted by Scrooge. Bobby is depicted in the play by a puppet, and is shown to be friends with Tiny Tim (also portrayed by a puppet); Scrooge&#x27;s vision of the future sees Bobby being taken by the dog-catcher after Tiny Tim&#x27;s death means there is nobody to warn Bobby. The play concludes with Scrooge using a gift left behind by the Spirit of Christmas Nooadays (the Scots equivalent of the Ghost of Christmas Present) to provide Bobby&#x27;s licence, thus protecting him from the dog-catcher.
*The music video for Scottish musician Lewis Capaldi&#x27;s song &quot;Wish You the Best&quot; features a storyline based on Greyfriars Bobby.
* In the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, developed by Edinburgh-based studio Rockstar North, a dog (either a Skye Terrier or West Highland Terrier) can be seen visiting a headstone at the Vinewood cemetery on a daily basis.

<doc id="472667" wikidata="Q12809489" url="?curid=472667" title="Marriage license">
<text>A marriage license (or marriage licence in Commonwealth spelling) is a document issued, either by a religious organization or state authority, authorizing a couple to marry. The procedure for obtaining a license varies between jurisdictions, and has changed over time. Marriage licenses began to be issued in the Middle Ages, to permit a marriage that would otherwise be illegal (for instance, if the necessary period of notice for the marriage had not been given).

Today, they are a legal requirement in some jurisdictions and may also serve as the record of the marriage itself, if signed by the couple and witnessed. In other jurisdictions, a license is not required. In some jurisdictions, a &quot;pardon&quot; can be obtained for marrying without a license, and in some jurisdictions, common-law marriages and marriage by cohabitation and representation are also recognized. These do not require a marriage license. There are also some jurisdictions where marriage licenses do not exist at all and a marriage certificate is given to the couple after the marriage ceremony has taken place.

==History==

Some states in the US hold that public cohabitation can be sufficient evidence of a valid marriage. Marriage license application records from government authorities are widely available starting from the mid-19th century. Some are available dating from the 17th century in colonial America. Marriage licenses have been required since 1639 in Massachusetts, with their use gradually expanding to other jurisdictions.

==Australia ==

In Australia, there is no requirement to obtain a marriage license. However, a person under the age of 18 requires the authorisation of a judge to marry. Couples must provide their marriage celebrant with a Notice of Intended Marriage at least one month and up to 18 months before a wedding.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
A requirement for banns of marriage was introduced to England and Wales by the Church in 1215. This required a public announcement of a forthcoming marriage, in the couple&#x27;s parish church, for three Sundays prior to the wedding and gave an opportunity for any objections to the marriage to be voiced (for example, that one of the parties was already married or that the couple was related within a prohibited degree), but a failure to call banns did not affect the validity of the marriage.

Marriage licences were introduced in the 14th century, to allow the usual notice period under banns to be waived, on payment of a fee (see Droit du seigneur and merchet) and accompanied by a sworn declaration, that there was no canonical impediment to the marriage . Licences were usually granted by an archbishop, bishop or archdeacon. There could be a number of reasons for a couple to obtain a licence: they might wish to marry quickly (and avoid the three weeks&#x27; delay by the calling of banns); they might wish to marry in a parish away from their home parish; or, because a licence required a higher payment than banns, they might choose to obtain one as a status symbol.

There were two kinds of marriage licences that could be issued: the usual was known as a &quot;common licence&quot; and named one or two parishes where the wedding could take place, within the jurisdiction of the person who issued the licence. The other was the &quot;special licence&quot;, which could only be granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury or his officials and allowed the marriage to take place in any church.

Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act 1753 affirmed this existing ecclesiastical law and built it into statutory law. From this date, a marriage was only legally valid, if it followed the calling of banns in church or the obtaining of a licence—the only exceptions being Jewish and Quaker marriages, whose legality was also recognised. From the date of Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act up to 1837, the ceremony was required to be performed in a consecrated building.

Since 1 July 1837, civil marriages have been a legal alternative to church marriages under the Marriage Act 1836, which provided the statutory basis for regulating and recording marriages. So, today, a couple has a choice between being married in the Anglican Church, after the calling of banns or obtaining a common or special licence or else, they can give &quot;Notice of Marriage&quot; to a civil registrar. In this latter case, the notice is publicly posted for 15 days, after which a civil marriage can take place. Marriages may take place in churches other than Anglican churches, but these are governed by civil marriage law and notice must be given to the civil registrar in the same way. The marriage may then take place without a registrar being present if the church itself is registered for marriages and the minister or priest is an Authorised Person for marriages.

The licence does not record the marriage itself, only the permission for a marriage to take place. Since 1837, the proof of a marriage has been by a marriage certificate, issued at the ceremony; before then, it was by the recording of the marriage in a parish register.

The provisions on civil marriage in the 1836 Act were repealed by the Marriage Act 1949. The Marriage Act 1949 re-enacted and re-stated the law on marriage in England and Wales.

===Scotland===
Marriage law and practice in Scotland differs from that in England and Wales. Historically, it was always considered legal and binding for a couple to marry by making public promises, without a formal ceremony but this form has not been available since 1940. More recently &quot;marriage by cohabitation with repute&quot; has also been abolished for any relationship commenced since 2006. Church marriages &quot;without proclamation&quot; are somewhat analogous to the English &quot;marriages by licence&quot;, although the permission to perform them is not a church matter. Religious marriages in Scotland have never had a restriction on the place in which they are performed. 
Marriages in Scotland normally require between 2 and 6 weeks&#x27; notice to the district registrar depending on the previous marital status and other procedural matters usually involving the country of residence and the nationality of the parties. Marriages with less than the normal amount of notice require the permission of the Registrar General.

==United States==
In the United States, until the mid-19th century, common-law marriages were recognized as valid, but thereafter some states began to invalidate common-law marriages. Common-law marriages, if recognized by law, are valid, notwithstanding the absence of a marriage license; this becomes an issue in the settlement of decedents&#x27; estates. North Carolina and Tennessee (which was originally western North Carolina) never recognized marriage at the common law as valid without a license unless entered into in other states. They have always recognized otherwise valid marriages (except bigamous, polygamous, interracial, or same-sex) entered into in conformity with the law of other states, territories and nations.

The specifications for obtaining a marriage license vary between states. In general, however, both parties must appear in person at the time the license is obtained; be of marriageable age (i.e., over 18 years; lower in some states with the consent of a parent); present proper identification (typically a driver&#x27;s license, state ID card, birth certificate or passport; more documentation may be required for those born outside of the United States); and neither must be married to anyone else (proof of spouse&#x27;s death or divorce may be required for someone who had been previously married in some states).

The US states of Louisiana, Florida, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Mississippi, California, New York, and the District of Columbia once required blood tests before issuing a marriage license, but such requirements have since been abolished. The tests were mainly used to check for previous or current bouts of syphilis and rubella (German measles); other diseases that have been screened for before marriage in some cases have included tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and HIV, the last of which is the only one of those three that is detectable using a blood test.

Many states require 1 to 6 days to pass between the granting of the license and the marriage ceremony. After the marriage ceremony, both spouses and the officiant sign the marriage license (some states also require one or two witnesses). The officiant or couple then files for a certified copy of the marriage license and a marriage certificate with the appropriate authority. Some states also have a requirement that a license be filed within a certain time after its issuance, typically 30 or 60 days, following which a new license must be obtained.

Marriage licenses in the United States fall under the jurisdiction of the state in which the ceremony is performed; however, the marriage is generally recognized across the country. The state in which they are married holds the record of that marriage. Traditionally, working with law enforcement was the only means of searching and accessing marriage license information across state lines.

In Alabama, a law was passed in 2019 which abolished the issuance of marriage licenses and repealed a requirement for solemnization. Instead, couples of legal age are allowed to jointly fill out a marriage certificate, have their certificate notarized by two notaries public, and submit their certificate to an Alabama judge, who is required to accept their certificate. 

===Controversy in the U.S.===
Some groups and individuals believe that the requirement to obtain a marriage license is unnecessary or immoral. The Libertarian Party, for instance, believes that marriage should be a matter of personal liberty, not requiring permission from the state. 
Individuals who align with this libertarian stance argue that marriage is a right, and that by allowing the state to exercise control over marriage, it falsely presupposes that we merely have the privilege, not the right, to marry. As an example of a right (as opposed to a privilege), those that are born in the US receive a birth certificate (certifying that they &quot;have been&quot; born), not a birth license (which would give them license so they &quot;could be&quot; born). Some Christian groups also argue that a marriage is a contract between a man and a woman presided over by God, so no authorization from the state is required. Some US states have started citing the state specifically as a party in the marriage contract which is seen by some as an infringement.

Marriage licenses have also been the subject of controversy for affected minority groups. California&#x27;s Proposition 8 has been the subject of heavy criticism by advocates of same-sex marriage, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community whose ability to marry is often limited by the aforementioned state intervention. This changed on June 26, 2015, with the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. However, the state and federal intervention still continues to limit the ability of members of other minority religious groups from marrying according to the dictates of their religious tenets, as is the case with Islamic polygamy, for example. Polyamorous and polyandrous marriages are, likewise, still prohibited.
In October 2009, Keith Bardwell, a Louisiana justice of the peace, refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple, prompting civil liberties groups, such as the NAACP and ACLU, to call for his resignation or firing. Bardwell resigned his office on November 3.

In the state of Pennsylvania, self-uniting marriage licenses are available which require only the signatures of the bride and groom and witnesses. Although this is an accommodation for a Quaker wedding, any couple is able to apply for it.

== The Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, couples intending to marry are required to register their intention beforehand, a process called &quot;ondertrouw&quot;.

== Mexico ==
In Mexico, only civil marriage is recognized as legal. Persons wishing to do so may also have a religious ceremony, but it has no legal effect and does not replace in any way the legal binding civil marriage. A civil wedding in Mexico is fully valid for legal purpose in the U.S. The Mexican civil registry issues marriage certificates rather than marriage licenses because under Roman law, marriage is a legal right, which does not require a permit. Marriages are performed without charge at the premises of the &quot;Registro Civil&quot; at the municipal hall of most counties and state houses in Mexico.
