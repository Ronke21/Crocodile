<text>Empathogens or entactogens are a class of psychoactive drugs that induce the production of experiences of emotional communion, oneness, relatedness, emotional openness—that is, empathy or sympathy—as particularly observed and reported for experiences with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). This class of drug is distinguished from the classes of hallucinogen or psychedelic, and amphetamine or stimulants. Major members of this class include MDMA, MDA, MDEA, MDOH, MBDB, 5-APB, 5-MAPB, 6-APB, 6-MAPB, methylone, mephedrone, GHB, αMT, and αET, MDAI among others. Most entactogens are phenethylamines and amphetamines, although several, such as αMT and αET, are tryptamines. When referring to MDMA and its counterparts, the term &quot;MDxx&quot; is often used (with the exception of MDPV). Entactogens are sometimes incorrectly referred to as hallucinogens or stimulants, although many entactogens such as ecstasy exhibit psychedelic or stimulant properties as well.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;empathogen&quot;, meaning &quot;generating a state of empathy&quot;, was coined in 1983–84 by Ralph Metzner as a term to denote a therapeutic class of drugs that includes MDMA and phenethylamine relatives. David E. Nichols in 1986 rejected this initial terminology and adopted, instead, the term &quot;entactogen&quot;, meaning &quot;producing a touching within&quot;, to denote this class of drugs, asserting a concern with the potential for improper association of the term &quot;empathogen&quot; with negative connotations related to the Greek root πάθος &quot;páthos&quot; (&quot;suffering; passion&quot;). Additionally, Nichols wanted to avoid any association with the term pathogenesis.
Nichols also thought the original term was limiting, and did not cover other therapeutic uses for the drugs that go beyond instilling feelings of empathy. The hybrid word &quot;entactogen&quot; is derived from the roots &quot;en&quot; (), &quot;tactus&quot; () and &quot;-gen&quot; (). Entactogen is not becoming dominant in usage, and, despite their difference in connotation, they are essentially interchangeable, as they refer to precisely the same chemicals.

In 2024, an additional alternative term, &quot;connectogen&quot;, was proposed and introduced.

==Psychological effects==
Both terms adopted and used in naming the class of therapeutic drugs for MDMA and related compounds were chosen with the intention of providing some reflection of the reported psychological effects associated with drugs in the classification and distinguishing these compounds from classical psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin and major stimulants, such as methamphetamine and amphetamine. Chemically, MDMA is classified as a substituted amphetamine (which includes stimulants like dextroamphetamine and psychedelics like 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), which makes MDMA a substituted phenethylamine (which includes other stimulants like methylphenidate and other psychedelics like mescaline) by the definition of amphetamine. While chemically related both to psychedelics and stimulants, the psychological effects experienced with MDMA were reported to provide obvious and striking aspects of personal relatedness, feelings of connectedness, communion with others, and ability to feel what others feel—in short an empathic resonance is consistently evoked. While psychedelics like LSD may sometimes yield effects of empathic resonance, these effects tend to be momentary and likely passed over on the way to some other dimension or interest. In contrast, the main characteristic that distinguishes MDMA from LSD-type experiences is the consistency of the effects of emotional communion, relatedness, emotional openness—in short, empathy and sympathy.

==Mechanism of action==
Entactogens like MDMA are serotonin releasing agents and hence are indirect agonists of serotonin receptors. They produce entactogenic effects in animals such as increased prosocial behavior like adjacent lying, enhanced empathy-like behavior, and antiaggressive effects. Likewise, MDMA increases sociability, prosociality, and emotional empathy in humans.

In animals, MDMA induced prosocial behavior and elevations in circulating oxytocin levels and these effects were abolished by pretreatment with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635. Conversely, the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT produced prosocial behavior and increased oxytocin levels similarly to MDMA. In addition, MDMA has been shown to activate oxytocinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and this too is reversed by serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonism. Subsequent research found that direct injection of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor WAY-100635 locally into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) suppressed MDMA-induced prosocial behavior and that direct injection of MDMA locally into the BLA significantly increased sociability.

The serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-206553 has also been found to block MDMA-induced prosocial behavior, although it produced potentially confounding thigmotaxis (hyperactivity at periphery of testing chamber) as well. Conversely, the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor antagonist GR-55562 and the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin were both ineffective. Likewise, another study found that selective antagonists of the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT4 receptors (SB-216641), volinanserin (MDL-100907), SB-242084, and SB-204070, respectively) were all ineffective in suppressing MDMA-induced prosocial activity. Other research has found that serotonin 5-HT2B receptor inactivation abolishes the serotonin release induced by MDMA and attenuates many of its effects. In addition to the preceding findings, induction of serotonin release by MDMA in the nucleus accumbens and consequent activation of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors in this area is implicated in its enhancement of prosocial behaviors, whereas consequent activation of yet-to-be-determined serotonin receptors in this area is implicated in its enhancement of empathy-like behaviors. Injection of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor antagonist NAS-181 directly into the nucleus accumbens blocked the prosocial behaviors of MDMA.

On the basis of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor-mediated oxytocin release with MDMA, it has been proposed that increased oxytocinergic signaling may mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Accordingly, intracerebroventricular injection of the peptide oxytocin receptor antagonist tocinoic acid blocked MDMA- and 8-OH-DPAT-induced prosocial effects. However, in a subsequent study, systemically administered C25, a non-peptide oxytocin receptor antagonist, failed to affect MDMA-induced prosocial behavior, whereas the vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist relcovaptan (SR-49059) was able to block MDMA-induced prosocial activity. It might be that tocinoic acid is non-selective and also blocks the vasopressin V1A receptor or that C25 is peripherally selective and is unable to block oxytocin receptors in the brain. More research is needed to clarify this. In any case, in another study, the non-peptide and centrally active selective oxytocin receptor antagonist L-368899 abolished MDMA-induced prosocial behavior. Conversely, in other studies, different oxytocin receptor antagonists were ineffective.

As in animals, MDMA greatly increases circulating oxytocin levels in humans. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors reduced the subjective effects of MDMA in humans, for instance increased extroversion, self-confidence, closeness, openness, and talkativeness. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin reduced MDMA-induced increases in friendliness. MDMA-induced emotional empathy was not affected by the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist pindolol or by intranasal oxytocin. Similarly, MDMA-induced emotional empathy and prosocial behavior have not been associated with circulating oxytocin levels. As such, the role of oxytocin in the entactogenic effects of MDMA in humans is controversial.

Other serotonin releasing agents, like fenfluramine, show prosocial effects in animals similar to those of MDMA. Fenfluramine has likewise been reported to improve social deficits in children with autism. Selective agonists of the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors and of the oxytocin receptors have been or are being investigated for the potential treatment of social deficits and aggression. Examples include batoprazine, eltoprazine (DU-28853), fluprazine (DU-27716), F-15,599 (NLX-01), zolmitriptan (ML-004), and LIT-001. Serotonergic psychedelics, for instance lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, which act as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists including of the serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors, have shown prosocial and empathy-enhancing effects in animals and/or humans as well, both acutely and long-term.

The serotonin release of MDMA appears to be the key pharmacological action mediating the entactogenic, prosocial, and empathy-enhancing effects of the drug. However, in addition to serotonin release, MDMA is also a potent releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, and hence acts as a well-balanced serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. Additionally, MDMA is a direct agonist of several serotonin receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, with moderate affinity. These actions are thought to play an important role in the effects of MDMA, including in its psychostimulant, euphoriant, and mild psychedelic effects, as well as in its unique and difficult-to-replicate &quot;magic&quot;. It has been said by Matthew Baggott that few to no MDMA analogues, including MBDB, methylone, 6-APDB, 5-APDB, 6-APB, 5-APB, MDAT, and MDAI among others, reproduce the full quality and &quot;magic&quot; of MDMA. Exceptions may anecdotally include 5-MAPB, particularly in specific enantiomer ratios, and the Borax combo. The unique properties of MDMA are believed to be dependent on a very specific mixture and ratio of pharmacological activities, including combined serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine release and direct serotonin receptor agonism.

==Therapeutic uses==
Psychiatrists began using entactogens as psychotherapy tools in the 1970s despite the lack of clinical trials. In recent years, the scientific community has been revisiting the possible therapeutic uses of entactogens. Therapeutic models using MDMA have been studied because of its entactogenic properties. This type of therapy would be applicable for treating a patient who was experiencing psychological trauma such as PTSD. Traumatic memories can be linked to fear in the patients which makes engaging with these memories difficult. Administration of an entactogen such as MDMA allows the patient to disconnect from the fear associated with the traumatic memories and engage in therapy. MDMA acts by targeting the body&#x27;s stress response in order to cause this therapeutic effect. In addition to reducing anxiety and a conditioned fear response, MDMA also reduces the avoidance of feelings. Patients are then able to trust themselves and their therapist and engage with traumatic memories under the influence of MDMA.

Although the therapeutic effects of entactogens may be promising, drugs such as MDMA have the potential for negative effects that are counter productive in a therapy setting. For example, MDMA may make negative cognition worse. This means that a positive experience is not a guarantee and can be contingent on aspects like the setting and the patient&#x27;s expectations. Additionally there is no clear model of the psychopharmacological means for a positive or negative experience. There is also a potential concern for the neurotoxic effects of MDMA on the fiber density of serotonin neurons in the neocortex. High doses of MDMA may cause potential depletion of serotonergic axons. The same effects may not be caused by lower doses of MDMA required for treatment, however.

<text>The Primulaceae ( ), commonly known as the primrose family (but not related to the evening primrose family), are a family of herbaceous and woody flowering plants including some favourite garden plants and wildflowers. Most are perennial though some species, such as scarlet pimpernel, are annuals.

Previously one of three families in the order Primulales, it underwent considerable generic re-alignment once molecular phylogenetic methods were used for taxonomic classification. The order was then submerged in a much enlarged order Ericales and became a greatly enlarged Primulaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; (&quot;s.l&quot;). In this new classification of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, each of the Primulales families was reduced to the rank of subfamily of Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; The original Primulaceae (Primulaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; or &quot;s.s.&quot;) then became subfamily Primuloideae, and one genus (&quot;Maesa&quot;) was raised to the rank of a separate subfamily, making four in all.
== Description ==
The family shares a number of characteristics, including haplostemonous flowers having the same number of petals and stamens, sympetalous corolla having the petals united, stamens opposite the petals, free central placentation, bitegmic (two layered) ovules and nuclear endosperm formation.

=== Stems ===
Primulaceae are mostly herbaceous, having no woody stem, except that some form cushions (spreading mats a few inches high) and their stems are stiffened by lignin. The stems can grow upright (&quot;erect&quot;) or spread out horizontally and then turn upright (&quot;decumbent&quot;).

=== Leaves ===
Leaves are &quot;simple&quot;, being directly attached to the stem by a petiole (stalk), but unlike the leaves of most flowering plants they have no stipules. The petiole is short or the leaf tapers gradually towards the base. Leaf arrangement is typically alternate but some are opposite or whorled, and there is generally a rosette at the base of the stem. The edges are toothed (&quot;dentate&quot;) or sawtoothed. New leaves in the bud are usually &quot;involute&quot; (rolled towards the upper surface) or &quot;conduplicate&quot; (folded upwards), but a few species roll downwards.

=== Flowers ===
Each flower is bisexual, having both stamens and carpels. They have radial symmetry; the petals can be separate or partially or fully fused together to form a tube-shaped corolla that opens up at the mouth to form a bell-like shape (as in item 8 in the figure) or a flat-faced flower. In most of the families of Ericales, stamens alternate with lobes, but in Primulaceae there is a stamen opposite each petal.

The calyx has 4 to 9 lobes and persists after flowering. They are grouped in unbranched, indeterminate clusters such as racemes, spikes, corymbs or umbels.

=== Reproductive anatomy ===
The fruit of Primulaceae begins as an ovary and inside it are the future seeds (ovules). These are attached to a central axis without any partitions between them (an arrangement called &quot;free central placentation&quot;; see item 7 in the figure), and they are &quot;bitegmic&quot; (having a double protective layer around each ovule). Unlike in most other families of Ericales, both layers form the opening at the top (the &quot;micropyle&quot;).

=== Seeds and fruit ===
As seeds develop, an endosperm grows around the embryo through free division of nuclei without forming walls (&quot;nuclear endosperm formation&quot;). The embryo forms a pair of short, narrow cotyledons (item 10 in the figure). Usually multiple seeds are in a capsule that is carried on a straight stalk (pedicel or scape). After it matures, it splits apart, releasing the seeds ballistically.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===

The taxonomic history of Primulaceae has been long and complex. The botanical authority for the family name is given to August Batsch (1794), as Batsch ex Borkh, using the term Primulae with six genera, the valid description being subsequently given by Borkhausen (1797). Some earlier authors attributed the name to Ventenat (1799), as Primulaceae Vent., who described the Primulacées, but Batsch had precedence.

Linnaeus (1753) placed &quot;Primula&quot; and related primuloid genera in the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens one pistil) in his sexual classification based on reproductive characteristics. Jussieu arranged Linnaeus&#x27; genera in a hierarchical system of ranks based on the relative value of a much wider range of characteristics. In his &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; (1789) he organised the primuloid genera into two &quot;Ordo&quot; (families), within a class (VIII) he called &quot;Dicotyledones Monopetalae Corolla Hypogyna&quot;, based on the cotyledons (two), form of the petals (fused), and position of the corolla with respect to the ovary (below). Jussieu&#x27;s families were the Lysimachiae, including &quot;Primula&quot; and &quot;Theophrasta&quot; and the Sapotae, including &quot;Myrsine&quot;, these being the three main lineages in modern understanding.

The most complete treatment of the Primulaceae family, with nearly 1,000 species arranged into 22 genera, was by Pax and Knuth in 1905 in the Engler system. They divided the family into five tribes (and several subtribes); Androsaceae, Cyclamineae, Lysimachieae, Samoleae and Corideae. Many systems since have lacked consistency, but generally recognised two major groups as either tribes or subfamilies, the Lysimachieae and Primuleae (the Androsaceae of Pax and Knuth), with the largest genera being &quot;Primula&quot;, &quot;Lysimachia&quot; and &quot;Androsace&quot;.
In the Cronquist system (1988), Cronquist included the three closely related families, Primulaceae, Myrsinaceae and Theophrastaceae in the order Primulales, of subclass Dilleniidae, based on morphological characteristics, in particular, ovaries with free-central placentation, a feature considered synapomorphic. His circumscription of Primulaceae included about 800 species.

==== Molecular phylogenetics ====

These three families were referred to as the primuloid families. With the later development of molecular phylogenetic methods, the Primulales were found to be more closely related to other families within the Ericales, and the three primuloid families were subsequently absorbed into an expanded Ericales (Ericales sensu lato or &quot;s.l.&quot;), making 24 families within that order, where the primuloids formed a monophyletic clade. It was also apparent that Myrsinaceae were paraphyletic, unless the genus &quot;Maesa&quot; was segregated and elevated to become a new monogeneric family, Maesaceae, but also that Primulaceae were probably paraphyletic.

In the first consensus taxonomic classification, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG 1998), these proposals were recognised by including Primulaceae within Ericales, as Eudicots, forming one of three clades in the Asterids (Asteridae). Maesa was formally segregated in 2000. Further changes came from analysis of DNA sequence data. This led to the move of genera (primarily terrestrial non-basal-rosette) from Primulaceae to Mysinaceae and Theophrastaceae. At that time Primulaceae was considered to consist of nine tribes (Primuleae, Androsaceae, Ardisiandreae, Lysimachieae, Glauceae, Anagallideae, Corideae, Cyclamineae, and Samoleae). Notably, Lysimachieae and three smaller tribes, Corideae, Cyclamineae and Ardisiandreae, were transferred to Myrsinaceae, and Samoleae to Theophrastaceae. This enlarged Myrsinaceae is distinguished as Myrsinaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; in comparison to the previous smaller family, Myrsinaceae &quot;s.s.&quot; (less &quot;Maesa&quot;). Some authors preferred to raise Samoleae to its own family, Samolaceae, but this has not been accepted by subsequent authors, placing it within Theophrastaceae, while recognising its distinct position within that grouping. These transfers, to preserve monophyly at the family level essentially left two tribes remaining in Primulaceae, the Primuleae and Androsaceae, with about 15 genera sharing a number of common characteristics. These additional changes were reflected in the 2003 revision of the APG system (APG II), where the now four primuloid families were among 23 in Ericales. This restricted Primulaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;s.s.&quot;) consisted of three groups: The Primulae, including &quot;Primula&quot;, the largest genus; the Androsaceae, including &quot;Androsace&quot;, the second largest genus; together with a small third group containing &quot;Soldanella,&quot; &quot;Hottonia&quot;, &quot;Omphalogramma&quot; and &quot;Bryocarpum&quot;.

The APG third classification system (APG III, 2009) discussed all the taxonomic challenges arising from the phylogenetic studies, and placed all primuloid genera into one large Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;, corresponding to Cronquist&#x27;s Primulales. They stated that &quot;The biggest problem for APG III was the question of how to treat Primulaceae and their immediate relatives, a closely related group that in the past has often been recognized as a separate order&quot;. The decision to treat all genera as a single family was based on the observation that the new circumscriptions had little in the way of apomorphies, but the entire group had numerous synapomorphies and were easy to recognise. This resulted in an Ericales with 22 families. Consequently, the four primuloid families were reduced to the rank of subfamilies within Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot;

=== Phylogeny ===
Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; APG III form part of the speciose (species rich) Asterid order Ericales &quot;s.l.&quot;, with about 12,000 species and 22 families as per APG IV. Ericales is one of four major clades within the asterids, where it is sister to the euasterids. The phylogenetic structure of Ericales, as shown in the following cladogram, consists of seven major suprafamilial clades (e.g. balsaminoids, styracoids) and a group of &quot;core&quot; Ericales. Within the eracalean families, Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; is shown as a sister group to Ebenaceae, and both are sister to Sapotaceae. These three families make up the primuloid clade.
==== Evolution and biogeography ====

The fossil record of Primulaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; is sparse, but the crown group has been estimated as c. 46-61 million years old. The crown primuloids have been dated to c. 102 mya, with Primulaceae/Ebenaceae divergence at 80 mya. Crown ages for the Primulaceae subfamilies vary from 24 mya for the Maesoideae, the basal group, to 70 mya for the Theophrastoideae.

The primuloids probably originated in a shared Neotropical/Indo-Malaysian ancestral range, with the Primulaceae/Ebenaceae clade occupying the neotropics. Theophrastoideae is nearly all neotropical with a more recent migration out of the realm found in the aquatic &quot;Samolus&quot; genus. The divergence between Theophrastoideae and Primuloideae-Myrsinoideae at 70 mya represents a vicariant event between the Neotropics and the Palearctic in the case of the latter. The Primuloideae originating in the Palearctic, persisted till the last 16 mya, when it started to shift into the Nearctic.

=== Subdivision ===
The three former families of the Primulales, together with the segregated Maesaceae, have been re-circumscribed into the broadly defined Primulaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; (&quot;s.l.&quot;) The two uniting features of this family are a free central placenta and one stamen opposite each of the corolla lobes. The cladogram below shows the infrafamilial phylogenetic relationships, together with the subfamilial crown ages. Maesoideae forms the basal group, while Primuloideae and
Myrsinoideae are in a sister group relationship.

Christenhusz et al. (2016, 2017) list 53 genera and 2,790 species, varying from 1 in Maesoideae to 38 in Myrsinoideae, with 8 in Theophrastoideae and the remaining 6 in Primuloideae. Byng (2014) and Plants of the World Online list 55 accepted genera. The generic limits of Myrsinoideae are not fully resolved and the status of a number of genera is under revision.

==== Subfamilies ====
=== Etymology ===
The Primulaceae are named for their nominative and type genus, &quot;&quot;. Linnaeus used this name to reflect its place among the first flowers of spring, given the primrose&#x27;s vernacular Latin name of &quot;primula veris&quot; (), &quot;primula&quot; (feminine diminutive &quot;primus&quot;, first + &quot;veris&quot; (genitive &quot;ver&quot;, spring).

<text>Baron Hawke, &quot;of Towton&quot; in the County of York, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created on 20 May 1776 for Admiral Sir Edward Hawke (of Scarthingwell Hall in the parish of Towton), responsible for a blockade of all French merchant shipping and the grounding of six French ships, and scattering of the rest, at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. The battle followed an earlier British victory at the Battle of Lagos off the coast of Portugal by a fleet under another admiral&#x27;s command.

The year, 1759, was dubbed for Britain its Annus Mirabilis, or &#x27;miracle year&#x27;, as France could not follow up on clear victory in the Battle of Sainte-Foy just before the Siege of Quebec for want of reinforcements and supplies from France, and its crippled trade triggered a credit crunch. Hawke&#x27;s naval conduct then and later as Lord Admiral proved to establish British naval supremacy and in the immediate term determined the fate of New France and hence Canada.

His son, the second Baron, represented Saltash in the House of Commons for the six years until his father died. His son, the third Baron, assumed the additional surname of Harvey. The fifth Baron succeeded his elder brother in 1869 and in the next year was succeeded by his first cousin, the sixth Baron. He was the son of Martin Bladen Edward Hawke (Jnr). His son, the seventh Baron, an exceptional cricketer, became the England cricket team captain. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the eighth Baron. His elder son, the ninth Baron, was one of six to eight co-serving Lords whips in the third Churchill ministry and two following Conservative ministries until 1964. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Baron, whose son then became the 11th Baron on his death. , the title is held by the 12th Baron, who succeeded his father in 2009.

The family seat is The Old Mill House, near Cuddington, Cheshire.

<text>The World Hockey Association 2 was a minor professional ice hockey league created at the instigation of the organizers of the proposed recreated World Hockey Association to serve as its development league. The WHA2 teams — some of which had played the 2002–03 season in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League — were all in the southeastern United States. David Waronker was the league&#x27;s founder and also served as the league&#x27;s commissioner.

The WHA2 operated in the 2003–04 season only, after which (due to a falling-out with the parent organization) it was served a cease-and-desist from the WHA and ceased operations. David Waronker was credited with both the founding and collapse of the league. In addition he owned or co-owned all of the teams in the league. Its surviving teams merged with survivors of the South East Hockey League to form the Southern Professional Hockey League for the 2004–2005 season.

The Jacksonville Barracudas won the WHA2&#x27;s first and only President&#x27;s Cup. Jacksonville also hosted the first and only WHA2 All-Star Game.

==Teams==
* Orlando Seals (became the Florida Seals for the 2005–06 SPHL season)
* Jacksonville Barracudas (moved to SPHL for 2004–05)
* Macon Trax (moved to SPHL for 2004–05)

<doc id="473055" wikidata="Q157513" url="?curid=473055" title="Lythrum salicaria">
<text>Lythrum salicaria or purple loosestrife is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lythraceae. It should not be confused with other plants sharing the name loosestrife that are members of the family Primulaceae. Other names include spiked loosestrife and purple Lythrum. This herbaceous perennial is native to Europe and Asia, and possibly Australia.

==Etymology and other names==
The generic name &quot;Lythrum&quot; is derived from the Greek &#x27;lythron&#x27;, meaning blood, in reference to the flower colour in some species. However, Pliny (A.D. 23–79) stated that &quot;Lythrum&quot; is named for Lysimachus, an army general and friend of Alexander the Great. &quot;Lysimachus&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;lysis&quot;, meaning &quot;loosing&quot; and &quot;mache&quot;, meaning &quot;strife&quot;. 

The specific epithet &quot;salicaria&quot; derives from the similarity of the leaves to those of willows or &quot;Salix&quot; species.

The English word loosestrife first appeared in written form in the 16th century. It was coined by English naturalist William Turner in his 1548 work &quot;A New Herball&quot;, in which he states: &quot;[The plant] may in englishe be called red loosestryfe or purple loosestryfe.&quot;

Purple loosestrife was referred to several times as &#x27;long purples&#x27; by John Clare, such as in his 1821 poem &quot;The Wildflower Nosegay&quot;:

==Description==
&quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot; can grow tall, forming clonal colonies or more in width, with numerous erect stems growing from a single woody root mass. The stems are reddish-purple and square in cross-section. The leaves are lanceolate, long and broad, downy and sessile, and arranged opposite or in whorls of three.

The flowers are reddish purple, in diameter, with six petals (occasionally five) and 12 stamens, and are clustered tightly in the axils of bracts or leaves, (a type of inflorescence called a verticilaster), there are three different flower types, with the stamens and style of different lengths, short, medium or long; each flower type can only be pollinated by one of the other types, not the same type, thus ensuring cross-pollination between different plants. For instance, if the pistil is medium length, then the stamens will be long and short, but not medium. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome.

The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous minute seeds. Flowering lasts throughout the summer. When the seeds are mature, the leaves often turn bright red through dehydration in early autumn; the red colour may last for almost two weeks. The dead stalks from previous growing seasons are brown.
&quot;L. salicaria&quot; is very variable in leaf shape and degree of hairiness, and a number of subspecies and varieties have been described, but it is now generally regarded as monotypic with none of these variants being considered of botanical significance. The species &quot;Lythrum intermedium&quot; is also now considered synonymous.

==Distribution==

&quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot; is native to Europe, temperate Asia and northwest Africa. It is also naturalized in many temperate parts of the world, including parts of southern Africa, North America, and South America. The species was thought to be a recent introduction to Australia, but pre-colonial pollen samples have been found in New South Wales, indicating another route of introduction; the question is considered unresolved by Australian authorities.

==Ecology==
Found in ditches, wet meadows and marshes and along sides of lakes. In North America, purple loosestrife can invade sedge meadows.

==Associated insects==

The flowers are pollinated by long-tongued insects, including bees and butterflies.

A number of insects use &quot;Lythrum salicaria&quot; as a food resource.

The black-margined loosestrife beetle &quot;Galerucella calmariensis&quot; is a brown beetle with a black line on its thorax. The adult feeds on the leaves of the plant, producing characteristic round holes. Its larvae destroy tender leaf buds and strip the tissue from the leaves. The golden loosestrife beetle &quot;Galerucella pusilla&quot; is nearly identical to &quot;G. calmariensis&quot;, but usually lacks the black thoracic line. Its feeding habits are also quite similar to the other leaf beetle.

The loosestrife root weevil &quot;Hylobius transversovittatus&quot; is a large red nocturnal weevil, which spends its nights feeding on leaves and leaf buds. The larvae emerge from their eggs and immediately burrow into the root of the plant, which they feed on continuously for over a year. This root damage stunts the plant&#x27;s growth and ability to create seeds. If several larvae inhabit the same root, the plant can be killed.

The loosestrife flower weevil &quot;Nanophyes marmoratus&quot; is a tiny weevil which lays a single egg in each flower. When the larvae emerge they eat the flowers&#x27; ovaries, and the plant is unable to create seeds. The larvae usually proceed to hollow out the flower buds and use them as safe places to pupate.

Caterpillars of the engrailed moth (&quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;), a polyphagous geometer moth, also feed on purple loosestrife.

==Cultivation, uses and impact==
It has been used as an astringent medicinal herb to treat diarrhea and dysentery; it is considered safe to use for all ages, including babies. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens, and is particularly associated with damp, poorly drained locations such as marshes, bogs and watersides. However, it will tolerate drier conditions. The flowers are showy and bright, and a number of cultivars have been selected for variation in flower colour, including:
* &#x27;Atropurpureum&#x27; with dark purple flowers
* &#x27;Brightness&#x27; with deep pink flowers
* &#x27;Happy&#x27; with red flowers on a short () stem
* &#x27;Purple Spires&#x27; with purple flowers on a tall stem
* &#x27;Roseum Superbum&#x27; with large pink flowers.

The cultivars ‘Blush’ with blush-pink flowers, and &#x27;Feuerkerze&#x27; with rose-red flowers have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

It has also been introduced in many areas of North America by bee keepers, due to its abundance of flowers which provide an important source of nectar.

===As an invasive species===

Purple loosestrife has been introduced into temperate New Zealand and North America where it is now widely naturalised (spreading on its own) and officially listed in some controlling agents. Infestations may rarely result in dramatic disruption in water flow in rivers and canals, and the life cycles of organisms from waterfowl to amphibians to algae being affected.

A single plant may produce up to 2.7 million tiny seeds annually. Easily carried by wind and water, the seeds germinate in moist soils after overwintering. The plant can also sprout anew from pieces of root left in the soil or water. Once established, loosestrife stands are difficult and costly to remove by mechanical and chemical means.

However, research about how invasive plants are portrayed in media indicate that the threat from loosestrife and other infamous invasive plants is driven more by media attention than science. While the species does have negative impacts on the natural environment the scientific literature supports a much more modest assessment of how bad it is outside its native range and that resources would be better spent on preventing disturbance of wetlands than on the removal of purple loosestrife.

Plants marketed under the name &quot;European wand loosestrife&quot; (&quot;L. virgatum&quot;) are the same species despite the different name. In some cases the plants sold are sterile, which is preferable.

In North America, purple loosestrife may be distinguished from similar native plants (e.g., fireweed &quot;Chamerion angustifolium&quot;, blue vervain &quot;Verbena hastata&quot;, Liatris &quot;Liatris&quot; spp., and spiraea (&quot;Spiraea douglasii&quot;) by its angular stalks which are square in outline, as well as by its leaves, which are in pairs that alternate at right angle and are not serrated.

====Biological control====
Purple loosestrife provides a model of successful biological pest control. Research began in 1985 and today the plant is managed well with a number of insects that feed on it. Five species of beetle use purple loosestrife as their natural food source, and they can do significant damage to the plant. The beetles used as biological control agents include two species of leaf beetle: &quot;Galerucella calmariensis&quot; and &quot;Galerucella pusilla&quot;; and three species of weevil: &quot;Hylobius transversovittatus&quot;, &quot;Nanophyes breves&quot;, and &quot;Nanophyes marmoratus&quot;. Infestations of either of the &quot;Galerucella&quot; species is extremely effective in wiping out a stand of purple loosestrife, defoliating up to 100% of the plants in an area. The moth &quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot; is polyphagous and a pest species itself, and unsuitable for biological control.

<text>Ford Aerospace was the aerospace and defense division of Ford Motor Company. It was based in Dearborn, Michigan and was active from 1956 (originally as Philco and then Philco Ford) through 1990, when it was sold to the Loral Corporation. Major divisions were located in Palo Alto CA (Space Systems Division), San Jose CA (Western Development Laboratories) and Newport Beach (Aeronutronic Division). Other operations were located in a number of other states around the United States.

==History==
The company was established in 1956. It was renamed to &quot;Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation&quot; in 1976, and then to &quot;Ford Aerospace Corporation&quot; in 1988.

The Engineering and Research Center campus was located on Jamboree Road at Ford Road, overlooking the Santa Catalina Strait of the Pacific Ocean in Newport Beach. The facility&#x27;s master plan and main buildings were designed by Modernist architect William Pereira in 1958. Operation was moved to Newport Beach in 1960.

In the 1960s and 1970s, business enjoyed rapid growth because of the success of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and Chaparral surface-to-air missile programs. In the 1970s, the Pave Tack bomb-targeting system became a significant contributor to revenue.

The company included: Space Systems Division (later Space Systems/Loral) and the Western Development Labs (WDL) (later Loral WDL, and presently Lockheed Martin WDL) in Palo Alto, California with Aeronutronic (later Space Systems/Loral) at the Newport Beach site.

<doc id="473058" wikidata="Q366166" url="?curid=473058" title="Johnny Torrio">
<text>John Donato Torrio (born Donato Torrio, ; January 20, 1882 – April 16, 1957) was an Italian-born mobster who helped build the Chicago Outfit in the 1920s later inherited by his protégé Al Capone. Torrio proposed a National Crime Syndicate in the 1930s and later became an adviser to Lucky Luciano and his Luciano crime family.

Torrio had several nicknames, primarily &quot;The Fox&quot; for his cunning and finesse. The US Treasury official Elmer Irey considered him &quot;the biggest gangster in America&quot; and wrote, &quot;He was the smartest and, I dare say, the best of all the hoodlums. &#x27;Best&#x27; referring to talent, not morals&quot;. Virgil W. Peterson of the Chicago Crime Commission stated that his &quot;talents as an organizational genius were widely respected by the major gang bosses in the New York City area&quot;. Crime journalist Herbert Asbury affirmed: &quot;As an organizer and administrator of underworld affairs, Johnny Torrio is unsurpassed in the annals of American crime; he was probably the nearest thing to a real mastermind that this country has yet produced&quot;.

==Early life==
Torrio was born in Irsina (then known as Montepeloso), Basilicata, in Southern Italy, to Tommaso Torrio and Maria Carluccio originally from Altamura, Apulia. When he was two his father, a railway employee, died in a work accident; shortly after, Torrio immigrated to James Street on the Lower East Side of New York City with his widowed mother in December 1884. She later remarried.

His first jobs were as a porter and bouncer in Manhattan. While he was a teenager, he joined a street gang together with another James Street resident Robert Vanella and became its leader; he eventually managed to save enough money and opened a billiards parlor for the group, and from there grew illegal activities such as gambling and loan sharking. Torrio&#x27;s business sense caught the eye of Paul Kelly, the leader of the Five Points Gang. Torrio&#x27;s gang ran legitimate businesses, but its primary concern was the numbers game, supplemented by incomes from bookmaking, loan sharking, hijacking, prostitution, and opium trafficking. Al Capone, who worked at Kelly&#x27;s club, admired Torrio&#x27;s quick mind and looked to him as his mentor.

Capone had belonged to the Junior Forty Thieves, the Bowery Boys and the Brooklyn Rippers; they soon moved up to the Five Points Gang. One of Torrio&#x27;s associates, Frankie Yale, eventually hired Capone to bartend at the Harvard Inn, a bar in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.

==Move to Chicago==
By 1909, Torrio moved to Chicago. &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo, who had become head of a burgeoning vice empire in Chicago is reputed to have invited him to the city to help him deal with Black Hand extortionists. After doing so, Torrio became a top lieutenant in Colosimo&#x27;s organization, rising to underboss by 1914.

In 1919, Al Capone arrived in Chicago and started working as a bouncer and bartender at one of the Colosimo gang establishments, the Four Deuces at 2222 S. Wabash Street.

==Colosimo murder==
When Prohibition went into effect in 1920, Torrio pushed for the gang to enter into bootlegging, but Colosimo stubbornly refused. In March 1920, Colosimo secured an uncontested divorce from Victoria Moresco. A month later, he and Dale Winter eloped to West Baden Springs, Indiana. Upon their return, he bought a home on the South Side. On May 11, 1920, Colosimo drove to Colosimo&#x27;s Cafe to meet an associate he had never met before. He was shot and killed a few minutes after entering the restaurant by a gunman hiding in the cloak room. A bullet entered Colosimo&#x27;s brain, behind his right ear. Contract killer Frankie Yale had allegedly traveled from New York to Chicago and personally killed longtime gang boss Colosimo at the behest of Torrio. Although suspected by Chicago police, Yale was never officially charged. Colosimo was allegedly murdered because he stood in the way of his gang making bootlegging profits, having &quot;gone soft&quot; after his marriage with Winter.

==Rivalry with North Side Gang==
Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. However, many other gangs were active in Chicago at this time, and Torrio was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. In 1920, Torrio built an agreement between most of Chicago&#x27;s bootlegging gangs into a city-wide cartel. The smaller North Side Gang led by Dean O&#x27;Banion was of mixed ethnicity and was a member of the bootlegging cartel. In 1924, the North Side Gang discovered that the Genna brothers, close to Torrio&#x27;s gang, were selling their booze in North Side Gang territory. O&#x27;Banion went to Torrio, who was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes. As a result, the North Side Gang responded by hijacking Genna beer shipments.

In May 1924, O&#x27;Banion learned that the police planned to raid the Sieben brewery on a particular night. Before the raid, O&#x27;Banion approached Torrio and told him he wanted to sell his share in the brewery, claiming that he wanted to leave the rackets and retire to Colorado. Torrio agreed to buy O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s share and gave him half a million dollars. On the morning of the deal, the police (including the police chief) raided and shut down the brewery. Torrio, O&#x27;Banion, and several others were arrested. Torrio was indicted on bootlegging charges, a repeat offense for him with mandatory jail time. Torrio realized he had been betrayed and conned out of $500,000 by O&#x27;Banion.

Torrio would have immediately attempted to retaliate against O&#x27;Banion and the North Side Gang had it not been for Mike Merlo, head of the Unione Siciliana labor organization. Merlo had a vested interest in keeping the peace between Chicago&#x27;s gangs, and he convinced Torrio to forestall any violence against the North Side Gang.

Mike Merlo died of cancer on November 8, 1924. On November 10, three men entered O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s Schofield&#x27;s Flowers shop under the pretense of buying flowers for Merlo&#x27;s funeral and shot O&#x27;Banion dead. The killers are reputed to have been Frankie Yale, John Scalise, and Albert Anselmi, acting on Torrio&#x27;s behalf.

O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s death placed Hymie Weiss at the head of the North Side Gang, backed by Vincent Drucci and Bugs Moran. Weiss had been a close friend of O&#x27;Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.

==Assassination attempt and handover to Capone==
In January 1925, Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, on January 24, Torrio and his wife Anna were ambushed outside their home by Weiss, Drucci, and Moran. Torrio was shot several times and nearly killed. After recovering, he effectively resigned, handed control of the gang to Capone, and fled to New York.

In late 1925, Torrio moved to Italy with his wife and mother, where he no longer dealt directly with the mob business. He gave total control of the Outfit to Capone and said, &quot;It&#x27;s all yours, Al. Me? I&#x27;m quitting. It&#x27;s Europe for me&quot;. Torrio left a criminal empire which grossed about $70,000,000 a year ($1,241,304,000 in 2024 dollars) from bootleg liquor, gambling and prostitution.

==Later years and death==
In 1928, Torrio returned to the United States, as Benito Mussolini began putting pressure on the Mafia in Italy. He is credited with helping to organize a loose cartel of East Coast bootleggers, the Big Seven, in which many prominent gangsters, including Lucky Luciano, Longy Zwillman, Joe Adonis, Frank Costello, and Meyer Lansky played a part. Torrio also supported the creation of a national body that would prevent all-out turf wars between gangs that had broken out in Chicago and New York. His idea was well received, and a conference was hosted in Atlantic City by Torrio, Lansky, Luciano and Costello in May 1929; the National Crime Syndicate was created.

Torrio was charged with income tax evasion in 1936 and, after several failed appeals, was sent to prison in 1939, serving two years. In 1940, a property that Torrio co-owned with Vanella, Jack Cusick, and Capone was sold at auction to satisfy Capone&#x27;s tax delinquencies. After his release, he lived quietly until his death.

On April 16, 1957, Torrio had a heart attack in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York while he was sitting in a barber&#x27;s chair waiting for a haircut; he died several hours later in a nearby hospital.

Located in Buffalo, New York, the team plays their home games at Sahlen Field, the highest-capacity Triple-A ballpark in the United States.

The current Bisons organization was founded in 1979 and assumed the history of previous franchises that also used the Buffalo Bisons name, most notably the 1886–1970 Buffalo Bisons minor league franchise, and the 1879–1885 Buffalo Bisons major league franchise. The team established the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985 to honor former players, managers and contributors to baseball in Buffalo.

The team holds the all-time record for single-season attendance in Minor League Baseball, selling 1,240,951 tickets in 1991 while being considered for 1993 Major League Baseball expansion. &quot;Forbes&quot; valued the Buffalo Bisons at $34 million in 2016, making it the 15th-most valuable Minor League Baseball franchise.

==History==

Mayor James D. Griffin and an investment group purchased the Jersey City A&#x27;s of the Double-A class Eastern League for $55,000 in 1978, and the team began play as the Buffalo Bisons at War Memorial Stadium in 1979. This new franchise assumed the history of prior Buffalo Bisons teams that had played in the city from 1877 to 1970. Robert E. Rich Jr. purchased the Bisons for $100,000 in 1983, and upgraded the team to the Triple-A class American Association in 1985 after buying out the Wichita Aeros for $1 million. Rich Jr. grew the team&#x27;s popularity and was known for his innovative promotional tie-ins, most notably an annual series of post-game concerts by The Beach Boys.

The Buffalo Bisons moved to the $42.4 million Pilot Field (now Sahlen Field) in downtown Buffalo in the 1988 season. In their first year at the venue after moving from War Memorial Stadium, the Bisons broke the all-time record for Minor League Baseball attendance by drawing 1,186,651 fans during the 1988 season. The team won two division titles and set subsequent attendance records on the heels of their unsuccessful 1993 Major League Baseball expansion bid. The team&#x27;s 1991 single-season attendance of 1,240,951 remains a Minor League Baseball record.

The Cleveland Indians replaced the Pittsburgh Pirates as Major League Baseball affiliate of the Buffalo Bisons prior to the 1995 season. The team won division titles in 1996 and 1997, and won the final American Association championship in 1997. Bartolo Colón threw the first no-hitter in franchise history on June 20, 1997 against the New Orleans Zephyrs.

In wake of the American Association disbanding following the 1997 season, the Bisons joined the International League in 1998. The team won the division and league championship in their first season, but lost the Triple-A World Series. The addition of regional rivalries allowed for the creation of the Thruway Cup, an annual competition between the Buffalo Bisons, Rochester Red Wings and Syracuse SkyChiefs. The Bisons went on to win division titles in 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, and the league championship at home in 2004.

The New York Mets replaced the Cleveland Indians as Major League Baseball affiliate of the Buffalo Bisons prior to the 2009 season. This era was plagued with poor on-field performance and low attendance.

The Toronto Blue Jays replaced the New York Mets as Major League Baseball affiliate of the Buffalo Bisons prior to the 2013 season. To kick off this era, the Bisons scored 27 runs on 29 hits against the Syracuse Chiefs on April 18, 2013, setting records for the most runs and hits in an International League game since 1973. The Blue Jays used Sahlen Field as their home field in 2020 after the Bisons season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, investing $5 million in upgrading the venue.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball and the closure of the International League, the Bisons joined the newly formed Triple-A East in 2021. Due to renovations at Sahlen Field as well as use of the stadium by the Blue Jays, the Bisons began their 2021 season at Trenton Thunder Ballpark in Trenton, New Jersey. At their home games, they wore the uniforms of the Trenton Thunder and were referred to as such, while on the road they were still known as the Buffalo Bisons.

With the reinstatement of the historical league names in 2022, the Bisons were returned to the International League.

<text>Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge (March 8, 1860 – November 10, 1932) was a businessman and promoter of patent fiberboard, and the first chairman of the interstate agency known then as the Port of New York Authority. The Outerbridge Crossing, a Port Authority bridge, was named for him.

==Biography==
Eugenius was born on March 8, 1860, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Bermudians Alexander Ewing Outerbridge I and Laura Catherine Harvey. His sister, Mary Ewing Outerbridge, was the founder, in 1874, of American lawn tennis which was the progenitor of modern tennis. His other siblings include Albert Albany Outerbridge, Sir Joseph Outerbridge (1843–1933), August Emelio Outerbridge (1846–1921), Harriett Harvey Outerbridge, Alexander Ewing Outerbridge II, Laura Catharine Outerbridge and Adolph John Harvey Outerbridge (1858–1928).

Outerbridge incorporated the Agasote Millboard Company in 1909 to produce a high-density fiberboard. The company used the material to produce roof panels for railroad cars and automobiles. In 1916, the company introduced Vehisote, a versatile fiberboard made from recycled materials, made by the company in West Trenton, New Jersey. Both the product and the company were later renamed as Homasote, and remain in active production .

Outerbridge was the first chairman of the Port of New York Authority, now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The new authority was founded on April 30, 1921, and was the first interstate agency created under a clause of the US Constitution permitting compacts between states.

Outerbridge was among the founding organizers of the Richmond County Country Club on Staten Island in 1888. He was a longtime member of the Union Club of the City of New York and, until his death, he was chairman of the Building Committee in charge of planning the 69th Street clubhouse.

He died on November 10, 1932, at 950 Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.

==Legacy==
The Outerbridge Crossing, a toll bridge between Staten Island, New York, and Perth Amboy, New Jersey, is named in his honor. It opened on June 29, 1928.

<text>Foreshadowing is a narrative device in which a storyteller gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, and it helps develop or subvert the audience&#x27;s expectations about upcoming events.

The writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways such as character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story so that the readers are interested and want to know more.

The literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next to add dramatic tension to a story. Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, and some events are predicted so that the audience feels that it anticipated them.

Hints may be about future events, character revelations, and plot twists to create mood, convey theme, and build suspense, usually to hint at the good events that will likely cross paths with or happen to the main character later on.

Plot can be delayed by situations or events to give the impression that something momentous will occur to build anticipation and emphasize importance to them, which gives the audience a series of questions, particularly after cliffhangers.

The literary device is frequently adapted for use by composers of theatrical music, in the composition of operas, musicals, radio, films, television, gaming, podcasts, and internet scores and underscores, and incidental music for spoken theatrical productions.

==Methods==

Foreshadowing can be accomplished by the use of story-driven or fictional events which can bring original dialogue, emotional investment in the plot, such as for the main character, unknown and present characters.

A flashback is the interruption of a sequential narrative plot to present important events that have happened in the past to present plot points that are difficult to bring into the narrative, such as character traits, events, or themes which may drive the current narrative or to be revealed.

Flashforwards move the plot forward in time where formerly revealed or new character traits, events or themes are brought into the story. They might embellish past or current plot points.

Chekhov&#x27;s gun, a principle where an object or character is shown numerous times, referring to that same object will be used that is important to the narrative. A red herring may also be played here.

==Related concepts==
Foreshadowing is often confused with other literary devices.

A red herring is a hint designed to mislead the audience. Foreshadowing only hints at a possible outcome within the confinement of a narrative and leads readers in the right direction. 

A flashforward is a scene that takes the narrative forward in time from the current point of the story in literature, film, television, or other media. Foreshadowing is sometimes employed through characters&#x27; explicitly predicting the future. Flashforwards have scenes shown out of chronological order in a nonlinear narrative, with chronology in an anachronist order, such as to make the reader or the audience think about the climax or reveals.

Chekhov&#x27;s gun dictates that everything superfluous must be deleted. In relation to foreshadowing, the literary critic Gary Morson describes its opposite, sideshadowing. Found notably in the epic novels of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, sideshadowing is the practice of including scenes that turn out to have no relevance to the plot. That, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. The &quot;sense of structurelessness&quot; invites the audience to &quot;interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass.&quot;

<text>Abrams Battle Tank is a video game developed by Dynamix and published by Electronic Arts in 1988 for MS-DOS. Designed by Damon Slye, the game is a 3D vehicle simulation of the M1 Abrams tank. The 1991 Sega Genesis port by Realtime Games Software was renamed to M-1 Abrams Battle Tank.

==Gameplay==
Although the simulation depicts the four crew positions, and is advertised as a simulation, gameplay is not actually very realistic; the missions are arcade game-like with a fixed sequence of actions to perform. The graphics were very good for their time, but reviews are mixed, with many players enjoying the &quot;fun factor&quot; introduced by the lack of realism, and others decrying it for the same reason.

==Ports==

The port from MS-DOS to Genesis was performed by Realtime Games Software in the UK using their own 3D engine that was earlier used in &quot;Carrier Command&quot; with some tweaks to adapt it to the Genesis and the needs of the tank scenario.

==Reception==
In 1989, &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the MS-DOS version of the game 3 out of 5 stars. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game two and a half stars out of five, stating that &quot;Abrams Battle Tank&quot; was a good game but a poor simulation. The magazine cited the commanding officer&#x27;s briefings, at one point threatening failure with execution, as unprofessional and offensive to military personnel. In a 1994 survey of wargames the magazine gave the title two out of five stars, stating that newer games had superseded it and criticizing the simulation of a single tank instead of a company or squad. &quot;Compute!&quot; agreed that the game was not very realistic, but advised players to &quot;accept the game as a graphically excellent, tactically complex simulation&quot;.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Abrams Battle Tank&quot; the 50th best computer game ever.

<text>Baron Brownlow, of Belton in the County of Lincoln, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1776 for Sir Brownlow Cust, 4th Baronet. The Cust family descends from Richard Cust (1622–1700) of The Black Friars, Stamford, who represented Lincolnshire and Stamford in Parliament. In 1677 he was created a baronet, &quot;of Stamford in the County of Lincoln&quot;. He was succeeded by his grandson Richard Cust, 2nd Baronet, who married Anne Brownlow, daughter of Sir William Brownlow, 4th Baronet, &quot;of Humby&quot;, Lincolnshire, and sister and sole heiress of John Brownlow, 1st Viscount Tyrconnel, 5th Baronet of Belton House, Lincolnshire.
The 2nd Baronet&#x27;s son Sir John Cust, 3rd Baronet, sat as a Member of Parliament for Grantham and served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1761 to 1770 and in 1754 inherited the Brownlow estates, including Belton, on the death of his childless maternal uncle Viscount Tyrconnel. His son Brownlow Cust, 4th Baronet, represented Ilchester, Somerset, and Grantham in Parliament and in 1776 was raised to the peerage as Baron Brownlow, &quot;of Belton in the County of Lincoln&quot;, chiefly in recognition of his father&#x27;s services. He was succeeded by his son John Cust, 2nd Baron Brownlow, who had sat as a Member of Parliament for Clitheroe, Lancashire, and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire for many years. In 1815 he was created Viscount Alford, &quot;in the County of Lincoln&quot;, and Earl Brownlow, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1810 the future 1st Earl had married Sophia Hume, a daughter of Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet, of Wormleybury, by his wife Lady Amelia Egerton, a great-granddaughter of John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater.

On his death in 1853, the titles passed to his grandson John Egerton-Cust, 2nd Earl Brownlow (the son of John Egerton, Viscount Alford), who in 1853, in accordance with the will of his kinsman John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater, assumed by royal licence the surname and arms of Egerton in lieu of Cust, but in 1863 by royal licence resumed the surname of Cust in addition to that of Egerton. The 2nd Earl, having managed to inherit the substantial Bridgewater estates after a remarkable lawsuit, died young and was succeeded in 1867 by his younger brother Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow, a Conservative politician who briefly represented Shropshire North in the House of Commons before inheriting the peerage. The 3rd Earl later served under Lord Salisbury as Paymaster General (1887–1889) and as Under-Secretary of State for War (1889–1892), and was also Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire for over fifty years. However, on his death the viscountcy and earldom became extinct.

He was succeeded in the barony and baronetcy in 1921 by his second cousin Adelbert Salusbury Cockayne-Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow, 8th Baronet, the youngest son of Henry Cockayne-Cust, eldest son of Reverend Henry Cust, younger son of the 1st Baron. His son
Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow, succeeded in 1927 and served as a Lord-in-waiting to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Beaverbrook (Minister of Aircraft Production), as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire and as Mayor of Grantham. In 1978 he was succeeded by his son Edward Cust, 7th Baron Brownlow, who died in 2021.

Several other members of the family may also be mentioned. Peregrine Cust and William Cust, younger sons of the first Baron, were both Members of Parliament. William&#x27;s son Arthur Purey-Cust was Dean of York. Edward Cust, another younger son of the first Baron, was a soldier and politician. He was created a Baronet in 1876 (see Cust baronets, of Leasowe Castle). Henry John &quot;Harry&quot; Cockayne-Cust (1861–1917), a brother of the fifth baron, was a politician and newspaper editor.

The family seat was Belton House, in the parish of Belton, near Grantham in Lincolnshire, which in 1984 was given by the 7th Baron to the National Trust.

<doc id="473073" wikidata="Q1326328" url="?curid=473073" title="The Irresponsible Captain Tylor">
<text>is an anime series based on light novel series by Hitoshi Yoshioka, taking the title from its first volume. It was produced by some of Japan&#x27;s larger studios, including Big West, Tatsunoko Production, King Records and VAP.

&quot;Tylor&quot; consists of a 26-episodes TV series directed by Kōichi Mashimo, and a sequel OVA series of 10 episodes directed by Mashimo and Naoyuki Yoshinaga. The TV show premiered in Japan on TV Tokyo between January 25, 1993 and July 19, 1993, and was broadcast across Latin America by the television network Magic Kids. Both series were broadcast across the United States by AZN Television. &quot;Tylor&quot; is distributed across North America by The Right Stuf International.

Enterbrain published a 3-volume sequel manga miniseries in 2001 and 2002. The light novels and manga haven&#x27;t been translated.

A short anime series, titled and produced by Seven, aired from July 11 to September 26, 2017.

==Plot==
In a distant, highly technological future, Tylor, the title character, is a mysterious young man without a real purpose in life, a state of mind that is very hard to determine, and a knack for accidentally getting out of near-death situations with a childishly cavalier attitude. He sometimes does not even seem to realize when he is in danger, which is actually an asset to him on many occasions.

Tylor stumbles his way into the United Planets Space Force and soon gains command of a destroyer after resolving a hostage dispute and saving a retired admiral. Despite being given a decrepit and underpowered ship (the Soyokaze), thanks to brilliant strokes of luck, Tylor manages to destroy a patrol group. This is quickly followed by a sneak attack on another patrol group, performed while Tylor was playing the role of a consummate, professional soldier. The admiralty, attempting to kill Tylor, present him with a medal modified with a device to trick the Raalgon fleet into believing the Soyokaze is an entire fleet. Tylor loses the medal in UPSF HQ, and the Raalgons destroy the admiralty&#x27;s super-weapon instead.

The Soyokaze is then sent to a demotion sector, despite the fervent hopes of its crew. There, Tylor and Yamamoto encounter the ghost of the former captain, who vanishes due to depression after seeing Tylor&#x27;s behavior. The Admiral of the fleet, who actually drove the prior Captain to suicide, rescinds Tylor&#x27;s demotion after seeing Tylor with the former captain&#x27;s pipe, thinking he is now aware of the admiral&#x27;s crime. Tylor is then captured by the Raalgon fleet, who plan to execute him to boost morale. After escaping his cell, Tylor encounters the Empress of the Raalgon, Azalyn, in plain dress, and spends the day entertaining her. She stops his execution, and his jailors implant microchip in his brain to control him.

Meanwhile, the crew of the Soyokaze has been imprisoned by the brass. They manage to escape captivity and invade the Melva, the main Raalgon ship, to get Tylor back. During the fight, Tylor saves Azalyn from a bomb that her treacherous Prime Minister Wang had detonated to gain power for himself. Tylor is badly injured, and Azalyn tells the Raalgon that she is going with Tylor back to the Soyokaze in order to make sure he is all right. After the doctor saves Tylor, Azalyn returns to her people.

Tylor then rendezvouses with the main fleet, where he is branded a traitor for letting Azalyn return. He is sentenced to death by a firing squad. However, Tylor convinces the brass that he can defeat the Raalgon, and they reluctantly allow him to take complete command. After coming to a stand-off with Dom, Tylor manages to spill no blood and stop the fighting for the time being. After the death of Admiral Hanner, whom Tylor had adored and talked with, Tylor becomes sullen and announces he will leave the military. Lieutenant Yamamoto is given command of the brand new ship, the Aso. In the final episode, the former crew of the Soyokaze, who are supposed to be on the Aso, join Tylor on the Soyokaze as they fly out into space.

The two major powers in the story are the UPSF (United Planets Space Force) and the Raalgon Empire (the extraterrestrials), who resemble humans with pointy ears and unusual haircolor).

One of the largest points of dispute in the story is Tylor&#x27;s competence. Several characters say of Tylor, &quot;I can&#x27;t decide if he&#x27;s an idiot or a genius.&quot; The answer is a mystery left up to viewers.

==Production==
According to &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; by Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy: &quot;The character [Tylor] is a cartoon version of Hitoshi Taira, the lazy protagonist of the 1962 live-action movie &quot;Japan&#x27;s Irresponsible Age&quot; who was played by comedian Hitoshi Ueki. This popular satire on Japan&#x27;s salaryman culture featured a feckless individual who always managed to come out on top, advancing up promotional ladders when accidents befall his superiors or lucking into important business information simply by malingering and goofing off. The series and its theatrical spin-offs were revived in 1990, suspiciously close to the time when &quot;Hummingbirds&quot;-creator Hitoshi Yoshioka would have begun work on this anime version.&quot;

==Characters==
 is a mysterious, irresponsible man. Tylor, age 20, joined the United Planets Space Force for what he hoped would be an easy life. Originally assigned to the Pension department, he unwittingly foiled a terrorist plot to kidnap and kill a retired UPSF admiral when he tried to deliver a late check by hand. For saving the war hero&#x27;s life, Tylor was promoted to Captain and placed in command of the destroyer Soyokaze (the UPSF dumping ground for trouble makers and the unwanted). Tylor has, as his superiors have put it, &#x27;The Devil&#x27;s own luck&#x27; and usually can get out of any situation relatively unscathed, avoiding multiple assassination attempts and defeating enemy groups of vastly superior numbers. He is very laid back and does not really care for the rules, using his authority as captain to change whatever regulations seem too uptight for him. He is also easily led by his crew, who are able to convince him to allow them to wear comfortable clothes on watch, hold a swimsuit competition, and let the surgeon drink while on duty. The UPSF and the Raalgon Empire are constantly debating whether Tylor possesses the most brilliant military mind or whether he is just a lucky moron.&lt;br&gt;
 is a very strait-laced, by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attempts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike Yamamoto, has no problem telling Tylor that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor&#x27;s obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the Soyokaze. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.&lt;br&gt;
 is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the Soyokaze and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by Tylor&#x27;s lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic&#x27;s office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier&#x27;s code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.&lt;br&gt;
 is the 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (under the assumption that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it&#x27;s a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing in.&lt;br&gt;
 is the commander of one of the Raalgon fleets. He speaks candidly with the Empress, in stark contrast to the bowing and scraping and lying of the rest of her court. Dom gains Azalyn&#x27;s trust and becomes one of her more valued advisors. Dom is also very interested in Tylor, feeling that Tylor would be not only a worthy adversary, but also a challenge for anyone to decipher and defeat. It is Dom who assigned Harumi to spy on the Soyokaze&#x27;s enigmatic captain, but even with the constant data coming in from his valued spy, Dom is still unsure whether Tylor really knows what he is doing or if he is just a fool.&lt;br&gt;
==Light novels==
&quot;The Irresponsible Captain Tylor&quot; is adapted from the series of light novels &quot;The Most Irresponsible Man in Space&quot; by Hitoshi Yoshioka and published under Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s Fujimi Fantasia Bunko label. When the anime adaptation began, the series consisted of three trilogies and several side stories which are partly adapted by anime. Additional novel series followed, with &quot;The True Irresponsible Captain Tylor&quot; being a reprint of the original series with three volumes of new content. No light novels in the series have been translated.

==Anime==

The anime adaptation began as a 26-part TV series broadcast on TV Tokyo and ran from January 25 to July 19, 1993. All episodes were directed by Kōichi Mashimo, and were produced by Tatsunoko Production. The OVA was a 10-part series released between October 1, 1994 and August 1, 1996. All episodes were directed between Mashimo and Koji Sawai, and were produced by Studio Deen. The story follows the career of Justy Ueki Tylor, a young man who decided to join the United Planets Space Force believing it will lead to an easy life. He later finds himself in command of his own spaceship, the &quot;Soyokaze&quot;, where he finds himself at odds with his military enemy, the Raalgon Empire, and his own crew due to his laid-back manner.

The TV series featured an opening and closing performed by Mari Sasaki: &quot;Just Think Of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Downtown Dance&quot; respectively. They, along with the rest of the soundtrack for both the TV series and OVA were released by AnimeTrax on June 5, 2001.

The TV series was released in the United States by Right Stuf first on VHS between October 21, 1997 and July 21, 1998, and was later released on DVD on January 30, 2001. The OVA was released on VHS and DVD between July 31 and September 25, 2001. The series was released as a digitally remastered thinkpak by Right Stuf&#x27;s division Nozomi Entertainment, with the TV series released on May 26, 2009 and the OVA on August 28, 2009. The series was released on Blu-ray on October 5, 2021.

A short anime series, titled and produced by Seven, aired from July 11 to September 26, 2017. It was streamed in English by Crunchyroll.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to both the TV series and the OVA were both released on CD by ADV Films and Right Stuf on June 5, 2001.

==Manga==
Set years after the OVAs, the manga &quot;Love &amp; War,&quot; with a story by Hitoshi Yoshioka and artwork by Kotaro Mori, was published by Enterbrain in three volumes in 2001 and 2002. In it, Tylor is now a vice admiral and captain of the battleship &quot;Omi.&quot; This time he gets with his fiancée and political officer Lt. Cmdr. Yuriko Star and his staff officer and adjutant Cmdr. Makoto Yamamoto in a time travel adventure back into the past of Raalgon during the reign of Goza XV.
The manga is unfinished, but Yoshioka adapted and finished the story as the first two side-story volumes of &quot;The True Irresponsible Captain Tylor&quot; reprint series in 2003 and 2004, with Mori again providing illustrations.

<doc id="473077" wikidata="Q44367" url="?curid=473077" title="Split-finger fastball">
<text>A split-finger fastball or splitter is an off-speed pitch in baseball that initially looks like a fastball from the batters perspective, but then drops suddenly. Derived from the forkball, it is aptly named because the pitcher puts the index and middle finger on different sides of the ball. 

==History==
The splitter grew out of a much older pitch, the forkball, which was first used in the major leagues in the 1920s. The modern splitter is often credited to baseball coach Fred Martin, who threw the pitch in the minor leagues as a changeup of sorts. When a young Bruce Sutter returned from surgery to find his fastball had lost velocity, Martin taught Sutter the pitch. Sutter&#x27;s success as a closer helped popularize the pitch.

Another early proponent of the splitter was Roger Craig, a pitcher-turned-manager, in the 1980s. He taught it to a number of pitchers on the teams he coached, the Detroit Tigers and San Francisco Giants. Longtime player and manager Mike Scioscia called the splitter &quot;the pitch of the &#x27;80s.&quot;

The splitter eventually lost popularity in MLB after concerns arose that extensive use of the pitch could rob pitchers of fastball speed and increase injury risk Several major league teams discourage pitching prospects from throwing or learning the pitch. In 2011, only 15 starting pitchers used it as part of their regular repertoire. Splitter usage has begun to see a resurgence in the 2020s, with little research indicating support for the increased injury risk, and the MLB success of Japanese splitter-throwers from NPB, where the splitter has long been a primary pitch, as key factors.

==Purpose and technique==
The split-finger grip is similar to the forkball grip. However, the forkball is held further back and wider between the fingers and is usually thrown with a wrist flip that makes it slower than the splitter. The split-finger is often recommended as an alternative to breaking pitches to young players because of its simplicity and the significantly reduced risk of injury.

An off-speed pitch, the splitter is generally thrown slower than the pitcher&#x27;s fastball. According to PITCHf/x, the average four-seam fastball from a right-handed pitcher in 2010 was 92 mph, whereas the average splitter was 85 mph and the average changeup 83 mph.

The motion of a split-finger pitch is similar to the outlawed spitball and at one time the pitch was known as the &quot;dry spitter&quot;. When thrown, the pitcher must emphasize the downward pull of the pitch at the end of his motion. Thrusting the hand and forearm downward causes reduced backspin relative to a fastball, thus giving the appearance of &quot;drop off the table&quot; movement from the pitch. When thrown correctly, the split-finger&#x27;s apparent last-second drop causes many batters to hit the top half of the baseball, thereby inducing a ground ball. The split-finger fastball is a very effective pitch with runners on base; a common tactic is using the split-finger to cause the batter to hit into a double play. 

==Notable splitter pitchers==

Bruce Sutter, a Hall of Fame inductee, was a dominant closer in the 1970s and &#x27;80s and made heavy use of the split-finger pitch. He won the 1979 Cy Young and became the only National League pitcher to lead the league in saves 5 times. 

The split-finger was a dominant pitch for Ron Darling on the 1986 World Champion New York Mets staff.

David Cone was famous for his splitter, used most often in the middle and later part of his career. A major strikeout pitch for him, Cone would throw it harder like a fastball to get swinging strikes. He also was very effective in throwing it slower, using it as a changeup to throw off hitters&#x27; timing. Jack Morris learned the pitch from Roger Craig in 1980, and it became an effective &quot;out&quot; pitch for the Tigers&#x27; hurler. Mike Scott also learned the pitch from Craig after the 1984 season, and it turned his career around. He won the 1986 NL Cy Young award and posted a league-leading 306 strikeouts. 

Randy Johnson developed a splitter later in his career after losing some of his fastball velocity.

Roger Clemens developed a splitter later in his career as well, using it frequently as a strikeout pitch. 

John Smoltz and Curt Schilling were also pitchers from the 1990s and early 2000s who used the splitter as a key pitch in their arsenals.

Probably one of the best splitters, if not the best pitches, is used by Kevin Gausman of the Toronto Blue Jays.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Casey Mize uses a hard splitter with excellent control as his strikeout pitch.

Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Aroldis Chapman also developed a splitter toward the tail end of his age 32 season. He threw the pitch about 12% of the time in April 2021, generating an 85.7% strikeout rate and a -6.7 run value/100 — one of the most effective pitches in his arsenal and in the major leagues as a whole.

Cincinnati Reds reliever Fernando Cruz uses the splitter as his strikeout pitch.

<doc id="473082" wikidata="Q623476" url="?curid=473082" title="Lombard League">
<text>The Lombard League (; ) was an alliance of cities formed in 1167, and supported by the popes, to counter the attempts by the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman emperors to establish direct royal administrative control over the cities of the Kingdom of Italy (which was part of the Holy Roman Empire) after many decades of de-facto local self-governance.

At its apex, it included most of the cities of Northern Italy, but its membership changed with time. With the death of the third and last Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II, in 1250, it became obsolete and was disbanded.

Although having mainly a military purpose, the Lombard League also had its own stable government (, i.e. Regents of Lombardy), because of which it can be considered as one of the first examples of confederation in Europe.

== History ==
The association succeeded the Veronese League, established in 1164 by Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and the Republic of Venice, after Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa had claimed direct Imperial control over Italy at the 1158 Diet of Roncaglia and began to replace the podestà magistrates by his own commissioners. It was backed by Pope Alexander III (the town of Alessandria was named in his honour), who also wished to see Frederick&#x27;s power in Italy decline.

Formed according to tradition following the oath of Pontida on 7 April 1167, the Lombard League included—beside Verona, Padua, Vicenza and Venice—cities like Crema, Cremona, Mantua, Piacenza, Bergamo, Brescia, Genoa, Bologna, Milan, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Treviso, Vercelli, Lodi, Parma, Ferrara and even some lords, such as the Marquis Malaspina and Ezzelino da Romano.

Though not a declared separatist movement, the League openly challenged the emperor&#x27;s claim to power (). Frederick I strove against the cities, especially Milan, which already had been occupied and devastated in 1162. He nevertheless was no longer able to play off the cities against each other.

At the Battle of Legnano on 29 May 1176, the emperor&#x27;s army finally was defeated. The Treaty of Venice, which took place in 1177, established a six-year truce from August 1178 to 1183, when in the Peace of Constance a compromise was found where after the Italian cities agreed to remain loyal to the Holy Roman Empire but retained local jurisdiction and over their territories. Among the League&#x27;s members, Milan, now favoured by the emperor, began to take a special position, which sparked conflicts mainly with the citizens of Cremona.
The Lombard League was renewed several times and upon the death of Frederick I&#x27;s son Henry VI in 1197 once again gained prestige, while Henry&#x27;s minor son, Frederick II, elected king, had to fight for the throne against his Welf rival Otto IV. In 1226 Frederick, sole king since 1218 and emperor since 1220, aimed to convene the princes of the Holy Roman Empire in Italy in order to prepare the Sixth Crusade.

The efforts of Emperor Frederick II to gain greater power in Italy were aborted by the cities, which earned the League an Imperial ban. The emperor&#x27;s measures included the taking of Vicenza and his victory in the 1237 Battle of Cortenuova which established the reputation of the emperor as a skillful strategist. Nevertheless, he misjudged his strength, rejecting all Milanese peace overtures and insisting on unconditional surrender. It was a moment of grave historic importance, when Frederick&#x27;s hatred coloured his judgment and blocked all possibilities of a peaceful settlement. Milan and five other cities withstood his attacks, and in October 1238 he had to unsuccessfully raise the siege of Brescia.
The Lombard League once again receiving papal support by Gregory IX, who excommunicated Frederick II in 1239, and effectively countered the emperor&#x27;s efforts. During the 1248 Siege of Parma, the Imperial camp was assaulted and taken, and in the ensuing battle the Imperial side was routed. Frederick II lost the Imperial treasure and with it any hope of maintaining the impetus of his struggle against the rebellious communes and against the pope. The League was dissolved in 1250 when Frederick II died. Under his later successors the Empire exerted much less influence on Italian politics.

== Civil government ==
In addition of being a military alliance, the Lombard League was one of the first examples of confederal system in the world of communes. Indeed, the League had a distinct council of its members, called , consisting of representatives appointed by individual municipalities, and voted by majority in various fields (such as the admission of new members, war and peace with the Emperor), powers that grew more and more with the years. The obtained regulatory, tax and judicial power, a system comparable to that of a present-day republic.

In the first period of the League the communes had little to do with confederal affairs, and the members of the were independent. In the second period, the municipalities gained some influence, but as a counterweight, members were more involved in the municipal council policy. In addition, the League abolished the duties with the creation of a customs union.

<text>TIHKAL: The Continuation is a 1997 book written by Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin about a family of psychoactive drugs known as tryptamines. A sequel to &quot;PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story&quot;, &quot;TIHKAL&quot; is an acronym that stands for &quot;Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved&quot;.

==Content==
&quot;TIHKAL&quot;, much like its predecessor &quot;PIHKAL&quot;, is divided into two parts. The first part, for which all rights are reserved, begins with a fictionalized autobiography, picking up where the similar section of &quot;PIHKAL&quot; left off; it then continues with a collection of essays on topics ranging from psychotherapy and the Jungian mind to the prevalence of DMT in nature, ayahuasca and the War on Drugs. The second part of &quot;TIHKAL&quot;, which may be conditionally distributed for non-commercial reproduction , is a detailed synthesis manual for 55 psychedelic compounds (many discovered by Alexander Shulgin himself), including their chemical structures, dosage recommendations, and qualitative comments. Shulgin has made the second part freely available on Erowid while the first part is available only in the printed text.

As with &quot;PIHKAL&quot;, the Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public&#x27;s access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times. Following a raid of his laboratory in 1994 by the United States DEA, Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA&#x27;s San Francisco Field Division, stated that &quot;It is our opinion that those books [referring to the previous work, &quot;PIHKAL&quot;] are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books.&quot;

<doc id="473086" wikidata="Q160215" url="?curid=473086" title="King Kong (2005 film)">
<text>King Kong is a 2005 epic adventure monster film co-written, produced, and directed by Peter Jackson. It is the ninth entry in the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise and the second remake of the 1933 film of the same title, the first being the 1976 remake. The film stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody. Set in 1933, it follows the story of an ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious Skull Island. There they encounter prehistoric creatures and a legendary giant gorilla known as Kong, whom they capture and take to New York City.

Development began in early 1995, when Universal Pictures approached Jackson to direct the remake of the original 1933 film. The project stalled in early 1997, as several ape and giant monster-related films were under production at the time and Jackson planned to direct &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series. As the first two films in the &quot;Rings&quot; trilogy became commercially successful, Universal went back to Jackson in early 2003, expressing interest in restarting development on the project, to which Jackson eventually agreed. Filming for &quot;King Kong&quot; took place in New Zealand from September 2004 to March 2005. It was the most expensive film ever produced at the time of its release, as its budget climbed from an initial $150 million to a then record-breaking $207 million.

&quot;King Kong&quot; premiered at New York City on December 5, 2005, and was theatrically released in Germany and United States on December 14. The film received critical acclaim, and eventually appeared in several top ten lists for 2005; it was praised for the special effects, performances, sense of spectacle and comparison to the 1933 original, though some criticisms were raised over its 3-hour runtime. It was a commercial success, grossing over $556.9 million, and became the fourth-highest-grossing film in Universal Pictures history at that time and the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2005. It also generated $100 million in DVD sales upon its home video release in March 2006. It won three Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. A tie-in video game was released alongside the film, which also became a commercial and critical success.

==Plot==
In 1933, during the Great Depression, struggling New York City vaudeville performer Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with actor Bruce Baxter. Ann is hesitant to join the picture until she learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. Filming takes place on the &quot;SS Venture&quot;, a small cargo ship belonging to the Dutch East Indies colony, anchored in Surabaya under Captain Englehorn. Carl claims the &quot;Venture&quot; will sail to Singapore, but in truth, he intends to film the mysterious Skull Island. Captain Englehorn reconsiders the voyage, prompted by his crew&#x27;s speculation of trouble ahead. During the voyage, Ann and Jack fall in love.

The &quot;Venture&quot; receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl&#x27;s arrest due to his defiance of the studio&#x27;s orders to cease production, and instructing Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on Skull Island. Carl and others, including his film crew consisting of cameraman Herb, assistant Preston and boom operator Mike, explore the island and are attacked by natives who kill Mike and a crewman. Englehorn rescues Carl’s group, but as they all prepare to leave, the natives secretly abduct Ann to offer her as a sacrifice to Kong, a ape. Jack notices Ann&#x27;s disappearance, and the crew returns to the island, but Kong flees with Ann into the jungle. Carl catches a glimpse of Kong and becomes determined to film him.

Ann wins Kong over with her juggling and dancing skills, and begins to grasp his intelligence and capacity for emotion. Englehorn organizes a rescue party, led by his first mate Hayes and Jack, and accompanied by Carl, Herb, Baxter and Preston. The party gets caught between a herd of &quot;Brontosaurus baxteri&quot; and a pack of Utahraptor-like &quot;Venatosaurus saevidicus&quot; hunting them, with Herb and several other men killed in the resulting stampede. Baxter and others return to the ship.

The remaining party members continue through the jungle when Kong attacks, making them fall into a ravine where Carl loses his camera. Kong rescues Ann from three Tyrannosaurus-like &quot;Vastatosaurus rex&quot;, bringing her to his den in the mountains. The remaining rescue party are attacked by giant insects in the ravine, resulting in the death of Hayes and most of the rescue party, but Preston, Carl, Jack, and Hayes&#x27; apprentice Jimmy are rescued by Baxter and Englehorn. Jack searches for Ann alone, while Carl decides to capture Kong. Jack finds Kong&#x27;s lair and accidentally awakens him, but escapes with Ann to where the crew is waiting to capture the pursuing Kong. As Ann begs the crew not to harm him, Kong kills several sailors, but is subdued when Carl knocks him out with chloroform.

In New York City, around the Christmas season, Carl presents &quot;Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; on Broadway, starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann, who refused to take part in the performance, is played by an anonymous chorus girl. Agitated by the chorus girl not being Ann and flashes from cameras, Kong breaks free from the chains, wrecks the theater, and bursts out into the streets of New York in search of Ann, chasing Jack before encountering her again. The U.S. Army attacks, and Kong tries getting Ann and himself to safety by climbing to the top of the Empire State Building.

Six United States Navy biplanes arrive; Kong downs three of them, but is mortally wounded from the planes&#x27; gunfire and falls from the building after he dies. As Jack reaches the top of the building to comfort and embrace Ann, civilians, policemen, and soldiers gather around the beast&#x27;s corpse in the street, one bystander commenting the airplanes got him. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes one last look at Kong and, before walking away, says sadly, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast&quot;.

==Cast==
* Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, a struggling vaudeville actress who is desperate for work. Carl first meets her when she tries to steal an apple from a fruit stand. Further into the voyage, she falls in love with Jack and forms a special relationship with Kong.
* Jack Black as Carl Denham, a film director who obtained the map to Skull Island. Due to his debts, Carl starts to lose his moral compass and obsesses over his film to the point that he disregards safety.
* Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll, a screenwriter who falls in love with Ann. He unwittingly becomes part of the voyage when, while delivering a script to Denham, he is deliberately delayed by the latter before he can get off the &quot;Venture&quot;. He is the only member of the crew who agrees with Ann that Kong should be left alone. 
* Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Englehorn, the German captain of the &quot;Venture&quot;. Englehorn shows a dislike for Denham, presumably because of his obsessive nature.
* Colin Hanks as Preston, Denham&#x27;s neurotic but honest personal assistant.
* Jamie Bell as Jimmy, a naive teenager who was found on the &quot;Venture&quot;, wild and abandoned.
* Evan Parke as Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Hayes, Englehorn&#x27;s first mate and a mentor to Jimmy, who leads Ann&#x27;s rescue mission because of his army training and combat experience gained during World War I.
* Lobo Chan as Choy, Lumpy&#x27;s best friend and a janitor on the &quot;Venture&quot;.
* Kyle Chandler as Bruce Baxter, an actor who specializes in adventure films. He abandons Ann&#x27;s rescue mission but brings Englehorn to rescue the search party from the insect pit, and is given credit for rescuing Ann during the Broadway display of Kong.
* Andy Serkis as Kong (motion capture), a tall prehistoric silverback mountain gorilla who is around 100–150 years old. He is the last of his species, &quot;Megaprimatus kong&quot;, and the possible descendant of the Chororapithecus.
** Serkis also plays Lumpy, the ship&#x27;s cook, barber, and surgeon. A brave sailor, he warns Denham about rumors he has heard about Skull Island and Kong.
* John Sumner as Herb, Denham&#x27;s loyal cameraman.
* Craig Hall as Mike, Denham&#x27;s soundman for the journey.
* William Johnson as Manny, an elderly vaudevillian actor and colleague of Darrow.
* Mark Hadlow as Harry, a struggling vaudevillian actor.
* Jed Brophy and Todd Rippon appeared in the film as crew members.
In addition, director Jackson appears with makeup artist Rick Baker (who had portrayed Kong and designed makeup for the 1976 version) as the pilot and gunner on the airplane that kills the title character, his children appear as New York children, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; co-producer and second unit director Rick Porras and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; director Frank Darabont appear as a gunners in the other airplanes, and Bob Burns and his wife appear as New York bystanders. Frequent Jackson collaborator Howard Shore makes a cameo appearance as the conductor of the New York theater from where Kong escapes. Shore was initially set to compose for the film before his exit.

Watts, Black, and Brody were the first choices for their respective roles with no other actors considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with the original Ann Darrow, Fay Wray. Jackson wanted Wray to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue, but she died during pre-production at 96 years old. Black was cast as Carl Denham based on his performance in the 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, which had impressed Jackson. For inspiration, Black studied P. T. Barnum and Orson Welles. &quot;I didn&#x27;t study [Welles] move for move. It was just to capture the spirit. Very reckless guy. I had tapes of him drunk off his ass.&quot; The native extras on Skull Island were portrayed by a mix of Asian, African, Maori and Polynesian actors sprayed with dark makeup to achieve a consistent pigmentation.

==Production==
===Development===

====Earlier attempts and 1990s====
Peter Jackson was nine years old when he first saw the 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the television when Kong was shot and fell off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he attempted to recreate the film using his parents&#x27; Super 8 mm film camera and a model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother&#x27;s fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. &quot;King Kong&quot; eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of &quot;King Kong&quot; and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film &quot;Braindead&quot;.

During the filming of Jackson&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, Universal Pictures was impressed with Jackson&#x27;s dailies and early visual effects footage. The studio was adamant to work with Jackson on his next project and, in late 1995, offered him the chance to direct a remake of the 1954 film &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. He turned down the offer, but Universal became aware of Jackson&#x27;s obsession with &quot;King Kong&quot; and subsequently offered him the opportunity to direct that remake. The studio did not have to worry about lawsuits concerning the film rights from RKO Pictures (the studio behind the 1933 film) because the King Kong character is held in the public domain. Jackson initially turned down the &quot;King Kong&quot; offer, but he &quot;quickly became disturbed by the fact that someone else would take it over,&quot; Jackson continued, &quot;and make it into a terrible film; that haunted me and I eventually said yes to Universal.&quot;

At the same time, Jackson was working with Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Films to purchase the film rights of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, while 20th Century Fox was trying to hire him for the 2001 remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. Jackson turned down &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; rights, Jackson decided to move forward on &quot;King Kong&quot;. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance &quot;King Kong&quot; with Jackson&#x27;s production company WingNut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of final cut privilege, a percentage of the gross profits, as well as artistic control; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand. The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife Fran Walsh, began working on the &quot;King Kong&quot; script. In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on Asia&#x27;s mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-World War I fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three &quot;V. rex&quot; also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the &quot;V. rex&quot; jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.

Universal approved of the script with Robert Zemeckis as executive producer, and pre-production for &quot;King Kong&quot; commenced. The plan was to begin filming sometime in 1997 for a summer 1998 release date. Weta Digital and Weta Workshop, under the supervision of Richard Taylor and Christian Rivers, began work on early visual effects tests, specifically the complex task of building a CGI version of New York City circa 1933. Jackson and Walsh progressed with a second draft script, sets were being designed and location scouting commenced in Sumatra and New Zealand. In late 1996, Jackson flew to production of the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; in Mexico to discuss the part of Ann Darrow with Kate Winslet, with whom he previously worked with on his 1994 film &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;. Minnie Driver was also being reportedly considered. Jackson&#x27;s choices for Jack Driscoll and Carl Denham included George Clooney and Robert De Niro. However, development for &quot;King Kong&quot; was stalled in January 1997 when Universal became concerned over the upcoming release of the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, as well as other ape-related remakes with the 1998 film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; and the 2001 film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. Universal abandoned &quot;King Kong&quot; in February 1997 after Weta Workshop and Weta Digital had already designed six months&#x27; worth of pre-production. Jackson then decided to start work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series.

====Revival of the project====
With the financial and critical success of the 2001 film &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and the 2002 film &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Universal approached Jackson in early 2003, during the post-production of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, concerning his interest in restarting development on &quot;King Kong&quot;. In March 2003, Universal set a target December 2005 release date and Jackson and Walsh brought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; co-writer Philippa Boyens on to help rewrite their 1996 script. Jackson offered New Line Cinema the opportunity to co-finance with Universal, but they declined. Universal and Jackson originally projected a $150 million budget, which eventually rose to $175 million. Jackson made a deal with Universal whereby he would be paid a $20 million salary against 20% of the box office gross for directing, producing and co-writing. He shared that fee with co-writers Walsh (which also covered her producing credit) and Boyens. However, if &quot;King Kong&quot; were to go over its $175 million budget, the penalties would be covered by Jackson.

Immediately after the completion of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, Weta Workshop and Weta Digital, supervised by Taylor, Rivers, and Joe Letteri, started pre-production on &quot;King Kong&quot;. Jackson brought back most of the crew he had on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series, including cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, production designer Grant Major, art directors Simon Bright and Dan Hennah, conceptual designer Alan Lee, and editor Jamie Selkirk. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens began to write a new script in late October 2003. Jackson acknowledged that he was highly unsatisfied with the original 1996 script. &quot;That was actually just Fran and Peter very hurriedly getting something down on paper&quot;, Boyens explained. &quot;It was more one of many possible ways the story could go.&quot; The writers chose to base the new screenplay on the 1933 film rather than the 1996 script. They also included scenes from James Ashmore Creelman&#x27;s screenplay that were either abandoned or omitted during production of the original film. In the scene where Kong shakes the surviving sailors pursuing Ann and himself from a log into the ravine, for example, directors Merian Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack originally intended to depict giant spiders emerging from the rock to devour their bodies. This was cut from the original release print, and remains known to &quot;Kong&quot; fans only via a rare still that appeared in &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;. Jackson included this scene and elaborated upon it. Jackson, Walsh and Boyens also cited Delos W. Lovelace&#x27;s 1932 novelisation of &quot;King Kong&quot; as inspiration, which included the character Lumpy (Andy Serkis). To make the relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong plausible, the writers studied hours of gorilla footage. Jackson also optioned &quot;Early Havoc&quot;, a memoir written by vaudeville performer June Havoc to help Walsh and Boyens flesh out Ann Darrow&#x27;s characterisation. Carl Denham was intentionally modeled after and inspired by Orson Welles. Their new draft was finished in February 2004.

===Filming===
Principal photography started on September 6, 2004, at Camperdown Studios in Miramar, New Zealand. Camperdown housed the native village and the Great Wall, while the streets of New York City were constructed on its backlot and at Gracefield in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. The majority of the SS &quot;Venture&quot; scenes were shot aboard a full-scale deck constructed in the parking lot at Camperdown Studio and then were backed with a green screen, with the ocean digitally added in post. Scenes set in the Broadway theater from which King Kong makes his escape were filmed in Wellington&#x27;s Opera House and at the Auckland Civic Theatre. Filming also took place at Stone Street Studios, where a new sound stage was constructed to accommodate one of the sets. Over the course of filming the budget went from $175 million to $207 million over additional visual effects work needed, and Jackson extending the film&#x27;s running time by thirty minutes. Jackson covered most of the $32 million surplus himself and finished filming in March 2005.

The film&#x27;s budget climbed from an initial US$150 million to a then-record-breaking $207 million and received a subsidy of $34 million from New Zealand, making it at one point the most expensive film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film&#x27;s length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but they liked it so their concerns were addressed.

Other difficulties included Peter Jackson&#x27;s decision to change composers from Howard Shore to James Newton Howard seven weeks before the film opened.

===Visual effects===

Jackson saw &quot;King Kong&quot; as opportunity for technical innovations in motion capture, commissioning Christian Rivers of Weta Digital to supervise all aspects of Kong&#x27;s performance. Jackson decided early on that he did not want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage. Serkis was cast in the title role in April 2003 and prepared himself by working with gorillas at the London Zoo. He then traveled to Rwanda, observing the actions and behaviors of gorillas in the wild. Rivers explained that the detailed facial performance capture with Serkis was accomplished because of the similarities between human and gorilla faces. &quot;Gorillas have such a similar looking set of eyes and brows, you can look at those expressions and transpose your own interpretation onto them.&quot; Photos of silverback gorillas were also superimposed on Kong&#x27;s image in the early stages of animation. Serkis had to go through two hours of motion capture makeup every day, having 135 small markers attached to different spots on his face. Following principal photography, Serkis had to spend an additional two months on a motion capture stage, miming Kong&#x27;s movements for the film&#x27;s digital animators.

Apart from Kong, Skull Island is inhabited by dinosaurs and other large fauna. Inspired by Dougal Dixon&#x27;s works, the designers imagined what 65 million years or more of isolated evolution might have done to dinosaurs and the other creatures.

==Music==

The original score was initially set to be composed by Howard Shore, who had written several cues for the film. Due to creative differences with Jackson, Shore opted out of the project in October 2005 and subsequently James Newton Howard replaced him. With scoring beginning by late-October 2005, Howard had only five weeks to work on the film, as a result, he found the film &quot;hardest to compose&quot;. Recording sessions took place at the Sony Scoring Stage, California and Todd-AO, Los Angeles, consisting of 108-piece orchestra and 40-member choir, and a varied range of instruments used.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack includes Al Jolson&#x27;s recording of &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, Peggy Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, and some themes from Max Steiner&#x27;s soundtrack for the original 1933 film. The score was released on December 7, 2005, by Decca Records to positive response. Howard&#x27;s score was later nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.

==Marketing==
The marketing campaign started in full swing on June 27, 2005, when the teaser trailer made its debut, first online at the official Volkswagen website at 8:45 p.m. EDT, then 8:55 p.m. EDT across media outlets owned by NBCUniversal (the parent of Universal Studios), including NBC, Bravo!, CNBC, and MSNBC. That trailer appeared in theatres attached to &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, which opened on June 29.

Jackson also regularly published a series of &#x27;Production Diaries&#x27;, which chronicled the film&#x27;s production. The diaries started shortly after the DVD release of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; as a way to give Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; fans a glimpse of his next project. These diaries are edited into broadband-friendly installments of three or four minutes each. They consist of features that would normally be seen in a making-of documentary: a tour of the set, a roving camera introducing key players behind the scene, a peek inside the sound booth during last-minute dubbing, or Andy Serkis doing his ape movements in a motion capture studio.

A novelisation of the film and a prequel novel entitled &quot;King Kong: The Island of the Skull&quot; were also written. A multi-platform video game, entitled &quot;Peter Jackson&#x27;s King Kong&quot;, was released, which featured an alternate ending. There was also a hardback book entitled &quot;The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island&quot;, featuring artwork from Weta Workshop to describe the film&#x27;s fictional wildlife.

Jackson has expressed his desire to remaster the film in 3-D at some point in the future. Jackson was also seen shooting with a 3-D camera at times during the shoot of &quot;King Kong&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

In North America, &quot;King Kong&quot; grossed $9.8 million during its Wednesday opening and $50.1 million over its first weekend for a five-day total of $66.2 million from around 7,500 screens at 3,568 theaters. Some analysts considered these initial numbers disappointing, saying that studio executives had been expecting more. The film went on to gross $218.1 million in the North American market and ended up in the top five highest-grossing films of the year there. The film grossed an additional $338.8 million at the box office in other regions for a worldwide total of $556.9 million, which not only ranked it in the top five highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, but also helped the film bring back more than two-and-a-half times its production budget.

During its home video release, &quot;King Kong&quot; sold over $100 million worth of DVDs in the largest six-day performance in Universal Studios history. &quot;King Kong&quot; sold more than 7.6 million DVDs, accumulating nearly $194 million worth of sales numbers in the North American market alone. As of June 25, 2006, &quot;King Kong&quot; has generated almost $38 million from DVD rental gross. In February 2006, Turner Broadcasting System (TNT/TBS) and ABC paid Universal Pictures $26.5 million for the television rights to the film.

===Critical response===
&quot;King Kong&quot; received acclaim from critics. On aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 268 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Featuring state-of-the-art special effects, terrific performances, and a majestic sense of spectacle, Peter Jackson&#x27;s remake of &quot;King Kong&quot; is a potent epic that&#x27;s faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

It was placed on the &#x27;top ten&#x27; lists of several critics, with Roger Ebert giving it four stars, and listed it as 2005&#x27;s eighth-best film. The film received four Academy Award nominations, for Visual Effects, Sound Mixing (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, Hammond Peek), Sound Editing, and Production Design, winning all but the last. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the depiction of Kong the most convincing computer-generated character in film in 2005. Some criticised the film for retaining racist stereotypes that had been present in the 1933 film, though it was not suggested that Jackson had done this intentionally. &quot;King Kong&quot; ranks 450th on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewer Peter Bradshaw said that it &quot;certainly equals, and even exceeds, anything Jackson did in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; However, Charlie Brooker, also of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, gave a negative review in which he describes the film as &quot;sixteen times more overblown and histrionic than necessary&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Cinematic and literary allusions==
* Jack Black and critics have noted Carl Denham&#x27;s similarity to Orson Welles.
* When Driscoll is searching for a place to sleep in the animal storage hold, a box behind him reads &quot;Sumatran Rat Monkey – Beware the bite!&quot; This is a reference to the creature that causes mayhem in Jackson&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Braindead&quot;, itself a reference to the giant rat of Sumatra mentioned in Sherlock Holmes. In that film, the rat monkey is described as being found only on Skull Island.
* Jimmy reads part of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; while en route to Skull Island, at one point comparing their journey to that of the novella.

===References to original 1933 &quot;King Kong&quot;===
* Fay Wray, the original Ann Darrow, was asked by Jackson to appear in a brief cameo role in which she would utter the film&#x27;s final line: &quot;It was beauty killed the beast.&quot; At first, she flatly refused, but then seemed to consider the possibility. However, she died shortly after her meeting with Jackson. As in the original film, the line ultimately went to the character of Carl Denham.
* An ad for Universal is visible while Kong is tearing up Times Square. In the 1933 film, an ad for Columbia Pictures appeared in the same spot, and the production designers replicated it, but Columbia asked for a large amount of money for its use, so effects artists replaced it.
* When Denham is considering who to play the part before meeting Ann, he suggests &quot;Fay&quot;, but his assistant Preston replies, &quot;She&#x27;s doing a picture with RKO.&quot; Music from the 1933 film is heard, and Denham mutters, &quot;Cooper, huh? I might have known.&quot; Fay Wray starred in the 1933 film, which was directed by Merian C. Cooper and released by RKO. At the time she was performing in another Cooper/Schoedsack production, &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; with Robert Armstrong.
* In the 1933 film, Denham made up an &quot;Arabian proverb&quot; about &quot;beauty and beast&quot;. The 2005 remake repeats the fake proverb.
* Early in this film, Denham shoots a scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she&#x27;s never been on a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The dialogue they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.
* Kong&#x27;s New York stage appearance looks very much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film&#x27;s sacrifice scene, including the posts the &#x27;beauty&#x27; is tied to and the nearly identical performance, costumes, and blackface makeup of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner&#x27;s original score for the 1933 film.
* The battle between Kong and the final &quot;V. rex&quot; is almost move-for-move like the last half of the fight between Kong and the &quot;T. rex&quot; in the 1933 film, right down to Kong playing with the dinosaur&#x27;s broken jaw and then standing, beating his chest and roaring victoriously.
* After the crew captures Kong on the beach, Denham speaks a line from the 1933 film: &quot;The whole world will pay to see this! We&#x27;re millionaires, boys! I&#x27;ll share it with all of you. In a few months, his name will be up in lights on Broadway! KONG, THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD!&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;King Kong&quot; was released on DVD on March 28, 2006, in the United States and Canada by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. The three versions that came out are a single-disc fullscreen, a single-disc widescreen, and a two-disc &#x27;Widescreen Special Edition&#x27;.

A three-disc Deluxe Extended Edition was released on November 14, 2006, in the United States, and on November 3 in Australia. Twelve minutes were reinserted into the film, and an additional forty minutes included with the rest of the special features. The film was spread onto the first two discs with commentary by Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens, and some featurettes on discs one and two, whilst the main special features are on disc three. Another set was released, including a WETA figurine of a bullet-ridden Kong scaling the Empire State Building, roaring at the Navy with Ann in hand. The extended film amounts to 200 total minutes.

A special HD DVD version of &quot;King Kong&quot; was part of a promotional pack for the release of the external HD DVD Drive for the Xbox 360. The pack contained the HD DVD drive, the Universal Media Remote and &quot;King Kong&quot; on HD DVD. It was also available separately as a standard HD DVD. The film&#x27;s theatrical and extended cuts were released together on Blu-ray Disc on January 20, 2009. A re-release of the Blu-Ray with a new bonus disc containing nearly all of the extras from the 2-disc Special Edition DVD, the Deluxe Extended Edition 3-disc DVD, and the &quot;Peter Jackson&#x27;s Production Diaries&quot; 2-disc DVD titled the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; was released on February 7, 2017. An Ultra HD Blu-ray followed in July 2017.
== Cancelled sequel and reboot ==
In March 2021, Adam Wingard said in an interview that back in 2013, Peter Jackson had been interested in producing a sequel to the film, titled &quot;Skull Island&quot;, with Wingard as director and Simon Barrett writing it. Jackson had been impressed with Wingard&#x27;s work in &quot;You&#x27;re Next&quot;, and investigated a potential sequel. However, the King Kong rights had already been transferred to Warner Bros. by 2013, which complicated a sequel to a Universal-produced movie. Wingard says that Jackson was thinking of setting the proposed movie during World War I, which would make it a prequel, but that the studio was uninterested in a World War I era film. Wingard pivoted to offering a modern-day sequel, but ultimately nothing came of the proposal.

Ultimately, Warner Bros. rebooted the franchise with &quot;&quot; in 2017, which is part of the MonsterVerse. Wingard would later direct 2021&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; and its sequel 2024&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot;, other films set in the MonsterVerse.

==Theme park==

The Universal Orlando Resort location Islands of Adventure features an attraction called &quot;Skull Island: Reign of Kong&quot; which is based on Peter Jackson&#x27;s remake. While the King Kong part of the Universal Studios Hollywood resort was destroyed by a massive fire, a 3D short inspired by the film was eventually created in 2010, &quot;King Kong: 360 3-D&quot;, which is another attraction based on Peter Jackson&#x27;s remake.

<text>Lord Nairne is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created by Charles II for Sir Robert Nairne of Strathord in 1681, which since 1995 is held by the Viscount Mersey.

==History==
Sir Robert Nairne of Strathord (c. 1620–1683), a supporter of Charles II, who was created Baron Nairne in 1681. After his death without issue the barony passed to his son-in-law, Lord William Murray (c. 1664–1726), the younger son of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, husband of his only daughter Margaret Nairne (1669–1747). Lord William Murray, who took the name of Nairne and became 2nd Baron Nairne, joined the standard of the Jacobites in 1715; he was taken prisoner at the battle of Preston and was sentenced to death. He was, however, pardoned, but his title was forfeited. On 24 June 1721 he was created Earl of Nairne, Viscount of Stanley and Lord of [ ] in the Jacobite Peerage by the Old Pretender. His son John (c. 1691–1770), who but for the forfeiture would have been the 3rd Baron Nairne, was also taken prisoner at Preston, but he was soon set at liberty. In the rising of 1745 he was one of the Jacobite leaders, being present at the battles of Prestonpans, of Falkirk and of Culloden, and consequently he was attainted in 1746; but escaped to France. His son John (died 1782) was the father of William Murray Nairne (1757–1830), who, being restored to the barony of Nairne in 1824, became the 5th baron. He married Carolina, the daughter of Laurence Oliphant (one of the foremost supporters of the Jacobite cause), and a well known Scottish songwriter. The male line became extinct when his son William, the 6th baron (1808–1837), died unmarried. The next heir was a cousin, Margaret, Baroness Keith of Stonehaven Marischal (1788–1867), wife of Auguste Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut de la Billarderie, but she did not claim the title. In 1874, the right of her daughter, Emily the wife of the Henry, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne, was allowed by the House of Lords. The Marquess and Marchioness were both succeeded by their eldest son Henry Charles Keith Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne and 9th Lord Nairne. The lordship remained a subsidiary title of the marquessate until the death in 1944 of his grandson, Charles, 7th Marquess. Charles was succeeded in the marquessate by his cousin while the Scottish lordship passed to his sister Katherine Evelyn Constance Bigham, who became the 12th Lady Nairne. She was the wife of Edward Clive Bigham, 3rd Viscount Mersey. The Viscount and Viscountess were both succeeded by their eldest son, Richard, 4th Viscount and 13th Lord. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the 5th Viscount and 14th Lord Nairne.

The family seat is Bignor Park, near Pulborough, Sussex.

<doc id="473096" wikidata="Q1140377" url="?curid=473096" title="Jacksonville Barracudas">
<text>The Jacksonville Barracudas were a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Jacksonville, Florida. They were established in 2002, and played in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (2002–2003), the World Hockey Association 2 (2003–2004), and the Southern Professional Hockey League (2004–2008), before folding in 2008.

They won the WHA2 championship title in 2003 – becoming the only Jacksonville pro hockey team to win a league championship – and went to the playoffs three times in the SPHL, advancing to the league finals in 2007 and 2008. They ceased operations after the 2007–2008 season after being unable to secure a suitable venue for the upcoming season.

==History==
===ACHL and WHA2===
The Barracudas began play in the second Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL) in the 2002–03 season. Their original owner was David Waronker, who owned three other teams in the league. Jacksonville&#x27;s first professional hockey team since the Jacksonville Lizard Kings folded in 2000, they played their first home games at the Jacksonville Coliseum. However, the ACHL&#x27;s instability caused Waronker to lose confidence in the league. After the season, he announced he was withdrawing his four teams and creating a new league, the World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), which he envisioned as a developmental league for a proposed revival of the World Hockey Association.

Though the revived WHA never took the ice, the WHA2 did play its 2003–04 season. Jacksonville became the fledgling league&#x27;s most successful team, taking the regular season title and being the only team to draw an average of over 3,000 fans per game. They began the season in the old Jacksonville Coliseum, and moved to the new Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena when it was completed. However, the WHA2, which was largely controlled by Waronker, struggled. The Barracudas beat Miami two games to one and then swept Macon two games to none bringing Jacksonville its only professional hockey championship. Shortly thereafter the WHA2 collapsed, and many of its teams joined the new Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).

===SPHL===
In 2004, a group of Jacksonville investors organized to purchase the Barracudas from Waronker and join the newly formed SPHL. The team ended the 2004–05 season with a third-place finish and a semi-final loss in the playoffs, and finished the 2005–06 season at the bottom of the SPHL standings. Attendance was modest in the first two years in the SPHL; they drew an average of just below 3,000 in 2005–2006. The Barracudas improved both their record and their attendance the following season; under new coach Rick Allain, they finished the regular season sixth in the league with a 25–24–7 record. This qualified them for the 2007 playoffs, where they defeated the Columbus Cottonmouths 3–1 in the semi-final series, vaulting Jacksonville into the SPHL Finals for their first time. They were ultimately defeated by the Fayetteville FireAntz 3–1 in the finals series. Their on-ice success, combined with schedule changes that allowed them to play more home games after football season, saw their attendance improve measurably for the 2006–07 season.

Still, however, management at the 8,500-seat Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena worried that the team&#x27;s revenues were too low to justify the expense of setting up the facility for ice hockey. After the season, the Arena proposed an increase in the Barracudas&#x27; yearly lease that was beyond what the team could afford. For the 2007–08 season, they relocated to Jacksonville Ice, a local 900-seat recreational ice rink. They continued their on-ice success, qualifying for the playoffs and advancing to the league finals for the second year in a row, ultimately losing to the Knoxville Ice Bears. However, the new venue was too small for the team to be financially viable, and unable to secure any other arena lease, the Barracudas suspended operations after the season. While team officials believed that an arena of between 3,000 and 6,000 seats would allow the team to be viable, the Barracudas have not returned to the ice since.

<text>Sahlen Field is a baseball park in Buffalo, New York, United States. Originally known as Pilot Field, the venue has since been named Downtown Ballpark, North AmeriCare Park, Dunn Tire Park, and Coca-Cola Field. Home to the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, it opened on April 14, 1988, and can seat up to 16,600 people, making it the highest-capacity Triple-A ballpark in the United States. It replaced the Bisons&#x27; former home, War Memorial Stadium, where the team played from 1979 to 1987.

The stadium was the first retro-classic ballpark built in the world, and was designed with plans for Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion. Buffalo had not had an MLB team since the Buffalo Blues played for the Federal League in 1915. However, Bisons owner Robert E. Rich Jr. was unsuccessful in his efforts to bring an MLB franchise to the stadium between 1988 and 1995. The stadium was a temporary home to the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB in 2020 and 2021 when they were displaced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sahlen Field was previously home to the Buffalo Nighthawks of the Ladies Professional Baseball League in 1998, the Buffalo Bulls of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2000, and the Empire State Yankees of the International League in 2012. In addition to concerts and professional wrestling, the stadium has hosted major events including the National Old-Timers Baseball Classic (1988–1990), Triple-A All-Star Game (1988, 2012), StarGaze (1992–1993), World University Games (1993) and National Buffalo Wing Festival (2002–2019, 2025–present).

==History==

===Professional baseball in Buffalo, 1877–1970===

Buffalo began hosting professional baseball in 1877, when the Buffalo Bisons of the League Alliance began play at Riverside Park. Over the next century, the city hosted major and minor league teams including the Buffalo Bisons (IA, 1878, 1887–1888), Buffalo Bisons (NL, 1879–1885), Buffalo Bisons (PL, 1890), and the Buffalo Blues (FL, 1914–1915). The longest-tenured franchise was the minor league Buffalo Bisons, which was founded in 1886 and played exclusively in the International League starting in 1912. This club played at Olympic Park until 1923, at which point that venue was demolished and replaced by Offermann Stadium.

Buffalo was awarded an expansion franchise by the Continental League of Major League Baseball in January 1960, and made plans to play at War Memorial Stadium beginning with the 1961 season. However, the league folded before the season began. The Buffalo Bisons remained in the International League and began play at War Memorial Stadium in 1961, as Offermann Stadium had already been slated for demolition.

In April 1968, Robert O. Swados and his investment group, which included George Steinbrenner, presented their bid for a Buffalo expansion franchise to the National League Expansion Committee. This bid included plans for a $50 million domed stadium that was designed by the architects of the Astrodome and had a capacity of 45,000. Buffalo was one of five finalists for the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion, but franchises were awarded to the Montreal Expos and San Diego Padres in May 1968.

Erie County went on to modify the planned domed stadium to accommodate the Buffalo Bills, approving its construction as a 60,000-seat football venue in Lancaster that could also host baseball. However, bids for the stadium in 1970 came in over budget, and the project stalled. Bills owner Ralph Wilson threatened to move the Bills if action was not taken to replace the aging War Memorial Stadium, forcing Erie County to abandon the domed stadium in favor of building open-air Rich Stadium in Orchard Park. Major League Baseball had planned on relocating the struggling Washington Senators franchise to Buffalo, but when the domed stadium wasn&#x27;t built it instead became the Texas Rangers. The Buffalo Bisons moved mid-season in 1970 and became the Winnipeg Whips, leaving Buffalo without professional baseball.

===Planning and construction, 1978–1987===
Mayor James D. Griffin and an investment group purchased the Jersey City A&#x27;s of the Double-A class Eastern League for $55,000 in 1978, and the team began play as the Buffalo Bisons at War Memorial Stadium in 1979. This new franchise assumed the history of prior Buffalo Bisons teams that had played in the city from 1877 to 1970. Rich Products heir Robert E. Rich Jr. purchased the Bisons for $100,000 in 1983, and upgraded the team to the Triple-A class American Association in 1985 after buying out the Wichita Aeros for $1 million. The Bisons began drawing record crowds with promotional tie-ins, most notably annual post-game concerts by The Beach Boys.

Strong political support grew to replace the aging War Memorial Stadium with what was originally known as Downtown Buffalo Sports Complex. The City of Buffalo originally hired HOK Sport to design a $90 million domed stadium with a capacity of 40,000 on 13 acres of land, but the project was scaled back after New York State only approved $22.5 million in funding instead of the $40 million requested. A separate athletic facility to service the City Campus of Erie Community College was part of the proposed complex, and was eventually built several years later as the Burt Flickinger Center.

St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church originally occupied what would become the venue&#x27;s land at the corner of Washington Street and Swan Street, and Randall&#x27;s Boarding House originally occupied the adjacent lot on Swan Street. Mark Twain famously was a resident of the boarding house while editor of the &quot;Buffalo Express&quot;. Constructed between 1846 and 1848, the church remained in use until 1893 and was demolished in 1906.
The land then became the site of Ellsworth Statler&#x27;s first hotel, Hotel Statler, in 1907. It was later renamed Hotel Buffalo after Statler built a new hotel on Niagara Square in 1923 and sold his former location. Hotel Buffalo was demolished in 1968, and the land became a parking lot. The City of Buffalo would later acquire the land through eminent domain.

HOK Sport (now known as Populous) designed the downtown venue as the first retro-classic ballpark in the world. The open-air venue was designed to incorporate architecture from the neighboring Joseph Ellicott Historic District, most notably the Ellicott Square Building and Old Post Office. The venue&#x27;s exterior would be constructed from precast concrete, featuring arched window openings at the mezzanine level, rusticated joints, and inset marble panels. Located close to Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and along the newly built Buffalo Metro Rail, the venue would be an attractive and accessible destination for suburban residents. The same design firm would later bring this concept to Major League Baseball with Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

The baseball field itself would feature a Kentucky Bluegrass playing surface and have dimensions that were designed to mirror those of pitcher-friendly Royals Stadium. Buffalo Bisons management insisted the field have deep fences after War Memorial Stadium acquired a poor reputation for allowing easy home runs. Roger Bossard, head groundskeeper of Comiskey Park, served as consultant for the project.

The venue broke ground in July 1986, with structural engineering handled by Geiger Associates, and Cowper Construction Management serving as general contractor. It was originally built with a seating capacity of 19,500, which at the time made it the third-largest stadium in Minor League Baseball. This included a club level with seating for 3,500 and 38 luxury suites, general admission bleacher seating for 1,130 in right field, and a 250-seat restaurant with city and field views on the mezzanine level. Rich Products already owned and operated local restaurants under their B.R. Guest brand, and they assumed operation of the venue&#x27;s restaurant and concessions.

The $42.4 million venue was mainly paid for with public funding. $22.5 million came from New York State, $12.9 million came from the City of Buffalo, $4.2 million came from Erie County, and $2.8 million came from the Buffalo Bisons. The New York State funding was contingent on the Bisons signing a 20-year lease with the City of Buffalo for use of the venue, which they did just prior to groundbreaking. The City of Buffalo and Erie County paid an additional $14 million for the construction of parking garages to service the venue and other downtown businesses.

A planned second phase of construction was a seating expansion contingent on Buffalo acquiring a Major League Baseball franchise. The original design by HOK Sport called for a third deck to be added in place of the roof, expanding the venue&#x27;s capacity from 19,500 to 40,000. In May 1987, it was estimated this expansion could be completed within one offseason at a cost of $15 million.

===Opening and reception, 1988–1989===
Opening Day of the venue&#x27;s inaugural season took place on April 14, 1988, and saw the Buffalo Bisons defeat the Denver Zephyrs 1–0. Bob Patterson of the Bisons threw the first pitch against Billy Bates, and the lone score came from a Tom Prince home run. Pam Postema, the first female umpire in the history of professional baseball, officiated the game. Prior to the event, The Oak Ridge Boys performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and both Mayor James D. Griffin and Governor Mario Cuomo threw ceremonial first pitches.

The formal dedication of the venue took place on May 21, 1988, prior to the Buffalo Bisons defeating the Syracuse Chiefs in an interleague Triple-A Alliance game by a score of 6–5. Larry King threw the ceremonial first pitch and sat in on commentary with WBEN broadcasters Pete Weber and John Murphy.

In their first year at the venue after moving from War Memorial Stadium, the Buffalo Bisons broke the all-time record for Minor League Baseball attendance by drawing 1,186,651 fans during the 1988 season. The team had capped season ticket sales at 9,000 seats to ensure that individual game tickets would be available.

The inaugural Build New York Award was given to Cowper Construction Management by the General Building Contractors of New York State for their work on the venue.

The venue was lauded by mainstream media outlets, including feature stories by &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;. Eric Brazil wrote in his &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; column that the venue, &quot;just may be baseball&#x27;s prototype for the 1990s and beyond&quot;.

Pete McMartin wrote fondly of the venue in his June 1989 article for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, contrasting it with the recently opened SkyDome in Toronto:

===MLB preparation and seating expansion, 1990–1995===
In anticipation of Buffalo being awarded a major league franchise, Robert E. Rich Jr. began establishing minor league farm teams for the Buffalo Bisons organization. Rich Jr. acquired the Double-A Wichita Pilots and founded the Class A Short Season Niagara Falls Rapids. He renamed Wichita&#x27;s team to the Wranglers and planned to upgrade their franchise to Triple-A upon the Bisons joining Major League Baseball.

The proposed seating expansion to accommodate Major League Baseball was revised by HOK Sport to preserve the aesthetic of the roof, which would now be kept and raised to cover a third deck. In this new design, less seating would be built on the third deck, and instead a new right field seating structure would be built in front of the Exchange Street parking ramp. In addition, expanded bleachers would be added in right field that could later be converted to permanent seating. Capacity after this expansion would increase from 19,500 to 41,530 at a cost of $30 million, but unlike the earlier design would take longer than a single offseason to complete. Prior to the 1990 season, 1,400 bleacher seats and a standing-room only area within the third-base mezzanine were added at a cost of $1.34 million, increasing the stadium&#x27;s capacity from 19,500 to 21,050.

In September 1990, Bob Rich Jr. attempted to buy the Montreal Expos for $100 million and move the team to Buffalo, but owner Charles Bronfman declined his offer. That same month, Rich Jr. and his investment group presented their bid for a Buffalo expansion franchise to the National League Expansion Committee. Members of this investment group included Jeremy Jacobs, Larry King, Northrup R. Knox, Robert G. Wilmers, Robert O. Swados and Seymour H. Knox III. It was reported that the investment group was prepared to fund $134 million in private capital required for expansion, which included the $95 million franchise fee and initial operating costs. The largest share of the financial burden would fall on Rich Jr., who pledged a minimum of $10 million cash and the equity in his three minor league teams. Rich Jr. publicly voiced concerns in December 1990 that without a salary cap and revenue sharing, he would have to raise ticket prices to unaffordable levels while being unable to produce a competitive on-field product. 27,000 major league season ticket commitments were made by April 1991, consisting of 18,000 paid seat deposits and 9,000 complimentary deposits awarded to the existing Bisons season ticket holders. Buffalo was one of six finalists for the 1993 Major League Baseball expansion, but franchises were awarded to the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins in June 1991. National League president Bill White later confirmed that Rich Jr. publicly questioning the league&#x27;s financial structure sunk his bid.

In their fourth year at the stadium, the Buffalo Bisons once again broke the all-time record for Minor League Baseball attendance by drawing 1,240,951 fans during the 1991 season.

Rich Jr. offered to let the Montreal Expos finish their home schedule at the venue in September 1991 after Olympic Stadium was damaged, but the team instead played their final 13 home games on the road.

In June 1992, Rich Jr. attempted to buy the San Francisco Giants and move the team to Buffalo, but owner Bob Lurie declined his offer. The proposed name for the team would have been the New York Giants of Buffalo, as the franchise had previously played as the New York Giants from 1885 to 1957 in New York City. That same month, the City of Buffalo chose to exercise an escape clause and buy back $24.2 million in federal bonds they had earmarked for expanding the venue to accommodate Major League Baseball.

The 1988 to 1993 Buffalo Bisons seasons were the six highest-attended campaigns in Minor League Baseball history, with each season drawing over 1,000,000 fans.

Prior to the 1994 season, a restaurant called Power Alley Pub was constructed under the bleachers in right-center field. The restaurant provided seating with views of the field through the outfield wall.

Rich Jr. moved his Class A Short Season Niagara Falls Rapids after he was unable to secure repairs for the aging Sal Maglie Stadium. The team resumed play as the Jamestown Jammers in June 1994.

In July 1994, Rich Jr. notified the Major League Baseball Expansion Committee that he was interested in pursuing a Buffalo expansion franchise. However, he would retract this notification the following month after the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike commenced. Buffalo was withdrawn as a candidate for the 1998 Major League Baseball expansion, and franchises were awarded to the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays in March 1995.

Rich Jr. was offered an expansion franchise by the United Baseball League of Major League Baseball in November 1994 at a cost of $5 million, which would have played at the venue beginning with the 1996 season. However, franchises were awarded in February 1995 to Long Island, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Juan, Vancouver and Washington before the league folded without ever playing a game.

The Buffalo Bisons considered sharing the venue with the Toronto Blue Jays for their 1995 season, as the Ontario Labour Relations Board prohibited non-union replacement players from competing at SkyDome during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. The Blue Jays instead chose to play at their spring training home of Dunedin Stadium, but the strike ended in April 1995 and the team returned to SkyDome.

===Alterations and seating reduction, 1996–2019===
A new outfield fence was erected prior to the 1996 season at a cost of $50,000 so that the venue&#x27;s playing surface mirrored the dimensions of Jacobs Field. Left-center field was reduced from 384 feet to 371 feet, center field was reduced from 410 feet to 404 feet, right-center field was reduced from 384 feet to 367 feet, and the height of the center field fence was reduced from 15 feet to 8 feet. This change allowed the Cleveland Indians, Buffalo&#x27;s major league affiliate, to better evaluate their prospects, while also making the park more hitter-friendly.

The venue was home to the Buffalo Nighthawks of the Ladies Professional Baseball League before the league shut down mid-season in July 1998. The Nighthawks were in first place with an 11–5 record when the league folded, and were declared Eastern Division champions.

The park&#x27;s original four-color dot matrix scoreboard in center field was retrofitted with a 38-foot wide by 19-foot tall Daktronics LED video screen in 1999 at a cost of $1.2 million.

The venue was home to the Buffalo Bulls of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2000. The Bulls finished the season with a 12–35 record and moved to Amherst Audubon Field the following year.

Major League Lacrosse staged an exhibition at the venue on August 11, 2000, as part of their Summer Showcase Tour. Robert E. Rich Jr. planned to purchase a Major League Lacrosse franchise at a cost of $1 million to begin play at the venue in June 2001. However, he withdrew support after determining that removing and replacing the pitcher&#x27;s mound for lacrosse games would damage the field and put the Buffalo Bisons at a disadvantage.

The 20-year lease between the Buffalo Bisons and City of Buffalo for use of the venue was renegotiated in January 2003, with the addition of funding from Erie County.

Prior to the 2004 season, $5 million in renovations to the venue were completed, including removal of the stadium&#x27;s right field bleachers and construction of a four-tier Party Deck in its place. The removal of the bleachers decreased the stadium capacity from 21,050 to 18,025.

A 4-foot wide by 8-foot tall digital billboard was installed on the corner of Washington Street and Swan Street before the 2007 season at a cost of $70,000.

The 20-year lease between the Buffalo Bisons and City of Buffalo for use of the venue expired following the 2008 season, and the city began offering year-to-year leases to the team thereafter.

The venue&#x27;s luxury suites were consolidated and renovated beginning in 2010, reducing the total number from 38 to 26. A conference suite was constructed on the first-base side of the stadium at a cost of $250,000, and the year-round suite can accommodate business gatherings of up to 40 people.

Prior to the 2011 season, the park&#x27;s original scoreboard in center field was removed and replaced by an 80-foot wide by 33-foot tall Daktronics high-definition LED video screen at a cost $2.5 million. That same year, a new $970,000 field drainage system and a new $750,000 field lighting system were added to the venue.

The venue was one of six that played home to the Empire State Yankees of the International League in 2012. The team was forced to play at alternate sites that season as PNC Field was undergoing renovations. The Yankees finished the season with a 84–60 record and advanced to the International League playoffs.

$500,000 was spent in improvements to the venue before the 2014 season, including a new sound system and the installation of new LED message boards down both baselines.

A campaign to replace the park&#x27;s original red seating with wider green seating began in 2014. The stadium&#x27;s capacity was reduced from 18,025 to 17,600 when 3,700 seats were replaced prior to the 2015 season at a cost of $758,000. 2,900 seats were replaced prior to the 2017 season, reducing capacity of the venue from 17,600 to 16,907. 2,000 seats were replaced prior to the 2019 season, reducing capacity of the venue from 16,907 to 16,600.

Following the 2019 season, protective crowd netting was installed throughout the venue at a cost of $475,000 to meet Major League Baseball safety standards.

===MLB residency and renovation, 2020–2021===
In June 2020, the Buffalo Bisons canceled their season at the venue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Toronto Blue Jays, the Bisons&#x27; major league affiliate, announced the following month that they would play their 2020 season at the venue after the government of Canada denied them permission to play at Rogers Centre. The venue&#x27;s first Major League Baseball game took place on August 11, 2020, in which the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Miami Marlins 5–4 in extra innings. The Blue Jays finished the season with a 32–28 record, and advanced to the American League Wild Card Series.

Major League Baseball and the Blue Jays organization jointly funded renovations of the venue prior to the 2020 season at a cost of $5 million. Permanent upgrades included installation of LED field lighting, installation of instant replay technology, installation of Hawk-Eye for Statcast tracking, a resurfaced infield, and relocation of the home dugout to the third-base side of the stadium. Temporary facilities designed for the postponed MLB at Field of Dreams game were also utilized.

The Blue Jays used the venue for part of their 2021 season due to the ongoing pandemic, after having started the season at TD Ballpark. The Bisons accommodated this residency by temporarily relocating to Trenton Thunder Ballpark in Trenton, New Jersey. The venue drew higher attendance for MLB home games than the Miami Marlins, Oakland A&#x27;s and Tampa Bay Rays drew at their own home venues. The Blue Jays played 49 Major League Baseball games at the venue over the course of two seasons, tying Hiram Bithorn Stadium for the all-time record of most regular season games hosted by a non-home ballpark.

The Bisons and Blue Jays jointly funded additional renovations of the venue prior to the 2021 season. These permanent upgrades included the installation of new light standards, new batting cages, new foul poles, a resurfaced outfield, and the relocation of both bullpens from foul territory to right-center field. The renovated venue was named Professional Baseball Field of the Year in November 2021 by Sports Turf Managers Association. The renovations were also nominated for Project of the Year at the 2021 Stadium Business Awards.

===Fire and proposed renovations, 2023–present===

In September 2023, the venue sustained $600,000 in damage after a fire started in a mobile concession stand. 

The Buffalo Bisons hired a lobbying firm in November 2023 to seek funding from New York State for renovations that would improve the fan experience.

===Naming rights===
Pilot Air Freight of Philadelphia purchased the 20-year naming rights to the venue in 1986. The stadium would be named Pilot Field in exchange for the company paying the City of Buffalo $51,000 on an annual basis. Their name was stripped from the venue by the City of Buffalo in March 1995 after Pilot Air Freight defaulted on payments.

The stadium was then known as Downtown Ballpark until July 1995, when local HMO North AmeriCare purchased the naming rights and the stadium became North AmeriCare Park (colloquially known as The NAP). North AmeriCare agreed to pay the City of Buffalo $3.3 million over the course of 13 years. The Dunn Tire chain of tire outlets assumed North AmeriCare&#x27;s remaining contract with the City of Buffalo in May 1999, and the venue became Dunn Tire Park.

Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Buffalo purchased the 10-year naming rights to the stadium in December 2008, and it was renamed Coca-Cola Field beginning with the 2009 season. Sahlen&#x27;s purchased the 10-year naming rights to the stadium in October 2018, and it was renamed Sahlen Field beginning with the 2019 season.

==Special features==

===Dimensions===

The venue&#x27;s play is greatly affected by its orientation and susceptibility to the winds of nearby Lake Erie. Center field faces south-southeast, with a year-round 8 to 10 MPH breeze moving from the right field foul pole towards the left field foul pole. Right-handed batters therefore tend to have the most success hitting balls into left field and left-center, although left-handed batters hitting opposite field at a high trajectory also see their balls carried out of the park. The cozy field dimensions of 325 feet to left field and 371 feet to left-center aid the number of home runs hit in those directions. A 60-foot tall chain-link fence in left field protects motor vehicles on Oak Street from being struck. Cold winds in early months of the baseball season tend to prevent balls from exiting the park, while the warmer summer winds allow for greater carry. In 2019, &quot;Baseball America&quot; ranked it as the third-best International League ballpark to hit home runs in. The venue allowed 10% more runs than average during the 2020 Toronto Blue Jays season.

===Ground rules===
# A fair ball becoming lodged in the outfield fence padding is a ground rule double.
# A bounding fair ball striking the outfield fence padding and bouncing over the fence is an automatic double.
# A fair ball striking the foul pole caps or metal support piping beyond the outfield wall:
## is a home run if hit as a fly ball.
## is out of play if hit as a bounding ball.
# A bounding fair ball striking the unpadded cement wall to the immediate right and left of each foul pole is in play.
# A fair ball striking the bottom of the outfield fence is in play.

===Concessions===
Pub at the Park is a 250-seat bar and restaurant located within the venue&#x27;s first-base mezzanine that features both indoor seating and outdoor patio seating with views of the field. It is open to the public for special events via an entrance on Washington Street, and exclusively to ticketholders with reservations on game days. The restaurant was formerly known as Pettibone&#x27;s Grille from 1988 to 2016.

Concessions around the venue&#x27;s concourse highlight local cuisine, with selections including beef on weck from Charlie the Butcher, craft beer from Consumer&#x27;s Beverages and Resurgence Brewing Company, craft beer and wine from Southern Tier Brewing Company, hot dogs from Sahlen&#x27;s, pierogies from Alexandra Foods, pizza from La Nova Pizzeria, pizza logs from Original Pizza Logs, and soft serve from Upstate Farms. Coca-Cola brand soft drinks are also available throughout the stadium.

The venue is cashless for concessions, with support for contactless payment and online food ordering with mobile payment.

===Tributes===
The Buffalo Bisons have customarily marked the landing spot of every home run their players have hit into the right field parking lot since the venue&#x27;s inaugural season in 1988. This feat is rarely accomplished because the balls have had to clear either the right field bleachers or the Party Deck that replaced them in order to reach the parking lot. Russell Branyan holds the record for most parking lot home runs, with three.

Robert E. Rich Sr., the founder of Rich Products and father of Buffalo Bisons owner Robert E. Rich Jr., died in February 2006. His initials are inscribed on the press box, above the owner&#x27;s suite, in tribute. The venue hosted the annual Robert E. Rich Memorial Baseball Classic tournament between local high school teams from 2006 to 2008.

Former Mayor of Buffalo James D. Griffin was posthumously honored by the Buffalo Common Council in July 2008 after they voted to change the venue&#x27;s address to One James D. Griffin Plaza.

A bronze sculpture of James D. Griffin titled &quot;The First Pitch&quot;, referencing his ceremonial first pitch at the venue&#x27;s inaugural game, was unveiled outside the stadium in August 2012. The William Koch piece was commissioned by the Buffalo Bisons to honor Griffin&#x27;s contributions in constructing the ballpark and bringing professional baseball back to Buffalo.

Plaques honoring all members of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame were previously displayed within the Hall of Fame and Heritage Room, which was built on the venue&#x27;s third-base concourse in 2013. It was removed in 2021 as part of stadium renovations, and has yet to reopen.

The Buffalo Bisons hang a Championship Corner banner in left field that commemorates the team&#x27;s many league and division championships, along with the retired numbers of Ollie Carnegie (6), Luke Easter (25), Jeff Manto (30) and Jackie Robinson (42).

Retired numbers of former Toronto Blue Jays players Roberto Alomar (12) and Roy Halladay (32), along with the retired number of Jackie Robinson (42), were inscribed above the venue&#x27;s press box for the 2020 season. In addition, the number of former Toronto Blue Jays player Tony Fernández (1) was inscribed on the venue&#x27;s outfield fence to honor his recent passing.

==Transportation access==
Sahlen Field is located at the Elm Street exit (Exit 6) of Interstate 190, and within one mile of both the Oak Street exit of Route 33 and the Seneca Street exit of Route 5.

A 816-space Allpro parking ramp is located behind right field on Exchange Street, and a pedestrian bridge over Washington Street connects it with a 457-space Allpro parking garage under the Seneca One Tower complex. The Allpro parking garage provides a charging station.

The venue is publicly served by Seneca Station of Buffalo Metro Rail, located one block West of the venue on Main Street. It is also served by Buffalo–Exchange Street station of Amtrak, located directly across from the venue on Exchange Street.

Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority maintains the Washington &amp; Seneca bus stop located directly outside the venue&#x27;s Seneca Street entrance, providing local service on Route 8 between downtown Buffalo and University Station.

<text>Adventure Construction Set (ACS) is a game creation system written by Stuart Smith that is used to construct tile-based graphical adventure games. &quot;ACS&quot; was published by Electronic Arts in 1984 for the Commodore 64, then for the Apple II, Amiga, and MS-DOS. Smith previously developed several commercial adventure games of a similar style, such as &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; (1981).

&quot;ACS&quot; provides a graphical editor for the construction of maps, placement of creatures and items, and menu-based scripting to control game logic. A constructed game is stored on its own disk which can be copied and shared with friends; games exported from the Amiga version still require ACS to play. A complete game is included: &quot;Rivers of Light&quot;, based on the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. The Amiga version has an additional pre-made adventure called &quot;Galactic Agent&quot; by Ken St. Andre.

Todd Howard revealed that when Bethesda started making &quot;Morrowind&quot;, he was excited about making a tool like Stuart Smith&#x27;s &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot; for the Apple II.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay features of &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot; include:
* Turn-based system.
* Up to four players may play.
* A player character can be imported from another adventure, but the character might not retain the same graphic tile if the new adventure uses a different tile set.
* Music and sound.
* Random encounters.
* Spells.
* Range and melee combat.
* Along with graphic tiles, text screens are also available for conveying information.
* Creatures which behave as player-mimics, copying various traits and equipment of the player.
* Shops.

==Construction system==
&quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot; was designed to make tile-based graphical adventure games similar to author Stuart Smith&#x27;s earlier games &quot;The Return of Heracles&quot; and &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;.

The framework of an adventure built within &quot;ACS&quot; is organized into the following main categories:
* &quot;World map&quot;: This is the top-level map from which characters begin their adventure. The world map differs from other playable areas of the game in that it has no fixed creature encounters, no stacked tiles, quicker movement, it is scrollable, and it optionally may wrap around (have no borders). Random encounters may occur on the world map, during which the game switches to a special view similar to a &quot;room&quot; to handle the encounter.
* &quot;Regions&quot;: A region is a collection of rooms. A region is a construction concept and does not present itself to the player, except by indirect means such as disk access when traveling between regions.
* &quot;Rooms&quot;: A room is a rectangular, tiled area of a size which must fit within the game&#x27;s viewport. Tiles may be used to make a room look like shapes other than rectangular.
* &quot;Things&quot;: A thing is a background tile, obstacle, or collectible item.
* &quot;Creatures&quot;
* &quot;Pictures&quot;: These are art assets used by the tiles. For some platforms, four colors are available for images. For the Amiga platform, 32 colors are available, each of which can be assigned to be any of 4096 available colors.

Tiles may be stacked. Only the top tile of a stack may be directly interacted with by the player, but special tiles allow for game-logic to be implemented via the stack. For example, a tile may be set to &quot;Activate All Things at This Place&quot;. Tiles may also allow or disallow interaction based on the contents of the player&#x27;s inventory, or activate if a specific object is dropped on top of the stack.

Spell-effects may be attached to Things.

The game allows for somewhat varied monster AI behavior. A creature may be specified to behave solely as a &quot;fighter&quot; or &quot;slinker&quot;, or adjust its temperament based on its condition. In addition, it may be specified as either an &quot;enemy&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, or &quot;thief&quot;, with a total of 8 possible behavioral patterns expressed.

There are maximum quotas applied to most categories in the game (including the total number of unique things, text messages, pictures, regions, creatures per region, things per region, and rooms per region). These limits restrict the size of adventures. For example, each adventure can contain up to 15 regions and each region can contain up to 16 rooms.

&quot;ACS&quot; included a framework for fantasy adventures, as well as starter toolkits for fantasy, futurist, and &quot;spy&quot; game genres.

===Auto-Construct Feature===
Along with user-constructed adventures, the software can also auto-construct a random adventure. This feature can optionally be used to auto-complete a partially built adventure. The user may specify numerous parameters for auto-generation, including difficulty level.

==Development==

Stuart stated that the concept was based on his experience writing accounting software, during which he developed a report generator that would create a standalone COBOL program, and that Electronic Arts suggested the name &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot;. &quot;ACS&quot; was produced by Don Daglow in parallel with the development of &quot;Racing Destruction Set&quot;.

==Release==
Shortly after &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot;″s release, announcements were included in the packaging for players to submit their adventures for a contest to be judged by Electronic Arts and their playtesters. Approximately 50 games were submitted and winners chosen for three categories:

* Fantasy: &quot;Festival&quot; by R.C. Purrenhage
* Science fiction: &quot;Cosmos&quot; by Albert Jerng 
* Contemporary: &quot;Panama&quot; by Will Bryant and &quot;Codename: Viper&quot; by Peter Schroeder

The supplementary manual included with the Amiga port mentions, &quot;If you&#x27;re an &quot;ACS&quot; fanatic you can join the &quot;Adventure Construction Set Club&quot;. Club members receive access to a library of adventures created with &quot;ACS&quot;&quot;. The supplementary manual also mentions that the club is not affiliated with Electronic Arts.

==Reception==
Orson Scott Card criticized &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot;″s user interface, stating that it &quot;was designed by the Kludge Monster from the Nethermost Hell&quot;. He praised the game&#x27;s flexibility, however, reporting that his son was able to create a spell called &quot;Summon Duck&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Scorpia described &quot;ACS&quot; as an &quot;easy-to-use, albeit time-consuming, means of creating a graphic adventure&quot;.

<text>Merian Caldwell Cooper (October 24, 1893 – April 21, 1973) was an American filmmaker, actor, producer and air officer. In film, his most famous work was the 1933 movie &quot;King Kong&quot;, and he is credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama film projection process. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

Before entering the movie business, Cooper fought in the World War I as a pilot in the United States Army Air Service and later in the Polish Air Force. He had a distinguished career as the founder of the Kościuszko Squadron during the Polish–Soviet War and was a Soviet prisoner of war for a time. He got his start in film as part of the Explorers Club, traveling the world and documenting adventures. He was a member of the board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film took priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1925, he and Ernest B. Schoedsack went to Iran and made &quot;Grass: A Nation&#x27;s Battle for Life&quot;, a documentary about the Bakhtiari people.

==Early life==
Merian Caldwell Cooper was born in Jacksonville, Florida, to lawyer John C. Cooper and Mary Caldwell. He was the youngest of three children. At age six, Cooper decided that he wanted to be an explorer after hearing stories from the book &quot;Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa&quot;. He was educated at The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and graduated in 1911.

After graduation, Cooper received a prestigious appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was expelled during his senior year for &quot;hell raising and for championing air power&quot;. In 1916, Cooper worked for the &quot;Minneapolis Daily News&quot; as a reporter, where he met Delos Lovelace. In the next few years, he also worked at the &quot;Des Moines Register-Leader&quot; and the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;.

==Early military service==
===Georgia National Guard===
In 1916, Cooper joined the Georgia National Guard to help chase Pancho Villa in Mexico. He was called home in March 1917. He worked for the &quot;El Paso Herald&quot; on a 30-day leave of absence. After returning to his service, Cooper was appointed lieutenant; however, he refused the appointment hoping to participate in combat. Instead, he went to the Military Aeronautics School in Atlanta to learn to fly. Cooper graduated at the top of his class.

===World War I===
In October 1917, six months after the American entry into World War I, Cooper went to France with the 201st Squadron. He attended flying school in Issoudun. While flying with his friend, Cooper hit his head and was knocked out during a 200-foot plunge. After the incident, Cooper suffered from shock and had to relearn how to fly. Cooper requested to go to Clermont-Ferrand to be trained as a bomber pilot. He became a pilot with the 20th Aero Squadron (which later became the 1st Day Bombardment Group).

Cooper served as a DH-4 bomber pilot with the United States Army Air Service during World War I. On September 26, 1918, his plane was shot down. The plane caught fire, and Cooper spun the plane to suck the flames out. Cooper survived, although he suffered burns, injured his hands, and was presumed dead. German soldiers saw his plane landing and took him to a prisoner reserve hospital. The death certificate on this page was sent to Cooper&#x27;s family. The Army had believed him killed but he was captured by the Germans and taken as a Prisoner of war (POW). Cooper&#x27;s father received a letter from Merian around the time the death certificate arrived. Merian C. Cooper sent the copy back to the Army with the notation on top &quot;In the language of Mark Twain Your death has been greatly exaggerated.&quot;

Captain Cooper remained in the Air Service after the war; he helped with Herbert Hoover&#x27;s U.S. Food Administration that provided aid to Poland. He later became the chief of the Poland division.

===Kościuszko Squadron===
From late 1919 until the 1921 Treaty of Riga, Cooper was a member of a volunteer American flight squadron, the Kościuszko Squadron, which supported the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War. On July 13, 1920, his plane was shot down, and he spent nearly nine months in a Soviet prisoner of war camp where the writer Isaac Babel interviewed him. He escaped just before the war was over and made it to Latvia. For his valor he was decorated by Polish commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski with the highest Polish military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.
During his time as a POW, Cooper wrote an autobiography: &quot;Things Men Die For&quot;. The manuscript was published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in New York (the Knickerbocker Press) in 1927. However, in 1928, Cooper regretted releasing certain details about &quot;Nina&quot; (probably Małgorzata Słomczyńska) with whom he had relations outside of wedlock. Cooper asked Dagmar Matson, who had the manuscript, to buy all the copies of the book possible. Matson found almost all 5,000 copies that had been printed. The books were destroyed, while Cooper and Matson each kept a copy.

An interbellum Polish film directed by Leonard Buczkowski, &quot;Gwiaździsta eskadra&quot; (The Starry Squadron), was inspired by Cooper&#x27;s experiences as a Polish Air Force officer. The film was made with the cooperation of the Polish army and was the most expensive Polish film prior to World War II. After World War II, all copies of the film found in Poland were destroyed by the Soviets.

==Career==
===Cooper and Schoedsack===

After returning from overseas in 1921, Cooper got a job working the night shift at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was commissioned to write articles for &quot;Asia&quot; magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the &quot;Wisdom II&quot;. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for &quot;Asia&quot; was published in 1923.

After returning home, Cooper researched for the American Geographical Society. In 1924, Cooper joined Schoedsack and Marguerite Harrison who had embarked on an expedition that would be turned into the film &quot;Grass&quot; (1925). They returned later the same year. Cooper became a member of the Explorers Club of New York in January 1925 and was asked to give lectures and attend events due to his extensive traveling. &quot;Grass&quot; was acquired by Paramount Pictures. Cooper and Schoedsack&#x27;s first film gained the attention of Jesse Lasky, who commissioned the duo for their second film, &quot;Chang&quot; (1927). They also produced the film &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, which was filmed among the fighting tribes of the Sudan. These films combined real footage with staged sequences.

===Pan American Airways===
From 1926 to 1927, Cooper discussed with John Hambleton the plans for Pan American Airways, which was formed in 1927. Cooper was a member of the board of directors of Pan American Airways. During his tenure at Pan Am, the company established the first regularly scheduled transatlantic service. While he was on the board, Cooper did not devote his full attention to the organization; he took time in 1929 and 1930 to work on the script for &quot;King Kong&quot;. By 1931, he was back in Hollywood. He resigned from the board of directors in 1935, following health complications.

===&quot;King Kong&quot;===
Cooper said that he thought of &quot;King Kong&quot; after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he awoke, he recorded the idea and used it for the film. He was going to have a giant gorilla fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.
Cooper needed a production studio for the film, but recognized the great cost of the movie, especially during the Great Depression. Cooper helped David Selznick get a job at RKO Pictures, which was struggling financially. Selznick became the vice president of RKO and asked Cooper to join him in September 1931, although he had only produced three films thus far in his career. Cooper began working as an executive assistant at age thirty-eight. He officially pitched the idea for &quot;King Kong&quot; in December 1931. Shortly after, he began to seek actors and build full-scale sets, although the screenplay was not yet complete.

The screenplay was delivered to Cooper in January 1932. Schoedsack contributed to the film, focusing on shooting scenes for the boat sequences and in native villages, leaving Cooper to shoot the jungle scenes. In February 1933, the title for the film was registered for copyright. Throughout filming there were creative battles. Critics at RKO argued that the film should begin with Kong. Cooper believed that a film should begin with a &quot;slow dramatic buildup that would establish everything from characters to mood ...&quot; so that the action of the film could &quot;naturally, relentlessly, roll on out of its own creative movement&quot;, and thus chose not to begin the film with a shot of Kong. The iconic scene in which Kong is atop of the Empire State Building was almost canceled by Cooper for legal reasons, but was kept in the film because RKO bought the rights to &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

Overlapping with the production of &quot;King Kong&quot; was the making of &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, which began in May 1932. Cooper once again worked with Schoedsack to produce the film.

In the 1933 version of &quot;King Kong&quot;, Cooper and co-director Ernest B. Schoedsack appear at the end, piloting the plane that finally finishes off Kong. Cooper had reportedly said, &quot;We should kill the sonofabitch ourselves.&quot; Cooper personally cut a scene in &quot;King Kong&quot; in which four sailors are shaken off a tree trunk bridge by Kong, fall into a ravine, and are eaten alive by giant spiders. According to Hollywood folklore, the decision was made after previews in January 1933, during which audience members either fled the theater in terror or talked about the ghastly scene throughout the remainder of the movie. However, more objective sources maintain that the scene merely slowed the film&#x27;s pace. Despite the rumor that Cooper kept a print of the cut footage as a memento, it has never been found. In 2021, film historian Ray Morton stated in an interview that, after looking through the films shooting schedule, he found no evidence the sequence was ever filmed. In 1963, Cooper argued unsuccessfully that he should own the rights to &quot;King Kong&quot;; later in 1976, judges ruled that Cooper&#x27;s estate owned the rights to King Kong outside the movie and its sequel. Selznick left RKO before the release of &quot;King Kong&quot;, and Cooper served as production chief from 1933 to 1934 with Pan Berman as his executive assistant.

In the 2005 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, upon learning that Fay Wray was not available because she was making a film at RKO, Carl Denham (Jack Black) replies, &quot;Cooper, huh? I might have known.&quot;

===Pioneer Pictures, Selznick International Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
Cooper helped the Whitney cousins form Pioneer Pictures in 1933, while he was still working for RKO. He was named vice president in charge of production for Pioneer Pictures in 1934. He would use Pioneer Pictures to test his technicolor innovations. The company contracted with RKO in order to fulfill Cooper&#x27;s obligations to the company, including &quot;She&quot; and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. Cooper later referred to &quot;She&quot; as the &quot;worst picture I ever made.&quot;

After these disappointments, Pioneer Pictures released a short film in three-strip technicolor called &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, which was well-received. The film won an Academy Award in 1934. Pioneer released the first full-length technicolor film, &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; in 1935. Cooper helped to advocate and pave the way for the ground-breaking technology of technicolor, as well as the widescreen process called Cinerama.

Selznick formed Selznick International Pictures in 1935, and Pioneer Pictures merged with it in June 1936. Cooper became the vice president of Selznick International Pictures that same year. Cooper did not stay long; he resigned in 1937 due to disagreements over the film &quot;Stagecoach&quot;.

After resigning from Selznick International, Cooper went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in June 1937. A noteworthy project that Cooper was involved in was the fantasy film &quot;War Eagles&quot;. The film, which would have used extensive special effects, was abandoned in approximately 1939 and never finished. Cooper was to return to the Army Air Force.

===World War II===
Cooper re-enlisted and was commissioned a colonel in the U.S. Army Air Forces. He served with Col. Robert L. Scott in India. He worked as logistics liaison for the Doolittle Raid. Thereafter, Cooper and Scott worked with Col. Caleb V. Haynes at Dinjan Airfield. They all were involved in establishing the Assam-Burma-China Ferrying Command. This marked the beginnings of The Hump Airlift.

Colonel Cooper later served in China as chief of staff for General Claire Chennault of the China Air Task Force, which was the precursor of the Fourteenth Air Force. On October 25, 1942, a CATF raid consisting of 12 B-25s and 7 P-40s, led by Colonel Cooper, successfully bombed the Kowloon Docks at Hong Kong.

He served from 1943 to 1945 in the Southwest Pacific as chief of staff for the Fifth Air Force&#x27;s Bomber Command. At the end of the war, he was promoted to brigadier general. For his contributions, he was also aboard the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; to witness Japan&#x27;s surrender.

===Argosy Pictures and Cinerama===
Cooper and his friend and frequent collaborator, noted director John Ford, formed Argosy Productions in 1946 and produced such notable films as &quot;Wagon Master&quot; (1950), Ford&#x27;s &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948), and &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949). Cooper&#x27;s films at Argosy reflected his patriotism and his vision of the United States.

Argosy negotiated a contract with RKO in 1946 to make four pictures. Cooper was able to make &quot;Grass&quot; a complete picture. Cooper also produced and directed &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;, which recruited Schoedsack as director. Cooper visited the set of the film every day to check on progress.

Cooper left Argosy Pictures to pursue the process of Cinerama. He became the vice president of Cinerama Productions in the 1950s and was also elected a board member. After failing to convince other board members to finance skilled technicians, Cooper left Cinerama with Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney to form C. V. Whitney Productions. Cooper continued to outline movies to be shot in Cinerama, but C. V. Whitney Productions only produced a few films. Cooper was the executive producer for Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956).

==Awards==
For his military service in Poland, Cooper was awarded the Silver Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari (presented by Piłsudski), and Poland&#x27;s Cross of Valour.

In 1927, Cooper was one of 19 prominent Americans who were given the title of &quot;Honorary Scouts&quot; by the Boy Scouts of America for &quot;... achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure ... of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys&quot;. The other honorees were Roy Chapman Andrews, Robert Bartlett, Frederick Russell Burnham, Richard E. Byrd, George Kruck Cherrie, James L. Clark, Lincoln Ellsworth, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, George Bird Grinnell, Charles Lindbergh, Donald Baxter MacMillan, Clifford H. Pope, George Palmer Putnam, Kermit Roosevelt, Carl Rungius, Stewart Edward White, and Orville Wright.

In 1949, &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which was presented to Willis O&#x27;Brien, the man responsible for the film&#x27;s special effects.

Cooper was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952. His film &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was nominated for Best Picture that year, but lost to Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. Cooper has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, though his first name is misspelled &quot;Meriam&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cooper was the father of Polish translator and writer Maciej Słomczyński. He married film actress Dorothy Jordan on May 27, 1933. They kept their marriage a secret from Hollywood for a month before it was reported by journalists. He suffered a heart attack later that year. In the 1950s, he supported Joseph McCarthy in his crusade to root out Communists in Hollywood and Washington, D.C.

Cooper supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

Cooper founded Advanced Projects in his later life and served as the chairman of the board. He wanted to explore new technologies like 3-D color television productions. Cooper died of cancer on April 21, 1973, in San Diego. His ashes were scattered at sea with full military honors.

<text>The Catholic Church in Taiwan is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Church operates two universities, the Fu Jen Catholic University, and Providence University.

==Demography==
According to the 2005 census, Christianity in Taiwan constituted 3.9% of the population; this included approximately 300,000 Catholics.

Estimates in 2020 suggested that the portion had risen to 4% or 6%, with Catholics making up 1% of the country&#x27;s population. In the same year there were over 600 priests and 1,000 nuns serving in 424 parishes.

==History==
In 1514, Taiwan was included in the Diocese of Funchal as a missionary jurisdiction; there was some organized Catholic activity on the island. In 1576, the first Chinese diocese, the Diocese of Macau, was established in Macau, a Portuguese colony, and covered most of China as well as Taiwan. The diocese of Macau was sub-divided several times over the next few centuries. In 1626, Northern Taiwan became a Spanish colony. In 1631, Jacinto Esquivel, a Spanish Dominican friar, built a church in Northern Taiwan. In chronological order, Taiwan belonged to the Archdiocese of Manila (1627), the Apostolic Vicariate (now Archdiocese) of Nanking (1660), the Apostolic Vicariate of Fujian (now the Archdiocese of Fuzhou) (1696) and the Apostolic Vicariate (now Diocese) of Amoy (1883).

In 1913, the Apostolic Prefecture of the Island of Taiwan (then called Formosa in foreign languages) was established out of the Diocese of Amoy. It was renamed Apostolic Prefecture of Kaohsiung in 1949, when the Apostolic Prefecture of Taipei (now the Archdiocese of Taipei) was established out of its territory.

Before the end of World War II the Catholic Church had a very minor presence in Taiwan, based mainly in the south of the island and centred on Spanish Dominican priests who went there from the Philippines in the 1860s. In 1948, there were less than 10,000 Catholics on Taiwan and 15 clergy. The end of World War II and the following years saw a mass migration of religious communities from mainland China as Communist persecution began to take effect following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949. As a result, the Catholic Church has many Mandarin-speaking emigrants from the mainland.

In September 1951 the Papal Internuncio to China was expelled to Hong Kong. Since 1952, the Papal internuncio has been stationed in Taiwan (Republic of China). Also, the ROC ambassador to the Holy See has provided the only permanent diplomatic link between China and the Holy See. Attempts to move the Papal nuncio to Beijing have failed, as the Holy See has not accepted demands by the People&#x27;s Republic of China that it sever its diplomatic links with Taiwan.

Pope John XXIII created three new dioceses on Taiwan in 1959.

After the Second Vatican Council, the episcopacy on Taiwan established the Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference. 

In 1988, the Congregation for the Evangelization of the Peoples told the Taiwan episcopacy not to inquire into the Church&#x27;s mainland China affairs and to instead limit their mission to Overseas Chinese and Chinese students overseas.

In 1998, the Vatican&#x27;s Secretariat of State requested that the Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference be renamed the Chinese Regional Bishops Conference (天主教台灣地區主教團 in Chinese, meaning the Taiwan Region Catholic Bishops Conference). The name change implied a diminished status.

The current archbishop of Taipei is Thomas Chung An-Zu (鐘安住), who was appointed on 23 May 2020 to succeed John Hung Shan-chuan (洪山川), S.V.D., who retired in the same year.

On 19 February 2021, Pope Francis formally granted a decree of canonical coronation for a Marian image of Our Lady of China, currently venerated at the National Shrine of Our Lady of China in Chiayi County, Taiwan.

<text>The cavea (Latin for &quot;enclosure&quot;) are the seating sections of Greek and Roman theatres and amphitheatres. In Roman theatres, the &quot;cavea&quot; is traditionally organised in three horizontal sections, corresponding to the social class of the spectators:
* the &quot;ima cavea&quot; is the lowest part of the &quot;cavea&quot; and the one directly surrounding the arena. It was usually reserved for the upper echelons of society.
* the &quot;media cavea&quot; directly follows the &quot;ima cavea&quot; and was open to the general public, though mostly reserved for men.
* the &quot;summa cavea&quot; is the highest section and was usually open to women and children.

Similarly, the front row was called the &quot;prima cavea&quot; and the last row was called the &quot;cavea ultima&quot;. The &quot;cavea&quot; was further divided vertically into &quot;cunei&quot;. A &quot;cuneus&quot; (Latin for &quot;wedge&quot;; plural, &quot;cunei&quot;) was a wedge-shaped division separated by the &quot;scalae&quot; or stairways.

Cavea also referred to the subterranean cells in which the wild beasts were confined prior to the combats in the Roman arena.

Cavea is also the name for an experimental liquid rocket fuel, with the formal name 1,4,diaza,1,4,dimethyl,bicyclo 2,2,2, octane dinitrate which was researched as a monopropellant. The name Cavea refers to the cage-like arrangement of carbon atoms in the compound. There was a metyhlated variant of the compound with a lower freezing point that was named Cavea B. From there on the former Cavea was referred as Cavea A.

<text>Archibald MacLeish (May 7, 1892 – April 20, 1982) was an American poet and writer, who was associated with the modernist school of poetry. MacLeish studied English at Yale University and law at Harvard University. He enlisted in and saw action during the First World War and lived in Paris in the 1920s. On returning to the United States, he contributed to Henry Luce&#x27;s magazine &quot;Fortune&quot; from 1929 to 1938. For five years, MacLeish was the ninth Librarian of Congress, a post he accepted at the urging of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. From 1949 to 1962, he was Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard. He was awarded three Pulitzer Prizes for his work.

==Early years==
MacLeish was born on May 7, 1892, in Glencoe, Illinois. His father, Scottish-born Andrew MacLeish, worked as a dry-goods merchant and was a founder of the Chicago department store Carson Pirie Scott. His mother, Martha (née Hillard), was a college professor and had served as president of Rockford College. He grew up on an estate bordering Lake Michigan. He attended the Hotchkiss School from 1907 to 1911. For his college education, MacLeish went to Yale University, where he majored in English, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and was selected for the Skull and Bones society. He then enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he served as an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;.

His studies were interrupted by World War I, in which he served first as an ambulance driver and later as an artillery officer. He fought at the Second Battle of the Marne. His brother, Kenneth MacLeish, was killed in action during the war. He graduated from law school in 1919, taught law for a semester for the government department at Harvard, then worked briefly as an editor for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He next spent three years practicing law with the Boston firm Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart. MacLeish expressed his disillusion with war in his poem &quot;Memorial Rain&quot;, published in 1926.

==Years in Paris==
In 1923, MacLeish left his law firm and moved with his wife to Paris, where they joined the community of literary expatriates that included such members as Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway. They also became part of the famed coterie of Riviera hosts Gerald and Sarah Murphy, which included Hemingway, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Fernand Léger, Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, John O&#x27;Hara, Cole Porter, Dorothy Parker, and Robert Benchley. He returned to America in 1928. From 1930 to 1938, he worked as a writer and editor for Henry Luce&#x27;s &quot;Fortune&quot;, during which he also became increasingly politically active, especially with antifascist causes. By the 1930s, he considered capitalism to be &quot;symbolically dead&quot; and wrote the verse play &quot;Panic&quot; (1935) in response.

While in Paris, Harry Crosby, publisher of the Black Sun Press, offered to publish MacLeish&#x27;s poetry. Both MacLeish and Crosby had overturned the normal expectations of society, rejecting conventional careers in the legal and banking fields. Crosby published MacLeish&#x27;s long poem &quot;Einstein&quot; in a deluxe edition of 150 copies that sold quickly. MacLeish was paid $200 for his work. In 1932, MacLeish published his long poem &quot;Conquistador&quot;, which presents Cortés&#x27;s conquest of the Aztecs as symbolic of the American experience. In 1933, &quot;Conquistador&quot; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, the first of three awarded to MacLeish.

In 1934, he wrote a libretto for &quot;&quot;, a ballet by Nicolas Nabokov and Léonide Massine (Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo); it premiered in Philadelphia with great success.

In 1938, MacLeish published as a book a long poem &quot;Land of the Free&quot;, built around a series of 88 photographs of the rural depression by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and the Farm Security Administration and other agencies. The book influenced Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;.

== Librarian of Congress ==
American Libraries has called MacLeish &quot;one of the 100 most influential figures in librarianship during the 20th century&quot; in the United States. MacLeish&#x27;s career in libraries and public service began, not with an internal desire, but from a combination of the urging of a close friend, Felix Frankfurter, and as MacLeish put it, &quot;The President decided I wanted to be Librarian of Congress.&quot; Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination of MacLeish was a controversial and highly political maneuver fraught with several challenges.

MacLeish sought support from expected places such as the president of Harvard, MacLeish&#x27;s current place of work, but found none. Support from unexpected places, such as M. Llewellyn Raney of the University of Chicago libraries, alleviated the ALA letter-writing campaign against MacLeish&#x27;s nomination.&quot; The main Republican argument against MacLeish&#x27;s nomination from within Congress was that he was a poet and was a &quot;fellow traveler&quot; or sympathetic to communist causes. Calling to mind differences with the party he had over the years, MacLeish avowed, &quot;no one would be more shocked to learn I am a Communist than the Communists themselves.&quot; In Congress, MacLeish&#x27;s main advocate was Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley, Democrat from Kentucky. With President Roosevelt&#x27;s support and Senator Barkley&#x27;s skillful defense in the United States Senate, victory in a roll call vote was achieved, with 63 senators voting in favor of MacLeish&#x27;s appointment. MacLeish was sworn in as Librarian of Congress on July 10, 1939, by the local postmaster at Conway, Massachusetts.

MacLeish became privy to Roosevelt&#x27;s views on the library during a private meeting with the President. According to Roosevelt, the pay levels were too low and many people would need to be removed. Soon afterward, MacLeish joined the retiring Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam for a luncheon in New York. At the meeting, Putnam relayed his intention to continue working at the library, that he would be given the title of librarian emeritus, and that his office would be down the hall from MacLeish&#x27;s. The meeting further crystallized for MacLeish that as Librarian of Congress, he would be &quot;an unpopular newcomer, disturbing the status quo.&quot;
A question from MacLeish&#x27;s daughter, Mimi, led him to realize, &quot;Nothing is more difficult for the beginning librarian than to discover [in] what profession he was engaged.&quot; Mimi, his daughter, had inquired about what her daddy was to do all day, &quot;...hand out books?&quot; MacLeish created his own job description and set out to learn about how the library was currently organized. In October 1944, MacLeish described that he did not set out to reorganize the library, rather &quot;...one problem or another demanded action, and each problem solved led on to another that needed attention.&quot;

MacLeish&#x27;s chief accomplishments had their start in instituting daily staff meetings with division chiefs, the chief assistant librarian, and other administrators. He then set about setting up various committees on various projects, including acquisitions policy, fiscal operations, cataloging, and outreach. The committees alerted MacLeish to various problems throughout the library. Putnam was conspicuously not invited to attend these meetings, resulting in the librarian emeritus&#x27; feelings being &quot;mortally hurt&quot;, but according to MacLeish, it was necessary to exclude Putnam; otherwise, &quot;he would have been sitting there listening to talk about himself which he would take personally.&quot;

First and foremost, under Putnam, the library was acquiring more books than it could catalog. A report in December 1939, found that over one-quarter of the library&#x27;s collection had not yet been cataloged. MacLeish solved the problem of acquisitions and cataloging through establishing another committee instructed to seek advice from specialists outside of the Library of Congress. The committee found many subject areas of the library to be adequate and many other areas to be, surprisingly, inadequately provided for. A set of general principles on acquisitions was then developed to ensure that, though it was impossible to collect everything, the Library of Congress would acquire the bare minimum of canons to meet its mission. These principles included acquiring all materials necessary to members of Congress and government officers, all materials expressing and recording the life and achievements of the people of the United States, and materials of other societies past and present that are of the most immediate concern to the peoples of the United States.

Secondly, MacLeish set about reorganizing the operational structure. Leading scholars in library science were assigned a committee to analyze the library&#x27;s managerial structure. The committee issued a report a mere two months after it was formed, in April 1940, stating that a major restructuring was necessary. This was no surprise to MacLeish, who had 35 divisions under him. He divided the library&#x27;s functions into three departments: administration, processing, and reference. All existing divisions were then assigned as appropriate. By including library scientists from inside and outside the Library of Congress, MacLeish was able to gain faith from the library community that he was on the right track. Within a year, MacLeish had completely restructured the Library of Congress, making it work more efficiently and aligning the library to &quot;report on the mystery of things.&quot;

Last, but not least, MacLeish promoted the Library of Congress through various forms of public advocacy. Perhaps his greatest display of public advocacy was requesting a budget increase of over a million dollars in his March 1940 budget proposal to Congress. While the library did not receive the full increase, it received an increase of $367,591, the largest one-year increase to date. Much of the increase went toward improved pay levels, increased acquisitions in underserved subject areas, and new positions. MacLeish resigned as Librarian of Congress on December 19, 1944, to take up the post of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.

==World War II==

Archibald MacLeish also assisted with the development of the new &quot;Research and Analysis Branch&quot; of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. &quot;These operations were overseen by the distinguished Harvard University historian William L. Langer, who, with the assistance of the American Council of Learned Societies and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish, set out immediately to recruit a professional staff drawn from across the social sciences. Over the next 12 months, academic specialists from fields ranging from geography to classical philology descended upon Washington, bringing with them their most promising graduate students, and set up shop in the headquarters of the Research and Analysis (R&amp;A) Branch at Twenty-third and E Streets, and in the new annex to the Library of Congress.&quot;

During World War II, MacLeish also served as director of the War Department&#x27;s Office of Facts and Figures, and as the assistant director of the Office of War Information. These jobs were heavily involved with propaganda, which was well-suited to MacLeish&#x27;s talents; he had written quite a bit of politically motivated work in the previous decade. He spent a year as the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and a further year representing the U.S. at the creation of UNESCO, where he contributed to the preamble of its 1945 Constitution (&quot;Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed.&quot;). After this, he retired from public service and returned to academia.

==Return to writing==
Despite a long history of debate over the merits of Marxism, MacLeish came under fire from anticommunists in the 1940s and 1950s, including J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy. Much of this was due to his involvement with left-wing organizations such as the League of American Writers, and to his friendships with prominent left-wing writers. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Whittaker Chambers cited him as a fellow traveler in a 1941 article: &quot;By 1938, U. S. Communists could count among their allies such names as Granville Hicks, Newton Arvin, Waldo Frank, Lewis Mumford, Matthew Josephson, Kyle Crichton (Robert Forsythe), Malcolm Cowley, Donald Ogden Stewart, Erskine Caldwell, Dorothy Parker, Archibald MacLeish, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, John Steinbeck, George Soule, many another.&quot;

In 1949, MacLeish became the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. He held this position until his retirement in 1962. In 1959, his play &quot;J.B.&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. From 1963 to 1967, he was the John Woodruff Simpson Lecturer at Amherst College. In 1969, MacLeish met Bob Dylan, and asked him to contribute songs to &quot;Scratch&quot;, a musical MacLeish was writing, based on the story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; by Stephen Vincent Benét. The collaboration was a failure and &quot;Scratch&quot; opened without any music; Dylan describes their collaboration in the third chapter of his autobiography &quot;Chronicles, Vol. 1&quot;.

MacLeish greatly admired T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and his work shows quite a bit of their influence. He was the literary figure who played the most important role in Ezra Pound’s release from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he was held between 1946 and 1958, after being found unfit to stand trial for high treason. MacLeish&#x27;s early work was very traditionally modernist and accepted the contemporary modernist position holding that a poet was isolated from society. His most well-known poem, &quot;Ars Poetica,&quot; contains a classic statement of the modernist aesthetic: &quot;A poem should not mean / But be.&quot; He later broke with modernism&#x27;s pure aesthetic. MacLeish himself was greatly involved in public life and came to believe that this was not only an appropriate, but also an inevitable role for a poet.

In 1969, MacLeish was commissioned by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write a poem to celebrate the Apollo 11 Moon landing, which he entitled &quot;Voyage to the Moon.&quot; The poem appeared on the front page of the July 21, 1969 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. A. M. Rosenthal, then-editor of &quot;Time&quot;, later recounted: &quot;We decided what the front page of &quot;Time&quot; would need when the men landed was a poem. What the poet wrote would count most, but we also wanted to say to our readers, look, this paper does not know how to express how it feels this day and perhaps you don&#x27;t either, so here is a fellow, a poet, who will try for all of us. We called one poet who just did not think much of moons or us, and then decided to reach higher for somebody with more zest in his soul – for Archibald MacLeish, winner of three Pulitzer Prizes. He turned in his poem on time and entitled it &#x27;Voyage to the Moon.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==
MacLeish worked to promote the arts, culture, and libraries. Among other impacts, MacLeish was the first Librarian of Congress to begin the process of naming what would become the United States Poet Laureate. The Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress came from a donation in 1937 from Archer M. Huntington, a wealthy ship builder. Like many donations, it came with strings attached. In this case, Huntington wanted poet Joseph Auslander to be named to the position. MacLeish found little value in Auslander&#x27;s writing. However, MacLeish was happy that having Auslander in the post attracted many other poets, such as Robinson Jeffers and Robert Frost, to hold readings at the library. He set about establishing the consultantship as a revolving post rather than a lifetime position. In 1943, MacLeish displayed his love of poetry and the Library of Congress by naming Louise Bogan to the position. Bogan, who had long been a hostile critic of MacLeish&#x27;s own writing, asked MacLeish why he appointed her to the position; MacLeish replied that she was the best person for the job. For MacLeish, promoting the Library of Congress and the arts was vitally more important than petty personal conflicts.

In the June 5, 1972, issue of &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, MacLeish laid out in an essay his philosophy on libraries and librarianship, further shaping modern thought on the subject:

Two collections of MacLeish&#x27;s papers are held at the Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. These are the Archibald MacLeish Collection and the Archibald MacLeish Collection Addition. Additionally, more than 13,500 items from his papers and his personal library are held in the Archibald MacLeish Collection at Greenfield Community College in Greenfield, Massachusetts. 
 Smith College&#x27;s MacLeish Field Station is named after MacLeish and his wife Ada, who were close friends of former Smith president Jill Ker Conway and introduced her to the natural environment around Northampton, Massachusetts. 

==Personal life==
In 1916, he married Ada Hitchcock, a musician. MacLeish had three children: Kenneth, Mary Hillard, and William, the author of a memoir of his father, &quot;Uphill with Archie&quot; (2001). He died in 1982, at the age of 89.

==Astronomy==
* The first description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on observations by telescope is given by Simon Marius.
* December 28 – Galileo observes the planet Neptune for the first time when it is in conjunction with Jupiter, but mistakenly catalogues it as a fixed star because of its extremely slow motion along the ecliptic, and it will not be properly identified until 1846.

==Medicine==
* Santorio Sanctorius puts the thermometer to medical use.

==Births==
* &quot;approx. date&quot; – William Gascoigne, English inventor (died 1644)

* February 6 – Christopher Clavius, German mathematician and astronomer (born 1537)

<text>A traveling-wave tube (TWT, pronounced &quot;twit&quot;) or traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA, pronounced &quot;tweeta&quot;) is a specialized vacuum tube that is used in electronics to amplify radio frequency (RF) signals in the microwave range. It was invented by Andrei Haeff around 1933 as a graduate student at Caltech, and its present form was invented by Rudolf Kompfner in 1942–43. The TWT belongs to a category of &quot;linear beam&quot; tubes, such as the klystron, in which the radio wave is amplified by absorbing power from a beam of electrons as it passes down the tube. Although there are various types of TWT, two major categories are:
*&quot;Helix TWT&quot; - in which the radio waves interact with the electron beam while traveling down a wire helix which surrounds the beam. These have wide bandwidth, but output power is limited to a few hundred watts.
*&quot;Coupled cavity TWT&quot; - in which the radio wave interacts with the beam in a series of cavity resonators through which the beam passes. These function as narrowband power amplifiers.
A major advantage of the TWT over some other microwave tubes is its ability to amplify a wide range of frequencies i.e. a large bandwidth. The bandwidth of the helix TWT can be as high as two octaves, while the cavity versions have bandwidths of 10–20%. Operating frequencies range from 300 MHz to 50 GHz. The power gain of the tube is on the order of 40 to 70 decibels, and output power ranges from a few watts to megawatts.

TWTs are widely used as the power amplifiers and oscillators in radar systems, communication satellite and spacecraft transmitters, and electronic warfare systems.

==Description==

===A basic TWT===
The TWT is an elongated vacuum tube with an electron gun (a heated cathode that emits electrons) at one end. A voltage applied across the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons towards the far end of the tube, and an external magnetic field around the tube focuses the electrons into a beam. At the other end of the tube the electrons strike the &quot;collector&quot;, which returns them to the circuit.

Wrapped around the inside of the tube, just outside the beam path, is a helix of wire, typically oxygen-free copper. The RF signal to be amplified is fed into the helix at a point near the emitter end of the tube. The signal is normally fed into the helix via a waveguide or electromagnetic coil placed at one end, forming a one-way signal path, a directional coupler.

By controlling the accelerating voltage, the speed of the electrons flowing down the tube is set to be similar to the speed of the RF signal running down the helix. The signal in the wire causes a magnetic field to be induced in the center of the helix, where the electrons are flowing. Depending on the phase of the signal, the electrons will either be sped up or slowed down as they pass the windings. This causes the electron beam to &quot;bunch up&quot;, known technically as &quot;velocity modulation&quot;. The resulting pattern of electron density in the beam is an analog of the original RF signal.

Because the beam is passing the helix as it travels, and that signal varies, it causes induction in the helix, amplifying the original signal. By the time it reaches the other end of the tube, this process has had time to deposit considerable energy back into the helix. A second directional coupler, positioned near the collector, receives an amplified version of the input signal from the far end of the RF circuit. Attenuators placed along the RF circuit prevent the reflected wave from traveling back to the cathode.

Higher powered helix TWTs usually contain beryllium oxide ceramic as both a helix support rod and in some cases, as an electron collector for the TWT because of its special electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties.

===Comparison===
There are a number of RF amplifier tubes that operate in a similar fashion to the TWT, known collectively as velocity-modulated tubes. The best known example is the klystron. All of these tubes use the same basic &quot;bunching&quot; of electrons to provide the amplification process, and differ largely in what process causes the velocity modulation to occur.

In the klystron, the electron beam passes through a hole in a resonant cavity which is connected to the source RF signal. The signal at the instant the electrons pass through the hole causes them to be accelerated (or decelerated). The electrons enter a &quot;drift tube&quot; in which faster electrons overtake the slower ones, creating the bunches, after which the electrons pass through another resonant cavity from which the output power is taken. Since the velocity sorting process takes time, the drift tube must often be several feet long.

In comparison, in the TWT the acceleration is caused by the interactions with the helix along the entire length of the tube. This allows the TWT to have a very low noise output, a major advantage of the design. More usefully, this process is much less sensitive to the physical arrangement of the tube, which allows the TWT to operate over a wider variety of frequencies. TWT&#x27;s are generally at an advantage when low noise and frequency variability are useful.

===Coupled-cavity TWT===
Helix TWTs are limited in peak RF power by the current handling (and therefore thickness) of the helix wire. As power level increases, the wire can overheat and cause the helix geometry to warp. Wire thickness can be increased to improve matters, but if the wire is too thick it becomes impossible to obtain the required helix pitch for proper operation. Typically helix TWTs achieve less than 2.5 kW output power.

The coupled-cavity TWT overcomes this limit by replacing the helix with a series of coupled cavities arranged axially along the beam. This structure provides a helical waveguide, and hence amplification can occur via velocity modulation. Helical waveguides have very nonlinear dispersion and thus are only narrowband (but wider than klystron). A coupled-cavity TWT can achieve 60 kW output power.

Operation is similar to that of a klystron, except that coupled-cavity TWTs are designed with attenuation between the slow-wave structure instead of a drift tube. The slow-wave structure gives the TWT its wide bandwidth. A free electron laser allows higher frequencies.

==Traveling-wave-tube amplifier==
A TWT integrated with a regulated power supply and protection circuits is referred to as a traveling-wave-tube amplifier (abbreviated TWTA and often pronounced &quot;TWEET-uh&quot;). It is used to produce high-power radio frequency signals. The bandwidth of a broadband TWTA can be as high as one octave, although tuned (narrowband) versions exist; operating frequencies range from 300 MHz to 50 GHz.

A TWTA consists of a traveling-wave tube coupled with its protection circuits (as in klystron) and regulated power supply electronic power conditioner (EPC), which may be supplied and integrated by a different manufacturer. The main difference between most power supplies and those for vacuum tubes is that efficient vacuum tubes have depressed collectors to recycle kinetic energy of the electrons, so the secondary winding of the power supply needs up to 6 taps of which the helix voltage needs precise regulation. The subsequent addition of a linearizer (as for inductive output tube) can, by complementary compensation, improve the gain compression and other characteristics of the TWTA; this combination is called a linearized TWTA (LTWTA, &quot;EL-tweet-uh&quot;).

Broadband TWTAs generally use a helix TWT and achieve less than 2.5 kW output power. TWTAs using a coupled cavity TWT can achieve 15 kW output power, but at the expense of narrower bandwidth.

==Invention, development and early use==
The original design and prototype of the TWT was done by Andrei &quot;Andy&quot; Haeff c. 1931 while he was working as a doctoral student at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech. His original patent, &quot;Device for and Method of Controlling High Frequency Currents&quot;, was filed in 1933 and granted in 1936.

The invention of the TWT is often attributed to Rudolf Kompfner in 1942–1943. In addition, Nils Lindenblad, working at RCA (Radio Corporation of America) in the USA also filed a patent for a device in May 1940 that was remarkably similar to Kompfner&#x27;s TWT. Both of these devices were improvements over Haeff&#x27;s original design as they both used the then newly invented precision electron gun as the source of the electron beam and they both directed the beam down the center of the helix instead of outside of it. These configuration changes resulted in much greater wave amplification than Haeff&#x27;s design as they relied on the physical principles of velocity modulation and electron bunching. Kompfner developed his TWT in a British Admiralty radar laboratory during World War II. His first sketch of his TWT is dated November 12, 1942, and he built his first TWT in early 1943.
The TWT was later refined by Kompfner, John R. Pierce, and Lester M. Winslow at Bell Labs. Note that Kompfner&#x27;s US patent, granted in 1953, does cite Haeff&#x27;s previous work.

By the 1950s, after further development at the Electron Tube Laboratory at Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California, TWTs went into production there, and by the 1960s TWTs were also produced by such companies as the English Electric Valve Company, followed by Ferranti in the 1970s.

On July 10, 1962, the first communications satellite, Telstar 1, was launched with a 2 W, 4 GHz RCA-designed TWT transponder used for transmitting RF signals to Earth stations. Syncom 2 was successfully launched into geosynchronous orbit on July 26, 1963, with two 2 W, 1850 MHz Hughes-designed TWT transponders — one active and one spare.

==Uses==
TWTAs are commonly used as amplifiers in satellite transponders, where the input signal is very weak and the output needs to be high power. TWTAs used in satellite communications are considered as reliable choices and tend to live beyond their expected lifetime of 15-20 years.

A TWTA whose output drives an antenna is a type of transmitter. TWTA transmitters are used extensively in radar, particularly in airborne fire-control radar systems, and in electronic warfare and self-protection systems. In such applications, a control grid is typically introduced between the TWT&#x27;s electron gun and slow-wave structure to allow pulsed operation. The circuit that drives the control grid is usually referred to as a grid modulator.

TWTAs have found applications in a number of spacecraft, including all five of the space probes that have achieved the escape velocity to leave the Solar System. For example, dual redundant 12-watt X-band TWTAs are mounted on the body under the dish of the New Horizons spacecraft, which visited Pluto in 2015, then Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth in 2019 to return data at a distance of 43.4 AU from the Sun. Launched in 2021, James Webb Space Telescope makes use of Ka-band TWTs.

==Historical notes==

A TWT has sometimes been referred to as a &quot;traveling-wave amplifier tube&quot; (TWAT), although this term was never widely adopted. &quot;TWT&quot; has been pronounced by engineers as &quot;twit&quot;, and &quot;TWTA&quot; as &quot;tweeta&quot;.

<doc id="473177" wikidata="Q285162" url="?curid=473177" title="Mamihlapinatapai">
<text>The word mamihlapinatapai is derived from the Yaghan language of Tierra del Fuego, listed in &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;most succinct word&quot;, and is considered one of the hardest words to translate. It has been translated as &quot;a look that without words is shared by two people who want to initiate something, but that neither will start&quot; or &quot;looking at each other hoping that the other will offer to do something which both parties desire but are unwilling to do&quot;.

A romantic interpretation of the meaning has also been given, as &quot;that look across the table when two people are sharing an unspoken but private moment. When each knows the other understands and is in agreement with what is being expressed. An expressive and meaningful silence.&quot;

A literal translation could be &quot;to make each other feel awkward&quot;.

==Morphology==
The word consists of the reflexive/passive prefix &quot;ma-&quot; (&quot;mam-&quot; before a vowel), the root &quot;ihlapi&quot; (pronounced ), which means &quot;to be at a loss as what to do next&quot;, the stative suffix &quot;-n&quot;, an achievement suffix &quot;-ata,&quot; and the dual suffix &quot;-apai&quot;, which in composition with the reflexive &quot;mam-&quot; has a reciprocal sense.

==Usage==
The term is cited in books and articles on game theory associated with the volunteer&#x27;s dilemma.

It is also referenced in &quot;Defining the World&quot; in a discussion of the difficulties facing Samuel Johnson in trying to arrive at succinct, yet accurate, definitions of words.

<doc id="473178" wikidata="Q1890129" url="?curid=473178" title="Sweetwater (band)">
<text>Sweetwater was an American rock band originally from Los Angeles, California. They were the act scheduled to open the Woodstock festival in 1969 but were delayed by traffic, so folk singer Richie Havens&#x27;s trio became the first act to perform. The band was eventually flown to the festival by helicopter and performed after Swami Satchidananda&#x27;s invocation.

== History == 
The original members of the band were Nancy &quot;Nansi&quot; Nevins (lead vocals/guitar), August Burns (cello), Albert Moore (flute/backing vocals), Alan Malarowitz (drums), Elpidio Cobian (conga), Alex Del Zoppo (keyboards) and Fred Herrera (bass).

Sweetwater originally formed to perform in local coffeehouses in Los Angeles until being signed to a major label. The members of the band were early developers of the psychedelic rock/folk rock fusion style that was popularized by acts such as Jefferson Airplane. In 1968–69, the band often toured with the Doors. They were also one of the opening acts for the Animals in 1968. One of their best-known recordings is a version of the traditional folk song &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot;. It appeared on their debut album &quot;Sweetwater&quot;, the band&#x27;s only album to chart nationally in the U.S. As the band progressed, their sound moved closer to that of the psychedelic folk genre.

Three days after Sweetwater performed on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; on December 30, 1969, Nevins was severely injured in an auto accident with a drunk driver. She suffered a brain injury that left her in a coma for 10 days, and she suffered damage to a vocal cord as a result of the tracheotomy performed to save her life. Nevins would never again complete a full album with the band, although she still had some recordings prepared for the next two albums. For several years, there was a widespread but unfounded belief that Beverly Bivens, formerly of the West Coast group We Five, had died in a car accident. It is thought that confusion over names (Bivens/Nevins) may have contributed to this rumor.

The group reunited for Woodstock &#x27;94 in 1994 with three original members: Nevins, Herrera and Del Zoppo. Burns died after contracting pneumonia while being treated in a German hospital for injuries that he had suffered after falling out of a construction elevator in 1979, Malarowitz was killed in a car crash in 1981 and Moore died of lung cancer in 1994. Cobian works as an underwater welder in the film industry.

In 1999, the band&#x27;s story was depicted in a VH1 television movie titled &quot;Sweetwater: A True Rock Story&quot;. Amy Jo Johnson portrayed Nevins as a young woman, and Michelle Phillips played Nevins as an older woman.

<doc id="473182" wikidata="Q1930746" url="?curid=473182" title="Skibbereen">
<text>Skibbereen (; ) is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It is located in West Cork on the N71 national secondary road. The River Ilen runs through the town; it reaches the sea about 12 kilometres away, at the seaside village of Baltimore. Located in a tourist area, Tragumna beach is nearby.

The town of Skibbereen, sometimes shortened to &quot;Skibb&quot;, is in the Cork South-West Dáil constituency, which has three seats. As of the 2022 census, the population of the town was 2,903.

==Toponymy==
Skibbereen is located on the River Ilen. In his book &quot;The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places&quot; (1869), the historian Patrick Weston Joyce suggests that the Irish place name &quot;Sciobairín&quot; or &quot;Scibirín&quot; derives from the small boats or skiffs (&quot;scibs&quot;) that were common on this stretch of the river.

==History==
Prior to 1600, most of the land in the area belonged to the native MacCarthy Reagh dynasty. The town charter dates back to 1657 and a copy can be seen in the town council chambers. In 1631, Skibbereen received an influx of refugees fleeing from the Sack of Baltimore. The &quot;Phoenix Society&quot; was founded in Skibbereen in 1856 and was a precursor to the Fenian movement.
A statue, the &#x27;Maid of Erin&#x27; erected in 1904, sits on top of a memorial to commemorate four failed uprisings against British rule, the dates of which are engraved on each side of the plinth: 1798, 1803, 1848, 1867.
Skibbereen was once a stop on the West Cork Railway, which scheduled trains from West Cork to Cork City. The construction of the railways took place between 1851 and 1893 and by 1961, all West Cork railway lines were closed. Skibbereen also had a separate terminus station on the narrow-gauge Schull and Skibbereen Tramway and Light Railway. Skibbereen Town Hall was erected in around 1862.

===Famine===

The region around Skibbereen experienced a significant famine in the years 1845–52, a time referred to as The Great Hunger or Great Famine (Irish: &quot;an Gorta Mór&quot;). The Skibbereen Heritage Centre estimates that 8,000 to 10,000 victims of the Famine are buried in the famine burial pits of Abbeystrewery cemetery close to the town. While there is some question on the accuracy of census data from the famine era, records indicate a drop of population from 58,335 in 1841 to 32,412 in 1861.
&quot;Skibbereen&quot; is also the name of a song about the Famine, and the impact it and the British Government had on the people of Ireland. The song, also known as &quot;Dear Old Skibbereen&quot;, takes the form of a conversation between a father and a son, in which the son asks his father why he fled the land he loved so well.

A permanent exhibition to commemorate the memory of the victims of the Great Famine is sited at the Skibbereen Heritage Centre. Skibbereen was also the focal point of Ireland&#x27;s first National Famine Memorial Day on 17 May 2009. The town was selected as it was in one of the areas worst affected by the Great Famine. The National Famine Commemoration Committee agreed that the centrepiece of the memorial day would rotate between the Four Provinces on an annual basis.

==Media==

The &quot;Skibbereen Eagle&quot;, a newspaper founded in 1857, published both local and international stories. For example, it published an editorial that &quot;&quot;told Lord Palmerston that it had &#x27;got its eye both upon him and on the Emperor of Russia&#x27;.&quot; And a 1914 article said &quot;We give this solemn warning to Kaiser Wilhelm: The Skibbereen Eagle has its eye on you.&quot;&quot; This newspaper was superseded by the &quot;Southern Star&quot;, which was founded in Skibbereen in 1889.

==Sport==
O&#x27;Donovan Rossa GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. The local secondary school St. Fachtna&#x27;s was a finalist in 1982 and a winner in 1991 of the Hogan Cup for Gaelic football.

Skibbereen Rowing Club is situated on the outskirts of the town, and is one of the most successful clubs in Ireland. Club members Paul and Gary O&#x27;Donovan won silver at the 2016 summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s lightweight double sculls, the first Olympic medal won by Irish rowers. Paul O&#x27;Donovan and fellow club member Fintan McCarthy also won gold at both the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

A.F.C.Skibbereen is the local association football (soccer) club, with other sports clubs including Skibbereen Golf Club, Skibbereen Rugby Club, and Skibbereen Athletics Club.

==Education==
There are four primary schools located in the town, including Abbeystrewry National School (a mixed school), Gaelscoil Dr. Uí Shúilleabháin (a mixed Irish-speaking school), St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary School (boys), and Scoil Naomh Seosamh (girls)

The town&#x27;s previous three secondary schools (Rossa College, St Fachtna&#x27;s De la Salle and Mercy Heights) were amalgamated into a new school, called Skibbereen Community School, which opened in September 2016.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 census, there were 2,670 people living in Skibbereen. In terms of religion, the 2011 census recorded this population as being 79% Catholic, 11.5% other stated religion, 7% with no religion, and 1.5% not stated.

By the 2016 census the population was 2,778. In 2016, the Skibbereen Urban and Skibbereen Rural electoral divisions were 75.6% white Irish, 18.8% other white ethnicities, 0.6% black, 1.2% Asian, 1% of other ethnicity, and 2.9% with no stated ethnicity. As of 2016, 5.4% of Skibbereen&#x27;s urban population identified with a UK nationality, compared to an average of 2.6% for the county as a whole.

As of the 2022 census, Skibbereen had a population of 2,903. The population consisted of 64.1% White Irish, 21.8% other White ethnicities, 0.6% Black or Black Irish, 3.6% Asian or Asian Irish, 1.7% of other ethnicities, 1.2% Irish Traveller, and 7.1% with no stated ethnicity.

== Culture ==
Festivals held in Skibbereen include the annual Skibbereen Arts Festival. This typically takes place at the end of July and includes community-based projects as well film screenings, theatre, visual art and music acts.

An agricultural festival, the Carbery Show, also takes place in July. This show includes agricultural, horticultural, livestock, craft, bakery and other competitions, as well as a pet show, and trade exhibition. The first Carbery Show took place in 1836.

Music events are also held locally, with several bars and venues in town hosting musical acts. Skibbereen has also hosted the Cork X Southwest Music &amp; Arts Festival over several years. The 2011 festival was held at Liss Ard Estate and featured Patti Smith, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Balkan Beat Box, Fred and others across a two-day lineup.

<text>Bilocate is a dark Oriental metal band from Amman, Jordan, founded in 2002 by Ramzi Essayed, Waseem Essayed and Hani Al Abbadi. The band&#x27;s style combines doom metal, death metal and black metal with Oriental elements.

==History==
The band was founded by the brothers Ramzi and Waseem Essayed and their friend Hani Al Abadi, and got started when they were joined by guitarist Baha&#x27; Farah, and later by guitarist Rami Haikal. Their first full-length album, &quot;Dysphoria&quot;, was released in the winter of 2005, and received significant airplay on the local governmental radio station &quot;Jordan FM&quot;, with a 5-hour show being dedicated to the band and the album on October 27. They released a music video for &quot;2nd War in Heaven.&quot; A second video, for &quot;Days of Joy,&quot; was produced by Jacknife Video Productions. Bilocate added a new drummer, Ahmad Kloob, in late 2006, and started preparing for a new album.

In July 2008, &quot;Sudden Death Syndrome&quot; was released, mixed and mastered by Jens Bogren (Opeth, Bloodbath, Katatonia, Paradise Lost, and others). The album received positive reviews from magazines and websites such as &quot;Decibel&quot; and Blabbermouth.net. The album was self-released and is now distributed in the United States via The Omega Order, the distribution arm of The End Records. In December 2008, &quot;Terrorizer&quot; reviewed &quot;Sudden Death Syndrome&quot;, calling it &quot;a tasteful and sophisticated piece of work that determinedly puts the Jordanian metal scene on the map.&quot; The album has led to extensive coverage for the band in the West in the heavy metal media online as well as in print, such as interviews with &quot;Terrorizer&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;; the latter praised their &quot;rich, doomy sound&quot; and called &quot;Sudden Death Syndrome&quot; a &quot;stunning, heartfelt metal album.&quot; Metal Storm nominated the album for its Best Doom Metal Album Award; Bilocate&#x27;s album finished in sixth place (of ten).

Heavy metal music is still controversial in Jordan, as suggested in a brief interview with &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, December 2008, in which Rami Haikal said, &quot;We have even been told to dissolve the band and to stop publishing our music by any means.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, Waseem Essayed said, &quot;We are facing a lot of pressure and a huge rejection from security, religious authorities, and the community.&quot; The UAE newspaper &quot;The National&quot; reported in October 2008, in a series of articles called &quot;Young in the Muslim World,&quot; that a Bilocate concert in Jordan was canceled by authorities, &quot;citing unspecified &#x27;security reasons.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="473185" wikidata="Q3349931" url="?curid=473185" title="Saqlain Mushtaq">
<text>Saqlain Mushtaq (born 29 December 1976) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former international cricketer who was the head coach of the Pakistani national cricket team between 2021 and 2022. He is best known for pioneering the &quot;doosra&quot;, a leg break delivery bowled with an off break action. He was the fastest to reach the milestones of 200 and 250 wickets in ODIs. Mushtaq made history when he became the first Pakistani to take a hat-trick at a Cricket World Cup, which he did against Zimbabwe during the 1999 tournament.

A right-arm off break bowler, Saqlain played 49 Test matches and 169 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Pakistan between 1995 and 2004. He took 208 Test and 288 ODI wickets and also scored a Test match century, against New Zealand, in March 2001. Until 2016, Saqlain was the fastest bowler in the history of ODI cricket to take 100 wickets.

== Early life and family ==
Saqlain was born to a government clerk on 29 December 1976, in Lahore into a Punjabi family. His ancestral home is in village Chali Khoo in Amritsar district of East Punjab, now in India. He has two elder brothers: Sibtain, who also played first-class cricket for Lahore, and Zulqurnain. Saqlain played for Govt. M.A.O. College Lahore for three years and won the championship each year. Saqlain never played cricket at school level, but started playing for Zareef Memorial Cricket Club Second Eleven when he was only 13. He always wanted to be an off-spinner: &quot;I never wanted to be a quick bowler. I was very skinny and never had too much strength in the body.&quot; Saqlain was coached by Ahmad Hassan and his brothers at the club level. At the age of 14, he went to the Govt. M.A.O. College Lahore, where he was coached by Mumtaz Akhtar Butt. He played for the college and won the championship for three consecutive years.

Saqlain Mushtaq married Sana Mushtaq, a British Pakistani, in December 1998. He received his British passport in 2007. His daughter, Malika, is married to Pakistani cricketer Shadab Khan.

== Career ==
=== Domestic career ===
Saqlain started his first-class career in 1994–95 at the age of 17. In his first season, he took 52 wickets and was selected to play for Pakistan A in a one-day tournament at Dhaka. In September 1995, he got international recognition, taking seven wickets for the PCB Patron&#x27;s Eleven against the visiting Sri Lankans. Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said of him that he was &quot;the greatest off-spinner he has seen&quot; and &quot;as aggressive as a fast bowler, not afraid of getting hit, and has this total belief in himself.&quot;

Saqlain represented Surrey for eight successive seasons from 1997 to 2004. However, his time was interrupted there and his international career with Pakistan effectively ended in 2004. In August 2005, he played his first match against Bangladesh A after recovering from injury and took 4–87 from 35 overs over two innings. However, that same week, in his return to the County Championship, he conceded 110 off 28 overs against Gloucestershire, taking just one wicket.

In February 2006 he signed for Ireland for the C&amp;G Trophy, along with teammate Abdul Razzaq. Later, in February 2007, Sussex announced that Saqlain had signed a two-year contract with them. His initial requirement was to cover for fellow Pakistanis Mushtaq Ahmed and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, who were part of Pakistan&#x27;s World Cup campaign. On 26 September 2007, Saqlain was released by the county on his request. On 8 October 2007, Saqlain was re-signed by Surrey. On 28 October, according to ESPNcricinfo, he was released by Surrey.

In April 2009 he joined Old Whitgiftians CC to play in the Surrey Championship. He took 64 wickets in his first season, including five 5-wicket hauls, to earn Whits promotion to the first division. He was also involved in the youth setup. In 2010, after relocating to Leicestershire, he joined Syston Town Cricket Club, playing in the Everards County League. In late 2010, he was training in Taunton at the facilities of Somerset County Cricket Club, whom he has now joined as a temporary spin-bowling coach for the 2011 Caribbean Twenty20 competition. On 11 April 2013, it was announced that Saqlain would be joining Birmingham League Division Three Side Evesham for the 2013 Season.

=== International career ===

====Test career====
Saqlain made his Test debut in September 1995 against Sri Lanka at Arbab Niaz Stadium, Peshawar. He picked up four wickets at an average of 26.75 in the match, and accumulated nine wickets in the series from two Tests. His next remarkable series was against the same team, after which he topped the list of wicket-takers with 14 in two Tests, including nine wickets in the first match of the series. Six months later he took a five-wicket haul against South Africa at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium—first Test of the home series. In the next home series, against West Indies, he played in the third Test at the National Stadium, Karachi. He took nine wickets for 80 runs, earning him the man-of-the-match award and ensuring Pakistan&#x27;s clean sweep against the touring side. His next prominent performance was against Zimbabwe at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, where he claimed a five-wicket haul.

The highlight of his Test career came in the away series against India in 1999, where he achieved his first ten-wicket haul in a Test match. He took five-wicket hauls in both innings of the match, In the first Test, with India needing only 17 runs to win, Saqlain effectively sealed Pakistan&#x27;s win by taking the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar, who had scored 136. In the second Test of the series at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi, he once again took five-wicket hauls in both innings but could not prevent defeat. He ended the series with 20 wickets at an average of 20.15, which earned him the man-of-the-series award.

In November 1999, when Pakistan toured Australia, he took 10 wickets in two Test matches, including six wickets for 46 runs in Hobart. In Pakistan&#x27;s tour to the West Indies in 2000 he was ineffective, taking only six wickets in five innings, which included five for 121 at Kensington Oval. His career-best bowling in an innings came in November 2000 against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, in a match in which he took 8 wickets for 164 runs in the first innings. The performance earned him a man-of-the-match award. He was the highest wicket-taker of the series, accumulating 18 wickets with an average of 23.94. In the 2001–02 season, Saqlain took seven wickets against Bangladesh. In the 2002–03 season, he took 15 wickets against Zimbabwe at their home; averaging 21.53, he was the highest wicket-taker of the series.

Saqlain played 49 Test matches for Pakistan during 1995 and 2004 and accumulated 208 wickets at an average of 29.83. He took 13 five-wicket hauls and three ten-wicket hauls, and his best performance for a match was 10 wickets for 155 runs. As a batsman, he scored 927 runs with the average of 14.48, including a century and two fifties. His highest score in the format was 101 not out against New Zealand at Jade Stadium, Christchurch.

====One Day International career====
Saqlain made his One Day International (ODI) debut in September 1995 against Sri Lanka at the Municipal Stadium, Gujranwala. He could not take a wicket, but Pakistan won the match by 9 wickets. His first match-winning performance came against same team in the final match of 1996 Singer Cup. He took 3 wickets in the match. His career-best bowling figures in this format are 5 wickets for 20 runs against England at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, in October 2000. He took five-wicket hauls in ODIs on six occasions. He claimed two hat-tricks, both against Zimbabwe, the first in 1996 and the second in 1999, when he became the first Pakistani to do so at a World Cup.

===Coaching career===
On 28 May 2016, Saqlain Mushtaq was appointed by the ECB as England&#x27;s spin consultant for the home series against Pakistan.

On 29 October 2016, the ECB decided to use Saqlain&#x27;s services to prepare England team for the test series against India. On 13 November 2016, it was announced that he would remain with the England team until the end of the third Test in Mohali, after agreeing an extension to his deal with the ECB.

On 6 September 2021, he was appointed the interim head coach of Pakistan national cricket team by PCB after Misbah-ul-Haq&#x27;s resignation from the post. In February 2022, due to team&#x27;s excellent performance under him, his contract was extended for a year.

Saqlain is credited with the invention of the &quot;doosra&quot;, an off-spinner&#x27;s delivery bowled with an action similar to that of an off-break. However, it spins in the opposite direction (i.e. from the leg side to the off side), confusing batsmen, which makes it an effective weapon. Saqlain became well known for this variation ball, which was integral to his success, although he received criticism for overusing it. Other bowlers like Shoaib Malik, Saeed Ajmal, Muttiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis, Johan Botha and Harbhajan Singh also used this delivery in international cricket.

During his time at Surrey Saqlain worked on developing new deliveries, which he called the &quot;teesra&quot; which means &quot;third one&quot; and the &quot;chotha&quot;. He used the teesra in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) while playing for Lahore Badshahs. Russel Arnold of Sri Lanka was the first player to face the teesra. He was also the first batsman to get out from a teesra. However, little else is known about these deliveries. Later, this delivery was used by Saeed Ajmal against England in 2012.

His other variation was the arm ball, which again uses a similar grip to the leg-break, but imparts back-spin instead of side-spin and causes the ball to go straight on.

== Records and achievements ==
* He has taken 13 Test five-wicket hauls with 3 Test tenfers. In ODI, he took seven five-wicket hauls.
* Saqlain was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 2000.
* A statistical analysis conducted by Wisden in 2003 revealed Saqlain as the all-time greatest ODI spinner, and the sixth-greatest ODI bowler.
* Was the fastest to reach the milestones of 100, 150, 200 and 250 wickets in ODIs.
* He was the first of only two spinners to have taken a hat-trick in an ODI (the other being Abdur Razzak), and the second of only four bowlers to have taken two ODI hat-tricks (Wasim Akram, Chaminda Vaas and Lasith Malinga being the others), the second of which was only the second hat-trick in a World Cup match.
* He holds the record for the most wickets in a calendar year in ODIs-69 wickets in 1997. He is also second in this elite list with 65 wickets in 1996.

<doc id="473186" wikidata="Q442991" url="?curid=473186" title="Olivia Harrison">
<text>Olivia Trinidad Harrison (née Arias; born May 18, 1948) is an American author and film producer, and the widow of English musician George Harrison of the Beatles. She first worked in the music industry in Los Angeles, for A&amp;M Records, where she met Harrison and then helped run his Dark Horse record label. In 1990, she launched the Romanian Angel Appeal to raise funds for the thousands of orphans left abandoned in Romania after the fall of Communism.

Since her husband&#x27;s death in 2001, Olivia has continued George’s international aid efforts through projects in partnership with UNICEF, and is the curator of film, book and music releases related to his legacy. She represents his voice on the Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps board and is similarly a director of his charity organisation, the Material World Foundation (MWF). Under the auspices of MWF, she has sponsored the preservation of film history in collaboration with American director Martin Scorsese. These restoration projects include short films by Charlie Chaplin and works from 1940s Mexican cinema.

She and her husband shared an interest in Eastern mysticism and spiritual practice, and her presence in his life, starting in the mid-1970s, began a period of more optimistic content in Harrison&#x27;s music. At their Friar Park home in December 1999, when she overpowered a knife-wielding intruder who had repeatedly stabbed George, she was recognized as having saved her husband&#x27;s life. Among Harrison&#x27;s film projects, her production of &quot;Concert for George&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 2005, and her co-production of Scorsese&#x27;s 2011 documentary &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot; won an Emmy Award in the category &quot;Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special&quot;. She authored books to accompany both these films, and in 2017 compiled a revised edition of George&#x27;s 1980 autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;. Her son with George, Dhani Harrison, is also a musician.

==Life==
===Childhood and music industry career===
Arias was born in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alemán/moreliafilmfest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandparents migrated to California, having grown up in Guanajuato in central Mexico. Her father, Zeke, was a dry cleaner, and her mother, Mary Louise, worked as a seamstress. Arias&#x27;s siblings include Peter and Louise. Spending her early childhood in Los Angeles, she grew up with a Mexican, Spanish-speaking entourage. In a 2016 interview, she recalled that Mexican music and films were a regular part of her upbringing, with Zeke having been a singer and guitarist, and that Jorge Negrete, Trío Calaveras and Trío Los Panchos were among the artists she enjoyed. Later in her youth her family moved west to Hawthorne where she attended Hawthorne High School in the 1960s. 
In 1972, she began working for A&amp;M Records, at the former site of Charlie Chaplin Studios in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olivia/DHYears&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, as a member of the marketing department, she regularly liaised by long-distance telephone with George Harrison, whose new record label, Dark Horse, was distributed by A&amp;M. Impressed with Arias, Harrison arranged for her to work exclusively for Dark Horse Records. The pair met for the first time in October 1974 and soon became romantically involved. Until the late 1970s, Arias worked with a roster of artists that included Ravi Shankar, Splinter, Stairsteps, Attitudes, Keni Burke and Henry McCullough. According to author Robert Rodriguez, she was &quot;a capable and even-tempered administrator, ably handling the routine chaos involved with setting up a record label and dealing with all manner of personalities&quot;.

Before meeting Harrison, Arias had studied meditation with the Indian guru Maharaj-ji. Their shared interest in spirituality, together with a lifestyle incorporating vegetarianism, had a calming effect on Harrison, whose reliance on drugs and alcohol Arias helped curb. His 1976 album &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; conveyed a more contented outlook in which he expressed his faith without the disapproving tone that, for many music critics, had marred his previous two albums. While accompanying Harrison on his promotional campaign for &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;, Arias told an interviewer: &quot;We have a nice relationship. When you strive for something higher in the next world, you have a much easier time in this one.&quot;
===Marriage to George Harrison===
Arias gave birth to the couple&#x27;s son Dhani Harrison at Princess Christian Nursing Home on 1 August 1978. The following month, Olivia and George married in a private ceremony at the Henley-on-Thames Register Office in England. Their contentment during this period was again reflected in George&#x27;s music, much of which he wrote at their holiday property on Maui in Hawaii. His self-titled 1979 album includes the song &quot;Dark Sweet Lady,&quot; which he said best captured the renewal Arias had provided in his life.

She was also habitually present in the recording studio with her husband. Producer Giles Martin said that she was often the one operating the recording button.

Following John Lennon&#x27;s murder in New York in December 1980, Olivia, George and Dhani spent much of the early 1980s travelling in the Pacific region, alternately residing in Hana on Maui, and Hamilton Island in the north-east of Australia. As the wife of a former Beatle, Olivia largely stayed out of the public spotlight. During the late 1980s, she supported George&#x27;s campaign to save Henley&#x27;s Regal Cinema from redevelopment by the John Lewis supermarket chain, and campaigned with Ringo Starr&#x27;s wife, Barbara Bach, on behalf of Parents for Safe Food. In 1989, she was the target of hate mail and death threats at George&#x27;s and her Henley estate, Friar Park, the details of which were kept secret until a London police officer leaked the story to the press the following year.
In 1990, she fully embraced the media spotlight, in reaction to the plight of around 100,000 Romanian orphans left abandoned amid the chaos that followed the deposing of Romania&#x27;s Communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu. After visiting Romania in early April, she said she was &quot;overwhelmed, devastated and shocked&quot; by the suffering she had witnessed. That same month, she founded the Romanian Angel Appeal (RAA) to provide aid to the children, having enlisted support from the other Beatles&#x27; wives: Bach, Linda McCartney and Yoko Ono. George helped her promote the appeal on British television and radio, and, with his Traveling Wilburys bandmates, recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot; to help raise funds for the orphans.

In October 1992, she wrote to &quot;The Guardian&quot; to express her disgust with the author Geoffrey Giuliano, who had recently published a biography of her husband. She accused Giuliano of falsifying a brief acquaintance with George into a friendship and criticised his depiction of Paul McCartney, whom Giuliano had dismissed as &quot;vacuous and shallow&quot;.

On December 30, 1999, George and Olivia were attacked by a deranged man who broke into Friar Park. George went downstairs after hearing noises. Moments later, George returned, followed by the intruder, and was stabbed multiple times. Olivia attacked the assailant with a fireplace poker and a heavy table lamp, and he turned on her. After the local police arrived and detained the intruder, the Harrisons were treated for their wounds at a hospital. The man was quoted as saying he was on a &quot;mission sent by God,” and that the Beatles were &quot;witches.” The home invasion was a front-page news story around the world, with some headlines recognising Olivia as having &quot;saved&quot; her husband. The attack followed the arrest of a female stalker who had broken into the Harrisons&#x27; Maui home on December 23. In a 2005 interview, Olivia said of the December 30 incident: &quot;I remember everything about it, every millisecond. I was terrified, but it is one of those things that you just do in a heightened state of awareness so that you can never really forget any of it.&quot;

===George&#x27;s death and aftermath===
George&#x27;s injuries from the Friar Park attack were more severe than was reported in the press and led to the removal of a portion of one of his lungs. Within a year, the cancer that he had beaten through treatment in 1998 returned in the form of lung cancer. Olivia and Dhani were at his bedside when he died in Los Angeles on November 29, 2001. She later remembered him in a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; interview: &quot;George was the funniest man I knew. When he died, I felt &#x27;Oh, no, the party&#x27;s over&#x27; … He didn&#x27;t put up with any crabbiness – other than his own.&quot;
Harrison spent a period in seclusion while mourning her loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moir/DT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she alleged that Gilbert Lederman, a doctor at Staten Island University Hospital, where George received experimental radiation therapy before travelling to Los Angeles, had acted inappropriately by forcing him to listen to the doctor&#x27;s young son playing guitar and, while in pain and lacking his mental faculties, autograph the boy&#x27;s guitar. The suit, which also addressed Lederman&#x27;s discussion of the former Beatle&#x27;s condition with the media, was settled out of court with a stipulation that the guitar be destroyed.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Harrison joined Yoko Ono (Lennon&#x27;s widow), Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in managing the Beatles musical and financial legacy, as one of the five directors of Apple Corps. In June 2006, she attended the Las Vegas launch of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Love&quot; stage show, a project George had initiated through his friendship with Guy Laliberté of Cirque du Soleil. She appeared on stage at Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference in June 2009, again with Ono, McCartney and Starr, to promote &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot;.

==Film production, album reissues and book projects==
In November 2002, Olivia Harrison produced the Concert for George tribute, which featured Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, Tom Petty, Shankar, Starr and McCartney, along with Dhani. Held at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall and filmed by director David Leland, the event was presented under the auspices of George&#x27;s Material World Foundation; all proceeds from the concert and subsequent album, film and book releases went to the foundation for dispersal to charities that he and the family supported. Harrison&#x27;s video production for the &quot;Concert for George&quot; film received the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 2005. She wrote the introduction to the 2002 reissue of George&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, and authored the book &quot;Concert for George&quot;, which was published by Genesis Publications in 2005.
Harrison has overseen reissue campaigns of her late husband&#x27;s recording catalogue. In early 2005, she operated out of an office in London&#x27;s Knightsbridge area; while in Los Angeles at that time, she used Dark Horse&#x27;s offices in Santa Monica. She helped Dhani compile the &quot;Dark Horse Years&quot; box set in 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis/LAT05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an introduction on the history of Dark Horse Records in the accompanying booklet. She co-produced the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh Revisited&quot; documentary accompanying the 2005 reissue of the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; album and film. She was reissue producer (with Dhani) of &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; in 2006. In 2007, Harrison produced the documentary included in the Traveling Wilburys box set &quot;The Traveling Wilburys Collection&quot;. In 2010, she served as compilation producer of George&#x27;s works with Ravi Shankar, in a box set titled &quot;Collaborations&quot; – a project she described as a &quot;labor of love for me&quot;. In addition to designing the elaborate packaging with Drew Lorimer, she oversaw the collection and restoration of long-lost footage of a 1974 Music Festival from India performance from the Royal Albert Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olivia/Spinner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She co-produced the Martin Scorsese documentary &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot; (2011), and appeared with Scorsese at Cannes in 2010 and in New York City in the summer of 2011 promoting it. In a radio interview with Leonard Lopate for WNYC, she said that the film had involved five years of work and that it was a project George had hoped to undertake himself after working on the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; series in the mid 1990s. She also authored the accompanying book, &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;, published by Abrams. The film won two awards at the 2012 Emmy Awards, with Harrison and her fellow producers being recognised in the category &quot;Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special&quot;.

For the 2014 reissue of George&#x27;s Apple Records solo albums, overseen by Dhani, Harrison directed a seven-minute film, &quot;The Apple Years&quot;, which was included on the DVD in the eight-disc box set of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/SecondDisc&quot;&gt;Joe Marchese, &quot;Give Me Love: George Harrison’s &#x27;Apple Years&#x27; Are Collected On New Box Set&quot;, &quot;The Second Disc&quot;, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; She compiled a revised edition of &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Extended Edition&quot;), which was published by Genesis in February 2017. The updated work involved her searching for George&#x27;s handwritten lyrics and notes for songs that he had omitted from the 1980 book&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis/LATimes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or had written in the years following its original publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gensler/BB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, referring to her dedication to preserving his legacy: &quot;I have an overdeveloped sense of duty. It obviously means everything to me.&quot;

Following her work with Scorsese on &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;, Harrison has funded film restoration projects undertaken by his non-profit organization The Film Foundation. Through the Material World Foundation, she first financed the restoration of some Charlie Chaplin short films and then of works from Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; of cinema. Emilio Fernández&#x27;s &quot;Enamorada&quot; (1946), one of three Mexican titles restored by The Film Foundation up to mid 2018, was presented by Scorsese at the Cannes Film Festival that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MexicanCinema/moreliafilmfest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, along with the surviving members of the Beatles and Yoko Ono, she produced the documentary &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot;. For this documentary she won her second Emmy as producer in the Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series category. The documentary went on to win five Emmy awards in total.

In 2022 she won a second Grammy award as a producer for the reissued limited edition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. In June 2022, she published a poetic autobiography, &quot;Came the Lightening&quot;; she was inspired to write the book by the works of Edna St. Vincent Millay.

==Philanthropy==

As of 2002, Harrison&#x27;s 1990 Romanian Angel initiative was still active. In May 1990, before the release of the fundraising single and album, ten trucks filled with food, medical supplies and clothing, together with 32 aid workers, were dispatched to Romania. According to Harrison, all the funds raised by the appeal went directly to the cause, as the administrative costs were paid for by her and the other RAA founders. In September 2000, she and George met with local representatives to monitor the progress of the RAA-funded programs for orphanage sanitation and professional staff.

Harrison has continued to develop George&#x27;s philanthropic initiatives. She is a director of the Material World Foundation (MWF), which he established in 1973 to &quot;sponsor diverse forms of artistic expression and to encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies&quot;, and of the Harrison Family Foundation. The Harrison Family Scholarship was launched by the MWF in 2002. It awards scholarships at Brown University in the United States, with preference given to non-American students, especially those from India and Mexico.

In late 2005, coinciding with the reissue of the album and film from the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh, she established The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF with an initial focus on programs in Bangladesh. As of July 2015, the fund had also assisted children affected by civil conflict, natural disasters or poverty in Brazil, India, Angola, Romania, the Horn of Africa, Burma and Nepal. Harrison contributed to actress Salma Hayek&#x27;s UNICEF fundraising campaign in response to the September 2017 Mexican earthquakes. Through the auspices of The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF, she then pledged to double the next $200,000 donation made to the campaign.

One of the fund&#x27;s initiatives has been to introduce floating schools, which allow children in remote areas of Bangladesh that are affected by seasonal flooding to continue attending school. In her work as a UNICEF sponsor, she visited Bangladesh in February 2011 to oversee the fund&#x27;s ongoing efforts there, and in 2015 promoted the UNICEF Kid Power program.

<text>Mabitac, officially the Municipality of Mabitac (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 21,275 people.

Mabitac was an excellent hunting ground for wild game three centuries ago. Native hunters used numerous cave-ins or trap-ins called &quot;bitag&quot; in the local dialect. Hence, the place was referred to as &quot;Mabitag&quot; meaning &quot;a place with many traps&quot;.

Mabitac is from Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Antipolo.

==History==
The first Spaniards who came to this place were the friars who established the first Spanish settlement in the area and began to Christianize the local population. The Spaniards, having difficulty in pronouncing the &quot;G&quot; consonant, called this place &quot;Mabitac&quot; whenever they mentioned this place. Eventually, the name found its way in the official records and maps of Laguna made by Spanish cartographers and mariners who chartered the coastal areas of Laguna de Bay.

This town was formerly a barrio of Siniloan, an immediate neighboring town. It became an independent municipality only in the year 1611, not by legislation, but by mutual agreement by and between the Spanish friars of both towns who were then the influential ruling class.

Mabitac was the site of a battle in the Philippine–American War, when on September 17, 1900, Filipinos under General Juan Cailles defeated an American force commanded by Colonel Benjamin F. Cheatham.

===World War II and Japanese occupation===

The Japanese occupation of the Philippines occurred between 1942 and 1945, when Imperial Japan occupied the Commonwealth of the Philippines during World War II. The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 1942, Japanese soldiers entered and occupied Mabitac. In 1945, the Philippine Commonwealth Army troops of the 4th, 42nd and 43rd Infantry Division and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary together with the recognized guerrillas defeated the Japanese Imperial forces during the Second Battle of Mabitac.

<doc id="473191" wikidata="Q34024" url="?curid=473191" title="Picard language">
<text>Picard (, , ) is a &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; of the Romance language family spoken in the northernmost of France and parts of Hainaut province in Belgium. Administratively, this area is divided between the French Hauts-de-France region and the Belgian Wallonia along the border between both countries due to its traditional core being the districts of Tournai and Mons (Walloon Picardy).

The language or dialect is referred to by different names, as residents of Picardy call it simply , but in the more populated region of it is called &#x27; or &#x27; (sometimes written as &quot;Chti&quot; or &quot;Chtimi&quot;). This is the area that makes up Romance Flanders, around the metropolis of Lille and Douai, and northeast Artois around Béthune and Lens. &quot;Picard&quot; is also named &#x27; around Valenciennes, &#x27; around Roubaix, or simply in general French.

In 1998, Picard native speakers amounted to 700,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom were elderly people (aged 65 and over). Since its daily use had drastically declined, Picard was declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) a &quot;severely endangered language&quot;. However, as of 2023, the Picard language was listed as “vulnerable” by UNESCO.

== Origin of the word &quot;ch&#x27;ti&quot; ==
The word &quot;ch&#x27;ti&quot;, &quot;chtimi&quot; or &quot;ch&#x27;timi&quot; to designate the Picard language was invented during the First World War by Poilus from non-Picard speaking areas to refer to their brothers in arms from Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais. It is an onomatopoeia created based on the frequent use of the /ʃ/ (&quot;ch-&quot;) phoneme and of the /ʃti/ (&quot;chti&quot;) sound in Picard: &quot;&quot;ch&#x27;ti&quot; means &quot;the one,&quot; as in the sentence &quot;ch&#x27;est chti qui a fait cha&quot;&quot; ( he is the one who has done that), for instance.

== Recognition ==
Belgium&#x27;s French Community gave full official recognition to Picard as a regional language along with Walloon, (Lorraine), (Champagne) and Lorraine German in its 1990 decree. The French government has not followed suit and has not recognized Picard as an official regional language (in line with its policy of linguistic unity, which allows for only one official language in France, as per the French Constitution), but some reports have recognized Picard as a language distinct from French.

A 1999 report by Bernard Cerquiglini, the director of the (National Institute of the French Language) stated:

The gap has continued to widen between French and the varieties of , which today we would call &quot;French dialects&quot;; , Walloon, Picard, Norman, Gallo, , , , Lorrain must be accepted among the regional languages of France; by placing them on the list [of French regional languages], they will be known from then on as .

Even if it has no official status as a language in France, Picard, along with all the other languages spoken in France, benefits from actions led by the Culture Minister&#x27;s General Delegation for the French language and the languages of France ().

== Origins ==

Picard, like French, is one of the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; and belongs to the Gallo-Roman family of languages. It consists of all the varieties used for writing () in the north of France from before 1000 (in the south of France at that time the Occitan language was used). Often, the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; are referred to simply as Old French.
Picard is phonetically quite different from the North-central &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;, which evolved into modern French. Among the most notable traits, the evolution in Picard towards palatalization is less marked than in the central &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; in which it is particularly striking; or before , tonic and , as well as in front of tonic and (from earlier &quot;*au&quot;; the open of the French &quot;porte&quot;) in central Old French but not in Picard:
* Picard &quot;keval&quot; ~ Old French &quot;cheval&quot; (horse; pronounced in Old French rather than the modern ), from &quot;*kabal&quot; (vulgar Latin &quot;caballus&quot;): retaining the original in Picard before tonic and .
* Picard &quot;gambe&quot; ~ Old French &quot;jambe&quot; (leg; pronounced in Old French rather than the modern – is the &quot;ge&quot; sound in beige), from &quot;*gambe&quot; (vulgar Latin &quot;gamba&quot;): absence of palatalization of in Picard before tonic and .
* Picard &quot;kief&quot; ~ Old French &quot;chef&quot; (leader), from &quot;*kaf&quot; (Latin &quot;caput&quot;): less palatalization of in Picard
* Picard &quot;cherf&quot; ~ Old French &quot;cerf&quot; (stag; pronounced and respectively), from &quot;*kerf&quot; (Latin &quot;cervus&quot;): simple palatalization in Picard, palatalization then fronting in Old French
The effects of palatalization can be summarised as this:
* and (tonic) , or : Picard (written &quot;ch&quot;) ~ Old French (written &quot;c&quot;)
* and + tonic or : Picard and ~ Old French and .
There are striking differences, such as Picard &quot;cachier&quot; (&#x27;to hunt&#x27;) ~ Old French &quot;chacier&quot;, which later took the modern French form of &quot;chasser&quot;.
Because of the proximity of Paris to the northernmost regions of France, French (that is, the languages that were spoken in and around Paris) greatly influenced Picard and vice versa. The closeness between Picard and French causes the former to not always be recognised as a language in its own right, but rather a &quot;distortion of French&quot; as it is often viewed.

== Dialectal variations ==
Despite being geographically and syntactically affiliated according to some linguists due to their inter-comprehensible morphosyntactic features, Picard in Picardy, Ch&#x27;timi and Rouchi still intrinsically maintain conspicuous discrepancies. 
Picard includes a variety of very closely related dialects. It is difficult to list them all accurately in the absence of specific studies on the dialectal variations, but these varieties can probably &quot;provisionally&quot; be distinguished: 
 Amiénois, Vimeu-Ponthieu, Vermandois, Thiérache, Beauvaisis, &quot;chtimi&quot; (Bassin Minier, Lille), dialects in other regions near Lille (Roubaix, Tourcoing, Mouscron, Comines), &quot;rouchi&quot; (Valenciennois) and Tournaisis, Borain, Artésien rural, Boulonnais. The varieties are defined by specific phonetic, morphological and lexical traits and sometimes by a distinctive literary tradition.

The Ch&#x27;ti language was re-popularised by the 2008 French comedy film &quot;Welcome to the Sticks&quot; (French: &quot;Bienvenue chez les Ch&#x27;tis&quot;; ) which broke nearly every box office record in France and earned over $245,000,000 worldwide on an 11 million euro budget.

== Verbs and tenses ==
The first person plural often appears in spoken Picard in the form of the neutral third person &quot;in&quot;; however, the written form prioritizes &quot;os&quot; (as in French, where &quot;on&quot; is used for &quot;nous&quot;). On the other hand, the spelling of conjugated verbs will depend on the pronunciation, which varies within the Picard domain. For instance southern Picard would read &quot;il étoait / étoét&quot; while northern Picard would read &quot;il étot&quot;. This is noted as variants in the following:



==Vocabulary==
The majority of Picard words derive from Vulgar Latin.

=== Some phrases ===
Many words are very similar to French, but a large number are unique to Picard—principally terms relating to mining or farming.

Here are several typical phrases in Picard, accompanied by French and English translations:

:J&#x27;ai prins min louchet por mi aler fouir min gardin.
::&quot;J&#x27;ai pris ma bêche pour aller bêcher mon jardin.&quot;
:::&quot;I took my spade to go dig my garden.&quot;

:J&#x27; m&#x27;in vo à chlofe, lo qu&#x27;i n&#x27;passe poin d&#x27;caroche.
::&quot;Je vais au lit, là où il ne passe pas de carrosse.&quot;
:::&quot;I go to bed where no car is running.&quot;
:Moqueu d&#x27;gins
::&quot;railleur&quot;, &quot;persifleur&quot; (lit. &quot;moqueur des gens&quot;)
:::&quot;someone who mocks or jeers at people&quot; (compare &quot;gens&quot;, which is French for &quot;people&quot;)
:Ramaseu d&#x27;sous
::&quot;personne âpre au gain&quot; (lit. &quot;ramasseur de sous&quot;)
::: &quot;a greedy person&quot;

==Use==

Picard is not taught in French schools (apart from a few one-off and isolated courses) and is generally only spoken among friends or family members. It has nevertheless been the object of scholarly research at universities in Lille and Amiens, as well as at Indiana University. Since people are now able to move around France more easily than in past centuries, the different varieties of Picard are converging and becoming more similar. In its daily use, Picard is tending to lose its distinctive features and may be confused with regional French. At the same time, even though most Northerners can understand Picard today, fewer and fewer are able to speak it, and people who speak Picard as their first language are increasingly rare, particularly under 50.

The 2008 film &quot;Welcome to the Sticks&quot;, starring comedian Dany Boon, deals with Ch&#x27;ti language and culture and the perceptions of the region by outsiders, and it was the highest-grossing French film of all time at the box office in France until it was surpassed by &quot;The Intouchables&quot;.

==Written Picard==
Today Picard is primarily a spoken language, but in the medieval period, there is a wealth of literary texts in Picard. However, Picard was not able to compete with French and was slowly reduced to the status of a regional language.

A more recent body of Picard literature, written during the last two centuries, also exists. Modern written Picard is generally a transcription of the spoken language. For that reason, words are often spelled in a variety of different ways (in the same way that English and French were before they were standardized).

One system of spelling for Picard words is similar to that of French. It is undoubtedly the easiest for French speakers to understand but can also contribute the stereotype that Picard is only a corruption of French rather than a language in its own right.

Various spelling methods have been proposed since the 1960s to offset the disadvantage and to give Picard a visual identity that is distinct from French. There is now a consensus, at least between universities, in favor of the written form known as Feller-Carton (based on the Walloon spelling system, which was developed by Jules Feller, and adapted for Picard by Professor Fernand Carton).

==Learning Picard==
Picard, although primarily a spoken language, has a body of written literature: poetry, songs (&quot;P&#x27;tit quinquin&quot; for example), comic books, etc.

A number of dictionaries and &quot;patois&quot; guides also exist (for French speakers):

<doc id="473208" wikidata="Q6757610" url="?curid=473208" title="Marco Marra">
<text>Marco Antonio Marra is a Distinguished Scientist and Director of Canada&#x27;s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre at the BC Cancer Research Centre and Professor of Medical Genetics at the University of British Columbia (UBC). He also serves as UBC Canada Research Chair in Genome Science for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and is an inductee in the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.

== Education and Early Life ==
Canadian born and educated, Dr. Marco Marra received a B.Sc. in Molecular &amp; Cell Biology and a PhD in Genetics from Simon Fraser University. The title of his PhD thesis&quot;:&quot; “Genome analysis in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;: Genetic and molecular identification of genes tightly linked to &quot;unc-22(IV)”&quot;.

Marra trained as a post-doctoral fellow at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. He went on to become Group Leader of both the EST (Express Sequence Tag) Sequencing Team and Genome Fingerprinting and Mapping Teams at Washington University in St. Louis’s Genome Sequence Center (renamed the McDonnell Genome Institute).

== Career and Research ==
During his first two years with British Columbia’s Genome Sequence Center (renamed Canada&#x27;s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre), Marra served as head of the Mapping and Sequencing teams, Associate Director and Scientific Co-Director. He also held the position of Senior Scientist at BC Cancer Research and Adjunct Professor for the Department of Medical Genetics. Marra subsequently became Professor and Head of the Department of Medical Genetics in the Faculty of Medicine at UBC.

From 2011 to 2018, Marra founded and co-directed the Genome Science and Technology Graduate Program at UBC. He also served as Adjunct Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Simon Fraser University from 2001 to 2015. Marra took over as Director of Canada&#x27;s Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre (GSC) when Dr. Smith died of cancer in 2000. 

=== Human Genome Project ===
Along with GSC co-director, Dr. Steven J.M. Jones, Marra was instrumental in creating the first map the human genome, an international initiative that allowed the data to remain in the public domain.

The paper published in the 15 February 2001 issue of Nature, titled &quot;A physical map of the human genome&quot;, describes the construction and use of the human genome map to fuel human genome sequencing. Marra made fundamental contributions to that effort by devising and then implementing clonal fingerprinting techniques that led to the construction and use of the map, which served as the centralized coordinating resource for the sequencing effort.

=== Coronavirus ===
Led by Marra, the GSC was first in the world to sequence the SARS virus in 2003. Using this information they were the first to identify SARS as a coronavirus. This discovery, along with knowledge of the SARS genome, had significant implications for many infectious diseases and vaccine development. Sequencing techniques used for SARs were also applied to many fields of research and discovery, including cancer.

In 2020, the GSC joined the Canadian COVID Genomics Network (CanCOGeN), a Genome Canada initiative to generate accessible and usable genomics data to inform COVID-19 public health decisions. The GSC was one of the first three facilities involved in sequencing 10,000 Canadians that tested positive for the virus (HostSeq) for this Government of Canada funded project. Research co-led by Marra also identified an alternative procedure for extracting nucleic acids for COVID-19 testing.

=== Precision Oncology ===
==== Personalized OncoGenomics ====
As part of a GSC initiative, Marra played a pivotal role in the first proof-of-concept for the effective use of whole genome analyses in personalized cancer medicine, leading to the development of BC Cancer’s Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program. POG, co-led by Dr. Janessa Laskin, represents one of the first applications of whole genome sequencing in a clinical setting, using information derived from thousands of individual cancer genomes and transcriptomes to identify promising therapeutic targets in individual patients.

==== Marathon of Hope ====
In 2019, Marra and the POG team became a key part of the Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network. Led by the Terry Fox Research Institute and the Terry Fox Foundation, with support from dozens of research and funding partners across Canada, this represents the country’s largest ever clinical data-sharing initiative. The Marathon of Hope aims to accelerate the adoption of precision medicine for cancer patients throughout Canada.  

Marra continues to extend the reach of genomics toward managing and eradicating disease. His research has uncovered new cancer mutations, candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and has been instrumental in demonstrating the functional interplay between the cancer genome and epigenome.

== Awards and honours ==

Marra&#x27;s contributions to genome science led to an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Simon Fraser University in 2004, and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Calgary in 2005. He is also a recipient of the Order of British Columbia and became a member of the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in 2020.

In 2024, he was appointed as an officer to the Order of Canada. He lives in Vancouver.

<doc id="473212" wikidata="Q682262" url="?curid=473212" title="Alice (1990 film)">
<text>Alice is a 1990 American fantasy romantic comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen, and starring Mia Farrow, Joe Mantegna, and William Hurt. The film is a loose reworking of Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot; and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

&quot;Alice&quot; received mildly positive reviews.

==Plot==
Alice Tate is an upper-class Manhattan homemaker who spends her days shopping, getting beauty treatments and gossiping with her friends. She has been married to wealthy Doug for 16 years, and they have two children who are being raised by a nanny.

One day, she has a brief encounter with Joe Ruffalo, a handsome jazz musician. She finds herself mysteriously attracted to him and experiences Catholic guilt for these feelings. This inner turmoil manifests itself in a backache. She is referred to Dr. Yang, an Asian herbalist who puts her under hypnosis. She reveals that what initially attracted her to her husband were in fact his superficial qualities: looks and money. She also reveals her feelings about Joe.

Dr. Yang gives Alice ancient herbs that make her act on her feelings toward Joe. They agree to meet. When the herbs wear off, Alice is appalled at her behavior and does not go to meet him as planned. The next herbs she receives turn her invisible. She spies on Joe going to visit his ex-wife Vicki. Much to prudish Alice&#x27;s horror, they have sex in Vicki&#x27;s office. Alice is now glad she did not go to meet Joe. However, the next herbal remedy allows Alice to communicate with the ghost of her first lover, Ed, who encourages her to discover more about Joe. Alice and Joe finally meet, under the pretense of their children having a &quot;play-date&quot;. Alice and Joe&#x27;s meetings become increasingly frequent.

When her guilt over her relationship with Joe becomes too much, Alice returns to Dr. Yang. Inhaling the soothing contents of a pipe, Alice falls asleep in Dr. Yang&#x27;s rooms. She has vivid dreams about her Catholic upbringing. She remembers her mother. She remembers that she was at her happiest when she was helping people. She realizes that she has lost sight of many of her goals in her materialistic luxurious lifestyle. She also realizes this at a fundraising evening in honor of Mother Teresa, one of Alice&#x27;s idols. After the fundraiser, Joe and Alice sleep together. Alice realizes she is falling in love with him.

Alice shares the remaining invisibility herbs with Joe. She hears two of her friends gossiping about her and Joe. The gossip then moves onto Doug, where it is revealed that he has been having affairs, too. Invisible, Alice goes to his office party, where she sees Doug kissing a colleague. Her invisibility wears off and she confronts Doug about his affairs. Alice decides to leave Doug once and for all. She tells this to Joe. However, Joe has decided to reunite with his ex-wife after he spied on her therapy sessions when invisible and realized she still has feelings for him.

Stunned, Alice goes to Dr. Yang, who is leaving town. He gives her one final packet of herbs, telling her that these will create a potent love potion. Alice must choose between Joe and Doug. She goes to her sister Dorothy for advice. However, Dorothy is having a Christmas party, and the herbs get mixed in with the eggnog. All the men in the party become enamored with Alice. She flees in panic.

At home, Alice tells Doug that their marriage is over. She reveals her plans to go to Calcutta and work with Mother Teresa. Doug scoffs at this, doubting that Alice could survive without the luxuries she has grown accustomed to. However, Doug is proved wrong. Alice goes to Calcutta, where she meets Mother Teresa. Upon returning to New York, she moves into a modest apartment, raises the children on her own, and does volunteer work in her spare time.

==Cast==
==Production==
Allen came up with the idea for the film after having alternative treatment for a stye in his eye. The original title was &quot;The Magical Herbs of Dr. Yang&quot;, and it was filmed in late 1989. It was a difficult shoot, with Farrow raising her young children while filming and Allen obsessing over details; some scenes were reshot until he was satisfied. Allen later checked into a hospital by the end of the shoot, suffering from the stress.

This was Keye Luke&#x27;s final film, as he died just under three weeks following the film&#x27;s release.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Alice&quot; was a disappointment at the North American box office; the film grossed a domestic total of $7,331,647 on an estimated $12 million budget.

===Critical reception===
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote: &quot;&quot;Alice&quot; is about one woman&#x27;s tempest-tossed, giddy, herb-induced voyage of self-discovery. It is north-of-the-border magical realism—Alice flies, she becomes invisible, she is another person. It is hilarious and romantic, serious and exuberantly satiric.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of .

<text>Jabalpur, formerly Jubbulpore, is a city situated on the banks of Narmada River in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is the 3rd-largest urban agglomeration of the state and the 38th-largest of the country. Jabalpur is the administrative headquarters of the Jabalpur district and the Jabalpur division. It is the judicial capital of Madhya Pradesh with Madhya Pradesh High Court being located in the city. It is generally accepted that the game of snooker originated in Jabalpur. Jabalpur is also the railway headquarters of the West Central Railway. Jabalpur Cantonment is one of the largest cantonments in India and houses the army headquarters of five states (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand). The city is known for the marble rocks on the river Narmada at Bhedaghat. It is also known as &#x27;Sanskardhani&#x27; meaning &#x27;The Cultural Capital&#x27; highlighting the city&#x27;s rich cultural and historical heritage. The city of Jabalpur was among the first 7 smart cities selected for the Smart Cities Mission.

== Etymology ==
According to a prevalent theory, Jabalpur was named after a sage named Jabali, who meditated on the banks of the Narmada river. Another theory suggests an Arabic origin of the word since () in Arabic means granite boulders or huge boulders, which were common in the region. According to a fringe theory, the name refers to &quot;Jauli Pattala&quot;, a sub-divisional unit, mentioned in Kalachuri inscriptions. Jauli also refers to the Huna queen of the Kalachuri king, Karna. It was spelled as &quot;Jubbulpore&quot; during British rule

In 2006, the Jabalpur Municipal Corporation renamed the city to Jabalpur.

== History ==
Mythology describes three Asuras (evil spirits) in the Jabalpur region, who were defeated by the Hindu god Shiva. Tripurasura being the main asura, gave the city its &quot;puranic&quot; name Tripur Tirth. Tripuri region corresponds to the ancient Chedi Kingdom of Mahabharata times, to which king Shishupala belongs.

Ashokan relics dating to 300 BCE have been found in Rupnath, north of the city, indicating the presence of the Mauryan Empire (322 to 185 BCE) in the region. When the empire fell, Jabalpur became a city-state before coming under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty (230 BCE to 220 CE). After their reign, the region was ruled locally by the Bodhis and the Senas, following which it became a vassal state of the Gupta Empire (320 to 550).

The region was conquered by the Kalachuri Dynasty in 875 CE. The best known Kalachuri ruler was Yuvaraja-Deva I ( 915–945), who married Nohla Devi (a princess of the Chalukya dynasty). One of the Kalachuri ministers, Golok Simha Kayastha, was instrumental in founding the Chausath Yogini Temple near Bhedaghat. His descendants include Bhoj Simha, who was the Dewan to the Gond king Sangram Shah (1491–1543); Dewan Aadhar Singh Kayastha, who was the prime minister to Rani Durgavati (r. 1550–1564), and Beohar Raghuvir Sinha, the last Jagirdar of Jabalpur who reigned until 1947.

=== Gondwana rule ===

Jabalpur was an important centre of power during the rule of the Gond kings of Garha-Mandla.
The ruler of Garha-Mandla, Madan Shah, (1138–1157) built a watchtower and a small hilltop fort at Madan Mahal, an area in Jabalpur. In the 1500s, the Gond king, Sangram Shah held Singorgarh fort. Rani Durgawati was a princess of the Chandela Dynasty who was married to Dalpat Shah of the Gond dynasty. She was well aware of the importance of water conservation, and hence she built more than 85 ponds in Jabalpur, mainly in Ranital, Haathital, Madhatal and Hanumantal.

The Gond king, Hriday Shah (1634-1668), moved his court to the Mandla fort. He secured water sources and built irrigation structures. The kingdom was invaded in 1742 by the Maratha peshwa (prime minister), Balaji Baji Rao along with Visaji Chandorkar, the Maratha governor of Sagar, and made a tributary state of the Maratha Empire.

=== Maratha rule ===
The Maratha rulers of Sagar finally annexed the weakened Garha Kingdom in 1781. Around 1798, the Maratha Peshwa gave the Nerbuddah valley to the Bhonsle kings of Nagpur, who ruled the area until 1818, when it was seized by the British East India Company after the Battle of Sitabuldi.

=== British rule ===
The British made Jabalpur the commission headquarters of the Narmada territories and established a cantonment here. Under the British Raj, Jabalpur became the capital of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, which was part of the British North-Western Province. The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories became part of the new Central Provinces in 1861 which in 1903 became the Central Provinces and Berar. By the early 20th Century Jabalpur was the headquarters of a brigade in the 5th division of the Southern Army.

A significant event was the Tripuri Congress session in 1939, led by Subhash Chandra Bose. Under the guidance of Lokmanya Tilak, the Flag Satyagraha was successfully launched. Mahatma Gandhi visited Jabalpur four times. The Congress session in 1939, where Subhash Chandra Bose was elected president against Gandhi&#x27;s wishes, was notable for its debates on strategies for India&#x27;s independence. A memorial gate, Kamania Gate, was built in the city to commemorate these events.

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the Central Provinces and Berar became the state of Madhya Pradesh.

Under British rule, and among others in the works of Kipling, the city name was spelled &quot;Jubbulpore&quot;.

The city&#x27;s institutional buildings still showcase the British colonial architecture.

<doc id="473228" wikidata="Q1087628" url="?curid=473228" title="Ode on a Grecian Urn">
<text>&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; is a poem written by the English Romantic poet John Keats in May 1819, first published anonymously in &quot;Annals of the Fine Arts for 1819&quot; (see 1820 in poetry)&quot;.&quot;

The poem is one of the &quot;Great Odes of 1819&quot;, which also include &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. Keats found existing forms in poetry unsatisfactory for his purpose, and in this collection he presented a new development of the ode form. He was inspired to write the poem after reading two articles by English artist and writer Benjamin Haydon. Through his awareness of other writings in this field and his first-hand acquaintance with the Elgin Marbles, Keats perceived the idealism and representation of Greek virtues in classical Greek art, and his poem draws upon these insights.

In five stanzas of ten lines each, the poet addresses an ancient Greek urn, describing and discoursing upon the images depicted on it. In particular he reflects upon two scenes, one in which a lover pursues his beloved, and another where villagers and a priest gather to perform a sacrifice. The poet concludes that the urn will say to future generations of mankind: Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty.&#x27; – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot;. Critics have debated whether these lines adequately perfect the conception of the poem. Critics have also focused on the role of the speaker, the power of material objects to inspire, and the paradoxical interrelation between the worldly and the ideal reality in the poem.

&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; was not well received by contemporary critics. It was only by the mid-19th century that it began to be praised, and it is now considered to be one of the greatest odes in the English language. A long debate over the poem&#x27;s final statement divided 20th-century critics, but most agreed on the beauty of the work, despite certain perceived inadequacies.

==Background==
By the spring of 1819, Keats had left his job as assistant house surgeon (where he dressed wounds), at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Southwark, London, to devote himself entirely to the composition of poetry. Living with his friend Charles Brown, the 23-year-old was burdened with money problems and despaired when his brother George sought his financial assistance. These real-world difficulties may have given Keats pause for thought about a career in poetry, yet he did manage to complete five odes, including &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, and &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;. The poems were transcribed by Brown, who later provided copies to the publisher Richard Woodhouse. Their exact date of composition is unknown; Keats simply dated &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; May 1819, as he did its companion odes. While the five poems display a unity in stanza forms and themes, the unity fails to provide clear evidence of the order in which they were composed.

In the odes of 1819, Keats explores his contemplations about relationships between the soul, eternity, nature, and art. His idea of using classical Greek art as a metaphor originated in his reading of Haydon&#x27;s &quot;Examiner&quot; articles of 2 May and 9 May 1819. In the first article, Haydon described Greek sacrifice and worship, and in the second article, he contrasted the artistic styles of Raphael and Michelangelo in conjunction with a discussion of medieval sculptures. Keats also had access to prints of Greek urns at Haydon&#x27;s office, and he traced an engraving of the Sosibios Vase, a Neo-Attic marble volute krater, signed by Sosibios, in The Louvre, which he found in Henry Moses&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Antique Vases, Altars, Paterae&quot;.

Keats&#x27;s inspiration for the topic was not limited to Haydon, but embraced many contemporary sources. He may have recalled his experience with the Elgin Marbles and their influence on his sonnet &quot;On Seeing the Elgin Marbles&quot;. Keats was also exposed to the Townley, Borghese, and Holland House vases and to the classical treatment of subjects in Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. Many contemporary essays and articles on these works shared Keats&#x27;s view that classical Greek art was both idealistic and captured Greek virtues. Although he was influenced by examples of existing Greek vases, in the poem he attempted to describe an ideal artistic type, rather than a specific original vase.

Although &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; was completed in May 1819, its first printing came in January 1820 when it was published with &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; in the &quot;Annals of Fine Art&quot;, an art magazine that promoted views on art similar to those Keats held. Following the initial publication, the &quot;Examiner&quot; published Keats&#x27;s ode together with Haydon&#x27;s two previously published articles. Keats also included the poem in his 1820 collection &quot;Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes, and Other Poems&quot;.

==Structure==
In 1819, Keats had attempted to write sonnets, but found that the form did not satisfy his purpose because the pattern of rhyme worked against the tone that he wished to achieve. When he turned to the ode form, he found that the standard Pindaric form used by poets such as John Dryden was inadequate for properly discussing philosophy. Keats developed his own type of ode in &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, which preceded &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; and other odes he wrote in 1819. Keats&#x27;s creation established a new poetic tone that accorded with his aesthetic ideas about poetry. He further altered this new form in &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; by adding a secondary voice within the ode, creating a dialogue between two subjects. The technique of the poem is ekphrasis, the poetic representation of a painting or sculpture in words. Keats broke from the traditional use of ekphrasis found in Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Idyll&quot;, a classical poem that describes a design on the sides of a cup. While Theocritus describes both motion found in a stationary artwork and underlying motives of characters, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; replaces actions with a series of questions and focuses only on external attributes of the characters.

&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; is organized into ten-line stanzas, beginning with an ABAB rhyme scheme and ending with a Miltonic sestet (1st and 5th stanzas CDEDCE; 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stanzas CDECDE). The same overall pattern is used in &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, and &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; (though their sestet rhyme schemes vary), which makes the poems unified in structure as well as theme. The word &quot;ode&quot; itself is of Greek origin, meaning &quot;sung&quot;. While ode-writers from antiquity adhered to rigid patterns of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, the form by Keats&#x27;s time had undergone enough transformation that it represented a manner rather than a set method for writing a certain type of lyric poetry. Keats&#x27;s odes seek to find a &quot;classical balance&quot; between two extremes, and in the structure of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, these extremes are the symmetrical structure of classical literature and the asymmetry of Romantic poetry. The use of the ABAB structure in the beginning lines of each stanza represents a clear example of structure found in classical literature, and the remaining six lines appear to break free of the traditional poetic styles of Greek and Roman odes.

Keats&#x27;s metre reflects a conscious development in his poetic style. The poem contains only a single instance of medial inversion (the reversal of an iamb in the middle of a line), which was common in his earlier works. However, Keats incorporates spondees in 37 of the 250 metrical feet. Caesurae are never placed before the fourth syllable in a line. The word choice represents a shift from Keats&#x27;s early reliance on Latinate polysyllabic words to shorter, Germanic words. In the second stanza, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, which emphasizes words containing the letters &quot;p&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;v&quot;, uses syzygy, the repetition of a consonantal sound. The poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance, which is found in very few English poems. Within &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, an example of this pattern can be found in line 13 (&quot;Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear&#x27;d&quot;) where the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;sensual&quot; connects with the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;endear&#x27;d&quot; and the &quot;ea&quot; of &quot;ear&quot; connects with the &quot;ea&quot; of &quot;endear&#x27;d&quot;.

==Poem==
The poem begins with the narrator&#x27;s silencing the urn by describing it as the &quot;bride of quietness&quot;, which allows him to speak for it using his own impressions. The narrator addresses the urn by saying:

The urn is a &quot;foster-child of silence and slow time&quot; because it was created from stone and made by the hand of an artist who did not communicate through words. As stone, time has little effect on it and ageing is such a slow process that it can be seen as an eternal piece of artwork. The urn is an external object capable of producing a story outside the time of its creation, and because of this ability the poet labels it a &quot;sylvan historian&quot; that tells its story through its beauty:

The questions presented in these lines are too ambiguous to allow the reader to understand what is taking place in the images on the urn, but elements of it are revealed: there is a pursuit with a strong sexual component. The melody accompanying the pursuit is intensified in the second stanza:

There is a hint of a paradox in that indulgence causes someone to be filled with desire and that music without a sound is desired by the soul. There is a stasis that prohibits the characters on the urn from ever being fulfilled:
In the third stanza, the narrator begins by speaking to a tree, which will ever hold its leaves and will not &quot;bid the Spring adieu&quot;. The paradox of life versus lifelessness extends beyond the lover and the fair lady and takes a more temporal shape as three of the ten lines begin with the words &quot;for ever&quot;. The unheard song never ages and the pipes are able to play forever, which leads the lovers, nature, and all involved to be:


A new paradox arises in these lines because these immortal lovers are experiencing a living death. To overcome this paradox of merged life and death, the poem shifts to a new scene with a new perspective. The fourth stanza opens with the sacrifice of a virgin cow, an image that appeared in the Elgin Marbles, Claude Lorrain&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifice to Apollo&quot;, and Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The Sacrifice at Lystra&quot;
All that exists in the scene is a procession of individuals, and the narrator conjectures on the rest. The altar and town exist as part of a world outside art, and the poem challenges the limitations of art through describing their possible existence. The questions are unanswered because there is no one who can ever know the true answers, as the locations are not real. The final stanza begins with a reminder that the urn is a piece of eternal artwork:
The audience is limited in its ability to comprehend the eternal scene, but the silent urn is still able to speak to them. The story it tells is both cold and passionate, and it is able to help mankind. The poem concludes with the urn&#x27;s message:
==Themes==

Like many of Keats&#x27;s odes, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; discusses art and art&#x27;s audience. He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems, and works such as &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual. Keats reverses this when describing an urn within &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; to focus on representational art. He previously used the image of an urn in &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot;, depicting one with three figures representing Love, Ambition and Poesy. Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of &quot;Truth&quot;. The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem&#x27;s final lines: &quot;&#x27;Beauty is truth, truth beauty,&#x27; – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.&quot; The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.

As a symbol, an urn cannot completely represent poetry, but it does serve as one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and the silence of the urn reinforces the imagination&#x27;s ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called &quot;ut pictura poesis&quot; – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures in a manner similar to &quot;Ode on Indolence&quot; and &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;. The figures on the urn within &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term &quot;Truth&quot;. The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;. Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.

The two contradictory responses found in the first and second scenes of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; are inadequate for completely describing art, because Keats believed that art should not provide history or ideals. Instead, both are replaced with a philosophical tone that dominates the meditation on art. The sensual aspects are replaced with an emphasis on the spiritual aspects, and the last scene describes a world contained unto itself. The relationship between the audience with the world is for benefiting or educating, but merely to emphatically connect to the scene. In the scene, the narrator contemplates where the boundaries of art lie and how much an artist can represent on an urn. The questions the narrator asks reveal a yearning to understand the scene, but the urn is too limited to allow such answers. Furthermore, the narrator is able to visualise more than what actually exists on the urn. This conclusion on art is both satisfying, in that it allows the audience to actually connect with the art, and alienating, as it does not provide the audience the benefit of instruction or narcissistic fulfilment. Besides the contradictions between the various desires within the poem, there are other paradoxes that emerge as the narrator compares his world with that of the figures on the urn. In the opening line, he refers to the urn as a &quot;bride of quietness&quot;, which serves to contrast the urn with the structure of the ode, a type of poem originally intended to be sung. Another paradox arises when the narrator describes immortals on the side of an urn meant to carry the ashes of the dead.

In terms of the actual figures upon the urn, the image of the lovers depicts the relationship of passion and beauty with art. In &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, Keats describes how beauty is temporary. However, the figures of the urn are able to always enjoy their beauty and passion because of their artistic permanence. The urn&#x27;s description as a bride invokes a possibility of consummation, which is symbolic of the urn&#x27;s need for an audience. Charles Patterson, in a 1954 essay, explains that &quot;It is erroneous to assume that here Keats is merely disparaging the bride of flesh wed to man and glorifying the bride of marble wed to quietness. He could have achieved that simple effect more deftly with some other image than the richly ambivalent &quot;unravished bride&quot;, which conveys ... a hint of disparagement: It is natural for brides to be possessed physically ... it is unnatural for them not to be.&quot; John Jones, in his 1969 analysis, emphasises this sexual dimension within the poem by comparing the relationship between &quot;the Eve Adam dreamed of and who was there when he woke up&quot; and the &quot;bridal urn&quot; of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;. Helen Vendler expands on the idea, in her 1983 analysis of Keats&#x27;s odes, when she claimed &quot;the complex mind writing the &quot;Urn&quot; connects stillness and quietness to ravishment and a bride&quot;. In the second stanza, Keats &quot;voices the generating motive of the poem – the necessary self-exhaustion and self-perpetuation of sexual appetite.&quot; To Vendler, desire and longing could be the source of artistic creativity, but the urn contains two contradicting expressions of sexuality: a lover chasing after a beloved and a lover with his beloved. This contradiction reveals Keats&#x27;s belief that such love in general was unattainable and that &quot;The true opponent to the urn-experience of love is not satisfaction but extinction.&quot;

==Critical response==
The first response to the poem came in an anonymous review in the July 1820 &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, which claimed, &quot;Mr Keats displays no great nicety in his selection of images. According to the tenets of that school of poetry to which he belongs, he thinks that any thing or object in nature is a fit material on which the poet may work ... Can there be a more pointed &quot;concetto&quot; than this address to the Piping Shepherds on a Grecian Urn?&quot; Another anonymous review followed in the 29 July 1820 &quot;Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review&quot; that quoted the poem with a note that said that &quot;Among the minor poems, many of which possess considerable merit, the following appears to be the best&quot;. Josiah Conder, in a September 1820 &quot;Eclectic Review&quot;, argues that:
Mr Keats, seemingly, can think or write of scarcely any thing else than the &#x27;happy pieties&#x27; of Paganism. A Grecian Urn throws him into an ecstasy: its &#x27;silent form,&#x27; he says, &#x27;doth tease us out of thought as doth Eternity,&#x27;—a very happy description of the bewildering effect which such subjects have at least had upon his own mind; and his fancy having thus got the better of his reason, we are the less surprised at the oracle which the Urn is made to utter:
&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;Beauty is truth, truth beauty,&#x27;—that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
&lt;/poem&gt;
That is, all that Mr Keats knows or cares to know.—But till he knows much more than this, he will never write verses fit to live.

George Gilfillan, in an 1845 essay on Keats, placed the poem among &quot;The finest of Keats&#x27; smaller pieces&quot; and suggested that &quot;In originality, Keats has seldom been surpassed. His works &#x27;rise like an exhalation.&#x27; His language has been formed on a false system; but, ere he died, was clarifying itself from its more glaring faults, and becoming copious clear, and select. He seems to have been averse to all speculative thought, and his only creed, we fear, was expressed in the words— Beauty is truth,—truth beauty&quot;. The 1857 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; contained an article on Keats by Alexander Smith, which stated: &quot;Perhaps the most exquisite specimen of Keats&#x27; poetry is the &#x27;Ode to the Grecian Urn&#x27;; it breathes the very spirit of antiquity,—eternal beauty and eternal repose.&quot; During the mid-19th century, Matthew Arnold claimed that the passage describing the little town &quot;is Greek, as Greek as a thing from Homer or Theocritus; it is composed with the eye on the object, a radiancy and light clearness being added.&quot;

===&#x27;Beauty is truth&#x27; debate===
The 20th century marked the beginning of a critical dispute over the final lines of the poem and their relationship to the beauty of the whole work. Poet laureate Robert Bridges sparked the debate when he argued:
The thought as enounced in the first stanza is the supremacy of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered ... which gives an effect of poverty in spite of the beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.
Bridges believed that the final lines redeemed an otherwise bad poem. Arthur Quiller-Couch responded with a contrary view and claimed that the lines were &quot;a vague observation – to anyone whom life has taught to face facts and define his terms, actually an &quot;uneducated&quot; conclusion, albeit most pardonable in one so young and ardent.&quot; The debate expanded when I. A. Richards, an English literary critic who analysed Keats&#x27;s poems in 1929, relied on the final lines of the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; to discuss &quot;pseudo-statements&quot; in poetry:
On the one hand there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its statements seriously – and find them silly ... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand there are those who succeed too well, who swallow &#x27;Beauty is truth, truth beauty ...,&#x27; as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness as a result of their linguistic naivety.
Poet and critic T. S. Eliot, in his 1929 &quot;Dante&quot; essay, responded to Richards:
I am at first inclined to agree ... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line strikes me as a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement ... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps the fact that it is grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.
In 1930, John Middleton Murry gave a history of these responses &quot;to show the astonishing variety of opinion which exists at this day concerning the culmination of a poem whose beauty has been acknowledged for many years. Whether such another cause, and such another example, of critical diversity exists, I cannot say; if it does, it is unknown to me. My own opinion concerning the value of those two lines &quot;in the context of the poem itself&quot; is not very different from Mr. Eliot&#x27;s.&quot;

Cleanth Brooks defended the lines from critics in 1947 and argued:
We shall not feel that the generalization, unqualified and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context to compete with the scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. &#x27;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&#x27; has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare&#x27;s &#x27;Ripeness is all.&#x27; It is a speech &#x27;in character&#x27; and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats&#x27;s little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.
M. H. Abrams responded to Brooks&#x27;s view in 1957:
I entirely agree, then, with Professor Brooks in his explication of the &quot;Ode&quot;, that &#x27;Beauty is truth&#x27; ... is to be considered as a speech &#x27;in character&#x27; and &#x27;dramatically appropriate&#x27; to the Urn. I am uneasy, however, about his final reference to &#x27;the world-view ...&#x27; For the poem as a whole is equally an utterance by a dramatically presented speaker, and none of its statements is proffered for our endorsement as a philosophical generalization of unlimited scope. They are all, therefore, to be apprehended as histrionic elements which are &#x27;in character&#x27; and &#x27;dramatically appropriate,&#x27; for their inherent interest as stages in the evolution of an artistically ordered ... experience of a credible human being.
Earl Wasserman, in 1953, continued the discussion over the final lines and claimed, &quot;the more we tug at the final lines of the ode, the more the noose of their meaning strangles our comprehension of the poem ... The aphorism is all the more beguiling because it appears near the end of the poem, for its apparently climactic position has generally led to the assumption that it is the abstract summation of the poem ... But the ode is not an abstract statement or an excursion into philosophy. It is a poem about things&quot;.

Walter Evert, discussing the debate in 1965, justified the final lines of the poem to declare &quot;The poem, then, accepts the urn for the immediate meditative imaginative pleasure that it can give, but it firmly defines the limits of artistic truth. In this it is wholly consistent with all the great poetry of Keats&#x27;s last creative period.&quot; Hugh Kenner, in 1971, explained that Keats &quot;interrogates an urn, and answers for it, and its last answer, about Beauty and Truth, may seem almost intolerably enigmatic&quot;. To Kenner, the problem with Keats&#x27;s Beauty and Truth statement arises out of the reader&#x27;s inability to distinguish between the poet, his reflections on the urn, and any possible statement made by the urn. He concluded that Keats fails to provide his narrator with enough characterization to be able to speak for the urn. Charles Rzepka, in 1986, offered his view on the matter: &quot;The truth-beauty equation at the end of the &#x27;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#x27; offers solace but is finally no more convincing than the experience it describes is durable.&quot; Rick Rylance picked up the debate again in 1990 and explained that the true meaning of the final lines cannot be discerned merely by studying the language. This posed a problem for the New Critics, who were prone to closely reading a poem&#x27;s text.

===Later responses===
Not every 20th-century critic opined primarily on the quality of the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that &quot;while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;.&quot; In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: &quot;Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go ... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe &#x27;Cold Pastoral&#x27; [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean.&quot; In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a &quot;tense ethereal beauty&quot; with a &quot;touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency&quot; of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, &quot;as in the &quot;Ode to Maia&quot;, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh.&quot;

In 1954, Charles Patterson defended the poem and claimed, &quot;The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats&#x27;s great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of &quot;To Autumn&quot; but is much superior in these qualities to the &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom.&quot; Walter Jackson Bate argued in 1962 that &quot;the &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; possesses a quiet and constrained composure hardly equaled by the other odes of this month and perhaps even unsurpassed by the ode &quot;To Autumn&quot; of the following September ... there is a severe repose about the &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;; it is both &#x27;interwoven&#x27; and &#x27;complete&#x27;; and within its tensely braced stanzas is a potential energy momentarily stilled and imprisoned.&quot; In 1964, literary critic David Perkins claimed in his essay &quot;The Ode on a Nightingale&quot; that the symbol of the urn &quot;may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry ... but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions&quot;.

F. W. Bateson emphasized in 1966 the poem&#x27;s ability to capture truth: &quot;The &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; had ended with the explicit admission that the &#x27;fancy&#x27; is a &#x27;cheat,&#x27; and the &quot;Grecian Urn&quot; concludes with a similar repudiation. But this time it is a positive instead of a negative conclusion. There &quot;is&quot; no escape from the &#x27;woe&#x27; that &#x27;shall this generation waste,&#x27; but the action of time can be confronted and seen in its proper proportions. To enable its readers to do this is the special function of poetry.&quot; Ronald Sharp followed in 1979 with a claim that the theme of &quot;the relationship between life and art ... receives its most famous, and its most enigmatic and controversial, treatment&quot; within the poem. In 1983, Vendler praised many of the passages within the poem but argued that the poem was unable to fully represent what Keats wanted: &quot;The simple movement of entrance and exit, even in its triple repetition in the &quot;Urn&quot;, is simply not structurally complex enough to be adequate, as a representational form, to what we know of aesthetic experience – or indeed to human experience generally.&quot; Later in 1989, Daniel Watkins claimed the poem as &quot;one of [Keats&#x27;s] most beautiful and problematic works.&quot;

Andrew Bennett, in 1994, discussed the poem&#x27;s effectiveness: &quot;What is important and compelling in this poem is not so much what happens on the urn or in the poem, but the way that a response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response&quot;. In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem &quot;tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration.&quot; Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; because it &quot;turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the &#x27;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#x27; drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of &#x27;idylls&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Brian Behlendorf (born March 30, 1973) is an American technologist, executive, computer programmer and leading figure in the open-source software movement. He was a primary developer of the Apache Web server, the most popular web server software on the Internet, and a founding member of the Apache Group, which later became the Apache Software Foundation. Behlendorf served as president of the foundation for three years. He has served on the board of the Mozilla Foundation since 2003, Benetech since 2009, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation since 2013. Behlendorf served as the General Manager of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) from 2021 to 2023 and is currently the Chief Technology Officer of the OpenSSF.

== Career ==
Behlendorf, raised in Southern California, became interested in the development of the Internet while he was a student at the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1990s. One of his first projects was an electronic mailing list and online music resource, SFRaves, which a friend persuaded him to start in 1992. This would soon develop into the Hyperreal.org website, an online resource devoted to electronic music and related subcultures.

In 1993, Behlendorf, Jonathan Nelson, Matthew Nelson and Cliff Skolnick co-founded Organic, Inc., the first business dedicated to building commercial web sites. While developing the first online, for-profit, media project—the HotWired web site for &quot;Wired&quot; magazine—in 1994, they realized that the most commonly used web server software at the time (developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) could not handle the user registration system that the company required. So, Behlendorf patched the open-source code to support HotWired&#x27;s requirements.

It turned out that Behlendorf wasn&#x27;t the only one busy patching the NCSA code at the time, so he and Skolnick put together an electronic mailing list to coordinate the work of the other programmers. By the end of February 1995, eight core contributors to the project started Apache as a fork of the NCSA codebase. Working loosely together, they eventually rewrote the entire original program as the Apache HTTP Server. In 1999, the project incorporated as the Apache Software Foundation. Behlendorf served as president of the Foundation for three years.

Behlendorf was the CTO of the World Economic Forum. He is also a former director and CTO of CollabNet, a company he co-founded with O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates (now O&#x27;Reilly Media) in 1999 to develop tools for enabling collaborative distributed software development. CollabNet used to be the primary corporate sponsor of the open source version control system Subversion, before it became a project of the Apache Software Foundation. He continues to be involved with electronic music community events such as Chillits, and speaks often at open-source conferences worldwide.

In 2003, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

Behlendorf has served on the board of the Mozilla Foundation since 2003, Benetech since 2009 and the Electronic Frontier Foundation since 2013. He was a managing director at Peter Thiel&#x27;s Mithril Capital, a global technology investment firm based in San Francisco, from 2014 until he joined the Linux Foundation. In 2016, he was appointed executive director of the open source Hyperledger project at the Linux Foundation to advance blockchain technology. 

Behlendorf became the General Manager of the Open Source Security Foundation in October 2021. The appointment was shared publicly at KubeCon, along with the announcement of $10m in investments to secure open source supply chains.

<doc id="473238" wikidata="Q1444922" url="?curid=473238" title="Runtime library">
<text>A runtime library is a library that provides access to the runtime environment that is available to a computer program tailored to the host platform. A runtime environment implements the execution model as required for a development environment such as a particular programming language. A runtime library may provide basic program facilities such as for memory management and exception handling.

A runtime library is an artifact of the design of the toolchain used to build the program not inherently required by the host operating system or the programming language in which the program is written. The toolset is designed to abstract aspects of the host platform often to simplify tool development. The toolchain builds a program to depend on a runtime library and to use it while the program is running at program run-time. 

The runtime library may directly implement runtime behavior, but often it is a thin wrapper on top of operating system facilities. For example, some language features that can be performed only (or are more efficient or accurate) at runtime are implemented in the runtime environment and may be invoked via the runtime library API, e.g. some logic errors, array bounds checking, dynamic type checking, exception handling, and possibly debugging functionality. For this reason, some programming bugs are not discovered until the program is tested in a &quot;live&quot; environment with real data, despite sophisticated compile-time checking and testing performed during development.

As another example, a runtime library may contain code of built-in low-level operations too complicated for their inlining during compilation, such as implementations of arithmetic operations not directly supported by the targeted CPU, or various miscellaneous compiler-specific operations and directives.

The runtime library is often confused with the language standard library which implements functionality as defined by a language. A standard library could be implemented in a platform-specific way or it could leverage a runtime library to be platform independent. For example, the C standard library is relatively large while the platform-specific runtime library (commonly called codice_1) is relatively small which eases supporting multiple platforms.

<text>John R. Mashey (born 1946) is an American computer scientist, director and entrepreneur. He is a consultant for Techviser, a boutique consulting firm.

==Career==
Mashey holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Pennsylvania State University, where he developed the ASSIST assembler language teaching software. He worked on the PWB/UNIX operating system at Bell Labs from 1973 to 1983, authoring the PWB shell, also known as the &quot;Mashey Shell&quot;. He then moved to Silicon Valley to join Convergent Technologies, ending as director of software. He joined MIPS Computer Systems in early 1985, managing operating systems development, and helping design the MIPS RISC architecture, as well as specific CPUs, systems and software. He continued similar work at Silicon Graphics (1992–2000), contributing to the design of the NUMAflex modular computer architecture using NUMAlink, ending as VP and chief scientist.

Mashey was one of the founders of the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) benchmarking group, was an ACM National Lecturer for four years, has been guest editor for &quot;IEEE Micro&quot;, and one of the long-time organizers of the Hot Chips conferences. He chaired technical conferences on operating systems and CPU chips, and gave public talks on software engineering, RISC design, performance benchmarking and supercomputing. He has been credited for being the first to spread the term and concept of big data in the 1990s. He became a consultant for venture capitalists and high-tech companies and a trustee of the Computer History Museum in 2001. In 1997 he received Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s first Outstanding Engineering Alumni Award for Computer Science and Engineering. In 2012, he received the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;Flame Award&quot;) &quot;for his contributions to the UNIX community since its early days&quot;.

He has written articles for the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; 
regarding climate change denial.
In 2010 he published a 250-page critical report on the Wegman Report.
Mashey&#x27;s report concluded that the Wegman Report contained plagiarized text.
This story was featured in &quot;USA Today&quot;, and he was interviewed in &quot;Science&quot; magazine, which stated that he was &quot;spending his retirement years compiling voluminous critiques of what he calls the &#x27;real conspiracy&#x27; to produce &#x27;climate antiscience&#x27;.&quot;
His research has investigated the secretive funding of climate contrarian thinktanks. Mashey blogs at DeSmogBlog, which focuses on global warming.

Mashey became a scientific and technical consultant for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 2015.

== Personal life ==
Mashey is married to Angela Hey, a Cambridge University and Waterloo University graduate with a Ph.D. from Imperial College, London.

<text>ASSIST (the Assembler System for Student Instruction and Systems Teaching) is an IBM System/370-compatible assembler and interpreter developed in the early 1970s at Penn State University by Graham Campbell and John Mashey along with student assistants.

In the late 1960s, computer science education expanded rapidly and university computer centers were faced with a large growth in usage by students, whose needs sometimes differed from professionals in batch processing environments. They needed to run short programs on decks of Punched cards with fast turnaround (minutes, not overnight) as their programs more often included syntax errors. Once they compiled, they would often fault quickly, so optimization and flexibility were far less important than low overhead.

WATFIV was a successful pioneering effort to build a FORTRAN compiler tuned for student use. Universities began running it in a dedicated &quot;fast-batch&quot; memory partition with a small run-time limit, such as 5 seconds on an IBM System/360 Model 67). The low limit enabled fast turnaround and avoided waste of time by programs stuck in infinite loops. WATFIV&#x27;s success helped inspire development of ASSIST, PL/C and other student-oriented programs that fit the &quot;fast-batch&quot; model that became widely used among universities.

ASSIST was enhanced and promoted by others, such as Northern Illinois University&#x27;s Wilson Singletary &amp; Ross Overbeek and 
University of Tennessee&#x27;s Charles Hughes and Charles Pfleeger who reported in 1978 that ASSIST was being used in 200+ universities.

In the 1980s, NIU did a new implementation on IBM PCs, ASSIST/I (Interactive), used by computer scientist John Ehrman to teach a &quot;boot camp&quot; course in assembly programming at SHARE (computing) meetings, at least through 2011, but perhaps for several years after.

On March 1, 1998, Penn State declared that ASSIST was no longer copyrighted and that the program was freely available as per the last release notes.

The original ASSIST code seems to still get some use, as seen in 2017 demonstration video assembling its source and running it in MVS 3.8 emulation on a laptop. IBM System/360 and /370 computers used 24-bit addressing and ignored the high-order 8 bits. Assembly programmers of the era, including those who wrote ASSIST, often saved precious memory by using the high-order 8 bits for flags, which required a compatibility mode when IBM introduced 31-bit and then 64-bit addressing.

<text>Anna and the King is a 1999 American biographical period drama film directed by Andy Tennant. Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes loosely based their screenplay on the 1944 novel &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, which gives a fictionalized account of the diaries of Anna Leonowens. It stars Jodie Foster as Leonowens, an English school teacher in Siam during the late 19th century, who becomes the teacher of King Mongkut&#x27;s (Chow Yun-fat) many children and wives. It was mostly shot in Malaysia, particularly in the Penang, Ipoh and Langkawi regions.

&quot;Anna and the King&quot; was released in the United States on December 17, 1999 by 20th Century Fox. The film was subject to controversy when the Thai government deemed it historically inaccurate and insulting to the royal family and banned its distribution in the country. It received mixed reviews from critics who praised the production values, costume design, and musical score but criticised its screenplay and length. The film grossed $114 million worldwide, against its $92 million budget. It received two nominations at the 72nd Academy Awards: Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

==Plot==
Anna Leonowens, a British widow, has come to Siam with her son Louis to teach English to Crown Prince Chulalongkorn, the heir of King Mongkut. She is a strong-willed, intelligent, valiant and benevolent woman for her time, which pleases the King. Mongkut wants to modernize Siam, thinking this will help his country resist colonialism and protect the ancient traditions that provide Siam its identity. For this reason, he has Anna teach all of his dozens of children, born to twenty-three wives.

Initially, Mongkut and Anna clash due to cultural differences as well as their equally strong wills. He soon sees the positive effects of her teaching methods, especially her determination to treat the princes and princesses as though they were ordinary schoolchildren. Anna&#x27;s abolitionist views also help to influence Chulalongkorn&#x27;s views on slavery.

Mongkut and Anna discuss differences between Eastern and Western love, but he dismisses the notion that a man can be happy with only one wife. Hoping to impress Britain&#x27;s ambassadors, Mongkut orders a sumptuous reception and appoints Anna to organize it. During the reception, the King spars graciously and wittily with Sir Mycroft Kincaid, of the East India Company. The Europeans express their beliefs that Siam is a superstitious, backward nation. Anna powerfully argues that this is not the case. Mongkut dances with Anna at the reception.

Siam is under siege from what appears to be a British-funded coup d&#x27;état against King Mongkut, using Burmese soldiers. Mongkut sends his brother Prince Chaofa and military advisor General Alak and their troops to investigate. Alak, however, betrays the prince and poisons his own soldiers, revealing he is actually the coup&#x27;s leader. The king is brought the news that his brother and general are dead.

Anna grows closer to the royal children, particularly Princess Fa-Ying, who adores the playful monkeys who live in the royal garden&#x27;s trees. When Fa-Ying falls sick with cholera, Anna is summoned to her chambers to say goodbye. She gets there just as Fa-Ying dies in King Mongkut&#x27;s arms, and the two mourn together. Mongkut later finds that one of the monkeys &quot;borrowed&quot; his glasses as his daughter used to do. He believes that reincarnation will alleviate his grief, and Fa-Ying might be reborn as one of her beloved animals.

Anna also begins to educate Lady Tuptim, the King&#x27;s newest concubine, who was already in love with another man, Khun Phra Balat, when she was brought to court. Mongkut is kind to her, but Tuptim yearns for her true love. After Balat becomes a Buddhist monk, Tuptim disguises herself as a monk as well so she can join his monastery and be near him. She is tracked down and put on trial, where it is revealed Balat has been viciously tortured. When Tuptim condemns the judges for their cruelty, she is caned.

Anna, unable to bear the sight, speaks out angrily in an attempt to stop the abuse and threatens to go to the king, before she is forcibly removed from the court. Her outburst prevents Mongkut from showing clemency, because he cannot be seen as beholden to her, though he feels ashamed. Tuptim and Balat are beheaded publicly.

Anna resolves to leave Siam as many others are fleeing due to the approaching Burmese army. Sir Mycroft approaches the Siamese prime minister and reveals that in an attempt to protect his interests in Siam, he&#x27;s paid a small fortune to discover who is behind the attempted coup: Alak.

Mongkut&#x27;s army is too far from the palace to engage the rebels, so he creates a ruse - that a white elephant has been spotted, and the court must go to see it. This allows him to flee the palace with his children and wives, and give his armies time to reach them. The prime minister convinces Anna to return and help Mongkut, since her presence in his entourage will corroborate the tale about the white elephant. Mongkut plans to take his family to a monastery where he spent part of his life. Halfway through the journey, they see Alak&#x27;s army in the distance and realize they can&#x27;t outrun him. Mongkut and his soldiers set explosives on a wooden bridge high above a canyon floor as Alak and his army approach. Mongkut orders his &quot;army&quot; to stay back and rides to the bridge with only two soldiers. Alak, at the head of his army, confronts Mongkut on the bridge.

Anna, Louis and Mongkut&#x27;s wives and children create a brilliant deception from their hiding spot in the forest. Louis uses his horn to replicate the sound of a bugle charge, as the others &quot;attack&quot; the area with harmless fireworks. The Burmese, believing the King has brought British soldiers, panic and retreat. Alak&#x27;s attempt to recall and regroup his troops fails. Alak stands alone, but Mongkut refuses to kill him, saying that Alak will have to live with his shame. As Mongkut turns to ride back to Siam, Alak grabs his gun and aims at his back, but one of Mongkut&#x27;s guards detonates the explosives, blowing the bridge and Alak to pieces.

The court returns to Bangkok, where Anna tearfully prepares to leave Siam for good. Mongkut shares one last dance with her, marveling that he now understands how a man could be content with only one woman. A voice-over tells viewers that Chulalongkorn became king after his father&#x27;s death, abolishing slavery and instituting religious freedom with his father&#x27;s &quot;vision&quot; assisting him.

The consensus reads, &quot;Beautiful cinematography can&#x27;t prevent &quot;Anna and the King&quot; from being boring and overly lengthy.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 56 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. On a $92 million budget, the film underperformed in the United States and Canada where it only grossed $39 million, however, it did much better internationally with a gross of $75 million for a worldwide total of $114 million.

==Controversy==
After reviewing the script, with changes having been made to try to satisfy them, the Thai government did not allow the film-makers to film in Thailand. The Thai authorities did not permit the film to be distributed in Thailand due to scenes that they construed as a disrespectful and historically inaccurate depiction of King Mongkut.

Tony Dabbs wrote an opinion piece for the Thai newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;, criticizing the ban, advocating the use of strong disclaimers, and expanding the issue beyond this picture, saying: “Frankly, I would like to see all films that take strong liberties with the historical facts, as &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;JFK&quot; did, also be required to state so at the end of the film”.

<text>The RSD-10 &quot;Pioneer&quot; ( : &quot;raketa sredney dalnosti (RSD) &quot;Pioner&quot;&quot;; ) was an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead, deployed by the Soviet Union from 1976 to 1988. It carried GRAU designation 15Ж45 (&quot;15Zh45&quot;). Its NATO reporting name was SS-20 Saber.

Its deployment was a major cause of NATO&#x27;s &#x27;Double-Track Decision&#x27;, which led to the deployment of more medium-range nuclear weapons in Western Europe. The RSD-10 was withdrawn from service under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

==Specifications==
The missile was high, in diameter and weighed 37.1 tons. It was based on two solid-fuel fiberglass clad stages of the RT-21 Temp 2S (SS-16 &quot;Sinner&quot;), so it was also known as the RT-21M &quot;Pioneer&quot;. The missile&#x27;s range was from initially; the final model had a maximum range of possibly . Initially the missile was fitted with a single 1 megaton, 1.6 ton warhead. Later models could take one or two (and from 1980, three) additional 150 kiloton MIRV devices (Pioneer UTTH). The CEP was also reduced from to . The missile was the first Soviet missile equipped with solid fuel instead of liquid fuel, which meant that it could be launched once the order had been given instead of requiring hours doing the dangerous work of pumping the missile with liquid fuel.

The missile used a MAZ-547A/MAZ-7916 transporter erector launcher (TEL) produced in the Belarusian SSR by the Minsk Automobile Plant. The TEL was originally designed for the RT-21 Temp 2S intercontinental ballistic missile.

On 10 August 1979 testing of the modernized &quot;Pioneer&quot;-UTTKh (15Zh53) began at the Kapustin Yar test site. It continued through 14 August 1980, and on 17 December 1980 the missile was deployed. Designated by NATO as SS-20 Mod3, this variant had the same propulsion system as earlier versions, but due to upgrading of a command structure and instrumentation-service unit it was possible to improve accuracy (CEP) from 550 to 450 meters, to increase maximum range by 10%, and to increase the area covered by the warheads. This latest RSD-10 variant subsequently received NATO reporting name SS-28 Saber 2.

==Development==
It was intended to replace, or augment, the R-12 Dvina (SS-4 &quot;Sandal&quot;) and R-14 Chusovaya (SS-5 &quot;Skean&quot;) missiles deployed from 1958 and 1961 respectively in the USSR and Warsaw Pact states. It entered the development stage in 1966 and a design concept was approved in 1968 with the task given to the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology and Alexander Nadiradze, who also developed the RT-21 Temp 2S in the same period. Flight testing began in 1974 and deployment commenced on 11 March 1976, with the first supplied units becoming operational in August of that year. Up to 1986, a total of 48 launch sites including a site at Pavschino, were equipped with 435 RSD-10 missiles under control of the Strategic Missile Forces.

There were several theories as to why the Soviet Union developed the RSD-10:
* Some in the United States such as Richard Perle saw it as a part of a bid for global power on the part of the Soviet Union.
* Another popular theory held that the SALT treaties, by placing quantitative limits on long-range missiles, had encouraged the Soviets to place more emphasis on medium-range missiles, which were not covered by SALT.
* Another theory held that the RSD-10 was the &quot;son&quot; of the failed RT-21 Temp 2S ICBM project. Following the failure of the RT-21, the Soviets simply used the technology and parts that had been developed for the RT-21 for the RSD-10.
* Others argued that it was part of an attempt on the part of the Soviet military to develop a more sophisticated nuclear strategy that did not call for an all out nuclear first strike as soon as World War III began by giving the Soviets a second strike capability that they had previously lacked.

During the 1960s, Soviet missile procurement was dominated by the ideas of Defence Minister, Marshal Andrei Grechko who was opposed to the idea of nuclear weapons as a weapon of last resort, and planned, if World War III commenced, to begin that conflict with an immediate nuclear strike on the NATO nations. By the early 1970s, Grechko&#x27;s views had caused opposition within the military and the political leadership, who wanted the Soviet Union to have a second strike capacity in order to prevent a war with the United States from going nuclear immediately as Grechko preferred. More importantly, the increasing influence of Marshal Dmitriy Ustinov heralded a shift in Soviet thinking about nuclear weapons. Ustinov was a man closely connected with the various Soviet design bureaus, and who generally sided with demands of the design bureaus against the military regarding weapons procurement. The decision to order and introduce the Pioneer in the mid-1970s was in large part due to Ustinov&#x27;s wishes to shift military procurement out of the hands of the military and into the design bureaus, who in turn pressed for more and varied weapons as a way of increasing orders. The British historian James Cant wrote that it was the triumph of the Soviet version of the military-industrial complex over the military as regarding weapons procurement that was the most important reason for the Pioneer.

==Deployment==

While the Warsaw Pact arguably enjoyed a massive conventional superiority over NATO in Central Europe, Soviet leaders assumed that NATO would use tactical nuclear weapons to stop a massive Warsaw Pact counteroffensive. The RSD-10 provided the Soviet Union with an in-theater &quot;selective&quot; targeting capability that it previously had lacked. The RSD-10 had the capacity to destroy all NATO bases and installations with negligible warning. Thus, the Soviet Union acquired the capability to neutralise NATO&#x27;s tactical nuclear forces with surgical nuclear strikes.

In 1979, when the Soviet Union had 14 (1 operational) RSD-10 launch sites, NATO decided to deploy US Pershing II missiles and BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles in Western Europe in an attempt to counter the RSD-10, known as the NATO Double-Track Decision.

==Decommissioning==

654 missiles were built in total. These and the 499 associated mobile launchers were destroyed by May 1991 in accordance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Fifteen RSD-10, eight BGM-109G Gryphon and seven Pershing II missiles were preserved to commemorate this agreement. One RSD-10 can be seen in the grounds of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, one at the Ukraine Air Force Museum in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, and another is inside the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum at Washington, D.C., US.

North Korea has acquired an unknown number of demilitarized RSD-10 transporter erector launchers from Russia or from Belarus for use with the BM25 Musudan missile.

<text>The Business of Strangers is a 2001 American drama film that tells the story of an eventful night shared between a middle-aged businesswoman and her young assistant. The independent film was written and directed by Patrick Stettner. It stars Stockard Channing and Julia Stiles.

==Plot==
Julie Styron is a middle-aged business woman flying out of town to attend an important meeting. When her CEO contacts her and asks her to meet him for dinner afterward, she worries that her job may be in danger and engages the help of a headhunter named Nick Harris to look for a new position. Her mood worsens when her new assistant Paula Murphy is 45 minutes late to the meeting, which as a result goes badly. After its end, Julie fires Paula and they part ways.

Later that evening Julie is unexpectedly promoted to CEO of the company. After both their flights home are delayed, Julie and Paula meet up by chance in a hotel bar. Julie apologizes for losing her temper earlier and buys Paula a drink. As they talk, Julie, who gave up having a family for her career, begins to question whether she made the right choice. The two of them visit the gym and the pool before returning to the bar.

Nick joins them, explaining that his flight was also canceled. Paula rushes off to the bathroom and is followed by Julie, who wants to know what was wrong. Later, Paula informs her that Nick raped a friend of hers in Boston. Julie is shocked but eventually convinced, and suggests they get revenge. Paula tells her to just forget about it.

The two retire to Julie&#x27;s room, and when Nick knocks on the door later on, Paula invites him in and then drugs him. In order to keep him from realizing what they&#x27;ve done, the two women take him down into a restricted area of the hotel which is being renovated. Julie runs upstairs to get Nick&#x27;s briefcase, and returns to find Paula stripping him. Paula explains that this way when he wakes up he will hesitate to ask anyone what happened.

Paula photographs them all with her Polaroid camera. Paula finds a magic marker and they write words on Nick&#x27;s chest and back like &quot;pig&quot; and &quot;rapist&quot;. They are nearly discovered by a security guard, but he leaves without seeing them. Paula eventually confesses to Julie that it was she who was raped, not her friend — which Julie had already guessed. They return to Julie&#x27;s room and sleep.

The next morning, Julie finds the word &quot;loser&quot; written in marker on her own stomach, and a few Polaroids on the bed of Paula sitting next to her own sleeping form. At the airport she meets up with Nick again. He reveals that he had never been to Boston, proving Paula&#x27;s rape story to be an elaborate lie.

== Cast ==
==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. 
 On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 30 reviews.

Writing for the BBC, Neil Smith compared the film favorably to &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, praising the &quot;insightful script, [...] sleek cinematography, and [...] acerbic one-liners&quot; along with &quot;the inspired pairing of Channing and Stiles [which] creates real dramatic fireworks&quot;.

Conversely, in the &quot;Portland Mercury&quot;, Katia Dunn wrote that while the screenplay is good, &quot;Julia&#x27;s flatness leaks into every part of the movie&quot; and that her &quot;inability to act&quot; single-handedly dooms the film as unlike her two other movies that year, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot;, &quot;there are no dance or sex scenes for Julia to fall back on&quot;, concluding that the film &quot;should be a lesson about what happens when bad actors try to do arty movies: Disaster&quot; and that &quot;Julia Stiles should stick to what she does best: Nothing&quot;.

<doc id="473261" wikidata="Q1691383" url="?curid=473261" title="Joe Dever">
<text>Joseph Robert Dever, also known as Joe Dever (12 February 1956 – 29 November 2016) was an English fantasy author and game designer. Originally a musician, Dever became the first British winner of the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Championship of America in 1982.

He first created the fictional world of Magnamund in 1977 as a setting for his &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaigns. In 1984, he released the first book of the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series of young-adult gamebooks, and the series has since sold over 11.5 million copies worldwide (as of September 2014). He experienced difficulty with his publishers as the game books market began to contract in 1995, until publication ceased in 1998 before the final four books (numbers 29–32) were released. Since 2003, the series enjoyed a revival of interest, particularly in France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Poland following the re-release of the gamebook series in these countries.

From 1996 onwards, Dever had been involved in the design and production of several successful computer and console games. He also contributed to &quot;Lone Wolf: The Roleplaying Game&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-style roleplaying game for Lone Wolf published by Mongoose Publishing (UK) from 2004 to 2013 and Le Grimoire (France) in 2006–2013. In 2013, he wrote the story and in-game text for the &quot;Joe Dever&#x27;s Lone Wolf&quot; video game series specifically designed for tablets and smartphones. Entitled &quot;Lone Wolf: Blood on the Snow&quot;, it was developed by Forge Reply (Milan, Italy) and published by BulkyPix. In February 2014, it won two Golden Dragon Awards from the Italian Video Game Developer&#x27;s Association of Italy (AESVI) for Best Game Design and Best Indie Game of the Year 2013. In April 2014, it was a finalist in the Develop Industry Excellence Awards. On 27 November 2014, it was released via Steam for PC&#x27;s and Mac computers. On 11 January 2016, the developer Forge Reply announced that &quot;Joe Dever&#x27;s Lone Wolf&quot; had achieved 2.5 million downloads since its release in November 2013.

At the time of his death, Dever was authoring supplements for the Lone Wolf Adventure Game with Cubicle 7 Entertainment Ltd., and writing the final books in the core &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series. Following his death, his son Ben announced that his family would work to publish the remaining three books of the saga.

==Biography==
Dever was born in Chingford and educated at Buckhurst Hill County High School. In 1976, he joined the studio-based orchestra of a record company in London known as Pye Records which provided accompaniment to prominent solo singers and artists. After 18 months, the orchestra disbanded and Dever then freelanced for a year before joining Virgin Records as a recording engineer based at Manor Studios in Oxfordshire. Dever has two children, Ben (b. 1981) and Sophie (b. 1987).

Dever was a bass guitar player and attempted to get a record deal when playing with Essex-based band Seventh Seal. This led to him getting involved with John Lydon&#x27;s band Public Image Ltd; Dever acted as the band&#x27;s road manager and tour manager when it toured in Europe.

He was also an enthusiastic wargamer with an extensive collection of both 15mm and 25mm metal miniatures, of which he had painted the vast majority.

During June–August 2005, Dever underwent extensive surgery for bi-lateral kidney cancer, involving a partial nephrectomy of the right kidney, and a full nephrectomy of the left kidney. Seventy percent of his remaining kidney was saved. The surgical team was directed by J. L. Peters of Whipps Cross University Hospital in London. It proceeded without complications on 10 August 2005, and subsequently Dever made a swift recovery, having retained sufficient kidney function to lead a normal life without any need for dialysis.

In August 2016, Dever underwent a bile duct surgery which caused side effects. In late October, he announced his admission to hospital for a series of treatment to correct these complications. He died on 29 November 2016, following those complications.

==Writings==
Joe Dever was seven years old when he became a fan of the comic strip &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire&quot; which appeared in a magazine called &quot;Look and Learn&quot;. He also built up armies of Airfix Roman soldiers and converted their spears to laser rifles long before he was introduced to fantasy. Dever was first introduced to &quot;science fantasy&quot; in 1970 by his Grammar school English tutor. He was the first and perhaps only British person to compete in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Championship of America, which he won in 1982.

Dever originally developed the fantasy world of Magnamund in 1975, and in 1977 he began using it as the setting for his &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaigns. Originally called &quot;Chinaraux&quot;, at first the world consisted of only the northern continent of Magnamund. The story is based around Lone Wolf, who is a young cadet in a monastic order of warriors known as the Kai Lords who defend their home of Sommerlund from the forces of evil, embodied by the Darklords of Helgedad. After a surprise invasion, all of the Kai are massacred and only Lone Wolf survives the final battle. The rest of the book series follows Lone Wolf and, later, his successor in their attempts to take revenge on the Darklords and then to thwart the plans of Dark God Naar to control their world for evil.

==Production==
===Original publication===
&quot;Lone Wolf&quot; was originally meant to be published as a role-playing game system for Games Workshop, before Dever negotiated a better deal from Beaver Books, an imprint of Hutchinson Publishing Ltd., and released it as a connected series of solo gamebooks. Dever was originally contracted by this London-based publisher Hutchinson to write four books, but he had already planned for there to be twenty in the series. The first two books in the gamebook series were published simultaneously in July 1984. They sold in excess of 100,000 copies in the first week of release. Subsequently, the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series has been published in over 30 countries, translated into 18 languages, and has sold in excess of 12 million copies to date. The series was awarded the Gamemaster International &quot;All Time Great&quot; award in 1991 and also won &quot;Game Book of the Year&quot; awards in 1985, 1986 and 1987.

With the help of Joe Dever, Paul Barnett (pen name John Grant) wrote twelve novelizations of the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; books known as the &quot;Legends of Lone Wolf&quot;, several of which were heavily edited before publication. In 2004, the Italian publisher Gruppo Armenia (Milan) reprinted all 12 novels in 5 volumes of anthology. Random House ceased publishing the novelizations when &quot;the books weren&#x27;t selling&quot;. Dever has stated that as the game books precede the novelizations chronologically, they are the &quot;authoritative&quot; versions. He also developed the character Grey Star, and a sub-series of four gamebooks were written by Ian Page using this principal character (according to a 2008 interview with Joe Dever, Grey Star was Ian Page&#x27;s player character in Dever&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign, and Dever convinced Page to write game books using this detailed character and his background).

Only the first four volumes of the &quot;Legends of Lone Wolf&quot; were made available in the United States (though &quot;Sword of the Sun&quot; was divided into two separate volumes, &quot;The Tides of Treachery&quot; and &quot;Sword of the Sun&quot;), and only the first 20 of the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; gamebook series were printed in the United States. The American editions of books 13–20 were abridged versions and are shorter than the UK editions which have colour maps. In &quot;The Magnamund Companion&quot;, all the countries of the Lone Wolf world are described in some detail, as are Lone Wolf&#x27;s main enemies - the Darklords of Helgedad - and their Giak language. There is also a &quot;Ragadorn Tavern Board Game&quot;, and a solo adventure where you play as Banedon the Magician.

The later &#x27;New Order&#x27; &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; gamebooks (no.s 21–28) were printed in the UK in smaller volumes than the earlier editions, and have subsequently become highly sought after by readers eager to complete their original &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; collections. Copies of these scarce titles regularly sell for over US$100 each on the internet auction site eBay. Publisher Red Fox ceased publishing the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series in 1998 after book 28, &quot;The Hunger of Sejanoz&quot;, citing fading interest in the interactive gaming genre, despite hundreds of requests for the reprinting of several &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; books that had gone out of print. It would be the last original Lone Wolf book for the next 18 years.

Between 1990 and 2011, four scripts were developed of &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; for a potential film release, but did not proceed beyond the pre-production phase.

===Republication===
In 1999, Dever gave his permission for the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; books, numbers one through twenty, to be published for free on the internet by the non-profit organization Project Aon. Joe Dever later gave his permission to publish the New Order series and &quot;The Magnamund Companion&quot;. In July 2014, on the 30th anniversary of the first publication of &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot;, the 28th book in his &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; series was released online by Project Aon. The &quot;World of Lone Wolf&quot; series, &quot;The Magnamund Companion&quot; and several other &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; related written works are also available for free download from this site.

Mongoose Publishing reprinted the original &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; gamebooks in collector hardcover volumes beginning in 2007. The first of the new Lone Wolf Collector&#x27;s Editions, &quot;Flight from the Dark&quot;, was thoroughly revised and expanded by Dever with the addition of two hundred new sections. It was shortlisted for the 2008 Origins Fiction Award (Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design). In April 2010, the German language translation (Einsamer Wolf: Flucht aus dem Dunkel) won the Best Fantasy Gamebook Award at the RPC Event in Cologne, Germany.

Mongoose also arranged to publish &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; through its originally intended full 32-book arc as Dever wanted, as the original series had only gone through 28 books. The first seventeen books in this series were published by Mongoose Publishing before it was announced that the company had lost the license to publish the Lone Wolf line on 27 February 2013. Shortly after this, it was announced that German publisher, Mantikore-Verlag, had acquired the rights to continue publishing the Collector series hardcovers in English from book 18 to 28. On 1 April 2015, it was announced that book 29, &quot;The Storms of Chai&quot;, would be published for the first time in the fall of 2015 in both Italian and English. However, after the 22nd book in the series, &quot;The Buccaneers of Shadaki&quot;, was published in September 2015, Mantikore-Verlag lost the publishing rights of the series. Without a publisher, the English version of &quot;The Storms of Chai&quot; would have to wait while its Italian version was published on 29 October 2015.

On 1 December 2015, Cubicle 7 Entertainment Ltd acquired the license to publish the Lone Wolf Gamebooks from Mantikore-Verlag, pushing the publication of book 29 in English to spring 2016. However, on 29 January 2016 Cubicle 7 announced that they had come back on their decision and that they would not publish the Lone Wolf series of gamebooks. On 1 April 2016, Joe Dever announced that he would publish the remaining Lone Wolf&#x27;s books himself with his own imprint, Holmgard Press, starting with the publication of book 29 later the same month, which was finally released on 12 May 2016.

On 4 March 2016, at the Mantova Comics &amp; Games Show (Mantova, Italy), Dever announced that the Italian edition of Lone Wolf 30, &quot;Dead in the Deep&quot; was scheduled for publication at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games Show 2016, but his ill health and untimely death prevented this. Following his death, his son Ben announced that his family would work to publish the remaining three books of the saga. The first two books, &quot;Dead in the Deep&quot; and &quot;The Dusk of Eternal Night&quot;, were published in 2019 and 2020 respectively and were written by Ben Devere and Vincent Lazzari, based on Joe Dever&#x27;s notes. The last story of the series, &quot;Light of the Kai&quot;, will be divided into two volumes that are planned to be released in October 2024 and October 2025 respectively.

Since 2022, Holmgard Press has started republishing the whole series as a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; which aims the mass market, with newly revised version of the books. As of November 2022, the first five books have been republished.

On 1 November 2015, Dever was awarded a plaque on the Lucca &#x27;Walk of Fame&#x27; (Lucca - Tuscany, Italy) for his writing and games design. He also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the organisers of the Lucca Comics &amp; Games Show.

On 14 January 2016, French Publisher Gallimard Jeunesse announced that their Loup Solitaire editions have sold in excess of 2.8 million copies since first publication in 1986. They have remained constantly in print in France for the past 30 years. The French edition of Loup Solitaire 29 was published in 2017.

==Other creations==
In addition to &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;, Dever has also created two other role-playing gamebook series (&quot;Freeway Warrior&quot; and &quot;Combat Heroes&quot;) and designed several best-selling computer and video games for PCs and consoles. The &quot;Freeway Warrior&quot; series of gamebooks are set in a post-apocalyptic, &quot;Mad Max&quot;-like world. The series was revived in Italy in October 2015 and the first book was published on 29 October and the second book was published on 3 March 2016. The &quot;Combat Heroes&quot; gamebooks are illustrated adventures where each paragraph is a full-page picture representing what the player sees, with two modes. Alone, the aim is to escape from a maze. In one-on-one play, two players are dueling in a maze. Each player has a different book; at a given page, the illustration shows an empty corridor; when the other character is in sight (i.e. the players read given page numbers), the player has to turn to another page showing the other opponent&#x27;s position in the corridor. Combat is then resolved before the game continues.

Among Dever&#x27;s many video game contributions is the best-selling &quot;Killzone&quot; game for which he wrote the backstory and created the principal characters.

<text>Patricia Field (born February 12, 1942) is an American costume designer, stylist, and fashion designer working in New York City.

==Early life==
Field was born in New York City to an Armenian father and a Greek mother, who emigrated from Plomari, Lesbos. She was raised in Queens, where her family owned a drycleaning store; her father died when she was 8 years old. She studied government and philosophy at New York University.

==Fashion career==
With her then-partner Jo-Ann Salvucci, Field opened her first boutique, Pants Pub, in 1966 on Washington Place in Greenwich Village. The shop, later renamed to the eponymous Patricia Field, moved in 1971 to 8th Street, then to West Broadway, and finally to 306 Bowery in NoHo, where Field owned the property. She sold it in 2016 to concentrate on costume designing for television and film. In 2018 she opened the ARTFashion Gallery on the Lower East Side, which sells art and hand-painted original clothing and accessories by a selected group of artists.

Field is credited with originating the fashion for leggings in the 1970s. Her stores were popular with the transgender and underground communities; she became known for what she calls &quot;freaky fashion&quot;.

Her design influences include John Galliano, Diane von Furstenberg, and Thierry Mugler. She was a mentor for fashion designer Hushidar Mortezaie.

==Costuming==
Field was the costume designer for the 1987 film &quot;Lady Beware&quot; and the TV series &quot;Crime Story&quot;. After she met Sarah Jessica Parker during the filming of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot;, they became friends and Field was engaged to design the costumes for the TV series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The show became well known for its fashions, particularly for their individuality and unexpectedness. For her work on &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, Field was nominated for five Emmy Awards, with one win, and nominated for six Costume Designers Guild awards, with four wins. She is one out of six honorees of the 2008 Real Time Film Festival. She returned as costume designer for the 2008 movie &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and its 2010 sequel &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;, but did not work on the 2021–2022 series reboot, &quot;And Just Like That…&quot;.

After the successes of the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; costumes, Field was in high demand for new projects in television and film. Her other television credits include &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;, &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;Younger&quot; on TV Land, season 11 of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and &quot;Emily in Paris&quot;. In 2011, she designed most of the outfits for the characters in a Taiwan television drama called &quot;Material Queen&quot;.

In film, her credits include &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, and &quot;Second Act&quot; (2018). In the Asian market, she created the fashion behind the 2010 Chinese feature film &quot;Go Lala Go!&quot; ().

She designed the outfits in Namie Amuro&#x27;s music videos for her three songs &quot;New Look&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, and &quot;What A Feeling&quot; from her single 60s 70s 80s; as well as Anna Vissi&#x27;s music videos for &quot;Stin Pyra&quot; and &quot;Alitissa Psihi&quot; from her album &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot;.

A documentary film on her career called &quot;Happy Clothes: A Film About Patricia Field&quot;, directed by Michael Selditch, had its world premiere at the Tribeca Festival in 2023.

==Television appearances==

Field appeared as the first guest judge during the first season of the Bravo reality television series &quot;Project Runway&quot;. Her boutique was featured in a 2007 episode of Kathy Griffin&#x27;s reality show &quot;My Life on the D-List&quot; and in a 2008 episode of &quot;Paris Hilton&#x27;s My New BFF&quot;. She also appeared as a guest judge during the third episode of the cycle 15 of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. 

==Publications==
In February 2023, she published a memoir, &quot;Pat in the City: My Life of Fashion, Style, and Breaking All the Rules&quot;.

==Personal life==
Field is a lesbian, and was in a long-term relationship with costume designer Rebecca Weinberg (Field), with whom she partnered on &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

Field defended Dior head designer John Galliano after he was arrested in February 2011 over alleged anti-semitic comments in a Paris bar, describing Galliano&#x27;s videotaped behavior in a phone interview with &quot;WWD&quot; as &quot;farce&quot; and &quot;theater&quot;.

<doc id="473266" wikidata="Q7041550" url="?curid=473266" title="Nittany Lion">
<text>The Nittany Lion is the eastern mountain lion mascot of the athletic teams of the Pennsylvania State University, known as the Penn State Nittany Lions. Created in 1907, the &quot;Nittany&quot; forename refers to the local Mount Nittany, which overlooks the university.

== History ==

The mascot was the creation of Penn State senior H. D. &quot;Joe&quot; Mason in 1904. While on a trip to Princeton University, Mason had been embarrassed that Penn State did not have a mascot. Mason did not let that deter him: he fabricated the Nittany Lion on the spot and proclaimed that it would easily defeat the Princeton Bengal tiger.

The Lion&#x27;s primary means of attack against the Tiger would be its strong right arm, capable of slaying any foes, which is now traditionally exemplified through cumulative one-armed push-ups after the team scores a touchdown. Upon returning to campus, he set about making his invention a reality. In 1907, he wrote in the student publication &quot;The Lemon&quot;: 

=== History===

Eastern mountain lions had roamed on nearby Mount Nittany until the 1880s. The name &quot;Mount Nittany&quot; derives from the Algonquian word meaning &quot;single mountain.&quot; The &quot;original&quot; Nittany Lion can be seen in the Penn State All-Sports Museum. It was killed in Susquehanna County by Samuel Brush in 1856. According to a July 1992 article in &quot;National Geographic&quot; by Maurice Hornocker titled &quot;Learning to Live with Mountain Lions&quot;, &quot;Courthouse records from Centre County, Pennsylvania, show that one local hunter killed 64 lions between 1820 and 1845. During those 25 years an estimated 600 cats were killed in that county alone.&quot;

== Theme song ==

In the early 1920s, a song was created to honor the mascot. Entitled &quot;The Nittany Lion&quot;, it is played during sporting events on campus.

<doc id="473268" wikidata="Q582021" url="?curid=473268" title="Hollywood Ending">
<text>Hollywood Ending is a 2002 American comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen, who also plays the principal character. It tells the story of a once-famous film director who suffers hysterical blindness due to the intense pressure of directing.

==Plot==
Val Waxman is a once-prestigious film director who now directs television commercials. When he is thrown off his latest effort (a deodorant commercial filmed in the frozen north of Canada), he desperately seeks a real movie project.

Out of the blue, Val receives an offer to direct a big-budget blockbuster to be set in New York City. However, the offer comes from his former wife, Ellie, and her boyfriend, Hal, the studio head who stole her from Val years ago.

Pushed by his agent Al Hack, Val reluctantly agrees to the project, but a psychosomatic ailment strikes him blind just before production is to begin. With Al&#x27;s encouragement and aid, Val keeps his blindness a secret from the cast and crew (and Hal). During filming, Val rekindles his relationship with Ellie and reconnects with his estranged son, Tony, while his much younger girlfriend, Lori, leaves him. When Val regains what had been missing his life, he regains his sight as well, and realizes that the movie he directed while blind is a disaster.

Sure enough, the movie flops - but is a hit in France, where he is invited to direct a film. After winning Ellie back, he happily proclaims, &quot;Thank God the French exist.&quot;

==Cast ==
==Production notes==

Haskell Wexler was the original cinematographer, but was fired by Woody Allen after a week of filming as they could not agree on how to film certain shots. Wedigo von Schultzendorff replaced Wexler.

==Box office==
Ticket sales in the United States reach just under $5 million and a worldwide gross of $14.8 million.

It was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. In the United Kingdom, it was the first of Allen&#x27;s films not to receive a theatrical release.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 47% rating based on reviews from 133 critics, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Although &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; contains some zany one-liners, its promising premise is far from developed.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 37 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Bryant Frazer thought that it suffered from poor editing. He wrote, &quot;What&#x27;s most frustrating is the sense that &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; could have been quite a bit better than it actually is. At 114 minutes, it&#x27;s decisively lacking in the brevity that used to characterize Allen&#x27;s pictures—even the super-serious, Bergman-inspired stuff. Worse, his timing seems to be off—the filmmaker who was once notorious for cutting his films to the absolute bone now gives us rambling, overlong shots featuring performers who almost seem to be ad libbing their dialogue. I ran to the Internet Movie Database to investigate, and discovered what may be the problem—Susan Morse is gone. Morse, the editor who had worked with Allen since &quot;Manhattan&quot; in 1979 and who turned into a real soldier by the time of the jazzy montage that characterized &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot;, was reportedly a victim of budget-cutting within the ranks.&quot;

In 2016, film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; as the worst movie by Woody Allen.

<text>Prozzäk (also known as Simon and Milo) are a Canadian virtual pop music duo formed by Jay Levine and James Bryan McCollum in 1998. Their recordings and animated music videos tell the comedic tale of their frontmen, Simon (Levine) and Milo (McCollum), who are best friends on a search to find true love.

Since their formation, the duo have released four studio albums and received four Juno Award nominations. Prozzäk was also among the top 80 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada from their beginning to 2016.

==History==
In the 1990s, Levine and McCollum were members of The Philosopher Kings, a Canadian R&amp;B band. After a physical altercation between them, they attempted to smooth things over by writing music together. While on a European tour with the Kings, the two created a comedic song titled &quot;Europa&quot; in which they sang in British accents. The song did not fit in with the music produced by the Philosopher Kings, but the band&#x27;s record company, Sony Canada, approved of it, so the two set aside their differences and created Prozzäk in 1998. The band name was inspired by the drug Prozac.

The decision to portray the band through animation came as a result of Levine feeling uncomfortable performing with an accent. The duo developed the look of Simon and Milo with illustrator Scott Harder. The band scripted and storyboarded the initial music videos with Sony&#x27;s Marc Lostracco. They were animated by Evening Sky/Animation House.

Their first album, &quot;Hot Show&quot;, was released in late 1998. The album featured the hit singles &quot;Sucks to Be You&quot; and &quot;Strange Disease&quot; and was certified triple platinum in Canada. Prozzäk was nominated for Best New Group at the 2000 Juno Awards, as well as being nominated for Best Album (&quot;Hot Show&quot;), Best Single (&quot;Sucks to Be You&quot;), and Best Video (&quot;Strange Disease&quot;). In 2000, Levine and McCollum wrote and produced several songs for Canadian pop group B4-4, including their hit song &quot;Get Down&quot;. In late 2000, Prozzäk released their second album, &quot;Saturday People&quot;, on Epic Records. The album included the singles &quot;www.nevergetoveryou&quot; and &quot;Be As&quot;. The album was certified gold in Canada and nominated for Best Pop Album at the 2002 Juno Awards.

Prozzäk joined with Disney to increase promotion and released the album &quot;Ready Ready Set Go&quot;, also named &quot;Simon and Milo&quot;. It is a compilation of songs from their first two albums along with a new single, &quot;Get a Clue&quot; which was written for the TV movie &quot;Get a Clue&quot; starring Lindsay Lohan. The duo were also developing an animated series with Disney, but it would ultimately go unproduced.

Prozzäk&#x27;s next album, &quot;Cruel Cruel World&quot; was released by MapleMusic in 2005. &quot;Cruel Cruel World&quot; was released on an independent label and did not receive as much promotion as their first two albums, nor did it achieve the same success. The album overhauled Simon and Milo&#x27;s appearance, with &quot;When I Think of You&quot; receiving an animated music video directed by Frederick Marcello Wilmot at Horus Productions. Two songs were released online in 2006, &quot;DJ-J-Vox&quot; and &quot;DJ (Calibe Remix)&quot;.

In 2008, the band released a song titled &quot;Chloe the Chicken&quot; on a kids&#x27; album titled &quot;Roll Play&quot;.

===Reunions===
After being inactive for several years, Prozzäk performed a reunion concert at the Atomic Lollipop Festival in Toronto on July 18, 2015, where they debuted a new song. Entitled &quot;Baby I Need Your Love (Pussy Cat Pussy Cat)&quot;, its September 18, 2015 release became their first single in a decade. This was followed by &quot;Love Fools Anonymous&quot; on June 15, 2016; in November of that year they released &quot;My Little Snowflake&quot;.

On February 3, 2017, Prozzäk released the single &quot;Love Me Tinder&quot; from an album in progress. An animated music video by Kevin Muhlbach for the single debuted on March 17. Titled &quot;Forever 1999&quot;, the album was released on March 31, 2017. It was supported by a tour across Canada that spring. In March 2018, the band attempted to launch &quot;Prozzak: Love Addicts&quot;, an animated series produced by Portfolio Entertainment and Duopoly. The project didn&#x27;t receive financing and went unproduced.

In September 2018, Prozzäk toured across Canada with Aqua and Whigfield as part of the &quot;Rewind Tour&quot;.

On September 9, 2019, Prozzäk announced that they would embark on their final tour, titled the &quot;Never Get Over You Farewell Tour&quot;. On May 22, 2022, Prozzäk reunited to perform at &quot;Fizzfest&quot; in Toronto, opening for Bran Van 3000. On August 25, 2023, Prozzäk performed as part of &quot;Y2K @ Churchill Square&quot; for Edmonton&#x27;s Pride Festival.

==Simon and Milo==
Prozzäk are two animated characters named Simon and Milo. The creation of Simon and Milo initially began with accents suggested by the other members of The Philosopher Kings during their road trips. The cartoon characters designed by artist Scott Harder became a part of Prozzäk.

In &quot;The Prozzäk Story&quot; video, Simon and Milo are over 200 years old and were enemies in a previous life. Simon and Milo fought each other in a 20-year-old war called &quot;Ochiyaki&quot;. During their battle with each other, a Great Unseen Voice projected down from the sky and told them they were to be best friends, sent through time to the 21st century, where they were given a mission. That mission was for the two to find true love through their music. The story is based on the formation of the duo.

In their music videos, Simon, a short and skinny man with jet-black hair and no neck, is in constant search of his true love, believing that the perfect woman is out there. As a result, Simon ends up feeling depressed. Milo is a tall and muscular man with blond hair who accompanies Simon on his quest. Their introduction in the album &quot;Saturday People&quot; tells of their many visits to nightclubs and bars in hopes of finding true love, after which Simon gives up, and lies &quot;face down in his own banana milkshake&quot;. Just then, the Great Unseen Voice from the heavens calls out, telling them that they have lost their way, and reminds them that only True Love holds the key to their destiny. Their music thus represents their social journey to find their true love.

==Band members==
Levine is the lead singer of Prozzäk and the voice behind Simon. Through the music, Simon tells stories that represent Levine&#x27;s actual life; for example, the song &quot;Anna-Lisa&quot; makes reference to his parents&#x27; divorce. Levine has founded a company, Lefthook Entertainment, that helps artists market their music. He is also currently an artist under the name Today Kid.

McCollum is a guitarist who portrays Milo. He is the founder of UMI Entertainment based in Toronto. He also plays guitar for fellow Canadian recording artist Nelly Furtado.

<doc id="473273" wikidata="Q1102220" url="?curid=473273" title="Jurassic Park III">
<text>Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science fiction action film directed by Joe Johnston and written by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor. It is the third installment in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise and the final film in the original &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; trilogy, following &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997). It is also the first film in the franchise not to be directed by Steven Spielberg, as well as the first not to be based on a novel by Michael Crichton; however, the film features characters and ideas by Crichton. It stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan and Michael Jeter, with brief appearances by Laura Dern. Neill and Dern reprise their roles from the first film as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. The plot involves a divorced couple who, via subterfuge, enlist the help of paleontologist Dr. Grant to find their son, who has gone missing on Isla Sorna.

After the release of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Universal Pictures announced the third film in June 1998, and Johnston was announced as director the following year. A draft written by Buchman was rejected five weeks ahead of filming in favor of a simpler story idea suggested by David Koepp, the writer of the previous two films. Payne and Taylor were hired to rewrite the earlier script by Buchman, who made further revisions to their draft. Filming lasted five months, beginning in Hawaii in August 2000, before moving to California. A final draft of the script was never completed during production, a circumstance Johnston considered quitting over. &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; features a combination of computer-generated and animatronic dinosaurs. A &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; replaces the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; from the previous two films as the main antagonist.

&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; premiered on July 16, 2001, and was theatrically released on July 18. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box-office success, grossing $368.8 million worldwide against a $93 million budget, becoming the eighth highest-grossing film of 2001; however, it is the lowest-grossing installment in the franchise. In 2015, it was followed by &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, which would start the sequel trilogy of the same name. Neill and Dern would reprise their roles in &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot; (2022).

==Plot==

Paleontologist Alan Grant struggles to secure funding for his &quot;Velociraptor&quot; research, where he attempts to prove his hypothesis they were intellectually and socially advanced. Instead, he finds himself rebuffing the public&#x27;s obsession with the events on Isla Nublar and the InGen incident in San Diego. He receives encouragement to continue from his now-married ex-girlfriend Ellie Sattler and his assistant Billy Brennan, who uses 3D printing to replicate a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; larynx. Wealthy couple Paul and Amanda Kirby offer to fund his research in return for a guided aerial tour of Isla Sorna, claiming they have permission to fly there.

Alan reluctantly agrees, flying there with Billy, two of the Kirbys&#x27; mercenary associates, Udesky and Cooper, and their pilot, Nash. When the Kirbys try to have Nash land the plane, Alan protests and is knocked unconscious by Cooper. He awakens to find they have landed, and the Kirbys refuse to leave, until a &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; approaches them. They attempt to escape but the dinosaur attacks their plane during take-off and kills Cooper. The plane crashes in the forest, and the Spinosaurus kills Nash and swallows Paul&#x27;s satellite phone. The survivors flee, encountering a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which is promptly defeated by the Spinosaurus as the humans escape.

The Kirbys reveal they are a divorced, middle-class couple searching for their son Eric and Amanda&#x27;s boyfriend Ben Hildebrand, who have been missing for eight weeks and were last seen illegally parasailing by the island. Government agencies declined to help so they deceived Alan to secure his assistance, mistakenly believing he had experience on Isla Sorna. The group searches for Eric and Ben, finding the latter&#x27;s corpse attached to the parasail near a velociraptor nest. They discover the InGen compound, where they are attacked by a pack of Velociraptors, who kill Udesky. Alan is separated from the rest of the group but is saved from the raptors by Eric, who has been sheltering in a supply truck.

The following morning, Alan and Eric reunite with Billy and Eric&#x27;s parents and narrowly escape the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; again. Alan finds Billy stole Velociraptor eggs, which resulted in the earlier attacks. Billy hoped to sell the eggs to fund their dig site, which Alan disapproves of, but keeps the eggs regardless, hoping the Velociraptors may spare the group if they are returned. The group enters an aviary and is attacked by a flock of &quot;Pteranodons&quot;, one of which takes Eric to its nest to feed him to its young; Billy rescues Eric using the parasail but is seemingly killed while the rest escape by boat along an adjacent river. They retrieve the satellite phone and Grant contacts Ellie for help while they are attacked once again by the Spinosaurus.

The following day, the group hears a helicopter overhead and arrives at the coast, but are ambushed by the &quot;Velociraptors&quot;, who have come for the eggs. Alan, finding the replicated larynx in Billy&#x27;s bag, uses it to confuse the pack. Upon hearing distant helicopters, the raptors reclaim their eggs and retreat. The U.S. Marines and Navy, summoned by Ellie, land on the beach and rescue the survivors. On a helicopter, they discover that an injured Billy has also been rescued. They watch the now-freed &quot;Pteranodons&quot; fly alongside them as they leave the island.

==Production==

When Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was released in 1993, his friend Joe Johnston became interested in directing a potential sequel. While Spielberg expected to direct the sequel, he agreed Johnston could direct a possible third film. The second film, entitled &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, includes a scene showing a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; rampaging through San Diego; Spielberg had intended to use this scene for a third film but later decided to add it into the second installment, after realizing he probably would not direct another film in the series.

After the release of the second film in May 1997, Spielberg was busy with other projects; when asked about the possibility of a third &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film, he responded that it would give him a tremendous headache &quot;just to think about it&quot;. Spielberg had no intention of returning to the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series as a director, stating that the films were difficult to make. He had been satisfied with directing the previous films, and felt that the third film needed someone new to take over. After the release of the second film, Johnston again asked Spielberg about directing a &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; sequel.

===Pre-production===
Universal Pictures announced the film in June 1998, with Spielberg as a producer. Michael Crichton, who wrote the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; novels, was to collaborate with Spielberg to create a storyline and write a script, although Johnston later said that Crichton had no involvement with the project. The film was originally set for release in mid-2000. Spielberg initially devised a story involving Dr. Alan Grant, who was discovered to have been living on one of InGen&#x27;s islands. According to Johnston: &quot;He&#x27;d snuck in, after not being allowed in to research the dinosaurs, and was living in a tree like Robinson Crusoe. But I couldn&#x27;t imagine this guy wanting to get back on any island that had dinosaurs in it after the first movie&quot;.

Craig Rosenberg, who previously wrote and directed &quot;Hotel de Love&quot;, began writing the first draft of &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; in June 1999. Spielberg and Johnston were impressed by Rosenberg&#x27;s prior work, which included thriller screenplays for Spielberg&#x27;s company DreamWorks. Rosenberg&#x27;s draft involved teenagers becoming marooned on Isla Sorna, and it included a sequence involving the aquatic reptile &quot;Kronosaurus&quot;, which was not featured in the final film. Another scrapped scene would involve characters on motorcycles trying to evade raptors.

Johnston was announced as the film&#x27;s director in August 1999, with Rosenberg still attached. Spielberg gave complete creative freedom to Johnston, who said that Spielberg &quot;has strongly pointed out that I shouldn&#x27;t try to copy him&quot;. Production was expected to begin in early 2000. The previous films were shot in Hawaii, and the island of Kauai was the preferred filming location for the third film, although no decisions would be made until the finalization of the script. Rosenberg&#x27;s draft about teenagers on Isla Sorna was rejected in September 1999. Johnston said it was &quot;not a badly written script&quot;, but he felt that viewers would not want to see such a story, also saying that it read like a bad episode of &quot;Friends&quot;.

====Buchman draft====
Peter Buchman was hired to rewrite Rosenberg&#x27;s draft, and did so going into early 2000. Buchman&#x27;s draft involves dinosaurs causing a series of mysterious killings on the mainland, followed by an investigation. The script also has a parallel story that involves Alan Grant, Billy, and a family crash-landing on Isla Sorna.

The draft begins with a vacationing couple who go parasailing over Isla Sorna, becoming the latest tourists to go missing there. A representative for the U.S. State Department, Harlan Finch, goes to Costa Rica and meets environmentalist Simone Garcia, who informs him of a recent dinosaur attack. Meanwhile, Grant is seeking financial donors for a raptor research station that he wants to build on Isla Sorna. Finch offers Grant exclusive research rights to the island if he will help the U.S. government acquire jurisdiction over it. Grant agrees and is scheduled to testify along with Simone at a hearing, to be held the next day in San José, Costa Rica.

Grant also meets Paul Roby, a wealthy businessman who offers him a donation if he will host an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant agrees, and they fly over the island prior to the hearing, along with Grant&#x27;s graduate student Billy Hume and Paul&#x27;s 12-year-old son Miles, a dinosaur enthusiast. Also on the tour is Paul&#x27;s bodyguard Cooper, and Susan Brentworth, Paul&#x27;s business associate and girlfriend. The plane is forced to land on the island after hitting an unidentified object. As it takes off again, it hits a &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and crashes. The story would then alternate between the island and San José. The hearing would reveal that dinosaur attacks have taken place in various mainland locations, ranging from the Baja California Peninsula to Panama. Finch becomes concerned that the dinosaurs are breeding, thus posing a worldwide problem.

The island scenes would largely play out the same as the final film, although the aviary and InGen laboratory sequences were much longer and more complex in this draft. Part of the script would involve the humans spending the night in the laboratory and making it their base of operations, although velociraptors would eventually sneak into the lab, after Billy stole their eggs. The humans would escape on dirt bikes and later take refuge in treetops. Cooper would die to velociraptors while protecting Miles, and Billy would die to a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; during the aviary sequence. Near the end of the draft, the U.S. government sends in fighter jets to bomb the island and destroy its dinosaur population. In the process, Roby is spotted by a pilot and he and his family are rescued from the island. However, Grant refuses to leave and, in his final scene, retreats into the jungle, incorporating Spielberg&#x27;s initial idea.

These final scenes inspired the title &quot;Jurassic Park: Extinction&quot;, although the filmmakers decided against this name as it seemed to suggest a definitive end to the franchise. Johnston also considered it a vague title, with &quot;Extinction&quot; potentially referring to the dinosaurs, the human population, or Grant. The name was eventually simplified as &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Johnston said that no one was &quot;particularly fond&quot; of the title &quot;but you certainly knew what it meant&quot;. Other potential titles included &quot;Jurassic Park: Breakout&quot; and &quot;The Extinction: Jurassic Park 3&quot;.

Filming locations were scouted for this draft, including Fiordland, New Zealand, which was once considered as a location for the previous film. In March 2000, Maui, Hawaii, reportedly had been chosen instead of New Zealand.

====Casting and further rewrites====
Sam Neill signed to the project in June 2000, reprising his role from the first film as Alan Grant. Johnston later described Grant in the third film as being more cynical and sarcastic following the character&#x27;s experience in the first film. Neill turned down a role in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001) to reprise his role in the film. Neill was happy to return, as he felt his performance in the first film could have been better. Hawaii was confirmed as a filming location for a three-week shoot, and filming overall was expected to take 18 weeks. Filming was scheduled to begin by August 2000, with a projected release in July 2001. William H. Macy originally turned down his role due to scheduling conflicts, so filming was delayed by a month. Macy had been working with Laura Dern on the 2001 film &quot;Focus&quot;, and she urged him to accept the role in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Trevor Morgan and Téa Leoni were subsequently announced as cast members.

Johnston felt that Buchman&#x27;s draft was too complicated, particularly in getting Grant back to an island of dinosaurs. When screenwriter David Koepp held discussions with Johnston, Koepp suggested the simpler &quot;rescue mission&quot; plot. Koepp had written the previous two films, but had no involvement in writing the script for &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. In July 2000, about five weeks before filming began, Johnston and Spielberg rejected the entire second script because they were dissatisfied with it; $18 million had already been spent on the film, which had been storyboarded and budgeted. Some set-building had already begun, as well. The rejection came after Johnston and Spielberg approved Koepp&#x27;s story idea, believing it to be superior to the earlier story. Many sequences from the second rejected draft, and some from the original draft, were incorporated into the final film as a way of salvaging the work that had been put into the project up to that point. At the time, Utah&#x27;s Dinosaur National Monument and a military base at Oahu were being considered as filming locations.

Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor began rewriting Buchman&#x27;s script in July 2000, while Spielberg signed a deal with Universal to receive 20% of the film&#x27;s profits. Payne and Taylor were hired to improve the film&#x27;s characters and story, as the script primarily consisted of action. They were surprised to receive the writing offer, as the project differed from past films on which they had worked, but Universal had been impressed with their rewrite on the studio&#x27;s film &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. Payne and Taylor were not hardcore fans of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise, although Taylor enjoyed its premise. The two writers watched the previous &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films and spent the next four weeks writing their draft of the script.

Payne and Taylor had previously written &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; (1996), which starred Dern. She had also portrayed Ellie in the first &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film. The character was absent from the previous &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; script, so Payne and Taylor decided to write in a small part for Dern to reprise the role. She was initially hesitant to reappear only for a cameo, so Spielberg suggested that Ellie have an important role in saving the characters on the island. Dern was convinced after learning that Payne and Taylor were working on the script. In one draft, Neill and Dern&#x27;s characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to see them as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don&#x27;t think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;s aged for the past 15 years!&quot;

Buchman made subsequent revisions to the script, and John August did uncredited work on it, as well. Much of the humor added by Payne and Taylor was not used in the final film. According to Payne: &quot;We gave them a new script, and then we saw the movie, and it&#x27;s all action. They took the rest out!&quot; Writing credit ultimately went to Buchman, Payne, and Taylor. Johnston described the final film as simpler, faster-moving, and more intense than the earlier films.

===Filming===
A final draft of the script was never completed during production. While the first act was mostly in place, the middle portion of the script was not as complete, and the ending had yet to be written. Principal photography began on August 30, 2000, and it lasted five months. Filming the script was a lengthy process because of technical preparations before scenes. Macy criticized the project during filming. Commenting on the slow pace of filming, he said &quot;we would do a quarter-page, [or] some days, an eighth of a page. And that would be a full 12-hour day&quot;. Johnston said that filming ultimately went over schedule by a few days, primarily because of weather and unexpected technical issues, although he was satisfied with how the schedule eventually turned out considering these issues.

Macy also noted that executive producer Spielberg was not seen on set, despite a chair bearing his name that was always present, with Macy saying, &quot;You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a threat or a promise!&quot; Spielberg was busy creating the 2001 film &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;. While Macy was impressed with the &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; footage, he criticized the project for starting without a finished script: &quot;The script has been evolving and being rewritten as we go, and what you want to say is, &#x27;Who launched a $100 million ship without a rudder, and who&#x27;s getting fired for this?&#x27; But that&#x27;s the way it goes. That&#x27;s the way they make these movies... big deal. I think someone should be shot, but I&#x27;m not in charge&quot;. Johnston said the actors went through an uncomfortable production shoot and that Macy may have simply made the critical comments on a bad day of filming. As the film approached its release, Macy said: &quot;It was about the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever done in this business&quot;.

Johnston thought about quitting the project on a few occasions because of uncertainty about how the film would turn out, considering that it did not have a finished script. He said that making the film was &quot;a living hell on a daily basis&quot;, and that shooting without a finished script was &quot;nerve-wracking, but it was also a way of freeing up the whole creative process. We could literally decide on the day how we wanted a scene to progress. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the way to make movies, but it gives you more freedom&quot;. Johnston said the actors were &quot;very flexible&quot; and that they dealt with the lack of a finished script &quot;the best they could&quot;.

Actor Alessandro Nivola criticized the film after its release, saying in a 2002 interview: &quot;It was like the only part I&#x27;ve ever done that just had nothing for me to latch on to, character-wise. [...] It was kind of maddening&quot;. The actors were frequently bruised during filming. Leoni said &quot;more of my makeup was to cover the real bruises than to create fake ones&quot;. Michael Lantieri, who worked on the previous films, returned as the special effects consultant. Lantieri said that &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; was the most physically demanding film of the series: &quot;We had a cast that was willing to get real bruises and bumps, be around real heat, and actually go underwater&quot;.

====Locations====
Filming began at Dillingham Airfield in Mokulēia, Hawaii, and continued on Oahu during early September 2000. Filming in Oahu included Heeia Kea Ranch. Aerial footage of Molokai&#x27;s North Shore cliffs was then filmed over a two-day period, followed by a week of filming in Kauai, where locations included Hanalei Valley and rain forests in the Manoa Valley. Filming in Hawaii concluded in mid-September 2000, after scenes were shot at the South Fork of Kauai&#x27;s Wailua River. By that time, John August had been hired to do the uncredited script revisions, which were followed by additional work from Buchman. Macy also wrote a scene.

After the Hawaii shoot, production moved to California. A dinosaur lecture given by the character of Grant was filmed at Occidental College in Los Angeles on October 10, 2000. Scenes were filmed at Center Bay Studios in Los Angeles at the end of the month. Other filming locations in California included a rock quarry in Irwindale, while the interior of the InGen compound was filmed in a warehouse located east of downtown Los Angeles. Another scene was filmed at El Mirage Lake, where Udesky and the mercenaries prepare for their visit to Isla Sorna. Dern&#x27;s small role as Ellie was filmed in a day. Scenes set at Ellie&#x27;s house were filmed in South Pasadena, California.

Filming moved to Universal Studios&#x27; backlot in Los Angeles for 96 days. Production designer Ed Verreaux and greensman Danny Ondrejko created a jungle rain forest at Universal&#x27;s Stage 12. Ondrejko and his 14-member team took two months to create the jungle set, and Lantieri&#x27;s team created mist and fog through the use of pipes. Johnston was impressed with the set and had difficulty distinguishing it from the jungles in Hawaii.

The most challenging scene for Lantieri was the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; attack on the plane, which was filmed on a soundstage. Lantieri&#x27;s team built four plane props for the scene, which begins with the crashed plane in a tree, above ground. The plane soon falls to the ground and is rolled around by the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. For the early portion of the sequence, Lantieri created a pneumatic gimbal disguised as a tree, with the plane placed on top. The gimbal had 100 horsepower and was powered by hydraulics and hoses, allowing the plane to be shaken and tilted. The plane also had a breakaway cockpit area for a shot in which the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; tears the front end off.

A later portion of the attack scene required close collaboration with Winston&#x27;s team, which created a full-scale &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; leg prop, controlled by puppeteers. The leg, suspended in the air by two poles, was slammed down into one of the plane fuselage props for a series of shots. Another prop plane was rigged with a hydraulic machine, which crushed the fuselage from the inside, giving the impression that it was being crushed by the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. With another prop plane, the actors were filmed inside the fuselage as it is rolled around. The actors agreed to do their own stunts for the scene, which Macy compared to being inside a clothes dryer. Stunt people were only used for one shot during this scene.

The film is the first in the series not to be based on a novel, although it includes characters and ideas from Crichton, who wrote the novels that inspired the previous two films. For &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, Crichton received a &quot;based on characters created by&quot; credit. Scenes involving a pterosaur aviary and a &quot;T. rex&quot;″s attempted attack on a river raft were featured in the first novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1990). Although these scenes were absent from the novel&#x27;s film adaptation, they were added into &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. The film&#x27;s &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; attack on the boat is a modified version of the scene from the novel.

At Falls Lake, located on the Universal lot, Verreaux and his team built a giant rock wall as part of a set that would depict InGen&#x27;s &quot;Pteranodon&quot; aviary. Three months were spent laying foam blocks that were molded by hand to form jagged rock. A team subsequently built a 10-story, three-sided scaffold covered with netting to simulate the aviary. The aviary scene was filmed in early December 2000. The set was then redecorated for the nighttime sequence in which the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; attacks the boat. The scene involved rain and fire, and took nine nights of filming. Part of the scene required Macy to stand on a giant crane and distract the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. Macy fell off the crane, but had a harness. Another portion of the scene required the actors to perform under water. The scene depicting the satellite phone in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; feces was filmed using of oatmeal.
In a November 2000 draft of the script, the U.S. State Department was to send in a helicopter and Ellie to rescue the characters, with Ellie explaining that she arrived thanks to a good friend at the department. This ending was not considered exciting enough, resulting in the final ending with the Marines and Navy coming to rescue the characters, while excluding Ellie from coming to the island. In the final film, Ellie&#x27;s husband is an employee of the State Department, although his involvement in rescuing the group is not specified. The new ending was written in December, and the Pentagon lent two Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawks to the production, as well as four assault amphibious vehicles and 80 Marines. Production returned to Hawaii in January 2001 to film the ending on Kauai&#x27;s Pila&#x27;a Beach. The film&#x27;s longest rough cut without credits was around 96 minutes long. The final film, including credits, is 92 minutes, making it the shortest installment in the series.

===Creatures on screen===
As with the previous films, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) provided dinosaurs through computer-generated imagery (CGI), while Stan Winston and his team provided animatronics. The animatronics were more advanced than those used in previous films, and included the ability to blink, for an increased sense of realism. While animatronics were used for close-up shots, other scenes used sticks with pictures of dinosaur heads attached, as placeholders to which the actors could react.

Puppeteers worked together to create the &quot;T. rex&quot;, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Velociraptor&quot; movements. Multiple puppeteers were assigned to operate different parts of each animatronic dinosaur, and in some cases, hours of practice were needed for a dinosaur&#x27;s puppeteers to perform in synchrony. The animatronics were powerful and considered dangerous, as one wrong move could kill someone. One scene, depicting Udesky&#x27;s death, was filmed with Winston team member John Rosengrant wearing a partial raptor suit.

Winston&#x27;s team took roughly 13 months to design and create the various practical dinosaurs. ILM scanned dinosaur sculptures, also created by Winston&#x27;s team, to create the computer-generated versions of the animals. ILM designed some dinosaurs entirely through CGI, including &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. New dinosaurs not featured in earlier films included the &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, in addition to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Corythosaurus&quot;.

Like the previous films, paleontologist Jack Horner worked as technical advisor. Horner was brought on early in the film&#x27;s development when story ideas were being considered. After two films, the filmmakers wanted to replace the &quot;T. rex&quot; with a new dinosaur antagonist. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was originally considered, and early concept posters reflected this. Horner ultimately convinced the filmmakers to replace the &quot;T. rex&quot; with the larger &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, an animal which had a distinctive sail on its back. Johnston said that &quot;a lot of dinosaurs have a very similar silhouette to the &quot;T. rex&quot; ... and we wanted the audience to instantly recognize this as something else&quot;. Horner hypothesized that &quot;T. rex&quot; was more of a scavenger, while &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was a true predator. The roars of the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in the film were created by mixing the low guttural sounds of a lion and an alligator, a bear cub crying, and a lengthened cry of a large bird that gave the roars a raspy quality.

Winston and his sculptors created an initial &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; design, and Horner then provided his scientific opinion. Winston&#x27;s team began with a 1/16 maquette version of the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, before creating a 1/5-scale version with more detail, leading to the creation of the final, full-scale version. The process took 10 months. The &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; animatronic was built from the knees up, while full body shots of the animal were done through CGI. The animatronic measured 44 feet long, weighed 13 tons and was faster and more powerful than the 9-ton &quot;T. rex&quot;. Winston and his team had to remove a wall to get the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; out of Winston&#x27;s studio, located in Van Nuys, California. It was then transported by flatbed truck to the jungle set at Stage 12. Verreaux had to design the set to accommodate the dinosaur; a track was placed that allowed the creature to be moved backward and forward. Four Winston technicians were required to fully operate the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;.

The fight between the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;T. rex&quot; was one of the last scenes shot for the film, and the two animatronics were put to extensive use for the fight. A &quot;T. rex&quot; animatronic from the previous film was re-skinned for its appearance in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. The &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; animatronic was so powerful that it ripped the head off of the &quot;T. rex&quot; during filming. Johnston said the fight was meant as a modern homage to various earlier films that featured dinosaurs created by Ray Harryhausen. An early script featured a death sequence for the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; near the end of the film, as Grant would use the resonating chamber to call a pack of raptors which would attack and kill it.

Because of new discoveries and theories in the field of paleontology, several dinosaurs are portrayed differently in this film from in previous ones. Discoveries suggesting velociraptors were feathered prompted the addition of quill-like structures on the head and neck of the males in the film. Horner said: &quot;We&#x27;ve found evidence that velociraptors had feathers, or feather-like structures, and we&#x27;ve incorporated that into the new look of the raptor&quot;.

Spielberg insisted that Johnston include &quot;Pteranodons&quot;, which had been removed from the previous films for budget reasons, with the exception of a brief appearance in &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The &quot;Pteranodons&quot; featured in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; are a fictionalized version of the actual animal. Winston and his team created a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; model with a wingspan of 40 feet, although the creatures are predominantly featured in the film through CGI. ILM animators studied footage of bats and birds while in flight, and also closely worked with a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; expert to create the creatures&#x27; flight movements. In addition, Winston&#x27;s team designed and created five rod puppets to depict baby pteranodons in a nest, with puppeteers working underneath the nest to control them. Johnston chose the pteranodons to end the film because he wanted an ending shot of &quot;these creatures being beautiful and elegant&quot;. At one point, there were discussions about a final sequence in which the pteranodons would attack the survivors in their helicopter after departing from the island. This was scrapped for budgetary reasons.

The film contains more than 400 effects shots, about twice the number featured in the two previous films combined. Most of the shots were for the fight between the &quot;T. rex&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and for the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; aviary sequence. Less than half of the shots involved dinosaurs, as the animators also had to focus on environmental surroundings, such as jungle foliage brushed by dinosaurs. Some shots were only a few seconds long, but required months of work.

==Music==

Composer John Williams, who worked on the previous films, was busy writing the music for &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;; he recommended Don Davis to write the &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; score. Williams&#x27;s original themes and several new ones—such as one for the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; that focused on low sounds, with tubas, trombones, and timpani—were integrated into the score. The fight between the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which Davis compared to King Kong&#x27;s fight with dinosaurs in the 1933 film, juxtaposes the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; theme with the one Williams wrote for the &quot;T. rex&quot;. In addition, &quot;Big Hat, No Cattle&quot;, a song by Randy Newman, was used in a restaurant scene. The soundtrack was released in July 2001.

== Marketing and merchandise ==
A teaser trailer of &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; was released online in September 2000, and was also included on DVD releases of the previous films. The first image from the film was released four months later. Universal avoided excessive early marketing to prevent a possible backlash; the studio believed awareness of the film was already sufficient. Marketing began in April 2001, three months before the film&#x27;s release. The first footage from the film was aired during the second-season finale of &quot;Survivor&quot; in May 2001, and the official website went online at the end of June. Promotional partners included Kodak and the Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took place in the United States, although children&#x27;s meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger King outlets.

A novelization by Scott Ciencin, aimed at young children, was published, as well. Ciencin also wrote three children&#x27;s books to tie in with the film&#x27;s events: &quot;Jurassic Park Adventures: Survivor&quot;, the first book, details the eight weeks Eric spent alone on Isla Sorna; &quot;Jurassic Park Adventures: Prey&quot; has Eric and Alan returning to Isla Sorna to rescue a group of teenage filmmakers; and &quot;Jurassic Park Adventures: Flyers&quot; involves Eric and Alan leading the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; home after they nest in a Universal Studios theme park.

In early 2001, Hasbro released a line of action figures including electronic dinosaurs, humans, and vehicles, to coincide with the film&#x27;s release. The figures were scaled down from the previous &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; toy lines produced by Kenner. Other toys were released through the Lego Studios brand, while Playskool released a line called Jurassic Park Junior, aimed at young children.

Several video games were released in 2001. Knowledge Adventure produced three games, &quot;Jurassic Park III: Danger Zone!&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park III: Dino Defender&quot;, and &quot;Scan Command: Jurassic Park&quot;, all for Microsoft Windows. Three others were released by Konami for the Game Boy Advance, including &quot;Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park III: Island Attack&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic Park III: Park Builder&quot;. An arcade game, also titled &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, was released by Konami as well.

In November 2001, to promote the film&#x27;s impending home media release, Universal launched a viral marketing website for Isla Travel, a fictional Isla Sorna travel agency.

===Cell phone promotion===
For the film&#x27;s home media release, Universal partnered with cell-phone company Hop-On to produce &quot;the world&#x27;s first disposable cell phone&quot;, which would have been available through an in-package offer upon purchase of the film. The phones were to be delivered free to customers who responded to a winning promotional card that was supplied with selected copies of the film. Around 5,000 copies of the film contained a winning card, and approximately 1,000 of them were redeemed.

The promotion was cancelled because the handsets could not be finished on time. An investigation by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; revealed that sample versions of Hop-On&#x27;s cell phones were actually modified Nokia handsets; Hop-On was having problems with its own design. Customers who were to receive the cell phones received a $30 check and a free DVD, instead.

==Release==
&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; premiered at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, California, on July 16, 2001; two days later the film was released in the United States and other countries. Neill, a resident of New Zealand, hosted the film&#x27;s Australasian premiere in the city of Dunedin in August.

The film was released on VHS and DVD on December 11, 2001. It was simultaneously released with the previous films as the &quot;Jurassic Park Trilogy&quot; box collection, followed by the &quot;Jurassic Park Adventure Pack&quot; in November 2005. In 2011, the film was released as part of the &quot;Jurassic Park: Ultimate Trilogy&quot; Blu-ray collection. &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; is also included in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; 4K UHD Blu-ray collection, which was released on May 22, 2018.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; grossed $19 million on its opening day. At the time, it had the second-highest Wednesday opening of any film, after &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. In just five days, it generated a total of $80.9 million. The film had also grossed $50.3 million during its three-day opening weekend. When the film opened, it had the third-highest July opening weekend, behind &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. This marked the first time that four consecutive films had made an opening weekend over $45 million, joining &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;American Pie 2&quot;. Additionally, it was one of the four consecutive Universal films of 2001 to gross $40 million in their opening weekends, with &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; and &quot;American Pie 2&quot; being the others. The film ultimately earned $181.2 million in the United States and $368.8 million worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. Despite this, it is the lowest-grossing film in the franchise.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 49% based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; is darker and faster than its predecessors, but that doesn&#x27;t quite compensate for the franchise&#x27;s continuing creative decline.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale. On Metacritic, it was the lowest-rated film of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise until the release of &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot; in 2022 and remains the lowest rated film in the original &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; trilogy. The film&#x27;s distributor Universal did not allow reviews to be published until the film&#x27;s release.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman, who praised the previous &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films, awarded the third film a C grade, writing &quot;&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; has no pretensions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it&#x27;s such a routine ride. Spielberg&#x27;s wizardry is gone, and his balletic light touch as well, and that gives too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters&quot;. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an all-action, helter-skelter, don&#x27;t-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking&quot;. Ben Varkontine of PopMatters called it &quot;not as good a ride as the first, but a damn sight better than the second&quot;. &quot;Apollo Movie Guide&quot; panned the film as being &quot;almost the same as the first movie&quot; with &quot;no need for new ideas or even a script&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;short, scrappy and intermittently scary&quot;.

On &quot;Ebert and Roeper&quot;, Richard Roeper gave it a Thumbs Down while Roger Ebert awarded a Thumbs Up. In a subsequent review, Ebert called it &quot;the best blockbuster of the Summer&quot;. In his written review, Ebert gave the film three stars and said it &quot;is not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, but in its own B-movie way it&#x27;s a nice little thrill machine&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;I can&#x27;t praise it for its art, but I must not neglect its craft, and on that basis I recommend it&quot;. Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, an early pioneer of the dinosaur-bird connection, said the feather quills added to the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; &quot;looked like a roadrunner&#x27;s toupee&quot;, but conceded that feathers are difficult subjects for computer animation and speculated that &quot;Jurassic Park IV&quot;&#x27;s raptors would have more realistic plumage. Spielberg, according to his spokesman, was &quot;very happy&quot; with Johnston&#x27;s work on the film. In 2002, Crichton said he had not watched the film. Some fans of the series were upset with the decision to kill off the &quot;T. rex&quot; and replace it with a new dinosaur.

=== Retrospective assessments ===
Some later reviews of the film have been positive, with a couple of critics declaring it superior to &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Retrospective reviews have also praised the aviary sequence. Simon Brew, writing for Den of Geek, stated in 2007 that the film has &quot;an efficiency and focus&quot; that was missing in the previous film. He enjoyed the set pieces, but criticized the abrupt ending. Comparing the first film with &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, David Chen of /Film wrote in 2009 that the original managed to &quot;thrill audiences and make them think&quot;, while the latter &quot;did neither particularly well&quot;.

Several critics reviewed the film in 2015, when &quot;Jurassic World&quot; was released. Justin Harp of Digital Spy wrote that despite the shortcomings of &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, it &quot;remains immensely watchable and visually impressive. It manages to strike a clear balance between moments of terror and genuine laughs&quot;. Although Harp considered the film to be the black sheep of the series, he described it as &quot;fresh, exciting and, most of all, a whole lot of fun&quot;. Matt Goldberg of Collider wrote that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t really have any reason to exist beyond proving that the franchise maybe never should have been a franchise to begin with&quot;. He stated that the film &quot;is overly excited to let you know [the raptors] can vocally speak to each other, which ends up just looking funny. It feels like we&#x27;re missing subtitles&quot;. Zaki Hasan of Sequart Organization enjoyed the film, but wrote that it has issues such as the abrupt ending.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in 2018, wrote &quot;what the plot lacks in credibility it makes up for with relatability&quot;. The magazine praised it as the only film in the series that &quot;has zero to do with scientific stupidity or sinister corporate forces&quot;, writing that it was &quot;perhaps the most narratively original&quot; film out of all them. Neill said in 2021 that he believes the film is &quot;dismissed too easily&quot;, opining that it is &quot;pretty damn good&quot; aside from the final 10 minutes and &quot;hurried&quot; ending.

===Accolades===

== Sequel ==

The next film in the series, &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, was released in 2015, after a lengthy development period. It was directed by Colin Trevorrow, with Spielberg again serving as executive producer. It launched the &quot;Jurassic World&quot; trilogy. Neill and Dern reprised their roles in the third installment, &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot;, released in 2022.

<doc id="473277" wikidata="Q6541336" url="?curid=473277" title="Libertarian National Convention">
<text>The Libertarian National Convention is held every two years by the Libertarian Party (United States) to choose members of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), and to conduct other party business. In presidential election years, the convention delegates enact a platform and nominate the Libertarian presidential and vice-presidential candidates who then face the nominees of other parties in the November general election.

While most delegates to the Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention are tied to particular candidates, delegates to the Libertarian National Convention are free to choose, as was previously the case for the larger parties. Accordingly, Libertarian National Conventions place less emphasis on festivities and spinning the press, though some of each may be found. The complete convention is televised by C-SPAN with additional broadcast television coverage of the presidential nominating process. None of the above is always an option on all ballots.

==Conventions==

The 1973 Convention was held in Strongsville, Ohio, from June 8 to 10. Over 175 were in attendance.

A second international standard on quantities and units was IEC 60027. The ISO 31 and IEC 60027 Standards were revised by the two standardization organizations in collaboration (, ) to integrate both standards into a joint standard &quot;ISO/IEC 80000 - Quantities and Units&quot; in which the quantities and equations used with SI are to be referred as the &quot;International System of Quantities&quot; (ISQ). ISO/IEC 80000 supersedes both ISO 31 and part of IEC 60027.

<text>Agenda-setting theory suggests that the communications media, through their ability to identify and publicize issues, play a pivotal role in shaping the problems that attract attention from governments and international organizations, and direct public opinion towards specific issues. The theory suggests that the media can shape public opinion by determining what issues are given the most attention, and has been widely studied and applied to various forms of media. The way news stories and topics that impact public opinion are presented is influenced by the media. It is predicated on the idea that most individuals only have access to one source of information on most issues: the news media. Since they establish the agenda, they may affect how important some things are seen to be.

The agenda-setting by media is driven by the media&#x27;s bias on things such as politics, economy and culture, etc. Audiences consider an issue to be more significant the more media attention it receives (issue saliency). For instance, even if readers don&#x27;t have strong feelings about immigration, they will believe that it is a pressing problem at the time if there is consistent journalistic coverage of it over the period of a few months.

The theory has two core assumptions; the first is that it is the media that controls the reality. The media does not report the reality but instead filters and shapes it. The second assumption is quite akin to the description or definition of agenda-setting theory which states that it is the media that gives importance or saliency to its topics as the more likely the media focuses on certain issues, the more likely the public perceive such issue as important and therefore demands action.

The agenda setting theory can be reflected in the awareness model, priorities model, and salience model. Media&#x27;s agenda setting influences public agenda which in turn influences policy agenda building. There have been three theorized levels for agenda-setting theory that have developed over time; first-level, second-level, and third-level.

== Process of agenda-setting (known as accessibility) ==
Agenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as &quot;accessibility&quot;. Accessibility implies that the frequency and prominence of news media coverage significantly influences the accessibility of specific issues within the audience&#x27;s memory. When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is, they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory, which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most. The agenda-setting effect does not stem from just one or a few messages but instead is due to the collective impact of a very large number of messages, each of which has a different content but all of which target with the same general issue.

== History ==
Agenda-setting theory was formally developed by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Lewis Shaw in a study on the 1968 presidential election deemed &quot;the Chapel Hill study&quot;. McCombs and Shaw demonstrated a strong correlation between one hundred Chapel Hill residents&#x27; thought on what was the most important election issue and what the local news media reported was the most important issue. By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public&#x27;s perceptions, McCombs and Shaw determines the degree to which the media sways public opinion. The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they &quot;should&quot; think about, instead of what they &quot;actually&quot; think. That is, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important.

=== Early research ===

The history of study of agenda-setting can be traced to the first chapter of Walter Lippmann&#x27;s 1922 book, &quot;Public Opinion&quot;. In that chapter, &quot;The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads&quot;, Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. Without using the term &quot;agenda-setting&quot;, Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call &quot;agenda-setting&quot;. According to Lippmann, the public responds not to actual events in the environment but to the pseudo-environment, which is a term referring to “the pictures in our heads.”

“For the real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeing for direct acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety, so much variety, so many permutations and combinations. And although we have to act in that environment, we have to reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage with it.” The media step in and essentially set the agenda, offering simpler models by which people can make sense of the world.

Following Lippmann&#x27;s 1922 book, Bernard Cohen observed (in 1963) that the press &quot;may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think &quot;about&quot;. The world will look different to different people,&quot; Cohen continues, &quot;depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.&quot;

As early as the 1960s, Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda-setting theory by McCombs and Shaw. The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict, terrorism, crime and drug issues within the United States. Those that do not include or involve the United States and politics associate negatively with public opinion.

Although Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field, he was exposed to Cohen&#x27;s work while serving as a faculty member at UCLA, and it was Cohen&#x27;s work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw. The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann&#x27;s idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters&#x27; agenda. They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters&#x27; agenda. McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda. The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.

An unknown scholar named G. Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw&#x27;s around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory. McCombs, Shaw, and Funkhouser presented their findings at the same academic conference. Funkhouser&#x27;s article was published later than McCombs and Shaw&#x27;s, and Funkhouser does not receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting. According to Everett Rogers, there are two main reasons for this. First, Funkhouser did not formally name the theory. Second, Funkhouser did not pursue his research much past the initial article. Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at Stanford, cut off from interested researchers, whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research.

=== Development of agenda-setting theory ===

By comparing and developing the salience of issues in news content with the public&#x27;s perceptions of the most important election issue, McCombs and Shaw were able to determine the degree to which the media determines public opinion. Since the 1968 &quot;Chapel Hill&quot; study, published in a 1972 edition of &quot;Public Opinion Quarterly&quot;, more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda-setting function of the mass media, and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant.

== Three models of agenda-setting ==

Three models describe the agenda-setting process:

# &quot;Awareness model&quot;
# &quot;Priorities model&quot;
# &quot;Salience model&quot;

The research on the effect of agenda-setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue. Then it analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media. There are three models proposed by Max McCombs: the &quot;awareness model&quot;, the &quot;priorities model&quot; and the &quot;salience model&quot;. Most investigations are centered on these three models.

=== Awareness model ===
The awareness model proposes that an issue is on an individual’s agenda because they have seen it in the media. If the media does not report on an issue or topic, then it will most likely not be thought about by an individual. For example, if the media reports on Topic X, an individual is more likely to be aware of Topic X over Topic Y.

=== Priorities model ===
The priorities model is a way of looking at the process that explicitly describes where our priorities lie. The issues the media prioritizes will likely be prioritized by the individuals as well. For example, if the media reports on Topic X, an individual will care about Topic X and its updates (even if Topic Y is more pressing, it is not being reported on).

=== Salience model ===
The salience model lies somewhere in between the awareness model and the priorities model. In this model, individuals’ agendas do not exactly reflect the media’s agendas. However, some issues or topics that are consistently presented in the media will appear at the top of individuals’ agendas. For example, if the media reports on Topic X, an individual will care about Topic X to a lesser extent than the media cares.

Most research on agenda-setting are based on the following:

# the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;
# media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.

== Three types of agenda-setting: Policy-makers, media and audience ==

Research shows that the media agenda, audience agenda and policy agenda influence the agenda setting as described in the following section. Rogers and Dearing describe how following types of agenda setting (dependent variable in research) are influenced by other factors:
# &quot;Policy agenda-setting&quot; or &quot;Political agenda setting&quot;
# &quot;Media agenda-setting&quot; or &quot;Agenda building&quot;
# &quot;Public/Audience agenda-setting&quot;
Studies have shown that what the media decides to expose correlates with their views on things such as politics, economy and culture. Aside from bias, other critics of the news media claim that news in the United States has become a form of entertainment. Instead of providing the public with the information they need, journalists instead strive to fill the publics&#x27; appetite for shocking and sensational headlines. Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure. Financial resources, technologies, foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality.

Mass communication research, Rogers and Dearing argue, has focused a great deal on &quot;public agenda setting&quot; (e.g. McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and &quot;media agenda setting&quot;, but has largely ignored &quot;policy agenda setting&quot;, which is studied primarily by political scientists. As such, the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker&#x27;s agendas (i.e. scholars should ask where the President or members of the U.S. Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies). Writing in 2006, Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing&#x27;s suggestions, creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting, which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers&#x27; agendas.

Three steps of the agenda setting theory influence how the media presents information to the public and how the media tells the public what to think about. Once the media tells the public what to think about, the more policy is enacted.

=== Media agenda ===
The media agenda refers to the most important consideration of discussed issues in negotiated sources. The result of this agenda directly influences the public agenda, which also influences the policy agenda. However, the power of the media agenda depends on certain factors to include media credibility, conflicting evidence, the extent of shared values between the people and the media, and the publics need for guidance.

There are several negative statements that people have to say about the way this theory affects the media. One complaint is that “media users are not ideal.” This is because sometimes people do not focus on details. The second complain is that “the effect is weakened for people who have made up their mind.” This is something that is also true. Lastly, the complain is that “media cannot create problems.” The problems occur through media but media is not the problem. [106]

=== Public agenda ===
The public agenda is what the media agenda wants the public to think about through the interaction of mass media. This type of agenda influences the public through personal experience and interpersonal communication. The indicators of real world events directly influence what the public thinks about and the importance of an agenda issue or an event. This agenda interacts with what is considered important by policymakers to create the policy agenda.

Public media has to deal with Political Communication as well. A fun fact is that “the agenda setting theory was formally developed by McCombs and Shaw (1972) when they studied the US Presidential Election of 1968.” [107]

=== Policy Agenda ===
The policy agenda is directly related to both the media and public agenda, and is the last step in the agenda setting process. The agenda itself relates to policy and makes reference to the public agenda while it interacts with what policy makers believe.

==== Guidance and orientation ====
A contingency condition of the Agenda Setting Theory consists of two variables: &quot;Relevance&quot; and &quot;Uncertainty&quot;.

* Relevance is described as a motivation to seek orientation on an issue from the media due to the perception of personal importance that the issue holds for someone.
* Uncertainty is described as how much information people think they have about an issue.
* If people believe what they have is a great deal of information on a specific piece of media information regarding a topic, their uncertainty is low and will not need guidance.
* If people are unsure if they have enough information on a specific piece of media information regarding a topic, they will need more guidance from the medias present agenda. The variables interact with one another to explain deviations from the general principles of the Agenda Setting Theory.

=== Effect of Media Fragmentation and Individual Consumption Patterns on Agenda-Setting ===
Media fragmentation and individual consumption patterns have become vital in understanding how agenda-setting works within today&#x27;s society.

==== &quot;Media Fragmentation&quot; ====
The idea of a unified public agenda faces increasing challenges with the constant evolution of the media landscape. The rise of diverse news sources and platforms has led to a more fragmented media environment, where people selectively consume content aligning with their interests and beliefs.This fragmentation has significant implications as research indicates agenda diversity, the level of disagreement over what issues are most important, has increased dramatically in recent years. This trend is largely attributed to high-choice media environments which allow individuals to avoid news on topics they find less engaging.

==== &quot;Individual Media Consumption Patterns&quot; ====
Individual consumption patterns have become increasingly more important in shaping personal agendas. Studies suggest most individual agendas are not consistent with traditional public agendas, emphasizing the need to consider personal influence in the social media era. As a result, agenda-setting has given rise to the &quot;individual agenda,&quot; reflecting individual issue saliences rather than collective public agendas. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers, as the rise of agenda diversity can create ambiguity in interpreting public priorities, complicating the policymaking process.

==Comparison of agenda-setting with policy agenda-building==
As more scholars published articles on agenda-setting theories it became evident that the process involves not only active role of media organizations, but also participation of the public as well as policymakers. Rogers and Dearing highlighted the distinction between agenda-setting and agenda-building, emphasizing the dominant role of either media or the public. &quot;Setting&quot; an agenda refers to the effect of the media agenda on society, or transfer of the media agenda to the public agenda, while &quot;building&quot; an agenda includes &quot;some degree of reciprocity&quot; between the mass media and society where both media and public agendas influence public policy.

According to Sun Young Lee and Daniel Riffe, the agenda-building theory speculates that the media does not operate within a vacuum. Instead, it is the result of the societal influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of control. While some scholars have attempted to uncover certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has created, others have probed who sets the media agenda. Journalists have limited time and resources that can contribute to outside sources getting involved in the news media&#x27;s gatekeeping process. Many sources can contribute to this agenda-building process in a variety of ways, but researchers are particularly interested in how well informational tools like press releases and media kits function within the news media agenda as a gauge of an organization&#x27;s public relations success.

Berkowitz has implemented an extensive analysis of agenda-setting and agenda-building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda-setting and policy agenda-building. He argues that the term of policy agenda-setting is still appropriate to use when scholars focus solely on the relationship between the media and policymakers. However, when the focus is placed not only on policymakers&#x27; personal agendas, but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment, Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda-building.

=== Agenda-building ===
The agenda-building perspective emphasizes the interplay between mass media, policymakers, and social processes, recognizing ongoing mass involvement&#x27;s influence on the policy-making process. Cobb and Elder assert that while the public can influence the media agenda, they do not significantly shape it; instead, journalists anticipate audience needs when generating story ideas.

This idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the rise of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a media content creator. Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today&#x27;s world. Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard.

Kim and Lee noted that the agenda-setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda-setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents&#x27; and users&#x27; interactivity.

According to Kim and Lee, agenda-building through the Internet take the following three steps: 1) Internet-mediated agenda-rippling: an anonymous netizen&#x27;s opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs, personal homepages, and the Internet bulletin boards. 2) agenda diffusion in the Internet: online news or web-sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics. 3) Internet-mediated reversed agenda-setting: traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics.

Several studies provide evidence that the Internet-community, particularly bloggers, can push their own agenda into public agenda, then media agenda, and, eventually, into policy agenda. In the most comprehensive study to date, Wallsten tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of 35 issues during the 2004 presidential campaign. Using time-series analysis, Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about. There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda. For instance, in 2005 Eason Jordan, the chief news executive at CNN, abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying, according to various witnesses, that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed 12 of them. Similarly, in 2002, Trent Lott had to resign as Senate majority leader due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere.

=== Agenda-setting ===
Some groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others. For instance, policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists&#x27; needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness. Government-affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local, state, and national levels. News sources can also provide definitions of issues, thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways

The relationship of media and policymakers is symbiotic and is controlled by the shared culture of unofficial set of ground rules as journalists need access to official information and policymakers need media coverage; nevertheless the needs of journalists and policymakers are often incompatible because of their different time orientation as powerful sources are at their best in routine situations and react more slowly when crisis or disaster occur. Consequently, policymakers who understand the rules of this culture the best will be most capable of setting their agendas and issue definitions. Simultaneously, media also influences policymakers when government officials and politicians value the amount of media attention given to an issue as an indirect indication of public interest in the issue.

== Academic research on agenda-setting theory ==
=== Review of studies on agenda-setting theory ===
Various critiques have been made of agenda-setting theory:
*Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories, resulting in inflated correlation coefficients.
*The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes a passive position. However, the public is not as passive as the theory assumed. Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience.

===Additional factors to be considered in agenda-setting research===
==== Impact of media on audience and quantum of impact on individuals in audience ====
In an attempt to overcome mirror-image effects of agenda-setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience, several scholars proposed that the model of agenda-setting should include individual/collective audience characteristics or real-world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance. They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of media impact and proposed a model of &quot;audience effects&quot;. According to the audience-effects model, media coverage interacts with the audience&#x27;s pre-existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns. Thus, media effects are contingent on issue-specific audience characteristics.

Another factor that causes variations in the correlation between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is &quot;obtrusive&quot; or &quot;unobtrusive&quot;; i.e., whether it has a high or low issue threshold. Obtrusive, or issues with low threshold, are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience (e.g. citywide crime or increases in gasoline prices). This type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media. In regard to unobtrusive issues, this means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media&#x27;s influence on public opinion on that issue.

===Theory development in agenda-setting research===
==== Second-level agenda-setting: attribute agenda setting ====
Over time, agenda-setting theory evolved to include additional dimensions outside of the initial object salience level (specific issues, public figures, etc.). A second-level is now included which focuses on how the news media influences public opinion on the attributes of those objects. This is based around the selection of what attributes to present when covering certain issues or people. Balmas and Sheafer (2010) argued that the focus at the first level agenda-setting which emphasizes media&#x27;s role in telling us &quot;what to think about&quot; is shifted to media&#x27;s function of telling us &quot;how to think about&quot; at the second level agenda-setting. The second level of agenda-setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion (McCombs &amp; Evatt, 1995). Furthermore, Ghanem(1997) demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance, drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda. For example, media coverage of a political candidate&#x27;s experience would be included in the substantive dimension of second-level agenda-setting, whereas the attitude toward the candidate&#x27;s experience (positive, negative, or neutral) would be included in the affective dimension.

===== Second-level agenda-setting vs. framing =====
There is a debate over whether framing theory should be subsumed within agenda-setting as &quot;second-level agenda-setting&quot;. McCombs, Shaw, Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda-setting that operates as a &quot;second-level&quot; or secondary effect. Dietram Scheufele has argued the opposite. Scheufele argues that framing and agenda-setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries, operate via distinct cognitive processes (accessibility vs. attribution), and relate to different outcomes (perceptions of issue importance vs. interpretation of news issue).

One example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon&#x27;s involvement in the watergate scandal. According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang, the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President&#x27;s involvement. It was not until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed. This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public&#x27;s opinions. It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping, similar to the agenda setting theory. 
According to Weaver, framing and second-level agenda setting have the following characteristics:

Similarities are

# Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported.
# Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest.
# Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking

Differences are

# Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes – moral evaluations, causal reasoning, appeals to principle, and recommendations for treatment of problems – than does second-level agenda-setting (the salience of attributes of an object). Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that &quot;framing differs significantly from these accessibility-based models [i.e., agenda setting and priming]. It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences;&quot; the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it. Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of news production, information processing and media effects.
# News production: Although &quot;both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects&quot;, frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building. In other words, &quot;how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda-setting one.&quot;
# News processing: For framing and agenda-setting, different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects. Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages, while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages.
# Locus of effect: Agenda-setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media, while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store.

Based on these shared characteristics, McCombs and colleagues recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting. In other words, according to them, the premise that framing is about selecting &quot;a restricted number of thematically related attributes&quot; for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda setting). That is, according to McCombs and colleagues&#x27; arguments, framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting.

==== Third-level agenda-setting: network agenda setting model ====
The most recent agenda-setting studies explore &quot;the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public&quot;. That is, researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda, but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another. Based on that, Guo, Vu and McCombs (2012) bring up a new theoretical model called Network Agenda Setting Model, which they refer to as the third-level agenda-setting. This model shows that &quot;the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public&#x27;s mind simultaneously&quot;. In other words, elements in people&#x27;s mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate. Instead, they are interconnected with each other to make a network-like structure in one&#x27;s mind, and if the news media always mention two elements together, the audience will &quot;perceive these two elements as interconnected&quot;.

===== The dimension of emotion =====
According to the theory of affective intelligence, &quot;emotions enhance citizen rationality&quot;. It argues that emotions, particularly negative ones, are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views. Based on that, Renita Coleman and H. Denis Wu (2010) study whether the TV portrayals of candidates impacts people&#x27;s political judgment during the 2004 U.S. presidential Election. They find that apart from the cognitive assessment, which is commonly studied before, emotion is another critical dimension of the second-level affects in agenda-setting. Three conclusions are presented: the media&#x27;s emotional-affective agenda corresponds with the public&#x27;s emotional impressions of candidates; negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions; and agenda-setting effects are greater on the audiences&#x27; emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits.

====Hierarchy of effects theory====
Coleman and Wu (2009) emphasized the similarities between the hierarchy of effects theory and agenda-setting theory, and how the latter can be used to analyze the former. The hierarchy of effects theory has three components: knowledge, attitude, and behavior, also known as &quot;learn, feel, do.&quot; The first level of agenda-setting, such as a policy issue gaining public attention, corresponds to the &quot;knowledge&quot; component of the hierarchy of effects theory. The second level of agenda-setting, such as how the public views or feels about a policy issue, corresponds to the &quot;attitude&quot; component. Coleman and Wu&#x27;s study is not so much focused on the order of these components, but instead on which component, knowledge (level one) and attitude (level two), has a greater effect on public behavior.

== Application of agenda-setting theory for the study of various topics ==
=== In the United States ===

==== Use of Twitter in political agenda setting ====
Agenda setting theory has been particularly useful in the analysis of politicians’ use of social media in the United States. A 2016 study of several thousand tweets from U.S. Governors used the first two levels of agenda-setting theory (issue level and framing) in order to better understand how politicians used Twitter as a platform. The research found that Democrats and Republicans used Twitter in nearly equal amounts to communicate their agendas, but Democrats were not as aligned in the agendas they prioritized. A later study found that newspapers and Twitter have a reciprocal relationship when it comes to predicting national policy issues during elections.

====Non-political application====
McCombs and Shaw originally established agenda-setting within the context of a presidential election and there have been numerous studies regarding agenda setting and politics. However, more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brands. The theory can also be applied to commercial advertising, business news and corporate reputation, business influence on federal policy, legal systems, trials, roles of social groups, audience control, public opinion, and public relations.
* Agenda-setting in business communication: Corporate ranking systems have an agenda setting effect; when a business is highly ranked in these systems they are often displayed in the news media, which in turn keeps them in the minds of the public.
* Agenda-setting in advertising: Ghorpade demonstrated media&#x27;s agenda-setting can &quot;go beyond the transfer of silence to the effect of intended behavior&quot; and is thus relevant to advertising.
* Agenda-setting in interpersonal communication: Those who rely on mass media for news influence those who mostly rely on interpersonal communication in regards to agendas. One study found that even those who rely on interpersonal communication for their news still share the same agenda that is prolific in the news media due to peers disseminating that agenda.
* Agenda-setting in health communication: Ogata Jones, Denham and Springston (2006) studied the mass and interpersonal communication on breast cancer screening practice and found that mass media is essential in &quot;setting an agenda for proactive health behaviors&quot;. Women who were directly or indirectly exposed to news articles about breast cancer tended to conduct more frequent screenings than those had not read such articles. Additional research shows that effectively using social media platforms encourages health promotion and intervention as opposed to the traditional communicative strategies.
* Agenda setting and non-profit organizations: A study done in 2013 on the correlation between media coverage of natural disasters, the public’s attention to the disaster, and donations to non-profit organizations for disaster relief showed a strong positive correlation between media coverage and public response to the disaster.

===Study of topics outside the U.S.===
====Europe====
In Europe, agenda-setting theory has been applied in a similar way to research in the United States. McCombs and Maxwell also investigated agenda-setting theory in the context of the 1995 regional and municipal elections in Spain.

====China====
Guoliang, Shao and Bowman found that agenda-setting effects in China are not as strong as in the Western world.

Another study found that in modern China, internet public opinion has emerged as a rival agenda-setting power to traditional media.

====Japan====
In an analysis of the policy making process concerning temporary labor migration to Japan, researchers observed how migrant advocacy organizations influence public opinion through agenda setting, priming and framing, which had a limiting effect on the impact of other interest groups.

====Saudi Arabia====
A 2015 study found that social media is influential in the setting of the public agenda due to widespread dissemination and facilitation of the agendas of individuals.

=== Future research topics (presently understudied) ===

==== Empowerment-of-masses and decentralizing impact of Internet ====

The advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda-setting effects online. Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened. Others think that the agenda-setting process and its role have continued on the Internet, specifically in electronic bulletin boards. Popular handles on social media sites such as Twitter can choose what they want their followers to see. Users can also choose which accounts they want to follow and news they want to see on any social media platform. While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists&#x27; ability to set the agenda, there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking.

Traditional media such as newspapers and broadcast television are &quot;vertical media&quot; in which authority, power and influence come from the &quot;top&quot; and flow &quot;down&quot; to the public. Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of &quot;horizontal media&quot; – new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence, which means the media is &quot;distributed horizontally instead of top-down&quot;.

==== Agenda-melding ====


Agenda-melding focuses on how individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group. Groups and communities represent a &quot;collected agenda of issues&quot; and &quot;one joins a group by adopting an agenda&quot;. Now with the ease of access to media, people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with.

The advances in technology have made agenda-melding accessible for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas. The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them. In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited.

==== Agenda-cutting ====
One concept in the context of agenda-setting theory is the concept of agenda-cutting. Colistra defines agenda-cutting as the attempt to direct attention away from relevant issues “(1) by placing an item low on the news agenda (burying it), (2) by removing it from agenda once it is there, or (3) by completely ignoring it by never placing it on the agenda in the first place”. Agenda-cutting is mainly seen to occur to news issues that are significant and controversial. Agenda-cutting needs to be motivated by the deliberate intention to drop a news issue from the agenda; a case of news omission does not qualify for agenda-cutting but rather constitutes a result of news selection (which tries to differentiate between the relevant and the irrelevant).

Despite being first mentioned in the 1980s by Mallory Wober and Barrie Gunter, agenda-cutting has only been sporadically taken up in scholarly research. One reason for the academic neglect of this concept is seen in the fact that there have been only few empirical investigations on the one hand, while no sufficient theoretical basis has been established on the other. First steps towards conceptualizing and operationalizing agenda-cutting have been put forward by Buchmeier.

Other studies shed light on the editorial processes in the newsroom which potentially lead to agenda-cutting. There are two non-profit media watchdog organizations whose mission is to draw attention to neglected and censored issues in the news: Project Censored in the US and INA (Initiative News Enlightenment) in Germany.

<text>&quot;Texas, Our Texas&quot; is the regional anthem of the U.S. state of Texas, adopted in the late 1920s as the official state song.

==History==
It was written in 1924 by William J. Marsh, who was born in Liverpool, United Kingdom, and emigrated to Texas as a young man, and Gladys Yoakum Wright (1891–1956), of Fort Worth, Texas. It was selected as the official state song by a concurrent resolution of the Texas Legislature in 1929 following a statewide competition. Older songs, such as &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot;, were also considered but ultimately it was decided a new song should be composed.

Although the song has been sung since the 41st legislature in 1929, it was officially adopted by the 73rd legislature as the state song in 1993.

The song is usually performed just after the national anthem with a display of the flag. In the absence of the flag, those present during the song&#x27;s performance are expected to face toward the music and act just as they would if the flag had been present.

The first word of the third line was originally &quot;largest&quot;, but when Alaska became the largest U.S. state when it was admitted to the United States in 1959, the word was replaced with &quot;boldest&quot;.

This song was sung in group by elementary students in Texas at the beginning of their school classes during the 1950s. As late as the 1990s, this song was still sung before classes in some schools, along with the pledge to the U.S. and Texan flags.

&lt;poem&gt;
I
Texas, our Texas! All hail the mighty State!
Texas, our Texas! So wonderful so great!
Boldest and grandest, Withstanding ev&#x27;ry test;
O Empire wide and glorious, You stand supremely blest.
𝄆 God bless you Texas! And keep you brave and strong,
That you may grow in power and worth,
Thro&#x27;out the ages long. 𝄇

II
Texas, O Texas! Your freeborn single star,
Sends out its radiance to nations near and far.
Emblem of freedom! It sets our hearts aglow,
With thoughts of San Jacinto and glorious Alamo.

III
Texas, dear Texas! From tyrant grip now free,
Shines forth in splendor your star of destiny!
Mother of heroes! We come your children true,
Proclaiming our allegiance, our faith, our love for you.
&lt;/poem&gt;
