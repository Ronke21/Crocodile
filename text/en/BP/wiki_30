<text>The Bronx Kill is a narrow strait in New York City delineating the southernmost extent of the Bronx. It separates the Bronx from Randalls Island. It connects the Harlem River to the East River.

==History==
Originally, the Bronx Kill was a sizeable waterway, approximately in width. As of 1917, there were also plans by the War Department to dredge a deep channel, in width, to improve navigation and reduce tidal currents. For this reason, in the early 20th century the New York Connecting Railroad built a movable bridge across the Bronx Kill on the approach to the Hell Gate Bridge. Similarly, the truss bridge of the Triborough Bridge across the Bronx Kill was designed to be convertible to a lift bridge. However, much of the Bronx Kill was later filled in to expand the parkland on Randalls Island.

==Navigation==
The Bronx Kill offers a venue for kayakers and other human-powered boaters without the worry of larger vessel traffic. Canoe and kayak expeditions through the waterway begin on the Harlem River, near the Third Avenue Bridge. Crossings must be well timed for the tides, to ensure both the correct current direction and sufficient water height: at low water, parts of the Bronx Kill entirely bottom out, revealing muddy stretches, and assorted debris. There is also low air draft under the Randalls Island Connector. Consequently, no commercial vessels navigate the kill, with local businesses mostly opting instead for road and rail transport, including the Oak Point Link along its north bank.

== 21st century ==
In 2001, the New York Power Authority offered to construct a pedestrian bridge linking the Bronx with Randalls Island—part of the agency&#x27;s remuneration to the community for building two new power plants in the South Bronx. That plan, however, fell by the wayside when local officials argued that an improved Triborough Bridge path would be sufficient. The state authority instead paid for energy efficiency measures in the borough as a whole, including a green roof on the Bronx County Courthouse.

At the time, the two sidewalks of the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s Bronx Kill span were connected to one long ramp at the Randalls Island end. This provides difficult access. Following years of negotiation for land with the operators of the Harlem River Yards on the north bank of the Kill, the Randalls Island Connector bridge was constructed across the Kill. The $6 million bridge, located underneath Amtrak&#x27;s Hell Gate Bridge, provides pedestrian and bicycle access between the island and the Port Morris neighborhood of the Bronx and to the South Bronx Greenway. The connector opened in November 2015.

A 2006 plan for a water park—the first in the nation for a large city—on the northwest corner of Randalls Island was controversial. Announced by the Giuliani administration as a $48 million, project, the proposal expanded to encompass at a projected cost of $168 million before being cancelled in 2007.

<text>An amendment is a formal or official change made to a law, contract, constitution, or other legal document. It is based on the verb to amend, which means to change for better. Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements. They are often used when it is better to change the document than to write a new one. Only the legislative branch is involved in the amendment process.

== Contracts ==
Contracts are often amended when the market changes. For example, a contract to deliver something to a customer once a month can be amended if the customer wants it delivered once a week. Usually
Contracts also are categorized for their promotion in a nation, such as the Treaty of Versailles.

== Law ==
=== Legislation ===
In parliamentary procedure, a motion is a proposal to do something. The wording of such a proposal can be changed with a motion to amend. Amendments can remove words, add words, or change words in motions. All main motions and some secondary motions can be amended. An amendment can be amended.

=== Constitutions ===
Some of the most famous constitutional amendments are the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which added the freedom of speech, religion, press, and protest, the Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which let Ireland join the European Union, and the amendment of the German constitution as part of the German reunification process in 1990. Constitutional amendments in some countriesfor example, Australiamust be approved by both the parliament or legislature and a national referendum.

<doc id="472064" wikidata="Q194446" url="?curid=472064" title="Canna, Scotland">
<text>Canna (; ) is the westernmost of the Small Isles archipelago, in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. It is linked to the neighbouring island of Sanday by a road and sandbanks at low tide. The island is long and wide. The isolated skerries of Hyskeir and Humla lie south-west of the island.

The islands were left to the National Trust for Scotland by their previous owners, the highly important Celtic studies scholars John Lorne Campbell and Margaret Fay Shaw, in 1981, and are run as a farm and conservation area. Canna House, one of two big houses on the island (the other being Tighard), contains Shaw and Campbell&#x27;s important archives of Scottish Gaelic literature, folklore, and folk song materials that were donated with the islands to the nation. Since then the National Trust has engaged in new initiatives to attract new residents and visitors to Canna. However, these initiatives have enjoyed only limited success, and in December 2017 it was announced that the trust would be devolving to the island community the responsibility for attracting and retaining new residents.

== Facilities ==
There are some 20 buildings on Canna and Sanday, including three churches, one of which has been deconsecrated (see below). There is also a post office which was converted from a garden shed. The Canna tea room, which closed in 2008, reopened in 2010 as the Gille Brighde Cafe and Restaurant. This restaurant closed in 2013 but has since re-opened again as Cafe Canna. A new resident manager for the island was appointed in 2010. The island is isolated and in the past inhabitants have had to buy all their provisions from the mainland, but it now has a small unstaffed shop operated on an &#x27;honesty&#x27; basis. There is a telephone link, a red telephone box and broadband internet access, although there is no mobile phone coverage. Electricity is provided by a diesel generator, at mainland voltage and frequency, and there is a private water supply. In 2010 a proposal to establish a fish farm off Canna was defeated in a residents&#x27; ballot, even though it would have created a number of new jobs.

The island has a very low crime rate, but a mainland-based police officer visits the island twice a year, mainly to inspect gun licences. A doctor based on the neighbouring island of Skye is available for house calls once a month. The roads on Canna are not metalled and are privately owned; local vehicles therefore do not require road tax. The previous footbridge to Sanday was destroyed by storms during 2005, and has recently been replaced by a road bridge. This allows vehicular access at all tide levels for the first time, although the road on Sanday is still covered by high tides. However, in 2017 an appeal was launched to raise funds for the reconstruction of the road on Sanday so that it is also available at high tide.

== Geology ==
In contrast to neighbouring Rùm, the geology of Canna is very much a layered sequence of basalt lava flows of Palaeocene age, all ascribed to the Canna Lava Formation. Many are of hawaiitic composition. Within the lower half of the succession there are also coarse conglomerates deposited by rivers
The island is traversed by numerous normal faults most of which run broadly north–south. Basalt dykes ascribed to the North Britain Palaeogene Dyke Suite are seen in the east of the island. 
Quaternary deposits include glacial till of limited extent around Tarbert and screes which are found beneath various of the small basalt cliffs. Pleistocene and Holocene raised beach deposits are frequent around Canna&#x27;s coastline, some being late glacial and others post-glacial in age.

== Wildlife ==
Canna is renowned for its wildlife, including sea eagles, golden eagles and puffins. Recently, peregrine falcons and merlins have also been sighted. The island is also inhabited by a number of rare butterfly species. In the nearby waters one can spot dolphins and smaller whales.

Canna is noted for its tiers of basalt pillars that rise over the eastern half of the island and the sea cliffs that dominate its northern shore. The highest point on the island is Càrn a&#x27; Ghaill (Scottish Gaelic for &quot;rocky hill of the storm&quot;) at . Another point of interest is Compass Hill. Its peak is at and sits on the eastern edge of the island. It is made of volcanic rock called tuff, and it has such a high iron content that the compass of nearby ships are distorted, pointing to the hill rather than north.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

Canna is littered with numerous pottery sherds evidencing the island&#x27;s occupation in the Neolithic era, along with a small number of mysterious cellars dug into the ground. A distinctively shaped standing stone is found at Keill, around which a local legend has grown: according to the legend, when people on Canna were badly behaved, they would be punished by having their thumb jammed into a particular hole in the stone, at about 6&#x27;4&quot; above ground level (hence the stone&#x27;s name - the &quot;punishment stone&quot;).
Bronze Age remains are some of the most extensive in the North-Western Highlands, particularly at the western end of the island; these include fragments of huts arranged in circles, and ancient field walls, as well as pottery artefacts from the Beaker Culture. In the Iron Age a hillfort - Dun Channa - was constructed at the far western edge of Canna; another was probably constructed at the eastern edge, at Coroghon, in the same period. 
=== Early Christian period ===

In the 6th century, when the Irish missionary Columba first sailed to Iona, he first arrived at the island of &quot;Hinba&quot;, which he later treated to as a place of contemplative retreat. The extensive early Christian sculptures and structures on Canna, and its traditional association with Iona, have made many consider it to be the otherwise unidentified &quot;Hinba&quot;. However, Adomnán (the chronicler of the life of Columba) noted that Brendan the Navigator stopped at &quot;Hinba&quot; while travelling from Ireland to Iona; Canna is a most unlikely landfall on such a journey as it is well beyond the destination.
At Keill are two large richly decorated Celtic crosses, dating from the 8th to 9th centuries, which are thought to attest to the presence of a monastery. A cursing stone, was located at the site; a device normally associated with Ireland, this only the second cursing stone ever to be found in Scotland.
On the south coast of the island are the remains of a small, isolated, cashel-like building, which would have been difficult to supply with provisions, except by sea. In Gaelic the site is known as &quot;Sgorr nam Ban-naomha&quot;, meaning &quot;grassy slope of the holy women&quot;; in the 19th century, local people believed it had once been a nunnery, but it is now thought to have been a hermitage, associated with the monastery at Keill. The enclosure contains three carved stones, bearing crosses, and was once believed to have had a healing spring.

=== Norse rule ===

Following raids by the Vikings in the 9th century, the Hebrides became part of the Kingdom of the Isles, a Norwegian crown dependency also known as &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (&quot;Southern Isles&quot;). Written records are few, but the Viking occupation of Canna is evident from place names such as the element &quot;sgor&quot;, &quot;gearaid&quot; (enclosure), &quot;tota&quot; (homestead) and Sanday (&quot;sand island&quot;) (though the name &quot;Canna&quot; itself may pre-date the Norse period).

A number of large oblong arrangements of kerb-stones throughout the island are thought to possibly indicate Viking ship burials, based on the evidence of similar structures on the Isle of Arran (which was also part of Suðreyjar). The largest is located at Rubha Langan-innis on the north coast, and known in Gaelic as &quot;Uaigh Righ Lochlainn&quot; (meaning &quot;the grave of the King of Norway&quot;); this is a narrow rectangular structure approximately long by wide on a grassy promontory below the cliffs.

Later accounts imply that the monastery at Keill had been a centre of the Culdees while under Norwegian dominion. In the late 12th century, practical authority in Suðreyjar became split between a number of closely related magnates. In 1203, Ranald, the magnate ruling the portion that contained Iona, invited the Benedictines to establish a new Abbey at Iona; that same year, a papal bull was issued, listing the Island of Canna among the new Abbey&#x27;s possessions. It is likely that the previous Abbey of Iona had had some authority over Canna, perhaps even stretching before the Viking era, but the fact that Norse rulers had not always been Christian may have disrupted Iona&#x27;s authority, and Iona itself may have been deserted by the time Ranald requested a new Abbey.

=== Church rule under the Scottish king ===
In 1266, the Treaty of Perth transferred Suðreyjar to the Scottish king, as a set of crown dependencies - rather than merging it into Scotland itself. Geographically, Canna lay within the portion of the former Suðreyjar which had become the MacRory realm of &quot;Garmoran&quot; (stretching from Uist to the Rough Bounds), but documents relating to Garmoran do treat Canna as part of it, suggesting the island was still under the Abbot&#x27;s control. The Abbot of Iona thus ruled Canna with considerable power. Nevertheless, at the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to Canna.

During the 1420s, feuding within other fragments of Suðreyjar appears to have spilled onto Canna. The Abbot, Dominicus, obtained papal authority to ban all nobility from setting foot on the island, but this wasn&#x27;t respected, and Canna had to be temporarily abandoned. In 1428, the Abbot wrote to the Pope requesting that he pronounce a general excommunication against anyone who harmed one of Canna&#x27;s inhabitants, or damaged their property, claiming:
&quot;by reason of wars and other calamities in the past divers homicides, depredations and other ills were perpetrated, so that some strong men of the familiars of the Abbot and convent were slain by pirates and sea rovers, and divers farmers and inhabitants of the island were afraid to reside there&quot;.
The Reformation was rapidly encroaching, however, and after 1498 Iona was transferred to Commendators, rather than Abbots. Canna became a possession of the Bishop of the Isles (also known as the &quot;Bishop of Sodor&quot;; &quot;Sodor&quot; is the traditional anglicisation of &quot;Suðreyjar&quot;). In 1548, the Dean of the Isles, Donald Monro, conducted a survey of the Bishop&#x27;s lands and churches, reporting that the island was a: &quot;faire maine land, foure myle lange, inhabit and manurit, with paroche kirke in it, guid for corne, fishing and grassing, with a falcon nest in it, pertines to the Abbot of Colmkill&quot;,

In 1561, the Bishop agreed to rent the island to the leader of Clan Ranald, a branch of the MacDonalds. In 1588, some of the remains of the Spanish Armada found refuge with the MacLeans of Duart, who had a longstanding feud with the MacDonalds (concerning the Rhinns of Islay). Lachlan - the MacLean leader - demanded that the Spanish supply him with 100 soldiers, as the price of their refuge, which he used to launch an attack against the Small Isles, in pursuance of the feud; Canna was &quot;burned with fire&quot;. Lachlan was imprisoned in Edinburgh by the king for this, but he escaped, and faced no further punishment.

=== Argyll ===
By the early 17th century, the Bishopric of the Isles was held by Presbyterians, for whom the office of Bishop had a questionable status. In 1626, Thomas Knox, the Bishop, appears to have replaced Clan Ranald (who relunctantly accepted the reformation) as his tenants, with the MacLeods of Raasay (active supporters of the reformation). At the end of his life, in 1627, Thomas Knox sold Canna to the Earl of Argyll, one of the most powerful Covenanters. Under pressure from the Earl, shrieval authority transferred from Inverness to the sheriff of Argyll, which was under the control of the Earl&#x27;s family.

In 1641, following the outbreak of civil war, king Charles I promised to give Canna to the Baronet of Sleat, since the Earl of Argyll&#x27;s treason (as one of the king&#x27;s main opponents) would make Canna forfeit; the king&#x27;s subsequent defeat made this promise moot. In 1654, the war having ended, the Earl of Argyll leased Canna back to Clan Ranald. In the following year, Donald MacDonald, the son of the Clan Ranald leader, married the Baronet&#x27;s daughter, Janet, quelling any potential dispute over the island.
In 1666, following Janet&#x27;s death, Donald married Marion MacLeod of Harris, but by 1680 he was seeking a divorce, accusing her of adultery. At some point in the late 17th century, a small prison (now called &quot;Coroghon Castle&quot;) was constructed on the side of an isolated stack at Coroghon; it was described by Thomas Pennant in 1772 as &quot;a lofty slender rock, that juts into the sea: on one side is a little tower, at a vast height above us, accessible by a narrow and horrible path: it seems so small as scarce to be able to contain half a dozen people. Tradition says, that it was built by some jealous &quot;regulus&quot;, to confine a handsome wife in&quot;.

Donald had succeeded to the leadership of Clan Ranald in 1670, and in 1672 was give a new charter of Lairdship for Canna by the new Earl of Argyll. A decade later, Argyll&#x27;s Rising caused the Earl&#x27;s feudal authority to be forfeit, making Clan Ranald direct vassals of the king. In 1686, Donald died, and was buried on Canna.
=== The Bard ===
Clan Ranald tenants on Canna joined the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and of 1745, and as a consequence were not looked upon favourably by the king&#x27;s forces.

According to the Clan Ranald Bard, on 3 April 1746, the Royal Navy ship &quot;Baltimore&quot; arrived, and demanded (under threat of force) to be given the meat from the best cattle on the Island; 4 days later, complaining that the meat was rotten, the sailors threw it away, and slaughtered 60 cattle themselves. The Bard goes on to say that 12 days later, the Royal Navy ship &quot;Commodore&quot; arrived, and after receiving warning (from one of the sailors) about the lecherous intentions of the sailors, the women of Canna fled into the countryside and caves, until they were certain that the ship had departed; one pregnant woman miscarried from spending so long in the cold, and died.

The Bard himself served as the laird&#x27;s representative in Canna (the bailie) between 1749 and 1751, at which point he published the first ever book of Scottish Gaelic poetry. He reports of his predecessor that Major General John Campbell, grandson of the former Earl of Argyll, arrived at Canna after returning from chasing Bonnie Prince Charlie; Campbell seized the Bailie of Canna, and took him prisoner to Kerrera, but returned with him to Canna, slaughtered 40 cows, then took him to London. In London, the Bailie was held prisoner, for having taken part in the rebellion, until the Indemnity Act was passed in 1747; for his troubles, Campbell was made a Lieutenant General.

=== Dispersion ===
At the end of the 18th century, kelp harvesting became a major industry on Canna, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars limiting foreign supplies of certain minerals. However, when the wars ended, foreign supplies became available again, and the kelp price duly collapsed, causing a recession; in 1821, several of the inhabitants of Canna chose to escape their poverty by emigrating to Canada. Most of the remaining inhabitants moved to Sanday.

The Clan Ranald leader was not exactly a spendthrift, meaning that the lack of income from his tenants drove him into debt; in 1827, he sold Canna to Donald MacNeil. Donald MacNeil and his son were no better at fixing the economic pressures, and when the crops failed in 1847, the son resorted to evicting the population of Keill (which had been the main settlement), and replacing them with sheep. in 1861, Canna House was built as the MacNeil home.

=== Later years ===
In 1881, the post-clearance population was recorded as 119 (62 of whom were on Sanday); that year, MacNeil sold the island to Robert Thom, a Glaswegian shipbuilder. Thom carried out a programme of investment, including an oak pier, a footbridge to Sanday, and a Presbyterian Church, St Columba&#x27;s (though the population remained mostly Roman Catholic). In 1889, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Canna therefore became part of the new county of Argyll. However, the Act established a boundary review, which decided, in 1891, to move Canna to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.

In 1938, Thom&#x27;s family sought a sympathetic buyer, selling Canna to John Lorne Campbell, who organised the island as a farm and nature reserve, while transforming Canna House into a private archive of Scottish Gaelic literature, history, and folklore. Campbell lived on Canna until his death in 1996, but donated the island to the National Trust in 1981. In the 1970s, local government reforms abolished the County of Inverness, and moved Canna into Highland.

Campbell&#x27;s American-born wife and fellow folksong collector Margaret Fay Shaw, remained at Canna House until her own death in 2004, at the age of 101. In the following year a cull against brown rats was ordered, for they had hitherto been allowed to expand to enormous numbers, and now threatened rare Manx shearwaters and human health; Canna is now rat-free.

Some film footage that was recorded by Margaret Fay Shaw in the 1930s and 1940s became part of &quot;Solas&quot;, a film by Canna House archivist, Fiona J Mackenzie, based on Shaw&#x27;s life. It was first exhibited in spring 2019.

==== Stamps ====
A single local stamp was issued for Canna in 1958 by then-laird John Lorne Campbell. The stamp shows Compass Hill and two Manx shearwaters, a seabird found in profusion on the island. Their use is optional and all proceeds from the sale – at the island farm and post office — go to the Shipwrecked Mariners Society.

=== Overview of population trends ===
There are population records going back to the 16th century, the earliest of which combine Canna and Sanday. Following the clearances, population numbers remained fairly stable at around 20 to 30 during the second half of the 20th century, but by the time of the 2001 census had dwindled to 6 (or including Sanday, 12). Since then new residents have settled on the island, bringing the 2009 population of Canna and Sanday to around 20 (see below).
In 2015, it was reported that the population of Canna and Sanday had fallen to 19.

== Transport ==
A large natural harbour is formed between Canna and Sanday. The pier on Canna and those of the other Small Isles, was rebuilt and enlarged in 2005. This is used by the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, MV &quot;Lochnevis&quot;, which links Canna, and the neighbouring Small Isles of Rùm, Eigg and Muck, to the mainland port of Mallaig ( hours away). &quot;Lochnevis&quot; is capable of carrying motor vehicles, although National Trust permission is required to land them. The harbour is sheltered. It is the only deep harbour in the Small Isles, and is very popular with west coast yachting traffic out of Oban and Arisaig.

== Recent developments ==

=== Invasive species ===

==== Rat problem ====
In September 2005, it was reported that the population of brown rats on the island had grown to 10,000 and was causing such problems to both the human population and the birdlife, particularly the rare Manx shearwaters, that a complete cull would take place. Because the mice on the island are believed to be a rare and distinct subspecies of woodmouse, a breeding population of mice was removed beforehand by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) so that the cull could use rodenticide. By the end of 2006 it was believed that Canna was rat-free and during that summer there was also an encouraging increase in the number of breeding puffins and razorbills; Manx shearwaters were nesting for the first time since 1997.

==== Rabbit overpopulation ====
Within four years of the eradication of rats, a rabbit overpopulation problem was reported. The pests caused damage to archaeological monuments, such as an Iron Age mound and stone remains from the Clearances, as well as the islanders&#x27; vegetable gardens. The island&#x27;s only restaurant started serving rabbit meat in pies and with cranberry and pistachio. By 2013 rabbit numbers were estimated to have risen to 16,000 and the following year a team of six men engaged in a three-month cull of them, using traps, dogs, ferrets and guns to kill 9,000 rabbits.

=== Call for families for Canna ===
In October 2006, the National Trust for Scotland decided to invite two families to rent properties on the island, in an effort to attract new skills and spirit to the island community. The invitation was mainly aimed at people with &quot;skills in building, plumbing and gardening&quot;. The call was global and over 400 responses were received, from places as varied as Germany, Sweden, India and Dubai. From these, Sheila Gunn and John Clare were chosen to move to Canna during summer 2007. They were joined in early 2008 by two more incomers, Neil and Deborah Baker, from Llannon in the Gwendraeth Valley in South Wales. As a gardener, Neil Baker&#x27;s job was to restore the fine but overgrown gardens of Canna House. Since then, a further cottage was restored and was expected to be occupied by newcomers in 2011. However, in June 2011 it was announced that 12 people were planning to leave the island: Clare and Gunn, the Bakers and their two children, and schoolteacher Eilidh Soe-Paing, her husband and four children. The school would close, temporarily at least, as there would no longer be any school-age children on the island.

=== Gaelic Study Centre ===
The church, which is also owned by the National Trust for Scotland, was restored and converted into a hostel and study centre by the Hebridean Trust. This project was undertaken at the invitation of the owners. The centre is linked to the archive of Scottish Gaelic language, literature, and culture that was collected by literary scholar and former owner of Canna and Sanday, John Lorne Campbell. It was successfully completed and opened in 2001 by Princess Anne. Subsequently, there was water ingress, which caused damage to the interior. This challenge is in the hands of the National Trust for Scotland.

=== Crime ===
The island enjoys a near-zero crime rate, with only a handful of crimes recorded in the last several decades.

=== Restoration of Canna House ===
In May 2020, the National Trust US Foundation reported that major renovations were underway at Canna House and its gardens; the facility was originally expected to reopen in 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the restoration was delayed and it was unlikely to reopen until 2022.

The latter was the son of Charles Bragge and Anne Bathurst, granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Bathurst, younger brother of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst. In 1804, Charles Bathurst assumed the surname of Bathurst in lieu of Bragge.

<text>Viscount Brookeborough, of Colebrooke in the County of Fermanagh, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1952 for the Ulster Unionist politician and Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Captain The Rt. Hon. Sir Basil Brooke, 5th Bt., P.C. (N.I.), M.P.

==History==
The Brooke family descends from Sir Basil Brooke (born 1567), a captain in the English Army in Ireland and Governor of County Donegal in West Ulster, who was granted extensive lands in that county. His son, Sir Henry Brooke (died 1671), was granted the lands of and around &quot;Achadh Lon&quot; (renamed in English as Brookeborough) in County Fermanagh, also in West Ulster. He was Governor of County Donegal and a Member of the Irish Parliament for Brookeborough. His son, Thomas Brooke (died c. 1696), of Colebrooke, County Fermanagh, was a Member of the Irish Parliament and supporter of William III and Mary II. The estates were forfeited by James II.

Next in line, the son, Henry Brooke (1671–1761), represented Dundalk and County Fermanagh in the Irish Parliament. His younger son was Francis Brooke, of Colebrooke. His son, Henry Brooke, was created a baronet, of Colebrooke in the County of Fermanagh, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 7 January 1822. He was succeeded by his son, Arthur, the second Baronet. He was Conservative Member of Parliament for County Fermanagh at Westminster.

On his death in 1854, the title passed to his eldest son, Victor, the third Baronet. He served as a Deputy Lieutenant and was High Sheriff of County Fermanagh in 1867. His eldest son, Arthur, the fourth Baronet, was Sheriff of County Fermanagh in 1896 and a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for the county. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the aforementioned fifth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1952. His second but eldest surviving son, the second Viscount, was also a controversial politician. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the third Viscount, who succeeded in 1987. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher.

Numerous other members of the Brooke family have also gained distinction. Arthur Brooke, uncle of the first Baronet, was created a baronet in 1764 (see Brooke baronets). Sir Arthur Brooke (died 1843), brother of the first Baronet, was a lieutenant-general in the British Army. Richard Prittie Brooke (died 1836), younger brother of the first Baronet, was a major-general in the British Army. George Brooke, grandson of George Frederick Brooke, brother of the first Baronet, was created a baronet in 1903 (see Brooke baronets, of Summerton).

George Augustus Frederick Brooke, younger son of the first Baronet, was the father of 1) Arthur Thomas Brooke (died 1893), a captain in the Royal Navy, 2) Henry Francis Brooke (1836–1880), a brigadier-general in the British Army, 3) Lionel Godolphin Brooke (1849–1931), a brigadier-general in the Connaught Rangers, and 4) Frank Brooke (1851–1920), a businessman and public servant. The latter was the grandfather of Frank Hastings Brooke (1909–1982), a major-general in the Federation Army of Malaya, and Oliver George Brooke (born 1911), a brigadier in the Welch Regiment.

Sir Harry Vesey Brooke (1845–1921), younger son of the second Baronet, was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace. Arthur Basil Brooke (1847–1884), younger son of the second Baronet, was the father of Sir Basil Vernon Brooke (1876–1945), a rear admiral in the Royal Navy, and of Sir Bertram Norman Sergison-Brooke (1880–1967), a lieutenant-general in the British Army. The noted military strategist and commander Field Marshal The 1st Viscount Alanbrooke, sometime Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was the sixth son of the third Baronet (see the Viscount Alanbrooke for further history of this branch of the family).

The family seat is Colebrooke Park, near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.

A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he played in 42 Test matches and 20 One Day Internationals for the England cricket team, as well as playing for Middlesex County Cricket Club from 1986 to 2002. Tufnell took 121 Test match wickets. His Test average is 37.68 per wicket. Across all first-class cricket he took over 1,000 wickets at an average of 29.35. His cheerful personality and behaviour have made him a popular sports personality. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

Following his retirement from playing cricket in 2002, Tufnell has built on his popularity with several television appearances, including &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and winning &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2003.

==Early life==
Tufnell was educated at Highgate School where his cricketing prowess was recognised and he was appointed captain of the Junior School&#x27;s First XI before reaching the top year. On leaving Highgate, he attended and played cricket for Southgate School. He then trained in quantity surveying and was faced with the decision of whether to play cricket professionally or to work as a quantity surveyor. He chose to do the former.

==Cricket career==
As a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, Tufnell played 42 Test matches and 20 One Day Internationals for England between 1990 and 2001, and 316 first-class matches, mainly for Middlesex. 
Tufnell occasionally produced remarkable performances, for example taking 11–93 against Australia at the Oval in 1997 (for which he won the Man of the Match award after England won by 19 runs) and seven wickets in the match (6–25 in the first innings) against the West Indies at the Oval in 1991. He took his 121 Test wickets with a bowling average of 37.68 across his whole Test career. Mark Waugh theorised that &quot;if you attack him, he can go on the defensive, and it puts him off his game&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Waugh/Knight&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although Waugh was Tufnell&#x27;s most frequent Test victim, being dismissed a total of seven times by him, three of them bowled.

According to Michael Parkinson, a chat show host and cricketer, &quot;at the age of nine he was opening the bowling and the batting for his club&#x27;s junior team&quot;. Parkinson also believes that his &quot;ordinary fielding made him a luxury in the view of the ... [English cricket] management [circa August 1996]&quot;. He was not at all an accomplished or confident batsman, often appearing particularly nervous and awkward at Test level, where he became regarded as the ultimate &#x27;rabbit&#x27; number 11, Tufnell&#x27;s fielding improved during his career. He was nicknamed &quot;The Cat&quot; due to his propensity to be found sleeping in the corner of the dressing room. He also acquired the nickname &quot;Two Sugars&quot; due to his well-known love of tea. According to England teammate Mike Atherton, Tufnell smoked quite heavily.

During his career spanning 16 years with Middlesex, Tufnell took 1,057 first-class wickets in the English game at an average of 29.35.

Tufnell received an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University on 20 July 2011 in recognition of his achievements in sport and the media.

==Broadcasting career==

Get Me Out of Here!&quot; which he won. Prior to this, he had appeared on Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank. He was a team captain on sports quiz show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; until 2005.

On 4 October and 1 November 2008, Tufnell appeared on the game show &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;. In 2009, he competed in the seventh series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnering professional dancer Katya Virshilas. The couple were eliminated in the ninth week. On 7 October 2011, he appeared on the BBC One panel show &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;, where he claimed to have recurring dreams in which he is a potato, being chased by a pitchfork. On 19 November 2011, he appeared on a celebrity edition of ITV quiz show &quot;The Chase&quot;. 

In 2012, he co-presented &quot;The Flowerpot Gang&quot; with Anneka Rice and Joe Swift.

==Personal life==
Tufnell is married to Dawn Brown, having had two previous marriages. He has two daughters, one with former girlfriend Jane McElvoy and one with his second wife Lisa Bar. Tufnell&#x27;s personal life hit the headlines in 1994 when he was fined £800 after admitting assaulting McElvoy, after she ended their relationship.

In 1997, while on a tour of New Zealand, allegations emerged that he left a toilet cubicle of a restaurant trailing the scent of cannabis but he was exonerated with the incident being a publicity stunt.

Tufnell was the president of a cricket charity – The Change Foundation (formerly Cricket for Change) up to 2022. He is an ambassador of UK children&#x27;s charity The Children&#x27;s Trust for children with brain injury and neurodisability.

Tufnell is a fan of Arsenal Football Club.

<doc id="472084" wikidata="Q691882" url="?curid=472084" title="Münster rebellion">
<text>The Münster rebellion (, &quot;Anabaptist dominion of Münster&quot;) was an attempt by radical Anabaptists to establish a communal sectarian government in the German city of Münster then under the large Prince-Bishopric of Münster in the Holy Roman Empire.

The city was under Anabaptist rule from February 1534, when the city hall was seized and Bernhard Knipperdolling installed as mayor, until its fall in June 1535. It was Melchior Hoffman, who initiated adult baptism in Strasbourg in 1530, and his line of eschatological Anabaptism, that helped lay the foundations for the events of 1534–35 in Münster.

==Rebellion==

After the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–1525), a forceful attempt to establish theocracy was made at Münster, in Westphalia (1532–1535). Here the Anabaptists had gained considerable influence, through the adhesion of Bernhard Rothmann, the Lutheran pastor, and several prominent citizens and leaders, including Jan Matthys (also spelled Matthijs, Mathijsz, Matthyssen, Mathyszoon), a baker from Haarlem, and Jan Bockelson (or Beukelszoon), a tailor from Leiden. Bernhard Rothmann was a tireless and vitriolic opponent of Catholicism and a writer of pamphlets that were published by his ally, the wealthy wool merchant Bernhard Knipperdolling. The pamphlets at first denounced Catholicism from a radical Lutheran perspective, but soon started to proclaim that the Bible called for the absolute equality of man in all matters, including the distribution of wealth. The pamphlets, which were distributed throughout northern Germany, called upon the poor of the region to join the citizens of Münster to share the wealth of the town and benefit spiritually from being the elect of Heaven.

With so many Anabaptist adherents in the town, Rothmann and his allies had little difficulty obtaining possession of it at the elections for the magistracy and placing Bernhard Knipperdolling as the mayor, after deposing the mainly Lutheran magistrates, who, until then, had seen him as an ally in their own distrust of, and dislike for, Catholics. Matthys was a follower of Melchior Hoffman, and after Hoffman&#x27;s imprisonment at Strasbourg Matthys obtained a considerable following in the Low Countries, including Bockelson, who became known as John of Leiden. John of Leiden and Gerrit Boekbinder had visited Münster, and returned with a report that Bernhard Rothmann was in Münster teaching doctrines similar to their own. Matthys identified Münster as the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, and on January 5, 1534, a number of his disciples entered the city and introduced adult baptism. Rothmann apparently accepted &quot;baptism&quot; that day, and well over 1000 adults were soon baptised. Vigorous preparations were made not only to hold what had been gained but to spread their beliefs to other areas. The many Lutherans who left were outnumbered by the arriving Anabaptists. There was an orgy of iconoclasm in cathedrals and monasteries, and rebaptism became compulsory. The property of emigrants was shared out with the poor, and soon a proclamation was issued that all property was to be held in common.

==Siege==
The city was besieged by Franz von Waldeck, its expelled bishop. In April 1534, on Easter Sunday, Matthys, who had prophesied God&#x27;s judgment to come on the wicked on that day, led a procession from the city with twelve followers, as he believed himself the second Gideon. He and his followers were cut off and taken. Matthys was killed, his head placed on a pole for all in the city to see, and his genitals nailed to the city gate.

The 25-year-old John of Leiden was subsequently recognized as Matthys&#x27; religious and political successor, justifying his authority and actions by claiming visions from heaven. His authority grew until eventually he proclaimed himself the successor of David and adopted royal regalia, honors, and absolute power in the new &quot;Zion&quot;. There were now in the town at least three times as many women of marriageable age as men, so he made polygamy compulsory, and he himself took sixteen wives. (John is said to have beheaded Elisabeth Wandscherer in the marketplace for refusing to marry him, though this act might have been falsely attributed to him after his death.) Meanwhile, most of the residents of Münster were starving as a result of the year-long siege.

After lengthy resistance, the city was taken by the besiegers on June 24, 1535, and John of Leiden and several other prominent Anabaptist leaders were captured and imprisoned. In January 1536, John of Leiden, Bernhard Knipperdolling and one more prominent follower, Bernhard Krechting, were tortured and executed in the marketplace of Münster. Their bodies were exhibited in cages which hung from the steeple of St. Lambert&#x27;s Church. The bones were removed later, but the cages hang there still.

According to a contemporary source, about 3,000 people died during the siege. 

==Aftermath==
The Münster Rebellion was a turning point for the Anabaptist movement. It never again had the opportunity of assuming political importance, as both Catholic and Lutheran civil powers adopted stringent measures to counter this. It is difficult to trace the subsequent history of the group as a religious body, through changes in the names used and beliefs held.

The Batenburgers under Jan van Batenburg preserved the violent millennialist stream of Anabaptism seen at Münster. They were polygamous and believed force was justified against anyone not in their sect. Their movement went underground after the suppression of the Münster Rebellion, with members posing as Catholics or Lutherans as necessary. Some nonresistant Anabaptists found leaders in Menno Simons and the brothers Obbe and Dirk Philips, Dutch Anabaptist leaders who repudiated the distinctive doctrines of the Münster Anabaptists. This group eventually became known as the Mennonites after Simons. They rejected any use of violence and preached a faith based on compassion and love of enemy.

In August 1536, the leaders of Anabaptist groups influenced by Melchior Hoffman met in Bocholt in an attempt to maintain unity. The meeting included followers of Batenburg, survivors of Münster, David Joris and his sympathisers, and the nonresistant Anabaptists. At this meeting, the major areas of dispute between the sects were polygamous marriage and the use of force against non-believers. Joris proposed compromise by declaring the time had not yet come to fight against the authorities, and that it would be unwise to kill any non-Anabaptists. The gathered Anabaptists agreed to the compromise of no more force, but the meeting did not prevent the fragmentation of Anabaptism.

<text>In European folklore, mandragoras are familiar demons who appear in the figures of little men without beards.

Mandragoras are thought to be little dolls or figures given to sorcerers by the Devil for the purpose of being consulted by them in time of need, and it would seem as if this conception had sprung directly from that of the &quot;fetish&quot;, which is nothing else than a dwelling-place made by a shaman or medicine-man for the reception of any wandering spirit who chooses to take up his abode therein.

<text>Matilda is a 1988 children&#x27;s novel by British author Roald Dahl. It was published by Jonathan Cape. The story features Matilda Wormwood, a precocious child with an uncaring mother and father, and her time in a school run by the tyrannical headmistress Miss Trunchbull.

The book has been adapted in various media, including audio readings by actresses Joely Richardson, Miriam Margolyes and Kate Winslet; a 1996 feature film &quot;Matilda&quot; directed by Danny DeVito; a two-part BBC Radio 4 programme; and a 2010–2011 musical &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; which ran on the West End in London, Broadway in New York, and around the world. A film adaptation of the musical, &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;, was released in 2022.

In 2003, &quot;Matilda&quot; was listed at number 74 in &quot;The Big Read&quot;, a BBC survey of the British public of the top 200 novels of all time. In 2012, &quot;Matilda&quot; was ranked number 30 among all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a US monthly. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;Matilda&quot; in its list of the &quot;100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time&quot;. In 2012, Matilda Wormwood appeared on a Royal Mail commemorative postage stamp.

== Plot ==
In a small Buckinghamshire village forty minutes by bus away from Reading and 8 miles from Aylesbury, Matilda Wormwood is born to Mr and Mrs Wormwood. She immediately shows awesome , learning to speak at age one and to read at age three and a half, perusing all the children&#x27;s books in the library by the age of four and three months and moving on to longer classics such as &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Her parents however emotionally abuse her and completely refuse to acknowledge her abilities; to keep from getting frustrated, Matilda finds herself forced to pull pranks on them, such as gluing her father&#x27;s hat to his head, sticking a parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar or ghost, and bleaching her father&#x27;s hair with peroxide.

At the age of five and a half, Matilda enters school and befriends her polite and compassionate teacher Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by her intellectual abilities. Miss Honey tries to move Matilda into a higher class, but the tyrannical headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, refuses. Miss Honey also tries to talk to Mr and Mrs Wormwood about their daughter&#x27;s intelligence, but they ignore her, with the mother contending &quot;brainy-ness&quot; is an undesirable trait in a little girl.

Miss Trunchbull later confronts a girl called Amanda Thripp for wearing pigtails (the headmistress repeatedly displays a dislike of long hair throughout the book) and does a hammer throw with the girl over the playground fence. A boy called Bruce Bogtrotter is later caught by the cook stealing a piece of Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s cake; the headmistress makes him attempt to eat an wide cake in front of the assembly, then smashes the platter over his head in rage after he unexpectedly succeeds.

Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey and watches as Trunchbull terrorises her students with deliberately creative, over-the-top punishments to prevent parents from believing them, such as throwing them in a dark closet dubbed &quot;The Chokey&quot;, which is lined with nails and broken glass. When Matilda&#x27;s friend Lavender plays a practical joke on Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of water, Matilda is blamed; in anger, she uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass of water containing the newt onto Trunchbull. 

Matilda reveals her new powers to Miss Honey, who confides that after her wealthy father, Dr Magnus Honey, suspiciously died, she was raised by an abusive aunt, revealed to be Miss Trunchbull, who evidently murdered Magnus while making it look like a suicide. And besides committing other misdeeds, Miss Trunchbull appears to be withholding her niece&#x27;s inheritance; Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage, and her salary is being paid into Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s bank account for the first 10 years of her teaching career while she is restricted to £1 per week in pocket money. Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda practices her telekinesis at home. Later, during a sadistic lesson that Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of chalk to the blackboard and begins to use it to write, posing as the spirit of Magnus Honey. Addressing Miss Trunchbull using her first name (Agatha), &quot;Magnus&quot; demands that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey&#x27;s house and wages and leave the school, causing Miss Trunchbull to faint.

The next day, the school&#x27;s deputy headmaster, Mr Trilby, visits Trunchbull&#x27;s house and finds it empty, except for signs of Trunchbull&#x27;s hasty exit. She is never seen again, and the next day Miss Honey receives a letter from a local solicitor&#x27;s office, telling her that her father&#x27;s lifetime savings were safe in her bank and the property she lived in as a child was left to her. Trilby becomes the new headmaster, proving himself to be capable and good-natured, overwhelmingly improving the school&#x27;s atmosphere and curriculum, and quickly moving Matilda into the top-form class with the 11-year-olds. Rather to Matilda&#x27;s relief, she soon is no longer capable of telekinesis. Miss Honey theorises this is because Matilda is using her brainpower on a more challenging curriculum, leaving less of her brain&#x27;s enormous energy free.

Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, returning home one day to find her parents and her older brother Michael hastily packing to leave for Spain. Miss Honey explains this is because the police found out Mr Wormwood has been selling cars with tampered speedometers and sawdust. Matilda asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather distractedly agree. Matilda and Miss Honey find their happy ending, as the Wormwoods drive away, never to be seen again.

==Writing the novel==
Dahl&#x27;s initial draft for the novel portrayed Matilda as a wicked, irrational girl, her name being drawn from Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s poem &quot;Matilda Who Told Such Dreadful Lies&quot;, who tortured her innocent parents and used her psychokinetic powers to help an unethical teacher win money at horse racing. Dahl&#x27;s biographer Jeremy Treglown went through the author&#x27;s documents, including the drafts for the novel, and noted that the American editor Stephen Roxburgh at Farrar, Straus and Giroux had been instrumental in reshaping the story. It was Roxburgh&#x27;s idea to make Matilda an innocent child who loved books, with her powers manifesting as a result of abuse she endured. Roxburgh also suggested various changes to the main characters that were incorporated into the finished novel. As Dahl decided to take the manuscript to a different publishers, the two had a falling out. The edited version of the manuscript was published by Puffin Books. Dahl explained in an interview that he &quot;got it wrong&quot; at first and that the book took over a year to rewrite, though he failed to mention Roxburgh&#x27;s input.

==Reception==
The year after the book was published, it received the 1989 Red House Children&#x27;s Book Award. In 2000, it received the Blue Peter Book Award. In 2003, &quot;Matilda&quot; was listed at number 74 in &quot;The Big Read&quot;, a BBC poll of the British public of the top 200 novels of all time. In 2012 &quot;Matilda&quot; was ranked number 30 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily US audience. It was the first of four books by Dahl among the Top 100, more than any other writer. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Matilda&quot; in its list of the &quot;100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time&quot;. Worldwide sales have reached 17 million, and since 2016 sales have spiked to the extent that it outsells Dahl&#x27;s other works. In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 10 in their poll of &quot;The 100 greatest children&#x27;s books of all time&quot;.

== Dahl&#x27;s inspiration ==
The &quot;mean and loathsome&quot; Mrs Pratchett, owner of the sweet shop Dahl frequented as a boy in Cardiff, inspired Dahl&#x27;s creation of Miss Trunchbull. Mr Wormwood was based on a real-life character from Dahl&#x27;s home village of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire. The library in Great Missenden was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps&#x27;s library, where Matilda devours classic literature by the age of four and three months. On Matilda&#x27;s love of reading books, Lucy Dahl stated that her father&#x27;s novel was, in part, about his love for books: &quot;I think that there was a deep genuine fear within his heart that books were going to go away and he wanted to write about it&quot;.

==Adaptations==

In 1990, the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham produced a musical version, adapted by Rony Robinson with music by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, which toured the UK. It starred Annabelle Lanyon as Matilda and Jonathan Linsley as Miss Trunchbull and had mixed reviews. A second musical version of the novel, &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;, written by Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin and commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, premiered in November 2010. It opened at the Cambridge Theatre in the West End on 24 November 2011. It opened on Broadway on 11 April 2013 at the Shubert Theatre. The musical has since done a US tour and opened in July 2015 in Australia. The stage version has become hugely popular with audiences and praised by critics, and won multiple Olivier Awards in the UK and Tony Awards in the US. One critic called it &quot;the best British musical since &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;&quot;.

The novel was made into the film &quot;Matilda&quot; in 1996. It starred Mara Wilson as Matilda, and was directed by Danny DeVito, who also portrayed Mr Wormwood and narrated the story. The film changed the setting and nationality of every character (except Trunchbull who is played by Welsh actress Pam Ferris) from British to American. Although not a commercial success, it received critical acclaim at the time of its release, and on Rotten Tomatoes has a score of 90% based on reviews from 21 critics.

In December 2009, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot; broadcast a two-part adaptation by Charlotte Jones of the novel with Lenny Henry as the Narrator, Lauren Mote as Matilda, Nichola McAuliffe as Miss Trunchbull, Emerald O&#x27;Hanrahan as Miss Honey, Claire Rushbrook as Mrs Wormwood and John Biggins as Mr Wormwood.

The book has been recorded as an audiobook by at least ten different narrators since the 1980s. In 1998, Miriam Margolyes narrated an abridged recording for Penguin Random House ( on cassette in 1998 and republished as on CD in 2004). In 2004, Joely Richardson narrated the unabridged audiobook for Harper Childrens Audio (). In 2013, Kate Winslet narrated an unabridged recording for Listening Library ();&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/gobblefunk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;musicbrainz/Matilda/Winslet&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, the American Library Association shortlisted her for an Odyssey Award for her performance.

In 2018, Netflix was revealed to be adapting &quot;Matilda&quot; as an animated series, as part of an &quot;animated event series&quot; along with other Roald Dahl books such as &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;The Twits&quot;, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. A film adaptation of the musical was released by Sony Pictures Releasing and Netflix in 2022. It stars Alisha Weir as Matilda and Emma Thompson as Miss Trunchbull. It is directed by Matthew Warchus.

===The novel at 30===
Celebrating 30 years of the book&#x27;s publication in October 2018, original illustrator Quentin Blake imagined what Matilda might be doing as a grown-up woman today. He drew images of her undertaking three possible roles: an explorer, an astrophysicist, and a librarian at the British Library.

===2023 censorship controversy===

Despite Roald Dahl having enjoined his publishers not to &quot;so much as change a single comma in one of my books&quot;, in February 2023 Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Books, announced it would be re-writing portions of many of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels, changing the language to, in the publisher&#x27;s words, &quot;ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today&quot;. The decision was met with sharp criticism from groups and public figures including authors Salman Rushdie, Christopher Paolini, British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Queen Camilla, Kemi Badenoch, PEN America, and Brian Cox. Dahl&#x27;s publishers in the United States, France, and the Netherlands declined to incorporate the changes. Following the backlash, on 23 February, Puffin announced it would release an unedited selection of Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s books as &quot;The Roald Dahl Classic Collection&quot; because of &quot;the importance of keeping Dahl&#x27;s classic texts in print&quot;.

In &quot;Matilda&quot;, more than sixty changes were made, including replacing references to Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad with Jane Austen and John Steinbeck, removing references to skin colour (such as &quot;turning white&quot;, &quot;beginning to go dark red&quot;, &quot;red in the face&quot;, and &quot;white as paper&quot;), removing or changing the words &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;mad&quot;, and &quot;crazy&quot; (such as changing &quot;wobbling crazily&quot; to &quot;wobbling unsteadily&quot;), removing the word &quot;madonna&quot;, and changing &quot;heroine&quot; to &quot;hero&quot;.

==Connections to other Roald Dahl books==
One of Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s punishments is to force an overweight child, Bruce Bogtrotter, to eat an enormous chocolate cake, which makes him so full that he cannot move. The cook had caught him stealing a piece of cake from the kitchen. In &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Revolting Recipes&quot; one of the recipes is based on that cake. Bruce is a more sympathetic variation of Augustus Gloop (from &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;) and similar gluttons, and he is praised for finishing the cake without suffering nausea. The short story &quot;The Magic Finger&quot; by Roald Dahl, released in 1966, may have been a precursor to &quot;Matilda&quot;. A young girl has power within her finger to do things to other people when she gets emotional about a cause she feels strongly about.

==Continuation stories==
In 2024 a collection of short stories by new writers titled &quot;Charlie and the Christmas Factory&quot; was published by Puffin including a continuation story on Matilda by Elle McNicoll.

<doc id="472090" wikidata="Q501215" url="?curid=472090" title="Muck, Scotland">
<text>Muck (; ) is the smallest of four main islands in the Small Isles, part of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Today, much of the island is used for grazing. Residents use wool to make rugs and clothing. There are several ancient monuments and some facilities for visitors. The few residents are served by a single school, Muck Primary School &amp; Nursery. The island is owned by the MacEwen family.

==Geology==
The larger part of the island is formed from olivine-phyric basalt flows erupted during the Palaeocene. Flows of hawaiite can also be found around the south coast. Together these form the Eigg Lava Formation, a greater part of which is exposed on Eigg itself. The lava flows are cut through by a swarm of Palaeocene age basalt and dolerite dykes generally aligned NNW-SSE. A handful of faults are mapped on a similar alignment, the most significant one of which stretches SE from Bagh a Ghallanaichy of Laig. Gabbro is exposed along the eastern side of the bay of Camas Mor whilst on its western side are a suite of sedimentary rocks including small exposures of the Valtos Sandstone, Duntulm and Kilmaluag formations representing the upper part of the middle Jurassic Great Estuarine Group which is more extensively exposed on nearby Eigg.

There are some peat and till deposits on the island, albeit restricted in extent.

==Geography==

Muck is adjacent to the other Small Isles (Canna, Rùm and Eigg). It measures roughly east to west. The island&#x27;s tallest hill is Beinn Airein ().

The island&#x27;s population was 27 as recorded by the 2011 census four fewer than the 31 usual residents in 2001; during the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The populace mostly live near the harbour at Port Mòr. The other settlement on the island is the farm at Gallanach. The island&#x27;s only road, about long, connects the two.

Muck is also known for its seal population, and for the porpoises in the surrounding waters.

==Facilities==

A causeway and slipway were built at Port Mòr in 2005. This allows vehicles to be driven on and off the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , which links Muck and the neighbouring Small Isles with the mainland port of Mallaig (2½ hours away). However, visitors are not normally permitted to bring vehicles to the Small Isles. During the summer months the islands are also served by Arisaig Marine&#x27;s ferry MV &quot;Sheerwater&quot; from Arisaig, south of Mallaig. It is featured in the on-line newspaper &quot;West Word&quot;.

The island has no church, shop or post office, and, uniquely among Scottish islands with a population of this size, it has no post box. Until 1970 it had no electricity supply; this was initially provided by means of diesel generators, but in 1999 two large wind turbines were built. There is a hotel, Gallanach Lodge, and a range of other holiday accommodation.

== Etymology ==
The English name of the island derives from the Gaelic word &quot;muc&quot; which James Boswell in 1785 took this to mean that the name of the island meant &quot;Sow&#x27;s Island&quot;. It is now thought to refer to the high number of porpoises around it, loosely called &quot;muc-mhara&quot; &#x27;sea-pig&#x27; (cf &quot;mereswine&quot;). The laird in Boswell&#x27;s era disliked the name, especially as it meant him being referred to as &quot;Muck&quot;, and thus had attempted to persuade Samuel Johnson and Boswell that the authentic name was &quot;Isle of Monk&quot;.

==History==

=== Early history ===
A thumbnail scraper found at Toaluinn on Muck indicates possible occupation in the Neolithic Era. This appears to have continued into the Bronze Age, if a dagger found on Muck, and dating between 800 and 400 BC, is anything to go by. A number of cairns, of ambiguous date, are scattered around Port Mòr, and elsewhere on the island. At some point in the Iron Age, a natural stack – &quot;Caistel nan Duin Bhan&quot; – in a commanding position near Port Mòr, was fortified by construction of a thick wall around the summit; it remained in use until medieval times.
According to local traditions, after Columba, a 6th-century Irishman, established a campaign (based at Iona) to Christianise the region, he himself visited Muck. A field adjacent to the ancient graveyard in Kiel was historically named &quot;Dail Chill Fionain&quot; (&quot;the field of Finnian&#x27;s Church&quot;), in reference to Columba&#x27;s tutor; the undated remains of an ancient chapel lie within the graveyard, which also contained two inscribed slabs which seem to date from this period. The name of &quot;Glen Martin&quot; is likewise traditionally ascribed to a hermit who supposedly lived there at this time.

=== Kingdom of the Isles ===
In the 9th century, Vikings invaded the Small Isles, along with the rest of the Hebrides, and the gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the south, establishing the Kingdom of the Isles throughout these lands. For a long time, the only known evidence of Viking presence in Muck were Norse-based placenames such as &quot;Godag&quot; and &quot;Lamhraig&quot;, but more recently, limited remains were found in Northern Muck of a building which could date to this era. Following Norwegian unification, the Kingdom of the Isles became a crown dependency of the Norwegian king; to the Norwegians it was &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;). Malcolm III of Scotland acknowledged in writing that Suðreyjar was not Scottish, and king Edgar quitclaimed any residual doubts. However, in the mid 12th century, Somerled, a Norse-Gael of uncertain origin, launched a coup, which made Suðreyjar entirely independent.

Following his death, Norwegian authority was nominally restored, but in practice the kingdom was divided between Somerled&#x27;s heirs; the MacRory, a branch of Somerled&#x27;s descendants, ruled a region stretching from Uist to the Rough Bounds, and including the Small Isles. In 1209, the MacRory donated Muck to the (Norwegian) Bishop of the Isles.

=== Bishop of the Isles ===

Little is recorded of how the Bishop dealt with Muck, but in 1266, by the Treaty of Perth, the Scottish king purchased the whole of Suðreyjar. At the turn of the century, William I had created the position of Sheriff of Inverness, to be responsible for the Scottish highlands, which theoretically now extended to Muck; nevertheless, the Treaty explicitly preserved the status of the various divisions of Suðreyjar as crown dependencies, leaving the Bishop effectively sovereign. Awkwardly, the Bishopric remained part of the Norwegian Archdiocese of Niðarós, until Shetland and Orkney also joined the Scottish king&#x27;s possessions, in 1472 (at which point the Bishopric became part of the new Archdiocese of St Andrews).
In 1549, conducting a survey, the &quot;Dean of the Isles&quot; (Donald Monro) wrote:
The Dean&#x27;s account is the first known written reference to Muck. He went on to describe the offshore islet of Eilean nan Each as &quot;&quot;in Englishe the Horse ile, guid for horse and uther store, perteining to the Bishope of the iles&quot;.&quot;. At this time, the Bishopric was based on Iona (called &quot;Icolmkill&quot; at this time – the &quot;Isle of Columba&#x27;s Church&quot;); many centuries later, Boswell reported being told by the inhabitants that the island had been &quot;churchland belonging to Icolmkill&quot;.

According to the Bishop&#x27;s rental accounts, of 1561, his tenants in Muck were the MacIans. The MacIans were the lairds of Ardnamurchan on the adjacent mainland, but no records have yet been found to indicate when or why they became tenants on Muck as well; Muck is the most fertile of the Small Isles, so the land would certainly have been desirable.

=== MacLeans and MacIans ===
The MacIans were a branch of the MacDonalds, with whom the MacLeans of Duart had a longstanding feud, concerning the Rhinns of Islay. In 1588, some of the remains of the Spanish Armada found refuge with the MacLeans, who demanded the Spanish supply 100 soldiers, in return for refuge; they having agreed, the Maclean leader took the opportunity to attack the Small Isles in relation to his feud with the MacDonalds. The MacIans fought them off, and the Spanish eventually departed from the region without even paying for the provisions given to them by the MacLeans.

The Scottish reformation was rapidly sweeping through the region at this time; the MacLeans, and even Dean Monro himself, became presbyterians. In 1617, Andrew Knox, a presbyterian who reluctantly held the post of &quot;Bishop&quot; of the Isles, sold Muck to Lachlan Maclean, the laird of Coll. Lachlan expelled the MacIans at once, then gave Muck to his younger son, Hector. Coll, along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart, was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, one of the most powerful Scottish political figures of the age, shrieval authority over Muck was transferred from Inverness to the latter sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl&#x27;s family.

In 1650, the MacIans lost control of Ardnamurchan as well, and decided to seek revenge on Hector for the way Lachlan had treated them. They landed on Muck at night, and started rustling away the cattle. Hector happened to be outside at the time, and shot at them; in turn, Gillespie MacIan Shaor, one of the MacIans present, shot back, killing Hector. By this point Hector had a son, and therefore founded the line of &quot;MacLeans of Muck&quot;. Their comital authority was extinguished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act, in 1746, but they retained considerable power as lairds.

=== Religion and disease ===
On Muck, the reformation had left the population balanced between presbyterians and Roman Catholics; in 1764, each amounted to nearly half the population. A few years later, however, the MacLeans Lairds began a campaign of religious persecution, demanding that all tenants renounce the Catholic Church in Scotland, or face eviction. In 1770, the MacLean laird&#x27;s wife even arrested up a Roman Catholic priest, who had just arrived to visit the Catholic population of Muck, telling him she was following &quot;Boisdale&#x27;s example&quot;; the priest was deported to the Scottish mainland as soon as a ship became available.

When Samuel Johnson and James Boswell visited the region in 1773, though they didn&#x27;t visit Muck in person, the laird was keen to ensure they were aware of his philanthropy, which Johnson subsequently reported in his book &quot;A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&quot;:
=== Prosperity and poverty ===
Johnson&#x27;s work also gives an insight into the prosperity on Muck:
Nevertheless, Lachlan, his nephew and eventual heir, fell into debt, as a result of being appointed Resident Governor of the Tower of London; in 1802 he therefore sold Muck to the leader of Clan Ranald.

Following the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, a decade after Johnson&#x27;s visit, the availability of certain minerals became restricted, causing the price for kelp to rocket. The Clan Ranald leader had no compunction in taking advantage of this, by deliberately halving tenancies in size – turning 24 plots into 47 – in order to stop them being self-sufficient; tenants would have to take on other work – such as kelp harvesting – to survive.

In 1813, shortly after the kelp price peaked, Muck was sold to Colonel Alexander MacLean, leader of the MacLeans of Coll, for the comparatively large price of £9,975. However, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, just a few years later, the kelp price collapsed, making rents impossible for the population of Muck to afford. With no way to get value from his purchase, Colonel MacLean fell into debt, and in 1826 decided to replace his tenants with sheep. Several had already emigrated to Canada, in 1822, and in 1828 the Colonel bade 100 more to join them. The remaining population built the village of Keil, by Port Mòr, and moved there. By 1835, however, most have moved to other areas of Scotland or emigrated.

=== Cows and fish ===
In the late 1830s, the island was leased to John Cameron, a famed cattle-drover, who replaced the sheep with cattle. In 1846, the lease was transferred to James Thorburn, who re-introduced sheep. Five years later, Muck was sold to Captain Swinburne, with the Thorburns keeping a lease of the farmland, under him. While the Thorburns built roads and installed a threshing machine, Swinburne was keen to invest in fishing, and built dykes (Scottish term for dry stone walls), and a pier at Port Mòr; when not working on the farm, the remaining islanders fished the Rockall area. The Thornburns introduced Cheviot sheep and were successful in this endeavour.

In 1878, a family from Ayrshire who were farming on the Isle of Coll – the Weirs – became the tenants of the farmland, transforming it into an arable establishment, and dairy farm, specialising in cheese. In 1889, administrative counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Muck therefore became part of the new county of Argyll. However, the Act established a boundary review, which decided, in 1891, to move Muck to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.

In 1896 Muck was sold to Robert Lawrie Thomson, who owned Eigg and Strathaird Estate on Skye. Thomson died in 1913, and Muck was left to his older brother, John MacEwen. When John died in 1916, he left Muck to his nephew, Lieutenant William Ivan Lawrence MacEwen, who left the Royal Navy, and retrained at agricultural college, subsequently taking over the running of the farm in 1922. His descendants have owned the island ever since. In the early 1970s, the family built the hotel at Port Mòr. In the 21st century Muck is operated by a Trust set up by the MacEwen family.

==&quot;Prince of Muck&quot;==
On 18 May 2022, BBC Four broadcast the documentary &quot;Prince of Muck&quot; about Lawrence MacEwen, laird of the island. The documentary had previously had a showing on BBC Scotland in April, with the programme getting a national broadcast slot on BBC Four just two days after MacEwen died, aged 81, on 16 May 2022. &quot;Prince of Muck&quot;
received a 5 star review in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; with reviewer Benji Wilson saying the documentary by director Cindy Jansen was a &quot;film of elegiac brilliance&quot;.

<text>Ovidiu (, historical name: &quot;Canara&quot;, ) is a town situated a few kilometres north of Constanța in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania. Ovidiu is quite small, with a population of 13,968 as of 2021, and many wealthy inhabitants of Constanța retire there. It officially became a town in 1989, as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program.

In 1930, the town was renamed &quot;Ovidiu&quot; after the Roman poet Ovid (). He was supposedly buried on a nearby small island (also called &quot;Ovidiu&quot;) in the Siutghiol Lake.

==Administration==
The town of Ovidiu administers the villages of Poiana (historical names: &quot;Cocoșul&quot; - until 1964, - until 1926) and Culmea. The latter was established in 2011 by legally separating from Ovidiu two territorially distinct communities, Social Group Culmea and Social Group Nazarcea.

==Sport==
The stadium of FCV Farul Constanța is located in Ovidiu.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census Ovidiu had a population of 13,968 with a majority of Romanians (72.07%) and minorities of Tatars (2.14%), Roma (1.25%), Turks (1.15%), Lipovans (0.07%), Hungarians (0.05%), Bulgarians (0.03%), others (0.13%) and unknown (23.11%). 

At the 2011 census Ovidiu had a population of 13,847 with a majority of Romanians (81.01%) and minorities of Tatars (3.02%), Turks (2.51%), Roma (1.83%), Lipovans (0.06%), Greeks (0.04%), Germans (0.03%), others (0.13%) and unknown (11.37%).

<text>The Positronic Man is a 1992 novel by American writers Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg, based on Asimov&#x27;s 1976 novelette &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot;.

It is about a robot that begins to display characteristics, such as creativity, traditionally the province of humans; the robot is ultimately declared an official human being.

The 1999 film &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, starring Robin Williams, was based both on the original story and the novel.

==Plot summary==

In the twenty-first century the creation of the positronic brain leads to the development of robot laborers and revolutionizes life on Earth. Yet to the Martin family, their household robot NDR-113 is more than a mechanical servant. &quot;Andrew&quot; has become a trusted friend, a confidant, and a member of the Martin family.

The story is told from the perspective of Andrew (later known as Andrew Martin), an NDR-series robot owned by the Martin family, a departure from the usual practice by U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men of leasing robots.

Andrew&#x27;s initial experiences with the Martin family are replete with awkward moments which demonstrate his lack of socialization. However, he is much better with inanimate objects and animals and begins to display sentient characteristics (such as creativity; emotion; self-awareness) traditionally the province of humans. He is taken off his mundane household duties, for which he was intended, and allowed to pursue his creativity, making a fortune by selling his creations.

Andrew seeks legal protection stemming from his initial creative output and eventual full recognition as a human, by gradually replacing his robotic components with synthetic organs, and citing the process as a transformation from robot to human. Succeeding generations of the Martin family assist him in his quest for humanity, but each is limited to what degree they are prepared to acknowledge Andrew&#x27;s humanity.

In &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;, the trends of fictional robotics in Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series (as outlined in the book &quot;I, Robot&quot;) are detailed as background events, with an indication that they are influenced by Andrew&#x27;s story. No more robots in Andrew&#x27;s line are developed. There is also a movement towards centralized processing, including centralized control of robots, which would avoid any more self-reflecting robots such as Andrew.

Only when Andrew allows his positronic brain to &quot;decay&quot;, thereby willfully abandoning his immortality, is he declared a human being. This event takes place on the two-hundredth anniversary of his creation, hence the title of the novella and film.

==Foundation universe==
This story is set within Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; universe, which also includes his earlier Susan Calvin positronic robot tales. It is clearly set centuries prior to the events of his novelette &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and the novel &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, during a period in which the Spacer worlds have yet to turn against the people of the Earth, and in which the U.S. Robots corporation is still active.

== Adaptations ==

* &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999), film directed by Chris Columbus, based on novelette &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; and on novel &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;

<text>ESAB, &quot;Elektriska Svetsnings-Aktiebolaget&quot; (), is an American-Swedish industrial company.

The ultimate parent company of ESAB is ESAB Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange listed (Ticker: ESAB) with its principal executive office in North Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. 

ESAB products includes a fabrication technology arm, which includes welding, cutting, gas control, PPE, software, and robotic equipment and a separate gas control portfolio focused on healthcare, industrial, and specialty gas control solutions. 

==History==
The company was founded in 1904 by Swedish businessman Oscar Kjellberg in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company sells equipment for welding and cutting.

Other notable CEO was Lars Westerberg who ran ESAB for three years.

The ESAB was acquired by Charter International in 1994.

The ESAB group was acquired by Colfax Corporation on 13 January 2012.

Following the purchase, the CEO of Colfax, Clay Kiefaber, stepped down to the president role of ESAB and was replaced by Steve Simms.

The ESAB group acquired the Welding Wire business of Sandvik effective February 1, 2018. The acquisition included production units in Scranton, PA, and Sandviken, Sweden; the technical sales and product management organization; as well as multiyear strategic collaboration on R&amp;D for future product developments.

On April 5, 2022, Colfax Corp. (now Enovis Corp.) distributed 100% of the shares of ESAB Corporation to Colfax shareholders. The spin-off transaction was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission through a Form 10-12B registration statement. An Information Statement was sent to Colfax shareholders. 

On October 17, 2022, ESAB Corporation announced the acquisition of Ohio Medical, a global leader in oxygen regulators and central gas systems for the healthcare industry.

== Critics ==
In January 2024 ESAB was added to Ukraine&#x27;s list of International Sponsors of War for continuing to operate and expand business in Russia.

<doc id="472105" wikidata="Q6489130" url="?curid=472105" title="Large-file support">
<text>Large-file support (LFS) is the term frequently applied to the ability to create files larger than either 2 or 4 GiB on 32-bit filesystems.

==Details==
Traditionally, many operating systems and their underlying file system implementations used 32-bit integers to represent file sizes and positions. Consequently, no file could be larger than 232 − 1 bytes (4 GiB − 1). In many implementations, the problem was exacerbated by treating the sizes as signed numbers, which further lowered the limit to 231 − 1 bytes (2 GiB − 1). Files that were too large for 32-bit operating systems to handle came to be known as &quot;large files&quot;.

While the limit was quite acceptable at a time when hard disks were smaller, the general increase in storage capacity combined with increased server and desktop file usage, especially for database and multimedia files, led to intense pressure for OS vendors to overcome the limitation.

In 1996, multiple vendors responded by forming an industry initiative known as the Large File Summit to support large files on POSIX (at the time Windows NT already supported large files on NTFS), an obvious backronym of &quot;LFS&quot;. The summit was tasked to define a standardized way to switch to 64-bit numbers to represent file sizes.

This switch caused deployment issues and required design modifications, the consequences of which can still be seen:
* The change to 64-bit file sizes frequently required incompatible changes to file system layout, which meant that large-file support sometimes necessitated a file system change. For example, the FAT32 file system does not support files larger than 4 GiB−1 (with older applications even only 2 GiB−1); the variant FAT32+ does support larger files (up to 256 GiB−1), but (so far) is only supported in some versions of DR-DOS, so users of Microsoft Windows have to use NTFS or exFAT instead.
* To support binary compatibility with old applications, operating system interfaces had to retain their use of 32-bit file sizes and new interfaces had to be designed specifically for large-file support.
* To support writing portable code that makes use of LFS where possible, C standard library authors devised mechanisms that, depending on preprocessor constants, transparently redefined the functions to the 64-bit large-file aware ones.
* Many old interfaces, especially C-based ones, explicitly specified argument types in a way that did not allow straightforward or transparent transition to 64-bit types. For example, the C functions codice_1 and codice_2 operate on file positions of type codice_3, which is typically 32 bits wide on 32-bit platforms, and cannot be made larger without sacrificing backward compatibility. (This was resolved by introducing new functions codice_4 and codice_5 in POSIX. On Windows machines, under Visual C++, functions codice_6 and codice_7 are used.)

==Adoption==
The usage of the large-file API in 32-bit programs had been incomplete for a long time. An analysis did show in 2002 that many base libraries of operating systems were still shipped without large-file support thereby limiting applications using them. The much-used zlib library started to support 64-bit large-files on 32-bit platform not before 2006.

The problem disappeared slowly with PCs and workstations moving completely to 64-bit computing. Microsoft Windows Server 2008 has been the last server version to be shipped in 32-bit. Redhat Enterprise Linux 7 was published in 2014 only as a 64-bit operating system. Ubuntu Linux stopped delivering a 32-bit variant in 2019. Nvidia stopped to develop 32-bit drivers in 2018 and deliver updates after January 2019. Apple stopped developing 32-bit Mac OS versions in 2018 delivering macOS Mojave only as a 64-bit operating system. The end-of-life for Windows 10 has been set to 2025 on the desktop which is related to the latest upgrades from old systems like Windows 7 &amp; Windows 8 in January 2020 as some of those system ran on old computers built on the i386 architecture. Windows 11 however will ship only as a 64-bit operating system since its first version in 2021.

A similar development can be seen in the mobile area. Google required to support 64-bit versions of applications in their app store by August 2019, which allows to discontinue 32-bit support for Android later. The shift towards 64-bit started in 2014 when all new processors were designed to a 64-bit architecture and Android 5 (&quot;Lollipop&quot;) was published in that year providing a fitting 64-bit variant of the operating system. Apple had made shift in the year before starting to produce the 64-Bit Apple A7 by 2013. Google started to deliver the development environment for Linux only in 64-bit by 2015. In May 2019 the share of Android versions below 5 had fallen to ten percent. As app developers concentrate on a single compilation variant, many manufacturers started to require Android 5 as the minimum version by mid 2019, for example Niantic. Subsequently the 32-bit versions were hard to get.

Except for embedded systems with their special programs, the consideration of varying large-file support becomes obsolete in program code after 2020.

== Related problems ==
The year 2038 problem is well known for another case where a 32-bit &quot;long&quot; on 32-bit platforms will lead into problems. Just like the large-file limitation it will get obsolete when systems move to 64-bit only. In the meantime a 64-bit timestamp was introduced. In the Win32 API it is visible in functions having a &quot;64&quot; suffix along the earlier &quot;32&quot; suffix. When large-file support was added to the Win32 API it has led to functions having an additional &quot;i64&quot; suffix which sometimes makes for four combinations.(findfirst32, findfirst64, findfirst32i64, findfirst64i32). By comparison the UNIX98 API introduces functions with a &quot;64&quot; suffix when &quot;_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE&quot; is used.

Related to the large-file API there is a limitation of block numbers for mass storage media. With a common size of 512 bytes per data block the barrier resulting from 32-bit numbers did occur later. When hard disk drives reached a size of 2 terabyte (around 2010) the master boot record had to be replaced by the GUID Partition Table which uses 64-bit for the LBA numbers (logical block address). On Unix-like operating systems it did also require to enlarge the inode numbers which are used in some functions (stat64, setrlimit64). The Linux kernel introduced that in 2001 leading to version 2.4 which was picked up by the glibc in that year. As the large-file support and large-disk support was introduced at the same time the GNU C Library exports 64-bit inode structures on 32-bit architectures at the same time when the Unix LFS API is activated in program code.

When the kernel moved to 64-bit inodes the file system ext3 used them internally in the driver by 2001. However the inode format on the storage media itself was stuck at 32-bit numbers. As mass storage devices moved to the Advanced Format of 4 kilobyte per block the actual limit of that file system format is at 8 or 16 terabyte. Handling larger disk partitions requires the usage of a different file system like XFS which was designed with 64-bit inodes from the start allowing for exabyte files and partitions. The first 16 terabyte magnetic disk drives were delivered by mid 2019. Solid-state drive with 32 TiB for data centers were available as early as 2016 with some manufacturers forecasting 100 TiB SSD by 2020.

<doc id="472108" wikidata="Q679266" url="?curid=472108" title="Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March">
<text>Roger de Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March, 4th Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, KG (11 November 132826 February 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

He was the son of Sir Edmund Mortimer (d. 1331) and Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and grandson of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March.

== Inheritance ==
The Mortimer family lands and titles were lost after the first Earl of March&#x27;s revolt and death by hanging in 1330, which was followed the next year by the death of Roger&#x27;s father. Roger thus grew up with uncertain prospects, and re-acquired the family honours only gradually.

Around 1342, he received back Radnor, and the next year the old family baronial seat at Wigmore, Herefordshire.

== Military career ==
As a young man he distinguished himself in the wars in France, fighting at Crécy and elsewhere in the campaign of 1347. Afterwards, he was given livery of the rest of his lands, was one of the knights admitted at the foundation of the Order of the Garter, and was summoned to parliament as a baron both in 1348. 
He was knighted on 12 July 1346 at La Hogue by Edward the Black Prince.

== Earldom ==
In 1354, the sentence passed against Mortimer&#x27;s treacherous grandfather, the first earl, was reversed, and the next year he was summoned to parliament as Earl of March. Also in 1355, he received a number of important appointments, including Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and he accompanied an expedition of Edward III to France.

== Other honours ==
On 19 October 1356, his grandmother Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville, widow of the first earl, died, and Roger inherited her vast estates, including Ludlow Castle, which was thereafter the Mortimer family seat and power base.

In the following years, he became a member of the Royal Council and was appointed Constable at the castles of Montgomery, Bridgnorth in Shropshire, and Corfe in Dorset.

In 1359, and continuing into 1360, he was Constable of Edward III&#x27;s invasion of France. He fought in the failed siege of Reims and captured Auxerre. The English forces then moved into Burgundy, where Roger died suddenly at Rouvray, near Avallon.

== Marriage and children ==
Roger married Philippa de Montagu (1332–1381), daughter of William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and Catherine Grandison and had by her at least four children:
* Roger Mortimer, who died young;
* Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March;
* Margery Mortimer.
* Janet Mortimer, who married Andrew Gray, father of Andrew Gray, 1st Lord Gray.
Mortimer also had at least one illegitimate child:
* Sir Thomas Mortimer, who acted as deputy for his nephew Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, in Ireland (1382–1383) and stood trial for the slaying of Richard II&#x27;s commander, Sir Thomas Molineux after the Battle of Radcot Bridge (1387).

== Arms ==
Heraldic Coat of Arms: Barry Or and azure, on a chief of the first three pallets between two gyronnies based on the second, over all an inescutcheon argent.

<text>USS &quot;Tilefish&quot; (SS-307), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tilefish, a large, yellow-spotted deepwater food fish.

Her keel was laid down on 10 March 1943 at Vallejo, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 25 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Wilson D. Leggett, and commissioned on 28 December 1943.

==First and second war patrols==

During February and March 1944, &quot;Tilefish&quot; underwent trials and shakedown off the California coast before getting underway for Hawaii. On 3 April, the submarine departed Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol, setting course for the Japanese home islands. While patrolling in the &quot;Hit Parade&quot; area east of Honshū, &quot;Tilefish&quot; sighted many enemy aircraft but found few targets for her torpedoes. Early in the patrol, she was hampered by the failure of her fathometer; and, throughout the mission, she was plagued by periscope fogging and overcast weather which ruled out celestial navigation. Finally, on the morning of 11 May, the novice submarine and her crew encountered their first opportunity for action. &quot;Tilefish&quot; sighted a small convoy and launched a determined attack. Choosing a passenger liner as her target, the submarine unleashed a spread of torpedoes, scoring a hit under the ship&#x27;s bridge. As &quot;Tilefish&quot; dove amid the sounds of explosions, she experienced problems which caused her inadvertently to take on a large amount of water. Before the situation was brought under control, &quot;Tilefish&quot; had made a hair-raising dive to , well below test depth. Too deep to be reached by the depth charges of her pursuers, she evaded their attack and continued her patrol.

The son of a Tilefish crew member recalls from his childhood hearing a detailed account of this initial engagement:

&quot;My father, Motor Machinists Mate 2nd Class George Oberhofer, found himself in the thick of things during Tilefish’s first attack. At the time the target was sighted, repairs to the submarine’s ballast system were underway in her compressor compartment, with one disassembled pipe leaving the compartment in open communication with the sea. As a result, the compartment began to flood during the attack dive. Had the water level reached the electrical compressor motors, they would have shorted out, leaving her able to surface once but unable to dive again, a sitting duck for enemy destroyers.

&quot;MM2C Oberhofer dove into the flooding compartment to the offending pipe and managed to close it off and get the compartment pumped out before the compressor motors were damaged. For these actions he was awarded a silver star, rare in the submarine service where unit commendations for collective performance were the more typical way to recognize valor in combat.

&quot;My father kept a curious memento from the TIlefish, a tank watch in which the hands had become detached and floated freely around under the crystal. I asked what had happened to his watch and he replied, ‘Depth charges.’ This may shed light on events after the initial attack run. We may reasonably speculate that Tilefish was under heavy depth charging by Japanese destroyers after sinking her target, and was diving to extreme depths in search of a thermocline—a layer of water of a sharply different temperature than the water above it. Thermoclines reflect sonar pings, rendering a submarine that dives below one invisible. It seems likely that Tilefish successfully found one at 580 feet and slipped away because of it.&quot;

Finding further contact with the enemy to be very light, &quot;Tilefish&quot; requested another patrol area and was assigned to the northern Mariana Islands where she searched for targets on 19 and 20 May. She completed this patrol at Majuro on 29 May 1944.

After a refitting by submarine tender , &quot;Tilefish&quot; departed Majuro on 22 June 1944 and headed with an attack group for the Luzon Strait area. In company with submarines and , &quot;Tilefish&quot; set course, via Batan Island and Bashi Channel, for her assigned position. On the morning of 18 July, &quot;Tilefish&quot; launched a torpedo attack on a large convoy Hi-69 and had the satisfaction of seeing a freighter sustain two hits. Meanwhile, &quot;Rock&quot; had joined in the attack and was being held down by a destroyer of the convoy&#x27;s screen. At 10:50, &quot;Tilefish&quot; made a torpedo attack on the destroyer. Seeing their wakes, the enemy ship attempted to evade the torpedoes, but the first hit under its forward mount and wrapped her bow around the bridge. A second hit added to the destroyer&#x27;s damage. Before &quot;Tilefish&quot; was forced down by enemy aircraft, she caught one last glimpse of the destroyer, listing and dead in the water. Nine minutes later, the submarine made a periscope sweep and found no sign of the enemy ship. The enemy ship, frigate CD-17, survived her damage, however.

In the days that followed, the submarine patrolled the waters east of Formosa attempting to intercept the convoy which she had damaged on 18 July. On 26 July, &quot;Tilefish&quot; surfaced just at the moment when &quot;Sawfish&quot; launched a three-torpedo attack on Japanese submarine &quot;I-29&quot; (one of only six Axis powers submarines to attempt trans-oceanic Yanagi missions), which exploded, leaving behind only smoke and flames. On 31 July, after &quot;Sawfish&quot; had reported a convoy contact off Luzon, &quot;Tilefish&quot; set course to intercept the enemy ships but never found the quarry. &quot;Tilefish&quot; fueled at Midway Island before completing her second patrol at Pearl Harbor on 15 August.

==Third and fourth war patrols==

&quot;Tilefish&quot; departed Oahu on 10 September 1944. This patrol, conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands, was made difficult by rough seas which produced swells reaching heights of 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 m). Despite the problems imposed by high seas, &quot;Tilefish&quot; sank a small trawler with her four-inch (102 mm) gun on 23 September. On 3 October, she destroyed two small cargo vessels as they were leaving Hitokappu Bay of Iturup. On 6 October, &quot;Tilefish&quot; claimed two more kills—a cargo ship and a wooden-hulled antisubmarine vessel.During the mid-watch on 13 October, an adventurous owl came on board. The feathered seafarer was promptly dubbed Boris Hootski and made official ship&#x27;s mascot. On 16 October she sank the Japanese guard boat Kyowa Maru No.2 (108 GRT) On 17 October, to prevent its being salvaged, she blew out the stern of a vessel grounded west of Japan&#x27;s Shimushiru Island (today the Russian island Simushir). &quot;Tilefish&quot; ended her third patrol at Midway Island on 24 October 1944.

On 15 November, &quot;Tilefish&quot; got underway for the Kuril Islands. During the first half of this patrol, she operated in northern waters but was hampered by bitterly cold weather, poor visibility, and hurricane-force winds. The mountainous waves forced the submarine to submerge to ride out the storm. On 25 November, &quot;Tilefish&quot; entered the Sea of Okhotsk to patrol the coast of Shimushiru Island. Snow frosted the periscope and prevented accurate identification of possible targets. By 16 December, &quot;Tilefish&quot; had moved south to take up a lifeguard station off Najima Saki. On the morning of 22 December, she sank &quot;Chidori&quot;, a torpedo boat [758 tons], and evaded a Japanese counterattack of depth charges and aerial bombs without damage. She departed the patrol area on 24 December and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1945.

==Fifth and sixth war patrols==

After refitting by submarine tender , &quot;Tilefish&quot; set course for the Mariana Islands in company with submarines and on 31 January 1945, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Walter F. Schlech, Jr. En route, she participated in exercises and searched for the survivors of a downed American plane. Underway from Saipan on 13 February, &quot;Tilefish&quot; proceeded independently to her patrol area in the Nansei Shoto where she prowled the traffic lanes in search of targets. She reported sinking a 90-ton cargo ship (Sampan)[?]in a morning gun attack on 28 February before taking up a lifeguard station in support of planned strikes on Amami Shima. On 1 March, she rescued a flier from aircraft carrier whose plane had splashed and sank only 500 yards off the starboard bow of the submarine. On 4 March She sent a fishing trawler &quot;Shiko Maru&quot; to the bottom off Setsuko Saki, 28°15&#x27;N, 129°08&#x27;E. On the following day, in the course of a day-long attack on the 2812 ton freighter &quot;Hangzhou Maru&quot; (evaded attacks), she sank a Japanese minesweeper (W 15 500 tons)) which was escorting the cargo ship [W 15 was run aground but was a total loss].. From 10 March to 19 March, she performed lifeguard duties in support of strikes on Nagoya and other Japanese targets. After patrolling the approaches to Tokyo Bay on 22 March, &quot;Tilefish&quot; set course, via Midway Island and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco, California where she was overhauled.

&quot;Tilefish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 July and was soon underway for Midway Island and Saipan. When the war in the Pacific ended, &quot;Tilefish&quot; was on lifeguard station off the Ryukyu Islands. She continued lifeguard duties and patrols in the western Pacific until 7 September when she returned to Pearl Harbor. Early in 1946, &quot;Tilefish&quot; returned to San Francisco, California, and operated off the West Coast throughout most of the year. In May, she participated in &quot;wolfpack&quot; exercises and in September took part in live load training, using the hulk of the former SS &quot;Schuyler Colfax&quot; as a target. In October, she made a brief trip to the Hawaiian Islands and then returned to the West Coast. From January 1947 to September 1950, &quot;Tilefish&quot; continued to operate out of California ports with occasional voyages to Pearl Harbor. During this period, she conducted underway training and took part in fleet exercises off the West Coast.

==Post World War II service==

On 5 September 1950, &quot;Tilefish&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Japan. From 28 September 1950 through 24 March 1951, the submarine operated out of Japanese ports conducting patrols in Korean waters in support of the United Nations campaign in Korea. She made reconnaissance patrols of La Perouse Strait to keep the Commander, Naval Forces Far East, informed of Soviet seaborne activity in that area. After this tour, the submarine resumed her routine of operations out of Hawaiian and West Coast ports until 1957. Highlights of this period were convoy attack exercises in Hawaiian waters and a goodwill visit to Acapulco, Mexico, early in June 1956.

Following a period of reduced status and overhaul, &quot;Tilefish&quot; again got underway in April 1957 for Far Eastern waters. During this deployment, she visited ports in Japan and the Ryukyu Islands before completing the cruise at San Diego, California, on 27 September 1957.

On 16 September 1958, the veteran submarine made way via Pearl Harbor for Midway Island and the Marshall Islands. With four civilian geophysicists on board from the Hydrographic Office, the submarine completed a submerged survey of Eniwetok, Wake, and Midway Island, operating at sea for nearly three months. She returned to San Diego, California, on 5 December 1958 for inactivation.

&quot;Tilefish&quot; was decommissioned on 12 October 1959, underwent overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, and was recommissioned on 30 January 1960. Her final decommissioning was in May 1960. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1960, and sold to the Venezuelan government.

==ARV &quot;Carite&quot; (S-11)==

The ex-&quot;Tilefish&quot;, now commissioned as ARV &quot;Carite&quot; (S-11), served in the &quot;Armada Venezolana&quot; (the Venezuelan Navy) for 16 years. In 1969 and 1970, she played the part of a German U-boat hiding in the Orinoco River during the filming of the movie &quot;Murphy&#x27;s War&quot;. For the role, she was modified by the addition of a &quot;cigarette deck&quot; aft of her sail and was painted in a &quot;dazzle&quot; camouflage pattern.

&quot;Carite&quot; was decommissioned by the Venezuelan Navy on 28 January 1977 and cannibalized for spare parts.

==Awards==

&quot;Tilefish&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service. She received one battle star for Korean War service.

<doc id="472115" wikidata="Q2738032" url="?curid=472115" title="The Last Blade">
<text>The Last Blade is a fighting game developed and released by SNK for the Neo Geo system in 1997. It was also ported to several home systems. A sequel, &quot;The Last Blade 2&quot;, was released in 1998. A second sequel, &quot;The Last Blade: Beyond the Destiny&quot;, was released in 2000.

The game takes place during the Bakumatsu era in Japan, and incorporates various elements of Japanese mythology (with a heavy emphasis on the symbology of the Four Symbols). As such, the background music generally incorporates synthesized instruments simulating a sound appropriate to the 19th century setting, in a Western classical, pseudo-Romantic style (unusual for a fighting game).

== Gameplay ==

The &quot;Last Blade&quot; series is seen as a spiritual offshoot to SNK&#x27;s popular &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series, due to it being a similar 2D weapons-based fighting game. It also took over several elements from cancelled Technōs/Face&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Heaven&quot; (which tentatively was named &quot;DarkSeed&quot;). The gameplay is characterised by two selectable fighting styles, and a unique combo system along with a &quot;deflect&quot; system which involves pressing the D button at an opponent&#x27;s attack. Upon deflecting, the opponent is left open to attack.

The two styles are Speed mode and Power mode. Speed mode allows players to chain several normal attacks into a special or desperation/super move, as well as execute a Speed Combo. Power mode on the other hand, grants the player increased damage potential exponentially and gives access to Super Desperation Moves, which inflict an exorbitant amount of damage (performing them however, requires the player&#x27;s life bar to flash and have a full power bar). Power mode also allows the player to perform Super Cancels; canceling a special move into a desperation/super move (but not a desperation move, with the sole exception of Awakened Kaede in the first game).

==Characters==
* is a 14-year-old girl in &quot;The Last Blade&quot;. Born and raised in Tokyo, she was constantly battling diseases on her own until she finally understood her true calling: teleportation. When her older sister Hikari succumbed to disease, Akari became very agitated. At that time, their father called for her. She restlessly sat before her grim-faced father, who was about to give her a lecture about Hell&#x27;s Gate. Akari found out that Hell&#x27;s Gate was causing trouble again, and flew out of the room, bent on finding the perfect cure for her sister&#x27;s disease on her own: sealing Hell&#x27;s Gate. Her father accused her of not listening to what he said, but she was already gone.
* is a legendary swordsman who once traveled the countryside, honing his skills and challenging worthy opponents along the way. During one of his battles he was killed by another swordsman. When Shinnosuke Kagami begins his plan to open Hell&#x27;s Gate and bring about a new world order, he resurrects Musashi to further his plans and kill innocent people. To both their chagrins, while on one of his travels, Musashi was defeated. Honorable just like he was during his life, he bids farewell to his opponent, before dissolving in a beam of light. Although a playable character in the first game (unlocked via a code), he is not allowed in matches. He has a crouching animation (which is uncommon for some bosses in SNK fighters). His character is based on the historical Miyamoto Musashi.
* is a guardian of the demonic portal known as “Hell’s Gate”. For years, he and the other three guardians stood watch over its seal. For many years it was peaceful and Okina resigned himself to fishing and the complacent life of a hermit. Five years into his life of leisure, he was found by Kaede, who wished to train with him to improve his own sword skills. Okina taught the young man all he knew and Kaede left after he had improved his skills. Sensing the boy&#x27;s departure and inquiry for training as a sign of trouble, Okina followed him at a distance. Despite Kaede preventing the opening of the Gate, it had still not been sealed properly. As the oldest guardian, Okina was aware of that and knew that to properly seal the portal, the legendary “Sealing Maiden” was required to perform the ritual. He also discovered that an assassin called the “Messenger From Afar” was rumored to pursue the maiden. Determined to fulfill his role as a guardian, Okina set out on a journey.
* is characterized by his outlandish mannerisms and flamboyant personality. He uses the element of fire in some of his attacks as well as special techniques involving &quot;sakura&quot; petals. As a carefree and fun-loving individual, Hyo has a strong love for sake, women, and the thrill of the fight. When he discovers the petals of the beautiful cherry trees falling from their branches, he panics and decides he must go defeat opponents to solve the “problem”. In the end, he discovers it was only the changing of the seasons that resulted in the petals falling from the trees. After learning of the cause for the various Sakura trees petals falling, Hyo is devastated to learn that the sky is turning a dreadful gray color due to the re-opening of “Hell&#x27;s Gate”. He draws his sword, but finds it oddly dull and fragile. In order to fix it, he decides to ask his friend Takane Genzō, a master swordsmith, to fix it. However, his friend has died. Amano discovers that he had a daughter, Hibiki Takane, who had recently departed the household. Concerned for his sword and for Hibiki, he sets off to locate her. Hyo&#x27;s ending in both games is interesting in that the player must choose one of two (or three in the first game) choices, each of which causes Hyo to behave differently.
* is characterized as a power-type character in gameplay. He is the adopted brother of Akari Ichijou. Despite this, he and his adoptive family are very close. At home, he is generally free-spirited and somewhat lazy. Sometime during this, he learned how to use a club with his brute strength (apparently to pass the time). While in the course of his usual lying around the house with little to keep him preoccupied, he was knocked out and kidnapped by Akari, who “persuaded” him to accompany her on a journey to discover the landmark known as the “Gate of Hell”. After their adventure, their sister Hikari falls ill and the two become extremely concerned about her health. One day as Juzoh is visiting Hikari, she discloses that their sister Akari had run away to “Hell&#x27;s Gate” again to find a cure for her curse. To lay both their fears to rest, Juzoh pursues her on her quest.
* is considered the main protagonist of the series. He was the son of a warrior named Gaisei, a master swordsman who trained him with two other orphans, Moriya Minakata and Yuki. As he grew, he became an avid swordsman and powerful warrior. One day, when he was twelve, he and Yuki returned from an errand to discover their master slain and Moriya standing over his corpse. Enraged, Kaede physically attacked him for the (presumed) killing of their master. Moriya withstood the attack and left in silence. Shortly thereafter, Kaede and Yuki depart their foster home to avenge the death of their master and confront the killer. Five years on their quest, he still searches for Moriya. He eventually discovers that the real killer of his master was one of the four guardians of hell, Shinnosuke Kagami. He engages him, but the guardian&#x27;s superior skill quickly overpowers him. However, it is revealed that Kaede possesses the power of the legendary dragon &quot;Seiryū&quot;, transforming various physical aspects and giving him additional power. With his transformation into , he defeats Kagami. After honing his skills and learning to control the power of the Seiryū to a greater extent, Kaede and Yuki set off to meet the Genbu no Okina in order to find more information. When they arrive, they discover that the “Sealing Rite” needs to be performed, for a great evil threatens the world. This rite is to be performed by a special maiden, but a warrior named the “Messenger From Afar” seeks to assassinate her and prevent her from performing it. Kaede sets out to protect the maiden and to allow her to accomplish her mission.
* is a fictional unit leader of the real life Shinsengumi, a police-like group during the Bakumatsu era. He is a firm believer in restoring order to Japan, and in the old ways of Samurai sword fighting. As such, he carries a very serious persona. He is extremely loyal to his Shinsengumi unit, and is a friend of Kojiroh Sanada. He is the only one in the unit who is aware that “Kojiroh” is actually Kojiroh&#x27;s sister Kaori.
* (or rather, in his new form) is the legendary warrior that trained Kaede, Yuki and Moriya Minakata. After Shinnosuke Kagami&#x27;s aborted plan to remove the seal on “Hell’s Gate” and bring about a new world order, Gaisei presumably stood up against the guardian in an attempt to stop him. Unfortunately, Shinnosuke is too powerful, and he dies in the battle. He is later discovered by his three students, who all vow to take revenge on his killer. Kaede accomplishes this, activating his power of the Seiryū and defeating Shinnosuke. This also clears Moriya&#x27;s reputation, as he was originally blamed for killing Gaisei. In The Last Blade 2, Gaisei is still deceased. However, an unknown force of evil resurrects him and drives the now-undead warrior insane. Additionally, he manages to combine the legendary powers of Suzaku, Seiryuu, Byakko and Genbu into his being, making him much more powerful than before. The now godlike warrior roams the lands and is called “Kouryu”, the Yellow Dragon.
* hails from Qing dynasty China, where he learned a martial art that allows the user to control fire and involves the use of fans and powerful kicks. One day, he witnessed a “red star” (the opening of “Hell&#x27;s Gate”). Knowing it to be a sign of great evil, he travels from his homeland of China to stop the evil before it spreads across the world. After the closing of the Gate, he remained in Japan. He continued to study and improve his skills in the martial arts while earning a modest living at a nearby farm. When he senses the re-opening of Hell&#x27;s Gate, he stops his training to investigate once more.
* is a young swordsman in training under a legendary teacher named Gaisei. Under his tutelage, along with Kaede and Yuki, he became great swordsman. For many years, they lived happily together while learning bushidō. One day he discovered his master dead, and the killer was nowhere to be found. Kaede sees him over the body, and seeks to slay him under the belief he slew Gaisei. With this, he sets out on the run. Not only does he wish to avoid this confrontation, but he also seeks the man named Shinnosuke Kagami (who was the real killer) in order clear his name. However, after over five years of searching, Moriya has yet to find Kagami, who is defeated by Kaede instead. After failing to take revenge upon Kagami, Moriya recluses himself to the wilderness to improve his skills and techniques. During this time, he finds within himself an urge to “return” to the portal known as “Hell’s Gate”. Ceasing his training, he travels in order to seek the truth.
* is a guardian of a portal called the “Hell’s Gate”. Before the events of the first game, he is magically sealed in a massive stone for ten years by a friend who perceived him to be a threat. He eventually escaped, but clouded by his rage and anger, he could only think of getting back at his captor. He set out to exact revenge.
* is a previous member of the &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;, an organization that was to protect the weak. However, Shikyoh merely joined to kill innocents. When his superiors and comrades discovered this, they resolved to punish him, but he escaped before they could take action. When he discovered the opening of the “Hell’s Gate”, he thought it a perfect opportunity to continue his killing spree and set out in search of more prey. After his death, Shikyoh was re-animated in the form of a zombie named . With his love of killing still fresh in his mind along with his few memories and fighting style, Mukuro wanders the land in his undead form, continuing to kill innocents.
* is featured as a boss character in &quot;The Last Blade&quot; and was toned down to be regular playable character in the sequel. Shinnosuke is one of the guardians of “Hell’s Gate”, a portal that allows demons and evil energy to seep through to the mortal plane humans call Earth. After residing over his position and finding (or so he thought) that the humans he protected were weak and inferior to himself, he decides to release the seal on the portal. Along with this, he goes on a horrific killing spree, murdering various warriors including Gaisei. After five years of preparatory action to unseal the gate, including imprisoning his fellow guardian, Shigen Naoe, Shinnosuke is eventually found by Kaede, who has the latent power of the &quot;Seiryū&quot;. Kaede defeats him; humiliated by his defeat, Shinnosuke is thrown into the depths of Hell&#x27;s Gate as eternal punishment. However, he is soon reincarnated in a new form to fulfill his role as a guardian, as the portal is being opened by another force. Shinnosuke sets out to fulfill his destiny, and to seek atonement.
* is the daughter of a foreign family that managed ship trades; unfortunately, her family died in a ship accident. She is later adopted by Gaisei, who trains her along with two other students: Moriya Minakata and Kaede. Unlike her fellow companions, she picks up the naginata instead of the katana. She also secretly harbors feelings for Moriya over the course of her training. The year she turns 13, she returns with Kaede to find their teacher dead and Moriya standing over the body. Mortified, she watched as Kaede attacked Moriya. Moriya silently took his leave shortly thereafter. She and Kaede then embarked on a five-year journey, eventually discovering the truth: a powerful swordsman named Shinnosuke Kagami was the one who had murdered their master. She assists Kaede in defeating Kagami, both avenging their master&#x27;s death and clearing Moriya&#x27;s name.
* is one of the last of numerous ninja clans that roam ancient Japan. Due to the decline of the ninja population, the Japanese common folk begin to consider the title “ninja” a thing to scoff at. Determined to prove the superiority of his people, he challenges warriors time and time again to prove his strength. When he hears of the opening of a portal called “Hell’s Gate”, he sets out to defeat the enemies within to prove his strength. He is heavily implied to be the ancestor of Eiji Kisaragi from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series.

All of the characters in the &quot;Last Blade&quot; series are of Japanese origin, excluding Lee Rekka, who is from China, and Yuki, who is from Russia. Some characters, such as Akatsuki Musashi and Lee Rekka, are based on historical or legendary figures.

<text>Viscount Colville of Culross, in the County of Perth, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 July 1902 for the politician and courtier, Charles Colville, 10th Lord Colville of Culross. He had already been created Baron Colville of Culross, in the County of Perth, in 1885, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. , the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the fifth Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2010. The fourth Viscount was a judge and politician. Lord Colville of Culross was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remained in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat as a crossbencher.

The title of Lord Colville of Culross was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1604 for Sir James Colville, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. The title descended among his male heirs until the death of his grandson, the fourth Lord, in c. 1680. He was succeeded by his fourth cousin Alexander Colville, the fifth Lord. His grandson, the seventh Lord, was a distinguished naval commander. His nephew, the ninth Lord, was an Admiral of the White and also sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1818 to 1849. He was succeeded by his nephew, the aforementioned tenth Lord, who was elevated to a viscountcy in 1902.

Admiral Sir Stanley Colville (1861–1939) was the second son of the 1st Viscount. The diarist Sir John &quot;Jock&quot; Colville (1915–1987) was the third son of the third son of the 1st Viscount.

&quot;Culross&quot; is pronounced &quot;Coo-ros&quot;. It is a historic village on the Firth of Forth; it was transferred to in Fife in 1891, and some of its buildings are maintained by the National Trust for Scotland. The titles emanate from an historic Colville connection to Culross Abbey and the Abbot of Culross. The first Lord Colville was awarded the lands of Culross Abbey in June 1592 and its title by James VI, rewarded for services to the Crown especially as a diplomat abroad in religious causes.

The family seat was Worlingham Hall, near Beccles, Suffolk.

<text>A subset of absolute idealism, British idealism was a philosophical movement that was influential in Britain from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. The leading figures in the movement were T. H. Green (1836–1882), F. H. Bradley (1846–1924), and Bernard Bosanquet (1848–1923). They were succeeded by the second generation of J. H. Muirhead (1855–1940), J. M. E. McTaggart (1866–1925), H. H. Joachim (1868–1938), A. E. Taylor (1869–1945), and R. G. Collingwood (1889–1943). The last major figure in the tradition was G. R. G. Mure (1893–1979). Doctrines of early British idealism so provoked the young Cambridge philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell that they began a new philosophical tradition, analytic philosophy.

==Overview==
British idealism was generally marked by several broad tendencies: a belief in an Absolute (a single all-encompassing reality that in some sense formed a coherent and all-inclusive system); the assignment of a high place to reason as both the faculty by which the Absolute&#x27;s structure is grasped and as that structure itself; and a fundamental unwillingness to accept a dichotomy between thought and object, reality consisting of thought-and-object together in a strongly coherent unity.

British idealism largely developed from the German idealist movement—particularly such philosophers as Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel, who were characterised by Green, among others, as the salvation of British philosophy after the alleged demise of empiricism. Thomas Carlyle did much to bring awareness of German idealism to the English-speaking world, and his own contributions were also highly influential on British idealism. The movement was a reaction against the thinking of John Locke, David Hume, John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, and other empiricists and utilitarians.

Up until the early 1860s accurate translations of Hegel&#x27;s works were not available in Britain. However, this situation changed in 1865 with the publication of James Hutchison Stirling&#x27;s book &quot;The Secret of Hegel&quot;, which is believed to have won significant converts in Britain.

British idealism was influenced by Hegel at least in broad outline, and undeniably adopted some of Hegel&#x27;s terminology and doctrines. Examples include not only the aforementioned Absolute, but also a doctrine of internal relations, a coherence theory of truth, and a concept of a concrete universal. Some commentators have also pointed to a sort of dialectical structure in e.g. some of the writings of Bradley. But few of the British idealists adopted Hegel&#x27;s philosophy wholesale, and his most significant writings on logic seem to have found no purchase whatsoever in their thought. On the other hand, G. R. G. Mure was &quot;a deep student of Hegel&quot; 
who &quot;was committed to Hegel&#x27;s &#x27;central ontological thesis&#x27; all his life.&quot;

On its political side, the British idealists were largely concerned to refute what they regarded as a brittle and &quot;atomistic&quot; form of individualism, as espoused by e.g. Herbert Spencer, but also the utilitarianism of J.S. Mill and the &#x27;socialism&#x27; of the Fabian Socialism such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb. On the idealist view, humans are fundamentally social beings in a manner and to a degree not adequately recognized by Spencer and his followers, yet individual initiative and &#x27;self-realisation&#x27; are also central to their accounts. The British Idealists did not, however, reify the State in the manner that Hegel allegedly did; Green in particular spoke of the individual as the sole locus of value and contended that the State&#x27;s existence was justified only insofar as it contributed to the realization of value in the lives of individual persons. Figures, such as Green and Bosanquet were active in social reform, as well.

The hold of British idealism in the United Kingdom weakened when Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, who were educated in the British idealist tradition, turned against it. In the late 1950s G. R. G. Mure, in his &quot;Retreat From Truth&quot; (Oxford 1958), criticized Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and aspects of analytic philosophy from an idealist point of view.

British idealism was influential not only in Britain, but in philosophy throughout the British Empire as well as in East Asia.
Philosophers such as Alfred Hoernlé in South Africa, John Watson in Canada, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan in India and Yang Changji in China, drew on idealist metaphysics and political philosophy in developing their own idealist views. British idealism&#x27;s influence in the United States was somewhat limited. The early thought of Josiah Royce had something of a neo-Hegelian cast, as did that of a handful of his less famous contemporaries. The American rationalist Brand Blanshard was strongly influenced by Bradley, Bosanquet, and Green (and other British philosophers). Even this limited influence, though, petered out through the latter half of the twentieth century. However, from the 1990s on, there has been a significant revival in interest in these ideas, as evidenced by, for instance, by the founding of the Michael Oakeshott Association, and renewed attention to the work of Collingwood, Green, and Bosanquet.

<doc id="472126" wikidata="Q5206574" url="?curid=472126" title="DX-pedition">
<text>A DX-pedition is an expedition to what is considered an exotic place by amateur radio operators and DX listeners, typically because of its remoteness, access restrictions, or simply because there are very few radio amateurs active from that place. This could be an island, a country, or even a particular spot on a geographical grid. &quot;DX&quot; is a telegraphic shorthand for &quot;distance&quot; or &quot;distant&quot; (see DXing).

==History==

Early DX-peditions were simply exploratory and geographical expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s, in which one or more radio amateurs participated to provide long-distance communications. At the same time they communicated with fellow radio amateurs who wanted to contact a new country. Most notable are the Antarctic expeditions of Admiral Byrd. Another example is the voyage of the schooner &quot;Kaimiloa&quot;, which traveled the South Pacific in 1924. While the ship&#x27;s wealthy owners enjoyed the islands, an amateur radio operator kept contact with, and sent QSL cards to, experimenters in the United States.

The participation of radio amateurs in geographical expeditions was resumed after World War II, e.g. the participation of Bill Snyder, W0LHS, and Bob Leo, W6PBV, in the Gatti-Hallicrafters expedition in Africa of 1948. The most unusual expedition to place reliance on amateur radio for communications was that of Kon-Tiki organized by Thor Heyerdahl in 1947 and using call sign LI2B.

The activity of dedicated DX-peditions was pioneered by one-time ARRL president Robert W. Denniston, W0DX. Mr. Denniston&#x27;s 1948 DX-pedition, using call sign VP7NG, was to the Bahamas and was called &quot;Gon-Waki&quot; à la Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; expedition the previous year.

==DX-peditions and awards==
DX-peditions are planned and organized to help operators who need to contact that area to obtain an amateur radio award. There are several awards sponsored by various organizations based on contacting many countries. Perhaps the most famous of these is the DX Century Club (DXCC) award sponsored by the ARRL. The base level of this award involves contacting and confirming 100 distinct geographical entities defined by the ARRL – usually politically distinct countries, and sometimes well-separated administrative or geographical regions within them, such as outlying islands.

There are currently 340 separate entities recognized for award purposes. An &quot;entity&quot; for such purposes is any location that is either politically separate or physically remote (or both) from other jurisdictions / locations. For example:
* Even though Alaska and Hawaii are political units of the United States, they are separate DX entities (physically separate regions).
* Small independent countries, even ones embedded within larger ones, such as the Vatican and Monaco, count.
* Other entities include transnational organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union, and the United Nations. These are within their host countries but have distinct ITU prefixes.
* Finally, a few areas of historic or special status have been included, such as Sardinia, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Antarctica, and Western Sahara.

While the ARRL criteria for new entities were rationalized in 1999, those entities introduced before that date under relatively lax rules remain on the list, so long as they satisfy the original criteria.

Other DX-peditions focus on operation from islands with little or no local radio amateur activity, for the Islands on the Air (IOTA) award which is sponsored by the Radio Society of Great Britain. A small number of DX-peditions focus on activating specific, remote Maidenhead locator squares for the benefit of VHF and UHF operators.

==Locations==
Many DX-peditions take place from locations with adequate access to power and supplies, often where the country has a small resident amateur population or where licensing is not very difficult. Many Caribbean and Pacific island nations, as well as European micro-states, have very small populations, but have hotels, reliable power, and supplies, and are easy to gain operating permission in. Therefore, these states are regularly activated by amateurs, often in combination with a family holiday.

Other jurisdictions take a more stringent view of individual access to communications equipment, and are rare because very few amateurs are licensed in those countries and visitors find it difficult or impossible to gain operating permits or import amateur radio equipment. Examples include North Korea, Mount Athos and Yemen.

Some locations are also rare due to their extreme inaccessibility—examples include Peter I Island, Campbell Island, Clipperton Island, Navassa Island, or Desecheo Island. When amateurs travel to remote locations such as these they must first obtain permission to operate from that location from whatever political jurisdiction rules the area they wish to travel to. Even in countries such as the United States, this permission can be difficult and costly to obtain. For example, a recent DXpedition to Jarvis Island in August 2024 required a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for access to and use of Jarvis Island National Wildlife Refuge, which cost the team $27,000.

Once operating permission is assured, then transportation must be arranged. This can be both expensive and dangerous. Some locations are coral atolls that are almost submerged at high tide, such as Scarborough Reef; others are sub-polar islands with inhospitable climates such as Peter I Island. The amateur must also take care of the basic necessities such as food, water, and power.

==Equipment and operation==
In addition to licensing and survival issues, DX-pedition participants devote much attention to the radio equipment they use.

In an extremely rare location for a popular awards program like DXCC, hundreds of stations may be calling the DX-pedition at any one time (known as a &#x27;pile-up&#x27;). Therefore, DX-peditioners will aim to use high power and gain antennas on as many bands as practical, to achieve a loud signal worldwide and keep control of the inevitable pileups that occur. Operators may also receive and transmit on different frequencies, called split operation, to be heard by distant stations without interference to their signal from the pile-up. This can also help the operation to make a substantial number of contacts with parts of the planet that have unfavourable propagation from the area visited, lying perhaps in the region on the Earth&#x27;s surface which is diametrically opposite to it—its antipodal point. Examples would be the Central Pacific from Europe, or the Caribbean from Japan.

For smaller operations to remote locations, smaller radios which run off of a 12 V DC power supply and antenna systems which are more easily transported are favored over larger and more difficult to transport equipment. However, generators are usually used because of the power requirements for amplifiers and the ease of refueling versus recharging a battery.

When the individual or group arrives at the DX-pedition destination, they must set up their station and get on the air. DX-peditions are usually group affairs since the desire is to make as many contacts as possible from the location. Round-the-clock operations on multiple HF bands simultaneously are typical, which necessitates a group activity. The use of the Internet to upload logs (allowing quick confirmation of questionable contacts) and for QSLs (formal confirmation) has made the process somewhat easier.

Holiday operations from locations where there are few resident operators are often more leisurely affairs. Nonetheless, the operator will seek to make as many contacts as possible in the operating time available, with the result that contacts are often extremely brief, limited just to an exchange of signal reports.

==Contests==
Many DX-peditions are organized around various radio contests that happen throughout the year. This is often done so that the DX-pedition station can gain an advantage in contests and maximize the number of contacts that they make during the DX-pedition, since the radio bands are the most active during contests.

==DX-peditions with most contacts==
* In October 2011, the T32C Kiritimati (Christmas Island, eastern Kiribati) DXpedition, run by the Five Star DXers Association, claimed 213,169 contacts.
* This broke the February 2008 record set by the Ducie Island (eastern Pitcairn group) DXpedition, which claimed 183,686 QSOs under the callsign VP6DX.
* This in turn had broken the previous record of 168,000 contacts set in 2001 by D68C (also by the FSDXA) from the Galawa Beach Hotel on the Comoros island of Grande Comore.
* The January 2012 trip to Malpelo Island had 195,625 contacts. While not an absolute record, it was the largest total ever achieved by a DX-pedition where the members lived in tents and powered their radios by portable generators.

<doc id="472129" wikidata="Q1478274" url="?curid=472129" title="Kaprekar number">
<text>In mathematics, a natural number in a given number base is a formula_1-Kaprekar number if the representation of its square in that base can be split into two parts, where the second part has formula_1 digits, that add up to the original number. For example, in base 10, 45 is a 2-Kaprekar number, because 45² = 2025, and 20 + 25 = 45. The numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar.

== Definition and properties ==
Let formula_3 be a natural number. Then the Kaprekar function for base formula_4 and power formula_5 formula_6 is defined to be the following:
:formula_7, 
where formula_8 and 
:formula_9
A natural number formula_3 is a formula_1-Kaprekar number if it is a fixed point for formula_12, which occurs if formula_13. formula_14 and formula_15 are trivial Kaprekar numbers for all formula_16 and formula_1, all other Kaprekar numbers are nontrivial Kaprekar numbers.

The earlier example of 45 satisfies this definition with formula_18 and formula_19, because
: formula_20
: formula_21
: formula_22

A natural number formula_3 is a sociable Kaprekar number if it is a periodic point for formula_12, where formula_25 for a positive integer formula_26 (where formula_27 is the formula_26th iterate of formula_12), and forms a cycle of period formula_26. A Kaprekar number is a sociable Kaprekar number with formula_31, and a amicable Kaprekar number is a sociable Kaprekar number with formula_32.

The number of iterations formula_33 needed for formula_34 to reach a fixed point is the Kaprekar function&#x27;s persistence of formula_3, and undefined if it never reaches a fixed point.

There are only a finite number of formula_1-Kaprekar numbers and cycles for a given base formula_16, because if formula_38, where formula_39 then 

: formula_40

and formula_41, formula_42, and formula_43. Only when formula_44 do Kaprekar numbers and cycles exist. 

If formula_45 is any divisor of formula_1, then formula_3 is also a formula_1-Kaprekar number for base formula_49. 

In base formula_50, all even perfect numbers are Kaprekar numbers. More generally, any numbers of the form formula_51 or formula_52 for natural number formula_3 are Kaprekar numbers in base 2.

===Set-theoretic definition and unitary divisors===
The set formula_54 for a given integer formula_55 can be defined as the set of integers formula_56 for which there exist natural numbers formula_57 and formula_58 satisfying the Diophantine equation
: formula_59, where formula_60
: formula_61
An formula_3-Kaprekar number for base formula_16 is then one which lies in the set formula_64.

It was shown in 2000 that there is a bijection between the unitary divisors of formula_65 and the set formula_54 defined above. Let formula_67 denote the multiplicative inverse of formula_68 modulo formula_69, namely the least positive integer formula_70 such that formula_71, and for each unitary divisor formula_45 of formula_65 let formula_74 and formula_75. Then the function formula_76 is a bijection from the set of unitary divisors of formula_65 onto the set formula_54. In particular, a number formula_56 is in the set formula_54 if and only if formula_81 for some unitary divisor formula_45 of formula_65.

The numbers in formula_54 occur in complementary pairs, formula_56 and formula_86. If formula_45 is a unitary divisor of formula_65 then so is formula_74, and if formula_90 then formula_91.

==Kaprekar numbers for formula_12==
===&quot;b&quot; = 4&quot;k&quot; + 3 and &quot;p&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; + 1===
Let formula_26 and formula_3 be natural numbers, the number base formula_95, and formula_96. Then: 
* formula_97 is a Kaprekar number.
* formula_98 is a Kaprekar number for all natural numbers formula_3.
===&quot;b&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot; + 1 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;mn&quot; + 1===
Let formula_70, formula_26, and formula_3 be natural numbers, the number base formula_103, and the power formula_104. Then: 
* formula_105 is a Kaprekar number.
* formula_106 is a Kaprekar number.

===&quot;b&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot; + 1 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;mn&quot; + &quot;m&quot; − 1===
Let formula_70, formula_26, and formula_3 be natural numbers, the number base formula_103, and the power formula_111. Then: 
* formula_112 is a Kaprekar number.
* formula_113 is a Kaprekar number.

===&quot;b&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot;2 − &quot;m&quot; + 1 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;mn&quot; + 1===
Let formula_70, formula_26, and formula_3 be natural numbers, the number base formula_117, and the power formula_111. Then: 
* formula_119 is a Kaprekar number.
* formula_120 is a Kaprekar number.

===&quot;b&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot;2 − &quot;m&quot; + 1 and &quot;p&quot; = &quot;mn&quot; + &quot;m&quot; − 1===
Let formula_70, formula_26, and formula_3 be natural numbers, the number base formula_117, and the power formula_111. Then: 
* formula_105 is a Kaprekar number.
* formula_127 is a Kaprekar number.

== Kaprekar numbers and cycles of formula_12 for specific formula_1, formula_16 ==
All numbers are in base formula_16.
==Extension to negative integers==
Kaprekar numbers can be extended to the negative integers by use of a signed-digit representation to represent each integer.

<doc id="472132" wikidata="Q601928" url="?curid=472132" title="Antonio Fazio">
<text>Antonio Fazio (born 11 October 1936 in Alvito, province of Frosinone) is an Italian banker, who was the Governor of Banca d&#x27;Italia from 1993 until his resignation amidst controversy in 2005.

After graduating in economics in 1960, he continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was assistant professor of Demographics at the Faculty of Economics of Rome University (La Sapienza) and Economic Consultant to the Economic Research Department of the Bank of Italy, which he joined as a staff economist in 1966.

He is reported to be very religious, and close to the Vatican. He has five children.

==Career==
He started work at the Bank of Italy in 1960. In 1993, after his predecessor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi left office to become the Italian Prime Minister, he became governor of the Bank of Italy. Some years after his appointment, it was said that he was interested in the leadership of the left-wing coalition to beat Berlusconi&#x27;s right wing one. After Berlusconi won the 2001 general election, however, he came to be considered closer to the centre-right.

==The Antonveneta affair==
In 2005, Fazio came under heavy pressure to resign (which he eventually did) over his role in allegedly rigging the competition to take over an Italian bank, Banca Antonveneta, earlier in the year. Published excerpts of tapped telephone calls strongly suggest that Fazio favoured an Italian bid, probably in order to sabotage a foreign bid from Dutch bank ABN AMRO.

===Reaction of the government===
Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government, itself in troubled times because of the utter defeat in the regional elections of April 2005, was accused of weakness for not kicking Fazio out of office. On 21 September 2005, economy minister Domenico Siniscalco resigned in protest against the lack of determination in the government. The government maintained that it had no power to remove the governor of the central bank.

===Investigations and resignation===
Gianpiero Fiorani was arrested on 14 December 2005 for investigation of his role in the affair, and Fazio was officially put under investigation in Milan for insider trading on 16 December. He is also under investigation in Rome for having pressured the apparatus of the Bank of Italy to give green light to Fiorani&#x27;s takeover of Antonveneta.

Although he had resisted calls to resign for months, these latest developments were the last straw, and Fazio stepped down on 19 December 2005. A new governor, Mario Draghi, was appointed on 29 December 2005.

On 28 May 2011, An Italian court sentenced him four years in jail for market-rigging related to a 2005 takeover battle over Italian bank Banca Antonveneta. A Milan court has also ordered Fazio – who headed the Bank of Italy from 1993 to 2005 – to pay a 1.5 million euro ($2.14 million) fine for his role in the takeover saga pitting Dutch Bank ABN AMRO against Italy&#x27;s Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI).

<text>Baron Churchill, of Wychwood in the County of Oxford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and held by a branch of the Spencer family. It was created in 1815 for Lord Francis Spencer, younger son of the 4th Duke of Marlborough (see Duke of Marlborough for earlier history of the family). He had previously represented Oxfordshire in Parliament.

From 1902 to 2017, the barony was subsidiary title of the viscountcy of Churchill. The title of Viscount Churchill, of Rolleston in the County of Leicester, was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 15 July 1902 for the first baron&#x27;s grandson Conservative politician Victor Spencer, 3rd Baron Churchill. The viscountcy became extinct in 2017 on the death of the first Viscount&#x27;s youngest son, the third Viscount, who had succeeded his half-brother, the second Viscount, in 1973.

The barony was inherited by the last Viscount&#x27;s second cousin once removed, the great-grandson of General Sir Augustus Almeric Spencer, the third son of the 1st Baron Churchill.

<text>Robin George Collingwood (; 22 February 1889 – 9 January 1943) was an English philosopher, historian and archaeologist. He is best known for his philosophical works, including &quot;The Principles of Art&quot; (1938) and the posthumously published &quot;The Idea of History&quot; (1946).

==Biography==
Collingwood was born 22 February 1889 in Cartmel, Grange-over-Sands, then in Lancashire (now Cumbria), the son of the artist and archaeologist W.G. Collingwood, who acted as John Ruskin&#x27;s private secretary in the final years of Ruskin&#x27;s life. Collingwood&#x27;s mother was also an artist and a talented pianist. He was educated at Rugby School and University College, Oxford, where he gained a First in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) in 1910 and a congratulatory First in Greats (Ancient History and Philosophy) in 1912. Prior to graduation, he was elected a fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford.

Collingwood was a fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, for some 23 years until becoming the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was taught by the historian and archaeologist F. J. Haverfield, at the time Camden Professor of Ancient History. Important influences on Collingwood were the Italian Idealists Benedetto Croce, Giovanni Gentile and Guido de Ruggiero, the last of whom was also a close friend. Other important influences were Hegel, Kant, Giambattista Vico, F. H. Bradley and J. A. Smith.

After several years of increasingly debilitating strokes, Collingwood died at Coniston, Lancashire, on 9 January 1943. He was a practising Anglican throughout his life.

==Philosopher==
Collingwood defined philosophy as &quot;thought of the second degree, thought about thought&quot;. An astronomer investigates phenomena and provides a theory from their observations, if the astronomer were to think about their process this would be philosophy.
===Philosophy of history===
Collingwood is widely noted for &quot;The Idea of History&quot; (1946), which was collated from various sources soon after his death by a student, T. M. Knox. It came to be a major inspiration for philosophy of history in the English-speaking world and is extensively cited, leading to an ironic remark by commentator Louis Mink that Collingwood is coming to be &quot;the best known neglected thinker of our time&quot;. Collingwood is quoted multiple times in E.H. Carr&#x27;s famous book What is History?.

Collingwood categorized history as a science, defining a science as &quot;any organized body of knowledge.&quot; However, he distinguished history from natural sciences because the concerns of these two branches are different: natural sciences are concerned with the physical world, while history, in its most common usage, is concerned with social sciences and human affairs. Collingwood pointed out a fundamental difference between knowing things in the present (or in the natural sciences) and knowing history. To come to know things in the present or about things in the natural sciences, &quot;real&quot; things can be observed, as they are in existence or that have substance right now.

Since the internal thought processes of historical persons cannot be perceived with the physical senses and past historical events cannot be directly observed, history must be methodologically different from natural sciences. History, being a study of the human mind, is interested in the thoughts and motivations of the actors in history, this insight being encapsulated in his epigram &quot;All history is the history of thought.&quot; Therefore, Collingwood suggested that a historian must &quot;reconstruct&quot; history by using &quot;historical imagination&quot; to &quot;re-enact&quot; the thought processes of historical persons based on information and evidence from historical sources. Re-enactment of thought refers to the idea that the historian can access not only a thought process similar to that of the historical actor, but the actual thought process itself. Consider Collingwood&#x27;s words regarding the study of Plato:

In Collingwood&#x27;s understanding, a thought is a single entity accessible to the public and therefore, regardless of how many people have the same thought, it is still a singular thought. &quot;Thoughts, in other words, are to be distinguished on the basis of purely qualitative criteria, and if there are two people entertaining the (qualitatively) same thought, there is (numerically) only one thought since there is only one propositional content.&quot; Therefore, if historians follow the correct line of inquiry in response to a historical source and reason correctly, they can arrive at the same thought the author of their source had and, in so doing, &quot;re-enact&quot; that thought.

Collingwood rejected what he deemed &quot;scissors-and-paste history&quot; in which the historian rejects a statement recorded by their subject either because it contradicts another historical statement or because it contradicts the historian&#x27;s own understanding of the world. As he states in &quot;Principles of History,&quot; sometimes a historian will encounter &quot;a story which he simply cannot believe, a story characteristic, perhaps, of the superstitions or prejudices of the author&#x27;s time or the circle in which he lived, but not credible to a more enlightened age, and therefore to be omitted.&quot; This, Collingwood argues, is an unacceptable way to do history. Sources which make claims that do not align with current understandings of the world were still created by rational humans who had reason for creating them. Therefore, these sources are valuable and ought to be investigated further in order to get at the historical context in which they were created and for what reason.

===Philosophy of art===
&quot;The Principles of Art&quot; (1938) comprises Collingwood&#x27;s most developed treatment of aesthetic questions. Collingwood held (following Benedetto Croce) that works of art are essentially expressions of emotion. For Collingwood, an important social role for artists is to clarify and articulate emotions from their community.

Collingwood considered &#x27;magic&#x27; to be a form of art, as opposed to superstition or &#x27;bad science&#x27;. Magic for Collingwood is a practical exercise to bring about a certain emotional state. For example magic like a war dance before a battle is a ritual whereby the warriors work themselves up into a particular emotive state in order to do battle. In giving such a conception Collingwood hoped to address the issue of the word &#x27;magic&#x27; having &quot;no definite significance at all&quot;, he intended to ameliorate this by making it a term &quot;with a definite meaning&quot;. He accuses anthropologists of prejudice when analyzing the magical practices of previous generations, as they assumed that it must fulfill the same purpose of modern science. 

Collingwood developed a position later known as aesthetic expressivism (not to be confused with various other views typically called expressivism), a thesis first developed by Croce.

===Political philosophy===
In politics Collingwood defended the ideals of what he called liberalism &quot;in its Continental sense&quot;:

In his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Collingwood confessed that his politics had always been &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;, and shared Guido de Ruggiero&#x27;s opinion that socialism had rendered a great service to liberalism by pointing out the shortcomings of laissez-faire economics.

==Archaeologist==
Collingwood was not just a philosopher of history but also a practising historian and archaeologist. He was, during his time, a leading authority on Roman Britain: he spent his term time at Oxford teaching philosophy but devoted his long vacations to archaeology.

He began work along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. The family home was at Coniston in the Lake District and his father was a leading figure in the Cumberland and Westmorland Archaeological Society. Collingwood was drawn in on a number of excavations and put forward the theory that Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was not so much a fighting platform but an elevated sentry walk. He also put forward the suggestion that Hadrian&#x27;s defensive system also included a number of forts along the Cumberland coast.

He was very active in the 1930 Wall Pilgrimage for which he prepared the ninth edition of Bruce&#x27;s Handbook.

His final and most controversial excavation in Cumbria was that of a circular ring ditch near Penrith known as King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table in 1937. It appeared to be a Neolithic henge monument, and Collingwood&#x27;s excavations, failing to find conclusive evidence of Neolithic activity, nevertheless found the base of two stone pillars, a possible cremation trench and some post holes. Sadly, his subsequent ill health prevented him undertaking a second season so the work was handed over to the German prehistorian Gerhard Bersu, who queried some of Collingwood&#x27;s findings. However, recently, Grace Simpson, the daughter of the excavator F. G. Simpson, has queried Bersu&#x27;s work and largely rehabilitated Collingwood as an excavator.

He also began what was to be the major work of his archaeological career, preparing a corpus of the &quot;Roman Inscriptions of Britain&quot;, which involved travelling all over Britain to see the inscriptions and draw them; he eventually prepared drawings of nearly 900 inscriptions. It was finally published in 1965 by his student R. P. Wright.

He also published two major archaeological works. The first was &quot;The Archaeology of Roman Britain&quot;, a handbook in sixteen chapters covering first the archaeological sites (fortresses, towns and temples and portable antiquities) inscriptions, coins, pottery and brooches. Mortimer Wheeler in a review, remarked that &quot;it seemed at first a trifle off beat that he should immerse himself in so much museum-like detail ... but I felt sure that this was incidental to his primary mission to organise his own thinking&quot;.

However, his most important work was his contribution to the first volume of the Oxford History of England, &quot;Roman Britain and the English Settlements&quot;, of which he wrote the major part, Nowell Myres adding the second smaller part on English settlements. The book was in many ways revolutionary for it set out to write the story of Roman Britain from an archaeological rather than a historical viewpoint, putting into practice his own belief in &#x27;Question and Answer&#x27; archaeology.

The result was alluring and influential. However, as Ian Richmond wrote, &#x27;The general reader may discover too late that it has one major defect. It does not sufficiently distinguish between objective and subjective and combines both in a subtle and apparently objective presentation&#x27;.

The most notorious passage is that on Romano-British art: &quot;the impression that constantly haunts the archaeologist, like a bad smell, is that of an ugliness that plagues the place like a London fog&quot;.

Collingwood&#x27;s most important contribution to British archaeology was his insistence on Question and Answer archaeology: excavations should not take place unless there is a question to be answered. It is a philosophy which, as Anthony Birley points out, has been incorporated by English Heritage into the conditions for Scheduled Monuments Consent. Still, it has always been surprising that the proponents of the &quot;new&quot; archaeology in the 1960s and the 70s have entirely ignored the work of Collingwood, the one major archaeologist who was also a major professional philosopher. He has been described as an early proponent of archaeological theory.

==Author==
Outside archaeology and philosophy, he also published the travel book &quot;The First Mate&#x27;s Log of a Voyage to Greece&quot; (1940), an account of a yachting voyage in the Mediterranean, in the company of several of his students.

Arthur Ransome was a family friend, and learned to sail in their boat, subsequently teaching his sibling&#x27;s children to sail. Ransome loosely based the Swallows in &quot;Swallows and Amazons series&quot; on his sibling&#x27;s children.

<doc id="472147" wikidata="Q1782332" url="?curid=472147" title="Divisible group">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in the field of group theory, a divisible group is an abelian group in which every element can, in some sense, be divided by positive integers, or more accurately, every element is an &quot;n&quot;th multiple for each positive integer &quot;n&quot;. Divisible groups are important in understanding the structure of abelian groups, especially because they are the injective abelian groups.

==Definition==

An abelian group formula_1 is divisible if, for every positive integer formula_2 and every formula_3, there exists formula_4 such that formula_5. An equivalent condition is: for any positive integer formula_2, formula_7, since the existence of formula_8 for every formula_2 and formula_10 implies that formula_11, and the other direction formula_12 is true for every group. A third equivalent condition is that an abelian group formula_13 is divisible if and only if formula_13 is an injective object in the category of abelian groups; for this reason, a divisible group is sometimes called an injective group.

An abelian group is formula_15-divisible for a prime formula_15 if for every formula_3, there exists formula_4 such that formula_19. Equivalently, an abelian group is formula_15-divisible if and only if formula_21.

==Examples==

* The rational numbers formula_22 form a divisible group under addition.
* More generally, the underlying additive group of any vector space over formula_22 is divisible.
* Every quotient of a divisible group is divisible. Thus, formula_24 is divisible.
* The &quot;p&quot;-primary component formula_25 of formula_26, which is isomorphic to the &quot;p&quot;-quasicyclic group formula_27, is divisible.
* The multiplicative group of the complex numbers formula_28 is divisible.
* Every existentially closed abelian group (in the model theoretic sense) is divisible.

==Properties==
* If a divisible group is a subgroup of an abelian group then it is a direct summand of that abelian group.
* Every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group. Put another way, the category of abelian groups has enough injectives.
* Non-trivial divisible groups are not finitely generated.
* Further, every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group as an essential subgroup in a unique way.
* An abelian group is divisible if and only if it is &quot;p&quot;-divisible for every prime &quot;p&quot;.
* Let formula_29 be a ring. If formula_30 is a divisible group, then formula_31 is injective in the category of formula_29-modules.

==Structure theorem of divisible groups==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a divisible group. Then the torsion subgroup Tor(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; is divisible. Since a divisible group is an injective module, Tor(&quot;G&quot;) is a direct summand of &quot;G&quot;. So

:formula_33

As a quotient of a divisible group, &quot;G&quot;/Tor(&quot;G&quot;) is divisible. Moreover, it is torsion-free. Thus, it is a vector space over Q and so there exists a set &quot;I&quot; such that

:formula_34

The structure of the torsion subgroup is harder to determine, but one can show that for all prime numbers &quot;p&quot; there exists formula_35 such that

:formula_36

where formula_37 is the &quot;p&quot;-primary component of Tor(&quot;G&quot;).

Thus, if P is the set of prime numbers,

:formula_38

The cardinalities of the sets &quot;I&quot; and &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot; for &quot;p&quot; ∈ P are uniquely determined by the group &quot;G&quot;.

==Injective envelope==

As stated above, any abelian group &quot;A&quot; can be uniquely embedded in a divisible group &quot;D&quot; as an essential subgroup. This divisible group &quot;D&quot; is the injective envelope of &quot;A&quot;, and this concept is the injective hull in the category of abelian groups.

==Reduced abelian groups==

An abelian group is said to be reduced if its only divisible subgroup is {0}. Every abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible subgroup and a reduced subgroup. In fact, there is a unique largest divisible subgroup of any group, and this divisible subgroup is a direct summand. This is a special feature of hereditary rings like the integers Z: the direct sum of injective modules is injective because the ring is Noetherian, and the quotients of injectives are injective because the ring is hereditary, so any submodule generated by injective modules is injective. The converse is a result of : if every module has a unique maximal injective submodule, then the ring is hereditary.

A complete classification of countable reduced periodic abelian groups is given by Ulm&#x27;s theorem.

==Generalization==

Several distinct definitions generalize divisible groups to divisible modules. The following definitions have been used in the literature to define a divisible module &quot;M&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot;:
# &quot;rM&quot; = &quot;M&quot; for all nonzero &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;. (It is sometimes required that &quot;r&quot; is not a zero-divisor, and some authors require that &quot;R&quot; is a domain.)
# For every principal left ideal &quot;Ra&quot;, any homomorphism from &quot;Ra&quot; into &quot;M&quot; extends to a homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; into &quot;M&quot;. (This type of divisible module is also called &quot;principally injective module&quot;.)
# For every finitely generated left ideal &quot;L&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, any homomorphism from &quot;L&quot; into &quot;M&quot; extends to a homomorphism from &quot;R&quot; into &quot;M&quot;.

The last two conditions are &quot;restricted versions&quot; of the Baer&#x27;s criterion for injective modules. Since injective left modules extend homomorphisms from &quot;all&quot; left ideals to &quot;R&quot;, injective modules are clearly divisible in sense 2 and 3.

If &quot;R&quot; is additionally a domain then all three definitions coincide. If &quot;R&quot; is a principal left ideal domain, then divisible modules coincide with injective modules. Thus in the case of the ring of integers Z, which is a principal ideal domain, a Z-module (which is exactly an abelian group) is divisible if and only if it is injective.

If &quot;R&quot; is a commutative domain, then the injective &quot;R&quot; modules coincide with the divisible &quot;R&quot; modules if and only if &quot;R&quot; is a Dedekind domain.

<text>Viscount Camrose, of Hackwood Park in the County of Hampshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 20 January 1941 for the prominent newspaper magnate William Berry, 1st Baron Camrose. He had previously received the award of Baronet, of Long Cross in the County of Surrey, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, on 4 July 1921, and was created Baron Camrose, of Long Cross in the County of Surrey, on 19 June 1929, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His second son, the third Viscount, disclaimed the peerages in 1995 on succeeding his elder brother. However, he had already been created a life peer as Baron Hartwell, of Peterborough Court in the City of London, on 19 January 1968. On his death in 2001 the life peerage became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his eldest son, the fourth Viscount. 
The first three Viscounts all headed &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; at one point, the first having purchased it from Harry Levy-Lawson, 1st Viscount Burnham, but in the 1980s they lost control to Conrad Black.

The first Viscount was the younger brother of the industrialist Seymour Berry, 1st Baron Buckland, and the elder brother of fellow press lord Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley.

In a March 2022 by-election, the 5th Viscount was elected to replace Lord Rotherwick in the House of Lords following Rotherwick&#x27;s retirement in February 2022.

<text>Rugby union, often simply referred to as rugby, is a full contact team sport which originated in England in the early 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. It is played with an oval-shaped ball on a field up to long and wide with H-shaped goal posts on each goal line.

<text>Fran Bošnjaković (1902–1993) was a noted Croatian thermodynamicist considered to be one of the pioneers in the development of technical thermodynamics.

Bošnjaković was born in Zagreb, where he was initially educated. He continued his education at the Technische Hochschule (Technical University) in Dresden, Germany. He obtained there a doctoral degree in engineering in 1928, and in 1931 he became a Privatdozent (university teacher) at the same Technical University.

When Hitler came into power, his further career in Germany was blocked, and he accepted in 1934 the position of an associate professor at the University of Belgrade. He moved back to the University of Zagreb as full professor in 1936. After 1945, during the Yugoslav communist regime, he was degraded to two years of forced labor. In 1951, he became rector of the University of Zagreb in Croatia, then part of Yugoslavia. However, continuing political disagreement with the communist régime in Yugoslavia made him decide to accept one of the research offers in post-war Germany.

In 1953, he started lecturing at the Technische Hochschule (Technical University) in Braunschweig in Germany, becoming the head of the Department for thermodynamics and director of the &quot;Thermotechnical institute&quot;. In 1961, he founded the &quot;Institute of Thermodynamics for Aeronautics and Astronautics&quot; at the university of Stuttgart, Germany, which he led until his retirement in 1968. There he established groups for &quot;Irreversible Thermodynamics&quot;, &quot;Mass Transfer and Thermokinetics&quot;, &quot;Radiation and Plasma&quot;, and &quot;Heat Transfer&quot;. After retirement, he spent several years as visiting professor at leading American universities.

His research covered a very wide area: problems of exergy, evaporation, binary and multi-component systems, heat and mass transfer, combustion and gasification, high temperature plasma, solar collectors and irreversibility of energy conversion in thermodynamic processes. With M. Jakob he laid down principles of nucleate bubble growth in superheated liquid.

His textbook &quot;Technische Thermodynamik&quot;, published in 1935 in Dresden, had seven improved and extended editions in Germany, and was translated into English (&quot;Technical Thermodynamics&quot;) and Russian (&quot;Tehnicheskaya termodinamika&quot;).

As one of world&#x27;s leading experts in thermodynamics, professor Bošnjaković was a member of Academies in Heidelberg and Venice, Braunschweig Society of Sciences and since 1991, a corresponding member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. He received a &quot;Grashof Commemorative Medal&quot; of the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure as well as Gold Medals of the Associazione Thermotechnica Italiana, and the Institut Français des combustibles et de l&#x27;énergie.

<text>Scripps College is a private liberal arts women&#x27;s college in Claremont, California. It was founded as a member of the Claremont Colleges in 1926, a year after the consortium&#x27;s formation. Journalist and philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps provided its initial endowment.

Scripps is a four-year undergraduate institution and enrolled 958 students . It offers instruction in the liberal arts with an emphasis on the humanities, and is known for its extensive interdisciplinary core curriculum. Its campus was designed by Gordon Kaufmann in the Spanish Colonial Revival style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Scripps is regarded as the premier women&#x27;s college in the West Coast of the United States. It is a top producer of Fulbright students. Its athletes compete on the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas joint team in the SCIAC, a Division III conference.

== History ==

=== Founding era ===
In November 1908, Ellen Browning Scripps, a philanthropist and prominent figure in the worlds of education, publishing, and women&#x27;s rights based in La Jolla, Calif., first visited Pomona College in Claremont for its Dedication Day. Scripps met many notable members of the young college, particularly James A. Blaisdell, the new president of Pomona College. Scripps continued to stay involved with Pomona College&#x27;s community and kept in touch with Blaisdell in the years following the event, funding some of the college&#x27;s lecture series.

Following an increase in enrollment of female students at Pomona College in 1919, Blaisdell turned to Scripps for the possibility of funding a &quot;Woman&#x27;s Campus.&quot; Scripps was willing to invest money into creating a college campus that would preserve her values of education. Over the next several years, she bought surrounding lots of land in Claremont and funded the construction of a new set of dormitories in what would become &quot;Scripps College for Women.&quot; According to Scripps, &quot;The paramount obligation of a college is to develop in its students the ability to think clearly and independently, and the ability to live confidently, courageously, and hopefully.&quot; To provide a liberal arts experience with both an all-women&#x27;s education and co-education, she wanted the college &quot;to stress the essentials, reduce the size of the curriculum instead of increasing it.&quot;

Scripps initially did not want the college to be named after her, but Blaisdell convinced her that her name would help grow and publicize the college.

The development of Scripps College marked the start of Claremont&#x27;s &quot;group-college&quot; system, similar to that of the Oxford Colleges, to which Scripps received much publicity. Scripps was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for establishing this new consortium of colleges, which became known as the Claremont Colleges.Scripps College was founded in 1926, following the coeducational Pomona College and Claremont Graduate University. Soon after, the first dormitory, created in 1927, was dedicated in memory of trustee Eleanor Joy Toll. Ernest J. Jaqua was inaugurated as the first president of Scripps College in the same dedication ceremony of Toll Hall. The second dormitory, established as a &quot;sister building&quot; to Toll Hall, was dedicated to Grace Scripps Clark, the niece of Ellen Browning Scripps and daughter of James E. Scripps, in November 1928. Balch Academic Hall and Browning Residence Hall, named for trustee Janet Jacks Balch and founder Ellen Browning Scripps, respectively, were dedicated in a joint ceremony in September 1929. Despite being designed by different architects, both halls adopted a &quot;&#x27;Mediterranean&#x27; motif&quot; unique to the campus.

At the age of 89, Scripps founded the college as one of the first institutions in the West dedicated to educating women for both professional careers and personal growth. Scripps&#x27;s &quot;experiment in education&quot; called for a setting with an artistic connection between buildings and garden landscape on an intimate scale.

=== Postwar era ===
Over time, the college has moved away from its finishing school–esque origins.

In 1968, students occupied a grove of olive trees to save them from being cut down to make space for construction of the humanities building.

=== 21st century ===

In 2000, the college opened a centralized dining facility, Malott Commons, ending the practice of serving meals in the residence halls.

In 2014, the college began admitting transgender women.

== Campus ==
Scripps College is frequently described as one of America&#x27;s most beautiful college campuses and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1984. In its 2017 edition of The Best 379 Colleges, the Princeton Review cited the campus as the twelfth most beautiful in the United States, and has been corroborated by Forbes, U.S. News &amp; World Report, The Huffington Post, and others.

Scripps College was the first recipient of the Getty Campus Heritage Initiative Program, which documented different aspects of the college that were deemed historically significant and at risk of change. The original historic precinct was recorded and the history of each site (such as residence hall or garden) was given, an original appearance was described, and a recording of changes over time was taken. Different courtyards on site, such as the Sicilian Court, Iris Court, and Margaret Fowler Garden were surveyed and adjusted to resemble their initial designs wherever possible.
Scripps is located in the center of the Claremont Colleges, surrounded by Harvey Mudd College to the north, Pitzer College to the east, Claremont McKenna College and Pomona College to the south, and Claremont Graduate University to the west. The original campus was designed by Gordon Kaufmann in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, featuring extensive use of domestic spaces that catered to a 1920s conception of femininity. In general, his 1926 campus plan has been carefully preserved, with major vistas linking the central areas. The overall planting schemes and landscaping devised by Edward Huntsman-Trout are still followed.

The campus also offers a number of interactive landscaping elements, including a rose garden to the north designated for community cutting and fruit trees available for picking. Oranges, grapefruits, pomegranates, kumquats, and loquats are available to students. Scripps also harvests olives from its olive trees and presses it into award-winning olive oil.

Several facilities are shared by the members of the Claremont Consortium. Scripps shares the Keck Science Center with Pitzer College. The consortium also owns the Robert J. Bernard Field Station north of Foothill Boulevard.

=== Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery ===
Scripps College is also the home of the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery, which maintains Scripps College&#x27;s permanent art collection of some 14,000 objects spanning 3,000 years of art history. Objects are available for use in classes, displayed in campus exhibitions, and loaned to other exhibiting institutions. Among the holdings in the collection are works by American artists Andy Warhol, Ansel Adams, Winslow Homer, Mary Cassatt, Childe Hassam, and John James Audubon, and an extensive collection of paintings by the California artist and Scripps Professor Emeritus Millard Sheets. The gallery also holds an extensive collection of Japanese woodblock prints.

=== Margaret Fowler Garden ===

Originally designed as a European medieval-style cloister garden to be located east of a proposed (but never built) chapel, the Margaret Fowler Garden is a walled garden located on the Scripps College Campus. The garden is laid out in two distinct sections: the western area contains a sculpture by Albert Stewart called &quot;Eternal Primitive&quot;. The western area of the garden also contains a central pool and four walkways extending in the cardinal directions. The eastern end has a Mediterranean style tiled wall fountain and open flagstone area. Arcades run along the north and south sides of the garden.

On the south wall of the Margaret Fowler Garden are murals by Alfredo Ramos Martínez. The college commissioned Martinez in 1945 to paint a mural (entitled &quot;The Flower Vendors&quot; on the south wall of the Fowler garden. Martínez sketched in the entire composition on the plaster wall and began working on several panels before dying unexpectedly on November 8, 1946, at the age of 72, leaving the mural unfinished. In 1994, a grant from the Getty Endowment allowed the mural to be conserved.

=== Environmental sustainability ===
Scripps College has several sustainability initiatives underway, from energy conservation to green building practices. On the conservation front, the college has seen monetary and energy savings through use of a new energy management system, and has designed water systems to cut down on waste. Turning &quot;Alumnae Field&quot; into a natural surface also helped in efforts to conserve water. Scripps has also downsized trash bins and made &quot;to-go&quot; containers recyclable, in order to divert more waste from landfills. On the emissions reductions front, maintenance staff use electric blowers and carts (as opposed to gas powered equipment), while a ride-sharing program is available for students, faculty and staff.

For its practices regarding sustainability, Scripps earned a B− on the College Sustainability Report Card 2011, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. This grade reflects a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the institution&#x27;s policies. The college received positive recognition for student involvement, on-campus transportation, its food and recycling programs, water programs, and LEED buildings, but fared poorly on the shareholder involvement evaluation category of the report.

== Organization and administration ==

Scripps is governed as a nonprofit organization by a board of trustees responsible for overseeing the long-term interests of the college.

The college has an endowment of $478 million as of November 2023.

The motto of the college is &quot;Incipit Vita Nova&quot; (&quot;Here Begins New Life&quot;) from Dante&#x27;s &quot;New Life&quot;.

== Academics ==

Scripps is a member of the Claremont Colleges, and much of student life revolves around the five colleges, or &quot;5Cs.&quot; Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, Pitzer College, and Harvey Mudd College not only interact socially, but also share dining halls, libraries, and other facilities spread throughout the bordering campuses. All five colleges, along with Claremont Graduate University and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, are part of the Claremont University Consortium.

Scripps students can cross-register for classes at or enroll in the majors of any of the undergraduate schools at The Claremont Colleges. Classes average 16 students, with an overall student-to-teacher ratio of 10:1. More than 21% choose to double or dual major by the time they graduate. All courses are taught by faculty.

Academics are focused on interdisciplinary humanities, combined with rigorous training in the disciplines. General requirements include classes in mathematics, fine arts, letters, natural sciences, social sciences, foreign language, women&#x27;s/gender studies, and race/ethnic studies. Scripps also requires first-year students to take a writing course in their first semester. Each graduating student must complete a senior thesis or project. Its most popular majors, by number out of 227 graduates in 2022, were:
*Political Science and Government (23)
*Research and Experimental Psychology (18)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (17)
*English Language and Literature (15)
*Environmental Science (15)
*Neuroscience (13)
*Mass Communication/Media Studies (13)
*Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (12)

A key part of the Scripps experience is the Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Studies, a sequence of three classes that encourage students to think critically and challenge ideas. Every first-year student takes Core I in the fall, which introduces students to major ideas. Core II seminars focus on specific ideas introduced in Core I. The seminars are usually team-taught by two professors from different fields, such as physics and art. The concluding Core III classes culminate in individual projects that often lead to students&#x27; senior thesis or project.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
Scripps is regarded as the premier women&#x27;s college in the American West.

The 2025 annual ranking by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Scripps as &#x27;more selective&#x27;, and ranks it 44th best liberal arts college in the nation, 80th for &quot;Best Value, tied for 144th in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;, and the fifth best women&#x27;s college after Wellesley College, Smith College, Bryn Mawr College and Mount Holyoke College. &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2019 rated it 60th in its &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; ranking of 650 schools, which include military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Scripps at 39th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Scripps 116th in 2020 among 218 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

=== Admissions ===
For the Class of 2023 (enrolling fall 2019), Scripps accepted 967 of the 3,022 applicants (32.0%).

Scripps College does not require the SAT or ACT exams for students applying for admission. For the Class of 2023, of the 62.2% of enrolled freshmen submitting SAT scores the middle 50% range was 673-740 for evidence-based reading and writing, 660-750 for math, while the ACT Composite middle 50% range was 30-33 for the 50.9% who submitted scores. The average high school GPA of incoming freshmen was 4.20.

=== Study abroad ===
Scripps College also maintains a robust study abroad program. The program, which more than 60% of students take advantage of, offers access to more than 120 approved programs in 86 cities in 47 countries (including domestic exchanges with Spelman College and George Washington University and internships in Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.).

== Student life ==

The Scripps student body consists of 1109 students as of 2019. Roughly half of students are white, and nearly all are female. The median family income of Scripps students is $160,700, with 49% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 15% from the bottom 60%.

=== Residential life ===

Scripps is a residential campus, with nine halls and on-campus apartments providing living arrangements for all four years of undergraduate study. In 2017, The Princeton Review included Scripps in several of their rankings, such as &quot;Best College Dorms&quot; (#5), &quot;Most Beautiful Campus&quot; (#12), and &quot;Best Campus Food&quot; (#13).

All residence halls are mixed-class halls; first-year students, sophomores, juniors, and seniors live in one shared community. The number of residents in each hall ranges from 70 to 120.

In October 2014, an anonymous donor gifted Scripps College with $10 million to support the construction of a tenth residence hall named Nan Elizabeth Walsh Schow Hall.

=== Student organizations ===

There are a number of registered clubs and organizations (abbreviated CLORGs) at Scripps. Scripps students also frequently participate in 5C clubs alongside students from the other Claremont Colleges. In total, there are nearly 300 clubs and organizations across the 5Cs.

A student-run feminist coffeehouse known as The Motley is a popular hangout spot and focal point for social life at the college.



==Athletics==

Scripps varsity athletes compete alongside athletes from Claremont McKenna College and Harvey Mudd College (other consortium members) as the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas. The teams participate in NCAA Division III in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

===Athletics history===
According to the Division III Fall Learfield Director&#x27;s Cup Standings for the 2023-2024 year, CMS ranks 19th among all Division III programs, and first among SCIAC colleges. In 2016-2017, the CMS golf team ranked first among NCAA Division III teams according to Golf Digest, and 17th overall (including Division 1 schools). The rankings are based on the &quot;Balanced&quot; category which is &quot;for students who place equal emphasis on school and sports&quot;.

===Sports===

Female Scripps athletes compete on the 11 CMS women&#x27;s teams:

*Basketball
*Cross Country
*Golf
*Lacrosse
*Soccer
*Softball
*Swimming and Diving
*Tennis

<doc id="472164" wikidata="Q7335984" url="?curid=472164" title="Riseball">
<text>In fastpitch softball, a rise ball is type of pitch that is thrown on an upward trajectory and with backspin in order to impart a rising motion. Two factors are primarily responsible for the effectiveness of the rise ball – movement and velocity. Pitchers rely on the movement of the rise ball to fool batters into swinging at pitches that appear to be in the strike zone but move up to and out of the upper part of the strike zone where they are more difficult to hit. Additionally the rise ball may be used in the lower strike zone to induce a batter to not swing at a pitch that they believe will drop out of the strike zone, but in fact travels through the zone causing the hitter to take a strike without swinging. Rise balls are high velocity pitches, generally thrown at speeds that match or are close to the pitcher’s fastball speed. At the women’s collegiate level, rise balls typically are thrown in a range of 60 to 70mph with the most dominant pitchers capable of speeds in excess of 70mph. 

Although the rise ball has been popularized by Jennie Finch, who famously used it (among other pitches) to strike out some Major League Baseball players including Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds, most effective softball pitchers use the rise ball in combination with other pitches. Monica Abbott and Cat Osterman, are widely considered to be among the most dominant pitchers ever to use the rise ball as part of their pitching approach.

== Disputing the “Rise” ==

There is some debate regarding the degree to which a rise ball actually “rises”.
It is a popular belief among players, coaches and observers that the rise ball exhibits an increasing upward trajectory during its flight – if viewed in 2 dimensions, from the side, the flight path of the ball is a convex curve with respect to the origin. Popular lore goes even further, suggesting that the flight of the ball exhibits one or more abrupt changes of direction or “hops” as the ball gets close to the plate. Alternatively, some observers believe that the appearance of rise is a visual illusion created by the tendency of the rise ball to be thrown on an upward trajectory from a low release point and that the flight path of the ball is one of decreasing upward trajectory (i.e., the ball crosses the plate at a higher point that released, but its arc is concave with respect to the origin). 

The key element in the debate is whether the force created by the spin of the ball, known as the Magnus Effect, is great enough to offset the effect of the other net forces exerted on the ball such that the ball follows and increasingly upward trajectory for some part of its flight path. 

== Scholarly work ==

A student-led observational study in Applied Physics conducted at Armstrong Atlantic State University used still images taken from video of rise balls thrown from both a pitching machine and a human pitcher to document the flight path of the ball. One image appears to show that the ball follows an increasingly upward trajectory; however, this image was taken of a particular type of training ball known as a JUGS LITE-FLITE ball, which has “one third of the mass (59.5g) of a regulation softball (181.71g)”. A similar image shown of a regulation softball pitched at the same speed (70mph) seems to show a decreasing upward trajectory, although the author describes the outcome nebulously as “the rise is not apparent”. A third image of a human pitcher shows a pitch at an upward trajectory, however it is difficult to assess the arc of the ball’s movement as the camera is set at an oblique angle from behind and graphics are overlaid on the photo such that the actual ball cannot be seen. It is unclear why, if the ball can be seen on an increasingly upward trajectory, the author would cover the actual image of the ball with a graphic indication of the ball. This particular study does not provide any information of the rate or angle of the spin imparted on the ball in either approach. In the conclusion, the author writes that they “believe” with better video equipment and pitching machine, it can be proven that a rise ball actually rises. 

Another study utilizes a theoretical physics approach to modelling the trajectories of various softball pitches, including the rise ball. The authors consider the effects of gravity, drag and the Magnus Effect using Newton’s laws of motion to calculate the position of the ball at different points in time, allowing them to model the trajectory of the ball in 3 dimensions. Several examples of lift coefficient and launch angle are given and two-dimensional trajectories are graphed for two example pitches. For a pitch with an initial launch angle of 3-degrees upward, the trajectory is concave – decreasing positive trajectory in the “rising” phase and increasingly negative trajectory in the latter phase. The study concludes that, assuming average observed values for lift coefficient, a 65mph rise ball must have at least a three degree launch angle in order to pass the strike zone at a point higher than the release point (the bottom of the strike zone and release point are the same at 1.5 feet). This research suggests that, under general conditions, the Magnus Effect is not great enough on its own to overcome the other net forces. The net change in the pitch elevation is primarily conditional on the launch angle of the pitch – at higher angles, the pitch will cross the plate higher than the release point. The trajectory of the pitch will still be decreasing (i.e., either traveling in a decreasingly upward path, or an increasingly downward path). The paper does not present modeled paths for rise balls using significantly higher assumptions for lift coefficient, thus it is still an open question if a human pitcher can exert enough spin, to create a high enough Magnus Effect to create a true rise.

<text>Viscount Scarsdale, of Scarsdale in Derbyshire, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the prominent Conservative politician and former Viceroy of India George Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston, who was created Earl Curzon of Kedleston at the same time and was later made Marquess Curzon of Kedleston.

==History==
The first member of the Curzon family to hold a hereditary title was John Curzon, who was created a baronet, of Kedleston in the County of Derby, in both the Baronetage of Nova Scotia (18 June 1636) and the Baronetage of England (11 August 1641). His grandson, the third Baronet, sat as a Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. His younger brother, the fourth Baronet, represented Derby, Clitheroe and Derbyshire in the House of Commons. His eldest son, the fifth Baronet, also sat as a member of parliament for Clitheroe and Derbyshire. In 1761 he was created Baron Scarsdale, of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Scarsdale later served as Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords. His son, the second Baron, represented Derbyshire in the House of Commons. His grandson, the fourth Baron, was Rector of Kedleston for sixty years.

The latter&#x27;s eldest son George Curzon was a distinguished Conservative politician. On his appointment as Viceroy of India in 1898 he was created Baron Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of Ireland, to enable him to potentially return to the House of Commons (as Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords). In the event he never returned to the House of Commons and following his return from India was elected an Irish representative peer in 1908. The barony of Curzon of Kedleston was the last title created in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1911 Curzon was made (1) Baron Ravensdale, of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, with remainder in default of male issue to his eldest daughter and the heirs of her body, failing whom to his other daughters in like manner in order of primogeniture, (2) Viscount Scarsdale, of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, with remainder in default of male issue to his father and the male heirs of his body, and (3) Earl Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. All these titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1916 he also succeeded his father in the barony of Scarsdale. In 1921, he was further honoured when he was created Earl of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, and Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, with remainder to the male heirs of his body. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Lord Curzon had no sons, and on his death the barony of Curzon of Kedleston, the earldoms of Curzon of Kedleston and of Kedleston and the marquessate became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of Ravensdale according to the special remainder by his daughter Irene. The viscountcy of Scarsdale passed according to the special remainder to his nephew, Richard Curzon, the second Viscount, who also succeeded as sixth Baron Scarsdale and as tenth Baronet. On the second Viscount&#x27;s death the titles passed to his first cousin, the third Viscount. He was the son of Francis Nathaniel Curzon, third son of the fourth Baron. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Viscount Scarsdale, who succeeded his father in 2000.

Assheton Curzon, second son of the fourth Curzon baronet, was created Viscount Curzon in 1802 and is the ancestor of the Earls Howe (see this title for more information).

As of 31 January 2018 the present baronet has not successfully proved his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2000.

The family seat is Kedleston Hall, near Kedleston, Derbyshire.

<doc id="472172" wikidata="Q2528244" url="?curid=472172" title="Viscount St Davids">
<text>Viscount St Davids, of Lydstep Haven in the County of Pembroke, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1918 for John Philipps, 1st Baron St Davids. The Philipps family descends from Sir John Philipps (died 27 March 1629), who represented Pembrokeshire in the House of Commons. In 1621 he was created a Baronet, of Picton Castle in the County of Pembroke, in the Baronetage of England. His grandson, the third Baronet, also sat as Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet. He represented Pembroke and Haverfordwest in Parliament. His son, the fifth Baronet, sat for Haverfordwest. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Baronet. He represented Carmarthen, Petersfield and Pembrokeshire in the House of Commons.

His son, the seventh Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire and Haverfordwest and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Haverfordwest and of Pembrokeshire. In 1776 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Milford. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1823. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his distant relative, the eighth Baronet. He was a descendant of Hugh Philipps, third son of the first Baronet. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Baronet. This line of the family failed on the death of the latter&#x27;s son, the tenth Baronet, in 1857.

The late Baronet was succeeded by his kinsman, the eleventh Baronet. His son, the twelfth Baronet, was a clergyman and served as Vicar of Warminster from 1859 to 1897 and as Canon of Salisbury. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the thirteenth Baronet. He sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Mid Lanarkshire and Pembrokeshire. In 1908, four years before he succeeded his father in the baronetcy, he was created Baron St Davids, of Roch Castle in the County of Pembroke, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1918 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount St Davids, of Lydstep Haven in the County of Pembroke, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord St Davids married as his second wife Elizabeth Frances Philipps, 14th Baroness Strange, 15th Baroness Hungerford and 14th Baroness de Moleyns (1884–1974) (see the Baron Strange, Baron Hungerford and Baron de Moleyns for earlier history of these titles). The Viscount&#x27;s two sons from his first marriage were both killed in action in the First World War.

He was succeeded therefore by his son from his second marriage, Iestyn, who became the second Viscount. In 1974, he also succeeded his mother as Baron Strange, Baron Hungerford and Baron De Moleyns. His son, Colwyn Philipps, 3rd Viscount St Davids, who succeeded in 1991, held office from 1992 to 1994 in the Conservative administration of John Major and was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords from 1995 to 1999. However, Lord St Davids lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the titles are held by his eldest son Rhodri Philipps, the fourth Viscount, who succeeded in 2009.

Two of the first Viscount&#x27;s younger brothers, Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant, and Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford, were also raised to the peerage.

The first bearer of the surname was Sir Thomas Philipps (died 1520), of Clisant, Llanwinio, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He was the son of Philip ap Maredudd. He was a patrilineal descendant of Sir Aron ap Rhys, a Welsh knight who accompanied Richard I on the Crusades in 1190.

<text>Nicopolis () or Actia Nicopolis was the capital city of the Roman province of Epirus Vetus. It is located near Preveza, Greece. The city was founded in 29 BC by Octavian in commemoration of his victory in 31 BC over Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium nearby.

Many impressive ruins of the ancient city may be visited today.

==History==

===Foundation===

In 29 BC, 2 years after his victory in the naval battle of Actium, Octavian founded a new city which he called Nicopolis (the City of Victory), located on the southernmost promontory of Epirus, and across the mouth of the harbour from the ancient town of Actium. This foundation echoed a tradition dating back to Alexander the Great, and more recently illustrated by Pompey, founder of Nicopolis in Little Armenia (63 BC). Symbolically, the new city represented one example of his successful unification of the Roman Empire under one administration. Geographically, it constituted a major transportation and communications link between the eastern and western halves of the Mediterranean. Economically, it served to reorganise and revitalise the region, which had never recovered from its destruction by Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus in the Third Macedonian War (171–167 BC), or the further destruction under Sulla in 87–86 BC. It also established an important commercial centre and port at this strategic position on the Mediterranean sea routes.

On a hill north of Nicopolis where his own tent had been pitched, and north of the present village of Smyrtoula, Octavian also built a monument and sanctuary to Apollo, considered his patron god, and trophies to two other gods, Neptune and Mars for their contribution to its victory. This monument was adorned with the rams of captured galleys. In further celebration of his victory he instituted the quadrennial Actian games in honour of Apollo Actius.

In 27 BC, Octavian implemented an Empire-wide administrative reform. The new &quot;polis&quot; was considered capital of the territories of southern Epirus including Ambracia, most of Akarnania, and western Aetolia. Many inhabitants of the surrounding areas – Kassopaia, Ambracia, parts of Acarnania (including Leukas, Palairos, Amphilochian Argos, Calydon, and Lysimachia) and western Aetolia – were forced to relocate to the new city. Among other things, it obtained the right to send five representatives to the Amphictyonic Council. As a city in a senatorial province, Nicopolis began minting its own copper coins (until 268).

During the first five years or so of the city&#x27;s foundation, local authorities supervised the construction of the city walls, the majority of the public buildings, including the theatre, stadium, gymnasium, odeion, and the aqueduct. The city&#x27;s western gate was connected by a road to the Ionian harbour Komaros. The city eventually occupied a site of around 375 acres.

Although the exact legal status of Nicopolis is the subject of some dispute, unlike other Roman foundations in Greece contemporary with Nicopolis such as Patras, Philippi and, also in Epirus, Buthrotum and Epidamnus, the city was not, or was not only, a Roman colony (implying that Roman military veterans also settled there) but also a free city (&quot;civitas libera Nicopolitana&quot;) i.e. a polis (Greek city), free and autonomous, having the characteristics of &quot;civitas libera&quot; and &quot;civitas foederata&quot;, linked to Rome by a treaty (&quot;foedus&quot;).

===1st century===

Thus provided with considerable assets by its founder, the new city developed rapidly in Roman times; Augustus adorned it with monuments financed by the spoils of war, but it also owes much to the patronage of Herod the Great. The two ports, one on the Amvrakikos Gulf, probably Vathy, and one at Komaros on the Ionian Sea (Fig. 4), ensured the commercial development of the city which was built on the Roman orthogonal grid distinguished by its considerable size (about 180 ha).

Germanicus, nephew and adopted son of Augustus, visited the city en route to Syria and celebrated his second consulship there in 18 AD. In 30–31, the Roman consul Poppaeus Sabinus visited Nicopolis.

In the winter of 65–66, the Apostle Paul decided to spend the winter at Nicopolis and in his Epistle to Titus 3:12 invited his co-worker Titus to join him there from Crete. Apparently a Christian community was in existence in the city.

In 66, in the wake of a terror campaign and financial constraints in Rome, Emperor Nero made a more modest trip to Greece in lieu of a planned great journey to the east. He visited Nicopolis during his tour of Greece to take part in the Actian games and was crowned winner of the chariot race, as is indicated on coins minted in Nicopolis in his honor.

Around 94, Emperor Domitian expelled philosophers from Rome including the prominent Stoic philosopher Epictetus of Hierapolis, who went to Nicopolis. He founded his own school, and in the reign of Trajan counted Arrian among his students, thanks to the notes he made of his philosophy. He died there around AD 135.

===2nd century===
Around 110, under Emperor Trajan, the Roman government carved out parts of Macedonia and Achaia to make a separate province of Epirus. It had been decided that the territory needed a stricter government to yield higher revenues. The new province included Acarnania to the south as far as the Achelous, but not Apollonia to the north, plus the Ionian Islands – Corfu, Leukas, Ithaca, Cephalonia, and Zacynthus. It was governed by a &quot;procurator Augusti&quot; headquartered at Nicopolis, together with other special &quot;procuratores&quot;, including a &quot;procurator&quot; of the purple fisheries, whose sphere of office, however, extended to Achaea and Thessaly. This administrative set up appears to have remained intact through the reforms of Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) and up until Emperor Diocletian (284–305).

In 128, Emperor Hadrian visited Nicopolis with his wife Sabina during his second voyage to the East (128–134). The imperial couple were received with the highest honours: small altars in the city attest to the worship of Hadrian and Sabina, respectively assimilated to Zeus Dodonaios, the most important deity of Epirus, and Artemis Kelkaia, a manifestation of the goddess unknown outside Nicopolis. Hadrian took advantage of his stay to build a temple to his late protégé, Antinous.

Around this time the city&#x27;s western gate was constructed, several hundred metres north of the south gate, becoming the main gate of Nicopolis.

Around 180, the next mention of Nicopolis in Church history concerns a bishop of Rome, Pope Eleutherius, who reigned from around 174–189. He was born in Nicopolis, according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, and served as a deacon in Rome. During his term in office as Bishop of Rome, the Church was involved in the Montanist controversy.

Around 193–198, Emperor Septimius Severus, based in Syria, campaigned in Mesopotamia, with indirect consequences for Achaea and Epirus: to help pay for these campaigns, Severus apparently required several cities to mint special coins, including Nicopolis, Patrae, Epidaurus, Apollonia, Thuria, Plautilla, and the Thessalian &quot;koinon&quot;.


===Later Roman and Byzantine period===
The late third century was a time of troubles for the whole Empire: the city was attacked by the Goths and Heruli, but managed to avoid looting thanks to makeshift fortifications.

In 268, the Goths launched a combined land-sea invasion against the Roman Empire, assisted by Heruli sailors and other tribesmen. Their naval forces ravaged Byzantium and Chrysopolis, though the imperial fleet successfully counter-attacked on the Propontis. Meanwhile, the land forces overran Thrace and continued into Achaea as far south as Sparta; the invading Goths and Heruli sacked Athens, crossed the isthmus, sacked and burned the lower part of Corinth, and advanced to Argos and Sparta, ravaging the countryside along the way and burning the two cities. Here imperial land and sea forces counter-attacked, and the invaders wandered their way through Boeotia, Acarnania, Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace on their way back to Moesia.

In Epirus, while the inhabitants of Nicopolis made hasty repairs to fortifications and managed to avert the danger, the leaders of Corfu organised their own army, crossed over into Epirus and defeated the Goths on land.

The Roman army chased the Goths and their allies and defeated them at Naissus. It seems that the city then lost much of its importance and reputation by becoming only a provincial centre. 
In 293, as part of Diocletian&#x27;s reforms, the province of Epirus became known as &quot;Epirus Vetus&quot; (including Adrianopolis, Phoenice, Onchesmos, and Buthrotum as the most northerly major cities, and Acarnania and the islands of Corfu, Ithaca, and probably Leucas to the south). The capital was Nicopolis.

Meanwhile, the territory of northern Epirus (including, Apollonia, Byllis and Amantia on its southern borders) became known as &quot;Epirus Nova&quot;, with the capital at Dyrrachium. Both provinces, along with Macedonia, Thessaly and Achaea, were included in the diocese of Moesia, which also included four provinces in the northwestern Balkans. The islands of Cephalonia, Zacynthus, and Cythera were included in the province of Achaea.

Both Epirus Vetus and Epirus Nova were governed by a &quot;praeses&quot;.

Writing around 300, one Arnobius of Numidia mentioned the existence of Christian communities in Achaea, Macedonia, and Epirus.

In about 330, the first great recorded Church historian Eusebius of Caesarea mentions that bishops from Epirus attended the first Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in 325. This implies that bishoprics and an episcopal administrative system had been set up some time before 325. Until the time of Constantine, it is supposed that the bishopric of Nicopolis came under the jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Corinth, but with the administrative reforms under Emperor Diocletian and Constantine (306–337), Nicopolis itself became the metropolitan city of Epirus Vetus. Eusebius also mentions that Origen of Alexandria went to Nicopolis in the first half of the third century and discovered a rare Greek translation of the Old Testament.

In 327, Emperor Constantine split the diocese of Moesia into Dacia and Macedonia. The two provinces of Epirus, along with the provinces of Macedonia, Thessaly, and Achaia, became part of the diocese of Macedonia (capital Thessalonica).

In 343, in the Acts of the Council of Sardica, we have the first mention by name of a bishop of Nicopolis, one Isidoros.

In 361, newly appointed Consul and rhetorician Claudius Mamertinus delivered a panegyric to the young Emperor Julian (360–363), mentioning heavy taxation in Dalmatia and Epirus. He emphasised the destruction of some of the most important monuments while congratulating the Emperor for his restoration work.

===Christian Nicopolis===

Based on the record of Julian&#x27;s close ties with certain leading men from Epirus involved in the Empire-wide cultural circuit led by Libanius and Themistius, it appears that Christianity was not widespread in Epirus in the mid-4th century (and as part of his pagan policy, Julian reactivated support of the Actian games), but after his death it spread far and wide in the region, judging from legislation issued by Valentinian in 371 and 372, trying to offset some negative effects of its rapid spread, and the fact that there is no written record of the bishops of the cities of Epirus until the 5th century, except for the bishop of Nicopolis in 343.

The Acts of the Council of Constantinople in 381, as well as of the Third (431) and Fourth (451) Ecumenical Councils, recognized the see of Thessalonica as holding sixth place in the Church administrative hierarchy, after the five patriarchs. Among the sees of Illyricum, Thessalonica held the first position in the hierarchy, followed by Corinth and Nicopolis.

In 431, the Acts of the Third Ecumenical Council at Ephesus list the bishops of Epirus, including metropolitan Bishop Donatus of Nicopolis (c. 425–432).

Atticus Bishop of Nicopolis was an attendee at Council of Chalcedon.

The majority of the bishops from Epirus and Illyricum and other representatives upheld the Orthodox theological position of the Bishop Celestine I of Rome (422–432) and Bishop Cyril of Alexandria against the Patriarch of Constantinople Nestorius. During this time, Bishop Donatus of Nicopolis maintained a correspondence with Bishop Cyril of Alexandria concerning Nestorianism.

In 451, six Epirote bishops attended the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon, including Bishop Atticus of Nicopolis. All these bishops without exception signed the Council&#x27;s decisions in favor of the Orthodox position of Dyophysitism, also backed by the bishop of Rome.

In 457-458 the bishops of Epirus then held a provincial synod to ratify the validity of the Fourth Ecumenical Council. We have a list of as many as nine bishops signing a letter written by Bishop Eugenius of Nicopolis to Pope Leo I of Rome.

This was also the time of Bishop Diadochos of Photiki (c. 450–458), a saint and Father of the Church. Not only was he the bishop of what was the capital of a wider district called Thesprotia, he was also the author of important theological treatises, three of which are extant.

In combination with the notice of the correspondence between the bishop of Nicopolis and the bishop of Alexandria mentioned previously, from the writings of Diadochos we can infer that learned texts, along with amphorae, traveled between the eastern Mediterranean and Epirus in the 5th century.

Diadochos’ texts also show us that both theoretical and practical ideas about theology and the organization of monastic life also spread from the eastern Mediterranean to Epirus. In fact, a reference in one of Diadochos’ own writings suggests he was also the hegumen of a monastery in Photiki and that Epirus in the 450s at least had both anchoretic and coenobitic monastic communities.

From around 460, a series of six basilicas were built, beginning with the five-aisled metropolitan basilica B. Artisans decorated many of the basilicas with high-quality mosaics, developing their own workshop, and operating until the 550s. Their influence extended to the rest of Epirus and perhaps further afield in eastern Illyricum.

Basilica B was the largest of the Nicopolis basilicas and probably served as the metropolitan bishop&#x27;s main church. An inscription informs us that Bishop Alcison (491-516) sponsored some additions to the southern annex of Basilica B, possibly around 500.

In 474, Emperor Zeno initiated peace negotiations with the Vandals. But during the negotiations, in order to strengthen their position, the Vandals again devastated the coast of Greece during which they captured Nicopolis and took prisoners who had to be ransomed to secure their release.

Evidently the walls of Nicopolis built in the time of Augustus were not for defensive purposes, or at least were not functioning in 474, since the Vandals took the city apparently without being equipped with siege tools, while they failed to take the walled city of Taenarum. If this is so, the walls of Nicopolis attributed to Justinian, enclosing only one-sixth of the city founded by Augustus, were erected not before 474. In any case, the Nicopolis walls, probably of the 480s-510s period (like those of Dyrrachium), were made of bricks, mortar, and rubble.

This raid and prisoner-taking probably had a devastating effect on the infrastructure of Nicopolis and the mentality of its citizens, affecting the city&#x27;s social and economic life. It is probably directly related to the reduction of the city&#x27;s population to one-sixth of what it had been, confining it to the north-east section, the area where the citadel stood, and fortifying it with thick walls to provide better defence.

Around 500, as mentioned, Bishop Alcison (491–516), an opponent of the Monophysite policy of Emperor Anastasius, supervised the addition of annexes to the five-aisled metropolitan basilica B, which has taken his name.

Around 515, the three-aisled basilica Δ, with fragments of floor mosaics, was built.

In 516, all eight bishops of Vetus Epirus held a synod and elected Ioannes as successor to the martyred Bishop Alcison. Bishop Ioannes sent a deacon, Rufinus, with a letter to Pope Hormisdas, reaffirming their steadfastness in the Orthodox faith. The synod appears to be the seventh local episcopal synod for Epirus Vetus.

In 551, King Totila of the Ostrogoths, in response to reports of a Byzantine military build-up in the eastern side of the Adriatic, sent a 300-strong fleet to Corfu. The Ostrogoths sacked it and nearby islands. They also sacked the area around Dodoni inland and Nicopolis, and captured several Byzantine ships on their way to bring supplies to Narses.

Around 555, according to Procopius, Emperor Justinian renovated the fortifications of Nicopolis, as part of his huge program involving the renewal of city fortifications and the erection of new defences.

Construction of the three-aisled Basilica Α, decorated with an extensive series of extant floor mosaics. was begun. Bishop Dumetius I also made some additions (the &quot;pastophoria&quot;) to Basilica B, and the three-aisled basilica Ε, near the southern harbor Magaronas, was built.

Around 575, the three-aisled basilica Γ was built and Basilica Α was completed under Bishop Dumetius II.

In 587, the Avars allied with Slavic tribes invaded Thrace, Macedonia and Achaua, including Thessaly, Attica, Euboia, and Peloponnesos, as well as Epirus Vetus, where the invasion seems to have reached as far as Euroea, but not Cassope and Nicopolis.

In 625, Pope Honorius I sent a letter to Metropolitan Hypatius of Nicopolis referring to the difficult travel conditions that prevented the bishop from reaching Rome.

===Middle Ages to present===
The province of Epirus Vetus, of which Nicopolis was the capital, was part of the western patriarchate as arranged by Justinian I and was directly subject to the jurisdiction of the pope; but, about 732, Leo the Isaurian made it subject to the patriarch of Constantinople because of the pope&#x27;s resistance to the emperor&#x27;s iconoclastic policy.

The last known bishop of Nicopolis was Anastasius, who attended the Ecumenical Council of 787. Soon afterwards, owing to the decadence into which Nicopolis fell, the metropolitan see was transferred to Naupactus, which subsequently figured as such in the &quot;Notitiae episcopatuum&quot;.

In the course of the Middle Ages Nicopolis was supplanted by the town of Preveza.

In 1798 French Revolutionary troops, stationed in Preveza by Napoleon, dug into the graves and ruins of ancient Nicopolis and looted various treasures. These were later taken by the troops of Ali Pasha, who defeated the French and their Greek allies.

Various battles fought in this area, the latest in 1912, when it was captured by the Greek army during the First Balkan War, have been named &quot;Battle of Nicopolis&quot; rather than &quot;Battle of Preveza&quot;.

==Archaeology==
The ruins of Nicopolis, now known as Palaea Preveza (&quot;Old Preveza&quot;), lie about 5 km north of the town, on a small bay of the Gulf of Arta (Sinus Ambracius) at the narrowest part of the isthmus of the peninsula which separates the Gulf from the Ionian Sea. The site was briefly excavated by John Papadimitriou in 1940. Besides the Acropolis, the most conspicuous features are:
* The Actium monument of Augustus
*a theatre ( with 77 rows of seats)
*an Odeon
*large sections of the original walls

*an aqueduct which brought water to the town from the Louros river over a distance of about 50 km./30 mi. The aqueduct bridge over the river downstream from the source is one of the very few remaining in Greece today. The water was finally brought to the Nymphaeum in the city which also contained a header tank from where it was further distributed. Remains of the aqueduct in several forms of construction are visible in the regions of Thesprotiko, Louros, Stefani-Oropos, Archangelos and Nicopolis. Recent research has assigned its construction to Hadrian&#x27;s rule, in the 2nd century AD. Ancient sources mention that in the 4th C AD the aqueduct needed several repairs which were undertaken by Emperor Julian. The Aqueduct ceased to operate in the mid 5th century.

*the nympheum or great fountain.
*the baths (thermae)
*the Roman villa of Antoninus with beautiful mosaic
*the stadium, was the location of the famous Actian Games, together with the nearby gymnasium, theatre and hippodrome. It was located in the so-called &#x27;Proasteion&#x27; (sacred grove) of Nicopolis. Dating from just after the city&#x27;s foundation, the stadium has two semicircular ends (sphendones), typical of the Roman amphitheatre type. The stadiums of ancient Laodicea (near Pamukkale, Turkey) and Aphrodisias (Geyre, Turkey) have a similar architecture. The north side of the stadium, which must have held a capacity of at least 10,000 spectators, was built on the side of a hill, while artificial deposits were used for the other sides. The walls were made of a rubble core faced with several courses of bricks. On the west side of the stadium were three apsidal entrances leading to the gymnasium, the central one larger than the others. The entrances in the sphendone at the east led to the theatre nearby. On the sphendone at the south side there were residential rooms and facilities for athletes and spectators (inns, shops, lodgings etc.)
The nearby Archaeological Museum of Nikopolis contains many exhibits.

<text>This is a list of United States Navy aircraft wings. The U.S. Navy first used the term &quot;wing&quot; to describe the level of command above its aircraft squadrons when in 1937 it established five Patrol Wings to exercise command of its non-ship based patrol squadrons. A year later it organized the squadrons flying from the five aircraft carriers in commission at the time into Carrier Air Groups. Those Carrier Air Groups which were established in 1938 are the forerunners of today&#x27;s Carrier Air Wings. Today the U.S. Navy operates both Aircraft Carrier based [[Carrier air wing|Carrier Air Wings]] and land based Functional Wings and Type Wings. Carrier Air Wings are operational units made up of squadrons of different types of aircraft that deploy aboard aircraft carriers. The Navy&#x27;s land based wings are organized either to perform a specific function (Functional Wings) or around a specific aircraft type (Type Wings). Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings, Test Wings and Training Wings are examples of functional wings, these wings may consist of a single type of aircraft or a variety of types needed to perform a wing&#x27;s specific function. Type Wings consist of squadrons of a single type of aircraft, they are non-deploying &quot;force providers&quot; that provide combat ready squadrons or detachments to deploying Carrier Air Wings or to other Navy or joint forces. All Navy aircraft wings whether they are Carrier Air Wings or Land Based Type or Functional Wings are commanded by a Navy Captain, however; in the case of a Training Air Wing or Naval Test Wing a U.S. Marine Corps Colonel is sometimes assigned as commander as those wings conduct training or test and evaluation for both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. Commanders of Carrier Air Wings are informally addressed as &quot;CAG&quot; which is a hold over from the previous designation (prior to 20 Dec 1963) of Carrier Air Wings as Carrier Air Groups and commanders of functional or type wings are addressed as &quot;Commodore&quot; which is a traditional Naval title for an officer exercising command over multiple units commanded by Commanding Officers (individual ships or aircraft squadrons)

==Current Navy Air Wings==
The Navy currently operates nine Carrier Air Wings and twenty three land based Type Wings and Functional Wings.

===Current Carrier Air Wings===
Carrier Air Wings were first established on 1 July 1938 when the aircraft squadrons assigned to the aircraft carriers USS Lexington (CV 2), USS Saratoga (CV 3), USS Ranger (CV 4), USS Yorktown (CV 5) and USS Enterprise (CV 6) were established as &quot;Carrier Air Groups&quot; assigned to each of those ships. Two of those Carrier Air Groups still exist today as Carrier Air Wings ONE and THREE. On 20 December 1963 all Carrier Air Groups which were then in existence were redesignated Carrier Air Wings (CVW). Of the nine current Carrier Air Wings, two were established before WWII, four during WWII, two during the period of the Korean War and one during period of the Vietnam War. The table below lists the nine currently active Carrier Air Wings.
: &quot;Tail codes with a first letter &quot;A&quot; denote Atlantic Fleet airwings, while &quot;N&quot; denotes Pacific Fleet airwings.&quot;

===Current land based wings===

The Navy&#x27;s land based aircraft wings either operate land based aircraft squadrons in various operational or support roles (Functional Wings) or they provide deployable combat ready squadrons or detachments to Carrier Air Wings or to other Navy or joint forces (Type Wings). The tables below list the Navy&#x27;s current ten Type Wings and thirteen Functional Wings (including three of the U.S. Navy Reserve).

&quot;Type and Functional Wings are generally not assigned Tail Codes. The exceptions are the Training Air Wings, the Navy Reserve&#x27;s Tactical Support Wing which retains the code &quot;AF&quot; from its former existence as Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY and Electronic Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet (VAQWINGPAC) which adopted the code &quot;NL&quot; from the disestablished CVW-15 for use by the wing&#x27;s land based &quot;expeditionary&quot; squadrons only. Squadrons which are assigned to Carrier Air Wings are marked with the tail code of that Carrier Air Wing. Squadrons which do not deploy as part of a Carrier Air Wing are all assigned tail codes unique to each squadron (except for the aforementioned expeditionary VAQ squadrons, training squadrons and the reserve&#x27;s Tactical Support Wing squadrons). See U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Aircraft Tail Codes.&quot;

==Disestablished Navy Air Wings==
The tables below list the Navy&#x27;s Carrier Air Wings and land based wings which have been disestablished. Included in the tables of disestablished wings are no longer used former designations of disestablished and current wings.

===Disestablished Carrier Air Groups/Carrier Air Wings 1938 to present===
On 1 July 1938 the first five Carrier Air Groups were established. They were the Lexington Air Group, the Saratoga Air Group, the Ranger Air Group, the Yorktown Air Group and the Enterprise Air Group (aircraft had operated from the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, USS Langley from January 1923 to June 1936 but in October 1936 she was converted into a seaplane tender and by that time no longer operated as an aircraft carrier). Between 1 July 1938 and the end of World War II approximately 88 more airwings were established. To the present day there have been a total of 133 Carrier Air Groups (called Carrier Air Wings since 20 December 1963) established, only nine of which still exist as Carrier Air Wings. A tenth wing still exists as the U.S. Navy Reserve&#x27;s Tactical Support Wing which is now a land based functional wing.

During the course of a single Carrier Air Group/Carrier Air Wing&#x27;s existence it may have been identified by more than one designation. The inverse is also true in that a single designation (such as CVG-15) could have been used for multiple different Carrier Air Groups/Carrier Air Wings over time. For example, there were three carrier air groups which were designated CVG-15 at some point in each of their existence and none of those three groups were related to each other. The first was a Second World War group which existed as CVG-15 from 1 September 1942 to 30 October 1945. The second was a Carrier Air Group which was established in 1945 as CVG-153, it was redesignated CVAG-15 on 15 November 1946, then again redesignated as CVG-15 on 1 September 1948 and disestablished on 1 December 1949. The third was established as CVG-15 on 5 April 1951, redesignated CVW-15 on 20 December 1963 and disestablished on 31 March 1995. The lineage of a Carrier Air Group/Carrier Air Wing does not follow the designation, it follows the Group/Wing regardless of the designation.

Of the 133 Carrier Air Groups/Carrier Air Wings which have ever existed, 100 have been identified by a single designation, 17 have been identified by two designations, seven by three designations, six by four designations and three by five designations.

This section contains tables of disestablished Carrier Air Groups (Ship Named Groups, CVG, CVLG, CVEG, CVBG, CVAG, CVSG), Air Task Groups (ATG) and Carrier Air Wings (CVW). The tables which follow are arranged by time periods using the designation scheme which was in use during that time period. Because of this, various carrier air groups/carrier air wings will appear in multiple tables below. 

====Ship named Carrier Air Groups 1938 to 1943====
Aircraft squadrons operating from the Navy&#x27;s first Aircraft Carriers prior to WWII were assigned to that aircraft carrier and were organizationally grouped into that carrier&#x27;s &quot;air group&quot;. On 1 July 1938 the &quot;Carrier Air Group&quot; was formally established as a separate unit and the previously informally named air groups were titled &quot;&quot;name of ship&quot; Air Group&quot;. Air Groups were permanently assigned to a specific Aircraft Carrier and carried that Aircraft Carrier&#x27;s name (Lexington Air Group, Saratoga Air Group etc...)

====Carrier Air Groups 1 March 1942 to 15 November 1946====
In 1942 in anticipation of the coming massive build up of aircraft carriers and carrier air groups a new Carrier Air Group designation scheme was created which divorced carrier air group names from specific aircraft carriers. Instead, air groups were given the designation &quot;CVG&quot; meaning &quot;Carrier Air Group&quot; followed by a number. All newly establishing carrier air groups were designated under this system. The first Carrier Air Group designated using this scheme was CVG-9 on 1 March 1942. In 1943 the two remaining ship named air groups, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; Air Group and &quot;Ranger&quot; Air Group were redesignated CVG-3 and CVG-4 respectively.

There were two variations of the CVG designation which added a modifying letter between the V and the G to identify those air groups which operated from the smaller Light Carriers (CVLG) and some of the even smaller escort carriers (CVEG). There were only 26 CVEGs established but the Navy operated over 100 Escort Carriers (CVE)s. Only the largest CVEs were paired with CVEGs while most CVEs were paired with a single Composite Squadron (VC), which consisted of both fighters and bombers, in place of a CVEG. In 1945 the Navy established night air groups which were specifically equipped and trained for combat at night. These night air groups were identified by appending a parenthetical N to the end of the designation &quot;(N)&quot;. In the last months of the war two air groups were established to operate from the new large Midway class &quot;Battle&quot; carriers which were about to join the fleet, these air groups were identified with a &quot;B&quot; between the V and G (CVBG). The war ended before any of the Midway class carriers were commissioned.

The parenthetical (1st), (2nd), (3rd) appended to some Carrier Air Group designations below are not a part of the Group&#x27;s designation. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than once and to specify which use of the designation is indicated. There is not necessarily any lineage connection between Carrier Air Groups which shared the same designation.

====Carrier Air Groups (CVAG, CVBG, CVLG, CVEG) 15 Nov 1946 to 1 Sep 1948====
The seventeen Carrier Air Groups still in existence on 15 November 1946 and one more which was established after that date were redesignated or newly designated in accordance with a new Carrier Air Group Designation scheme which added an &quot;A&quot; for Air Groups assigned to Fleet Carriers (Essex class), and retained the &quot;B&quot; for those assigned to large Fleet Carriers (Midway class), the &quot;L&quot; for those sized to embark aboard Light Carriers (Independence or Saipan classes) and the &quot;E&quot; for those sized for the remaining WWII Escort Carriers.

====Carrier Air Groups (CVG) 1 Sep 1948 to 20 Dec 1963====
The thirteen Carrier Air Groups still in existence on 1 Sep 1948 and eleven which were established between 1 Sep 1948 and 20 Dec 1963 were redesignated again or initially designated in accordance with a new Carrier Air Group designation scheme which redesignated all groups designated CVAG or CVBG back to just &quot;CVG&quot; and disestablished all CVLG and CVEG groups. The seventeen CVGs which were still in existence on 20 December 1963 were on that date redesignated &quot;Carrier Air Wings&quot; (CVW).

Note: the parenthetical (1st), (2nd), (3rd) appended to some Carrier Air Group designations below are not a part of the Group&#x27;s designation. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than one time during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and to specify which use of the designation is indicated. There is not necessarily any connection between Carrier Air Groups which shared the same designation.

: &quot;Two letter tail codes with a first letter &quot;A&quot; denote Atlantic Fleet airwings, while &quot;N&quot; denotes Pacific Fleet airwings.&quot;

====Air Task Groups (ATG) 1 Aug 1950 to 19 Jan 1959====
Two &quot;Air Task Groups&quot; (ATG) were formed in 1951 to address a shortage of Carrier Air Groups (CVG)s due to involvement in the Korean War. The number of CVGs was statutorily limited but the Navy needed more of them. The solution was to form two &quot;temporary&quot; task groups by reassigning some squadrons from existing CVGs and using them to form an ATG. This reduced the number of squadrons in those CVGs from the then typical six total VF/VA squadrons to five total VF/VA squadrons but gave the Navy two more &quot;CVGs&quot;. They were CVG equivalents in every respect but in name but as &quot;temporary&quot; units they were neither formerly &quot;established&quot; or &quot;disestablished&quot; instead they were &quot;formed&quot; and &quot;disbanded.&quot; Though the ATG was created in response to the Korean War, the two formed during that war continued to operate until many years after the war not being disbanded until 1958 and 1959 and in 1955 six more were formed, three of which operated until 1958 and three until 1959.
: &quot;Tail codes with a first letter &quot;A&quot; denote Atlantic Fleet Air Task Groups, while &quot;N&quot; denotes Pacific Fleet Air Task Groups.&quot;

====Antisubmarine Carrier Air Groups (CVSG) 1 Apr 1960 to 30 Jul 1975====
In the 1960s some WWII Essex class aircraft carriers were designated as &quot;Anti-Submarine Carriers&quot; (CVS) and were paired with newly established &quot;Anti-Submarine Carrier Air Groups&quot; (CVSG). CVSGs consisted of Helicopter Antisubmarine (HS) squadrons of SH-3 Sea Kings and Air Antisubmarine (VS) squadrons of S-2 Trackers along with a detachment of airborne early warning E-1 Tracers from Airborne Early Warning (VAW) squadrons and a detachment A-4 Skyhawks for self defense. There were two active and two reserve Anti-Submarine Fighter (VSF) squadrons established for this role but most of the A-4 dets were sourced from Navy or USMC attack (VA/VMA) squadrons. The CVSGs were not included in the redesignation of Carrier Air Groups (CVG)s to Carrier Air Wings (CVW)s in 1963 and therefore they were the last &quot;Carrier Air Groups&quot; to exist in the U.S. Navy.
: &quot;Tail codes with a first letter &quot;A&quot; denoted Atlantic Fleet air groups, while &quot;N&quot; denoted Pacific Fleet air groups (except for RCVSG 51 &quot;RA&quot; which was also a Pacific Fleet air group).&quot;

==== Carrier Air Wings (CVW) December 1963 to present ====
On 20 December 1963 the seventeen Carrier Air Groups (CVG) then in existence (but not the Anti-Submarine Carrier Air Groups (CVSG)) were redesignated to Carrier Air Wings (CVWs).
: &quot;Tail codes with a first letter &quot;A&quot; denote Atlantic Fleet airwings, while &quot;N&quot; denotes Pacific Fleet airwings.&quot;

===Disestablished land based wings===
The U.S. Navy has operated land based wings since 1 October 1937 when it established five &quot;Patrol Wings&quot;. Land based wings have been established, disestablished or re-designated as the Navy has operated different aircraft through the years since then. The tables below list the Navy&#x27;s land based wings which have been disestablished, they also include previously used or no longer used designations of disestablished or currently active wings. For example, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing FIVE was established in October 1937 as Patrol Wing 5, it was re-designated Fleet Air Wing 5 in November 1942, re-designated back to Patrol Wing FIVE in 1973 and finally redesignated to its last designation of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing FIVE in 1999. It was disestablished in 2009. Patrol Wing 5, Fleet Air Wing 5 and Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing FIVE are not three disestablished wings, they are three designations used during the existence of a single wing which was established in October 1937 and disestablished in 2009. Similarly the currently active Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing Atlantic Fleet (HSMWINGLANT) was previously designated Helicopter Anti-Submarine (Light) Wing Atlantic Fleet (HSLWINGLANT), before that it was designated Helicopter Anti-Submarine (Light) Wing ONE (HSLWING ONE) and before that it was designated Helicopter Sea Control Wing THREE (HELSEACONWING THREE). HELSEACONWING THREE, HSLWING ONE and HSLWINGLANT are not three separate disestablished wings as the wing still exists as HSMWINGLANT; they are former designations of the currently active wing which are no longer used.

====Fleet Airship Wings 1942 to 1961 ====
Source:

Fleet Airship Wings (FASW) were established to operate the airship force that the Navy created in WWII. The Navy operated airships prior to the war but individual airships were assigned to airship stations; the airship force was not organized into squadrons, groups and wings until WWII. Note: the parenthetical (1st) and (2nd) appended to the two FASW 1 entries are not a part of either wing&#x27;s designation. They are added to indicate that the FASW 1 designation was used to designate two separate unrelated wings, the first was the WWII wing and the second was created after the war to operate the Navy&#x27;s postwar lighter-than-air fleet.

====Airborne Early Warning Wings (Atlantic and Pacific Barriers) 1955 to 1965====
From 1955 to 1965 the U.S. Navy operated seaward extensions of the nations Distant Early Warning line (DEW line). These extensions were known as the Atlantic Barrier and the Pacific Barrier and they were patrolled by land based Airborne Early Warning (VW) squadrons flying the WV-2/EC-121K Warning Star.
====Training Air Wings 1971 to 1992====
Prior to the establishment of Training Air Wings, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard flight training was conducted by Training Squadrons organized under the Flag Officers &quot;Chief of Naval Air Basic Training&quot; and &quot;Chief of Naval Air Advanced Training&quot; which were aligned under the &quot;Chief of Naval Air Training&quot;. In 1971 and 1972 Eight Training Air Wings were established, each under the command of a Captain who reported directly to the Chief of Naval Air Training eliminating the positions of Chief of Naval Air Basic Training and Chief of Naval Air Advanced Training.

====Patrol, Fleet Air, and Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings 1937 to present====
The tables in this section list disestablished wings as well as former no longer used designations of the two current Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings. 

In 1937 the Navy used the term &quot;wing&quot; for the first time when it established five &quot;Patrol Wings&quot; consisting of squadrons of land based or amphibious patrol aircraft. Note: the parenthetical (1st) and (2nd) appended to some wing designations below are not a part of the wing&#x27;s designation. They are added to indicate that the designation was used more than one time during the history of U.S. Naval Aviation and to specify which use of the designation is indicated. There is not necessarily any connection between Fleet Air Wings and/or Patrol Wings which shared the same designation.

There have been twenty-five Patrol Wings/Fleet Air Wings/Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings since the first five Patrol Wings were established in 1937, two of those twenty-five still exist today. Three of those twenty-five were USNR wings, none of which exist today.

=====Patrol Wings 1937 to 1942=====

=====Fleet Air Wings 1942 to 1973=====

=====Patrol Wings 1973 to 1999=====

=====Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings 1999 and later=====

====Other Functional Wings and Type Wings 1951 to present====
The tables in this section list disestablished wings as well as former no longer used designations of current Type Wings. They do not include Fleet Air Wings, Patrol Wings or Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings as they are included in the &quot;Patrol, Fleet Air, and Patrol and Reconnaissance Wings&quot; tables above.

The Navy&#x27;s first &quot;type wings&quot; were established in the 1950s to provide for the training and readiness of nuclear bomber (Heavy Attack - VAH) squadrons assigned to Carrier Air Groups. In 1967 and 1968 three more such wings were established for the training and readiness of squadrons of specialized aircraft equipped with the emerging technologies of airborne search radar (Carrier Airborne Early Warning - VAW) and electronic warfare (Tactical Electronic Warfare - VAQ). Beginning in 1970 the type wing concept was expanded to eventually include all Carrier Air Wing squadrons.

=====Type Wings 1951 to 1970=====
Carrier Air Group squadrons when not deployed aboard their aircraft carriers were based at Naval Air Stations. From as early as WWII those squadrons and the Naval Air Stations at which they were based, along with all the facilities and infrastructure to support them, all fell under the overall command of a Rear Admiral commanded &quot;Fleet Air&quot; command (Fleet Air West Coast, Fleet Air Norfolk, Fleet Air Seattle etc...). Fleet Air commands ensured squadrons were equipped, trained, manned and ready to deploy and operate as a part of a Carrier Air Group (later, Carrier Air Wing) and they managed the entire shore infrastructure necessary for doing so.

In the 1950s when the Navy began including nuclear bombers (Heavy Attack Squadron – VAH) in Carrier Air Groups it became necessary to create a specialized command between the Fleet Air command and the Heavy Attack Squadrons specifically focused on providing the specialized training to crews and to ensure the upkeep of aircraft required for the safe and effective conduct of this special mission. “Heavy Attack Wings” were organized under the Fleet Air command level to do this. At the same time, Carrier Airborne Early Warning (VAW) squadrons 11 and 12 were providing detachments of aircraft equipped with the emerging technologies of airborne search radar and electronic warfare systems to Carrier Air Groups, and in 1959 a third VAW squadron (VAW-13) split out of VAW-11 to concentrate on electronic warfare. By 1967 VAW-11 and VAW-12 had grown so large that they were elevated to wing status and their detachments were established as squadrons. In 1968 Tactical Electronic Warfare Wing 13 was established to manage the training and readiness of Tactical Electronic Warfare (VAQ) squadrons which were being established. 

The Heavy Attack Wings and the Carrier Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Warfare wings were known as &quot;special mission wings&quot;. They operated under the Fleet Air commands where they were based and ensured their squadrons were ready and capable of executing their unique roles when attached to their Carrier Air Wings for deployment.

Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet wings 1951 to 1970

Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet wings 1956 to 1970

=====Functional and Type Wings 1970 to 1993=====
Between 1970 and 1974 both Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet and Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet underwent reorganizations which replaced Fleet Air commands with wings. Though both fleets each ended up with a wing structure, they went about their reorganizations differently and each ended up with different structures. Naval Air Force, Atlantic created a two tiered wing structure consisting of Flag Officer commanded functional wings with subordinate type wings commanded by Captains. The Functional Wing Commanders reported to the Commander Naval Air Force, Atlantic, commanded the former Fleet Air command Naval Air Stations and shore infrastructure and oversaw their subordinate Captain commanded type wings which were directly responsible for the aircraft squadrons. Naval Air Force, Pacific simply redesignated Flag Officer commanded Fleet Air commands as functional wings essentially leaving the Fleet Air structure in place with a simple name change to wings. The Naval Air Reserve also underwent a reorganization between 1970 and 1975 which created a wing structure unique to the Naval Reserve.

Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet wings 1970 to 1993



Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet wings 1970 to 1993

Naval Air Reserve wings 1970 to 1993

=====Type Wings 1993 and later=====
In 1993 Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet and Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet underwent major reorganization as part of a larger Navy reorganization that began moving command of the shore establishment away from the operating forces. The Flag Officer commanded Functional Wings were disestablished and command of Naval Air Stations and other shore based infrastructure was moved to Flag Officer commands not in the same chain of command as aircraft wings. Type wings were established in the Pacific Fleet commanded by Captains reporting directly to the Commander Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet and in the Atlantic Fleet, the existing type wings were redesignated replacing &quot;ONE&quot; with &quot;Lant&quot; with their commanders reporting directly to the Commander Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet.

This resulted in uniform type wing designations across the two fleets with wings titled AEWWINGLANT &amp; AEWWINGPAC, HSWINGLANT &amp; HSWINGPAC, FITWINGLANT &amp; FITWINGPAC etc... The exception to this balanced organization was Electronic Combat Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet (VAQWINGPAC) which had no Atlantic Fleet counterpart as there had never been an Electronic Combat Wing in the Atlantic Fleet and VAQWINGPAC had always provided squadrons to both Pacific and Atlantic Fleet Carrier Air Wings.

Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet and Naval Air Force, Pacific Fleet wings 1993 and later
&quot;*STRKFIGHTWINGLANT and STRKFIGHTWINGPAC are not disestablished wings, nor are they former designations of currently active wings. They are included in this table only to present a complete picture of the type wing structure as it existed as a result of the 1993 reorganization.&quot;

<text>Batrachoididae is the only family in the ray-finned fish order Batrachoidiformes . Members of this family are usually called [[toadfish]] or frogfish: both the English common name and scientific name refer to their toad-like appearance (&quot;batrakhos&quot; is Greek for frog).

Toadfish are benthic ambush predators that favor sandy or muddy substrates where their cryptic coloration helps them avoid detection by their prey. Toadfish are well known for their ability to &quot;sing&quot;, males in particular using the swim bladder as a sound-production device used to attract mates.

The earliest fossil remains of toadfish are of otoliths from the Early Eocene of France. The earliest articulated fossil taxa are &quot;Louckaichthys&quot; from the Oligocene of the Czech Republic and &quot;Zappaichthys&quot; from the Miocene of Austria. &quot;Bacchiaichthys&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Italy very closely resembles toadfish, but it has some features that seem to refute any classification to the Batrachoidiformes as currently defined; however, toadfish are still thought to have likely diverged from their closest relatives in the Late Cretaceous.

==Description==
Toadfish are usually scaleless, with eyes set high on large heads. Their mouths are also large, with both a maxilla and premaxilla, and often decorated with barbels and skin flaps. They are generally drab in colour, although those living on coral reefs may have brighter patterns. They range in size from length in &quot;Thlassophryne megalops&quot;, to in the Pacuma toadfish.

The gills are small and occur only on the sides of the fish. The pelvic fins are forward of the pectoral fins, usually under the gills, and have one spine with several soft rays. For the two separate dorsal fins, the first is smaller with spines, while the second has from 15 to 25 soft rays. The number of vertebrae range from 25 to 47.

Toadfishes of the genus &quot;Porichthys&quot;, the midshipman fishes, have photophores and four lateral lines. All toadfishes possess sharp spines on the first dorsal fin and on the opercle (gill cover). In fish of the subfamily Thalassophryninae, these are hollow and connect to venom glands capable of delivering a painful wound to predators.

==Distribution and habitat==
Toadfishes are found worldwide. Most toadfish are marine, though some are found in brackish water and one subfamily, the Thalassophryninae, is found exclusively in freshwater habitats in South America. In particular, &quot;Daector quadrizonatus&quot; and &quot;Thalassophryne amazonica&quot; are known from the Atrato River in Colombia and the Amazon River, respectively.

==Habits and reproduction==
Toadfishes are bottom-dwellers, ranging from near-shore areas to deep waters. They tend to be omnivorous, eating sea worms, crustaceans, mollusks, and other fish. They often hide in rock crevices, among the bottom vegetation, or even dig dens in the bottom sediments, from which they ambush their prey. Toadfish can survive out of water for as long as 24 hours, and some can move across exposed mudflats at low tide using their fins.

Males make nests, and then attract females by &quot;singing&quot;, that is, by releasing air by contracting muscles on their swim bladders. The sound has been called a &#x27;hum&#x27; or &#x27;whistle&#x27;, and can be loud enough to be clearly audible from the surface. The eggs are sticky on one side, so the female can attach them to the side of the nest. Each male attracts numerous females to his nest, so the eggs within have multiple mothers.

The male then guards the nest against predators. During this period, the male must survive on a limited supply of food, as he is not able to leave the immediate vicinity to hunt. The eggs rapidly develop into embryos, but these remain attached to the side of the nest until the age of about three to four weeks. After this time, they continue to cluster around and hide behind the male, until they are large enough to fend for themselves. This degree of parental care is very unusual among fishes.

==Genera==
About 83 species of toadfishes are grouped into 21 genera, as:

==Timeline of genera==
==Economics==
Toadfish are not normally commercially exploited, but they are taken by local fishermen as a food fish, and by trawlers where they usually end up as a source of fishmeal and oil. Some smaller toadfish from brackish-water habitats have been exported as freshwater aquarium fishes.

The western Atlantic species &quot;Opsanus tau&quot;, known as the oyster toadfish, is quite widely used as a research animal, while a few species, most notably &quot;Thalassophryne amazonica&quot;, are occasionally kept as aquarium fish.

<doc id="472195" wikidata="Q27033" url="?curid=472195" title="Garden cress">
<text>Cress (Lepidium sativum), sometimes referred to as garden cress (or curly cress) to distinguish it from similar plants also referred to as cress (from Old English &quot;cresse&quot;), is a rather fast-growing, edible herb.

Garden cress is genetically related to watercress and mustard, sharing their peppery, tangy flavour and aroma. In some regions, garden cress is known as mustard and cress, garden pepper cress, pepperwort, pepper grass, or poor man&#x27;s pepper.

This annual plant can reach a height of , with many branches on the upper part. The white to pinkish flowers are only across, clustered in small branched racemes.

When consumed raw, cress is a high-nutrient food containing substantial content of vitamins A, C and K and several dietary minerals.

== In agriculture ==
Cultivation of cress is practical both on mass scales and on the individual scale. Garden cress is suitable for hydroponic cultivation and thrives in slightly alkaline water. In many local markets, the demand for hydroponically grown cress can exceed available supply, partially because cress leaves are not suitable for distribution in dried form, so they can only be partially preserved. Consumers commonly acquire cress as seeds or (in Europe) from markets as boxes of young live shoots.

Edible shoots are typically harvested in one to two weeks after planting, when they are tall.

== Culinary uses ==
Garden cress is added to soups, sandwiches and salads for its tangy flavour. It is also eaten as sprouts, and the fresh or dried seed pods can be used as a peppery seasoning (&quot;haloon&quot;). In the United Kingdom, cut cress shoots are commonly used in sandwiches with boiled eggs and mayonnaise.
==Nutrition==

Raw cress is 89% water, 6% carbohydrates (including 1% dietary fiber), 3% protein and less than 1% fat (table). In a reference quantity, raw cress supplies of food energy and numerous nutrients in significant content, including vitamin K (516% of the Daily Value, DV), vitamin C (83% DV) and vitamin A (43% DV). Among dietary minerals, manganese levels are high (26% DV) while several others, including potassium and magnesium, are in moderate content (table).

== Other uses ==
Garden cress, known as &quot;chandrashoor&quot;, and the seeds, known as aaliv or aleev in Marathi, or &quot;halloon&quot; in India, are commonly used in the system of Ayurveda. It is also known as &quot;asario&quot; in India and the Middle East where it is prized as a medicinal herb, called &quot;habbat al hamra&quot; (literally red seeds) in Arabic. In the Arabian Peninsula, the seeds are traditionally mixed with custard to make a hot drink.

&quot;L. sativum&quot; is often used in experiments to teach biology to students in schools. The plant grows readily on damp paper or cotton, and its fast germination and development time makes it useful in demonstrating plant growth.

<text>Deities &amp; Demigods (abbreviated DDG), alternatively known as Legends &amp; Lore (abbreviated L&amp;L or LL), is a reference book for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game (D&amp;D). The book provides descriptions and game statistics of gods and legendary creatures from various sources in mythology and fiction, and allows dungeon masters to incorporate aspects of religions and mythos into their D&amp;D campaigns.

The first &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; was published in 1980 by TSR, Inc. while another book called &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; was published in 2002 by Wizards of the Coast, which acquired the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; brand with their purchase of TSR in 1998.

The original 1980 edition was the first print appearance of various fictional non-human deities, such as Corellon Larethian, Moradin, Gruumsh, and others, many of which have become standard features of the D&amp;D game and its derivatives. These deities were the creation of Jim Ward. Later printings of &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot;, beginning in 1981, removed some material present in the 1980 printings.

==Printings==

===1st Edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
TSR published the first version of &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; in 1980 as a 144-page hardcover for the first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. This edition, by James M. Ward and Robert J. Kuntz, served to update the material they had earlier included in 1976&#x27;s Supplement IV: &quot;Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; for the original D&amp;D ruleset. The book presents the game statistics and background information for gods and legendary heroes and creatures taken from various mythologies. The original edition included 12 pantheons of gods taken from both myth and folklore, as well as gods for various nonhuman races, and four groups taken from fictional works: the Arthurian heroes, the Nehwon mythos from Fritz Leiber, the Melnibonéan mythos from Michael Moorcock, and the Cthulhu Mythos from H. P. Lovecraft. These statistics are presented in a fashion similar to that of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and illustrations accompany the statistics, as well as a short description that details what circumstances might cause the god to personally appear and what actions the god might take in such an instance, and what responsibilities and penchants that god may have. The book also details the mythoi of these religions, as well as what behaviors are expected of clerics, and describes the known planes of existence and how characters may find themselves in the afterlife . Interior illustrations were submitted by Jeff Dee, Eymoth (Kenneth Rahman), Jennell Jaquays, Dave S. LaForce, Jeff Lanners, Erol Otus, Darlene Pekul, Jim Roslof, David C. Sutherland III, and D.A. Trampier.

The original &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; includes a 9-page chart for clerics, as well as an entire chapter about the various planes of existence.

For the first 1980 printing, TSR obtained permission from Michael Moorcock for inclusion of Melnibonéan material (from his &quot;Elric&quot; series of books), and from Arkham House, which claimed to hold the copyrights on a number of works by H. P. Lovecraft, for inclusion of characters from the Cthulhu Mythos. However, Arkham House had already licensed the Cthulhu property to the game company Chaosium. Furthermore, Chaosium had also licensed the Melnibonéan copyright from Moorcock. When Chaosium threatened legal action, the first printing was halted and the two companies agreed on a compromise: TSR could continue to use the material but must provide a credit to Chaosium to do so. TSR added the credit for the second printing of the book.

The Cthulhu and Melnibonéan sections were removed from the 1981 edition, making it a 128-page hardcover (which resulted in the original edition having a high collector&#x27;s value). TSR felt its material should not contain such an overt reference to one of its competitors and removed the two pantheons altogether, thus negating the need for the credit. For this reason, the first and second printings have generally been in greater demand by D&amp;D fans and collectors. The credit to Chaosium and incorrect page and pantheon counts were still included in some of the subsequent printings.

For the 1985 printing, the book was repackaged and its name was changed to &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot;. This sixth printing featured the name change to avoid potential conflicts with fundamentalist Christian groups such as Patricia Pulling&#x27;s BADD. Despite the name change and new cover artwork (by Jeff Easley), the interior material was nearly identical to the fifth printing.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

===2nd Edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
When the second edition of the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game was released, a new &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; was written for it. Cover art is by Jeff Easley, with interior illustrations by George Barr, Terry Dykstra, Erol Otus, Erik Olsen, Jean Elizabeth Martin, Jeff Easley, Carol Heyer, Roger Loveless, John and Laura Lakey, and Keith Parkinson. &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; was expanded, completely revised from the 1st Edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; volume, and rewritten for the 2nd Edition rules. This edition had pared-down content in comparison to the original; the sections on Babylonian, Finnish, Sumerian and non-humanoid deities were wholly excised. The Central American mythos was renamed the Aztec mythos, while the Nehwon mythos was retained. A separate sourcebook, &quot;Monster Mythology&quot;, later covered the non-human deities in much greater detail than any previous source, introducing several new deities in the process. Furthermore, the late 2nd Edition Planescape book, &quot;On Hallowed Ground&quot;, gave a virtually comprehensive look at the various pantheons present in the D&amp;D shared universe up to that point, and a level of detail not since exceeded.

===3rd Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
For the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the name was changed back to &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; and the cover artwork was changed again to bring it more in line with other third edition D&amp;D manuals. The interior material bears little resemblance to the previous printings of the book (first through sixth). Additionally, this edition presents only a few historical pantheons and in something of a vacuum, without any reference to or inclusion of their development in previous D&amp;D sources, choosing instead to detail them as one-off campaign options.

The third edition volume was written by Rich Redman, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt. The cover illustration was by Sam Wood, with interior illustrations by Kyle Anderson, Glen Angus, Matt Cavotta, Dennis Cramer, Tony DiTerlizzi, Jeff Easley, Donato Giancola, Lars Grant-West, Rebecca Guay, Matt Mitchell, Eric Peterson, Wayne Reynolds, Darrell Riche, Richard Sardinha, and Brian Snoddy, with Justin Norman, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood.

James Wyatt comments on the book&#x27;s relationship to similar books from earlier editions: &quot;This book owes a lot to the 1st Edition &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot;/&quot;Legends and Lore&quot; book, more so than the 2nd Edition version. However, the new material we introduced meant that we had a lot less room to include the variety of pantheons included in the earlier version. So we chose the pantheons that we felt were (a) most popular and (b) most ensconced in the popular culture of fantasy: the Greek, Norse, and Egyptian. It stung a bit to leave out the Celtic deities, but we just didn&#x27;t have the space.&quot;

===4th Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
Rather than a separate sourcebook, &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; is the name of a semi-regular column in &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines. &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; articles in &quot;Dragon&quot; offers options for players and tips on roleplaying worshippers of a particular god, while articles in &quot;Dungeon&quot; offer backstory and monsters that DMs can use in a campaign. Starting with &quot;Dragon&quot; #380, the column was renamed &quot;Channel Divinity&quot;, though it continues to appear under its original name in &quot;Dungeon&quot;.

==Artwork==
The artwork for the first several printings of this &quot;cyclopedia&quot; was created by artists Jeff Dee, Erol Otus, Eymoth, Darlene Pekul, Jennell Jaquays, Jim Roslof, David S. LaForce, David C. Sutherland III, Jeff Lanners, and David A. Trampier, with each artist usually providing all the artwork for an entire pantheon. Erol Otus produced the cover artwork.

The most recent printings of the book contain illustrations from numerous artists and are more in line with the Wizards of the Coast modern treatment of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. These illustrations are in full color, as compared to the black and white art of the original.

==Legal history==
&quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; was one of many items named in a 1992 lawsuit between TSR and Game Designers&#x27; Workshop regarding the &quot;Dangerous Journeys&quot; role-playing game and various rulebooks/sourcebooks designed for that game. One section of this lawsuit argued that &quot;The Plane of Shadow in MYTHUS (pages 190 and 402) and MYTHUS MAGICK (pages 21–22, ...) is derived from the Plane of Shadow in the AD&amp;D DEITIES &amp; DEMIGODS book (Appendix 1, page 129); ...&quot;

==Reception==
===1st Edition===
Kevin Frey reviewed the supplement in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 34. He commented that &quot;If you like a wide variety of deities, this is for you. The gods range from Greek to Chinese to Newhon.&quot; He noted that &quot;The problem with this book is that worshippers&#x27; alignments are too restricted. For example, in the Melnibonean mythos, there are no gods for the alignments of lawful-evil, chaotic-good, lawful-neutral, or neutral-good; the majority were chaotic-evil. What good is a godless lawful-evil cleric?&quot; Frey concluded his review by saying, &quot;On the whole, it&#x27;s worth [the price]. Any AD&amp;D DM should get this book.&quot;

The original &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; was reviewed by Andy Slack in issue #23 of the magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (February/March 1981), who gave the book a rating of 8 out of 10. Slack called the book &quot;an integral part of the rules&quot;, and he found the quick reference chart for clerics particularly worthwhile, which describe items such as what a cleric should wear, what his holy colors and animals are, when and where he should worship, and what he should sacrifice. Slack felt that the book provides an alternative to the approach of inventing one&#x27;s own religions, &quot;which I expect most &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; DMs will employ&quot;.

Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, was critical of the format used for the original &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot;: &quot;Unfortunately, the book is usually used merely as a sort of &quot;Monster Manual&quot; that describes very high-powered monsters. This usage is encouraged by the book&#x27;s format, which emphasizes the gods&#x27; physical abilities over their religious significance.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Nick Ozment said &quot;One of the most fun, crazy, and controversial tomes to come out of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was, without a doubt, &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; (1980).&quot; Ozment later commented on the artwork by Erol Otus, calling it &quot;some of the oddest, most bizarre, and original illustrations in his &quot;D&amp;D&quot; oeuvre. This stuff looks like it burst straight out of the most trippy Cthulhu for underground comics of the &#x27;70s.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014 listed &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; by Erol Otus as #5 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time.

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; as #7 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;it is hard to recover an Erol Otus, but this image of Odin is probably one of the best you will ever see. Jeff truly knocked this one out of the park in my opinion.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath called it a &quot;beguiling book. Much of its initial promise is delivered in the contours of Erol Otus&#x27;s epic wraparound cover painting.&quot; However, Horvath noted by listing the deities&#x27; hit points and other game statistics, the book tacitly encouraged high-level power gamers to take on the deities in combat. Nonetheless, Horvath felt the lasting effect of this book was that it may have &quot;encouraged a generation of players to embrace an abiding interest in mythology.&quot;

===2nd Edition===
Keith Eisenbeis reviewed the manual in the June–July 1991 issue of &quot;White Wolf&quot;. His overall view was generally negative while he noted details about priests as a positive. He rated it overall at a 2 out of 5 possible points, qualifying it as &quot;a substandard product&quot;.

Schick calls the second edition of &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; for the 2nd edition rules &quot;a vast improvement... with a much greater emphasis on mythology and the duties of each deity&#x27;s priesthood&quot;.

===3rd Edition===
The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; commented on the art for the third edition &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot;, stating that the book &quot;uses a broader mix of styles than earlier books; some art is done is a more abstract fashion that stands in stark contrast to the crisp look of the veteran Wizards of the Coast artists&quot;.

James Voelpel from mania.com commented: &quot;The rulebook&#x27;s mix of excellent artwork, rules and layout makes &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; a real winner. Once again, it is a bit pricey for the average gamer at $29.95, but well worth it for the contents.&quot;

The third edition &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; won the 2002 Ennie Award for &quot;Best Art (Interior)&quot;.

<doc id="472205" wikidata="Q1110189" url="?curid=472205" title="2001 Danish general election">
<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 20 November 2001. For the first time since the 1924 elections, the Social Democrats did not win the most seats. Anders Fogh Rasmussen of the centre-right became Prime Minister in coalition with the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, as the head of the first Rasmussen government, with the support from Danish People&#x27;s Party.

The coalition relied on the votes of other right-wing parties such as the Danish People&#x27;s Party, which polled better than ever before. Voter turnout was 87.1% in Denmark proper, 80.0% in the Faroe Islands and 61.5% in Greenland. The led coalition government would last until the 2011 election, lasting through two intermediate elections.

The election marked a major shift in Danish politics: It was the first time that the right leaning parties held an outright majority in the parliament since the beginning of the modern democratic system in Denmark in 1901; although right leaning parties had held power several times, they had always had to share power with more centrist or left-wing parties in coalition governments, such as the Danish Social Liberal Party. Historian Bo Lidegaard said that the vote showed a move away from broad national consensus which had existed since the 1930s regarding the style of governance in Denmark. One of the most important changes that forced the change was the rise of immigration as a political issue and the ensuing rise of the Danish People&#x27;s Party. Immigration played a central role in the 2001 campaign and was thrust into focus by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, although it had been gaining attention for years.

<doc id="472210" wikidata="Q773842" url="?curid=472210" title="North Rona">
<text>Rona () is an uninhabited Scottish island in the North Atlantic. It is often referred to as North Rona to distinguish it from the island of South Rona in the Inner Hebrides. It has an area of and a maximum elevation of .

It is the most remote island in the British Isles ever to have been inhabited on a long-term basis.

Rona is included within the historic county of Ross-shire. Although uninhabited, the island (along with Sula Sgeir) is included in the Western Isles Council electoral ward of An Taobh Siar agus Nis, the Scottish Parliament constituency of Na h-Eileanan an Iar, the electoral region of Highlands and Islands, and the UK Parliament constituency of Na h-Eileanan an lar.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Rona&quot; may come from , Old Norse for &quot;rough island&quot;, or a combination of and , Gaelic and Old Norse for &quot;seal&quot; and &quot;island&quot; respectively. Alternatively, it may have been named after St Rónán of Iona. The English language qualifier &quot;North&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish the island from Rona off Skye. In Gaelic, it is also known as , which is literally &quot;Rona of the stag&quot;, but may be derived from , containing the genitive singular of the Gaelic word , meaning &quot;ocean&quot;, and conveying the meaning &quot;Rona of the Atlantic&quot;.

==Geography==

The island lies northwest of Cape Wrath, the same distance north-northeast of the Butt of Lewis, and east of Sula Sgeir. More remote than St Kilda, it is the most remote island in the British Isles ever to have been inhabited on a long-term basis.

It is also the closest neighbour of the Faroe Islands, which are northwest. By comparison, the distances to its own national capitals are notably longer: to Edinburgh and to London.

The geological structure of the island is that of hornblende schist and gneiss with pegmatite intrusions.

==History==
===8th to 18th centuries===

St. Ronan is said to have been the first inhabitant. St Ronan founded a small monastic community on the island and was reputedly buried there along with his sister Mionagan. His other sister, Saint Brianuil (Brenhilda), and Saint Flannan went to live on other islands. 

A tiny early Christian oratory, which may date as early as the eighth century and is built of unmortared stone, survives virtually complete on the island – the best-preserved structure of this type in Scotland. A number of simple cross-slabs of early medieval date are preserved within the structure, probably the grave markers of Dark Age monks or hermits from Scotland or Ireland. 

Writing in the 16th century Dean Monro wrote:
Towards the north northeist from Lewis, three score myles of sea, lyes ane little ile callit Ronay, laiche maine lande, inhabit and manurit be simple people, scant of ony religione. This ile is uther haffe myle lange, and haffe myle braide; aboundance of corne growes on it by delving onlie, aboundance of clover gerse for sheipe. Ther is an certain number of ky and sheipe ordainit for this ile be ther awin ald right, extending to sa maney as may be sustainit upon the said gerssing, and the countrey is so fertill of gerssing, that the super-excrescens of the said ky and schiepe baith feidis them in flesche, and als payes ther dewties with the samen for the maist pairt. Within this ile there is sic faire whyte beir meal made like flour, and quhen they slay their sheipe, they slay them belly flaught, and stuffes ther skins fresche of the bear meil, and send their dewties be a servant of M’Cloyd of Lewis, with certain reistit muttan, and mony reistit foulis. Within this ile there is ane chapell, callit St. Ronay’s chapell, unto quhilk chapell, as the ancients of the country alledges, they leave an spaid and ane shuil, quhen any man dies, and upon the morrow findes the place of the grave markit with an spaid, as they alledge. In this ile they use to take maney quhaills and uther grate fisches.

In 1680 Martin Martin recorded the visit of Rev. Daniel Morison to the island. &quot;Upon my landing the natives received me very affectionately, and addressed me with their usual salutation to a stranger: &#x27;God save you, pilgrim, you are heartily welcome here; for we have had repeated apparitions of your person among us (after the manner of the second sight), and we heartily congratulate your arrival in this our remote country. Morison also reported that there were five families living there who &quot;take their surname from the colour of the sky, rainbow, and clouds&quot; and that &quot;they repeat the Lord’s Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments in the chapel every Sunday morning. They have cows, sheep, barley and oats, and live a harmless life, being perfectly ignorant of most of those vices that abound in the world. They know nothing of money or gold, having no occasion for either.&quot; 

The island continued to be inhabited until the entire population of thirty died shortly after 1685. This was in part due to an infestation by rats, probably the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), which reached the island after a shipwreck. The rats raided the food stocks of barley meal, and it is possible that the inhabitants starved to death, although plague may have been a contributory factor. A contributory factor was that a few months after the infestation, &quot;some seamen landed there, who robbed the poor people of their bull.&quot; This all occurred in a year in which it is reported that no further ships reached the remote island to supply or trade. The rats themselves eventually starved to death, as the huge swells the island experiences prevented their hunting along the rocky shores.

The island was resettled, but again largely depopulated due to a boating accident, after which it remained home to a succession of shepherds and their families. The island had a population of nine in 1764 and &quot;one family&quot; in 1796.

===Victorian era===
A Dr. MacCulloch landed on the island in 1815 and recorded that the inhabitants were the shepherd, Kenneth MacCagie, his wife and three children and his elderly mother living in a house that was largely underground. However, when he landed they ran and hid for they had not had a visitor for seven years and were afraid that MacCulloch and his party were &quot;pirates or Americans&quot;. 

Scottish Victorian historian John Swinburne recorded that on one occasion between 1811 and 1847, a crew from Ness in Lewis had their boat wrecked in landing at Sula Sgeir in the month of June, and lived on the island for several weeks, sustaining themselves on the flesh of birds. Captain Benjamin Oliver, who commanded the revenue cruiser &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, visited Sula Sgeir in the month of August to look for the boat and &quot;found the wreck of it, also an oar on end with an old pair of canvas trousers on it, and over the remains of a fire a pot containing birds&#x27; flesh; but there being no trace of the men, it was thought they must have been picked up by a passing vessel.&quot;

Nothing further was heard of them until October of that year, when a Russian vessel on her homeward voyage met a Stornoway craft in Orkney &quot;and informed the crew of the latter that they had taken the men off Sula Sgeir and landed them in Rona.&quot; Captain Oliver immediately went to North Rona and &quot;found the crew consuming the last barrel of potatoes which the poor shepherd had&quot;. He took away the crew and left the shepherd with &quot;sufficient provision for the winter.&quot; 
Swinburne&#x27;s research found that the last family to live on Rona &quot;was that of a shepherd named Donald M&#x27;Leod, otherwise the &#x27;King of Rona&#x27;, who returned to Lewis in 1844.&quot; Sir James Matheson, who bought Lewis in 1844, offered the island to the Government for use as a penal settlement. The offer was refused.

Although farmers from Lewis have continued to graze sheep on Rona ever since then, the island has remained uninhabited, apart from a short period in 1884–85. In June 1884, two men from Lewis, Malcolm MacDonald and Murdo Mackay, having reportedly had a dispute with the minister of their local church, went to stay on Rona to look after the sheep. In August, boatmen who had called at the island reported that the men were well and in good spirits, and had refused offers to take them back to Lewis. In April 1885, the next people to visit Rona found that the two men had died during the winter.

===U-boat landings===
During World War I, the commander of German U-boat &quot;U-90&quot;, Walter Remy, stopped his submarine at North Rona during each of his wartime patrols, weather permitting, and sent crewmen onto the island to shoot sheep to obtain mutton for on-board consumption. Evidence for this was provided by American prisoner of war Edouard Izac who was captured from a lifeboat after the sinking of the troopship &quot;USS President Lincoln&quot; on 31 May 1918; &quot;U-90&quot; was in service from August 1917 onwards and had previously shelled the Hirta radio station on St Kilda on 15 May 1918.

Captain Remy also commanded &quot;U-24&quot; from June 1916 to July 1917.
Stuart Crawford, writing for the &quot;UK Defence Journal&quot;, notes that the war diary of &quot;U-90&quot; &quot;stated that it shot 7 sheep to augment crew rations on the 5th June 1918&quot;; he also recalls a local story from Islay that an unnamed German tourist visiting in 1921 spoke of landing several times at Glas Uig (near Ardtalla) whilst serving in a U-boat. In terms of the probability of other landings, Rona was undefended and over 300 U-boats were active in the war, mostly in the North Atlantic; however, 200 were lost in action and many personal accounts from submarine crewmen and officers were therefore not recorded for history.

===Modern history===

The island was occupied temporarily in 1938 and 1939 by author and conservationist Frank Fraser Darling with his wife Bobbie and their son Alasdair, while they studied the grey seals and the breeding seabirds.

Since 1984, Rona has hosted an automatic light beacon, remotely monitored by the Northern Lighthouse Board and constructed in 1984.

In &quot;Island at the edge of the world&quot;, published in 2006, the poet Kathleen Jamie describes a visit to the island, as well as in an essay in her collection &quot;Sightlines&quot;.

The governance of Rona has changed from Ross-shire to Ross and Cromarty in 1890, and to the Western Isles in 1975, and from the Ross and Cromarty parliamentary constituency to the Western Isles (Na h-Eileanan an Iar) constituency in 1918, although without noticeable change due to its remoteness and lack of population. With a previous history of habitation from Scotland, it has not been necessary for the UK to claim Rona as territory, as happened for Rockall under the Island of Rockall Act 1972 and 1955 Royal Warrant. Rockall and St Kilda are also located within the Western Isles for governance purposes.

North Rona, with Sula Sgeir formed part of the Barvas estate based on Lewis. A community buy-out of the estate in 2016 did not include the two islands, which would have increased the purchase price by £80,000 and the islands remained in the hands of the Duckworth family.

==Environment==
Together with Sula Sgeir, the island was formerly managed by Scottish Natural Heritage as a nature reserve, for its important grey seal and seabird colonies. These include the European storm-petrel and the larger Leach&#x27;s storm-petrel, for which North Rona is an important breeding locality remains a protected area for nature and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area. Bog cotton is a common flowering plant.

===Important Bird Area===
The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding populations of several species of seabirds.

==North Rona Lighthouse==

The North Rona Lighthouse is managed by the Northern Lighthouse Board. Constructed in 1984, the light is atop a square white tower which is 9m high.

<text>The occipital lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The name derives from its position at the back of the head, from the Latin , &#x27;behind&#x27;, and , &#x27;head&#x27;.

The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is Brodmann area 17, commonly called V1 (visual one). Human V1 is located on the medial side of the occipital lobe within the calcarine sulcus; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the occipital pole. V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin, the stria of Gennari. Visually driven regions outside V1 are called extrastriate cortex. There are many extrastriate regions, and these are specialized for different visual tasks, such as visuospatial processing, color differentiation, and motion perception. Bilateral lesions of the occipital lobe can lead to cortical blindness (see Anton&#x27;s syndrome).

==Structure==
The two occipital lobes are the smallest of four paired lobes in the human brain. Located in the rearmost portion of the skull, the occipital lobes are part of the posterior cerebrum. The lobes of the brain are named from the overlying bone and the occipital bone overlies the occipital lobes.

The lobes rest on the tentorium cerebelli, a process of dura mater that separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum. They are structurally isolated in their respective cerebral hemispheres by the separation of the cerebral fissure. At the front edge of the occipital lobe are several occipital gyri, which are separated by lateral occipital sulcus.

The occipital aspects along the inside face of each hemisphere are divided by the calcarine sulcus. Above the medial, Y-shaped sulcus lies the cuneus, and the area below the sulcus is the lingual gyrus.

Damage to the primary visual areas of the occipital lobe can cause partial or complete blindness.

==Function==
The occipital lobe is divided into several functional visual areas. Each visual area contains a full map of the visual world. Although there are no anatomical markers distinguishing these areas (except for the prominent striations in the striate cortex), physiologists have used electrode recordings to divide the cortex into different functional regions.

The first functional area is the primary visual cortex. It contains a low-level description of the local orientation, spatial-frequency and color properties within small receptive fields. Primary visual cortex projects to the occipital areas of the ventral stream (visual area V2 and visual area V4), and the occipital areas of the dorsal stream—visual area V3, visual area MT (V5), and the dorsomedial area (DM).

The ventral stream is known for processing the &quot;what&quot; in vision, while the dorsal stream handles the &quot;where/how&quot;. This is because the ventral stream provides important information for the identification of stimuli that are stored in memory. With this information in memory, the dorsal stream is able to focus on motor actions in response to the outside stimuli.

Although numerous studies have shown that the two systems are independent and structured separately from another, there is also evidence that both are essential for successful perception, especially as the stimuli take on more complex forms. For example, a case study using fMRI was done on shape and location. The first procedure consisted of location tasks. The second procedure was in a lit-room where participants were shown stimuli on a screen for 600 ms. They found that the two pathways play a role in shape perception even though location processing continues to lie within the dorsal stream.

The dorsomedial (DM) is not as thoroughly studied. However, there is some evidence that suggests that this stream interacts with other visual areas. A case study on monkeys revealed that information from V1 and V2 areas make up half the inputs in the DM. The remaining inputs are from multiple sources that have to do with any sort of visual processing 

A significant functional aspect of the occipital lobe is that it contains the primary visual cortex.

Retinal sensors convey stimuli through the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate bodies, where optic radiations continue to the visual cortex. Each visual cortex receives raw sensory information from the outside half of the retina on the same side of the head and from the inside half of the retina on the other side of the head. The cuneus (Brodmann&#x27;s area 17) receives visual information from the contralateral superior retina representing the inferior visual field. The lingula receives information from the contralateral inferior retina representing the superior visual field. The retinal inputs pass through a &quot;way station&quot; in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus before projecting to the cortex. Cells on the posterior aspect of the occipital lobes&#x27; gray matter are arranged as a spatial map of the retinal field. Functional neuroimaging reveals similar patterns of response in cortical tissue of the lobes when the retinal fields are exposed to a strong pattern.

==Clinical significance==
If one occipital lobe is damaged, the result can be homonymous hemianopsia vision loss from similarly positioned &quot;field cuts&quot; in each eye. Occipital lesions can cause visual hallucinations. Lesions in the parietal-temporal-occipital association area are associated with color agnosia, movement agnosia, and agraphia. Lesions near the left occipital lobe can result in pure alexia (alexia without agraphia). Damage to the primary visual cortex, which is located on the surface of the posterior occipital lobe, can cause blindness due to the holes in the visual map on the surface of the visual cortex that resulted from the lesions.

===Epilepsy===
Recent studies have shown that specific neurological findings have affected idiopathic occipital lobe epilepsies. Occipital lobe seizures are triggered by a flash, or a visual image that contains multiple colors. These are called flicker stimulation (usually through TV) these seizures are referred to as photo-sensitivity seizures. Patients having experienced occipital seizures described their seizures as featuring bright colors, and severely blurring their vision (vomiting was also apparent in some patients). Occipital seizures are triggered mainly during the day, through television, video games or any flicker stimulatory system. Occipital seizures originate from an epileptic focus confined within the occipital lobes. They may be spontaneous or triggered by external visual stimuli. Occipital lobe epilepsies are etiologically idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic. Symptomatic occipital seizures can start at any age, as well as any stage after or during the course of the underlying causative disorder. Idiopathic occipital epilepsy usually starts in childhood. Occipital epilepsies account for approximately 5% to 10% of all epilepsies.

<doc id="472216" wikidata="Q26803" url="?curid=472216" title="Tamil script">
<text>The Tamil script ( ) is an abugida script that is used by Tamils and Tamil speakers in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere to write the Tamil language. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. Certain minority languages such as Saurashtra, Badaga, Irula and Paniya are also written in the Tamil script.

==Characteristics==

The Tamil script has 12 vowels (, , &quot;soul-letters&quot;), 18 consonants (, , &quot;body-letters&quot;) and one special character, the (, ). is called &quot;அக்கு&quot;, &quot;akku,&quot; and is classified in Tamil orthography as being neither a consonant nor a vowel. However, it is listed at the end of the vowel set. The script is syllabic, not alphabetic, and is written from left to right.

==History==

The Tamil script, like the other Brahmic scripts, is thought to have evolved from the original Brahmi script. The earliest inscriptions which are accepted examples of Tamil writing date to the Ashokan period. The script used by such inscriptions is commonly known as the Tamil-Brahmi or &quot;Tamili script&quot; and differs in many ways from standard Ashokan Brahmi. For example, early Tamil-Brahmi, unlike Ashokan Brahmi, had a system to distinguish between pure consonants (&quot;m&quot;, in this example) and consonants with an inherent vowel (&quot;ma&quot;, in this example). In addition, according to Iravatham Mahadevan, early Tamil Brahmi used slightly different vowel markers, had extra characters to represent letters not found in Sanskrit and omitted letters for sounds not present in Tamil such as voiced consonants and aspirates. Inscriptions from the 2nd century use a later form of Tamil-Brahmi, which is substantially similar to the writing system described in the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;, an ancient Tamil grammar. Most notably, they used the &quot;puḷḷi&quot; to suppress the inherent vowel. The Tamil letters thereafter evolved towards a more rounded form and by the 5th or 6th century, they had reached a form called the &quot;early vaṭṭeḻuttu&quot;.

The modern Tamil script does not, however, descend from that script. In the 4th century, the Pallava dynasty created a new script called Pallava script for Tamil and the Grantha alphabet evolved from it, adding the Vaṭṭeḻuttu alphabet for sounds not found to write Sanskrit. Parallel to Grantha alphabet a new script (Chola-Pallava script, which evolved to modern Tamil script) again emerged in Pallava and Chola territories resembling the same glyph development like Grantha, however, heavily reduced in its shapes and not overtaking non-native Tamil sounds. By the 8th century, the new scripts supplanted Vaṭṭeḻuttu in the Pallava and Chola kingdoms which lay in the north portion of the Tamil-speaking region. However, Vaṭṭeḻuttu continued to be used in the southern portion of the Tamil-speaking region, in the Chera and Pandyan kingdoms until the 11th century, when the Pandyan kingdom was conquered by the Cholas who inherited while being feudatory of Pallavas for a short time.

With the fall of Pallava kingdom, the Chola dynasty pushed the Chola-Pallava script as the de facto script. Over the next few centuries, the Chola-Pallava script evolved into the modern Tamil script. The Grantha and its parent script influenced the Tamil script notably. The use of palm leaves as the primary medium for writing led to changes in the script. The scribe had to be careful not to pierce the leaves with the stylus while writing because a leaf with a hole was more likely to tear and decay faster. As a result, the use of the &quot;puḷḷi&quot; to distinguish pure consonants became rare, with pure consonants usually being written as if the inherent vowel were present. Similarly, the vowel marker () called: , a half-rounded &quot;u&quot; which occurs at the end of some words and in the medial position in certain compound words, marking a shortened &quot;u&quot; sound, also fell out of use and was replaced by the marker for the simple &quot;u&quot; ()&quot;.&quot; The &quot;puḷḷi&quot; () did not fully reappear until the introduction of printing, but the marker &quot;kuṟṟiyal-ukaram&quot; () never came back for this purpose into use although its usage is retained in certain grammatical conceptual words whereas the sound itself still exists and plays an important role in Tamil prosody.

The forms of some of the letters were simplified in the 19th century to make the script easier to typeset. In the 20th century, the script was simplified even further in a series of reforms, which regularised the vowel markers used with consonants by eliminating special markers and most irregular forms.

==Relationship with other Indic scripts==
The Tamil script differs from other Brahmi-derived scripts in a number of ways. Unlike every other Brahmic script, it does not regularly represent voiced or aspirated stop consonants as these are not phonemes of the Tamil language even though voiced and fricative allophones of stops do appear in spoken Tamil. Thus the character &quot;k&quot;, for example, represents but can also be pronounced [] or [] based on the rules of Tamil phonology. A separate set of characters appears for these sounds when the Tamil script is used to write Sanskrit or other languages.

Also unlike other Brahmi scripts, the Tamil script rarely uses typographic ligatures to represent conjunct consonants, which are far less frequent in Tamil than in other Indian languages. Where they occur, conjunct consonants are written by writing the character for the first consonant, adding the &quot;puḷḷi&quot; to suppress its inherent vowel, and then writing the character for the second consonant. There are a few exceptions, namely &quot;kṣa&quot; and &quot;śrī&quot;.

ISO 15919 is an international standard for the transliteration of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script.

== Letters ==


===Basic consonants===
Consonants are called the &quot;body&quot; (&quot;mei&quot;) letters. The consonants are classified into three categories: &quot;vallinam&quot; (hard consonants), &quot;mellinam&quot; (soft consonants, including all nasals), and &quot;itayinam&quot; (medium consonants).

There are some lexical rules for the formation of words. The &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot; describes such rules. Some examples: a word cannot end in certain consonants, and cannot begin with some consonants including r-, l- and ḻ-; there are six nasal consonants in Tamil: a velar nasal ங், a palatal nasal ஞ், a retroflex nasal ண், a dental nasal ந், a bilabial nasal ம், and an alveolar nasal ன்.

The order of the alphabet (strictly abugida) in Tamil closely matches that of the nearby languages both in location and linguistics, reflecting the common origin of their scripts from Brahmi.

Tamil language has 18 consonants - &quot;mey eluttukkal&quot;. Traditional grammarians have classified these 18 into three groups of 6 letters each. This classification is done based on the method of articulation and hence the nature of these letters. &quot;Vallinam&quot; (hard group), &quot;mellinam&quot; (soft group) and &quot;idaiyinam&quot; (medium group). All consonants are pronounced for a half unit (māttirai) time length when isolated (consonants combined with vowels will be pronounced with the time length of the vowel).


===Extra consonants used in Tamil===
The Tamil speech has incorporated many phonemes that were not part of the Tolkāppiyam classification. The letters used to write these sounds, known as Grantha, are used as part of Tamil. These are taught from elementary school and incorporated in Tamil All Character Encoding (TACE16).


There is also the compound (), equivalent to in Devanagari.

Combinations of consonants with (, , equivalent to nuqta) are occasionally used to represent phonemes of foreign languages, especially to write Islamic and Christian texts. For example: asif = , azārutīn̠ = , Genghis Khan = .

A nuqta-like diacritic is used while writing the Badaga language and double dot nuqta for the Irula language to transcribe its sounds.

There has also been effort to differentiate voiced and voiceless consonants through subscripted numbers – two, three, and four which stand for the unvoiced aspirated, voiced, voiced aspirated respectively. This was used to transcribe Sanskrit words in Sanskrit–Tamil books, as shown in the table below.
The Unicode Standard uses superscripted digits for the same purpose, as in , , and .

===Vowels===
Vowels are also called the &#x27;life&#x27; (&quot;uyir&quot;) or &#x27;soul&#x27; letters. Together with the consonants (&quot;mei&quot;, which are called &#x27;body&#x27; letters), they form compound, syllabic (abugida) letters that are called &#x27;living&#x27; or &#x27;embodied&#x27; letters (&quot;uyir mei&quot;, i.e. letters that have both &#x27;body&#x27; and &#x27;soul&#x27;).

Tamil language has 12 vowels which are divided into short and long (five of each type) and two diphthongs.
====Compound form====
Using the consonant &#x27;k&#x27; as an example:

The special letter , represented by three dots, is called or &quot;aḵ&quot;. It originally represented an archaic Tamil retention of the Dravidian sound ḥ, which has been lost in almost all modern Dravidian languages, and in Tamil traditionally serves a purely grammatical function, but in modern times it has come to be used as a diacritic to represent foreign sounds. For example, is used for the English sound &quot;f&quot;, not found in Tamil. It also served before palm leaves became the primary writing medium for words ending with an inherent consonsant-vowel &quot;u&quot; as a pronouncing rule for a short &quot;u&quot;, called&quot;&quot;. Following consonants rendered this behaviour: , , , , , . Instead of writing like in modern days without any markers, for example (), it was written with a preceding , like .

Another archaic Tamil letter , represented by a small hollow circle and called , is the &quot;Anusvara&quot;. It was traditionally used as a homorganic nasal when in front of a consonant, and either as a bilabial nasal () or alveolar nasal () at the end of a word, depending on the context.

The long () vowels are about twice as long as the short () vowels. The diphthongs are usually pronounced about one and a half times as long as the short vowels, though some grammatical texts place them with the long () vowels.

As can be seen in the compound form, the vowel sign can be added to the right, left or both sides of the consonants. It can also form a ligature. These rules are evolving and older use has more ligatures than modern use. What you actually see on this page depends on your font selection; for example, Code2000 will show more ligatures than Latha.

There are proponents of script reform who want to eliminate all ligatures and let all vowel signs appear on the right side.

Unicode encodes the character in logical order (always the consonant first), whereas legacy 8-bit encodings (such as TSCII) prefer the written order. This makes it necessary to reorder when converting from one encoding to another; it is not sufficient simply to map one set of code points to the other.

==== Compound table of Tamil letters ====
The following table lists vowel ( or life) letters across the top and consonant ( or body) letters along the side, the combination of which gives all Tamil compound () letters.

=== Writing order ===


== Numerals and symbols ==

Apart from the usual numerals (from 0 to 9), Tamil also has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for fraction and other number-based concepts can also be found.


== Unicode ==
Tamil script was added to the Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0.0. The Unicode block for Tamil is U+0B80–U+0BFF. Grey areas indicate non-assigned code points. Most of the non-assigned code points are designated reserved because they are in the same relative position as characters assigned in other South Asian script blocks that correspond to phonemes that don&#x27;t exist in the Tamil script.

Efforts to unify the Grantha script with Tamil have been made; however the proposals triggered discontent by some. Eventually, considering the sensitivity involved, it was determined that the two scripts should be encoded independently, except for the numerals.

Proposals to encode characters used for fractional values in traditional accounting practices were submitted. Although discouraged by the ICTA of Sri Lanka, the proposal was recognized by the Government of Tamil Nadu and were added to the Unicode Standard in March 2019 with the release of version 12.0. The Unicode block for Tamil Supplement is U+11FC0–U+11FFF:

===Syllabary===
Like other South Asian scripts in Unicode, the Tamil encoding was originally derived from the ISCII standard. Both ISCII and Unicode encode Tamil as an abugida. In an abugida, each basic character represents a consonant and default vowel. Consonants with a different vowel or bare consonants are represented by adding a modifier character to a base character. Each code point representing a similar phoneme is encoded in the same relative position in each South Asian script block in Unicode, including Tamil. Because Unicode represents Tamil as an abugida all the pure consonants (consonants with no associated vowel) and syllables in Tamil can be represented by combining multiple Unicode code points, as can be seen in the Unicode Tamil Syllabary below. In Unicode 5.1, named sequences were added for all Tamil consonants and syllables.

Unicode 5.1 also has a named sequence for the Tamil ligature SRI (&quot;śrī&quot;), ஶ்ரீ, written using ஶ (&quot;śa&quot;). The name of this sequence is TAMIL SYLLABLE SHRII and is composed of the Unicode sequence U+0BB6 U+0BCD U+0BB0 U+0BC0. The ligature can also be written using ஸ (&quot;sa&quot;) to create an identical ligature ஸ்ரீ composed of the Unicode sequence U+0BB8 U+0BCD U+0BB0 U+0BC0; but this is discouraged by the Unicode standard.

<text>Dolfi or Dolphi Trost (1916 in Brăila – 1966 in Chicago, Illinois) was a Romanian surrealist poet, artist, and theorist, and the instigator of entopic graphomania. Together with Gherasim Luca, he was the author of &quot;Dialectique de la dialectique&quot; (1945). He also authored a work entitled &quot;Le même du même&quot;.

He also wrote the book, &quot;Vision dans le cristal. Oniromancie obsessionelle. Et neuf graphomanies entoptiques.&quot; as part of his surrealist art theory.

In 1941, Trost and Luca were among the founders of the Bucharest group of surrealists, which also included Gellu Naum, Paul Păun, and Virgil Theodorescu.

<text>Conscription evasion or draft evasion (American English) is any successful attempt to elude a government-imposed obligation to serve in the military forces of one&#x27;s nation. Sometimes draft evasion involves refusing to comply with the military draft laws of one&#x27;s nation. Illegal draft evasion is said to have characterized every military conflict of the 20th and 21st centuries, in which at least one party of such conflict has enforced conscription. Such evasion is generally considered to be a criminal offense, and laws against it go back thousands of years.

There are many draft evasion practices. Those that manage to adhere to or circumvent the law, and those that do not involve taking a public stand, are sometimes referred to as draft avoidance. Draft evaders are sometimes pejoratively referred to as draft dodgers, although in certain contexts that term has also been used non-judgmentally or as an honorific.

Practices that involve lawbreaking or taking a public stand are sometimes referred to as draft resistance. Although draft resistance is discussed below as a form of &quot;draft evasion&quot;, draft resisters and scholars of draft resistance reject the categorization of resistance as a form of evasion or avoidance. Draft resisters argue that they seek to confront, not evade or avoid, the draft.

Draft evasion has been a significant phenomenon in nations as different as Colombia, Eritrea, Canada, France, Russia, South Korea, Syria, Ukraine and the United States. Accounts by scholars and journalists, along with memoiristic writings by draft evaders, indicate that the motives and beliefs of the evaders cannot be usefully stereotyped.

==Draft evasion practices==

Young people have engaged in a wide variety of draft evasion practices around the world, some of which date back thousands of years. This section aims to delineate a representative sampling of draft evasion practices and support activities as identified by scholars and journalists. Examples of many of these practices and activities can be found in the section on draft evasion in the nations of the world, further down this page.

===Draft avoidance===
One type of draft avoidance consists of attempts to follow the letter and spirit of the draft laws in order to obtain a legally valid draft deferment or exemption. Sometimes these deferments and exemptions are prompted by political considerations. Another type consists of attempts to circumvent, manipulate, or surreptitiously violate the substance or spirit of the draft laws in order to obtain a deferment or exemption. Nearly all attempts at draft avoidance are private and unpublicized. Examples include:

====By adhering to the law====

* Claiming conscientious objector status on the basis of sincerely held religious or ethical beliefs.
* Claiming a student deferment, when one is in school primarily in order to study and learn.
* Claiming a medical or psychological problem, if the purported health issue is genuine and serious.
* Claiming to be homosexual, when one is truly so and the military excludes homosexuals.
* Claiming economic hardship, if the hardship is genuine and the law recognizes such a claim.
* Holding a job in what the government considers to be an essential civilian occupation.
* Purchasing exemptions from military service, in nations where such payments are permitted.
* Not being chosen in a draft lottery, where lotteries determine the order of call to military service; or not being in a certain age group, where age determines the order of call.
* Not being able to afford armor or other equipment, in polities where conscripts were required to provide their own.

====By circumventing the law====

* Obtaining conscientious objector status by professing insincere religious or ethical beliefs.
* Obtaining a student deferment, if the student wishes to attend or remain in school largely to avoid the draft.
* Claiming a medical or psychological problem, if the purported problem is feigned, overstated, or self-inflicted.
* Finding a doctor who would certify a healthy draft-age person as medically unfit, either willingly or for pay.
* Falsely claiming to be homosexual, where the military excludes homosexuals.
* Claiming economic hardship, if the purported hardship is overstated.
* Deliberately failing one&#x27;s military-related intelligence tests.
* Becoming pregnant primarily in order to evade the draft, in nations where women who are not mothers are drafted.
* Having someone exert personal influence on an officer in charge of the conscription process.
* Successfully bribing an officer in charge of the conscription process.

===Draft resistance===

Draft evasion that involves overt lawbreaking or that communicates conscious or organized resistance to government policy is sometimes referred to as draft resistance. Examples include:

====Actions by resisters====
* Declining to register for the draft, in nations where that is required by law.
* Declining to report for one&#x27;s draft-related physical examination, or for military induction or call-up, in nations where these are required by law.
* Participating in draft card burnings or turn-ins.
* Living &quot;underground&quot; (e.g., living with false identification papers) and working at an unreported job after being indicted for draft evasion.
* Traveling or emigrating to another country, rather than submitting to induction or to trial.
* Going to jail, rather than submitting to induction or to alternative government service.
* Shooting and/or killing draft officers and civil authorities.

====Actions by supporters or resisters====

* Organizing or participating in a peaceful street assembly or demonstration against the draft.
* Publicly encouraging, aiding, or abetting draft evaders.
* Deliberately disrupting a military draft agency&#x27;s processes or procedures.
* Destroying a military draft agency&#x27;s records.
* Organizing or participating in a riot against the draft.
* Building an anti-war movement that treats draft resistance as a vital and integral part of it.

==By country==
Draft evasion is said to have characterized every military conflict of the 20th and 21st centuries. Laws against certain draft evasion practices go back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Examples of draft evasion can be found in many nations over many time periods:

===Belgium===
19th-century Belgium was one of the few places where most citizens accepted the practice of legally buying one&#x27;s way out of the military draft, sometimes referred to as the practice of &quot;purchasable military commutation&quot;. Even so, some Belgian politicians denounced it as a system that appeared to trade the money of the rich for the lives of the poor.

===Britain===
In January 1916, during World War I, the British government passed a military conscription bill. By July of that year, 30% of draftees had failed to report for service.

===Canada===
Canada employed a military draft during World Wars I and II, and some Canadians chose to evade it. According to Canadian historian Jack Granatstein, &quot;no single issue has divided Canadians so sharply&quot; as the military draft. During both World Wars, political parties collapsed or were torn apart over the draft issue, and ethnicity seeped into the equation, with most French Canadians opposing conscription and a majority of English Canadians accepting it. During both wars, riots and draft evasion followed the passage of the draft laws. 

====World War I====

Conscription had been a dividing force in Canadian politics during World War I, and those divisions led to the Conscription Crisis of 1917. Canadians objected to conscription for diverse reasons: some thought it unnecessary, some did not identify with the British, and some felt it imposed unfair burdens on economically struggling segments of society. When the first draft class (single men between 20 and 34 years of age) was called up in 1917, nearly 281,000 of the approximately 404,000 men filed for exemptions. Throughout the war, some Canadians who feared conscription left for the United States or elsewhere.

====World War II====
Canada introduced an innovative kind of draft law in 1940 with the National Resources Mobilization Act. While the move was not unpopular outside French Canada, controversy arose because under the new law, conscripts were not compelled to serve outside Canada. They could choose simply to defend the country against invasion. By the middle of the war, many Canadians – not least of all, conscripts committed to overseas service – were referring to NRMA men pejoratively as &quot;Zombies&quot;, that is, as dead-to-life or utterly useless. Following costly fighting in Italy, Normandy, and the Scheldt, overseas Canadian troops were depleted, and during the Conscription Crisis of 1944 a one-time levy of approximately 17,000 NRMA men was sent to fight abroad. Many NRMA men deserted after the levy rather than fight abroad. One brigade of NRMA men declared itself on &quot;strike&quot; after the levy.

The number of men who actively sought to evade the World War II draft in Canada is not known. Granatstein says the evasion was &quot;widespread&quot;. In addition, in 1944 alone approximately 60,000 draftees were serving only as NRMA men, committed to border defense but not to fighting abroad.

===Colombia===
Colombia maintains a large and well-funded military, often focused on counter-insurgency. There is an obligatory military draft for all young men. Nevertheless, according to Public Radio International, two types of draft evasion are widespread in Colombia; one is prevalent among the relatively well-off, and another is found among the poor.

Young men from the middle-to-upper classes &quot;usually&quot; evade the Colombian draft. They do so by obtaining college or medical deferments, or by paying bribes for a &quot;military ID card&quot; certifying they have served – a card that is often requested by potential employers.

Young men from poorer circumstances sometimes simply avoid showing up for the draft and attempt to function without a military ID card. Besides facing limited employment prospects, these men are vulnerable to being forced into service through periodic army sweeps of poor neighborhoods.

===Eritrea===
Eritrea instituted a military draft in 1995. Three years later, it became open-ended; everyone under 50 [sic] can be enlisted for an indefinite period of time. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;release can depend on the arbitrary whim of a commander, and usually takes years&quot;.

It is illegal for Eritreans to leave the country without government permission. Nevertheless, in the mid-2010s around 2,000 Eritreans were leaving every month, &quot;primarily to avoid the draft&quot;, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;. Human rights groups and the United Nations have also claimed that Eritrea&#x27;s draft policies are fueling the migration. Most leave for Europe or neighboring countries; in 2015, Eritreans were the fourth largest group illicitly crossing the Mediterranean for Europe.

Mothers are usually excused from the Eritrean draft. &quot;The Economist&quot; says that, as a result, pregnancies among single women – once a taboo in Eritrea – have increased.

A 2018 article in Bloomberg News reported that Eritrea was considering altering some of its military draft policies.

===Finland===
During World War II, there was no legal way to avoid the draft, and failure to obey was treated as insubordination or desertion, punished by execution or jail. Draft evaders were forced to escape to the forests and live there as outlaws, in a practice that was facetiously called serving in the &quot;käpykaarti&quot; (Pine Cone Guard) or &quot;metsäkaarti&quot; (Forest Guard).

Approximately 1,500 men failed to show up for the draft at the start of the Continuation War (1941–1944, pitting Finland against the Soviet Union), and 32,186 cases of desertion were handled by the courts. There were numerous reasons for draft evasion and desertion during this period: fear or war-weariness, objection to the war as an offensive war, ideological objections or outright support for Communism. Finnish Communists were considered dangerous and could not serve, and were subject to &quot;protective custody&quot; – in practice, detention in a prison for the course of the war – because earlier attempts to conscript them had ended in disaster: one battalion called &quot;Pärmin pataljoona&quot; assembled from detained Communists suffered a large-scale defection to the Soviet side.

The &quot;käpykaarti&quot; (forest-dwelling Pine Cone Guard, mentioned above) was a diverse group including draft evaders, deserters, Communists, and Soviet desants (military skydivers). They lived in small groups, sometimes even in military-style dugouts constructed from logs, and often maintained a rotation to guard their camps. They received support from sympathizers who could buy from the black market; failing that, they stole provisions to feed themselves. The Finnish Army and police actively searched for them, and if discovered, a firefight often ensued. The Finnish Communist Party was able to operate among draft evaders. Sixty-three death sentences were handed out to deserters; however, many of them were killed in military or police raids on their camps. Deserters captured near front lines would often be simply returned to the lines, but as the military situation deteriorated towards the end of the war, punishments were harsher: 61 of the death sentences given were in 1944, mostly in June and July during the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, where Finnish forces were forced to retreat.

At the conclusion of the war, the Allied Control Commission immediately demanded an amnesty for draft evaders, and they were not further punished.

As of 2020, deliberate draft evasion is a rare phenomenon, since absence from a drafting event, in most cases, leads to an immediate search warrant. Evaders are taken by police officers to the draft board, or to the regional military office.

===France===
In France, the right of all draftees to purchase military exemption – introduced after the French Revolution – was abolished in 1870. One scholar refers to the permissible buy-out as a &quot;bastard form of equality&quot; that bore traces of the Ancien Régime.

====Napoleonic era====
Draft evasion was a big problem for the French military under Napoleon. Near the start of the Napoleonic Era (encompassing the Napoleonic Wars), it was estimated that about 200,000 people had either evaded a draft or deserted from the military, due to the surge in conscription; possibly facing harsh consequences. Around 1808, in the middle of the military conflict, the number was closer to 500,000. Around this time period, a gendarmerie was assembled, aiming to hunt for the people who deserted the military or dodged drafts; the French also enforced the mandatory carrying of passports, among other measures.

===Israel===
There has always been a military draft in Israel. It is universal for all non-Arab Israeli citizens, men and women alike, and can legally be evaded only on physical or psychological grounds or by strictly Orthodox Jews, although the Israeli Supreme Court ruled to reject the latter exception in June 2024. The draft has become part of the fabric of Israeli society: according to &quot;Le Monde&quot; senior editor Sylvain Cypel, Israel is a place where military service is seen not just as a duty but a &quot;certificate of entry into active life&quot;.

Yet by the middle of the decade of the 2000s, draft evasion (including outright draft refusal) and desertion had reached all-time highs. Fully 5% of young men and 3% of young women were supposedly failing their pre-military psychological tests, both all-time highs. Some popular entertainers, including rock star Aviv Geffen, grand-nephew of military hero Moshe Dayan, have been encouraging draft evasion (Geffen publicly said he would commit suicide if he were taken by the military). In 2007 the Israeli government initiated what some called a &quot;shaming campaign&quot;, banning young entertainers from holding concerts and making television appearances if they failed to fulfill their military requirement. By 2008 over 3,000 high school students belonged to &quot;Shministim&quot; (Hebrew for twelfth graders), a group of young people claiming to be conscientiously opposed to military service. American actor Ed Asner wrote a column supporting the group. Another group, New Profile, was started by Israeli peace activists to encourage draft refusal.

University of Manchester sociologist Yulia Zemilinskaya has interviewed members of New Profile and Shministim, along with members of two groups of Israeli soldiers and reservists who have expressed an unwillingness to engage in missions they disapprove of – Yesh Gvul and Courage to Refuse. Despite commonalities, she found a difference between the draft refusers and the military selective-refusers:

The analysis of these interviews demonstrated that, in their appeal to [the] Israeli public, members of Yesh Gvul and Courage to Refuse utilized symbolic meanings and codes derived from dominant militarist and nationalist discourses. In contrast, draft-resisters, members of New Profile and Shministim, refusing to manipulate nationalistic and militaristic codes, voice a much more radical and comprehensive critique of the state’s war making plans. Invoking feminist, anti-militarist and pacifist ideologies, they openly challenge and criticize dominant militarist and Zionist discourses. While the majority of members of Yesh Gvul and Courage to Refuse choose selective refusal, negotiating conditions of their reserve duty, [the] anti-militarist, pacifist, and feminist ideological stance of members of New Profile and Shministim leads them to absolutist refusal.

===Russia/Soviet Union===

According to London-based journalist Elisabeth Braw, writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, draft evasion was &quot;endemic&quot; in the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War, which ended with Soviet defeat in 1989. A declassified Central Intelligence Agency report revealed that the Soviet elite routinely bribed its sons&#x27; way out of deployment to Afghanistan, or out of military service altogether.

In Russia, all men aged 18 through 30 are subject to the military draft, continuing the Soviet practice. According to a report from the European Parliamentary Research Service, an organ of the Secretariat of the European Parliament, in the mid-2010s fully half of the 150,000 young men called up each year were thought to be evading the draft. During Dmitry Medvedev&#x27;s presidency, the service duration was reduced from two years to one.

====Invasion of Ukraine====
In September 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine over 600,000 mobilization-eligible citizens left the country to avoid the draft. Reportedly, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia became primary, visa-free destinations for Russians seeking to avoid President Vladimir Putin’s mobilization order. Finland, Poland and the Baltic countries announced they will not offer refuge to Russians fleeing mobilization.

In January 2023, Kazakhstan announced they were tightening visa rules, a move that is expected to make it more difficult for Russians to remain in the country. Kazakhstan said it would extradite Russians wanted for evading mobilization. In early 2023, the Biden administration resumed deportations of Russians who had fled Russia due to mobilization and political persecution. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan agreed to share personal data of Russians fleeing mobilization.

===South Korea===
South Korea maintains mandatory military service. According to the &quot;Korea JoongAng Daily&quot;, since the early 2000s, the country has been rocked by scandals involving celebrities who try to use their fame to evade the draft or receive special treatment from the military. South Koreans are reportedly so hostile to draft evasion that one South Korean commentator said that it is &quot;almost like suicide&quot; for celebrities to engage in it. Yoo Seung-jun was one of the biggest stars on the South Korean rock scene until 2002, when he chose to evade the draft and become a U.S. citizen. South Korea subsequently deported him and banned him for life.

Some South Korean draft evaders have been sentenced to prison. In 2014, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; ran a headline claiming that South Korea had the &quot;most draft dodgers in prison&quot;. The article, by veteran correspondent Donald Kirk, explained that South Korea&#x27;s government did not allow for conscientious objection to war; as a result, 669 mostly religiously motivated South Koreans were said to be in jail for draft evasion in 2013. Only 723 draft evaders were said to be in jail worldwide at that time.

According to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; (Hong Kong), in June 2013 Lee Yeda became the first South Korean to be granted asylum specifically because he evaded the South Korean draft. His asylum claim was granted by France. &quot;[In South] Korea, it is ... difficult to find a job for anyone who has not completed their national service,&quot; Lee was reported to have said. &quot;Refusing to serve means that, in society, your life is terminated.&quot;

===Syria===

Syria requires men over 18 to serve in the army for two years (except for college graduates, who need serve only 18 months). Draft evasion carries stiff punishments, including fines and years of imprisonment. After the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011, many draft-age men began fleeing the country, sometimes paying thousands of dollars to be smuggled out. Others paid to have their names expunged from the draft rolls. Meanwhile, the government erected billboards exhorting young people to join the army – and set up road checkpoints to capture draft evaders. By 2016, an estimated 70,000 draft evaders had left Syria, and others remained undetected within its borders.

Observers have identified several motives among the Syrian draft evaders. One is fear of dying in that country&#x27;s civil war. Others include obeying parental wishes and disgust with the government of Bashar al-Assad. , a professor of migration law at VU University Amsterdam, has argued that Syrian draft evaders motivated by a refusal to participate in violations of international law should be given refugee status by other nations.

In October 2018, the Syrian government announced an amnesty for draft evaders. However, an officer with Syria&#x27;s &quot;Reconciliation Ministry&quot; told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that, while punishment would be canceled, military service would still be required. &quot;Now the war is practically at its end, which means enlisting is no longer such a fearful situation&quot;, he said. &quot;We expect we&#x27;ll have very large numbers taking advantage of the amnesty&quot;.

===Tunisia===
Tunisia has had a draft since gaining its independence in 1956. Most males are required to submit documents to local officials at age 18 and to begin service two years later. However, according to the Lebanon-based Carnegie Middle East Center, the Tunisian draft has long been poorly enforced and draft evasion has long been rampant.

In order to minimize draft evasion, Tunisia began allowing young men to substitute &quot;civilian&quot; service (such as working on rural development projects) or &quot;national&quot; service (such as working as civil servants) for military service. But that has not helped: the defense minister reported that, in 2017, only 506 young men turned up out of an eligibility pool of more than 31,000.

===Ukraine===

In 2015, responding to perceived threats from pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian military instituted a compulsory draft for males between 20 and 27 years of age. However, according to independent journalist Alec Luhn, writing in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, a &quot;huge number&quot; of Ukrainians refused to serve. Luhn gives three reasons for this. One was fear of death. Another was that some young Ukrainians were opposed to war in general. A third was that some were unwilling to take up arms against those whom they perceived to be their countrymen.

The Ukrainian military itself has stated that, during a partial call-up in 2014, over 85,000 men failed to report to their draft offices, and nearly 10,000 of those were eventually declared to be illegal draft evaders.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine. Despite the ban on leaving Ukraine, an estimated 600,000–850,000 Ukrainian men fled to Europe after the Russian invasion. The Polish government offered, and the Lithuanian government considered, the repatriation of Ukrainian men living in their countries to Ukraine.

===United States===
The United States has employed a draft several times, usually during war but also during the Cold War. Each time the draft has been met with at least some resistance.

In &quot;Sketches of America&quot; (1818) British author Henry Bradshaw Fearon, who visited the young United States on a fact-finding mission to inform Britons considering emigration, described the New York Guard—although he did not name it—as he found it in New York City in August 1817:

Every male inhabitant can be called out, from the age of 18 to 45, on actual military duty. During a state of peace, there are seven musters annually: the fine for non-attendance is, each time, five dollars. Commanding officers have discretionary power to receive substitutes. An instance of their easiness to be pleased was related to me by Mr. —, a tradesman of this city. He never attends the muster, but, to avoid the fine, sends some of his men, who answer to his name; the same man is not invariably his deputy on parade: in this, Mr. — suits his own convenience; sometimes the collecting clerk, sometimes one of the brewers, at others a drayman: and to finish this military pantomime, a firelock is often dispensed with, for the more convenient wartime weapon—a cudgel. Courts-martial have the power of mitigating the fine, on the assignment of a satisfactory cause of absence, and in cases of poverty. Upon legal exemptions I cannot convey certain information. During a period of three months in the late war, martial law existed, and no substitutes were received. Aliens were not called out.

====Civil War====

Both the Union (the North) and the Confederacy (the South) instituted drafts during the American Civil War – and both drafts were often evaded. In the North, evaders were most numerous among poor Irish immigrants. In the South, evaders were most numerous in hill country and in certain other parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia.

Resistance to the draft was sometimes violent. In the North, nearly 100 draft enrollment officers were injured in attacks. Anti-draft riots in New York City in 1863 lasted several days and resulted in up to 120 deaths and 2,000 injuries.

According to historian David Williams, by 1864 the Southern draft had become virtually unenforceable. Some believe that draft evasion in the South, where manpower was scarcer than in the North, contributed to the Confederate defeat.

====World War I====
The Selective Service Act of 1917 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples and by prohibiting all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. In 1917 and 1918 some 24 million men were registered and nearly 3 million inducted into the military services, with little of the overt resistance that characterized the Civil War.

In the United States during World War I, the word &quot;slacker&quot; was commonly used to describe someone who was not participating in the war effort, especially someone who avoided military service, an equivalent of the later term &quot;draft dodger.&quot; Attempts to track down such evaders were called &quot;slacker raids.&quot; Under the Espionage Act of 1917, activists including Eugene V. Debs and Emma Goldman were arrested for speaking out against the draft.

Despite such circumstances, draft evasion was substantial. According to one scholar, nearly 11 percent of the draft-eligible population refused to register, or to report for induction; according to another, 12 percent of draftees either failed to report to their training camps or deserted from them. A significant amount of draft evasion took place in the South, in part because many impoverished Southerners lacked documentation and in part because many Southerners recalled the &quot;horrible carnage&quot; of the Civil War. In 2017, historian Michael Kazin concluded that a greater percentage of American men evaded the draft during World War I than during the Vietnam War.

====World War II====
According to scholar Anna Wittmann, about 72,000 young Americans applied for conscientious objector (CO) status during World War II, and many of their applications were rejected. Some COs chose to serve as noncombatants in the military, others chose jail, and a third group – taking a position in between – chose to enter a specially organized domestic Civilian Public Service.

====Korean War====
The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, generated 80,000 cases of alleged draft evasion.

====Vietnam War====

The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was controversial in the US and was accompanied by a significant amount of draft evasion among young Americans, with many managing to remain in the U.S. by various means and some eventually leaving for Canada or elsewhere.

Significant draft avoidance was taking place even before the US became heavily involved in the Vietnam War. The large cohort of Baby Boomers allowed for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college and graduate students. According to peace studies scholar David Cortright, &quot;more than half&quot; of the 27 million men eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War were deferred, exempted, or disqualified.

The number of draft resisters was also significant. According to Cortright, &quot;Distinct from the millions who [avoided] the draft were the many thousands who resisted the conscription system and actively opposed the war&quot;. The head of US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s task force on the all-volunteer military reported in 1970 that the number of resisters was &quot;expanding at an alarming rate&quot; and that the government was &quot;almost powerless to apprehend and prosecute them&quot;. It is now known that, during the Vietnam era, approximately 570,000 young men were classified as draft offenders, and approximately 210,000 were formally accused of draft violations; however, only 8,750 were convicted and only 3,250 were jailed. Some draft eligible men publicly burned their draft cards, but the Justice Department brought charges against only 50, of whom 40 were convicted.

As US troop strength in Vietnam increased, some young men sought to evade the draft by pro-actively enlisting in military forces that were unlikely to see combat in Vietnam. For example, conscription scholars Lawrence Baskir and William Strauss say that the Coast Guard may have served that purpose for some, though they also point out that Coast Guardsmen had to maintain readiness for combat in Vietnam, and that some Coast Guardsmen eventually served and were killed there. Similarly, the Vietnam-era National Guard was seen by some as an avenue for avoiding combat in Vietnam, although that too was less than foolproof: about 15,000 National Guardsmen were sent to Vietnam before the war began winding down.

Other young men sought to evade the draft by avoiding or resisting any military commitment. In this they were bolstered by certain countercultural figures. &quot;Draft Dodger Rag&quot;, a 1965 song by Phil Ochs, employed satire to provide a how-to list of available deferments: ruptured spleen, poor eyesight, flat feet, asthma, and many more. Folksinger Arlo Guthrie lampooned the paradox of seeking a deferment by acting crazy in his song &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;: &quot;I said, &#x27;I wanna kill! Kill! Eat dead burnt bodies!&#x27; and the Sergeant said, &#x27;You&#x27;re our boy&#x27;!&quot; The book &quot;1001 Ways to Beat the Draft&quot; was co-authored by Tuli Kupferberg, a member of the band The Fugs. It espoused such methods as arriving at the draft board in diapers. Another text pertinent to draft-age men was Jules Feiffer&#x27;s cartoon novella from the 1950s, &quot;Munro&quot;, later a short film, in which a four-year-old boy is drafted by mistake.

Draft counseling groups were another source of support for potential draft evaders. Many such groups were active during the war. Some were connected to national groups, such as the American Friends Service Committee and Students for a Democratic Society; others were ad hoc campus or community groups. Many specially trained individuals worked as counselors for such groups.

Alongside the draft counseling groups, a substantial draft resistance movement emerged. Students for a Democratic Society sought to play a major role in it, as did the War Resisters League, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee&#x27;s &quot;National Black Anti-War Anti-Draft Union&quot; and other groups. Many say that the draft resistance movement was spearheaded by an organization called The Resistance. It was founded by David Harris and others in the San Francisco Bay Area in March 1967, and quickly spread nationally. The insignia of the organization was the Greek letter omega, Ω, the symbol for ohms—the unit of electrical resistance. Members of The Resistance publicly burned their draft cards or refused to register for the draft. Other members deposited their cards into boxes on selected dates and then mailed them to the government. They were then drafted, refused to be inducted, and fought their cases in the federal courts. These draft resisters hoped that their public civil disobedience would help to bring the war and the draft to an end. Many young men went to federal prison as part of this movement. According to Cortright, the draft resistance movement was the leading edge of the anti-war movement in 1967 and 1968.

After the war, some of the draft evaders who stayed in the U.S. wrote memoirs. These included David Harris&#x27;s &quot;Dreams Die Hard&quot; (1982), David Miller&#x27;s &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know God Made Honky Tonk Communists&quot; (2001), Jerry Elmer&#x27;s &quot;Felon for Peace&quot; (2005), and Bruce Dancis&#x27;s &quot;Resister&quot; (2014). Harris was an anti-draft organizer who went to jail for his beliefs (and was briefly married to folk singer Joan Baez), Miller was the first Vietnam War refuser to publicly burn his draft card (and later became partner to spiritual teacher Starhawk), Elmer refused to register for the draft and destroyed draft board files in several locations, and Dancis led the largest chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (the one at Cornell University) before being jailed for publicly shredding his draft card and returning it to his draft board. Harris in particular expresses serious second thoughts about aspects of the movement he was part of.

Canadian historian Jessica Squires emphasizes that the number of U.S. draft evaders coming to Canada was &quot;only a fraction&quot; of those who resisted the Vietnam War. According to a 1978 book by former members of President Gerald Ford&#x27;s Clemency Board, 210,000 Americans were accused of draft offenses and 30,000 left the country. More recently, Cortright estimated that 60,000 to 100,000 left the US, mainly for Canada or Sweden. Others scattered elsewhere; for example, historian Frank Kusch mentions Mexico, scholar Anna Wittmann mentions Britain, and journalist Jan Wong describes one draft evader who sympathized with Mao Zedong&#x27;s China and found refuge there. Draft evader Ken Kiask spent eight years traveling continuously across the Global South before returning to the US


The number of Vietnam-era draft evaders leaving for Canada is hotly contested; an entire book, by scholar Joseph Jones, has been written on that subject. In 2017, University of Toronto professor Robert McGill cited estimates by four scholars, including Jones, ranging from a floor of 30,000 to a ceiling of 100,000, depending in part on who is being counted as a draft evader.

Though the presence of U.S. draft evaders and deserters in Canada was initially controversial, the Canadian government eventually chose to welcome them. Draft evasion was not a criminal offense under Canadian law. The issue of deserters was more complex. Desertion from the US military was not on the list of crimes for which a person could be extradited under the extradition treaty between Canada and the US; however, desertion was a crime in Canada, and the Canadian military strongly opposed condoning it. In the end, the Canadian government maintained the right to prosecute these deserters, but in practice left them alone and instructed border guards not to ask questions relating to the issue.

In Canada, many American Vietnam War evaders received pre-emigration counseling and post-emigration assistance from locally based groups. Typically these consisted of American emigrants and Canadian supporters. The largest were the Montreal Council to Aid War Resisters, the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, and the Vancouver Committee to Aid American War Objectors. Journalists often noted their effectiveness. The &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot;, published jointly by the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme and the House of Anansi Press, sold nearly 100,000 copies, and one sociologist found that the &quot;Manual&quot; had been read by over 55% of his data sample of US Vietnam War emigrants either before or after they arrived in Canada. In addition to the counseling groups (and at least formally separate from them) was a Toronto-based political organization, the Union of American Exiles, better known as &quot;Amex.&quot; It sought to speak for American draft evaders and deserters in Canada. For example, it lobbied and campaigned for universal, unconditional amnesty, and hosted an international conference in 1974 opposing anything short of that.

Those who went abroad faced imprisonment or forced military service if they returned home. In September 1974, President Gerald Ford offered an amnesty program for draft dodgers that required them to work in alternative service occupations for periods of six to 24 months. In 1977, one day after his inauguration, President Jimmy Carter fulfilled a campaign promise by offering pardons to anyone who had evaded the draft and requested one. It antagonized critics on both sides, with the right complaining that those pardoned paid no penalty and the left complaining that requesting a pardon required the admission of a crime.


It remains a matter of debate whether emigration to Canada and elsewhere during the Vietnam War was an effective, or even a genuine, war resistance strategy. Scholar Michael Foley argues that it was not only relatively ineffective, but that it served to siphon off disaffected young Americans from the larger struggle. Activists Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden reportedly held similar views. By contrast, authors John Hagan and Roger N. Williams recognize the American emigrants as &quot;war resisters&quot; in the subtitles of their books about the emigrants, and &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; author Mark Satin contended that public awareness of tens of thousands of young Americans leaving for Canada would – and eventually did – help end the war.

Some draft evaders returned to the U.S. from Canada after the 1977 pardon, but according to sociologist John Hagan, about half of them stayed on. This young and mostly educated population expanded Canada&#x27;s arts and academic scenes, and helped push Canadian politics further to the left, though some Canadians, including some principled nationalists, found their presence or impact troubling. American draft evaders who left for Canada and became prominent there include author William Gibson, politician Jim Green, gay rights advocate Michael Hendricks, attorney Jeffry House, author Keith Maillard, playwright John Murrell, television personality Eric Nagler, film critic Jay Scott, and musician Jesse Winchester. Other draft evaders from the Vietnam era remain in Sweden and elsewhere.

Two academic literary critics have written at length about autobiographical novels by draft evaders who went to Canada – Rachel Adams in the &quot;Yale Journal of Criticism&quot; and Robert McGill in a book from McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press. Both critics discuss Morton Redner&#x27;s &quot;Getting Out&quot; (1971) and Mark Satin&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of a Young Exile&quot; (1976), and Adams also discusses Allen Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Dropping Out in 3/4 Time&quot; (1972) and Daniel Peters&#x27;s &quot;Border Crossing&quot; (1978). All these books portray their protagonists&#x27; views, motives, activities, and relationships in detail. Adams says they contain some surprises:

It is to be expected that the draft dodgers denounce the state as an oppressive bureaucracy, using the vernacular of the time to rail against &quot;the machine&quot; and &quot;the system.&quot; What is more surprising is their general resistance to mass movements, a sentiment that contradicts the association of the draft dodger with sixties protest found in more recent work by [Scott] Turow or [Mordecai] Richler. In contrast to stereotypes, the draft dodger in these narratives is neither an unthinking follower of movement ideology nor a radical who attempts to convert others to his cause. ... [Another surprise is that the dodgers] have little interest in romantic love. Their libidinal hyperactivity accords with [Herbert] Marcuse&#x27;s belief in the liberatory power of eros. They are far less worried about whether particular relationships will survive the flight to Canada than about the gratification of their immediate sexual urges.

Later memoirs by Vietnam-era draft evaders who went to Canada include Donald Simons&#x27;s &quot;I Refuse&quot; (1992), George Fetherling&#x27;s &quot;Travels by Night&quot; (1994), and Mark Frutkin&#x27;s &quot;Erratic North&quot; (2008).

=====Prominent people arguably manipulating the system=====
For decades after the Vietnam War ended, prominent Americans were being accused of having manipulated the draft system to their advantage.

According to a column by E. J. Dionne in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, by 2006 politicians whom opponents had accused of improperly avoiding the draft included George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Bill Clinton.

In a 1970s &quot;High Times&quot; article, American singer-songwriter Ted Nugent stated that he took crystal meth, and urinated and defecated in his pants before his physical, in order to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War. In a 1990 interview with a large Detroit newspaper, Nugent made similar statements.

Actor and comedian Chevy Chase also misled his draft board. In 1989, approximately two decades after the fact, Chase revealed on a television talk show that he avoided the Vietnam War by making several false claims to his draft board, including that he harbored homosexual tendencies. He added he was &quot;not very proud&quot; of having done that. Several politically charged books subsequently discussed Chase&#x27;s behavior.

Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh avoided the Vietnam draft because of anal cysts. In a 2011 book critical of Limbaugh, journalist John K. Wilson accused Limbaugh making &quot;hyperbolic attacks on foreign policy&quot;.

Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney&#x27;s deferment has been questioned. The LDS Church eventually agreed to cap the number of missionary deferments it sought for members in any one region. After Romney dropped out of Stanford University and was about to lose his student deferment, he decided to become a missionary; and the LDS Church in his home state of Michigan chose to give him one of that state&#x27;s missionary deferments. In a &quot;Salon&quot; article from 2007, journalist Joe Conason noted that Romney&#x27;s father had been governor of Michigan at the time.

Attention has also been paid to independent Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27;s failure to serve. In an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, it was reported that, after graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, and moving back to New York City, the future candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination applied for conscientious objector status – even though as Sanders acknowledged to the reporter, he was not religious. (Sanders was opposed to the Vietnam War. At the time, however, CO status was granted entirely on the basis of religious opposition to all war.) Sanders&#x27;s CO status was denied. Nevertheless, a &quot;lengthy series of hearings, an FBI investigation and numerous postponements and delays&quot; took him to age 26 at which point he was no longer eligible for the draft. In a 2015 book critical of Sanders, journalist Harry Jaffe revisited that portion of the &quot;Atlantic&quot; article, emphasizing that by the time Sanders&#x27;s &quot;numerous hearings&quot; had run their course he was &quot;too old to be drafted&quot;.

U.S. president Donald Trump graduated from college in the spring of 1968, and became eligible for military service. Trump however, due to a personal friend of his father&#x27;s, a medical doctor, was granted a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels. The diagnosis allowed Trump to receive a medical deferment.

=====Pardons=====
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter issued a pardon giving unconditional amnesty to Vietnam war draft resisters.

==Larger issues==
The phenomenon of draft evasion has raised several major issues among scholars and others.

===Effectiveness===
One issue is the effectiveness of the various kinds of draft evasion practices with regard to ending a military draft or stopping a war. Historian Michael S. Foley sees many draft evasion practices as merely personally beneficial. In his view, only public anti-draft activity, consciously and collectively engaged in, is relevant to stopping a draft or a war. By contrast, sociologist Todd Gitlin is more generous in his assessment of the effectiveness of the entire gamut of draft evasion practices. Political scientist James C. Scott, although speaking more theoretically, makes a similar point, arguing that the accumulation of thousands upon thousands of &quot;petty&quot; and obscure acts of private resistance can trigger political change.

===Social class===

Another issue is how best to understand young people&#x27;s responses to a military call-up. According to historian Charles DeBenedetti, some Vietnam War opponents chose to evaluate people&#x27;s responses to the war largely in terms of their willingness to take personal responsibility to resist evil, a standard prompted by the Nuremberg doctrine. The &quot;Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada&quot; urged its readers to make their draft decision with Nuremberg in mind. By contrast, prominent journalist James Fallows is convinced that social class (rather than conscience or political conviction) was the dominant factor in determining who would fight in the war and who would evade their obligation to do so. Fallows writes of the shame he felt – and continued to feel – after he realized that his successful attempt at draft evasion (he brought his body weight below the minimum, and lied about his mental health), an attempt he prepared for with the help of sophisticated draft counselors and classmates at Harvard, meant that working-class kids from Boston would be going to Vietnam in his stead. He referred to this outcome as a matter of class discrimination and passionately argued against it. Fallows indicated that he might have felt differently about his behavior had he chosen public draft resistance, jail, or exile.

Historian Stanley Karnow has noted that, during the Vietnam War, student deferments themselves helped preserve class privilege: &quot;[President Lyndon] Johnson generously deferred U.S. college students from the draft to avoid alienating the American middle class&quot;.

===Democracy===
Historian Howard Zinn and political activist Tom Hayden saw at least some kinds of draft evasion as a positive expression of democracy. By contrast, historian and classical studies scholar Mathew R. Christ says that, in ancient democratic Athens, where draft evasion was ongoing, many of the popular tragic playwrights were deeply concerned about the corrosive effects of draft evasion on democracy and community. According to Christ, while many of these playwrights were sensitive to the moral dilemmas of war and the imperfections of Athenian democracy, most touted &quot;the ethical imperative that a man should support his friends and community. In serving the community, the individual does ... what is right and honorable&quot;.

<doc id="472221" wikidata="Q587046" url="?curid=472221" title="List of islands of Scotland">
<text>This is a list of islands of Scotland, the mainland of which is part of the island of Great Britain. Also included are various other related tables and lists. The definition of an offshore island used in this list is &quot;land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways&quot;.

Scotland has around 900 offshore islands, most of which are to be found in four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, sub-divided into the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are also clusters of islands in the Firth of Clyde, Firth of Forth, and Solway Firth, and numerous small islands within the many bodies of fresh water in Scotland including Loch Lomond and Loch Maree. The largest island is Lewis and Harris, which extends to , and there are a further 200 islands which are greater than in area. Of the remainder, several, such as Staffa and the Flannan Isles, are well-known, despite their small size. Some 94 Scottish islands are permanently inhabited, of which 89 are offshore islands. Between 2001 and 2011, Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

The geology and geomorphology of the islands is varied. Some, such as Skye and Mull, are mountainous, while others like Tiree and Sanday are relatively low-lying. Many have bedrock made from ancient Archaean Lewisian Gneiss which was formed 3 billion years ago; Shapinsay and other Orkney islands are formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is 400 million years old; and others such as Rùm from more recent Tertiary volcanoes. Many of the islands are swept by strong tides, and the Corryvreckan tide race between Scarba and Jura is one of the largest whirlpools in the world. Other strong tides are to be found in the Pentland Firth between mainland Scotland and Orkney, and another example is the &quot;Grey Dog&quot; between Scarba and Lunga.

The culture of the islands has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic-, Norse- and English-speaking peoples, and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Many of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names. A few have Brythonic, Scots and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.

A feature of modern life in the islands is the low crime rate, and they are considered to be among the safest places to live in Britain. Orkney was rated as the best place to live in Scotland in both 2013 and 2014, according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey.

Rockall is a small rocky islet in the North Atlantic which was declared part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972. However, despite no possession by any other state and other precedents, the legality of the claim is disputed by the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Iceland, and some say it may be unenforceable in international law.

==Demographics==

The 2011 census records 94 Scottish islands as having a usually resident population, of which 89 are offshore islands. There are however various complications with both the definitions of an &quot;island&quot; and occasional habitation; and the National Records of Scotland also list a further 17 islands that were inhabited in 2001 but not in 2011, or are &quot;included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses&quot;. There are a small number of other islands that are evidently inhabited but which are not recorded in this list.

The local government council areas with the most inhabited islands are Argyll and Bute with 23, Orkney with 20, Shetland with 16 and Highland and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar with 14 each. There are also three in North Ayrshire and one each in Fife, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire. The last three named plus two islands in Argyll and Bute are freshwater rather than offshore.

In the past many smaller islands that are uninhabited today had permanent populations. Losses were severe in many areas during the 19th century when islands such as Pabbay and Fuaigh Mòr were subject to forcible evictions during the Highland Clearances. Mass emigration from the Hebridean islands was at its height in the mid-19th century but it commenced as early as the 1770s in some areas. The crofting counties held 20% of Scotland&#x27;s population in 1755 but by 1961 this figure had declined to 5%. Other examples are Mingulay, Noss and the St Kilda archipelago, which were abandoned during the course of the 20th century. Declines have been particularly significant in the more remote outlying islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses.

The following table shows population trends for the ten most populous islands as of the 2011 census. The overall trends are typically growth in populations in the early part of the modern period, followed by declines from the mid 19th century onwards. In every case except Orkney the highest population was recorded prior to 1932 and the lowest post-Industrial Revolution figure after 1960. Subsequently, there has been modest growth overall, although some islands are continuing to show a decline. Between 1991 and 2001, the population of the islands as a whole fell by 3% to 99,739, although there were 35 islands whose population increased. By contrast, between 2001 and 2011 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The Scottish Community Alliance noted that &quot;the largest rate of increase has been in the Western Isles (6%) where local people now own approximately 60% of the landmass. Where populations have fallen (Bute, Arran and Islay) community ownership is virtually non-existent.&quot;

===Largest Scottish islands by population===
The following table compares the populations of the main Scottish archipelagos with that of the Faroe Islands for a similar time frame to the above.

==Legislation==
In July 2013, the Scottish Government made the Lerwick Declaration, indicating an intention to decentralise power to the three island council areas of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles and later that year made a commitment to do so. In 2017 an Islands bill was introduced to make &quot;island proofing&quot; (including for uninhabited islands) a statutory requirement for public bodies. The Bill completed Stage 1 on 8 February 2018.

==Larger islands==
This is a list of Scottish islands that either have an area greater than 40 hectares (approximately 100 acres) and/or are inhabited. The main groups, from Haswell-Smith (2004), in many cases provide a more useful guide to location than local authority areas. These groups are: Firth of Clyde, Islay, Firth of Lorn, Mull, Small Isles, Skye, Lewis and Harris, Uists and Barra, St Kilda, Orkney, Shetland and Firth of Forth. In a few cases where the island is part of either a recognisable smaller group or an archipelago, or is located away from the main groups, an archipelago, local authority or other descriptive name is used instead. &quot;F&quot; designates a freshwater island.

Scotland&#x27;s islands include thirteen Munros (mountains with a height over 3,000 feet or 914.4 metres), twelve of them found on Skye, and a total of 227 Marilyns (hills with a relative height of at least 150 metres, regardless of absolute height).









Four islands were recorded as inhabited in 2011 that were not mentioned in the 2001 census: , , Holm of Grimbister and Inner Holm.

These following are listed by the National Records of Scotland as &quot;included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses.&quot; None except Lamb Holm are greater than 40 ha in area.

==Freshwater islands==
There are numerous other freshwater islands, of which the more notable include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf&#x27;s Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have played an important part in Scottish history.

Inchmurrin is the largest freshwater island in the British Isles. It is in Loch Lomond, which contains over sixty other islands. Loch Maree also contains several islands, the largest of which are Eilean Sùbhainn, Garbh Eilean and Eilean Ruairidh Mòr but aren&#x27;t as big as others.

==Smaller offshore islands==
This is a continuing list of uninhabited Scottish islands smaller than 40 hectares in size.

==Small archipelagos==

There are various small archipelagos which may be better known than the larger islands they contain. These include:
==Former islands==

The following is a list of places which were formerly islands, but which are no longer so due to silting up, harbour building etc.

*Ardeer Peninsula, North Ayrshire 
*Bodinbo Island near to Erskine on the River Clyde is now partly joined to the river bank.
*Broch of Clickimin is a former island in Loch of Clickimin, Lerwick, in Shetland. Originally an offshore island, the loch became cut off from the sea around 200 BC and the island is now connected to dry land by a permanent causeway.
* Bunglan was once a separate island, but is now connected to Samphrey by two tombolos.
* Eilean-a-beithich was once one of the Slate Islands and located in Easdale Sound. However, it was quarried to a depth of below sea level leaving only the outer rim of the island. This was eventually breached by the sea and little visible sign of the island now remains.
* Eilean Chaluim Chille is a former island near Kilmuir on Skye in a now drained loch that was associated with the 13th century Hebridean lord Páll, son of Bálki.
* Inchbroach, also known as Rossie Island, is now part of Montrose harbour.
* Inch of Culter is a former island in the River Dee near Maryculter.
* Innis Bheag or Paterson Island near Portmahomack in Easter Ross is now permanently attached to the Morrich More due to shifting sands.
* Keith Inch (not to be confused with Inchkeith), is now part of Peterhead Harbour, and is the easternmost point of mainland Scotland.
* King&#x27;s Inch on which stood Inch Castle.
* Milton Island or Green Inch was an island in the Clyde&#x27;s estuarine waters close to the old ford across the river at Dumbuck near Dumbarton.
* Newshot Island or Newshot Isle was an island of circa 50 acres or 20 hectares lying in the River Clyde close to Park Quay, Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is now partly joined to the river bank.
* North Inch, one of the &quot;Inches&quot; in Perth, formerly an island in the River Tay.
* Preston Island, an artificial construction south of Low Valleyfield, has now been fully reclaimed, using ash slurry from Longannet power station.
* Rosyth Castle also stands on what was once a tidal island in the Firth of Forth, now surrounded by reclaimed land.
* Sand Inch was a small island in the River Clyde next to King&#x27;s Inch
* Scalp na Caoraich, Cridhe An Uisge, Rònach and Scalp Phàdraig Mhòir - four small islands at the delta of the River Ness in Inverness which were removed in the 19th century.
* Scottle Holm was an islet north of Lerwick, Shetland. It has since become part of an industrial estate.
* White Inch, now an area of Glasgow.

==Bridged islands==

Many of Scotland&#x27;s islands are connected to the mainland and/or other islands by bridge or causeway. Although some people consider them no longer to be islands, they are generally treated as such.

Outer Hebrides

Many of the islands of the southern Outer Hebrides have been joined to other islands by causeways and bridges. These include:
* Baleshare
* Benbecula
* Berneray
* Eriskay
* Grimsay
* North Uist
* South Uist
* Vatersay, which is connected to Barra (but not to the above islands), by the Vatersay Causeway.

To the north, Scalpay and Great Bernera are connected to Lewis and Harris.

Inner Hebrides
* Skye is connected to the mainland by the Skye Bridge which now incorporates Eilean Bàn.
* Eilean Donan by causeway to the mainland
* Eriska by causeway to the mainland
* Seil (to mainland) via John Stevenson&#x27;s 1792 &quot;Bridge over The Atlantic&quot;.
* Danna by causeway to the mainland

Orkney Islands

Similarly, four Orkney islands are joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of causeways known as the Churchill Barriers. They are:
* South Ronaldsay
* Burray
* Lamb Holm
* Glimps Holm

Hunda is in turn connected to Burray via a causeway.

South Walls and Hoy are connected by a causeway called the Ayre. The islands are treated as one entity (Hoy) by the UK census.

An undersea tunnel between the archipelago and Caithness, at a length of about and a tunnel connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay have been discussed, although little has come of it.

Shetland Islands

Several Shetland islands are joined to the Shetland Mainland:
* West Burra and East Burra (via Trondra)
* Muckle Roe
* Trondra
* Broch of Clickimin is a freshwater islet joined to the mainland by a stone causeway.
* Holm of Mel was a tidal island linked to the west coast of Bressay at low tide but it is now linked permanently to its larger neighbour by a 75m stone causeway.

There is also a bridge which joins Housay and Bruray in the Out Skerries.

Others

Various other islands are also connected by bridges or causeways, to the mainland or other islands, including:
* Inchgarvie (part of Forth Bridge), thus joined to both Fife and Lothian on the Mainland.
* Garbh Eilean at the entrance to Loch Glencoul is now joined to the mainland by both the Kylesku Bridge to the south and its associated roadworks to the north.
* Innis Chonan, an inhabited island in Loch Awe is connected to the mainland by a small road bridge.
* Moncreiffe Island connected to the mainland by the Tay Viaduct

==Tidal islands and tombolos==

There are a large number of small tidal islands in Scotland. The more notable ones include:
* Baleshare
* Bernera
* Calve Island
* Castle Island
* Corn Holm
* Cramond Island
* Island Davaar
* Dunnicaer
* Eilean Mhic Chrion
* Eilean Shona
* Eriska
* Erraid
* Helliar Holm
* Kili Holm
* Isle Ristol
* Sanday
* Torsa

&quot;Oronsay&quot; means &quot;ebb island&quot; and there are several tidal islands of this name.

The three main islands of the Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are connected at low tides. It is said that at one time it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, away at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.

St Ninian&#x27;s Isle is connected to Mainland Shetland by a tombolo. Although greater than 40 hectares in size it fails to meet the definition of an island used in this list as it is only surrounded by water during occasional spring tides and storms.

Dùn in St Kilda is separated from Hirta by a shallow strait about wide. This is normally impassable but is reputed to dry out on rare occasions.

==Complex islands==

There are a number of offshore islands that defy easy classification.
* Ceallasaigh Mòr and Ceallasaigh Beag are islands in Loch Maddy, North Uist which are both c. in extent at high tide. At low tide they are connected to one another and several other small tidal islets in the shallow lagoon that surrounds them.
* Eileanan Iasgaich in Loch Boisdale, South Uist comprises five small islands and several other islets at high tide but forms a single large one of at low tide.
* Eileanan Chearabhaigh. At low tide these islands form a peninsula with a total area of , which is connected to Benbecula by drying sands. At high tide the connection to Benbecula is lost and a number of small islets stretching for over from east to west appear, the largest of which is about in extent.
* The Crowlin Islands, located in the Inner Sound off Raasay are three separate islands at high tide and a single one of at low tide.
* Similarly, Lunga in the Firth of Lorn is six or more separate islets at high tide but a single one of at low tide.

==Castle islands==
There are several small Scottish islands that are dominated by a castle or other fortification. The castle is often better known than the island, and the islands are often tidal or bridged. Due to their picturesque nature some of them are well known from postcards and films. Examples are:

* Bass Rock
* Broch of West Burrafirth
* Castle Island
* Calvay
* Castle Stalker
* Castle Tioram
* Eilean Aigas (F)
* Eilean Dearg, Loch Riddon
* Eilean Donan
* Inchtalla (F)
* Inveruglas Isle (F)
* Kilchurn Castle (F)
* Kisimul Castle
* Lochindorb Castle (F)
* Loch Leven Castle (F)
* Mousa
* Threave Castle (F)
* Wyre

Many of the Islands of the Forth and southern Orkney Islands have fortifications from the two world wars. Rosyth Castle stands on a former island.

==Holy islands==

A large number of the islands of Scotland have some kind of culdee/church connection, and/or are dominated by a church. The more notable include:

* Island Davaar
* Egilsay
* Eynhallow
* Holy Island
* Inchcolm
* Inch Kenneth
* Inchmahome (F)
* Iona
* Isle Maree
* North Rona
* Oronsay
* Papa Stronsay (current Transalpine Redemptorist monastery. Islands called &quot;Papa&quot; or &quot;Pabbay&quot; tend to be former saints&#x27; islands)
* St Ninian&#x27;s Isle
* St Serf&#x27;s Inch (F)
* Tiree (&quot;land of Iona&quot;)

Brother Isle&#x27;s name is not ecclesiastical in origin as is sometimes stated.

==Islands named after people==
This is a list of islands, which are known to be named after someone. In some cases such as North Ronaldsay this status may not be obvious (it isn&#x27;t named after a &quot;Ronald&quot;, unlike South Ronaldsay). This list omits names such as Hildasay, where the person in question is mythological, or Ailsa Craig, where the individual in question is not known, and also Colonsay &amp; Egilsay where the derivation is disputed.

* Eilean Chaluim Chille - Saint Columba
* Island Davaar - Saint Barr
* Eilean Donan - Saint Donan
* Flannan Isles - Saint Flannan
* Frank Lockwood&#x27;s Island (south of Lochbuie, Mull)
* Inchcolm - Saint Columba
* Inch Kenneth - Saint Kenneth
* Inchmarnock - Saint Mearnag
* Inchmahome (F) - Saint Colmag
* Inchmurrin (F) - Saint Meadhran/Mirin
* Innis Chonan (F) - Saint Conan
* Isle Maree (F) - Maelrubha
* Isle Martin - Saint Martin
* North Rona - Saint Ronan
* St Serf&#x27;s Inch (F) - Saint Serf
* Sweyn Holm – Sweyn Asleifsson
* Taransay - Saint Taran

Iqbal Singh, the owner of Vacsay, has also expressed wishes to rename it after Robert Burns.

==Places called &quot;island&quot; etc. that are not islands==
Some places in Scotland with names including &quot;isle&quot; or &quot;island&quot; are not islands. They include:
Lewis and Harris are separated by a range of hills but form one island, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;Lewis and Harris&quot;. Isle of Whithorn and the Black Isle are peninsulas, and Isleornsay is a village which looks out onto the island of Ornsay. There is no commonly accepted derivation for &quot;Burntisland&quot; which had numerous other forms in the past, such as &quot;Brintilun&quot; and &quot;Ye Brint Eland&quot;.

Gluss Isle at the western entrance to Sullom Voe is one of the many promontories in Orkney and Shetland connected to a larger body of land by an ayre.

===Other elements===
The name &quot;Inch&quot; (&quot;Innis&quot;) can mean island (e.g. Inchkenneth, Inchcolm), but is also used for &quot;terra firma&quot; surrounded by marsh e.g. Markinch, Insch.

&quot;Eilean&quot; is Gaelic for &quot;island&quot;. However, Inistrynich, Eilean na Maodail, Eilean Dubh and Liever Island are all promontories on Loch Awe as opposed to islands, despite their names. Likewise Eilean Aoidhe on Loch Fyne. The Black Isle is also &quot;An t-Eilean Dubh&quot; in Gaelic, while Eilean Glas is part of Scalpay.

&quot;-holm&quot; is also common as a suffix in various landlocked placenames, especially in the far south of mainland Scotland e.g. Langholm, Kirk Yetholm, Holmhead (by Cumnock), Holmhill (next to Thornhill, Nithsdale). Some of these were river islands in their time, or dry land surrounded by marsh. &quot;Holm&quot; can be found in an element in Holmsgarth, now a suburb of Lerwick and the Parish of Holm on Mainland Shetland and Mainland Orkney respectively. Neither of these is an island in its own right.

===Islands named after mainland areas===
Likewise, occasionally an island may be named after a location on the nearby mainland, or a major neighbouring island – or vice versa. Examples of this include: Vementry, which was originally the name of an island, but whose name has been transferred to a nearby farm on Mainland Shetland; Oldany Island, whose name has been transferred to Oldany; Cramond Island which is named after neighbouring Cramond (a district of Edinburgh); and Eilean Mhealasta in the Outer Hebrides, which is named after Mealista on Lewis.

The name Easdale appears to be the combination of &quot;eas&quot;, which is Gaelic for &quot;waterfall&quot; and &quot;dal&quot;, the Norse for &quot;valley&quot;. However, it is not clear why either description should apply to this tiny island which is low-lying and has no waterfalls and the name may have come from the nearby village of the same name on Seil.

==Stacks==

It has been estimated that there are about 275 sea stacks in Scotland, of which around 110 are located around the coasts of Shetland. The highest are Stac an Armin and Stac Lee, St Kilda. In July 1967, 15 million people watched the climbing of the Old Man of Hoy live on BBC television. However, for many of the remoter stacks, especially in Shetland, there is no record of there having been any attempt by rock climbers to ascend them.

==Crannogs==

Crannogs are prehistoric artificial islands created in lochs. There are several hundred sites in Scotland. Today, crannogs typically appear as small, circular islands, between 10 and 30 metres (30–100 feet) in diameter. Scottish crannogs include:
* Breachacha on Coll
* Cherry Island in Loch Ness
* Dùn Anlaimh on Coll
* Eilean Dòmhnuill on North Uist
* Keppinch (or The Kitchen) in Loch Lomond

<text>Phytochemicals are chemical compounds produced by plants, generally to help them resist fungi, bacteria and plant virus infections, and also consumption by insects and other animals. The name comes . Some phytochemicals have been used as poisons and others as traditional medicine.

As a term, &quot;phytochemicals&quot; is generally used to describe plant compounds that are under research with unestablished effects on health, and are not essential nutrients. Regulatory agencies governing food labeling in Europe and the United States have provided guidance for industry to limit or prevent health claims about phytochemicals on food product or nutrition labels.

==Definition==
Phytochemicals are chemicals of plant origin. Phytochemicals (from Greek &quot;phyto&quot;, meaning &quot;plant&quot;) are chemicals produced by plants through primary or secondary metabolism. They generally have biological activity in the plant host and play a role in plant growth or defense against competitors, pathogens, or predators.

Phytochemicals are generally regarded as research compounds rather than essential nutrients because proof of their possible health effects has not been established yet. Phytochemicals under research can be classified into major categories, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, which include phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes or lignans. Flavonoids can be further divided into groups based on their similar chemical structure, such as anthocyanins, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, and flavanols. Flavanols are further classified as catechins, epicatechins, and proanthocyanidins. In total, between 50,000 and 130,000 phytochemicals have been discovered.

Phytochemists study phytochemicals by first extracting and isolating compounds from the origin plant, followed by defining their structure or testing in laboratory model systems, such as &quot;in vitro&quot; studies using cell lines or &quot;in vivo&quot; studies using laboratory animals. Challenges in that field include isolating specific compounds and determining their structures, which are often complex, and identifying what specific phytochemical is primarily responsible for any given biological activity.

==History of uses==
Without specific knowledge of their cellular actions or mechanisms, phytochemicals have been used as poison and in traditional medicine. For example, salicin, having anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, was originally extracted from the bark of the white willow tree and later synthetically produced to become the common, over-the-counter drug aspirin. The tropane alkaloids of &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot; were used as poisons, and early humans made poisonous arrows from the plant. In Ancient Rome, it was used as a poison by Agrippina the Younger, wife of Emperor Claudius on advice of Locusta, a lady specialized in poisons, and Livia, who is rumored to have used it to kill her husband Emperor Augustus. Other uses include perfumes, such as the sequiterpene santolols, from sandalwood.

The English yew tree was long known to be extremely and immediately toxic to animals that grazed on its leaves or children who ate its berries; however, in 1971, paclitaxel was isolated from it, subsequently becoming an important cancer drug.

The biological activities for most phytochemicals are unknown or poorly understood, in isolation or as part of foods. Phytochemicals with established roles in the body are classified as essential nutrients.

==Functions==
The phytochemical category includes compounds recognized as essential nutrients, which are naturally contained in plants and are required for normal physiological functions, so must be obtained from the diet in humans.

Some phytochemicals are known phytotoxins that are toxic to humans; for example aristolochic acid is carcinogenic at low doses. Some phytochemicals are antinutrients that interfere with the absorption of nutrients. Others, such as some polyphenols and flavonoids, may be pro-oxidants in high ingested amounts.

Non-digestible dietary fibers from plant foods, often considered as a phytochemical, are now generally regarded as a nutrient group having approved health claims for reducing the risk of some types of cancer and coronary heart disease.

Eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes and plant-based beverages has long-term health benefits, but there is no evidence that taking dietary supplements of non-nutrient phytochemicals extracted from plants similarly benefits health. Phytochemical supplements are neither recommended by health authorities for improving health nor approved by regulatory agencies for health claims on product labels.

==Consumer and industry guidance==

While health authorities encourage consumers to eat diets rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts to improve and maintain health, evidence that such effects result from specific, non-nutrient phytochemicals is limited or absent. For example, systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses indicate weak or no evidence for phytochemicals from plant food consumption having an effect on breast, lung, or bladder cancers. Further, in the United States, regulations exist to limit the language on product labels for how plant food consumption may affect cancers, excluding mention of any phytochemical except for those with established health benefits against cancer, such as dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.

Phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, have been specifically discouraged from food labeling in Europe and the United States because there is no evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between dietary polyphenols and inhibition or prevention of any disease.

Among carotenoids such as the tomato phytochemical, lycopene, the US Food and Drug Administration found insufficient evidence for its effects on any of several cancer types, resulting in limited language for how products containing lycopene can be described on labels.

==Effects of food processing==

Phytochemicals in freshly harvested plant foods may be degraded by processing techniques, including cooking. The main cause of phytochemical loss from cooking is thermal decomposition.

A converse exists in the case of carotenoids, such as lycopene present in tomatoes, which may remain stable or increase in content from cooking due to liberation from cellular membranes in the cooked food. Food processing techniques like mechanical processing can also free carotenoids and other phytochemicals from the food matrix, increasing dietary intake.

In some cases, processing of food is necessary to remove phytotoxins or antinutrients; for example societies that use cassava as a staple have traditional practices that involve some processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.), which are necessary to avoid getting sick from cyanogenic glycosides present in unprocessed cassava.

<text>Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, of Penshurst in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1956 for William Sidney, 6th Baron de L&#x27;Isle and Dudley (1909–1991).

==History==
This branch of the Shelley family descends from John Shelley-Sidney, the only son of the second marriage of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet, of Castle Goring (see Shelley baronets for earlier history of the family), by Elizabeth Jane Perry, daughter of William Perry and Elizabeth Sidney, daughter and heir of the Hon. Thomas Sidney, fourth son of Robert Sidney, 4th Earl of Leicester (a title which had become extinct in 1743; see the Earl of Leicester 1618 creation). In 1799 he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Sidney on succeeding to the estates, including Penshurst Place in Kent, of his maternal grandmother. In 1818 he was created a Baronet, of Penshurst in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

His son and heir apparent, Philip Sidney, represented Eye in the House of Commons. In 1835, fourteen years before succeeding his father in the baronetcy, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley, of Penshurst in the County of Kent. He was son-in-law of then King William IV. The title derived from the fact that the title of &quot;Viscount De L&#x27;Isle&quot; had been held by his ancestors the Earls of Leicester (in turn deriving from their ancestors), but had become extinct along with the earldom in 1743. The title of &quot;Dudley&quot; came from the fact that Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester (of the 1618 creation), was the nephew of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (of the 1564 creation), the fifth son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, who was as well Viscount Lisle by right of his mother. Lord De L&#x27;Isle and Dudley discontinued the use of the surname Shelley.

His grandson, the fifth Baron (who only held the titles for two months in 1945 after succeeding his elder brother), notably served as Mayor of Chelsea and was a member of the London County Council. His son, the sixth Baron, was a prominent Conservative politician and served as Secretary of State for Air from 1951 to 1955. In 1956, he was created Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, of Penshurst in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord De L&#x27;Isle later served as Governor-General of Australia. In 1965 he also succeeded his kinsman as the ninth Baronet of Castle Goring. the titles are held by his son, the second Viscount, who succeeded in 1991.

As heir of the college&#x27;s founder, Lord De L&#x27;Isle is the hereditary visitor of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.

<text>Elsie Eleanore Wayne (née Fairweather; April 20, 1932 – August 23, 2016) was a Canadian politician who served as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Saint John from 1993 to 2004. She was born in Shediac, New Brunswick.

==Political career==
In 1977, she was elected to the Saint John municipal council. In 1983, she became the first female mayor of Saint John, and became extremely popular in the city.

In the 1993 federal election, she ran as the governing Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s candidate in the riding of Saint John-Rothesay. In this election, the Tories suffered the worst ever defeat for a governing party at the federal level in Canada. Wayne was one of only two Tories elected nationwide, the other being Jean Charest; Charest won his third term at Sherbrooke in 1993. She was also the only non-Liberal elected in Atlantic Canada that year. She was elected by 4,000 votes, but never faced another contest nearly that close.

In 1998, when Charest resigned the leadership of the PC party to become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, Wayne was appointed the PC party&#x27;s interim leader, a post she held until former Prime Minister Joe Clark was elected party leader later that year.

She supported the merger of the Progressive Conservatives (led by Peter MacKay) and the Canadian Alliance (led by Stephen Harper) in 2003.

Wayne announced her retirement from politics on February 16, 2004 and did not run for re-election in the 2004 election to the House of Commons of Canada.

==Political positions==
Politically, she was known as being socially conservative, vehemently opposing same-sex marriage. She was also against abortion rights, decriminalization of marijuana, and Viagra for war veterans.

Fiscally, Wayne was a strong believer in Canada&#x27;s social safety net and the welfare state, which was typical for most Tories from Atlantic Canada. She was also among Canada&#x27;s most vocal monarchists.

==Later life and death==
Wayne considered a run for her old seat in the 2006 election, but decided against a comeback. She did, however, serve as chairwoman of the Conservative campaign in Atlantic Canada.

She was married to Richard Wayne, with whom she had two sons, Daniel and Stephen. In November 2009, she suffered a stroke. She was released from hospital in February 2010. She died on August 23, 2016, at her home in Saint John.

<text>Viscount Dilhorne, of Greens Norton in the County of Northampton, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 7 December 1964 for the lawyer, Conservative politician and former Lord Chancellor, Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Baron Dilhorne. He had already succeeded his father as fourth Baronet of Dilhorne and been created Baron Dilhorne, &quot;of Towcester in the County of Northampton&quot; on 17 July 1962, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The Manningham-Buller baronetcy, of Dilhorne in the County of Stafford, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 20 January 1866 for the first Viscount&#x27;s great-grandfather Edward Buller-Yarde-Buller, who legally changed his name to Manningham-Buller the same year. He represented Staffordshire North and Stafford in Parliament. Manningham-Buller was the third son of Sir Francis Buller, 2nd Baronet, of Churston Court, whose eldest son, the third Baronet, was created [[Baron Churston]] in 1858. His grandson, the third Baronet, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Kettering and Northampton. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the aforementioned fourth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Dilhorne. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the third Viscount, who succeeded in 2022.

Eliza Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller, a life peer and former Director General of MI5, is the second daughter of the first Viscount.

The family seat is The Dower House, near Dorchester, Dorset.

<doc id="472248" wikidata="Q35228" url="?curid=472248" title="Old East Slavic">
<text>Old East Slavic (traditionally also Old Russian) was a language (or a group of dialects) used by the East Slavs from the 7th or 8th century to the 13th or 14th century, until it diverged into the Russian and Ruthenian languages. Ruthenian eventually evolved into the Belarusian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian languages.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;Old East Slavic&quot; is used in reference to the modern family of East Slavic languages. However, it is not universally applied. The language is also traditionally known as &quot;Old Russian&quot;; however, the term may be viewed as anachronistic, because the initial stages of the language which it denotes predate the dialectal divisions marking the nascent distinction between modern East Slavic languages, therefore a number of authors have proposed using &quot;Old East Slavic&quot; (or &quot;Common East Slavic&quot;) as a more appropriate term. &quot;Old Russian&quot; is also used to describe the written language in Russia until the 18th century, when it became &quot;Modern Russian&quot;, though the early stages of the language is often called &quot;Old East Slavic&quot; instead; the period after the common language of the East Slavs is sometimes distinguished as &quot;Middle Russian&quot;, or &quot;Great Russian&quot;.

Some scholars have also called the language &quot;Old Rus&#x27;ian&quot; or &quot;Old Rusan&quot;, &quot;Rusian&quot;, or simply &quot;Rus&quot;, although these are the least commonly used forms.

Ukrainian-American linguist George Shevelov used the term &quot;Common Russian&quot; or &quot;Common Eastern Slavic&quot; to refer to the hypothetical uniform language of the East Slavs.

American Slavist Alexander M. Schenker pointed out that modern terms for the medieval language of the East Slavs varied depending on the political context. He suggested using the neutral term &quot;East Slavic&quot; for that language.
== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Note that there were also iotated variants: ꙗ, ѥ, ю, ѩ, ѭ.

By the 13th century, ь and ъ either became silent or merged with е and о, and ѧ and ѫ had merged with ꙗ and у respectively.

=== Consonants ===
Old East slavic retains all the consonants of Proto-Slavic, with the exception of ť and ď which merged into č and ž respectively.
After the 11th century, all consonants become palatalized before front vowels.

==General considerations==
The language was a descendant of the Proto-Slavic language and retained many of its features. It developed so-called pleophony (or &quot;polnoglasie&quot; &#x27;full vocalisation&#x27;), which came to differentiate the newly evolving East Slavic from other Slavic dialects. For instance, Common Slavic &#x27; &#x27;settlement, town&#x27; was reflected as OESl. &quot;gorodъ&quot;, Common Slavic &#x27; &#x27;milk&#x27; &gt; OESl. &quot;moloko&quot;, and Common Slavic &quot;&quot; &#x27;cow&#x27; &gt; OESl &quot;korova&quot;. Other Slavic dialects differed by resolving the closed-syllable clusters *eRC and *aRC as liquid metathesis (South Slavic and West Slavic), or by no change at all (see the article on &quot;Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony&quot; for a detailed account).

Since extant written records of the language are sparse, it is difficult to assess the level of its unity. In consideration of the number of tribes and clans that constituted Kievan Rus&#x27;, it is probable that there were many dialects of Old East Slavonic. Therefore, today we may speak definitively only of the languages of surviving manuscripts, which, according to some interpretations, show regional divergence from the beginning of the historical records. By , it had the weakest local variations among the four regional macrodialects of Common Slavic, , which had just begun to differentiate into its branches.

With time, it evolved into several more diversified forms; following the fragmentation of Kievan Rus&#x27; after 1100, dialectal differentiation accelerated. The regional languages were distinguishable starting in the 12th or 13th century. Thus different variations evolved of the Russian language in the regions of Novgorod, Moscow, South Russia and meanwhile the Ukrainian language was also formed. Each of these languages preserves much of the Old East Slavic grammar and vocabulary. The Russian language in particular borrows more words from Church Slavonic than does Ukrainian.

However, findings by Russian linguist Andrey Zaliznyak suggest that, until the 14th or 15th century, major language differences were not between the regions occupied by modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but rather between the north-west (around modern Velikiy Novgorod and Pskov) and the center (around modern Kyiv, Suzdal, Rostov, Moscow as well as Belarus) of the East Slavic territories. The Old Novgorodian dialect of that time differed from the central East Slavic dialects as well as from all other Slavic languages much more than in later centuries. According to Zaliznyak, the Russian language developed as a convergence of that dialect and the central ones, whereas Ukrainian and Belarusian were continuation of development of the central dialects of the East Slavs.

Also, Russian linguist Sergey Nikolaev, analysing historical development of Slavic dialects&#x27; accent system, concluded that a number of other tribes in Kievan Rus&#x27; came from different Slavic branches and spoke distant Slavic dialects.

Another Russian linguist, G. A. Khaburgaev, as well as a number of Ukrainian linguists (Stepan Smal-Stotsky, Ivan Ohienko, George Shevelov, Yevhen Tymchenko, Vsevolod Hantsov, Olena Kurylo), deny the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past. According to them, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages.

Following the end of the &quot;Tatar yoke&quot;, the territory of former Kievan Rus&#x27; was divided between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and two separate literary traditions emerged in these states, Ruthenian in the west and medieval Russian in the east.

== Literary language==

The political unification of the region into the state called Kievan Rus&#x27;, from which modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine trace their origins, occurred approximately a century before the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the establishment of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and literary language. Documentation of the Old East Slavic language of this period is scanty, making it difficult at best fully to determine the relationship between the literary language and its spoken dialects.

There are references in Byzantine sources to pre-Christian Slavs in European Russia using some form of writing. Despite some suggestive archaeological finds and a corroboration by the tenth-century monk Chernorizets Hrabar that ancient Slavs wrote in &quot;strokes and incisions&quot;, the exact nature of this system is unknown.

Although the Glagolitic alphabet was briefly introduced, as witnessed by church inscriptions in Novgorod, it was soon entirely superseded by Cyrillic. The samples of birch-bark writing excavated in Novgorod have provided crucial information about the pure tenth-century vernacular in North-West Russia, almost entirely free of Church Slavonic influence. It is also known that borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the vernacular at this time, and that simultaneously the literary language in its turn began to be modified towards Eastern Slavic.

The following excerpts illustrate two of the most famous literary monuments.

NOTE: The spelling of the original excerpt has been partly modernized. The translations are best attempts at being literal, not literary.

=== &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; ===
, from the Laurentian Codex, 1377:

In this usage example of the language, the fall of the yers is in progress or arguably complete: several words end with a consonant, e.g. &quot;to rule&quot; &lt; (modern Uk , R , B ). South Slavic features include &quot;bygone&quot; (modern R , Uk , B ). Correct use of perfect and aorist: &quot;is/has come&quot; (modern B , R , Uk ), &quot;began&quot; (modern Uk , B , R ) as a development of the old perfect. Note the style of punctuation.

=== &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; ===
Слово о пълку Игоревѣ. , from the Pskov manuscript, fifteenth cent.
Illustrates the sung epics, with typical use of metaphor and simile.

It has been suggested that the phrase (, to run in thought upon/over wood), which has become proverbial in modern Russian with the meaning &quot;to speak ornately, at length, excessively,&quot; is a misreading of an original (akin to &quot;mouse&quot;) from &quot;run like a squirrel/mouse on a tree&quot;; however, the reading is present in both the manuscript copy of 1790 and the first edition of 1800, and in all subsequent scholarly editions.

== Old East Slavic literature ==
The Old East Slavic language developed a certain literature of its own, though much of it (in hand with those of the Slavic languages that were, after all, written down) was influenced as regards style and vocabulary by religious texts written in Church Slavonic. Surviving literary monuments include the legal code &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, a corpus of hagiography and homily, &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, and the earliest surviving manuscript of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; – the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot; of 1377.

The earliest dated specimen of Old East Slavic (or, rather, of Church Slavonic with pronounced East Slavic interference) must be considered the written &quot;Sermon on Law and Grace&quot; by Hilarion, metropolitan of Kiev. In this work there is a panegyric on Prince Vladimir of Kiev, the hero of so much of East Slavic popular poetry. It is rivalled by another panegyric on Vladimir, written a decade later by Yakov the Monk.

Other 11th-century writers are Theodosius, a monk of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, who wrote on the Latin faith and some &quot;Pouchenia&quot; or &quot;Instructions&quot;, and Luka Zhidiata, bishop of Novgorod, who has left a curious &quot;Discourse to the Brethren&quot;. From the writings of Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in vogue among the people. He finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors. And here may be mentioned the many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be found in early East Slavic literature, starting with the two Lives of Sts Boris and Gleb, written in the late eleventh century and attributed to Jacob the Monk and to Nestor the Chronicler.

With the so-called &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, also attributed to Nestor, begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to Nestor the Chronicler, there are the chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others.

In the 12th century, we have the sermons of bishop Cyril of Turov, which are attempts to imitate in Old East Slavic the florid Byzantine style. In his sermon on Holy Week, Christianity is represented under the form of spring, Paganism and Judaism under that of winter, and evil thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds.

There are also the works of early travellers, as the igumen Daniel, who visited the Holy Land at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century. A later traveller was Afanasiy Nikitin, a merchant of Tver, who visited India in 1470. He has left a record of his adventures, which has been translated into English and published for the Hakluyt Society.

A curious monument of old Slavonic times is the &quot;Pouchenie&quot; (&quot;Instruction&quot;), written by Vladimir Monomakh for the benefit of his sons. This composition is generally found inserted in the Chronicle of Nestor; it gives a fine picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince. &quot;The Paterik of the Kievan Caves Monastery&quot; is a typical medieval collection of stories from the life of monks, featuring devils, angels, ghosts, and miraculous resurrections.

Lay of Igor&#x27;s Campaign narrates the expedition of Igor Svyatoslavich, the prince of Novgorod-Seversk, against the Cumans. It is neither epic nor a poem but is written in rhythmic prose. An interesting aspect of the text is its mix of Christianity and ancient Slavic religion. Igor&#x27;s wife Yaroslavna famously invokes natural forces from the walls of Putyvl. Christian motifs present along with depersonalised pagan gods in the form of artistic images. Another aspect, which sets the book apart from contemporary Western epics, are its numerous and vivid descriptions of nature, and the role which nature plays in human lives. Of the whole bulk of the Old East Slavic literature, the Lay is the only work familiar to every educated Russian or Ukrainian. Its brooding flow of images, murky metaphors, and ever changing rhythm have not been successfully rendered into English yet. Indeed, the meanings of many words found in it have not been satisfactorily explained by scholars.

The &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; is a sort of prose poem much in the style of the &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, and the resemblance of the latter to this piece furnishes an additional proof of its genuineness. This account of the Battle of Kulikovo, which was gained by Dmitry Donskoy over the Mongols in 1380, has come down in three important versions.

The early laws of Rus&#x27; present many features of interest, such as the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav the Wise, which is preserved in the chronicle of Novgorod; the date is between 1018 and 1072.

== Study ==

The earliest attempts to compile a comprehensive lexicon of Old East Slavic were undertaken by Alexander Vostokov and Izmail Sreznevsky in the nineteenth century. Sreznevsky&#x27;s &quot;Materials for the Dictionary of the Old Russian Language on the Basis of Written Records&quot; (1893–1903), though incomplete, remained a standard reference until the appearance of a 24-volume academic dictionary in 1975–99.

== Notable texts ==

* &quot;Bylinas&quot;
* &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; – the most outstanding literary work in this language 
* &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; – an eleventh-century legal code issued by Yaroslav the Wise
* &quot;Praying of Daniel the Immured&quot;
* &quot;A Journey Beyond the Three Seas&quot;

<doc id="472249" wikidata="Q1785848" url="?curid=472249" title="List of islands of Wales">
<text>This is a list of [[island]]s of [[Wales]], the mainland of which is part of Great Britain, as well as a table of the largest Welsh islands by area. The list includes tidal islands such as Sully Island but not locations such as Shell Island which, though they are termed islands, are peninsulas.

== Largest islands in Wales ==
*Holy Island and Anglesey are often counted together as they are separated by such a narrow channel.

== Inland islands ==
There are no islands of any great size in lakes in Wales. The crannog in Llangorse Lake is an artificial island. Several reservoirs contain islets e.g. Llyn Brenig, Elan Valley Reservoirs and Llyn Trawsfynydd, the last named having the largest and most numerous, though some are linked by causeways.

==Places called &quot;island&quot; or &quot;ynys&quot; that are not islands==
Some places around the Welsh coast are called island or (Welsh) ynys, but are not. Caution is required in that whilst &#x27;ynys&#x27; most commonly translates as island, it has other meanings too. Some of these named places were formerly islands surrounded by marshland. Others are peninsulas or just coastal settlements. They include:

* Barry Island (tidal island until the construction of Barry Docks in the 1880s)
* Berges Island, peninsula at Whitford Burrows, Gower
* Dinas Island, peninsula on Pembrokeshire coast
* Farchynys, locality beside Mawddach estuary, Bontddu, Gwynedd
* Little Island, peninsula at the west end of the former Barry Island
* Shell Island
* Traeth Mawr - there are multiple examples of names including &#x27;ynys&#x27; around Traeth Mawr, the now drained estuarine flats of the Afon Glaslyn, Gwynedd, including Hir Ynys, Ynys y Gwely, Ynys Ceiliog, Ynys Fawr, Ynys-fach and Ynys Fer-las.
* Ynys, hamlet on an area of raised ground known as Ynys Llanfihangel-y-traethau at Morfa Harlech, Gwynedd
* Ynys and nearby Ynys-fach on coast south of Dinas Dinlle, Gwynedd
* Ynysboeth, area of Abercynon in the Cynon Valley, Mid Glamorgan
* Ynysddu, village in the Sirhowy valley, Caerphilly County Borough
* Ynyshir, village in the Rhondda, Mid Glamorgan
* Ynyslas, locality at Borth, north Ceredigion - there are multiple examples of names including &#x27;ynys&#x27; around the Dovey estuary including Ynys Tachwedd, Ynysfergi, Ynys Greigiog, Ynys-hir, Ynys Edwin, Ynys-Eidiol and simple &#x27;Ynys&#x27;.
* Ynys Leurad, a small peninsula near Four Mile Bridge, Anglesey
* Ynysmaerdy, village near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf
* Ynyswen, village in the Rhondda, Mid Glamorgan
* Ynysybwl, village between the Rhondda and Cynon Valleys, Mid Glamorgan

<doc id="472263" wikidata="Q271523" url="?curid=472263" title="Mae Murray">
<text>Mae Murray (born Marie Adrienne Koenig; May 10, 1885 – March 23, 1965) was an American actress, dancer, film producer, and screenwriter. Murray rose to fame during the silent film era and was known as &quot;The Girl with the Bee-Stung Lips&quot; and &quot;The Gardenia of the Screen&quot;.

==Early life==
Murray was born in New York City, the second-oldest child of Joseph and Mary (née Miller) Koenig. Her maternal grandparents had emigrated from France while her paternal grandparents had emigrated from Germany. She had two brothers, William Robert and Howard Joseph.

The family eventually moved to an apartment in the Lower East Side. In May 1896, Murray&#x27;s father, died from acute gastritis due to his alcoholism. To support the family, her mother took a job as a housekeeper for Harry Payne Whitney.

==Career==

===Stage===
Murray began acting on the Broadway stage in 1906 with dancer Vernon Castle. In 1908, she joined the chorus line of the Ziegfeld Follies, moving to headliner by 1915. Murray became a star of the club circuit in both the United States and Europe, performing with Clifton Webb, Rudolph Valentino, and John Gilbert as some of her many dance partners. 

===Films===
Murray made her motion picture debut in &quot;To Have and to Hold&quot; in 1916. She became a major star for Universal, starring with Rudolph Valentino in &quot;The Delicious Little Devil&quot; and &quot;Big Little Person&quot; in 1919. At the height of her popularity, Murray formed her own production company with Robert Z. Leonard. Critics were sometimes less than thrilled with her over-the-top costumes and exaggerated emoting, but her films were popular with movie-going audiences and financially successful. 

In 1925, Murray, Leonard, and Stahl produced films at Tiffany Pictures, with &quot;Souls for Sables&quot; (1925), starring Claire Windsor and Eugene O&#x27;Brien, as the first film made by Tiffany. For a brief period of time, Murray wrote a weekly column for newspaper scion William Randolph Hearst. 

At her career peak in the early 1920s, Murray, with other notable Hollywood personalities such as Cecil B. DeMille, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Jesse L. Lasky, Harold Lloyd, Hal Roach, Donald Crisp, Conrad Nagel and Irving Thalberg, was a member of the board of trustees at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund – a charitable organization that offers assistance and care to those in the motion picture and television industries without resources. Four decades later, Murray received aid from this organization. 

In the early 1920s, Murray was painted by Hollywood portrait painter Theodore Lukits. This work titled &quot;Symphony in Jade and Gold (The Actress Mae Murray)&quot; (1922, private collection, northern California) depicted Murray nude, gazing in a mirror. It was exhibited at the Pacific Asia Museum in 1999 and two other venues as part of the exhibition &quot;Theodore Lukits, An American Orientalist&quot;. 
===Decline===

Murray appeared in the title role in the Erich von Stroheim-directed film &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1925), with John Gilbert. When silent films gave way to sound film, she debuted in the medium in &quot;Peacock Alley&quot; (1930), a remake of her earlier 1921 version &quot;Peacock Alley&quot;. In 1931, she was cast with Irene Dunne, Lowell Sherman, and fellow silent screen star Norman Kerry in &quot;Bachelor Apartment&quot;. The film was critically panned at the time of release, and Murray made only one more film: &quot;High Stakes&quot; (1931), also with Sherman.

A critical blow to her film career occurred after she married her fourth husband David Mdivani, a Georgian man of minor aristocratic roots, whose brothers Serge and Alexis married actress Pola Negri and the heiress Barbara Hutton respectively. The couple married on June 27, 1926, and Mdivani became her manager, suggesting that his new wife ought to leave MGM. Murray took her husband&#x27;s advice and walked out of her contract with MGM, making a powerful foe of studio boss Louis B. Mayer. Later, she swallowed her pride and pleaded to return, but Mayer would not rehire her. In effect, Mayer&#x27;s hostility meant that Murray was blacklisted from working for the Hollywood studios.

Meanwhile, in 1927, Murray was sued by her then-masseuse, the famous Hollywood fitness guru Sylvia of Hollywood, for the outstanding amount of $2,125; a humiliating and detailed court case followed.

==Later years==
In the 1940s, Murray appeared regularly at Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe, a nightclub that specialized in a &quot;Gay &#x27;90s&quot; atmosphere, often presenting stars of the past for nostalgic value. Her appearances collected mixed reviews: her dancing (in particular the Merry Widow Waltz) was well received, but she was criticized for her youthful costumes and heavy makeup application, which were seen as attempts to conceal her age. In 1946 she taught ballroom dancing to teenagers at a dance studio in Los Angeles. It was located on Crenshaw Blvd., near 48th Street.

Murray&#x27;s finances continued to collapse, and for most of her later life, she lived in poverty. She was the subject of the authorized biography &quot;The Self-Enchanted&quot; (1959), written by Jane Ardmore, that has been incorrectly called Murray&#x27;s autobiography.

On the evening of February 19, 1964, 78-year-old Murray was found disoriented in St. Louis, thinking that she had completed a bus trip to New York City. Murray explained to a Salvation Army officer that she had become lost trying to find her hotel, which she had forgotten the name of. She also refused bus fare back to Los Angeles as she claimed to have a ticket for the remainder of the journey in her purse &quot;if she could find it.&quot;

==Personal life==

In September 1908, in Hoboken, New Jersey, while she was appearing in the &quot;Follies of 1908&quot;, Murray married William M. Schwenker Jr. (born 1885), the unemployed son of a brewery-supply dealer, who cut off his son&#x27;s allowance upon news of the wedding; they divorced in 1910. On December 18, 1916, she married former dancer and future Olympic bobsled champion Jay O&#x27;Brien. He had been married to Irene Fenwick.

After divorcing O&#x27;Brien in 1918, Murray wed movie director Robert Z. Leonard on August 18, 1918; they divorced on May 26, 1925.

Murray married David Mdivani, her fourth husband, on June 27, 1926. They had one child, Koran David Mdivani (1926-2018), then divorced in 1933. Koran later was raised by Sara Elizabeth &quot;Bess&quot; Cunning of Averill Park, New York, who began taking care of him in 1936 when the child was recovering from a double mastoid operation (Cunning&#x27;s brother Dr. David Cunning was the surgeon). When Murray attempted to regain custody of her son in 1939, Cunning and her other brothers, John, Ambrose, and Cortland, refused, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, at which time Murray and her former husband Mdivani entered a bitter custody dispute. It finally ended in 1940, with Murray being given legal custody of the child and the court&#x27;s ordering Mdivani to pay $400 per month in support. However, Koran Mdivani continued to live with Bess Cunning, who adopted him in 1940 under the name Daniel Michael Cunning. Reportedly, Mdivani had managed to drain nearly all of Murray&#x27;s money.

Murray campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

==Death==
Many years later, Murray moved into the Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California, a retirement community for Hollywood professionals. She died there on March 23, 1965, at the age of 79. She is interred in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Mae Murray has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6318 Hollywood Blvd. She was one of three actresses (Pola Negri and Theda Bara were the others) whose eyes were combined to form the Chicago International Film Festival&#x27;s logo, a stark, black-and-white close-up of the composite eyes set as repeated frames in a strip of film.

<text>Torch Bay is a freshwater bay connecting Torch Lake with Portage Lake in Houghton County on the Keweenaw Peninsula, which juts into Lake Superior from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is lined by the unincorporated settlements of Dreamland, Point Mills and Senter and by wooded hills of as much as 200 feet (60 m) in height.
There is also the Torch Bay Natural Area — 39 acres (158,000 m2) in Torch Lake Township, Antrim County, Michigan in the Lower Peninsula. A one-mile (1.6-km) loop trail runs through the township-owned park.

<text>Peter Waldron Yates (August 23, 1747 – 1826) was a lawyer and statesman from Albany, New York. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1786.

Yates was the son of John G. and Rebecca Waldron Yates. His father was a blacksmith in Albany, but also owned a farm in Rensselaerswyck (in what is today the town of Bethlehem). Despite his background as one child in a large working-class family, Peter acquired an education, and read for the law. In 1767 he was admitted to the bar and married Ann Margarita Helms of New York City.

In 1768 Yates opened a law practice in Albany. His practice was very successful for over thirty years, even though interrupted by the Revolutionary War. In its later years he trained a number of young men in the law. His political career began in 1772 when he was elected to the Albany city council. He would be reelected annually for several years until the last council meeting under the colonial government in March 1776.

==American Revolutionary War==
The revolution was a difficult time for Yates. He had been elected to the Committee of Correspondence for Albany in 1775 but resigned after only two months. He wrote an essay that expressed doubts over the direction of the revolution. When asked to rejoin the revolutionary committee, he declined and was never again entirely trusted by the rebels. He had close connections with the colonial establishment and ties to the landed interests. He took several steps to counter this. He left the Anglican Church and joined the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany. On June 28, 1775 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 2nd New York Regiment. He was a colonel of the Albany County militia from 1779 to 1780, and saw action around Lake Champlain. He continued to expand his law practice throughout the revolution.

==After War Years==
When the active fighting in the revolution ended, Yates again entered politics. A long-time Freemason, he became an officer in the Albany lodge and was the Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of New York in 1784-1788. In 1784 he ran for the state assembly. He represented Albany there in 1784 and 1785. In 1786 they sent him to New York City as a delegate in the Continental Congress. This would be his last major office. During the debate over ratification of the United States Constitution, Yates was an active Anti-Federalist.

When removed from politics, his practice and investments thrived, and he became one of the most prosperous men in Albany. In 1794 his wife died, and in 1798 he remarried, this time to Mary Terbush &quot;(Ter Boss)&quot;. He would have three more children with Mary, bringing his large family up to eleven children. He built a mansion on the south side of town, and only the Philip Schuyler house was more impressive.

In 1808 he was made a state judge for the western district of New York. In 1810 he moved to Montgomery County, New York, living on another property that he owned. He died there in Caughnawaga (now Fonda, New York) on March 9, 1826.

<text>Karl Jay Shapiro (November 10, 1913 – May 14, 2000) was an American poet. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1945 for his collection &quot;V-Letter and Other Poems&quot;. He was appointed the fifth Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1946.

Shapiro served in the Pacific Theater as a United States Army company clerk during World War II.

==Biography==
Shapiro was born and initially raised in Baltimore, Maryland. After spending much of his childhood and adolescence in Chicago, Illinois, the family returned to Baltimore, where he completed his secondary education at Baltimore City College. He briefly attended the University of Virginia during the 1932-1933 academic year, and wrote about it in a critical poem called &quot;University&quot;, which noted that &quot;to hurt the Negro and avoid the Jew is the curriculum.&quot; His first volume of poetry was published by a family friend at the behest of his uncle in 1935. After continuing his studies at the Peabody Institute (where he majored in piano performance), he attended Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship from 1937 to 1939. In 1940, he enrolled in a library science school associated with Baltimore&#x27;s Enoch Pratt Free Library, where he was also employed.

Shapiro wrote poetry in the Pacific Theater while he served there as a United States Army company clerk during World War II. Throughout the conflict, he engaged in near-daily correspondence with his fiancée and first wife, Evalyn Katz (m. 1945-1967), who moved to New York City to act as his literary agent in 1942. In this capacity, Katz facilitated the publication of much of his early oeuvre. His collection &quot;V-Letter and Other Poems&quot;, written while Shapiro was stationed in New Guinea, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1945, while Shapiro was still in the military. From 1946 to 1947, he served as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, succeeding Louise Bogan; this position was reclassified by Congress in 1985 as the Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress.

Poems from his earlier books display a mastery of formal verse with a modern sensibility that viewed such topics as automobiles, houseflies, and drug stores as worthy of attention. In 1963, the poet/critic Randall Jarrell praised Shapiro&#x27;s work:Karl Shapiro&#x27;s poems are fresh and young and rash and live; their hard clear outlines, their flat bold colors create a world like that of a knowing and skillful neoprimitive painting, without any of the confusion or profundity of atmosphere, of aerial perspective, but with notable visual and satiric force. The poet early perfected a style, derived from Auden but decidedly individual, which he has not developed in later life but has temporarily replaced with the clear Rilke-like rhetoric of his Adam and Eve poems, the frankly Whitmanesque convolutions of his latest work. His best poem--poems like &quot;The Leg&quot;, &quot;Waitress&quot;, &quot;Scyros&quot;, &quot;Going to School&quot;, &quot;Cadillac&quot;--have a real precision, a memorable exactness of realization, yet they plainly come out of life&#x27;s raw hubbub, out of the disgraceful foundations, the exciting and disgraceful surfaces of existence.

In his later work, he repudiated the epochal influence of Ezra Pound (whom he voted against in the inaugural Bollingen Prize deliberations in 1949, citing the poet&#x27;s antisemitism) and T.S. Eliot, drawing instead upon the stylistic innovations of the Beat Generation and its progenitors, including Walt Whitman, D.H. Lawrence, Dylan Thomas, Henry Miller and William Carlos Williams. However, Morris Dickstein would later opine that his &quot;maverick role seemed strictly literary&quot; vis-à-vis the alternative lifestyles of such Sixties &quot;culture heroes&quot; as Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg. Nevertheless, this immersion led to experimentation with more open forms, beginning with &quot;The Bourgeois Poet&quot; (1964) and continuing with &quot;White-Haired Lover&quot; (1968). His interest in formal verse and prosody led to his writing multiple books on the subject, including the long poem &quot;Essay on Rime&quot; (1945), &quot;A Bibliography of Modern Prosody&quot; (1948), and &quot;A Prosody Handbook&quot; (with Robert Beum, 1965; reissued 2006). In his 1948 lecture, &quot;Poetry and Technique&quot;, the American poet Eli Siegel described Karl Shapiro as one of the &quot;technique boys,&quot; poets who were highly skilled at structures of prosody. His &quot;Selected Poems&quot; appeared in 1968. Shapiro also published one novel, &quot;Edsel&quot; (1971), and a two-volume memoir (1988–1990).

Although he never completed his undergraduate degree, Shapiro returned to Johns Hopkins as an associate professor of writing from 1947 to 1950. Based again in Chicago, he served as the full-time editor of &quot;Poetry&quot; from 1950 to 1956. During this period, he served as a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1955–1956) and as a visiting fellow at Indiana University (1956–1957). Thereafter, he returned to academia in earnest, serving as a professor of English and editor of &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot; at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for a decade (1956-1966). After briefly joining the faculty of the University of Illinois Chicago from 1966 to 1968, he moved to the University of California, Davis, where he became professor emeritus of English in 1985.

His other works include &quot;Person, Place and Thing&quot; (1942), the libretto to Hugo Weisgall&#x27;s opera &quot;The Tenor&quot; (1950; with Ernst Lert),&quot; To Abolish Children&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Old Horsefly&quot; (1993). Shapiro also received the 1969 Bollingen Prize, sharing the award with John Berryman.

==Death and legacy==
By 1984, Shapiro began to divide his time between California and an apartment in the Manhattan Valley section of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he initially spent at least half the year. He became a full-time resident of New York in 1994. In 1985, Richard Tillinghast of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; asserted that Shapiro had become &quot;more a name than a presence,&quot; and he obtained a settlement from the American Medical Association after the organization &quot;mistakenly included him in a list of writers who had committed suicide.&quot; As early as 1978, Shapiro had been erroneously characterized as a &quot;late U.S. poet&quot; in a &quot;New York Times&quot; crossword puzzle clue.

He died at a New York City hospice, aged 86, on May 14, 2000. Survivors included his third wife, Sophie Wilkens (m. 1985), along with three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. More recent editions of his work include &quot;The Wild Card: Selected Poems Early and Late&quot; (1998) and the John Updike-edited &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (2003). His last work, &quot;Coda: Last Poems,&quot; (2008) was recently published in a volume organized posthumously by editor Robert Phillips. The poems, divided into three sections according to love poems to Wilkens, poems concerning roses, and other various poems, were discovered in the drawers of Shapiro&#x27;s desk by his wife two years after his death.

<text>Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs), where the whites and yolks have been stirred, whipped, or beaten together (typically with salt, butter or oil, and sometimes water or milk, or other ingredients), then heated so that the proteins denature and coagulate, and they form into &quot;curds&quot;.

==History==
The earliest documented recipe for scrambled eggs was in the 14th-century Italian cookbook &quot;Libro della cucina&quot;.

==Preparation==
Only eggs are necessary to make scrambled eggs, but salt, water, chives, cream, crème fraîche, sour cream, grated cheese and other ingredients may be added as recipes vary. 

The eggs are cracked into a bowl with salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked. Alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. In &quot;Food in England&quot; (1954) Dorothy Hartley comments, &quot;There are two main schools: one (which I believe to be correct) breaks in the eggs direct, so that particles of clear white and clear yellow remain in the creamy mass. The other school beats the eggs together first, maintaining it gives a smoother texture&quot;. Elizabeth David (1960) takes the latter view: &quot;For scrambled eggs, unlike those for an omelette, the eggs should be very well beaten&quot;.
The mixture can be poured into a hot pan containing melted butter or oil, where it starts coagulating. The heat is turned down and the eggs are stirred as they cook. This creates small, soft curds of egg. A thin pan is preferable to prevent browning. With continuous stirring, and not allowing the eggs to stick to the pan, the eggs themselves will maintain the pan temperature at about the boiling point of water, until they coagulate. In their &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; (1961), Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child write, &quot;Scrambled eggs in French style are creamy soft curds that just hold their shape from fork to mouth. Their preparation is entirely a matter of stirring the eggs over gentle heat until they slowly thicken as a mass into a custard.&quot;

Alternatively, Escoffier describes using a double boiler as the heating source, which does not need adjustment as the direct heating method does. The eggs are directly placed in the cooker and mixed during the heating and not before. Cooking by this method prevents the eggs from browning while being cooked and gives aerated and creamy scrambled eggs. This method was used in the &quot;old classical kitchen&quot; and guarantees the eggs are always cooked perfectly; it is, however, more time-consuming than the modern skillet method, taking up to 40 minutes to ensure perfect quality.

Once the liquid has mostly set, additional ingredients such as ham, herbs, cheese, or cream may be folded in over low heat until incorporated. The eggs are usually slightly undercooked when removed from heat since the eggs will continue to set. If any liquid is seeping from the eggs (syneresis), this is a sign of undercooking, overcooking, or adding undercooked high-moisture vegetables.

Scrambled eggs can be cooked in a microwave oven, and can also be prepared using sous-vide cooking, which gives the traditional smooth creamy texture and requires only occasionally mixing during cooking. Another technique for cooking creamy scrambled eggs is to pipe steam into eggs with butter via a steam wand (as found on an espresso machine).

==Variations==


===Britain===
* In British style, the scrambled eggs are stirred thoroughly during cooking to give a soft, fine texture.
* Buttered eggs – a typically English dish, mentioned in 19th and early 20th-century literature; additional butter is melted and stirred into the egg mixture before cooking.
* Scotch woodcock – British variant of scrambled eggs, served over toast that has been spread with Gentleman&#x27;s Relish.

===France===
*There are more than a hundred variants of scrambled eggs (&quot;œufs brouilles&quot;) in French cuisine. Among the favoured additions are asparagus tips, crayfish, truffles, ham and mushrooms.

===Italy===
An Italian version of scrambled eggs: &quot;Uova stracciate al formaggio&quot;. In addition to the eggs and butter, cream is added, and when the eggs are cooked, grated Parmesan cheese is sprinkled on the top.

===Nigeria===
* The dish is called &quot;fried eggs&quot; in Nigeria. The mai shai stalls cook scrambled eggs to the point of being heavily crisp.
===Philippines===
* Poqui poqui – a Filipino dish consisting of grilled eggplants with sauteed garlic, tomatoes, and shallots and scrambled eggs.
===South America===
* Parrot eggs (&quot;Perico&quot; in Spanish) is a dish in Venezuelan cuisine and Colombian cuisine prepared with scrambled eggs, butter, sautéed diced onions, and tomatoes. White cheese is also sometimes used.
===Syria===
* Jaz maz [جظ مظ] – a Syrian variant of scrambled eggs made by first adding some oil, butter or ghee and frying some chopped tomatoes and onions. After, you add the eggs and spices (usually salt, pepper, red pepper powder, and sometimes the spice mix &#x27;sabaa baharat&#x27;). It is eaten with the traditional Syrian bread Khubz. It is typically eaten as breakfast but can be a lunch or dinner dish too.

===US===
* Eggs frizzle – scrambled egg dish made with chipped beef &quot;frizzled&quot; in butter before eggs are added to the pan and scrambled. To make a variation called &quot;Eggs a la Caracas&quot; the beef is frizzled with tomatoes, spices, and grated cheese.
* In American style, the eggs are scooped in towards the middle of the pan as they set, giving larger curds.
