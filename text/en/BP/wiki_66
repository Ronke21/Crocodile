<text>Archibald Alexander Hodge (July 18, 1823 – November 12, 1886), an American Presbyterian minister, was the principal of Princeton Seminary between 1878 and 1886.

==Biography==
He was born on July 18, 1823, to Sarah and Charles Hodge in Princeton, New Jersey. He was named after Charles&#x27; mentor, the first principal of Princeton Seminary, Archibald Alexander.
Hodge attended the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1841 and then Princeton Theological Seminary in 1847.

He served as a missionary in India for three years (1847–1850). He held pastorates at Lower West Nottingham, Maryland (1851–1855), Fredericksburg, Virginia (1855–1861), and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (1861–1864). In 1864 he accepted a call to the chair of systematic theology in Western Theological Seminary (later Pittsburgh Theological Seminary) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he remained until in 1877 he was called to Princeton to be the associate of his father, Charles Hodge, in the distinguished chair of systematic theology. He took on the full responsibilities of the chair of systematic theology in 1878.

He died on November 12, 1886, in Princeton, New Jersey, from &quot;a severe cold ... which settled in his kidneys&quot;.

==Influence==
At the time of his death, he was a trustee of the College of New Jersey and a leader in the Presbyterian Church. His interests extended beyond religion. He touched the religious world at many points. During the years immediately preceding his death he did not slacken his work, but continued his work of writing, preaching, lecturing, making addresses, coming into contact with men, influencing them, and by doing so widening the influence of Christianity. Among the most influential was an article titled &quot;Inspiration&quot; that began a series in the &quot;Presbyterian Review&quot; which established the discipline of biblical theology as a historical science. This article was coauthored with B. B. Warfield in 1880.

==Characteristics==

Hodge&#x27;s distinguishing characteristic as a theologian was his power as a thinker. He had a mind of singular acuteness, and though never a professed student of metaphysics, he was essentially and by nature a metaphysician. His theology was that of the Reformed confessions. He had no peculiar views and no peculiar method of organizing theological dogmas; in this he may be identified with his father, who claimed at the end of his life that he had taught and written nothing new. Though he taught the same theology that his father had taught before him, he was independent as well as reverent. His first book and that by which he is best known was his &quot;Outlines of Theology&quot; (New York City, 1860; enlarged ed., 1878; reprinted 1996, ), which was translated into Welsh, modern Greek, and Hindustani. &quot;The Atonement&quot; (Philadelphia, 1867; reprinted 1989, ) is still one of the best treatises on the subject. This was followed by his commentary on the Westminster Confession of Faith (1869, ), a very useful book, full of clear thinking and compact statement. He contributed some important articles to encyclopedias – Johnson&#x27;s, McClintock and Strong&#x27;s, and the Schaff-Herzog (the Schaff-Herzog encyclopedia furnished the kernel from which this article developed). He was one of the founders of the &quot;Presbyterian Review&quot;, to the pages of which he was a frequent contributor.

==Sermons==

In the pulpit, Hodge had few sermons, and he preached them frequently. They were never written nor deliberately planned. They grew from small beginnings and, as he went through the process of thinking them over as often as he preached them, they gradually became more elaborate.

<text>Archibald Alexander (April 17, 1772 – October 22, 1851) was an American Presbyterian theologian and professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He served for 9 years as the President of Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia and for 39 years as Princeton Theological Seminary&#x27;s first professor from 1812 to 1851.

==Early life==
Archibald Alexander was born at South River, Rockbridge County, Virginia, on April 17, 1772, son of William Alexander, a farmer of means. He was raised under the tuition and ministry of Presbyterian minister William Graham (1745–1799), a man who had been trained in theology by John Witherspoon.

His grandfather, of Scottish descent, came from Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1736, and after a residence of two years removed to Virginia. William, father of Archibald, was a farmer and trader. His nephew was the American novelist William Alexander Caruthers (1802–1846).

At the age of ten Archibald was sent to the academy of William Graham at Timber Ridge meetinghouse (since developed into Washington and Lee University), at Lexington. At the age of seventeen he became a tutor in the family of General Thomas Posey, of The Wilderness, twelve miles west of Fredericksburg, but after a few months resumed his studies with his former teacher. At this time a remarkable movement, still spoken of as &quot;the great revival,&quot; influenced his mind and he turned his attention to the study of divinity.

==Career==
On October 1, 1791, he was licensed to preach, ordained by the presbytery of Hanover on June 9, 1794, and for seven years was an itinerant pastor in Charlotte and Prince Edward counties.

By the time he was 21, Alexander was a preacher of the Presbyterian Church. He was appointed the president of Hampden–Sydney College, where he served from 1797 until a revolt among the students forced him to retire in 1806, and from 1807 to 1812 he was acted as pastor of the Old Pine street Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia.

The Princeton Theological Seminary was established at Princeton, New Jersey in 1812 and Alexander was appointed its first professor, inaugurated on August 12, 1812. In 1824, he helped to found the Chi Phi Society along with Robert Baird and Charles Hodge. In 1843, he returned to Washington College to deliver an alumni address, which was one of his many publications.

Alexander was one of the earliest supporters of the American Colonization Society that arranged the emigration of free Black and enslaved Black Americans to Liberia. In 1827, he and his close friend Samuel Miller defended the organization&#x27;s mission against attacks by John Brown Russwurm in Russwurm&#x27;s paper, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He later served as the Colonization Society&#x27;s vice president and wrote the most comprehensive history of the movement written before the twentieth century, &quot;A History of Colonization on the Western Coast of Africa&quot; (1846).

Samuel Miller became the second professor at the seminary and for 37 years Alexander and Miller were considered together as pillars of the Presbyterian Church in maintaining its doctrines. Charles Hodge, a famous student and successor of Alexander, named his son Archibald Alexander Hodge after his mentor.

===Archival collections===
The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has a collection of Archibald Alexander&#x27;s personal papers dating from 1819 to 1851 including outgoing correspondence, manuscript articles and lecture notes.

==Personal life==
On April 5, 1802, Alexander married Janetta Waddel, the daughter of a Presbyterian preacher, James Waddel (1739–1805), whose eloquence was described in William Wirt&#x27;s &quot;Letters of a British Spy&quot; (1803). Together, they were the parents of:

* James Waddel Alexander (1804–1859), who was a Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister. He wrote the life of his father, and edited his posthumous works.
* William Cowper Alexander (1806–1874), who served as president of the New Jersey State Senate and as the first president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
* Joseph Addison Alexander (1809–1860), who was a biblical scholar.
*Samuel Davies Alexander (1819-1894), a minister
* Henry Martyn Alexander (1822–1899), who was a lawyer and one of the Trustees of Princeton University.

Alexander died on October 22, 1851, at Princeton Township, New Jersey.

===Descendants===
His grandson, William C. Alexander (1848–1937), was an executive with the Equitable Life Assurance Society, author, and founder of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. His great-grandson, James Waddell Alexander II (1888–1971), was a noted mathematician and topologist.

<doc id="479421" wikidata="Q1700283" url="?curid=479421" title="J. Gresham Machen">
<text>John Gresham Machen (; 1881–1937) was an American Presbyterian New Testament scholar and educator in the early 20th century. He was the Professor of New Testament at Princeton Seminary between 1906 and 1929, and led a revolt against modernist theology at Princeton and formed Westminster Theological Seminary as a more orthodox alternative. As the Northern Presbyterian Church continued to reject conservative attempts to enforce faithfulness to the Westminster Confession, Machen led a small group of conservatives out of the church to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. When the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) rejected his arguments during the mid-1920s and decided to reorganize Princeton Seminary to create a liberal school, Machen took the lead in founding Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia (1929) where he taught New Testament until his death. His continued opposition during the 1930s to liberalism in his denomination&#x27;s foreign missions agencies led to the creation of a new organization, the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions (1933). The trial, conviction and suspension from the ministry of Independent Board members, including Machen, in 1935 and 1936 provided the rationale for the formation in 1936 of the OPC.

Machen is considered to be the last of the great Princeton theologians who had, since the formation of the seminary in the early 19th century, developed Princeton theology: a conservative and Calvinist form of Evangelical Christianity. Although Machen can be compared to the great Princeton theologians (Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, and B. B. Warfield), he was neither a lecturer in theology (he was a New Testament scholar) nor did he ever become the seminary&#x27;s principal.

Machen&#x27;s influence can still be felt today through the existence of the institutions that he founded: Westminster Theological Seminary, the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. In addition, his textbook on basic New Testament Greek is still used today in many seminaries, including PCUSA schools.

==Early life==
Machen was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 28, 1881, to Arthur Webster Machen and Mary Jones Gresham. Arthur, a Baltimore lawyer, was 45 and Mary was 24 when they married. While Arthur was an Episcopalian, Mary was a Presbyterian, and taught her son the Westminster Shorter Catechism from an early age. The family attended Franklin Street Presbyterian Church.

Machen attended a private college and received a classical education including Latin and Greek. He also learned to play the piano.

==Early adulthood==
In 1898, the 17-year-old Machen began studying at Johns Hopkins University for his undergraduate degree, and performed sufficiently well to gain a scholarship. He majored in classics and was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Machen was a brilliant scholar and in 1901 was elected to Phi Beta Kappa society after graduation.

Despite having some indecisiveness about his future, in 1902 Machen opted to study theology at Princeton Seminary, while simultaneously studying a Master of Arts in philosophy at Princeton University.

He also pursued theological studies in Germany for a year in 1905. In a letter to his father, he admitted being thrown into confusion about his faith because of the liberalism taught by Professor Wilhelm Herrmann. Although he had an enormous respect for Herrmann, his time in Germany and his engagement with Modernist theologians led him to reject the movement and embrace conservative Reformed theology more firmly than before.

==Pre-war period==

In 1906, Machen joined the Princeton Seminary as an instructor in the New Testament, after receiving an assurance that he would not have to sign a statement of faith. Among his Princeton influences were Francis Landey Patton, who had been the prosecutor in a nineteenth-century heresy trial, and B. B. Warfield, whom he described as the greatest man he had ever met. Warfield maintained that correct doctrine was the primary means by which Christians influenced the surrounding culture. He emphasized a high view of scripture and the defence of supernaturalism. It appears that under their influence Machen resolved his crisis of faith. In 1914, he was ordained and the next year he became an assistant professor of New Testament studies.

Machen did not serve &quot;conventionally&quot; during the First World War, but instead went to France with the YMCA to do volunteer work near and at the front—a task he continued for some time after the war. Though not a combatant, he witnessed first-hand the devastations of modern warfare. Suspicious of his family friend Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s project of spreading democracy and of imperialism, he was staunchly opposed to the war, and upon returning to the US, he saw that many of the provisions of, &quot;the Treaty of Versailles constituted an attack upon international and interracial peace... [W]ar will follow upon war in a wearisome progression.&quot;

==Post-war period==

===Princeton, 1918–1926===

After returning from Europe, Machen continued his work as a New Testament scholar at Princeton. During this period he gained a reputation as one of the few true scholars who was able to debate the growing prevalence of modernist theology whilst maintaining an evangelical stance.
&quot;The Origin of Paul&#x27;s Religion&quot; (1921) is perhaps Machen&#x27;s best known scholarly work. This book was a successful attempt at critiquing the Modernist belief that Paul&#x27;s religion was based mainly upon Greek philosophy and was entirely different from the religion of Jesus. &quot;Christianity and Liberalism&quot; (1923) is another of Machen&#x27;s books that critiqued theological modernism. The book compared conservative Protestantism to the rising popularity of modernist (or &quot;liberal&quot;) theology. He concluded that &quot;the chief modern rival of Christianity is Liberalism&quot;.
In &quot;What Is Faith?&quot; (1925) he set before him the pastoral task of anchoring faith in the historical fact of Christ&#x27;s atonement. He found liberal theology anti-intellectual, insofar as it spiritualized Christianity and treated it as merely an expression of individual experience, thus emptying the Bible and creeds of all definitive meaning.
These books, along with a number of others, placed Machen firmly in one theological camp within the Presbyterian Church. His work throughout the 1920s was divided between his time at Princeton and his political work with evangelical Presbyterians.
Despite his conservative theological beliefs, Machen was never able to fully embrace popularist fundamentalism either. His refusal to accept premillennialism and other aspects of fundamentalist belief was based upon his belief that Calvinist theology was the most biblical form of Christian belief—a theology that was generally missing from fundamentalism at the time. Moreover, Machen&#x27;s scholarly work and ability to engage with modernist theology was at odds with fundamentalism&#x27;s anti-intellectual attitude.

===Controversies===
In 1924 and 1925, relations among the Princeton faculty deteriorated when &quot;The Presbyterian&quot; questioned if there were two different parties on the faculty. In response Machen remarked that his differences with Charles Erdman related to the importance they attributed to doctrine. He noted that Erdman was tolerant of those in doctrinal error. Erdman wrote privately &#x27;he (Dwight L. Moody) knew that controversialists do not usually win followers for Christ.&#x27;

===Westminster Theological Seminary===
The 1929 General Assembly voted to reorganise Princeton Seminary and appointed two of the Auburn Affirmation signatories as trustees. The Auburn Affirmation was a response by liberals within the Northern Presbyterian Church that condemned the General Assembly&#x27;s response to the controversy arising out of Harry Emerson Fosdick&#x27;s May 1922 sermon &quot;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&quot; Machen and some colleagues withdrew and set up Westminster Theological Seminary to continue reformed orthodox theology.

===Orthodox Presbyterian Church===
In 1933, Machen, concerned about liberalism tolerated by Presbyterians on the mission field, formed The Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. The next Presbyterian General Assembly reaffirmed that Independent Board was unconstitutional and gave the associated clergy an ultimatum to break their links. When Machen and seven other clergy refused, they were suspended from the Presbyterian ministry. The controversy divided Machen from many of his fundamentalist friends including Clarence Macartney who dropped away at the prospect of schism. Ultimately, Machen withdrew from the Northern Presbyterian Church and formed what later came to be known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

In his book &quot;The Great Evangelical Disaster&quot;, Francis Schaeffer details the theological shift in American Christianity from conservatism to liberalism. In that discussion, Schaeffer describes how Machen&#x27;s &quot;defrocking&quot; rightly became front-page news in the secular media of the country. Schaeffer concludes: &quot;A good case could be made that the news about Machen was the most significant U.S. news in the first half of the twentieth century. It was the culmination of a long trend toward liberalism within the Presbyterian Church and represented the same trend in most other denominations&quot; (p. 35).

===Religion and politics===
Machen was suspicious of mixing religion and politics. He found attempts to establish a Christian culture by political means insensitive to minorities. He was even more concerned about the corrupting influence of politics on Christianity and saw the social gospel as a terrible warning. He opposed school prayer and Bible reading in public school. This position, however, implied that Christians should run their own schools.

Historian George Marsden has described Machen as &quot;radically libertarian. He opposed almost any extension of state power and took stands on a variety of issues. Like most libertarians, his stances violated usual categories of liberal or conservative.&quot; He opposed the establishment of a federal Department of Education, suggesting before a joint Congressional committee that government control of the children was the ultimate sacrifice of freedom (he was also opposed to the Child Labor Amendment, proposed in 1924). He was not against locally operated public schools per se, but feared the influence of materialist ideology and opposition to higher human aspirations. He also opposed Prohibition—a costly stance in an age when abstinence was almost a creed among Protestants. He was opposed to a foreign policy of imperialism and militarism.

==Death==
Much to the sadness of those who had been involved in the movements that he had led, Machen died on January 1, 1937, at the age of 55. Some commentators (notably Ned Stonehouse) point out that Machen&#x27;s &quot;constitution&quot; was not always strong, and that he was constantly &quot;burdened&quot; with his responsibilities at the time.

Machen had decided to honor some speaking engagements he had in North Dakota in December, 1936, but developed pleurisy in the exceptionally cold weather there. After Christmas, he was hospitalized for pneumonia and died on January 1, 1937. Just before his death, he dictated a telegram to long-time friend and colleague John Murray, the content of which reflected deeply his lifelong faith: &quot;I&#x27;m so thankful for active obedience of Christ. No hope without it.&quot; He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore. The stone covering his grave bears, very simply, his name, degree, dates, and the phrase &quot;Faithful Unto Death&quot;, in Greek.

The Baltimore-born journalist H. L. Mencken wrote an editorial on Machen in December 1931 and later contributed an obituary titled &quot;Dr. Fundamentalis&quot; that was published in the &quot; Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; on January 18, 1937. While disagreeing with Machen&#x27;s theology, Mencken nevertheless articulated a great respect and admiration for his intellectual ability. He noted that Machen &quot;fell out with the reformers who have been trying, in late years, to convert the Presbyterian Church into a kind of literary and social club, devoted vaguely to good works&quot;, and that &quot;though he lost in the end and was forced out of Princeton, it must be manifest that he marched off to Philadelphia with all the honors of war.&quot; Mencken also compared Machen to William Jennings Bryan, another well-known Presbyterian, with the statement, &quot;Dr. Machen himself was to Bryan as the Matterhorn is to a wart.&quot;

Machen left half his considerable estate to Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia. Giving $10,000 outright to the seminary, Dr. Machen provided that half of the balance, after certain bequests to his brothers and others were cared for, should be placed in the hands of five trustees to be held for the benefit of Westminster Seminary. Ten percent of the residuary estate was to go to the Independent Board. The will was drawn in 1935, before the establishing of The Presbyterian Guardian and before the organization of the new Church. The gross estate was estimated at $175,000.

<text>SubSpace is a 2D space shooter video game created in 1995 and released in 1997 by Virgin Interactive which was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Online Game of the Year Award in 1998. &quot;SubSpace&quot; incorporates quasi-realistic zero-friction physics into a massively multiplayer online game. 

The game is no longer operated by VIE; instead, fans and players of the game provide servers and technical updates. 

The action is viewed from above, which presents challenges very different from those of a three-dimensional game. The game has no built-in story or set of goals; players may enter a variety of servers, each of which have differing objectives, maps, sounds, and graphics.

&quot;SubSpace&quot; is considered an early entry in the massively multiplayer online genre due to its unprecedented player counts.

==History==
&quot;SubSpace&quot; evolved from a game originally called &quot;Sniper&quot; (1995), a project to test the effects and severity of lag in a massively multiplayer environment over dialup connections. 

After its creators realized its viability as an actual game, public beta testing began in February, 1996, and it became fully public later that year. 

The game was released commercially in December 1997 with a list price of US$27.99 for unlimited play, requiring no monthly or hourly fees. The game was originally developed by Burst, led by Jeff Petersen, Rod Humble and Juan Sanchez, for the US branch of the now-defunct Virgin Interactive. The title was showcased at E3 1997.

When the game was officially released, it was not a commercial success due to a lack of marketing and the relative newness of internet gaming. Two years of playing for free became problematic as many players refused to pay for a game that they had beta tested for two years, and instead opted to pirate the software.

SubSpace server software being distributed with the commercial release of the game allowed users to host their own servers on their own computers, enabling them to preserve the game.

Once VIE went under in 1998, many of its remaining US assets were purchased by Electronic Arts, but the &quot;SubSpace&quot; license was not. 

This caused all of the commercially hosted servers, including the official VIE servers, to eventually go offline permanently, and independent user-run servers became the only choice for hosting zones, including original zones previously hosted by VIE.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;SubSpace&quot; players control one of eight ships which are equipped with weapons and a variety of special abilities. These ships are the Warbird, Javelin, Spider, Leviathan, Terrier, Weasel, Lancaster, and Shark. Players interact with each other in zones, which are typically split into multiple arenas. Players in each arena are then divided into teams; friendly ships appear as yellow, while enemy ships appear blue. The keyboard is used exclusively for control of the ship and use of in-game chat functions.

Although each zone can have its own unique style of gameplay, certain basic gameplay mechanics are ubiquitous throughout all zones.

=== Map elements ===
Each arena uses a 1024x1024 map as the field of play. Some arenas may use the entire size of the map, while others may enclose the players in a smaller space. A coordinate system (A-T horizontal, 1–20 vertical) allows players to easily identify and communicate where they are on the map.

Maps may contain obstacles such as walls or asteroids which cannot be moved or destroyed. Maps often use gates, which open and close at random or regular intervals. If a player&#x27;s ship gets caught in a gate when it closes, the ship is relocated (&quot;warped&quot;) to a random location on the map.

Safe zones allow a players to evade enemies or simply take a break from the game. While in a safe zone, a ship cannot take damage but also cannot fire. Most safe zones have a time limit; players who stay in a safe zone too long are kicked from the game and must rejoin the zone. This prevents players from camping out in a safe zone and leaving their computer idle for an extended period of time in order to maintain their state in the game.

A flag or ball may be present as well. Their importance and role in the game depend on the zone.

The most common map elements in &quot;SubSpace&quot; are prizes, or &quot;greens&quot; (for their green color). Prizes allow players to upgrade their ships and gain special weapons or abilities. While prizes are generally plentifully scattered throughout the map, the upgrades or abilities they award are randomly selected by the zone.

=== Energy ===
Rather than dealing with ammunition counts and hit points separately, &quot;SubSpace&quot; combines both of these elements into a single unit of measure: energy. Each ship is equipped with a certain amount of energy, from which it must draw its health as well as its weapons power. When a ship&#x27;s energy is reduced from its capacity (whether from firing weapons or enduring enemy fire), the ship will automatically recharge back to its maximum capacity over a period of time; however, sustained weapons fire or enemy fire will inevitably cause the energy to drop lower.

Once the ship&#x27;s energy drops below zero, the ship is destroyed and the player is respawned elsewhere in the area. Any upgrades, weapons, or special abilities are lost. The energy mechanic forces players to be cautious of their energy usage, as reckless weapons fire could result in a quick death.

It is usually not possible for players to commit suicide; if a player&#x27;s own weapon causes more damage than that player has energy, the player&#x27;s energy will simply be reduced to one and begin recharging. However, suicide was possible in early beta versions of the game and the offline practice mode included with the original &quot;SubSpace&quot; client.

=== Ship Control ===
Thrust (Up for forward, Down for reverse) and rotation (Left for counter-clockwise, Right for clockwise) make up the basic movement of the ship. Ships maintain inertia once they are set in motion and cannot be brought to a complete stop except when in a safe zone. In addition, ships experience inelastic collisions with walls and asteroids but do not take damage from them. Ships do not collide with each other.

Players achieve their ship&#x27;s top speed by maintaining thrust. Each ship is also equipped with afterburners (Shift+Up/Down) which allow the ship to exceed its typical top speed; however, this gradually drains the ship&#x27;s energy. When afterburners are disengaged, the ship&#x27;s inertia returns to its normal top speed, not its speed with afterburners.

Ships can instantly warp (Ins) to a random location on the map. This action requires the ship to be at full energy, and its energy is totally drained once the warp is complete, although the ship will begin recharging its energy immediately.

Ships may also attach to other friendly ships. In this scenario, the attaching ship loses thrust control and becomes a weapons turret on the back of another ship. This is technically achieved by performing a warp, thus requiring full energy to attach and draining energy in the process. A turret ship takes damage like a normal ship and may detach at any time. In addition, a ship carrying turrets may detach one or all of them at any time.

=== Scoring ===
Players primarily increase their score by killing other players. Each ship has a bounty, which is increased by collecting prizes, killing enemies, or other in-game mechanics. When a ship is killed, its bounty is added to the killer&#x27;s score.

Each zone implements its own scoring system and may award bonuses for certain achievements.

=== Competitive Play ===
Many &quot;SubSpace&quot; players are organized into squads. These squadrons serve the same purpose as clans or teams do in other online games and allow players to cooperate and improve their skills, as well as to become more familiar with fellow players. In addition, many squads compete in competitive leagues hosted by various zones. Dueling is another favorite pastime and many zones have separate arenas for this purpose alone.

===Ships===
Within any given zone, a player can choose between up to eight different ships: Warbird, Javelin, Spider, Leviathan, Terrier, Weasel, Lancaster, and Shark.

=== Standard VIE Settings ===
&quot;Standard VIE Settings&quot;, SVS for short, (also referred to as Standard SubSpace Settings) is a server configuration conforming to the physics and rules used in non-special game types hosted by Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE) before the company&#x27;s dissolution. The term is sometimes used informally to describe servers which seek, through other means, to preserve the spirit of the game as it was originally played.

==Zones==
Gameplay can vary depending on the zone. Some zones are just free-for-all style gameplay, while others are capture the flag, or even powerball style. Zones typically have multiple public arenas, whose settings and maps are the same, which players are automatically distributed to upon joining the server. This serves to reduce crowding in highly populated arenas.

There are also numerous sub-arenas in &quot;SubSpace&quot;, and these sub-arenas can at times have greater populations than the &quot;main/public&quot; arenas. They differ from the main public arenas, in the sense that they may have their own settings, map, graphics, and bots (if required – or modules in ASSS zones).

===Flag Games===

*War – Standard flag game whose name is derived from its original zone (War Zone). The objective is to claim all flags for one&#x27;s own team. Flags can be picked up by opponents only. Flags that are picked up are dropped after a set time. Flagging games usually involve bases to store flags and are heavily team-oriented.
*Bounty Rabbit – One player is the rabbit, and has the &#x27;flag&#x27;. The rabbit&#x27;s kills are worth 101 points while a regular players&#x27; kills are only worth 1 point. Kill the current rabbit to become the new rabbit. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. This game is usually run by bots in a main arena or sub-arenas.
*Turf – Territorial flag game in which flags are located at specific locations around the map. Ownership is claimed by simply passing over the flag by any player. Turf games can either be won or involve periodic point rewards.
*Basing – Similar to Turf, except there is a base with one flag. The team that controls that flag controls the base, and thus the base is often completely populated by the controlling team. Trench Wars is an example of a popular basing game.
*Running – Flags in running zones do not have drop timers, and may only be claimed by killing an opponent carrying flags or picking up neutral flags. Variants include Rabbit Chase.

===Kill Games===

&quot;Kill&quot; games have no &#x27;rounds&#x27; or &#x27;games&#x27;; the objective is simply to kill as many opponents as possible while keeping one&#x27;s own deaths to a minimum. The original Alpha and Chaos zones followed this basic premise.

However, some zones offer their own variants of this style of gameplay:

*King of the Hill – Each player starts off with a crown, which may be lost if the set amount of time runs out. A player&#x27;s timer, which is displayed at the top right of the screen, is reset every time they kill another player. However, if a player has already lost their crown, they may only regain it by either killing a flagger with a crown (sometimes marked by a red dot on the radar), or by destroying any two players. Generally though, flaggers with low bounty do not give others their crown. The game is then won when there is only one crowned player left standing.
*Speed – Each round of a Speed game has a time limit. The winner of a round is the player with the most kills for the round. In Speed Zone, ships began with a higher &quot;bounty&quot; (and more weapons and other power ups) than in other zones. Speed Zone proved to be less popular than the Jackpot/Running, Chaos, or &quot;flag&quot; zone games and support was discontinued shortly after &quot;SubSpace&quot; went to retail.

===Ball Games===

Ball games involve taking control of a ball and scoring it in the opposing team&#x27;s goal. Players cannot fire weapons or warp while carrying the ball, and can only carry the ball for a few seconds. Before the ball timer runs out, they must pass the ball to a teammate (using Ins, Tab, or Ctrl keys), or the ball will shoot out from their ship in a random direction. If a player dies while carrying the ball, the ball is dropped immediately and may be picked up by anyone. A team wins a game when they achieve a certain number of goals, or the game may be timed, with the highest-scoring team winning when time expires.

*Hockey simulates futuristic ice hockey in a space setting. the &quot;ball&quot; is the equivalent of the hockey puck. Each ship&#x27;s settings have been modified to fit that ship into a unique role on the team; for instance, Lancasters and Sharks are &quot;goalie&quot; ships. the Warbird, Javelin and Weasel are Forwards, Spiders and Terriers make up the midfield, and the Levithan is a defensive beast. The rules of the game are based on real hockey rules with some variations due to the 2d nature of the game.
*Powerball (Soccer) – is similar to hockey, in that it also features two teams (Warbirds and Javelins) and goals at opposite ends of a symmetrical map. Powerball primarily uses SVS settings, except that the Warbird and Javelin have identical ship settings, creating two evenly matched teams. Each ship starts with 100 bounty and comes &quot;greened&quot; with a number of basic upgrades and randomly selected special abilities (e.g. burst, repel, etc.). It is not possible to choose any other type of ship. Although scoring goals is the primary objective of Powerball, shooting and killing other players is very much an important part of the game.

===Customization===
A zone is a server to which players can connect using a client. Perhaps the most attractive feature of &quot;SubSpace&quot; is the extremely high degree of customization that zone sysops can implement. Almost every element of the game can be replaced, from the ship graphics to colors and sounds. Apart from a few basic settings, many game settings, such as ship speeds, energy levels, and such, can be changed. This allows a vast variety of zones to exist.

== Game software ==
&quot;SubSpace&quot; utilizes a client–server architecture. Initially, both the client and server were provided by VIE. The client executable was titled SubSpace while the server was called SubGame. A new client, titled Continuum, was created by reverse engineering without access to the original source code by the players PriitK (one of the creators of Kazaa) and Mr Ekted. The original server software, heavily modified, is still the most common, although an open source alternative, A Small Subspace Server, is now available.

=== Continuum client ===

Continuum, first released in 2001, was developed as a clone of the SubSpace client, but now contains new original features exclusive to the client over the original. Continuum is the official client of the &quot;SubSpace&quot; Central Billing Server. It was developed primarily because of the original SubSpace client&#x27;s failure to prevent hacking. As such, it has been adopted by several zones as a requirement in order to play.

=== A Small SubSpace Server ===
ASSS (A Small SubSpace Server) is an open source server designed for use on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, but can be configured for use on Microsoft Windows. Both are downloadable from Bitbucket. ASSS is under active development.

=== Re-release ===
Continuum was released in the fan-reconstructed variant in digital distribution on Steam on July 3, 2015.

==Reception==
In 1997 &quot;Next Generation&quot; named &quot;SubSpace&quot; as number four on their &quot;Top 10 Online Game Picks&quot;, reasoning that &quot;Its minimal bandwidth requirements mean pretty damn good gameplay, and the software pings the various arenas to see where you&#x27;ll receive the lowest latency. Nicely done: simple, addictive, and really multiplayer.&quot; During the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;SubSpace&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Online Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

<doc id="479426" wikidata="Q1399368" url="?curid=479426" title="Ron Kirk">
<text>Ronald Kirk (born June 27, 1954) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the United States Trade Representative from 2009 to 2013, as the 97th secretary of state of Texas, and as the 56th mayor of Dallas from 1995 to 2002. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Born in Austin, Texas, Kirk is a graduate of Austin&#x27;s John H. Reagan High School, Austin College, and the University of Texas School of Law. From 1994 to 1995, Kirk worked as the secretary of state of Texas, until he was elected as the mayor of Dallas, where he served from 1995 to 2002 and was the first African-American to hold either of those positions. He ran for the United States Senate in 2002, but was defeated by Republican opponent John Cornyn. After his defeat, Kirk worked as a partner at the Houston-based law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins and worked as a lobbyist for Energy Future Holdings and Merrill Lynch.

Kirk was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as U.S. Trade Representative and on March 18, 2009, and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a 92–5 confirmation vote. On January 22, 2013, Kirk announced that he would be stepping down as U.S. Trade Representative

==Early life and career==
Born in Austin, Texas, Kirk is the youngest of four children; his father was a U.S. postal worker and the family was politically active. He grew up in a predominantly black community, and attended Austin&#x27;s public schools. He was a leader in high school, and was elected student council president in his senior year at John H. Reagan High School.

Kirk attended Austin College, graduating with a degree in both political science and sociology in 1976. He then went to the University of Texas School of Law. Upon receiving his Juris Doctor in 1979, he practiced law until 1981 when he left to work in the office of then-Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen. In 1983, Kirk returned to Texas to lobby the state legislature in Austin, first as an attorney with the city of Dallas, and later with a law firm.

Kirk is the nephew of civil rights leader William Astor Kirk.

==Texas political career==
In 1994, Kirk worked for then-Texas Governor Ann Richards as Secretary of State of Texas. The following year, Kirk ran for mayor of Dallas. With support of Dallas&#x27; business community and influential members of the city&#x27;s African American community, Kirk was successful in his bid and became the first African American mayor of Dallas, Texas, while winning 62 percent of the total vote in 1995.

During his tenure as mayor, Kirk earned the reputation of being a coalition-builder, managing to keep the always-tumultuous Dallas City Council and Dallas School Board together. Under his leadership, he proposed the &quot;Dallas Plan&quot;, a vision for the next 25 years, which included the controversial Trinity River Project, a $246 million plan that called for constructing a network of parks and privately owned toll roads in the flood plain of the Trinity River. He also pushed the construction of the American Airlines Center, whose opening he oversaw in 2002.

In 1999, Kirk was re-elected as mayor of Dallas in a landslide with 74 percent of the vote. The only incident in the campaign was a radio campaign ad that used music from &quot;Star Trek&quot; and described Kirk as the &quot;captain of the Dallas Enterprise&quot;, citing the city&#x27;s bond program, the new sports arena and new roads. The ad was pulled after Paramount&#x27;s lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter.

In 2002, Kirk resigned as mayor of Dallas in order to run for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Phil Gramm. Facing then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn; Kirk lost with 43 percent of the vote to Cornyn&#x27;s 55 percent.

==Post-mayoral career==
Following his failed bid for Senate, Kirk returned to the law firm of Gardere Wynne Sewell in Dallas. He was briefly a candidate for chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the 2004 election. Later he was a partner with the Houston-based law firm Vinson and Elkins, where, according to Texans for Public Justice, he was, as of March 2007, one of the four highest paid lobbyists for Energy Future Holdings Corporation.

During the Democratic National Convention, Kirk came out in favor of establishing the U.S. Public Service Academy as a civilian counterpart to the military service academies.

==U.S. Trade Representative==
Although there was speculation that Kirk would be appointed Secretary of Transportation by President Barack Obama, he was given the position of Trade Representative.

===Nomination===
As a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), his selection drew criticism from opponents of free trade policies. His nomination ran into further controversy when it was revealed that he owed $9,975 in back taxes. As compensation for speeches he gave from 2004 to the present, he had $37,750 of payments made directly to a scholarship fund at Austin College. Kirk should have included the $37,750 payments with his gross income and then claimed a charitable deduction for the same amount. Kirk also claimed deductions for three years of season tickets to the Dallas Mavericks as qualifying entertainment expenses. In order to claim a qualifying entertainment expense, the Internal Revenue Service requires written documentation of the time, place, business purpose, name, and business relationship of the person being entertained, records that Kirk did not keep for almost half of the basketball games. Kirk&#x27;s deductions for tax and accounting fees were also too large.

The U.S. Senate confirmed Kirk as United States Trade Representative on March 18, 2009, with a vote of 92 in favor and five opposed and he was sworn in the same day. Kirk was formally sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on March 20, 2009. Kirk is the first person of African American descent to hold the position of United States Trade Representative.

===Work as U.S. Trade Representative===

As the U.S. Trade Representative, Kirk received the formal title of Ambassador and was a member of the President&#x27;s Cabinet.

Much of his work, at least as publicly reported, focuses on issues relating to the development and enforcement of intellectual property law in the United States and abroad, especially as they relate to trade policy. This work includes the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaties.

====China====
Kirk has repeatedly raised concerns of American businesses that China is not properly enforcing intellectual property rights of American companies doing business there. It has been alleged that the Chinese government takes IT secrets of international companies operating there and passes them on to local companies to boost their competitiveness Kirk has also been critical of China&#x27;s internet censorship policies, and he is reported to be considering whether to challenge such censorship regulations in the WTO as an unfair barrier to trade; it would be the first case of its kind.

====ACTA in South Korea====

Kirk has been cited as the U.S. agent who convinced South Korea to adopt and enforce an early draft of the secretly negotiated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The impacts in South Korea have been dramatic; tens of thousands of citizens have had their websites taken off of the Internet because of copyright infringement.

====Trans-Pacific Partnership====
In May 2012, a group of 30 legal scholars, critical of the USTR&#x27;s &quot;biased and closed&quot; Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaty negotiation process and proposed intellectual property-related provisions, publicly called upon Kirk to uphold democratic ideals by reversing the &quot;dialing back&quot; of stakeholder participation and to release negotiating texts for public scrutiny. The law professors claimed that leaked documents show that the USTR is &quot;pushing numerous standards that [...] could require changes in current U.S. statutory law&quot; and that the proposal is &quot;manifestly unbalanced—it predominantly proposes increases in proprietor rights, with no effort to expand the limitations and exceptions to such rights that are needed in the U.S. and abroad to serve the public interest&quot;. The group claimed that the negotiations excluded stakeholders such as &quot;consumers, libraries, students, health advocacy or patient groups, or others users of intellectual property&quot; and that it only offered &quot;minimal representation of other affected businesses, such as generic drug manufacturers or Internet service providers&quot;.

Kirk initially responded that he was &quot;strongly offended by the assertion that our process has been non-transparent and lacked public participation&quot; and that it was actually far more transparent than the negotiations for prior free trade agreements.

This prompted further criticism from the academic group that free-trade agreement negotiations, notorious for their secrecy, are &quot;the wrong standard for assessing the legitimacy of the TPP intellectual property chapter negotiations. This is because the IP chapter in the TPP, like ACTA, is not a trade agreement. It does not adjust tariffs and quotas—it sets new international limits on domestic regulation, regardless of whether such regulation discriminates against, or even affects, trade&quot;. The group further reiterated its claim that the secretive process is antithetical to the ideals of democracy, and is &quot;no way to engender trust and faith in international law making with such a broad impact&quot;. One critic pointed out that despite Kirk&#x27;s claim of transparency in the process, public-interest stakeholders have been completely excluded. Another accused Kirk of sidestepping the issue of transparency, and pointed out that transparency is less about the degree of public input, and more about &quot;the flow of information the other way—information about the workings of government being visible to the people it is supposed to represent&quot;.

In a subsequent interview with Reuters, Kirk defended the secrecy, saying he believes the USTR has conducted &quot;the most engaged and transparent process as we possibly could&quot;, but that &quot;some measure of discretion and confidentiality&quot; are needed &quot;to preserve negotiating strength and to encourage our partners to be willing to put issues on the table they may not otherwise&quot;. He dismissed the &quot;tension&quot; as natural and noted that when the Free Trade Area of the Americas drafts were released, negotiators were subsequently unable to reach a final agreement.

On January 22, 2013, Kirk announced that he would be stepping down as the U.S. Trade Representative.

<text>The Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) is a confessional Presbyterian denomination located primarily in the United States, with additional congregations in Canada, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. It was founded by conservative members of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), who objected to the rise of Liberal and Modernist theology in the 1930s. The OPC is considered to have had an influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size.

==History==
The Orthodox Presbyterian Church was founded in 1936, largely through the work of John Gresham Machen. Machen, who, prior to this time was a PCUSA minister, had a longstanding distrust of liberalism in Christianity, as typified by the Auburn Affirmation. He and others founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929 in response to rising liberal sentiments at Princeton Theological Seminary, and in 1933, Machen formed the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, due to his concerns around tolerance of liberal theology on the PCUSA mission field.
Machen&#x27;s views were met with opposition. In 1935, the PCUSA General Assembly declared Machen&#x27;s Independent Board unconstitutional, and gave the associated clergy an ultimatum to break their ties with it. When Machen and seven other clergy did not disavow the Independent Board, they were suspended from PCUSA ministry.

In light of these events, Machen and a group of likeminded ministers, elders, and laymen met in Philadelphia on June 11, 1936, to form what they then called the Presbyterian Church of America (not to be confused with the Presbyterian Church in America, or PCA, which formed in 1973), with Machen as the first moderator. Other key figures at this time include Ned B. Stonehouse, J. Oliver Buswell, and Edward Joseph Young.

Machen died shortly thereafter in January 1937. Later that year, a faction led by Carl McIntire broke away to form Bible Presbyterian Church, affirming total abstinence from alcohol and premillennialism.

In 1939, after PCUSA filed a lawsuit against the fledgling denomination for its name choice, the denomination adopted its current name, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (or, OPC).

In 1961, the OPC published the Trinity Hymnal. It also publishes a journal called &quot;Ordained Servant&quot;.

Since its founding, the OPC has produced numerous influential figures, including Scottish theologian John Murray, Dutch theologian Geerhardus Vos, American theologians Richard B. Gaffin, Jr., Edmund P. Clowney, Loraine Boettner, and Meredith Kline, historian D.G. Hart, and presuppositional theologians Cornelius Van Til and Greg Bahnsen.

==Doctrine==
The Orthodox Presbyterian Church traces its doctrinal beliefs to the Reformation, and particularly the theology of the French Reformer John Calvin. After his death, Calvin&#x27;s doctrines were developed and set forth by a 17th-century assembly of British theologians in the Westminster Standards (which include the Westminster Confession of Faith, and the Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms). The OPC thus holds to the Westminster Standards (with the American revisions of 1788) for doctrine and practice.

The OPC provides the following summary of its doctrine:
* The Bible, having been inspired by God, is entirely trustworthy and without error. Therefore, we are to believe and obey its teachings. The Bible is the only source of special revelation for the church today.
* The one true God is personal, yet beyond our comprehension. He is an invisible spirit, completely self-sufficient and unbounded by space or time, perfectly holy and just, and loving and merciful. In the unity of the Godhead there are three &quot;persons&quot;: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
* God created the heavens and the earth, and all they contain. He upholds and governs them in accordance with his eternal will. God is sovereign—in complete control—yet this does not diminish human responsibility.
* Because of the sin of the first man, Adam, all mankind is corrupt by nature, dead in sin, and subject to the wrath of God. But God determined, by a covenant of grace, that sinners may receive forgiveness and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. Faith in Christ has always been the only way of salvation, in both Old Testament and New Testament times.
* The Son of God took upon himself a human nature in the womb of the virgin Mary, so that in her son Jesus the divine and human natures were united in one person. Jesus Christ lived a sinless life and died on a cross, bearing the sins of, and receiving God&#x27;s wrath for, all those who trust in him for salvation (his chosen ones). He rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, where he sits as Lord and rules over his kingdom (the church). He will return to judge the living and the dead, bringing his people (with glorious, resurrected bodies) into eternal life, and consigning the wicked to eternal punishment.
* Those whom God has predestined unto life are effectually drawn to Christ by the inner working of the Spirit as they hear the gospel. When they believe in Christ, God declares them righteous (justifies them), pardoning their sins and accepting them as righteous, not because of any righteousness of their own, but by imputing Christ&#x27;s merits to them. They are adopted as the children of God and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies them, enabling them increasingly to stop sinning and act righteously. They repent of their sins (both at their conversion and thereafter), produce good works as the fruit of their faith, and persevere to the end in communion with Christ, with assurance of their salvation.
* Those whom God has predestined unto death are ignored by God. God does nothing to prevent them from sinning nor does he help them obtain salvation. The fate of the reprobate are to lead sinful wicked lives and suffer eternal damnation upon death. 
* Believers strive to keep God&#x27;s moral law, which is summarized in the Ten Commandments, not to earn salvation, but because they love their Savior and want to obey him. Good works are a gift prepared by God for his people. God is the Lord of the conscience, so that men are not required to believe or do anything contrary to, or in addition to, the Word of God in matters of faith or worship.
* Christ has established his church, and particular churches, to gather and perfect his people, by means of the ministry of the Word, the sacraments of baptism (which is to be administered to the children of believers, as well as believers) and the Lord&#x27;s Supper (in which the body and blood of Christ are spiritually present to the faith of believers), and the disciplining of members found delinquent in doctrine or life. Christians assemble on the Lord&#x27;s Day to worship God by praying, hearing the Word of God read and preached, singing psalms and hymns, and receiving the sacraments.

Despite affirming the Westminster standards, OPC pastors and presbyteries teach a range of doctrines on the biblical creation accounts, from non-evolutionary framework and analogical interpretations to young earth. There is similar variability in terms of eschatology.

== Demographics==
At the 2024 General Assembly, the OPC reported 599 ministers and 33,520 members. 

The OPC has 17 Presbyteries across Canada and the United States: Central Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Southern New York, the Dakotas, Michigan and Ontario, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New Jersey, New York and New England, Northern California and Nevada, Northwest, Ohio, Philadelphia, South, Southeast, Southern California, Southwest, and Wisconsin and Minnesota.

===Race===
In the early 1970s, the General Assembly commissioned a &#x27;Report of the Committee on Problems of Race&#x27;, which stated that the OPC was a &quot;largely white&quot; denomination, due to losing &quot;the allegiance of blacks during the ecclesiastical discrimination against blacks in the post-civil war period&quot; and ecclesiastical &quot;neglect&quot; of minority groups. The report recommended more outreach to minority and urban areas.

As of 2019, there is one black minister in the OPC. The OPC also has at least 6 Asian ministers, 3 Middle Eastern ministers, and 8 South American ministers.

==American politics==
OPC ministers have a variety of political views. Carl Trueman, an ordained minister in the OPC, has authored &quot;Republocrat: Confessions of a Liberal Conservative&quot; (pub. 2010). Greg Bahnsen was also a key figure in the Christian Reconstructionism movement, with an emphasis of applying God&#x27;s law to contemporary civil and legal matters.

===Abortion===
The 39th General Assembly, meeting in 1972, adopted a statement on abortion that included the affirmation that &quot;voluntary abortion, except possibly to save the physical life of the mother, is in violation of the Sixth Commandment (Exodus 20:13).&quot;

===Military===
In 1993, the denomination petitioned then President Bill Clinton to continue to disallow homosexuals to serve in the military. The petition states that: &quot;The practice of homosexuality is a reproach to any nation. It undermines the family, and poses a substantial threat to the general health, safety and welfare of our citizens. Your own Christian background ought to demonstrate to you the practical benefits of upholding the biblical stand against homosexuality, especially in light of the current epidemic of AIDS and other diseases spread through homosexual conduct.&quot;

The 68th General Assembly in 2001 declared “that the use of women in military combat is both contrary to nature and inconsistent with the Word of God,” 

===Immigration===
In 2006-2007, a study committee formed by the General Assembly created a report that concluded that &quot;the church should never turn its back on fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, whether they are legally or illegally in the country. We should be willing to see to the spiritual and physical needs of anyone who comes to the church.&quot; The report nonetheless recommended that illegal immigrants repent of their illegal activity.

== Governance ==
The Orthodox Presbyterian Church has a Presbyterian polity. The offices of the church and corresponding duties can be found in the OPC Book of Church Order.

=== Session ===
A Session consists of the ministers and ruling elders of an individual congregation. The duties of the Session include overseeing public worship, the administration of Baptism and The Lord&#x27;s Supper, the addition, removal, and discipline of members, and keeping records of membership.

=== Presbytery ===
All of the members of local congregations and its ministers are organized by geography into a regional church, and the presbytery serves as its governing body. The presbytery is composed of all of the ministers and ruling elders of the various congregations in the regional church, and presbytery meetings are to consist of all ministers and one ruling elder from each respective session.

The duties of the presbytery include overseeing evangelism and resolving questions regarding church discipline. The presbytery also takes candidates for ministry under its care, and examines, licenses and ordains them. It also, if necessary, can remove a minister.

=== General Assembly ===
The OPC&#x27;s General Assembly is the supreme judicatory, and as such, it is to resolve all doctrinal and disciplinary issues that have not been resolved by the sessions and presbyteries. The other duties of the General Assembly include organizing regional churches, calling ministers and licentiates to missionary or other ministries, and reviewing the records from the presbyteries. It also arranges internship training for prospective ministers, and oversees diaconal needs.

The General Assembly meets at least once a year, and is to have, at maximum, 155 voting commissioners, including the moderator and stated clerk of the previous General Assembly, and ministers and ruling elders representing their respective presbyteries.

=== Women in ministry ===
The OPC does not ordain women as pastors, elders, or deacons. At least one congregation allowed women to serve as unordained deaconesses, but that congregation has since closed.

===Missions===
There are 38 mission works and eight active foreign mission fields in the OPC today: in China, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Haiti, Quebec, Uganda, Ukraine, and Uruguay. The OPC also has two missionaries currently serving in Japan. Japan was, historically, one of the oldest OPC mission works, but has since closed. One of the OPC&#x27;s goals is that &quot;indigenous Reformed churches be established which will provide fellowship and instruction, and make the gospel known in its own culture and in others&quot;.

The OPC&#x27;s Committee on Home Missions and Church Extension also serves to help sustain and plant congregations in the United States and Canada. Their duty is to aid presbyteries in planting congregations, finding pastors, purchasing property and church buildings, and assisting home missionaries.

==Ecumenical relations==
In 1975, the OPC became a founding member of the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council (NAPARC). Through NAPARC, the OPC enjoys fraternal relations with the PCA, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, the Reformed Church in the United States, the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, the United Reformed Churches in North America, the Canadian and American Reformed Churches and several other confessional Continental Reformed and Presbyterian Churches in the United States and Canada.

The OPC is also a member of the International Conference of Reformed Churches (ICRC), which includes Reformed &amp; Presbyterian denominations from across the globe.

Outside NAPARC and ICRC, the OPC has relations with the Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church, the Reformed Church in Japan, the Presbyterian Church in Japan and the Presbyterian Church of Brazil.

<doc id="479441" wikidata="Q6770501" url="?curid=479441" title="Mark and Lard">
<text>Mark and Lard is the stage name of Mark Radcliffe (Mark) and Marc Riley (Lard), who presented various weekday shows on BBC Radio 1 from 1991 to March 2004.

==Career==
Radcliffe, then a Radio 1 producer, began presenting specialist shows on the network in 1991, namely &quot;Out on Blue Six&quot;, &quot;The Guest List&quot; and &quot;Skyman&quot;. During this time, he also hosted &quot;Hit the North&quot;, a weekly BBC Radio 5 music and comedy show from Manchester with Riley as its researcher, and latterly, co-producer and presenter. Riley also presented his own series, &quot;Cult Radio&quot;, during the summer of 1993.

On 25 October 1993, the pair transferred to Radio 1 full-time and began presenting a late night show from 10pm-midnight on Mondays-Thursdays, replacing Nicky Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Into the Night&quot;. The &quot;Graveyard Shift&quot; featured a mix of comedy sketches, poetry readings, live sessions and guests, including regular contributors such as Mark Kermode, Mark Lamarr, Stuart Maconie, Simon Armitage, Ian McMillan and Katie Puckrik.

They had presented the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot; show as stand-ins for Chris Evans, and after his departure from Radio 1, Mark and Lard took over the flagship show on 17 February 1997. But low ratings led to the pair being replaced; they presented their last show in that time slot on 10 October 1997. Their eight-month tenure was the shortest of any Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Mark and Lard moved to an early afternoon slot (2-4pm, later 1-3pm), where they continued until 26 March 2004.

Throughout the afternoon show&#x27;s run, regular features included spoof phone-in quizzes such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Sausage Roll&quot;, &quot;Circle of Chance&quot; and &quot;Fish or Fowl&quot;. Other items on the show included &quot;Downcount&quot;, &quot;Lard&#x27;s Classic Cuts&quot; and &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. The pair became well known for a stock of catchphrases such as &quot;Biggedy Biggedy Bong&quot;, &quot;Stop...carry on!&quot;, &quot;By Jovi&quot;, &quot;Cabbage Garden&quot; and &quot;Wickedy Wickedy Warp&quot;. One of the many characters on the show was &#x27;Fat Harry White&#x27; (Radcliffe with a vocoder) – a thinly disguised parody of soul singer Barry White, this character was so successful he was given his own CD in 1998, entitled &quot;Hmmm Baby&quot; (The Seduction Selection, which was also his catchphrase) – it peaked at number 83 in the UK charts. During the afternoon show&#x27;s run, Mark and Lard went on to win three Golds at the Radio Academy Awards.

Throughout their Radio 1 career, the pair produced and broadcast their shows from the BBC North West studios at New Broadcasting House, Manchester – in contrast to the network&#x27;s London-based content. The studios, closed in November 2011 and later demolished, were invariably dubbed on-air and in Radio Times&#x27; schedule billings as &quot;The Palace of Glittering Delights&quot;.

==Shirehorses==
Mark and Lard are also the creators of the spoof rock band the Shirehorses, who released two CD albums:
*&quot;The Worst...Album in the World...Ever...EVER!&quot; - The title is a play on &quot;The Best... Album in the World...Ever!&quot; compilation series.
*&quot;Our Kid Eh&quot; – The title is a combination of the contemporary Radiohead album &quot;Kid A&quot;, and the northern phrase &#x27;our Kid&#x27;.

==Leaving Radio 1==
In February 2004 the pair announced they were leaving Radio 1, with Radcliffe moving to BBC Radio 2 and Riley moving to BBC Radio 6 Music. Their last show was broadcast on 26 March 2004 and featured a guest appearance by Travis, messages of commiseration from Neil Hannon, Radiohead, Blur (Damon Albarn composed a special song but &quot;broke down in tears&quot; before finishing it) and Kelly Jones of The Stereophonics, whom they&#x27;d frequently insulted during the show&#x27;s run. They also received a bouquet of flowers from Paul McCartney. At the end of their last show, Riley sat in the silent studio sighing. Radcliffe convinces him to buck up and come to the pub to buy him a drink. But they had time for a swift half a catchphrase: &quot;Stop!&quot; Then the door closed and the show was over. It was followed by a silence of some twenty seconds causing the network to switch to the emergency tape; this was believed to be a final opportunity to make a nuisance of themselves, but was a result of show overrunning and studio staff in London not being in place when the show finally ended.

They subsequently worked together on the &quot;Mark &amp; Lard&#x27;s Football Nightmares&quot; DVD. They had previously presented &quot;Match of the Nineties&quot;, which showed highlights of English football seasons from 1989 to 1999, during the summer of 1999.

==Carry On: An Evening with Mark and Lard==
On Thursday 25th January 2024, Craig Charles, on his BBC 6 Music radio show, announced that there would be a one off live show where Mark and Lard would reunite on 24th March 2024 at The Bowden Rooms, Altrincham with a live stream going out at the same time on YouTube.

<doc id="479444" wikidata="Q501908" url="?curid=479444" title="Arteriole">
<text>An arteriole is a small-diameter blood vessel in the microcirculation that extends and branches out from an artery and leads to capillaries.

Arterioles have muscular walls (usually only one to two layers of smooth muscle cells) and are the primary site of vascular resistance. The greatest change in blood pressure and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to capillaries. This function is extremely important because it prevents the thin, one-layer capillaries from exploding upon pressure. The arterioles achieve this decrease in pressure, as they are the site with the highest resistance (a large contributor to total peripheral resistance) which translates to a large decrease in the pressure.

==Structure==
In a healthy vascular system, the endothelium lines all blood-contacting surfaces, including arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, capillaries, and heart chambers. This healthy condition is promoted by the ample production of nitric oxide by the endothelium, which requires a biochemical reaction regulated by a complex balance of polyphenols, various nitric oxide synthase enzymes and L-arginine. In addition, there is direct electrical and chemical communication via gap junctions between the endothelial cells and the vascular smooth muscle.

==Physiology==
===Blood pressure===
Blood pressure in the arteries supplying the body is a result of the work needed to pump the cardiac output (the flow of blood pumped by the heart) through the vascular resistance, sometimes termed total peripheral resistance. An increase in the tunica media to luminal diameter ratio has been observed in hypertensive arterioles (arteriolosclerosis) as the vascular wall thickens and/or luminal diameter decreases.

The up and down fluctuation of the arterial blood pressure is due to the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output and determined by the interaction of the stroke volume versus the volume and elasticity of the major arteries.

The decreased velocity of flow in the capillaries increases the blood pressure, due to Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. This induces gas and nutrients to move from the blood to the cells, due to the lower osmotic pressure outside the capillary. The opposite process occurs when the blood leaves the capillaries and enters the venules, where the blood pressure drops due to an increase in flow rate. Arterioles receive autonomic nervous system innervation and respond to various circulating hormones in order to regulate their diameter. Retinal vessels lack a functional sympathetic innervation.

===Autoregulation===
Arteriole diameter varies according to autoregulation of organs or tissues to maintain sufficient blood flow despite changes in pressure via metabolic or myogenic factors which include stretch, carbon dioxide, and oxygen among other factors. Generally, norepinephrine and epinephrine (hormones produced by sympathetic nerves and the adrenal gland medulla) are vasoconstrictive acting on alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. However, the arterioles of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and pulmonary circulation vasodilate in response to these hormones when they act on beta-adrenergic receptors. Generally, stretch and high oxygen tension increase tone, and carbon dioxide and low pH promote vasodilation. Pulmonary arterioles are a noteworthy exception as they vasodilate in response to high oxygen. Brain arterioles are particularly sensitive to pH with reduced pH promoting vasodilation. A number of hormones influence arteriole tone such as angiotensin II (vasoconstrictive), endothelin (vasoconstrictive), bradykinin (vasodilation), atrial natriuretic peptide (vasodilation), and prostacyclin (vasodilation).

==Clinical significance==
Arteriole diameters decrease with age and with exposure to air pollution.
===Disease===

Any pathology which constricts blood flow, such as stenosis, will increase total peripheral resistance and lead to hypertension.

====Arteriosclerosis====

Arteriolosclerosis is the term specifically used for the hardening of arteriole walls. This can be due to decreased elastic production from fibrinogen, associated with ageing, or hypertension or pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis.

====Arteritis====
Arteritis of the arterioles occurs when the arteriole walls become inflamed as a result of either an immune response to infection or an autoimmune response.

===Medication===
The muscular contraction of arterioles is targeted by drugs that lower blood pressure (antihypertensives), for example the dihydropyridines (nifedipine and nicardipine), which block the calcium conductance in the muscular layer of the arterioles, causing relaxation.

This decreases the resistance to flow into peripheral vascular beds, lowering overall systemic pressure.

==Metarterioles==
A &quot;metarteriole&quot; is an arteriole which bypasses capillary circulation.

<doc id="479446" wikidata="Q7397921" url="?curid=479446" title="Sadie Hawkins Day">
<text>Sadie Hawkins Day is an American folk event and pseudo-holiday originated by Al Capp&#x27;s hillbilly comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1934–1977). The annual comic strip storyline inspired real-world Sadie Hawkins events, the premise of which is that women ask men for a date or dancing. &quot;Sadie Hawkins Day&quot; was introduced in the comic strip on November 15, 1937; the storyline ran until the beginning of December. The storyline was revisited the following October/November, and inspired a fad on college campuses. By 1939, &quot;Life&quot; reported that 201 colleges in 188 cities held a Sadie Hawkins Day event.

==Comic strip==
In &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, Sadie Hawkins was the daughter of Mayor Hekzebiah Hawkins, one of Dogpatch&#x27;s earliest settlers and the &quot;homeliest gal in all them hills&quot;. She grew frantic waiting for suitors until she reached age 35 and was still a spinster, and her father was worried about her living at home for the rest of her life. In desperation, he called together all the unmarried men of Dogpatch and declared it &quot;Sadie Hawkins Day&quot;. A foot race was decreed with Sadie pursuing the town&#x27;s eligible bachelors. If Sadie caught one of them, he would be forced to marry her. She was specifically interested in a handsome boy named Adam who was already in a courtship with Theresa, whose father was the area&#x27;s largest potato farmer. Unlike Sadie, Theresa had a number of courtship offers.

As the event became a tradition in the comic strip, Capp added more story elements. Each year, the Sadie Hawkins storyline begins with a prophecy by Old Man Mose, who gives Li&#x27;l Abner a cryptic clue about the end of the storyline, which always comes true in a roundabout, surprising way. The storyline sometimes also includes the Sadie Hawkins Eve Dance which is held on the previous evening, when the young women wear hobnailed boots and stomp on their partners&#x27; feet, to make the bachelors run slower during the event.

==Impact==
Inspired by Capp&#x27;s satiric race in which eligible women chase down terrified bachelors for the purposes of wedlock, the event reverses the cultural norms of men as the romantic pursuers. Arthur Berger says that the day &quot;represents a fertility rite and awakens an awareness of the relationship between the American courtship and more &#x27;primitive&#x27; rites.&quot;

==Date==
The date for Sadie Hawkins Day most commonly reported is November 13, two days before the first appearance in the comics. The date has on occasion been confused for February 29 (Leap Day), the date for Bachelor&#x27;s Day according to the original Irish tradition of women being allowed to propose marriage.

Al Capp finally set the date for Sadie Hawkins Day as November 26, in his last &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; daily strip on November 5, 1977.

<doc id="479450" wikidata="Q1372518" url="?curid=479450" title="Governor of Western Australia">
<text>The governor of Western Australia is the representative in Western Australia of the monarch, King Charles III. As with the other governors of the Australian states, the governor of Western Australia performs constitutional, ceremonial and community functions, including:

* presiding over the Executive Council;
* proroguing and dissolving the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council;
* issuing writs for elections; and
* appointing Ministers, Judges, Magistrates and Justices of the Peace.

Furthermore, all bills passed by the Parliament of Western Australia require the governor&#x27;s signature before they become acts and pass into law. However, since convention almost always requires the governor to act on the advice of the premier and the cabinet, such approval is almost always a formality.

Until the appointment of Sir James Mitchell in 1948, all governors of Western Australia had been British officials. After Mitchell&#x27;s appointment, a further three Britons served as governor: Mitchell&#x27;s two immediate successors, and then, from 1980 to 1983, Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Trowbridge who was the last non-Australian governor of any Australian state.

==Styles==
The governor of Western Australia is styled &quot;His Excellency&quot; during his term in office (or Her Excellency for a female governor). In August 2014, three of the four living past governors – John Sanderson, Ken Michael and Malcolm McCusker – were given the style &quot;The Honourable&quot;, on the recommendation of the premier. The other living former governor, Michael Jeffery, already held the style in virtue of his later service as governor-general of Australia.

==Governor&#x27;s standard==
The governor&#x27;s standard of Western Australia is the same design as the British blue ensign with the union flag at the upper left quarter. On the right side, the state badge of Western Australia, comprising a black swan in a yellow disc, is surmounted by the St. Edward&#x27;s crown.
If the standard is flying at Government House, on a vehicle or at an event, this indicates that the governor is present.


==List of governors and lieutenant-governors==

===List of governors===
===List of lieutenant-governors===
The lieutenant-governor serves as deputy to the governor, fulfilling the governor&#x27;s functions in the governor&#x27;s absence.

Stirling was only commissioned as the governor of Western Australia on 4 March 1831, rectifying the absence of a legal instrument providing the authority detailed in Stirling&#x27;s Instructions of 30 December 1828. Stirling had said of his own position: I believe I am the first Governor who ever formed a settlement without Commission, Laws, Instructions and Salary.

<doc id="479452" wikidata="Q808692" url="?curid=479452" title="Baron of Dunsany">
<text>The title Baron of Dunsany or, more commonly, Lord Dunsany, is one of the oldest (1439 or 1462) dignities in the Peerage of Ireland, one of just a handful of 13th- to 15th-century titles still extant, having had 21 holders, of the Plunkett name, to date. Other surviving medieval baronies include Kerry (1223, now a subsidiary title of the Marquess of Lansdowne), Kingsale (1344, feudally 1223), Trimlestown (1469), Baron Louth (second creation, 1541), and Dunboyne (1541, feudally 1324).

==History==
The first Baron of Dunsany was Sir Christopher Plunkett, second son of Christopher Plunkett, 1st Baron Killeen. The elder Christopher married Joan Cusack, heiress of Killeen and Dunsany, and passed Killeen to his eldest son and Dunsany to the second. The date at which Christopher Plunkett became a peer, and a hereditary member of the Irish Parliament, is uncertain; according to Cokayne&#x27;s &quot;Complete Peerage&quot;, there is no record of a Dunsany as a peer before 1489, and the creation may well have been as late as 1462, the year Sir Christopher died. On the other hand, Debrett&#x27;s listed the date of creation of the peerage as 1439, confirmed by Letters Patent in 1461.

The third Baron was a founder member of the military order known as the Brotherhood of Saint George and supported the claims of the pretender Lambert Simnel to the English Crown. The fourth Baron was a soldier of some repute who was killed trying to put down a rising in 1521. His son, the fifth Baron, was a soldier and statesman who was accused of complicity in the rebellion of Silken Thomas.

The eleventh Baron was a follower of King James II, who was outlawed after the Glorious Revolution. He was restored to his estates after the Treaty of Limerick, but neglected the necessary measures needed to have himself recognised as the holder of the peerage, and, as such, was not summoned to further Parliaments. The twelfth Baron conformed to the Church of Ireland to preserve the lands of both Dunsany and Killeen, but did not take the necessary steps to confirm his right to the title and to the seat in the Irish House of Lords it would bestow.

The thirteenth Baron, son of the twelfth, did go through the necessary procedures to have his title and claim to a seat in the former Irish upper house properly admitted, and thus sat in the House of Lords as a peer of proven right. He was succeeded by his son, the fourteenth Baron, who served as Lord Lieutenant of County Meath, and also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1836 to 1848.

The fifteenth Baron represented Drogheda in the House of Commons and was an Irish Representative Peer from 1850 to 1852. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixteenth Baron. The latter was an admiral in the Royal Navy, and also served as an Irish Representative Peer between 1864 and 1889. The seventeenth Baron, son of the sixteenth, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire South and was an Irish Representative Peer from 1893 to 1899. His brother, Horace Plunkett was a key figure in the development of Irish agriculture and the Irish cooperative movement.

The seventeenth Baron was succeeded by his son, the eighteenth Baron. He was a well-known poet, playwright and author of short stories and novels, best known now for his short stories in the field of fantasy, the Jorkens stories, and his novel &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The descendants of his younger brother, Reginald Drax, bear not only the Dunsany&#x27;s surname Plunkett, but also other surnames inherited from their mother, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Ernle-Erle-Drax, née Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (1855–1916), giving them a rare quadruple-barrelled surname of Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax.

The nineteenth Baron was a career soldier, primarily in the British Indian Army, while the twentieth, the painter and sculptor Edward Plunkett, 20th Baron of Dunsany, was the first Roman Catholic holder of the title since the 12th Baron. , the title is held by the eighteenth Baron&#x27;s great-grandson, Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, who in 2011, succeeded his father; as of 2022, he has one daughter.

==Seat==
The ancestral seat of this branch of the Plunkett family is Dunsany Castle in County Meath in Ireland.

==Style==
The title is listed in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage and Baronetage&quot; and &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Peerage and Baronetage&quot; as Baron &quot;of&quot; Dunsany, but in &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; as Baron Dunsany without the &quot;of&quot;. In either case, the holder of the title is called &quot;Lord Dunsany&quot; in all but the most formal contexts.

<text>Harry Stephen Bartlett (born September 19, 1947) is an American politician and former president and CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, an advocacy group lobbying the U.S. federal government on financial services legislation, a position which he held from 1999 to 2012. He served as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, as the 55th mayor of Dallas, Texas, and as a member of the Dallas City Council.

==Political offices==

Bartlett served as a U.S. Representative from 1983 until his resignation in 1991. He won the open seat over former state Representative Kay Bailey Hutchison, later the state treasurer, U.S. Senator, and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 2010. The position became vacant when the long-term Republican incumbent, James M. Collins ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against the Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., of Houston.

While in Congress, Bartlett served as a member of the House Banking Committee, where he &quot;led the successful push to let the market set interest rates on government-insured mortgages.&quot; He served as Deputy Whip and was a sponsor or principal cosponsor of nearly 20 major pieces of legislation, including the Enhanced Secondary Mortgage Market Act, Fair Labor Standards Act Reforms, FHA Deregulation and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Bartlett left the House to run for mayor of Dallas. On November 5, 1991, he was elected to the nonpartisan position with 54 percent of the vote. He was sworn in on December 2, 1991. As mayor, Bartlett led an effort to reduce violent crime and adopted a $5 billion capital improvements plan. He worked to improve an economic revitalization, a downtown renaissance, and 30,000 new residential units in or adjacent to downtown Dallas. Bartlett served as the city&#x27;s executive until 1995.

==Private sector and lobbying==
Bartlett was hired to head the Financial Services Roundtable in 1999. In 2012, he was replaced as president and CEO by former Republican presidential candidate and the former Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.

Following his government service, Bartlett served on a number of boards of directors, including IMCO Recycling, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation, Sun Coast Industrial and the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington. He is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of RespectAbility. In addition, he also served on the board of governors of the National YMCA, the Fannie Mae National Advisory Council and the board of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. In 2001 he served on the President&#x27;s Commission on Excellence in Special Education.

Bartlett has been recognized for his leadership skills by the National Association of Manufacturers, National Federation of Independent Business; &quot;Ebony&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, and &quot;Jet&quot; magazines; Texas Association for Retarded Citizens; Anti-Defamation League; National Council of La Raza; American Electronics Association; Watchdogs of the Treasury; and Best Dad by the NF Foundation.

In 2011, Bartlett earned about $2 million a year at Financial Services Roundtable.

==Other activities==
Bartlett has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and as a member of the Leadership Group on U.S.-Muslim Engagement.

==2020 Presidential Election==
On August 24, 2020, Bartlett was one of 24 former Republican lawmakers to endorse Democratic nominee Joe Biden on the opening day of the Republican National Convention.

==Personal life==
Bartlett was born in Los Angeles, California and reared in Lockhart in Caldwell County, Texas. He attended Kimball High School in Dallas, at which he met his future wife at a Young Republicans bake sale; he graduated in 1966. Barlett attended the University of Texas at Austin, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He also became a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Bartlett is married to the former Gail Coke; the Bartletts have three children and six grandchildren. They reside in McLean, Virginia.

<text>Eraser is a 1996 American action film directed by Chuck Russell and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Vanessa Williams, James Caan, James Coburn, and Robert Pastorelli. The film tells the story of a U.S. Marshal of WITSEC who protects a senior operative testifying about an illegal arms deal and is forced to fight his former allies when one of the players is revealed to be a mole inside WITSEC.

&quot;Eraser&quot; premiered in Hollywood on June 11, 1996, and was released in the rest of the United States on June 21, 1996, by Warner Bros. It received mixed reviews from critics, although they praised Williams&#x27;s and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performances, the action sequences and the visual effects. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing in 1997, but lost to &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;. It was also one of the first major films released on DVD, being part of the Japanese launch lineup of Warner Home Video&#x27;s debut of the format on December 20, 1996.

A direct-to-video reboot of the film titled &quot;&quot; starring Dominic Sherwood, was released on June 7, 2022.

==Plot==
John Kruger, a U.S. Marshal who specializes in &quot;erasing&quot; witnesses, is given a new assignment by his superior, Arthur Beller: Lee Cullen has alerted the FBI that Cyrez executives have financed the creation of an electromagnetic rifle, which they intend to sell on the black market.

Lee downloads data from the weapon&#x27;s development onto two discs. Cyrez Vice President William Donohue detects Lee&#x27;s intrusion and summons her for a meeting. After discovering her alliance with the FBI, Donohue commits suicide. Lee delivers the disc but refuses Kruger&#x27;s offer to go into protection. The FBI&#x27;s disc is replaced with a fake on the orders of Under Secretary of Defense Daniel Harper.

Lee is attacked by mercenaries sent by Cyrez CEO Eugene Morehart but is rescued by Kruger, who learns that several witnesses he had helped are being murdered due to someone in WITSEC leaking information. The agency is now transferring all witnesses to other locations. Kruger helps his mentor Robert DeGuerin raid a cabin and rescue a witness from a team of assassins. DeGuerin murders the witness when she overhears one of her captors reveal that he is the mole.

DeGuerin drugs Kruger, who manages to warn Lee before losing consciousness. The call is traced to New York City and DeGuerin kills his innocent deputy Monroe with Kruger&#x27;s gun. When Kruger awakens, DeGuerin explains that they are the go-betweens for a buyer who plans to purchase the rifle and tries to recruit him. Kruger fends them off and escapes from the plane to rescue Lee from the same mercenaries who tried to kill her before. Kruger and Lee flee through New York City Zoo.

DeGuerin has Kruger and Lee branded as fugitives. The pair infiltrate Cyrez with the aid of Johnny Casteleone, a witness Kruger recently erased, and use Donohue&#x27;s terminal to decrypt Lee&#x27;s second disc. The disc reveals that a shipment of rifles has been stashed at the docks in Baltimore. The buyer is crime boss Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky, who plans to resell the weapons to terrorists. The company detects the intrusion and erases the disc; DeGuerin and his men capture Lee, but Kruger escapes.

Casteleone contacts his cousin, who controls the docks. They kill Petrofsky and Schiff. DeGuerin tries to shoot Lee, but Kruger comes to her aid and destroys the system on the crane. He then secures DeGuerin, proving his and Lee&#x27;s innocence. DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart are indicted for treason, but when it becomes clear that they will likely be acquitted in court, Kruger fakes his and Lee&#x27;s deaths in an explosion.

DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart leave in a limo that suddenly stops at a railroad crossing. The driver, revealed to be Casteleone, locks the doors and exits the vehicle. Kruger calls DeGuerin with his iconic words, &quot;You&#x27;ve just been erased!&quot; at which point a freight train plows into the limo, killing all three men in it. Kruger returns to Lee, who asks what happened, to which he responds, &quot;They caught a train.&quot; They then drive off to start a new life.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development and casting===
Director Chuck Russell and star Arnold Schwarzenegger were originally working on another project together when &quot;Eraser&quot; was brought to their attention. Russell was excited about the possibilities the film could bring between actor and the character: &quot;I see Arnold the way a lot of people do – as a mythic, bigger-than-life character – and that&#x27;s who Kruger is. The character and the scenario are based firmly in reality, but I liked the mythic proportions of this man with a strong sense of duty, a strong sense of honor, who will literally do anything to protect a noble witness. I was excited about doing a film that had heroic proportions.&quot; Producer Arnold Kopelson was also keen to cast Schwarzenegger in the role of &quot;The Eraser&quot;, having talked with the actor about working on projects before. Vanessa Williams would be cast as the lead female character, Lee Cullen, the key witness Eraser must protect. Williams came to the attention of the Kopelsons when Maria Shriver, wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger at the time, suggested her for the role. To play the character of DeGuerin (Kruger&#x27;s mentor and the main sociopathic antagonist), the filmmakers wanted an actor who could &quot;convey intelligence, skill and magnetism – a more mature version of the Kruger character&quot;, and they cast James Caan in this role. Before Caan was officially cast, Jonathan Pryce was also considered for the role. The screenplay was initially the work of Tony Puryear, who had a background in advertising and rap videos. Writers Walon Green and Michael S. Chernuchin had previously worked together on the television drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Extensive, uncredited rewrites were made by Frank Darabont and William Wisher Jr. (&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;). Additional rewrites were made by John Milius as a favor to Schwarzenegger. John Pogue also did rewrites on the script, however most of his ideas weren&#x27;t used.

===Design===
The &quot;rail-gun&quot; featured in the film as a key plot device, and Schwarzenegger talks on the subject: &quot;We paid a lot of attention to making the audience feel the danger of this weapon, that anyone can be outside of your house, looking right through the walls. It really leaves you nowhere to hide,&quot; he explains. &quot;But, on top of that, we show the sophistication of the weapon in a lot of fun ways: you not only see through a building, you see a person&#x27;s skeleton and even their heart beating inside. There are some great visual effects there.&quot;

===Filming===
&quot;Eraser&quot; began principal photography in 1995 in New York City. Locations would include The Harlem Rail Yard in the South Bronx, Central Park&#x27;s Sheep Meadow and Chinatown. Following shooting in New York production moved to Washington, D.C. For the action sequence which takes place in the Reptile House of New York City Zoo, interiors were built on the soundstages of the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The screenplay went through numerous drafts by some of the most prominent screenwriters in the business, with a great deal of uncredited script-doctoring work being done by Graham Yost and William Wisher.

One of the most demanding action sequences in the film featured the character of Kruger forced to flee from a jet speeding through the skies at per hour. Speaking about this scene, director Russell says: &quot;These things are jigsaw puzzle pieces not only within shooting sequence but within each shot. You had elements that were live action, elements that were miniature, sometimes computer-generated, and they&#x27;re all married together in the final processing.&quot; Some of the physical stunts were performed by Schwarzenegger himself. For the &quot;aerial&quot; stunt Arnold was required to fall in vertical descent and perform a back flip in mid-flight. The shot took seven takes to get right. In the final film, Kruger appears to drop along the length of the fuselage and past the flaming engine of the jet thanks to inventive camera angles and special effects.

===Post-production===
The original name of the Cyrez corporations was &quot;Cyrex&quot;. However, Cyrix, a microprocessor corporation and rival of Intel, protested. The name was then changed digitally in any scenes where the name appeared in a fairly costly process for the time, and dialogue redubbed. Some instances of the &quot;Cyrex&quot; logo are still visible in the finished film.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Eraser&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 29, 1996. The DVD was then released in 1997.

The North American LaserDisc release of the film is notorious for being poorly manufactured, with a large number of copies exhibiting severe laser rot.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Eraser&quot; had an opening weekend of $24.5 million in the United States during the summer season of 1996, staying ahead of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. The final US gross was $101.2 million and final worldwide gross was $242.3 million. &quot;Eraser&quot; was a commercial success in the Philippines, grossing more at the local box office than &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Rock&quot;. The film also had the largest opening for a Warner Bros. film in Malaysia, holding that record for six years until 2002 when it was given to &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.

===Critical response===
Based on 56 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 43% and an average score of 5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Eraser&quot;″s shoot-&#x27;em-up action might show off some cutting edge weaponry, but its rote story is embarrassingly obsolete&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 56 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

A more positive review came from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote that there were so many plot holes that &quot;it helps to have a short attention span&quot;, but that &quot;Eraser&quot; is nonetheless &quot;actually good action fun, with spectacular stunts and special effects&quot; and a spirited performance from Williams &quot;running and jumping and fighting and shooting and kicking and screaming and being tied to chairs and smuggling computer discs and looking great.&quot;

==Other media==
===Novelization===
A novelization based on the film by Robert Tine titled &quot;Eraser&quot;, was released in 1996.

===Video game===
The PC video game &quot;Eraser - Turnabout&quot; was released as a follow-up to the plot of the film.

==Reboot==

In September 2021, a sequel, which became a reboot of &quot;Eraser&quot; instead, was announced to be in development with Dominic Sherwood in the lead role. The film co-stars Jacky Lai, and the supporting cast includes McKinley Belcher III and Eddie Ramos. It was filmed secretly in mid-2021, for release through Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The film was released theatrically in Germany on March 31, 2022, and on Digital, Blu-ray &amp; DVD in United States on June 7, 2022. It became available for streaming on HBO Max in fall 2022.

<doc id="479464" wikidata="Q6540092" url="?curid=479464" title="Lianne Dalziel">
<text>Lianne Audrey Dalziel (; born 7 June 1960) is a New Zealand politician and former Mayor of Christchurch. Prior to this position, she was a member of the New Zealand Parliament for 23 years, serving as Minister of Immigration, Commerce, Minister of Food Safety and Associate Minister of Justice in the Fifth Labour Government. She resigned from Cabinet on 20 February 2004 after apparently lying about a leak of documents to the media, but was reinstated as a Minister following Labour&#x27;s return to office after the 2005 election. She resigned from Parliament effective 11 October 2013 to contest the Christchurch mayoral election. The incumbent, Bob Parker, decided not to stand again. She was widely regarded as the top favourite and won with a wide margin to become the 46th Mayor of Christchurch.

== Early life ==
Dalziel was born in 1960, raised in Christchurch and attended Canterbury University. She graduated with a law degree and was admitted to the Bar in 1984. She served as the legal officer for the Canterbury Hotel and Hospital Workers&#x27; Union, and later became the union&#x27;s Secretary. She also participated in national groups such as the Federation of Labour and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions.

== Member of Parliament ==




Dalziel entered Parliament as a Labour Party MP for Christchurch Central in 1990, replacing outgoing former Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer. She held this seat until the 1996 election (being replaced by Tim Barnett), when she became a list MP under the new MMP electoral system. In the 1999 election, she chose to contest an electorate again, and won the Christchurch East seat. She held the seat in the 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011 elections. In 2011 she opted not to go on the Labour list.

In November 1990 she was appointed as Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for the Audit Department and Customs by Labour leader Mike Moore. After Helen Clark replaced Moore as leader in December 1993 Dalziel was promoted and given the Health portfolio. &quot;Time&quot; magazine picked her as a future leader in its December 1994 edition.

In August 1997 Dalziel was replaced in the Health portfolio by Annette King due to perceived ineffectiveness against Minister of Health Bill English, media believing Alliance Health spokesperson Phillida Bunkle was performing better. Instead she was made Shadow Attorney-General and given the portfolios of immigration, youth affairs and statistics. Dalziel expressed enthusiasm for the chance to utilise her law degree in politics as Shadow Attorney-General.

=== Cabinet minister ===
In the new government formed by Labour, Dalziel became Minister of Immigration, Minister for Senior Citizens, and Minister for Disability Issues. When Labour won re-election in the 2002 election, Dalziel also became Minister of Commerce (while ceasing to be Minister for Disability Issues). In 2003, she ceased to be Minister for Senior Citizens. As Minister of Immigration, Dalziel was often in the spotlight. In particular, she often clashed with Winston Peters, leader of the anti-immigration New Zealand First party.

After the 2005 election, Dalziel was re-elected by her caucus colleagues to Cabinet and was given the portfolios of Commerce, Small Business, and Women&#x27;s Affairs.

Mike Williams, President of the Labour Party from 2000 to 2009, states that he was surprised by Clark appointing Dalziel Minister of Commerce and thought of it as an &quot;odd choice&quot;. But she worked herself into the portfolio, paid attention to detail, and within a year had &quot;proved herself&quot;. Williams believes this is due to her high intelligence and her ability to listen. Tim Barnett, MP for Christchurch Central from 1996 to 2008 credits her training as a lawyer and &quot;having a bigger brain than most of us&quot; for her success. Williams states that as Minister of Commerce, Dalziel worked closely with National&#x27;s Simon Power and built &quot;cross-party unity on various issues&quot;.

=== Controversies ===
Dalziel&#x27;s position became difficult after she was accused of giving certain documents to the press to bolster the case for a decision her Associate Minister had made. The decision, concerning the deportation of a Sri Lankan teenager who was seeking asylum but who had originally lied about the reasons, was controversial, and Dalziel leaked the notes of the teenager&#x27;s lawyer to TV3, attempting to discredit the teenager&#x27;s case for asylum. Dalziel tried to avoid admitting to being the source of the documents, but was forced to admit that the leak had been at her direction. There was also significant controversy about how Dalziel had obtained the documents in the first place. Dalziel offered her resignation which Prime Minister Helen Clark accepted.

=== Opposition and mayoral ambitions===
After Labour was defeated in the 2008 general election, Dalziel became the Opposition spokesperson on Justice and Commerce and, from 2011, the spokesperson for the Christchurch Earthquake Recovery, Civil Defence &amp; Emergence Management, Consumer Rights &amp; Standards, and associate spokesperson for Justice.

Rumours of Dalziel standing as Mayor of Christchurch go back to at least 2009. Since the February 2011 earthquake, the rumours that Dalziel would contest the 2013 Christchurch mayoralty became more consistent. In May 2012, Dalziel tried to put an end to these rumours by announcing: &quot;The job I really want is Gerry Brownlee&#x27;s, rather than Bob Parker&#x27;s.&quot; Brownlee is Earthquake Recovery Minister, and Parker was the Mayor of Christchurch at the time. In the February 2013 reshuffle of opposition portfolios, Dalziel dropped out of the top 20 (only the first 20 positions are ranked by the Labour Party). An editorial in &quot;The Press&quot; presumed that her strong support for David Cunliffe was part of the reason for her demotion. The editorial also speculated that she might reconsider her political future:

The demotion is bound to concentrate Dalziel&#x27;s mind on whether she should run for the Christchurch mayoralty. As things stand, a place for her in a Labour cabinet as minister for the earthquake recovery looks unlikely, but she would be a strong candidate for mayor.

Following months of speculation, &quot;The Press&quot; reported on 20 April 2013 that Lianne Dalziel would challenge Parker for the mayoralty, and that she had asked 24-year-old Student Volunteer Army organiser Sam Johnson to be her running mate, with a view of Johnson becoming deputy mayor. The newspaper expressed surprise by this pairing, given that Dalziel was a Labour Party member, and Johnson a member of the Young Nats, the youth arm of the National Party. Saying that: &quot;It was a really difficult decision to make, but I don&#x27;t think it is the right thing for me right now&quot;, Johnson eventually decided against running. On 19 June, Dalziel formally confirmed that she would contest the mayoralty, also announcing that she would resign from Parliament, which would trigger a by-election in the Christchurch East electorate. Dalziel delivered her resignation letter on 17 September and delivered her valedictory speech the following day with her resignation taking effect on Friday, 11 October; the day before the local body election so that the by-election campaign did not interfere with the local body election. In a later interview, Dalziel confirmed that she would have left Parliament even if Shearer had put her onto the front bench.

Although some expressed concerns about Dalziel&#x27;s Labour Party background, including central city property developer Antony Gough, who talked of her &quot;red apron strings&quot; getting in the way of working with local business owners, she also nevertheless open support from the political right for her mayoral ambitions: Christchurch City Councillor Tim Carter, son of Christchurch property developer Philip Carter and nephew of Speaker David Carter, encouraged her to stand for the mayoralty; former National Party cabinet minister Philip Burdon was one of her nominees when she lodged her nomination for the mayoralty with the returning officer; and blogger Cameron Slater, by many considered a &quot;conduit for factions of the National Party&quot; wrote:

Christchurch needs a uniter, not a divider, and the word is that National would far rather deal with Lianne and the competent councillors she is bringing with her than Bob Parker.

Dalziel&#x27;s Earthquake Recovery portfolio in Labour&#x27;s shadow cabinet was split and given to Ruth Dyson and Clayton Cosgrove.

==Mayor of Christchurch==

Dalziel was elected Mayor of Christchurch in the October 2013 mayoral election, with a margin of almost 50,000 votes over the next candidate, businessman Paul Lonsdale. She was sworn in on 24 October, with a past mayor, Vicki Buck as her deputy. At the 2019 local election, she won the mayoralty for a third time.

In late February 2020, the New Zealand Police referred Dalziel&#x27;s election expenses during the 2019 Christchurch mayoral election to the Serious Fraud Office. Two complainants, including rival mayoral candidate John Minto, had filed a complaint regarding donations by six people that exceeded the $1,500 limit under the Local Electoral Act. On 17 December, the Serious Fraud Office cleared Mayor Dalziel, stating that it found no evidence of criminal conduct relating to donations made to the Mayor by several Chinese businessmen during the 2019 mayoral election.

On 1 July 2021, she announced she would not seek re-election as mayor at the local body elections in 2022.

In October 2021, Dalziel expressed opposition to the Sixth Labour Government&#x27;s Three Waters reform programme, criticising the Government for &quot;mandating councils.&quot;

==Honours==

In the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday and Coronation Honours, Dalziel was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local government and as a Member of Parliament.

==Personal life==
Dalziel married Mike Pannell in 1988. The pair divorced in 1995 and indicated that the stress of parliamentary life was a major factor in the decision to separate. In 2000, Dalziel married Christchurch lawyer Rob Davidson. He died of prostate cancer in August 2020, aged 69 years.

<text>Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends is a 1978 biography of Groucho Marx by Charlotte Chandler. The biography was written towards the end of Groucho&#x27;s life (and published after his death), and chronicles many interviews between Chandler and Groucho. When asked for an interview, Groucho declined, however he invited Charlotte to his house so he could tell her no in person. After several hours of conversation Groucho asked &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you writing?&quot; Anecdotes and stories of Groucho&#x27;s life and career as a star of stage and screen are hilariously told by his contemporaries and lifelong friends. Stories from Groucho&#x27;s life from the beginning of the 20th century conjure up a picture of great poverty and great wealth and give the reader an insight to the phenomenon that was the Marx Brothers and an understanding of their individual relationships with colleagues and friends, and with one another. In addition to the &quot;old timers&quot; there are interviews and comment from Woody Allen, Bill Cosby and Jack Nicholson to name but a few. The 1992 paperback edition features an introduction by Cosby.

<doc id="479468" wikidata="Q318879" url="?curid=479468" title="Gaius Flaminius (consul 223 BC)">
<text>Gaius Flaminius (c. 275 BC217 BC) was a leading Roman politician in the third century BC. Flaminius served as consul twice, in 223 and 217. He is notable for the &quot;Lex Flaminia&quot;, a land reform passed in 232, the construction of the Circus Flaminius in 221, the construction of the Via Flaminia, and his death at the hands of Hannibal&#x27;s army at the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217, during the Second Punic War. Flaminius is celebrated by ancient sources as being a skilled orator and a man possessed of great piety, strength, and determination. He is, however, simultaneously criticised by ancient writers such as Cicero and Livy for his popular policies and disregard of Roman traditions, particularly during the terms of his tribunate and second consulship.

== Tribunate and the &quot;Lex Flaminia&quot;, 232 BC ==
Flaminius was elected as tribune of the plebs in 232 BC. Cicero writes that Flaminius was an accomplished orator before the people, a skill that likely helped him achieve the tribunate. During his term, Flaminius proposed the &quot;Lex Flaminia de Agro Gallico et Piceno viritim dividundo&quot;, a controversial agrarian law proposing the settlement of Roman citizens in the Ager Gallicus Picenus lands around Picenum and Ariminum, made available by Rome&#x27;s defeat of their previous occupants, the Senones, in 283. It is unclear from the ancient sources why the Ager Gallicus Picenus was chosen for the project.

Polybius suggests that the law caused problems with the Boii as the Romans began settling near their territory, eventually leading to the Gallic rebellion in 225. Approximately 2,580 square kilometres had been made &quot;ager publicus&quot; following the Roman victory, although not all the available territory was distributed under this law. Some was in fact privatised prior to Flaminius&#x27; reform. The land was reasonably valuable as it could produce large quantities of wine. It is not clear from the ancient sources how many people were settled there, although estimates suggest approximately 19,000 citizens, not including their families. It would have been problematic to transport and settle this many people to a relatively distant area from Rome so scholars have argued that transportation must have been made by sea, as it would have been difficult to do so by land. This transportation has been linked to the Roman conflict with Illyrian pirates as raids now directly affected Roman citizens.

Ancient sources describe resistance from the senate to these measures including opposition from Quintus Fabius Maximus, a rival of Flaminius, although Cicero notes that Spurius Carvilius, Fabius Maximus&#x27; colleague for his second consulship, did not join the opposition. Valerius Maximus writes that Flaminius persisted in pushing it through despite threats and pleas from the senate, and against the possibility of an army being levied against him if he continued. Later Roman historians use the opposition to the law from the senate to portray Flaminius as a &quot;populares&quot; style leader, alienated from the senate in the tradition of the Gracchi, although this narrative is challenged by modern historians.

=== Controversy in passing the &quot;Lex Flaminia&quot; ===
One tradition suggests that as Flaminius was proposing his agrarian law he was dragged from the rostra by his father. Cicero writes that Flaminius&#x27; father was subsequently tried for &quot;maiestas&quot; (diminishing the majesty of the Roman people) for this action, but argued that he was exerting his authority as a father over a son rather than a citizen acting against an elected tribune of the plebs. Valerius Maximus follows this tradition, listing Flaminius as an example of male piety for respecting his father&#x27;s private authority over him as he allowed his father to remove him from the rostra when nothing else would sway him. Valerius Maximus claims the crowd respected Flaminius&#x27; &quot;pietas&quot; in this event and does not mention the subsequent &quot;maiestas&quot; trial described by Cicero. This has led some modern scholars to argue that the law was never passed, although contemporary sources indicate that it did.

=== Scholarly explanations for senatorial opposition to the &quot;Lex Flaminia&quot; ===
Early scholarly thinking compared Flaminius with Tiberius Gracchus as they both pushed through land laws against the wishes of the senate. This led to the view that the senatorial opposition stemmed from an economic motivation to keep this land solely for the &quot;nobiles&quot; who had been exploiting it since its capture, and the portrayal of Flaminius as a democratic leader campaigning for the common people against the greedy &quot;nobiles&quot;. Fraccaro rejected this explanation and began looking for a political motivation instead, arguing that there was senatorial opposition as the law proposed a new style of settlement. Previously colonists kept their Roman citizenship if the land was connected to the &quot;ager Romanus&quot;, as otherwise Rome founded a Latin colony and colonists lost Roman citizenship, while through this law colonists kept their citizenship despite the distance from Rome. Meyer argues against this, citing citizenship given to other peoples including the Sabines and Picentes despite their distance from Rome.

Corbett proposes instead that Rome had a manpower problem, and the senate was therefore unwilling to distribute citizens so far away to a place already sufficiently guarded. Feig Vishnia argues against this idea as the people settled had lost land and therefore were ineligible for the army, and so by giving them land Rome would increase its manpower possibilities and protect the border with the Boii, an idea supported by the fact that the area became a key source of manpower in the Second Punic War.

Develin claims that the law never passed due to the intervention of Flaminius&#x27; father, and that the senate settled Latin colonies there to prevent complaints from the potential settlers, but no names of these colonies are found in the ancient evidence and his argument is not supported by the ancient evidence on the law. He also argues that it impossible to reconstruct factional support within the senate for the law.

Kramer however suggests that Flaminius was manipulating factional rivalries by aligning with the Aemilii to gain an advantage for the plebs he hoped to settle. He views choice of territory as part of an aggressive policy against Gallic threat advocated by the Aemilii who saw the Gauls as potential allies for Hannibal, and opposed by the Fabii.

Cassola argues that the law was opposed for multiple reasons, first because both senators and publicans would lose economically if land was distributed and also because there was conflict in the senate between a liberal faction supporting southern expansion, facilitating economic and cultural relations with Greek territories, and a conservative faction in favour of maintaining the agrarian nature of Rome. He sees Flaminius as champion of the rural plebs against the urban plebs, opposed to expansion beyond Italy. Yavetz similarly asserts that Flaminius is a man with his own faction, opposed to the senatorial aristocracy, and in 232 he may have been supported by the Aemilii-Scipiones on political grounds.

Scholars have argued that opposition from the senate was due to the possibility of war with the Gauls since a settlement near Gallic territory may have seemed aggressive. This is what Polybius argues caused war with the Gauls seven years later. Roselaar also suggests that the Senones had not been completely eradicated and still occupied the land. Rome was already at war in several places and the senate may not have wanted to provoke another immediate conflict. Feig Vishnia also argues that this explains the conflict between Fabius and Flaminius as Fabius was cautious and did not want to give the Gauls an excuse for more conflict.

Roselaar argued that the senate was afraid that Flaminius would gain too much influence over the people for distributing the land to them, although Feig Vishnia points out that they were too far away to easily vote and settlers were only incorporated into two tribes which limited their political usefulness.

=== Support for the &quot;Lex Flaminia&quot; ===
Feig Vishnia argues that since the law was passed it must have had more support than indicated by the sources as no tribunician veto was used against it. The law was passed in the consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and he may have been a supporter as Flaminius had connections with the Aemilii. Spurius Carvilius Ruga&#x27;s silence, mentioned by Cicero, is also significant in showing support among the senate for the law. L. Caecilius Metellus may have been another supporter as his eulogy describes him taking part in a commission appointed for land distribution and the only possible distribution in this period was Flaminius&#x27;. Flaminius&#x27; law may not have been as controversial as represented in later sources, as he was able to go on to hold the highest offices of the state and giving land to soldier veterans was simply a continuation of normal Roman policy.

=== Dating issues ===
There have been issues with the dating of his tribunate as Polybius places it in 232 in the consulship of Lepidus, while Cicero dates it to the second consulship of Fabius Maximus. Scholars have argued that Cicero&#x27;s date is incorrect and instead that the opening months of Flaminius&#x27; tribunate would have overlapped with Fabius Maximus&#x27;s first consulship allowing Fabius to officially oppose the law. Despite chronological problems with Cicero, Fieg Vishnia argues that Spurius Carvilius Ruga&#x27;s silence, even while not the consul, is significant in showing support among the senate for the law.

== Praetorship, 227 BC ==
Flaminius was elected praetor for the year 227 BC. It was the first year in which four praetors were elected as Rome had gained overseas provinces, meaning Flaminius was made the first praetor of Sicily. Through his position in Sicily he was tasked with ruling over the Sicilians as praetors held &quot;imperium&quot;, which gave him the power to command an army and to quell any rebellions against Rome&#x27;s administration in Sicily. He was also the magistrate who dealt with all judicial matters that arose in Sicily and regularly exchanged messages with the senate in Rome to resolve judicial matters. Flaminius&#x27; tenure in Sicily must have been viewed well by the provincials, since in 196 BC they sent his son one million measures of grain to bring back to Rome at two asses per measure during the latter&#x27;s tenure as aedile as a sign of respect to his father. As a result of the influx of grain, Rome celebrated the &quot;Ludi Romani&quot; magnificently, repeated for two days to celebrate the ability of Flaminius to govern a foreign city state.

== First consulship, 223 BC ==
Flaminius as a novus homo secured election to the consulship in 223 BC alongside Publius Furius Philus, due to his popularity among the plebs. His term was plagued by unfavourable auspices from the outset. Plutarch records that at the time of the consular election, priests had proclaimed inauspicious and baleful omens from the flight of birds. During Flaminius&#x27; journey to Cisalpine Gaul, the river flowing through Picenum was running red with blood, and three moons were seen at Ariminum. Upon these grounds the senate sent letters commanding both consuls to return to the city with great speed, lay down their office, and forbade them from engaging the enemy. Before the senate&#x27;s message arrived, Flaminius entered Gallic territory through the country of the Anares, and admitted the tribe into his friendship. Even after the letters arrived, driven by his fiery and ambitious nature, Flaminius refused to read the senate&#x27;s directive until after he had joined battle with the Insubrians, whom he soundly defeated.

Polybius attributes Flaminius&#x27; victory not to the consul, but to his military tribunes, who from former battles had learnt the swords used by the Gauls after an initial onslaught became so bent they were unserviceable, unless the men had time to straighten them on the ground with their boots. Recognising this, the tribunes distributed spears among the front line with orders to allow the Gauls to slash at their spears, rendering their swords useless. The Romans then switched to swords, and slew the greater part of their enemies. Flaminius is judged by Polybius to have mismanaged the battle by deploying his force at the edge of the riverbank, not allowing for any tactical room to fall back upon, for if the troops were pushed back even by the slightest degree, they would have been forced into the river. Despite this apparent tactical oversight by Flaminius, the Romans were able to return to Rome with a large amount of booty and trophies due to their own skill and valour.

While Polybius details how Flaminius won an important victory for Rome, the majority of the sources focus upon the portent auspices which surrounded his consulship and his disobedience of the senate which led to both the abdication of his consulship and the attempted refusal of his triumph. While evidence steadfastly confirms Flaminius&#x27; triumph occurred, inconsistencies among sources point to some form of historical inaccuracy and fabrication. Plutarch details that upon Flaminius&#x27; return, the people would not go out to see him and due to his insolence and disobedience came close to denying him his triumph, compelled him to renounce his consulship, and made him a private citizen. While Livy labels his behaviour as insubordination towards both men and the gods, Silius Italicus describes Flaminius&#x27; actions as resulting in an easy triumph and crushing a fickle and guileless people. While the latter was most certainly true, Plutarch&#x27;s version of events conflicts with Italicus&#x27;. Furthermore, Heinemann within his translation of Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; cites that Flaminius triumphed in the face of senatorial opposition by virtue of a decree of the people, which again further diverges with Plutarch&#x27;s account where the people were the main barrier to the triumph. Other modern scholars such as Develin support Heinemann&#x27;s view, which points towards an inaccuracy or fabrication on the part of Plutarch.

== Magister Equitum, 222 BC ==
Flaminius served as magister equitum in 222 BC, having been appointed to serve under the dictator Marcus Minucius Rufus. The magister equitum served as the deputy of a Roman dictator, being appointed by the dictator to assist him with his political and military functions. As such, the magister equitum&#x27;s magistracy ended with the dictator&#x27;s. While Plutarch and Valerius Maximus both recount how Flaminius&#x27; tenure as Master of the Horse ended as a result of poor omens—namely that a shrew-mouse was heard at an inopportune time—sources differ as to the course of events following said omens. While Plutarch claims &quot;the people deposed these officials&quot; (Flaminius and Mucinius), Valerius Maximums claims that the two abdicated their posts.

== Censorship and building program, 220 BC ==

Flaminius was elected as censor in 220, alongside his colleague Lucius Aemilius Papus. Livy provides an account of his achievements in this office. Flaminius registered and organised the freedmen of Rome into the four existing city tribes (Esquilina, Palatina, Subura and Collina). He also established the Roman colonies of Placentia and Cremona, situated at two points on opposite sides of the Padus. As censor, Flaminius also commissioned the construction of the Circus Flaminius and the Via Flaminia.

=== Circus Flaminius ===

The Circus Flaminius was located at the southern end of the Campus Martius. Taylor writes that Flaminius was taking advantage of the existing association between the &quot;Prata Flaminia&quot; and the plebs, pointing out the advantage of having such an area outside the pomerium. It was circular in shape, with Varro suggesting that the shape was designed to accommodate the horse racing in the Taurian Games. It is likely that the &quot;Ludi Taurii&quot; were the only games that were held in the circus, with the majority of public spectacles held in the Circus Maximus. However, this didn&#x27;t limit its usefulness as it was also used to host public assemblies. Over time, the area around the Circus Flaminius became extremely decadent, with Pompey, Caesar, and particularly Augustus building extravagant temples and public works there. Humphrey writes that &quot;by the early third century AD, the open space had been reduced to a piazza in the front the great Augustan colonnades of Octavia and Philippus&quot;. By this date, Humphrey estimates that the piazza was less than 300 meters long.

=== Via Flaminia ===
The Via Flaminia was a road constructed by Flaminius during his censorship in 220 BC. The road travelled from the coast of Ariminum to Rome at the Porta del popolo via the Apennine Mountains. It was able to link the regions of Etruria, Latium and Marche (Ager Gallicus), thus facilitating greater connection and ease of communication between them and Rome. It also allowed for Rome to better mobilise their army to fight off invaders such as Hannibal in 219, and encouraged trade with the aforementioned regions as it allowed for quicker movement of goods like olives and wine. It also effected the political system in Rome positively as it became easier for citizens to travel to Rome in order to vote in elections.

== Support for the &quot;Lex Claudia&quot;, 218 BC ==
Flaminius was the only senator to support the tribune Quintus Claudius in passing his &quot;Lex Claudia&quot;, a law preventing the ownership of ships with a capacity of more than 300 amphorae by senators and their sons. The bill was passed despite strong opposition from the senate. Based on Livy&#x27;s claim that &#x27;all moneymaking was held unseemly in a senator&#x27;, modern historians have argued that Flaminius was concerned that maritime trade and profits might jeopardise the values of the Roman elite. Following this argument, Nicolet interprets the law as a Roman attempt to follow an Aristotelian, moralistic tradition in preventing magistrates from engaging in financial affairs, the law acting as a formalisation of the traditional honour code already in operation among senators. D&#x27;Arms argues instead that only profits from the sea are disreputable as they were high risk and could swiftly ruin an entire family, which was problematic for the stability of the ruling class. Cassola points out that as senators could use clients or freedmen to run their business they could circumvent the law, arguing that the law instead intended to make the entry of new men (merchants and publicans) into the senate more difficult. Yavetz contends instead that Flaminius was supporting new plebeian senators and contractors who wanted to prevent senatorial competition in their ventures. Feig Vishnia argues that publicans with ships had the most to gain from the law as they were a growing political group and through the law were the only group capable of bidding for the contracts for the delivery of supplies to armies.

The date of the law coincides with the creation of the first two Roman provinces so it was possibly intended to prevent governors from exploiting their new positions for trading profits. There also may be a connection between the law and the growing threat from Hannibal as senators involved in maritime trade provoked a war with Demetrius of Pharus and the Istrians when another faction of senators would have preferred to intervene in Hannibalic Spain instead. Feig Vishnia argues that the law was a convenient political solution for Flaminius as he could see that senatorial competition for the state contracts previously monopolised by the publicans would lead to disgruntled publicans attempting to enter political offices to address their problem. The Claudian law prevented publicans from running for office at the same time as it prevented senators from participating in large-scale maritime trade.

== Second consulship and death, 217 BC ==
Flaminius entered his second term as consul in 217 amid inauspicious beginnings. Prompted by senatorial hostility, which was inflamed by his support of the &quot;Lex Claudia&quot; in 218, and the advancing Hannibalic army, Flaminius bypassed the traditional vows and rituals of consulship within Rome to take up office at Ariminum instead. Once there, Flaminius was assigned command of the four legions of Tiberius Sempronius, who had fought and lost against Hannibal at the Trebia the previous year. Despite remarks that he was acting against the will of the gods and the senate, Flaminius proceeded to ignore senatorial summons back to Rome and instead marched his troops to Etruria.

=== The Battle of Lake Trasimene ===

With spring approaching, Hannibal had set out from his winter quarters, and aimed to seize the town of Arretium. Upon hearing this news, Flaminius hastened his army to Arretium and beat Hannibal there whilst Servilius, his colleague, travelled with other forces to Ariminum. Hannibal then pitched his camp in the marshes around Arretium and set to plundering the rich countryside of central Etruria, to incite Flaminius to give battle before Servilius arrived with reinforcements. Witnessing this destruction, despite his war council advising patience, Flaminius summoned his troops.

This call to battle was, according to Livy&#x27;s history and Cicero&#x27;s later writings, followed by a double portent of Flaminius being thrown from his mount, and the legion&#x27;s standard being unable to be moved. Despite the ill omens, Flaminius advanced with his men, straight into the ambush Hannibal had laid for the Roman troops on the plain between Lake Trasimene and the surrounding hills of Mt. Cortona. The Carthaginians were divided between the Spanish and African troops on the most visible hill, the light troops hidden in the mountains and the cavalry concealed near the narrow entrance to the plain. Once Flaminius&#x27; men entered the area they were ambushed, encircled and annihilated.

=== Death and legacy ===
Flaminius is criticised, most strongly by Polybius, for his rashness, lack of judgement, and lack of military expertise that led to this defeat. He is, however, praised by Livy for the strength and determination he displayed during the battle. The accounts of Flaminius&#x27; death vary amongst ancient sources; Polybius states he was killed by a group of Gauls, while Livy suggests it was a specific Insubrian horseman, Ducarius, who had recognised the Roman general. The overwhelming consensus, however, is that Flaminius was killed in the battle and his body never recovered, despite Hannibal searching for it in order to give his enemy a proper burial. 15,000 Roman soldiers were slain at Lake Trasimene, 6,000 were taken prisoner, and 10,000 were scattered across Etruria, eventually making their way back to Rome. Flaminius was survived by his son, Gaius Flaminius, notable for his consulship in 187 BC and wars fought against the Friniates and Apuani in Northern Italy.

== Debate over political alignment ==
Flaminius has been traditionally judged by ancient and modern historians as a style leader in opposition to the conservative Fabius Maximus. Cassola challenges this, arguing for their political association by citing their mutual opposition to Roman expansion, support for Italian interests, disdain for religious convention and claims that the votes that gave Flaminius his second consulship appointed Fabius dictator after his death. He shows that there is little evidence in the ancient sources supporting enmity between the two, although Develin emphasises that Fabius clearly opposed Flaminius&#x27; agrarian law. Develin agrees with Cassola&#x27;s case that Flaminius was Fabius&#x27; choice to serve as &quot;magister equitum&quot; under him as dictator. He argues that no consistent factional alignment or popular movement can be attributed to Flaminius, claiming his electoral and political success was primarily due to his obvious military and administrative talents. Develin believes that the only firm policies that can be linked to Flaminius are support for an Italian focus in Rome&#x27;s affairs, which coincided with Fabius&#x27; interests, the support of aristocratic values and the dismissal of religious conventions for the sake of military expediency.

<text>Baron Dunboyne was a title first held by the Petit family some time after the Norman invasion of Ireland.

==History==
Dunboyne was part of the Lordship of Meath. The Petit family also had land holdings in Mullingar. In 1227, Ralph Petit became Bishop of Meath. In that capacity, he founded a priory of the Blessed Virgin in Mullingar and he endowed this establishment with the townland of Kilbraynan (or Kilbrena) in Dunboyne, along with the rectory of Dunboyne, its tithes and other ecclesiastical revenues. A century later, Thomas Butler, son of Theobald Butler, 4th Chief Butler of Ireland, married Sinolda, heiress of William le Petit. In 1324, Butler was created Baron Dunboyne by prescription. In this way, the Dunboyne properties and titles passed to the Butlers. In 1541, the barony was created by patent in the Peerage of Ireland. The barons are alternately numbered from the early 14th century by numbers ten greater than the number dating to the patent (e.g. the 28th/18th Baron Dunboyne died May 19, 2004). The first baron of this sequence in turn married the heiress to an earlier line of Barons Dunboyne.

The family seat is Argo Hill House, near Rotherfield, East Sussex.

==Barons Dunboyne (1324)==
Kiltinan Castle, Fethard, County Tipperary, was the seat of the barons until the Reformation in Ireland.

*James Butler, 13th/23rd Baron Dunboyne (1780–1850) – see note below
*Theobald Fitzwalter Butler, 14th/24th Baron Dunboyne (1806–1881) (elected a Representative Peer in 1868)
*James Fitzwalter Clifford-Butler, 15th/25th Baron Dunboyne (1839–1899)
*Robert St John Fitzwalter Butler, 16th/26th Baron Dunboyne (1844–1913) (elected a Representative Peer in 1901)
*Fitzwalter George Probyn Butler, 17th/27th Baron Dunboyne (1874–1945)

*John Fitzwalter Butler, 19th/29th Baron Dunboyne (1951–2013)
*Richard Pierce Theobald Butler, 20th/30th Baron Dunboyne (b. 1983)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son Hon. Caspian Fitzwalter Butler.

Note As a Roman Catholic bishop, when the 12th/22nd baron inherited the titles, he feared that his vows of celibacy would lead to the extinguishment of the titles altogether. Following the refusal of the Pope to release him from his vows, he Apostatised, embraced the Church of Ireland and married late in life in the hope of fathering an heir. Following the death of a son in infancy, it looked like the title would indeed become extinct. However, a distant relative of the 2nd/12th baron was found in County Clare who succeeded to the title. His ancestry is as follows:

James Butler, 2nd/12th Baron Dunboyne married Margaret O&#x27;Brien. Their son,
* Edward Butler married Elizabeth Dobbin. Their son,
** James Butler married Janet Cantwell, daughter of Captain John Cantwell. Their son,
*** Edward Butler, was the father of
**** James Butler (died 1774) was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel
**** Michael Butler (died 15 Aug 1776) married Mary O&#x27;Leary. Their son: 
***** James Butler (died 22 May 1784) married Bridget Sheehy, daughter of Bartholomew Sheehy. He lived at Cragnagowra, County Clare. Their son:
****** James Butler, 13th/23rd Baron Dunboyne (born 25 July 1780), was the great-great-great-grandson of the 2nd/12th baron. He married Eleanor, daughter of David O’Connell, on 17 August 1799.

<doc id="479470" wikidata="Q657131" url="?curid=479470" title="Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)">
<text>Hello, I Must Be Going! is the second solo studio album by the English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins. It was released on 5 November 1982 on Virgin Records in the United Kingdom and on Atlantic Records in North America, and named after the Marx Brothers&#x27; song of the same name. After Genesis took a break in activity in late 1981, Collins started work on a follow-up to his debut solo studio album &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981).

&quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; received a more reserved commercial reaction than &quot;Face Value&quot;, but it nonetheless reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom and No. 8 in the United States. In total, Collins released eight singles from the album, with various tracks released as singles in different countries. The most successful was the first US and second UK single, a cover of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes, which went to No. 1 in the United Kingdom and No. 10 in the United States. Collins supported the album with his 1982–1983 tour, which was his first as a solo artist. The album earned Collins a Brit Award nomination for British Male Artist in 1983, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care Anymore&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male.

==Background and recording==
In December 1981, Collins&#x27;s band Genesis entered an eight-month break in activity after touring their eleventh studio album &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). He started work on a follow-up to his first solo studio album, &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981), which mainly concerned events in his personal life including his divorce from his first wife. Collins was aware that &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; contains even greater amounts of material concerning his private life, and reasoned its concentration down to feeling guilty regarding the divorce and &quot;to be purely sentimental about it&quot;. He described the album years later: &quot;If my first album was &#x27;I&#x27;m divorced and I&#x27;m miserable&#x27; ... my next one was &#x27;I&#x27;m going to kick this fucker to bits&#x27;&quot;. However, upon meeting his second wife Jill Tavelman and releasing &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;, Collins noted a change in his songwriting: &quot;[I&#x27;m] happier [...] I write happy songs now&quot;.

The album features elements of groove pop that Collins would utilise further with his next solo studio album, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (1985). &quot;I Cannot Believe It&#x27;s True&quot; has been compared to &quot;I Missed Again&quot; from &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981) &quot;right down to the undulating rhythms and swaying brass&quot;. Collins confessed to &quot;a distinct lack of judgement&quot; in recording the drums for &quot;Thru These Walls&quot; as the drum fill he used matched what he had done for &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; from &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981). To him, that is the sole comparison between the two albums, despite being called out for rehashing similar material for &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; In addition to this, according to Collins, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Steal Your Heart Away&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t It Wait &#x27;Til Morning&quot; were leftovers from the &quot;Face Value&quot; sessions in 1978-79.

The album&#x27;s sleeve contains various photographs from Collins&#x27;s family life, which he had also done for &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981). He also continued the visual style of &quot;Face Value&quot; with a facial close-up as the cover image - this time showing Collins&#x27; face in profile, with its mirror image on the reverse cover (the original CD release of the album placed this on the insert card instead). The handwritten notes were also a feature carried over from &quot;Face Value&quot;. Collins wanted both albums to be a &quot;matching set, something that felt like it was from the same bloke&quot;. Included is a picture of his young son Simon in a Superman costume, which Collins found humorous to include but later found that some people misinterpreted it as focusing the album too much on his personal life.

==Critical reception==
Hugh Fielder of &quot;Sounds&quot; praised &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; as &quot;a broader, stronger and better executed follow-up to &quot;Face Value&quot;&quot;, writing, &quot;The original inspiration may be second-hand but the execution and character is entirely his.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John Milward said of the record: &quot;Despite its trend-bucking boast of an eight-track recording, the album&#x27;s rich luster is of the old classical-rock school. In fact, the LP sounds like stripped-down Genesis, ornamental but not too ostentatious.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; writer Graham K. Smith was less enthused, criticising the lyrics as excessively self-pitying and the music as steeped in &quot;blatant textbook commercialities&quot;; he found that the album &quot;resoundly collapses between the two stools of &#x27;meaningful rock&#x27; and disposable pop, wallowing in all the worst aspects of both with none of the saving graces&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that Collins &quot;began to inject his highly melodic pop songwriting with more soul and R&amp;B influences&quot; on &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;, with mixed results: &quot;While some of the material was successful, much of it showed that he was still coming to grips with how to incorporate R&amp;B techniques into his style.&quot; In a later review of the album for AllMusic, Tim Sendra was more favourable, deeming it &quot;a winning follow-up that shows Collins to be in full control of songwriting and production&quot;.

==Tour==
Collins supported the album with a concert tour of Europe and North America between November 1982 and February 1983. He performed with a nine-piece band that included Genesis touring musicians Chester Thompson and Daryl Stuermer, and the Phenix Horns.

==Reissue==
The album was re-released using a flat transfer done by Steve Hoffman for the Audio Fidelity label in 2011 on Gold CD. The album was also reissued as part of the Take a Look at Me Now series of Collins studio album remasters during 2016, with a new second disc of bonus songs.

<doc id="479478" wikidata="Q1913658" url="?curid=479478" title="Papillary muscle">
<text>The papillary muscles are muscles located in the ventricles of the heart. They attach to the cusps of the atrioventricular valves (also known as the mitral and tricuspid valves) via the chordae tendineae and contract to prevent inversion or prolapse of these valves on systole (or ventricular contraction).

==Structure==
There are five total papillary muscles in the heart; three in the right ventricle and two in the left ventricle. The anterior, posterior, and septal papillary muscles of the right ventricle each attach via chordae tendineae to the tricuspid valve. The anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles of the left ventricle attach via chordae tendineae to the mitral valve.

===Blood supply to the left ventricle===
The mitral valve papillary muscles in the left ventricle are called the anterolateral and posteromedial muscles.
* Anterolateral muscle blood supply: left anterior descending artery - diagonal branch (LAD) and left circumflex artery - obtuse marginal branch (LCX)
* Posteromedial muscle blood supply: right coronary artery - posterior interventricular artery (RCA)
The posteromedial muscle ruptures more frequently because it only has one source of blood supply, hence RCA occlusion can cause papillary muscle rupture.

==Function==
The papillary muscles of both the right and left ventricles begin to contract shortly before ventricular systole and maintain tension throughout. This prevents regurgitation—backward flow of ventricular blood into the atrial cavities—by bracing the atrioventricular valves against prolapse—being forced back into the atria by the high pressure in the ventricles.

==Clinical significance==
Papillary muscle rupture can be caused by a myocardial infarction, and dysfunction can be caused by ischemia. Rarely, blunt chest trauma can be the cause of papillary muscle rupture, resulting from the sudden deceleration or compression of the heart. Complications may lead to worsening of mitral regurgitation.

<doc id="479484" wikidata="Q1249413" url="?curid=479484" title="I Spy (1965 TV series)">
<text>I Spy is an American secret-agent adventure television series that ran for three seasons on NBC from September 15, 1965, to April 15, 1968, and teamed American intelligence agents Kelly Robinson (Robert Culp) and Alexander &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott (Bill Cosby), traveling undercover as international &quot;tennis bums.&quot; Robinson poses as an amateur with Scott as his trainer, playing against wealthy opponents in return for food and lodging. Their work involved chasing villains, spies, and beautiful women.

The creative forces behind the show were writers David Friedkin and Morton Fine and cinematographer Fouad Said. Together they formed Triple F Productions under the aegis of Desilu Productions where the show was produced. Fine and Friedkin (who previously wrote scripts for radio&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Is My Beat&quot; and &quot;Crime Classics&quot; under producer-director Elliott Lewis) were co-producers and head writers, and wrote the scripts for 16 episodes, one of which Friedkin directed. Friedkin also dabbled in acting and appeared in two episodes in the first season.

Actor-producer Sheldon Leonard, known for playing gangster roles in the 1940s and 1950s, was the executive producer (receiving top billing before the title in the series&#x27; opening title sequence). He also played a gangster-villain role in two episodes and appeared in a third show as himself in a humorous cameo. In addition, he directed one episode and served as occasional second-unit director throughout the series.

==Background==
===Characters and settings===
&quot;I Spy&quot; broke ground in that it was the first American television drama to feature a black actor (Cosby) in a lead role. Originally an older actor was slated to play a fatherly mentor to Culp&#x27;s character. After seeing Cosby performing stand-up comedy on a talk-show, Sheldon Leonard decided to take a chance on hiring him to play opposite Culp. The concept was changed from a mentor-protégé relationship to same-age partners who were equals. It was also notable that Cosby&#x27;s race was never an issue in any of the stories, though on occasion oblique references surfaced (such as in the second-season episode &quot;One Of Our Bombs Is Missing,&quot; in which Scott jokingly said that he would &quot;join the Klan,&quot; if it would help them recover a lost atomic bomb). Nor was his character in any way subservient to Culp&#x27;s, with the exception that Culp&#x27;s &quot;Kelly Robinson&quot; was a more experienced agent. (Culp revealed in his audio commentary on the DVD release that he and Cosby agreed early on that &quot;Our statement is a non-statement&quot; regarding race, and the subject was never discussed again.) As a strait-laced Rhodes Scholar fluent in many languages, Cosby&#x27;s &quot;Scotty&quot; was really the brains of the team. His partner was the athlete and playboy who lived by his wits.

&quot;I Spy&quot; was a trailblazer in its use of exotic international locations in an attempt to emulate the James Bond film series. This was unique for a television show, especially since the series actually filmed its lead actors at locations ranging from Spain to Japan, rather than relying on stock footage. Compare with the more recent series, &quot;Alias&quot;, which also utilized worldwide settings but rarely filmed outside the Los Angeles region. Contrast the extensive use of location shooting with &quot;I Spy&#x27;s&quot; contemporaries on CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, which were mostly filmed on the Desilu and MGM back lots, respectively. Location filming is expensive and requires significantly more planning than studio filming, but the resulting quality was key to &quot;I Spy&#x27;s&quot; success. Each season the producers would select four or five scenic locations around the world and create stories that took advantage of the local attractions. Episodes were filmed in Hong Kong, Athens, Rome, Florence, Madrid, Seville, Venice, Tokyo, Mexico City, Acapulco, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Morocco.

The success of the show is primarily attributed to the chemistry between Culp and Cosby. Fans tuned in more for their hip banter than for the espionage stories, making &quot;I Spy&quot; a leader in the buddy genre. The two actors quickly developed a close friendship that mirrored their on-screen characters, a friendship that would last until Culp&#x27;s death in 2010. The show also coined unique phrases that, briefly, became catchphrases, such as &quot;wonderfulness&quot;. &quot;Wonderfulness&quot; was used as the title of one of Cosby&#x27;s albums of stand-up comedy released concurrently with the series. Cosby also occasionally slipped in bits of his comic routines during his improvised badinage with Culp. (In one episode Scott, being interrogated under the influence of drugs, says his name is Fat Albert.) Many details of Cosby&#x27;s life were also written into his character. Scott does not drink or smoke—while Kelly Robinson does both. There are frequent references to Scott&#x27;s childhood in Philadelphia and attending Temple University (Cosby is sometimes seen wearing his own Temple sweatshirt), and in the &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; episode, Scotty returns home to Philadelphia to revisit his old neighborhood.

The two main characters are Kelly Robinson and Alexander Scott. They have been operating together as a two man team for a couple of years when the series begins. It is indicated that Robinson is a few years older and has been in the Department longer than Scott (however a third season flashback episode shows them going through initial training together, so that aspect of the backstory changed a little).

Robinson is an internationally ranked and modestly well known tennis player, but not a professional player. This was in the pre-Open era of international tennis and the major championships were for amateur players only, so Robinson ostensibly travels the world as a &quot;tennis bum&quot;, playing tournaments and hobnobbing with celebrities and politicians. It is his cover for his espionage activities. He is a graduate of Princeton University and a veteran of the Korean war where he was an infantry platoon leader as a lieutenant. He was a track and field athlete as well as a tennis player in his school years. Kelly&#x27;s age and childhood background are inconsistently dealt with during the series. If a Korean War veteran, he&#x27;d be about 35-37 during the run of the series. In one episode he is said to be originally from Ohio, but in others he calls &quot;the West Coast&quot; his original home. In one episode he states that his father was a military lawyer and was involved in prosecuting German war criminals after World War II. In another episode it is indicated that he was orphaned before he was an adult and spent time with an aunt and uncle living on a farm in an unspecified location, possibly the Central Valley of California. He runs into a former love interest from time to time, and states that he ended the most serious romantic relationship of his life in order to enter into his intelligence career. He can be emotional and hot-headed at times, but can also be cold and ruthless when needed.

Scott is an intellectual, a graduate of Temple University, where he starred on the football team, and is a Rhodes Scholar. He is a linguist who seems to have studied multiple foreign languages in his educational years. He is approximately 29 years old during the series and was recruited into the intelligence community by a college professor. He grew up in urban Philadelphia where his mother and sister still live and he writes to or calls his mother frequently. He is usually the more level headed of the two agents and less emotional, but when he does become emotional he can be very despondent or display a violent temper. He is proud of his accomplishments and acknowledges the fact that the US has issues it could improve upon, but is a very loyal and patriotic American.

Both agents often question the morality of their profession and ponder the impact the life they lead has on their psyche and their soul. The two men are very close, often referring to one another as being like a brother. Yet they both seem to wonder what kind of life and family they would have had if they had not gone into the espionage world.

Robinson is usually called by his first name, Kelly, by his friends, while Alexander Scott is most often called “Scottie” by his friends.

===Comedy and drama===

&quot;I Spy&quot; was a fixture in the popular secret agent genre of the 1960s—a trend that began with the James Bond films. By 1965, virtually every studio was producing secret agent TV shows, films, and spin-off merchandise. What set &quot;I Spy&quot; apart from contemporary programs such as &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; was its emphasis on realism. There were no fanciful 007-style gadgets, outlandish villains or campy, tongue-in-cheek humor. Although Culp and Cosby frequently exchanged breezy, lighthearted dialog, the stories invariably focused on the gritty, ugly side of the espionage business.

Occasionally the series produced purely comedic episodes such as &quot;Chrysanthemum,&quot; inspired by &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, and &quot;Mainly on the Plains&quot; with Boris Karloff as an eccentric scientist who thinks he&#x27;s Don Quixote. However, most episodes dealt with more serious subjects (e.g., heroin addiction in &quot;The Loser&quot;) and did not shy away from ending on a somber note. It was also one of the very few American dramatic television series of the 1960s (&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was another) to set an episode in the then-taboo region of Vietnam. The 1966 episode was &quot;The Tiger,&quot; written by Robert Culp, and during filming a romance ensued between Culp and Vietnamese–French guest star France Nuyen. The two were married the following year, and Nuyen went on to appear in several more episodes.
===Plotlines and stories===

The espionage plots were, with a few exceptions, realistically set in the Cold War and the real life geopolitics of the mid-1960’s. They often specifically referred to their opponents as “the Russians”, or “the Chinese”, or other Communist Bloc countries of the time. Only rarely was a fictitious city or country used as a plot device. The espionage plots were almost always plausible – with a couple of comedic exceptions – and actual Cold War events were frequently alluded to or used as the basis for a plot. Other contemporary geopolitical factors that appeared in certain episodes were Arab nationalism and the idea of a potential Jihad, domestic terrorism within the United States itself, Neofascist organizations, and escaped war criminals from World War II.

The name of the espionage unit they worked for was never specified. In one flashback episode, it is established that all agents took their original training at The Presidio Army post in San Francisco, and that the agency was NOT the CIA but was in fact “more military than the CIA”. At least two episodes begin with them receiving a briefing at the Pentagon, they frequently refer to the Pentagon as the ultimate headquarters of their organization, and they are often seen receiving their instructions from uniformed, high ranking, military officers - with all branches of the military - Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force - showing up in such a role. In one episode, they are being briefed at the beginning by British military officers. However, they also seem to be answerable to the State Department as well, frequently getting instructions from civilian administrators at or from the local American Embassy in the nation they are operating in. In at least one episode they directly refer to the American ambassador as someone who can assist them. The fictional agency they work for is usually called “The Department”, and while it seems to be sort of a cross between the Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA, its actual identity is left to the imagination of the viewer.

The two agents sometimes engage in standard espionage activities like interrogation of defectors and assisting friendly agents returning from enemy territory. However, the two main characters themselves are only twice shown operating behind the Iron or Bamboo Curtain and once in Viet Cong controlled territory. They spend all other episodes operating in the US itself or, more often, a country allied to the U.S. NATO allies Greece, Italy and British Hong Kong; U.S. ally Japan; OAS member Mexico; and U.S. unofficial (at the time) ally Spain are all locations where a storyline is set. Likewise Morocco, which was a technically neutral, but pro-West country at the time, is the setting for a few episodes. They cooperate with British, Japanese and Greek intelligence officers in various episodes and with local police officials in others, but largely their activities are unknown to the local authorities. The two agents are often seen uncovering and eliminating Soviet Bloc or Chinese espionage activities in Western nations, or uncovering a traitor in their own organization. Such activities would technically make them Counter-Intelligence agents. Occasionally they are involved in fighting against narcotic smuggling or thwarting a coup attempt against a friendly ruler. In a few episodes they are not actually on an assignment at all but have an adventure related to their personal lives, such as helping keep Scotty’s foster-daughter&#x27;s boyfriend out of trouble with the Italian police, or dealing with the angry family of a soldier who had served under Kelly in the Korean War years before and had been killed in action. While the two agents are frequently involved with attractive women who factor into their assignment, they rarely become involved with an innocent bystander who is accidentally swept up into the situation as was the usual plotline of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

Top-billed series star Culp wrote the scripts for seven episodes (one of which he also directed), including the show&#x27;s first broadcast episode, &quot;So Long, Patrick Henry.&quot; Prior to joining &quot;I Spy&quot;, Culp wrote a pilot script for a proposed series in which he would have played an American character like James Bond. He took the script to his friend Carl Reiner, who recommended he meet with Sheldon Leonard, who was in the midst of creating &quot;I Spy&quot;. This script was eventually rewritten by Culp and produced as the episode &quot;The Tiger.&quot; In the DVD audio commentary for the &quot;Home to Judgment&quot; episode, Culp reveals that his seven episodes were the only ones filmed exactly as written. He wrote them to establish a specific dramatic tone and level of quality for the other writers to follow. Nevertheless, Culp and Cosby were often dissatisfied with the frivolous and formulaic scripts they received and rewrote most of their dialog and improvised a great deal during filming.

===Awards and nominations===
* First-time actor Bill Cosby won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1966, 1967 and 1968 (becoming the first African-American male actor to do so). Robert Culp was also nominated in the same category for all three seasons of &quot;I Spy&quot;.
* Eartha Kitt, who played a drug-addicted cabaret singer in &quot;The Loser&quot; (written by Culp), was nominated in 1966 for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Drama.
* In 1967 Culp was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in a Drama for his third-season script &quot;Home to Judgment.&quot;
* In addition to writing the theme music, Earle Hagen composed an original musical score for many episodes of the series, often flavored with the ethnic music of the Far East, Mexico or the Caribbean. Hagen received Emmy nominations for all three seasons of the show and won for the &quot;Laya&quot; episode in 1968.
* &quot;I Spy&quot; won as &quot;Best Dramatic Series&quot; at the 1967 Golden Globe Awards for its 1966–1967 season.

==Remakes==
In &quot;I Spy Returns&quot; (1994), a nostalgic television movie (and unsold pilot episode for a new series), Culp and Cosby reprised their roles as Robinson and Scott for the first time since 1968. The original opening title sequence is reused with no changes other than the addition of the word &#x27;Returns&#x27; beneath &#x27;I Spy&#x27; and a new arrangement of the theme music. Cosby was the executive producer. Unlike the original series, the TV-movie was shot on videotape instead of film. Here, Robinson has become director of the agency, while Scott has left the business. However, the aging agents have to leap into action once again, this time to keep an eye on their children, Bennett Robinson (George Newbern) and Nicole Scott (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) who are now operatives. This was shown as a &quot;CBS Movie Special&quot; on February 3, 1994.

Culp again reprised the role of Kelly Robinson during a dream sequence in a 1999 episode of Bill Cosby&#x27;s series &quot;Cosby&quot; titled &quot;My Spy.&quot; Cosby&#x27;s character falls asleep while watching &quot;I Spy&quot; on television and dreams he&#x27;s caught up in an espionage adventure. With Cosby&#x27;s name replaced with that of his character here, Hilton Lucas, the old title sequence was again faithfully recreated. (Culp had earlier appeared with Cosby in 1987 on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; episode &quot;Bald and Beautiful&quot; as Cliff Huxtable&#x27;s old friend &quot;Scott Kelly&quot;, a merger of their &quot;I Spy&quot; characters&#x27; names.)

A film adaptation, also titled &quot;I Spy&quot;, followed in 2002 with Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson. In this iteration, the character names are reversed, so Alexander Scott (Wilson) is now the white secret agent and Kelly Robinson (Murphy) the black athlete, now a boxer (It also changed the original premise of them both being agents, with Robinson being a civilian boxer who is essentially brought in to act as Scott&#x27;s cover story while he carries out his mission). The film was initially a commercial and critical failure. In his 2009 &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, film critic Leonard Maltin describes the film as an &quot;In-name-only reincarnation of the smart 1960s TV show... An object lesson in bad screenwriting, with an incoherent story, and characters that make no sense.&quot;

==Merchandising==

===Original novels, comic books, and reference books===

A number of original novels based upon the series were published, most written in the mid-to-late 1960s by Walter Wager under the pseudonym &quot;John Tiger.&quot; The &quot;I Spy&quot; novels were published by Popular Library:

* &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965, no book series number on cover)
* I SPY #2: &quot;Masterstroke&quot; (1966)
* I SPY #3: &quot;Superkill&quot; (1967)
* I SPY #4: &quot;Wipeout&quot; (1967)
* I SPY #5: &quot;Countertrap&quot; (1967)
* I SPY #6: &quot;Doomdate&quot; (1967)
* I SPY #7: &quot;Death-Twist&quot; (1968)

The following tie-ins, not by Wager, were also published.

* &quot;Message From Moscow&quot; (1966) by Brandon Keith. This was a hardcover novel published for young readers by Whitman.
* &quot;I Spy&quot; (2002) by Max Allan Collins – novelization of the motion picture remake

Gold Key Comics also published six issues of an &quot;I Spy&quot; comic book between 1966 and 1968.

* &quot;I Spy: A History and Episode Guide to the Groundbreaking Television Series&quot; by Marc Cushman and Linda J. LaRosa

=== Games ===
Ideal published a board game in 1965.

===Soundtracks===
Unlike many television series of the time, every episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; received an original score – as was the case with the other shows from Sheldon Leonard, like &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Earle Hagen, Leonard&#x27;s regular composer, wrote the main theme and scored most of the episodes (collaborating on three with Carl Brandt; Hugo Friedhofer, Nathan Van Cleave, Robert Drasnin and Shorty Rogers also wrote music for the series). During the show&#x27;s run, two albums of re-recorded music composed (except where indicated) and conducted by Hagen were released.

==Home media==
The underlying rights to the original series are now owned by independent film company Peter Rodgers Organization, Ltd. (PRO), but original production company Triple F Productions remains the copyright holder.

Selected episodes of the series were made available on VHS in North America in the early 1990s.

Image Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 in 2002, initially in a series of single-disc volumes (each with four episodes), which were later compiled into three box sets. The episodes were not presented in any particular order. In addition, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the 1994 reunion made-for-TV film on DVD in Region 1 on October 8, 2002.

In April 2008, Image/PRO reissued the series, this time organized in order of original broadcast, in three box sets, one for each season. This includes Robert Culp&#x27;s bonus audio commentary on four episodes that he wrote (originally issued in 2002 on a single DVD called &quot;The Robert Culp Collection&quot;).

On March 7, 2014, it was announced that Timeless Media Group had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and will be releasing a complete series set on June 24, 2014.

In Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment has released all 3 seasons on DVD in Australia.

== Syndication ==
In September 1982, the religious cable channel Christian Broadcasting Network began airing &quot;I Spy&quot; nationwide on weeknights at 8:00 PM and continued to do so for the next 2+ years. In 1986, Nick at Nite added &quot;I Spy&quot; to its evening lineup at 9:00 and continued to air the program until the Fall of 1987. In 2011, &quot;I Spy&quot; aired twice a day, six days a week, on FamilyNet. The series also airs in the United States on broadcast television channels Retro Television Network and the Soul of the South Network. In 2015, reruns of &quot;I Spy&quot; were pulled by the Aspire and Cozi TV networks as a result of allegations of sexual assault by Cosby.

<doc id="479487" wikidata="Q4862334" url="?curid=479487" title="Baron Dunalley">
<text>Baron Dunalley, of Kilboy in the County of Tipperary, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 31 July 1800 for Henry Prittie, who had previously represented Banagher, Gowran and County Tipperary in the Irish House of Commons. His son, the second Baron, represented Carlow in the Irish Parliament and Okehampton in the British House of Commons and also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1828 to 1854. He was succeeded by his nephew, the third Baron. When he died the barony was inherited by his son, the fourth Baron. He was an Irish Representative Peer between 1891 and 1927 and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Tipperary. the title is held by his great-grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 1992.

The family house was Kilboy House, near Nenagh, County Tipperary, which was built in 1771 to the design of William Leeson Architect. The house was torched by the IRA on 8 August 1922. A compensation claim was made to the new Irish Government, but the payment which they made was not sufficient to return the house to its former glory.

<text>In medicine, decompensation is the functional deterioration of a structure or system that had been previously working with the help of compensation. Decompensation may occur due to fatigue, stress, illness, or old age. When a system is &quot;compensated,&quot; it is able to function despite stressors or defects. Decompensation describes an inability to compensate for these deficiencies. It is a general term commonly used in medicine to describe a variety of situations.

== Medical term==
For example, &quot;cardiac decompensation&quot; may refer to the failure of the heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, after long-standing (previously compensated) vascular disease (see heart failure). Short-term treatment of cardiac decompensation can be achieved through administration of dobutamine, resulting in an increase in heart contractility via an inotropic effect.

Kidney failure can also occur following a slow degradation of kidney function due to an underlying untreated illness; the symptoms of the latter can then become much more severe due to the lack of efficient compensation by the kidney.

== Psychology ==
In psychology, the term refers to an individual&#x27;s loss of healthy defense mechanisms in response to stress, resulting in personality disturbance or psychological imbalance.

<text>Baron Decies, of Decies in the County of Waterford, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1812 for the Right Reverend William Beresford, Archbishop of Tuam from 1794 to 1819. He was the third son of Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone, and the younger brother of George Beresford, 1st Marquess of Waterford. His son, the second Baron, married Charlotta Philadelphia Horsley, the only daughter and heiress of Robert Horsley (1749-1809) of Bolam Hall in Northumberland, which he built (using stone from the ruined ancient castle on the site) on the estate purchased in 1727 by his father John Horsley. In accordance with the terms of his wife&#x27;s inheritance he assumed the additional surname of Horsley in 1810. However, none of the subsequent barons have held this surname. His grandson, the fifth Baron, was a Major in the Army and also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1912 to 1944. the title is held by his grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded his father in 1992.

The family seat is Straffan Lodge, near Straffan, County Kildare.

<doc id="479508" wikidata="Q220392" url="?curid=479508" title="Zooxanthellae">
<text>Zooxanthellae (; zooxanthella) is a colloquial term for single-celled dinoflagellates that are able to live in symbiosis with diverse marine invertebrates including demosponges, corals, jellyfish, and nudibranchs. Most known zooxanthellae are in the genus &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;, but some are known from the genus &quot;Amphidinium&quot;, and other taxa, as yet unidentified, may have similar endosymbiont affinities. &quot;Zooxanthella&quot; was originally a genus name (meaning literally &quot;little yellow animal&quot;) given in 1881 by Karl Brandt to &quot;Zooxanthella nutricula&quot; (a mutualist of the radiolarian &quot;Collozoum inerme&quot;) which has been placed in the Peridiniales. Another group of unicellular eukaryotes that partake in similar endosymbiotic relationships in both marine and freshwater habitats are green algae zoochlorellae.

Zooxanthellae are photosynthetic organisms, which contain chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c, as well as the dinoflagellate pigments peridinin and diadinoxanthin. These provide the yellowish and brownish colours typical of many of the host species. During the day, they provide their host with the organic carbon products of photosynthesis, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host&#x27;s energy needs for metabolism, growth and reproduction. In return, they receive nutrients, carbon dioxide, and an elevated position with access to sunshine.

==Morphology and classification==

Zooxanthellae can be grouped in the classes of &quot;Bacillariophyceae&quot;, &quot;Cryptophyceae&quot;, &quot;Dinophyceae&quot;, and &quot;Rhodophycaeae&quot; and of the genera &quot;Amphidinium&quot;, &quot;Gymnodinium&quot;, &quot;Aureodinium&quot;, &quot;Gyrodinium&quot;, &quot;Prorocentrum&quot;, &quot;Scrippsiella&quot;, &quot;Gloeodinium&quot;, and most commonly, &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;. Zooxanthellae of genus &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; belong to a total of eight phylogenetic clades A-H, differentiated via their nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA.

Zooxanthellae are autotrophs containing chloroplasts composed of thylakoids present in clusters of three. A pyrenoid protrudes from each chloroplast and is encased along with the chloroplast by a thick, starchy covering. Within the cell’s cytoplasm also exists lipid vacuoles, calcium oxalate crystals, dictyosomes, and mitochondria. The cell wall of zooxanthellae varies in structure across species. One structure consists of an outer membrane, middle layer compact with electrons, and a thin inner layer. In other species, the characteristics of this low-density inner layer make up the cell wall’s entire structure. Beneath the cell wall is the cell membrane, and beneath the cell membrane are thecal vesicles.

DNA in the cell exists in the form of chromatin coils tightly compacted together. It is condensed in the nucleus alongside an atypical histone complement. The DNA possesses ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that is folded and of similar morphology to rRNA in archaeobacteria. This indicates that RNA is important for DNA packaging in zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae, in addition to all other dinoflagellates, possess 5-hydroxymethyluracil and thymidine in their genomes, unlike any other eukaryotic genome.

==Life history==
Zooxanthellae alternate between life phases expressed as cysts and as motile organisms in the water column. In zooxanthellae of the genus &quot;Gymnodinium&quot;, one possible life cycle of the cell begins as an immature cyst which reaches maturity then divides to form an immature cyst once more. Once growing into an older cell, it becomes no longer useful. In the life cycle of a motile zooxanthellae cell, its youngest stage is known as a zoosporangium, which matures into a zoospore capable of motility. This motile cell produces and releases gametes for reproduction.

===Vegetative phase===
The vegetative phase in the life cycle of a zooxanthellae is the predominant form of the organism. In this form, the single-celled organism has a thin cell wall. As opposed to the zoospore, the zooxanthella contains numerous chloroplasts. Once the cell continues growing, however, chloroplasts decrease in abundance. The vegetative cell will either divide into two separate daughter cells or transition into a cyst stage.

===Cyst stages===
The most common phases in the life history of zooxanthellae following the vegetative phase are cysts, dividing cysts, and degenerate cysts. Cysts possess a thick cell wall yet retain the composition of the cytoplasm and constitute the majority of clustered zooxanthellae in host tissues. This stage of the cell provides the host with a reddish-brown hue. Dividing cysts make up a fourth of the composition of zooxanthellae clusters in host tissues and are expressed as cell stages where two daughter cells remain adjoined but possess individual cell walls. Degenerate cysts are present in clusters, though rare, and lose much of their mutualistic benefit to the host they reside in due to a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. The young zoosporangium and motile zoospore stages, though seen in zooxanthellae life cycles, are much rarer amongst clades. The zoospore resides in the zoosporangium until the cell wall of the cyst bursts. Zooxanthellae is only motile if it originates as a zoospore.

===Motility===
Zooxanthellae in the zoospore stage exhibit motility as forward movement or gyratory movement. In moving forward, the organism rotates on the posterior flagellum’s axis whilst simultaneously propelling through the water column. The zoospore gyrates through the water column via attachment of the posterior flagellum to a substrate.

==Ecology==

===Endosymbiont acquisition===
Zooxanthellae are particularly associated with reef-building corals but they also inhabit other invertebrates and protists; their hosts include many sea anemones, jellyfish, nudibranchs, certain bivalve molluscs like the giant clam &quot;Tridacna&quot;, sponges and flatworms as well as some species of radiolarians and foraminiferans. Many different species of zooxanthellae are present in host organisms, each species with its own adaptive capabilities and degree of tolerance of varying environmental factors.

A juvenile organism or newly established colony can acquire its zooxanthellae via sexual reproduction or directly from the environment. The egg from which the individual developed may have already been infected by zooxanthellae at the time of fertilization, or cells of the symbiont may have been transferred from the mother in a period during which the larva was brooded by its parent. Alternatively, the new individual may acquire the zooxanthellae direct from sea water in which the dinoflagellates freely live at some stages of their life cycle. Some stony corals use chemotaxis, with infection occurring as a result of the emission by the coral of a chemical attractant. Infection may also occur after ingestion of infected faecal matter by the host, or of prey that already houses the symbionts. Such indirect acquisition can result in the new host being infected by a species of zooxanthella different from that present in its parent.

===Symbiosis with coral===
A zooxanthella in symbiosis with coral is contained in vacuoles of the host’s gastrodermal cells and is of the genus &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;. Zooxanthellae provide nutrients to their host cnidarians in the form of sugars, glycerol, and amino acids and in return gain carbon dioxide, phosphates, and nitrogen compounds. A coral exposed to environmental stressors can result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from host tissues. This in turn strips the coral of its color, in this phenomenon known as coral bleaching, where the now-transparent tissues of the coral reveal its white internal skeletal structure. Variations in salinity, light intensity, temperature, pollution, sedimentation, and disease can all impact the photosynthetic efficiency of zooxanthellae or result in expulsion from their mutualistic relationships.

The physiological mechanisms behind endosymbiont expulsion remain under research but are speculated to involve various means of detachment of zooxanthellae or gastrodermal cells from host corals. During a bleaching event, entire gastrodermal cells containing zooxanthellae may leave the host. In other cases, gastrodermal cells will remain in the host tissues, but zooxanthellae contained in vacuoles may separately undergo damage or may physically leave the cells and enter the surrounding environment.

=== Clams and Zooxanthellae ===
Coral is not the only aquatic organism to be affected by bleaching and the expulsion of zooxanthellae; clams have also been found to undergo a similar process when temperatures become too high.  However, clams discard zooxanthellae that are still alive and have been observed being able to recover them. This not only has positive indications for the clams themselves, but also the surrounding ecosystem. For many organisms, clams are a vital part of the food chain. Not only can they themselves be eaten, but excrement from giant clams contains live zooxanthellae. Opportunistic feeders and clams alike use excreted zooxanthellae as a nutrient source. The consumption of zooxanthellae is especially vital for a clam in its veliger stage as it encourages growth.   Zooxanthellae are not only found in clam excrement, but in the mantle tissue as well where they take up ammonia and nitrate. They are also found in the eyes of clams like &quot;Tridacna&quot; where they act as a lens. Different clades of zooxanthellae have an impact on clam morphology. Clade E1 of zooxanthellae seems to influence or favor smaller offspring from clams when compared to clams harboring other clades and all five clades appear to be needed in order for larval settlement to occur.

=== Jellyfish and Zooxanthellae ===
Jellyfish and zooxanthellae have a history together in the scientific world as &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; was first cultured from the jellyfish &quot;Cassiopea,&quot; a model jellyfish species. Many different types of zooxanthellae have been observed forming relationships with jellyfish across many different phylogenetic branches, and the roles they play will change throughout the jellyfish’s life cycle. However, as the jellyfishes ages, the diversity of zooxanthellae attaching to them decreases, suggesting that zooxanthellae compete with each other to form relationships with the jellyfish. Not all jellyfish form relationships with these microbes and for the most part the ones that do are found in tropic and subtropic waters. The relationship between jellyfish and zooxanthellae is affected a little differently than coral in terms of climate change despite both of them being a part of the cnidaria family. One study suggested that certain species of jellyfish and their symbiotic zooxanthellae may have some type of resistance to decreasing pH caused by climate change to a certain point. Although, jellyfish bleaching events have been documented during extreme heat events. While the causal factors that normally seem to affect the relationship between zooxanthellae and their host may not apply to jellyfish, light intensity does. Light availability can affect the lipid production of zooxanthellae that the jellyfish then utilize. To maximize their light uptake, jellyfish will both swim near the surface and do very specific migrations.  The migration patterns also assist with helping the zooxanthellae access specific nutrients.  Many of these jellyfish appear to be mixotrophic consuming both live prey and utilizing phototrophy. This may be what helps jellyfish survive climate change and bleaching as they could switch feeding methods rather than attempting to recover lost zooxanthellae quickly. There are many unknowns in when it comes to the relationship between zooxanthellae and jellyfish that scientists look to answer.

<doc id="479509" wikidata="Q7719352" url="?curid=479509" title="The Books of Homilies">
<text>The Books of Homilies (1547, 1562, and 1571) are two books together containing thirty-three sermons developing the authorized reformed doctrines of the Church of England in depth and detail, as appointed for use in the 35th Article of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. The longer title of the collection is Certain Sermons or Homilies Appointed to Be Read in Churches. They belong to the basic formularies of the Church of England.

==Revision and reform==
Following the secession of the Church of England from the jurisdiction of the Church of Rome in 1530, and the designation of the monarch, Henry VIII of England, as the chief power in both the civil and ecclesiastical estates of the realm, it was needed for the establishment of the English Reformation that the reformed Christian doctrines, theology, piety, and practice should be explained and taught as widely as possible among all throughout the realm. Although the liturgy had formerly been conducted entirely in Latin, and holy communion (consisting only of the consecrated bread) was administered twice a year, the progress of reformed faith had long been developing unofficially among the populace at all levels, as much through the Wycliffite tradition, as through the new learning in the universities in its wider European context.

===The &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;===
Attempts to reformulate the doctrine of the English Church, led by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer under Thomas Cromwell as Vicegerent, begun with the adoption of the (partly Lutheran) Ten Articles in 1536, was augmented in 1537 by a volume of disquisitions known as the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot;, or &quot;The Institution of a Christen Man&quot;. This book was divided into four sections as follows:* The exposition of the Apostles&#x27; Creed* The declaration of the Seven Sacraments* The exposition of the Ten Commandments* The exposition of the &quot;Pater noster&quot; and the &quot;Ave&quot;, with the articles of Justification and Purgatory. Dedicated by the bishops to King Henry, this was first ordered to be read from the pulpits, but then suppressed with a view to revision. In 1539 the Six Articles were enacted in law, a reactionary formula with severe penalties for violation.

The revised work called the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;, or &quot;The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for Any Christen Man&quot;, was deliberated upon at the Convocation of 1540 (at the time of Cromwell&#x27;s fall) and published in 1543. The &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; contained sections as follows, as in the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Book&quot; giving lengthy paraphrases or expositions on each of the various articles within the sections, line by line:* The declaration of Faith* The articles of our belief, called the Creed* The seven sacraments* The ten commandments of almighty god* Our lord&#x27;s prayer called the Pater noster* The salutation of the angel, called the Ave Maria* An article of free will* An article of justification* An article of good works* Of prayer for souls departed.

==Edwardian Reform: the &quot;First Book of Homilies&quot; (1547)==

It was under Thomas Cranmer, the reformist Archbishop of Canterbury through the later reign of King Henry (Defender of the Faith) and that of Edward VI (ruled 1547–1553), that the doctrine presented in the first volume (1547) of the Homilies, &quot;Certayne Sermons, or Homelies appoynted by the kynges Maiestie&quot;, was formulated. The Six Articles were repealed in the same year. An authorized, unified and clearly expressed statement of doctrine for public understanding was needed, to be placed in the hands of the priesthood at large to deliver it. The preface to the first edition, as under King Edward&#x27;s authority advised by his Protector, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, takes as its premise the need to cast off the &quot;manifold enormities&quot; and &quot;ungodly doctrine&quot; of the adherents of the &quot;Bishoppe of Rome&quot;, which (it says) has led so many away &quot;from doing the commandments of God, unto voluntary works and fantasies invented of men&quot;. It was the king&#x27;s command that the parsons, vicars and curates should read through the homilies Sunday by Sunday (except when a sermon was to be delivered) until the whole book was read, and then to begin again.

This volume therefore preceded the publication of the reformed liturgy in the Edwardian Book of Common Prayer of 1549, its revision of 1552, and the issuing of the Forty-two Articles in 1553. Volume I contains twelve sermons and was mainly written by Cranmer. They focus strongly upon the character of God and Justification by Faith and were printed by the King&#x27;s Printers, Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch. 
The homilies are:
At the end of the first volume appeared the following statement:&quot;Hereafter shall follow Homilies of Fasting, Prayer, Almose-deeds, of the Nativity, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Saviour Christ: of the due Receiving of his Body and Blood, under the form of Bread and Wine: against Idleness, against Gluttony and Drunkenness, against Couetousness, against Envy, Ire and Malice: with many other matters, as well fruitful and necessary to the edifying of Christian people, and the increase of godly living. GOD SAVE THE KING.&quot; In this way the completion of the work was projected in 1547.

==Elizabethan Reform: the &quot;Second Book of Homilies&quot; (1563, completed 1571)==

The First Book saw a new edition in 1562, the homilies divided into parts for better understanding: in its preface, the Queen&#x27;s injunction for them to be read was given. This, and the editions of 1563, 1567 and of 1571, in which the Second Book of homilies and sermons was added, belong to the time of Matthew Parker as archbishop, from the commencement of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I until his death in 1575. They followed that interruption to the Reforms occasioned by Queen Mary I (ruled 1553–1558) and the Roman Catholic Archbishop Reginald Pole (1556–1558), and the execution of Thomas Cranmer (author of much of the first volume) as a heretic in 1556. The Forty-two Articles had not been enforced during Mary&#x27;s reign, during which the English Church was reunited with that of Rome, but at once regained importance in Elizabeth&#x27;s religious settlement.

===1563===
The Second Book, mainly written by Matthew Parker with Bishop John Jewel and others, was printed perhaps in two or more editions by Richarde Iugge and John Cawood, &quot;printers to the Queenes Maiestie&quot;. According to Parker, the Homilies had already been printed in 1562 and only awaited the Queen&#x27;s approval at Midsummer 1563 for final publication. Entitled &quot;Certayne Sermons appoynted by the Queenes Maiestie&quot;, it contained twenty sermons. Reprints appeared in succeeding years. The publication followed the Convocation&#x27;s approval of Thirty-Nine Articles, from which the Queen removed a further article to pacify objections from her Catholic subjects. These complete the promised scope of the Homilies as projected in the final notice of the First Book.

===1571===

The full second series of twenty-one homilies, entitled &quot;The Second Tome of Homilees&quot;, was published in 1571. The reinstatement of the Thirty-ninth Article, and the publication of the Second Book of Homilies containing the final, twenty-first homily (&quot;against Disobedience and wilful Rebellion&quot;), followed the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth by the papal bull named &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;. The Thirty-fifth Article (still so mandated today) states:&quot;The second Book of Homilies, the several Titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholsom Doctrine, and necessary for these Times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were set forth in the time of &quot;Edward&quot; the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the People.&quot;
This volume includes:
===Character of the Homilies===
Many of the sermons are straightforward exhortations to read scripture daily and lead a life of prayer and faith in Jesus Christ; the other works are lengthy scholarly treatises intended to inform church leaders in theology, church history, the fall of the Byzantine Empire and those aspects of the Roman Catholic Church and doctrine from which the Reformed Anglican faith had turned away. Each homily is heavily annotated with references to holy scripture, the Church Fathers and other primary sources.

The longest homily is the second of the second book, &quot;Against Peril of Idolatry&quot;, which runs to about 136 printed pages (pp. 25–161 in the 1571 edition) and is divided into three parts. The first part elaborates the Mosaic law against the worship of images, and down to St Paul&#x27;s condemnations: the second part follows the patristic writings on the same point, and traces from the Iconoclastic Controversy (which underlay the schism between Western and Eastern churches, and aroused Rome&#x27;s hostility towards the parts of Christendom not under papal authority). The third part presents, from the perspective of the Reformed Church, a history of such Roman Catholic religious teachings and practices as were deemed to have led to idolatrous observances, as, for instance:&quot;And where one saint hath images in divers places, the same saint hath divers names thereof, moste lyke to the Gentiles. When you heare of our Lady of Walsingham, our Lady of Ipswich, our Lady of Wilsdon, and suche other: what is it but an imitation of the Gentiles idolaters? &quot;Diana Agrotera, Diana Coriphea, Diana Ephesia&quot;, etc., &quot;Venus Cipria, Venus Paphia, Venus Gnidia&quot;. Whereby is evidently meant, that the saint for the image sake, shoulde in those places, yea in the images them selves, have a dwellyng, whiche is the grounde of theyr idolatrie. For where no images be, they have no such meanes&quot; (at p. 99).

The homilies contain many historical spellings, based on the Vulgate and Septuagint, of Biblical names such as Noe for Noah and Esay for Isaiah. The colourful expression &quot;mummishe massyng&quot; appears in the fifteenth sermon of the second book (&quot;Of the worthy receaving of the Sacrament&quot;), not to characterize the Mass itself, but (on the contrary) to describe those who come to the Lord&#x27;s Supper &quot;unreverentlye, not discerning the Lordes bodye&quot; (like the Corinthians blamed by St Paul, &quot;I Corinthians&quot;, xi, 27–29), with &quot;rude and unreverent ignoraunce&quot;, as if it were a mime-show.

== Editions ==

The following recensions were issued down to 1623, some under public authority:
* Richard Jugge, Queen&#x27;s Printer (died 1577): Volumes I and II (1574); Volumes I and II (1576–1577), in quarto
* Christopher Barker, Queen&#x27;s Printer and Henry Middleton: Volumes I and II (1582), in quarto
* John Charlewood and Thomas East: Volumes I and II (1587), in quarto
* Edward Allde: Volumes I and II (1595), in quarto
* John Bill, King&#x27;s Printer: Both parts (with numerous revisions) united (1623), in folio

Some later recensions include:
* John Norton, for Joyce Norton and Richard Whitaker (London, 1633/1635)
* Ralph Hodkinson and John Norton for Richard Whitaker (London 1640 [1650])
* Thomas Roycroft, for Andrew Crooke, Samuel Mearne and Robert Powlet (London 1673)
* Thomas Roycroft, for Samuel Mearne and Robert Powlet (London 1676)
* Ann Mearn and Blanch Pawlet (London 1683)
* For Moses Pitt, Peter Parkins and Thomas Guy (The Theatre, Oxford 1683)
* George Wells, Abel Swall and George Pawlett (London 1687), &quot;for use of private families&quot;

The edition of the Homilies most widely available today is that edited in 1859 by John Griffiths and originally published by Oxford University Press. An earlier edition published by Oxford in 1822 has been criticised for its heavy editing.

A critical edition of the Homilies appeared in 2015, edited by Gerald Bray. An edition of the First Book of Homilies in modern English was published in 2021 for the Church Society, edited by Lee Gatiss.

==Reception in the United States==
The Episcopal Church&#x27;s version of the Articles endorses the &quot;content&quot; of the Homilies, but states that it suspends the order for reading them until they can be updated.

Born in Houston, Texas, Annette Strauss graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1944. She moved to New York City where she received master&#x27;s degrees in sociology and psychology from Columbia University. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society and Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. She worked as a Red Cross social worker in Houston for a year until she married Ted Strauss, Sr. Managing Director of Bear Stearns, in 1946 and moved to Dallas in 1947.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Strauss worked tirelessly as a fundraiser for various charities and organizations and also as a volunteer for a number of other organizations. She worked on behalf of the Dallas Symphony, the Crystal Charity Ball, Southern Methodist University, the United Way of America, the United Jewish Appeal, the Dallas Black Dance Theatre, Baylor University Medical Center and many other groups. Her efforts helped to raise millions for the arts in Dallas. Strauss was also one of the founding members of the Volunteer Center of North Texas.

Using her many connections in the city, Strauss was elected to a Dallas City Council seat in 1983. She became deputy mayor pro tem and then mayor pro tem in 1984. In 1987, Strauss ran for mayor of Dallas and won with 56 percent of the vote. Her opponents included the Texas Republican state chairman, Fred Meyer, a Dallas businessman originally from suburban Chicago.

During her tenure as mayor, Strauss helped to lead a city suffering from a sharp economic downturn.

While Mayor-Pro Tem, Annette spearheaded the effort to build a refuge for an increasing number of families living on the streets, victims of the collapsed Texas economy. The vision was a facility where homeless families could stay together as a family unit. A coalition of congregations responded, and Family Gateway was born. Originally named the Downtown Family Shelter, the S. St. Paul, 30-room facility was rededicated as the Annette. G. Strauss Family Gateway Center in 2000. The Center provides a private room, food and clothing for homeless families with children; coupled with the child care, educational and employment resources they need to recover from crisis and make positive choices for their future. Today, Family Gateway has grown to include transitional housing and permanent supportive housing units in the community to serve the growing number of homeless families. After 25 years Annette&#x27;s original vision for Family Gateway continues today; to empower homeless families to break the cycle of homelessness and embrace a life of hope and promise.

In 1991, Strauss left the mayoral position and worked as a consultant and trustee for a number of boards and foundations, including the Children&#x27;s Medical Center Foundation, the Dallas Methodist Hospitals Foundation, the St. Paul Hospital Foundation, the Timberlawn Foundation and the Texas Historical Foundation. She was also appointed &quot;Ambassador-at-large&quot; for the city of Dallas, an honorary position she held until her death from cancer in 1998. She was interred at Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery. Her husband Ted Strauss died on September 5, 2014.

==Awards==
Strauss was awarded the H. Neil Mallon Award by the World Affairs Council in 1995. The H. Neil Mallon Award, hosted by the World Affair Council of Dallas/ Fort Worth, is presented annually to individuals who have excelled at promoting the international focus of North Texas. The prestigious Mallon Award is named after the Council’s founder and is presented annually to individuals who have excelled in promoting our region’s international profile. Funds raised from this event support the World Affair Council’s public and education programming, international exchanges, and diplomatic services. 
== Legacy ==
In recognition of her many years of humanitarian service, many things have been named for Annette Strauss, including the Annette G. Strauss Family Gateway Center, the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas at Austin and also the Annette Strauss Artist Square, an open-air Performing Arts area in downtown Dallas.

<doc id="479512" wikidata="Q1044785" url="?curid=479512" title="Better Business Bureau">
<text>The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is an American private, 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization founded in 1912. BBB&#x27;s self-described mission is to focus on advancing marketplace trust, consisting of 92 independently incorporated local BBB organizations in the United States and Canada, coordinated under the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (IABBB) in Arlington, Virginia.

The Better Business Bureau is not affiliated with any governmental agency. Businesses that affiliate with BBB and adhere to its standards do so through industry self-regulation. To avoid bias, BBB&#x27;s policy is to refrain from recommending or endorsing any specific business, product or service even though they still advocate for business interests.

The BBB rating system uses an A+ through F letter-grade scale. The grades represent BBB&#x27;s degree of confidence that the business is operating in good faith and will resolve customer concerns filed with BBB. BBB&#x27;s ratings are explained on its Ratings Overview page. BBB employees evaluate a business&#x27;s behavior when assigning a rating.

According to BBB, nearly 400,000 local businesses in North America were accredited as of July 2022. BBB prospects successfully vetted businesses to become dues-paying &#x27;accredited businesses&#x27; that pledge and continue to adhere to the BBB Code of Business Practices. In return, BBB allows accredited businesses in good standing to use its trademarked logo in marketing materials.

==History==
The concept of the Better Business Bureau has been credited to several court cases, such as &quot;United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola&quot;, initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the Coca-Cola Company in 1906.

In 1909, Samuel Candler Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the American Advertising Federation (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the &quot;Ten Commandments of Advertising,&quot; one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission, Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) was established by a merger of the Association of Better Business Bureaus and the National Better Business Bureau. The Council of BBBs included the Philanthropic Advisory Service (PAS), which advised donors about national charities. PAS later merged with the National Charities Information Bureau to form the BBB Wise Giving Alliance.

In 2019 the Council of BBBs split into three entities - the BBB Wise Giving Alliance (advice for donors to charities), BBB National Programs (national industry self-regulatory programs), and the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (BBB&#x27;s self-governing organization.)

==Structure and funding==
Each BBB is overseen by its own board of directors and chief executive officer. Each must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the IABBB. The IABBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as several independent subject matter experts such as academics and legal experts. BBBs are chiefly funded by local accredited businesses, which also make up BBB boards of directors. A study by a business school dean at Marquette University found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.

Businesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. IABBB is funded primarily by membership dues from BBBs, which vary from year to year.

===Dispute resolution procedures===
BBB handles complaints from consumers about their marketplace experiences with businesses, and also publishes customer reviews both positive and negative. The organization provides dispute resolution through procedures established by the International Association of Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no‑cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB. BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.

Complaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions. BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternate entity.

If BBB receives a consumer dispute, BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that BBB compiles ratings based upon their ability to collect money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance. However, since 2010, no relationship exists between a business&#x27;s rating and its accreditation status.

==Rating system and accreditation==
Until 2008, BBB rated companies &quot;satisfactory&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactory.&quot; On January 1, 2009, BBB moved to a new system based on a school-style A+ to F rating system. The 16 factors have been posted on each business profile since the program&#x27;s inception and the details on the points awarded as well. Initially there was a 17th factor worth 4 points for businesses that were Accredited. That process was changed in November 2010 in response to criticism in the media and from the Connecticut attorney general who accused BBB of using &quot;pay to play&quot; tactics. The Attorney General of Connecticut demanded that BBB stop using its weighted letter grade system, calling it &quot;potentially harmful and misleading&quot; to consumers. In response, the Council of Better Business Bureaus changed the BBB ratings system to cease awarding points to businesses for being BBB members, and to institute closer monitoring of BBB sales practices.

If a business chooses not to provide basic information, such as size and start date, BBB may assign a not-rated (NR) rating. An &quot;NR&quot; rating due solely to a company not providing information would state: &quot;BBB does not have sufficient background information on this business.&quot;

A business is eligible for BBB accreditation if it meets, in the opinion of BBB, &quot;BBB Standards for Trust&quot;. There are eight BBB Standards for Trust that BBB expects its accredited businesses to adhere to: build trust (&quot;maintain a positive track record in the marketplace&quot;), advertise honestly, tell the truth, be transparent, honor promises, be responsive (address marketplace disputes), safeguard privacy (protect consumer data) and embody integrity.

==Criticism==
In 2010 ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; reported in a segment titled &quot;The Best Ratings Money Can Buy&quot; about the irregularities in BBB ratings. They reported that a man created two dummy companies which received &quot;A+&quot; ratings as soon as he had paid the membership fee to the BBB of the Southland, serving the Los Angeles area. They also reported that business owners in Los Angeles were told that the only way to improve their rating was by paying the fee. In one case a &quot;C&quot; was turned to an &quot;A&quot; immediately after a payment and in another case a C‑minus became an &quot;A+&quot;. The chef Wolfgang Puck said that some of his L.A.-based businesses received F ratings because he refused to pay a fee. These allegations led to procedures against the BBB of the Southland from the BBB system. On March 12, 2013, the Council of Better Business Bureaus expelled the Los Angeles-based Better Business Bureau of the Southland, the largest local BBB, claiming that the group had not met the Council&#x27;s &quot;standards relating to accreditation, reporting on businesses, and handling complaints.&quot; The Los Angeles chapter disputed the charges and continued to operate under the new name of Business Consumer Alliance. From March to November 2013, BBB served the four-county Los Angeles area via a &quot;Virtual BBB&quot; staffed by volunteers from other BBBs. The effort won the American Society of Association Executives &quot;Power of Association&quot; award. In November 2013 the Council of Better Business Bureaus reassigned the Los Angeles area to three established California BBBs.

In 2011, a &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist described a complaint from a consumer that the Austin chapter of the Better Business Bureau refused to resolve complaints against companies if customers do not pay a $70 mediation fee.

===Integration of US and Canadian operations===
On August 16, 2011, the then-named Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced the formal integration of operations in the United States &amp; Canada, effective immediately.

According to the statement, integration marks the way &quot;for an improved customer experience for those who purchase goods and services across the border&quot;. Stephen A. Cox, President and CEO of CBBB, said: &quot;The U.S. and Canada remain each other&#x27;s largest trading partners. We are really one North American marketplace, and the BBB system now reflects that. Not only will it be easier for consumers to check out businesses in either country, it will be simpler for them to file a complaint or resolve a dispute.&quot; The move was supported by the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus (CCBBB). &quot;Given the advances in technology and the globalization of services, it no longer makes sense to maintain two separate systems,&quot; said M. Jean Lemyre, chair of the CCBBB. &quot;The vast majority of consumers initially contact BBB through the Internet. Aligning BBB services into one integrated system will be more efficient for businesses in Canada, and will ensure that consumers continue to receive the high quality of services they&#x27;ve come to expect from BBB.&quot;

===BBB trademark authorization revoked from four Canadian offices===
The then-named Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) revoked the BBB name &amp; trademark from four Canadian Better Business Bureaus. The CBBB said it made the move to withdraw trademark authorization from the offices in Hamilton, Windsor, Montreal and St. John&#x27;s after determining these four Canadian offices did not meet the defined standards of operation.

CBBB realigned the boundaries of its affected Canadian offices and folded them into larger offices. Hamilton has been gathered under the banner of the BBB&#x27;s Kitchener office, while the territories in SW Ontario (including Windsor) are now part of the Western Ontario region based in London, ON.

The Hamilton, Montreal &amp; St. John&#x27;s offices have also changed their names or closed following what they termed a takeover by the U.S.-based Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Hamilton, Ontario BBB adopted the name Canadian Businesses and Charity Bureau. In May 2012, the Hamilton organization was locked out of its office by its landlord in a rent dispute and ceased to operate. The Montreal BBB changed its name to L&#x27;Office de Certification Commerciale du Québec or Québec Commercial Certification Office, while the BBB in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland closed. These areas have since been picked up by others, and as of August 2022, all of Canada is served by 10 BBBs.

<doc id="479513" wikidata="Q972424" url="?curid=479513" title="Old-time music">
<text>Old-time music is a genre of North American folk music. It developed along with various North American folk dances, such as square dancing, contra dance, clogging, and buck dancing. It is played on acoustic instruments, generally centering on a combination of fiddle (see old time fiddling) and plucked string instruments, most often the banjo, guitar, and mandolin. Together, they form an ensemble called the string band, which along with the simple banjo–fiddle duet have historically been the most common configurations to play old-time music. The genre is considered a precursor to modern country music.

==History==
Reflecting the cultures that settled North America, the roots of old-time music are in the traditional musics of the British Isles, Europe, and Africa. African influences are notably found in vocal and instrumental performance styles and dance, as well as the often cited use of the banjo; in some regions, Native American, Spanish, French and German sources are also prominent. While many dance tunes and ballads can be traced to European sources, many others are of North American origin.

===Etymology===
Old-time music, particularly when encompassing ballads and other vocal forms, is likely the oldest form of North American traditional music other than Native American music, and thus the term &quot;old-time&quot; is an appropriate one. In popular usage at 21st century fiddlers&#x27; conventions and summer music camps, it frequently describes styles of pre-bluegrass fiddle and banjo music as played in the Southern United States, so that &quot;bluegrass banjo&quot; and &quot;bluegrass fiddle&quot; can be judged separately. However, definitions of the phrase vary historically and geographically, including racially segregated titles used in record catalogs of the 1920s and 1930s, literal use to describe nostalgic song and tune collections over the years, and concert organizers&#x27; and record companies&#x27; use of the phrase in the 1960s to identify traditional instrumental and vocal music by rural white and black musicians, distinct from the then-commercialized &quot;folk revival&quot; music that included urban &quot;interpreters&quot; and singer-songwriters (See &quot;Revival&quot; below). 

Contemporary fiddler&#x27;s conventions, music camps and festivals often use the terms &quot;old-time&quot; and &quot;old-time string band&quot; interchangeably, heavily weighted toward instrumental performance and often placing vocal music in a separate folk song category. 

When some of its early country music recordings became hits, the Okeh company, which had previously coined the terms &quot;hillbilly music&quot; to describe Appalachian and Southern fiddle-based and religious music and &quot;race record&quot; to describe the music of African American recording artists, began using &quot;old-time music&quot; as a term to describe the music of white artists including Fiddlin&#x27; John Carson, who began recording in 1923.

The term thus originated as a euphemism, but proved a suitable replacement for other terms that were considered disparaging by many inhabitants of these regions. It remains the term preferred by performers and listeners of the music. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;old-timey&quot; or &quot;mountain music&quot; by long-time practitioners.

===Other sources===
The early 19th century Minstrel Show configuration of banjo, fiddle, rhythm bones and tambourine, at first performing tunes learned from black players, soon added tunes adapted from white players previous European-roots repertoire, and songs composed specifically for those ensembles, such as those of Stephen Foster, some of which are still in the old-time string band repertoire. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the guitar and mandolin became increasingly available, as well as factory made banjos, and tunes originating in Tin Pan Alley, gospel, ragtime, blues and other musics were adapted into the old-time style. People played similar music in all regions of the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, but by the mid 20th century it was associated primarily with rural areas, particularly the Appalachian region.

===Revival===
Important revivalists including Mike Seeger and Pete Seeger brought banjo and string-band music to New York City as early as the 1940s. The New Lost City Ramblers in particular took the revival across the country and often featured older musicians in their shows. The band was originally Mike Seeger, John Cohen, and Tom Paley. When Tom left the band, he was replaced by Tracy Schwarz. New Lost City Ramblers sparked new interest in &quot;old-time&quot; or &quot;old-timey&quot; music, and wrote about it in record notes, magazine articles, and the New Lost City Ramblers Songbook, later reissued as the &quot;Old-Time String Band Songbook&quot;.

Folkways Records, founded in 1948, began to use the phrase &quot;old time music&quot; prominently in conjunction with Mike Seeger, the New Lost City Ramblers, other performers (e.g., Canadian fiddler Jean Carignan), and events (&quot;The 37th Old Time Fiddler&#x27;s Convention at Union Grove North Carolina&quot;), including a 1960s New York City organization called the &quot;Friends of Old-Time Music&quot; (F.O.T.M. for short), with headquarters at Izzy Young&#x27;s Folklore Center in Greenwich Village. The group&#x27;s mission, as outlined in Richard Rinzler&#x27;s booklet accompanying a concert collection, was to &quot;reach deep into the grassroots and bring traditional folk music, performed by traditional artists, to the New York City area.&quot; Under its &quot;Old-Time Music&quot; umbrella, rather than the phrase &quot;folk music&quot; then being used heavily by commercial record companies and young singer-songwriters, the group presented a wide range of older black and white traditional and &quot;roots&quot; musicians, including Southern singers, fiddlers, banjo players, guitarists and string bands in styles ranging from unaccompanied and banjo-accompanied ballad-singing to bluegrass and blues artists, some of whom had recorded as early as the 1920s. (Among the concert performers were Clarence Ashley, Dock Boggs, Gus Cannon, Jesse Fuller, Roscoe Holcomb, Mississippi John Hurt, Furry Lewis, Bill Monroe, the Stanley Brothers, and Doc Watson.) 

A 2006 three-CD box set from Folkways reissued more of the original 14 concerts, under the title &quot;Friends of Old Time Music: The Folk Arrival 1961-1965,&quot; accompanied by a 60-page book by Peter K. Siegel, with essays by John Cohen (musician) and Jody Stecher. Among its observations, &quot;When Ralph Rinzler, Cohen and Young decided to call their new organization the Friends of Old Time Music, they were referring to language that had been used by the commercial recording industry almost four decades earlier.&quot; In a separate essay, Cohen observes, &quot;Ralph and I looked for name for our proposed organization, one that would avoid the pitfalls of the word &#x27;folk,&#x27; for we needed to establish our own distinct identity as something apart from the folk revival,&quot; with its &quot;commercialization of folk music by the music industry&quot; and &quot;urban performers who were interpreting and inventing folk music&quot;.

Vanguard Records used &quot;Old Time Music at Newport&quot; as the title for one of its several LPs from the Newport Folk Festival of 1963, including several Southern players who had performed at FOTM concerts and Folkways records, and others: Clarence &quot;Tom&quot; Ashley, Doc Boggs, Maybelle Carter, Jenes Cottrell, Dorsey Dixon, Clint Howard, Fred Price, and Doc Watson. The New Lost City Ramblers were included on a &quot;Country Music and Bluegrass at Newport&quot; record, and Mississippi John Hurt was among performers on &quot;Blues at Newport.&quot; Ashley, whose band featured Doc Watson, appeared on both the &quot;Old Time&quot; and &quot;Country Music and Bluegrass&quot; collections.

Arhoolie Records in 1962 started a label called &quot;Old Timey,&quot; reissuing dozens of LPs based on old 78s by old-time string bands and more -- not only volumes of &quot;Old-Time Southern Dance Music: Ballads And Songs,&quot; but &quot;Pioneers Of Cajun Accordion 1926-1936,&quot; &quot;Amadé Ardoin* – The First Black Zydeco Recording Artist (His Original Recordings 1928-1938),&quot; &quot;Classic Country Duets,&quot; and collections of &quot; Western Swing, Blues, Boogie And Honky Tonk.&quot;

==Instrumentation==
Old-time music is played using a wide variety of stringed instruments. The instrumentation of an old-time group is often determined by what instruments are available, as well as by tradition. The most common instruments are acoustic string instruments. Historically, the fiddle was nearly always the leading melodic instrument, and in many instances (if no other instruments were available) dances were accompanied only by a single fiddler, who often also acted as dance caller.

By the early 19th century, the banjo had become an essential partner to the fiddle, particularly in the southern United States. The banjo, originally a fretless instrument made from a gourd, provided rhythmic accompaniment to song, dance and the fiddle, incorporating a high drone provided by the instrument&#x27;s short &quot;drone string.&quot; The banjo used in old-time music is typically a 5-string model with an open back (i.e., without the resonator found on most bluegrass banjos).
Today, old-time banjo players most commonly utilize the clawhammer style, but there were numerous styles, most of which are still used to some extent today. The major styles are down-picking (generally referred to today as &quot;clawhammer,&quot; though historically myriad names were used to describe it), two-finger index lead, two-finger thumb lead, and a three-finger &quot;fiddle style&quot; that seems to have been influenced in part by late-19th century urban classical style. Young players might learn whatever style a parent or older sibling favored, or take inspiration from phonograph records, radio, traveling performers and migrant workers, local guitarists and banjo players, as well as other musicians they met when traveling to neighboring areas. Having a fiddle play the lead melody with a banjo playing rhythmic accompaniment is the most common form of Appalachian old-time music today.

Individualistic three-finger styles were developed independently by such important figures as Uncle Dave Macon, Dock Boggs, and Snuffy Jenkins. Those early three-finger styles, especially the technique developed by Jenkins, led to the three-finger Scruggs style created by Earl Scruggs in the 1940s, which helped advance the split between the old-time genre and the solo-centric style that became known as bluegrass. Jenkins developed a three-finger &quot;roll&quot; method that, while obviously part of the old-time tradition, inspired Scruggs to develop the smoother, faster and more complex rolls that are now standard fare in bluegrass music.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, musicians began to add other stringed instruments to the fiddle-banjo duo—including guitar, mandolin, and double bass (or washtub bass). These provided chordal, bass line, and pitched rhythmic accompaniment, and occasionally took over the melody, usually during a &quot;break&quot; section that lasted the duration of a verse, refrain, or verse and refrain. This, along with a Dobro (resonator guitar), is also considered &#x27;standard&#x27; bluegrass instrumentation, but old-time music tends to focus on sparser instrumentation and arrangements compared to bluegrass. Such an assemblage, of whatever instrumentation, became known simply as a &quot;string band.&quot; Less frequently used are the cello, piano, hammered dulcimer, Appalachian dulcimer, tenor banjo, tenor guitar, lap-steel guitar, mandola, mouth bow, as well as other instruments such as the jug, harmonica, autoharp, jaw harp, concertina, button or accordion, washboard, spoons, or bones.

The fiddle is sometimes played by two people at the same time, with one player using the bow and fingers, while another player stands to the side and taps out a rhythm on the fiddle strings using small sticks called fiddlesticks (also spelled &quot;fiddle sticks&quot;). This technique (also sometimes called &quot;beating the straws&quot;) is utilized in performance most notably by the duo of Al and Emily Cantrell.

Each regional old-time tradition accompanies different dance styles. Some of these include clogging and flatfoot dancing (Appalachia), contra dancing (New England), square dancing (Southern states) and step dancing (Nova Scotia, particularly Cape Breton Island), though there is some overlap between regions.

==Regional styles==
There are numerous regional styles of old-time music, each with its own repertoire and playing style. Nevertheless, some tunes (such as &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Joy&quot;) are found in nearly every regional style, though played somewhat differently in each.

===Appalachia===

Appalachian folk music was brought to the United States by immigrants and slaves. In turn it influenced country music and old-time music.

As a result of the terrain of the region, the societies and cultures were fairly isolated from outside intervention. In 1916, Cecil Sharp arrived in Appalachia and began recording the folk songs on the Mountains. Sharp, an authority on British ballads, was able to identify 1,600 versions of 500 songs from 281 singers, almost all having their origins in the English/Scottish Child Ballads. After his first study in Appalachia, he published &quot;English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians&quot;. Some examples of songs preserved in the Appalachian Mountains and recorded by Sharp include, &quot;The Hangman Song&quot;, &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;, etc. The primary sources for many of Sharp&#x27;s recordings came from a string of related families around Shelton Laurel, N.C. Of note is the fact that these families maintained a specific, unique vocal tradition and traditional English lyrical pronunciations across several generations, until gaining fame in the 1960s and 1970s through similar field recordings completed by John Cohen. These records featured Dillard Chandler, Berzilla Wallin (recorded by Sharp) and Dellie Norton. Relatives of those individuals continue to keep this unique vocal style alive to this day.

A Scottish fiddler named Niel Gow (note the unorthodox spelling) is usually credited with developing (during the 1740s) the short bow sawstroke technique that defines Appalachian fiddling. This technique was altered during the next century, with European waltzes and polkas being most influential.

African Americans, who were not only slaves but also free blacks working in timber, coal mining, and other industries, influenced Appalachian music as the banjo was adopted from African Americans by white musicians (such as Joel Walker Sweeney) in the years leading up to the Civil War.

Appalachian folk became a major influence on styles like country music and bluegrass. It is one of the few regional styles of old-time music that, since World War II, has been learned and widely practiced in all areas of the United States and Canada (as well as in Europe, Australia, and elsewhere). In some cases (as in the Midwest and Northeast), its popularity has eclipsed the indigenous old-time traditions of these regions. There is a particularly high concentration of performers playing Appalachian folk music on the East and West Coasts (especially in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest). A number of American classical composers, in particular Henry Cowell and Aaron Copland, have composed works that merge the idioms of Appalachian folk music with the Old World–based classical tradition.

Appalachian old-time music is itself made up of regional traditions. Some of the most prominent traditions include those of North Georgia (the Skillet Lickers) Mount Airy, North Carolina (specifically the Round Peak style of Tommy Jarrell) and Grayson County/Galax, Virginia (Wade Ward and Albert Hash), West Virginia (the Hammons Family), Eastern Kentucky (J. P. Fraley and Lee Sexton), Middle Tennessee (Uncle Dave Macon, the McGee Brothers, Thomas Maupin, and Fiddlin&#x27; Arthur Smith), and East Tennessee (Charlie Acuff, the Roan Mountain Hilltoppers, G.B. Grayson).

The banjo player and fiddler Bascom Lamar Lunsford, a native of the North Carolina mountains, collected much traditional music during his lifetime, also founding the old-time music festival in Asheville, North Carolina. Notable North Carolina traditional banjo players and makers include Frank Proffitt, Frank Proffitt Jr. and Stanley Hicks, who all learned to make and play fretless mountain banjos from a family tradition. These players, among others, learned their art primarily from family and show fewer traces of influence from commercial hillbilly recordings. The Proffitts and Hicks were heirs to a centuries-old folk tradition, and through the middle to late 20th century they performed in a style older than the stringbands often associated with old time music. Their style has been recently emulated by contemporary musician Tim Eriksen.

The Southern states (particularly coastal states such as Virginia and North Carolina) also have one of the oldest traditions of old-time music in the United States.

States of the Deep South such as Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana also have their own regional old-time music traditions and repertoires, as does the Ozark Mountains region of Arkansas and Missouri. While the music of the Louisiana Cajuns has much in common with other North American old-time traditions it is generally treated as a tradition unto itself and not referred to as a form of old-time music.

===Native American===
Several distinctive Native American and First Nations old-time traditions exist, including Métis fiddle and Athabaskan fiddle.

Old-time music has also been adopted by individual Native American musicians including Walker Calhoun (1918–2012) of Big Cove, in the Qualla Boundary (home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Matthew Kinman of the Apache Tribe, and Wovoka Herrera of the Northern Paiute people . Calhoun played three-finger-style banjo and sang in the Cherokee language.

===New England===
The New England states, being among the first settled by Europeans, have one of the oldest traditions of old-time music. Although the Puritans (the first Europeans to settle in the region), frowned upon instrumental music, dance music flourished in both urban and rural areas beginning in the 17th century. Primary instruments today include the fiddle, piano, and guitar, with the wooden flute sometimes also used. As with Appalachian folk, a number of classical composers have turned to New England folk music for melodic and harmonic ideas, most famously Charles Ives, as well as Aaron Copland, William Schuman, and John Cage, among others. Rhythmically, this style is more diverse than most southern old time, featuring schottisches, hornpipes, and waltzes in addition to reels.

===Midwest===
Beginning in the early 19th century, when the Midwestern states were first settled by immigrants from the eastern United States and Europe, the Midwest developed its own regional styles of old-time music. Among these, the Missouri style is of particular interest for its energetic bowing style, while Michigan is one of the few areas in North America with a continuous hammered dulcimer tradition through the twentieth century.

The region of central and southern Illinois has its own distinct style and repertoire of old-time music as well.

In the Upper Midwest, especially Minnesota, &quot;old-time music&quot; most typically refers to a mixture of Scandinavian styles, especially Norwegian and Swedish.

===Texas and the West===
Texas developed a distinctive twin-fiddling tradition that was later popularized by Bob Wills as Western swing music. Fiddle music has also been popular since the 19th century in other Western states such as Oklahoma and Colorado. The National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest has been held each year in Weiser, Idaho since 1953.

Oklahoma, with its high concentration of Native American inhabitants, has produced some Native American old-time string bands, most notably Big Chief Henry&#x27;s Indian String Band (consisting of Henry Hall, fiddle; Clarence Hall, guitar; and Harold Hall, banjo and voice), which was recorded by H. C. Speir for the Victor company in 1929.

A California old-time music scene arose from college-city folk music scenes of the 1960s and &#x27;70s, from Fresno to Berkeley, including the Sweets Mill music camps and the crossover between square dance, folk dance and instrumental music scenes, documented in oral history interviews collected by musician, teacher and author Evo Bluestein, including the contributions of multi-instrumentalists Kenny Hall, Hank Bradley, and others. The Berkeley old-time scene of the late 1960s is documented in 1971 notes by Rita Weill to the Folkways LP &quot;Berkeley Farms&quot;. The Berkeley Old Time Fiddler&#x27;s Convention, she said, was &quot;Conceived in the back of a Volkswagen bus, on the way to a party in Marin County, in 1968, by a group of people who wanted to retain the good music and inter-play they&#x27;d witnessed at Southern fiddle-banjo contests, without the competition and corruption extant there. They wished to avoid the effects of regionalism that decreed there was a right way to play a tune and a wrong way, as well. After all, they felt, who could pinpoint one tradition for Berkeley? So it happened with but one rule, &#x27;No fair &#x27;lectric instruments.

The Pacific Northwest has a vibrant old-time music community. Extending the north–south corridor from Seattle to Portland and east to Weiser, ID and Boise, gatherings and festivals such as the Portland Old Time Gathering, Festival of American Fiddle Tunes in Port Townsend, WA, an annual campout in Centralia, WA and the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest have helped build a growing and multi-generational old time music community.

===Canada===
Among the prominent styles of old-time music in Canada are the Scottish-derived tradition of Nova Scotia (particularly Cape Breton Island), the French Canadian music of Quebec and Acadia, the old-time music of Ontario, and the prairie fiddling traditions of the central-western provinces. It is here (primarily in Manitoba and Saskatchewan) that the fiddle tradition of the Métis people is found. The traditional folk music of Newfoundland and Labrador, though similar in some ways to that of the rest of Atlantic Canada, has a distinct style of its own. As such, it is generally considered as its own genre.

==Contemporary musicians==
The current old-time music scene is alive and well, sparked since the mid-1990s by the combined exposure resulting from several prominent films, more accessible depositories of source material, institutions like the Field Recorders Collective, and the work of touring bands, including the Freight Hoppers, the Wilders, Uncle Earl, Old Crow Medicine Show, Glade City Rounders, Foghorn Stringband, and the Carolina Chocolate Drops. Contemporary old-time music often blends styles with closely related genres, such as bluegrass or other types of folk music. 

A new generation of old-time musicians performs as solo acts and band leaders all over the country, including: Brad Leftwich, Dan Levenson, Bruce Molsky, Rafe Stefanini, Bruce Greene, Rhys Jones, Rayna Gellert, Riley Baugus, Leroy Troy, Alice Gerrard, Dirk Powell, Walt Koken, Clifton Hicks, and Martha Scanlan. The Appalachian dulcimer has long been a part of string bands in the Galax, Virginia, area and is seeing new popularity re-emerging as a key instrument for old-time music, thanks to the influence of musicians such as Don Pedi, David Schnaufer, Lois Hornbostel, Wayne Seymour his disciples, Milltown and Stephen Seifert. American hammered dulcimer players like Ken Kolodner, Mark Alan Wade and Rick Thum continue this tradition. Family bands, such as The Martin Family Band, from Maryland, are continuing the traditions of old time music played on fiddle, banjo, lap dulcimer, hammered dulcimer, mandolin, piano, guitar, bass and percussion. The Carolina Chocolate Drops and the solo careers of former members Rhiannon Giddens and Dom Flemons have directly addressed the nearly lost tradition of black stringband music.

Other practitioners of the music included Charlie Acuff of Alcoa, Tennessee, Chester McMillian of Mount Airy, North Carolina, Lee Sexton of Line Fork, Kentucky, Thomas Maupin of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, George Gibson of Knott Co., Kentucky, Michael Defosche in Jackson County, Tennessee, Rob Morrison of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Jimmy Costa of Talcott, West Virginia, Curtis Hicks of Chattanooga, Tennessee, Clyde Davenport of Monticello, Kentucky, Delmer Holland of Waverly, Tennessee, and Harold Luce of Chelsea, Vermont.

==Festivals==

Prominent old-time music festivals (some of which also include bluegrass, dance, and other related arts) include the Northern Lights Bluegrass and Old Tyme Music Camp and Festival in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada (established 2005), Old Fiddler&#x27;s Convention in Galax, Virginia (established 1935), the West Virginia State Folk Festival in Glenville, West Virginia (established 1950), the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest in Weiser, Idaho (established 1953), the Mount Airy Fiddlers Convention in Mount Airy, North Carolina (established 1972), Uncle Dave Macon Days in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the Vandalia Gathering in Charleston, West Virginia (established 1977), the Appalachian String Band Music Festival in Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia (established 1990), Breakin&#x27; Up Winter in Lebanon, Tennessee, the Winfield Music Festival is held in Winfield, Kansas and the Smithville Fiddlers&#x27; Jamboree and Crafts Festival held in Smithville, Tennessee (established in 1972).

==Dancing==
Because old-time fiddle-based string band music is often played for dances, it is often characterized as dance music. There are also long-standing traditions of solo listening pieces and fiddle songs, such as those documented in West Virginia by Erynn Marshall in &quot;Music in the Air Somewhere: The Shifting Borders of West Virginia&#x27;s Fiddle and Song Traditions&quot; (WVU Press, 2006). In dance music as played by old-time string bands, emphasis is placed on providing a strong beat, and instrumental solos, or breaks, are rarely taken. This contrasts with bluegrass music, which developed in the 1940s as concert music. Bluegrass music developed from old-time music and shares many of the same songs and instruments, but is more oriented toward solo performance than is old-time music.

Many different types of dancing are done to old-time music, such as square dancing, contra dancing, and buck dancing.

While in the British Isles reels and jigs both remain popular, the reel is by far the predominant metric structure preferred by old-time musicians in the United States (though a few hornpipes are also still performed). Canadian musicians, particularly in the Maritime provinces where the Scottish influence is strong, perform both reels and jigs (as well as other types of tunes such as marches and strathspeys).

==Education==
Players traditionally learn old-time music by ear; even musicians who can read music. A broad selection of written music does exist, although many believe that the style of old-time music cannot be practically notated by written music. This is in part because there are many regional and local variations to old-time tunes, and because some of the most noted players often improvised and wouldn&#x27;t play a tune exactly the same way every time.

Players usually learn old-time music by attending local jam sessions and by attending festivals scattered around the country. With the spread of broad-band Internet, more and more old-time recordings are available via small publishers. Internet streaming audio (&quot;Web radio&quot;), and small Web sites make the music more accessible.

Although it is one of the oldest and most prominent forms of traditional music in the United States and Canada, old-time music (with a few notable exceptions) is generally not taught in North American primary schools, secondary schools, or universities. Although square dancing is still occasionally taught in elementary schools (generally with recorded, rather than live music), old-time instruments and dances are not included in the educational system, and must be studied outside the school system.

===Appalachia===

The Digital Library of Appalachia provides online access to archival and historical materials related to the culture of the southern and central Appalachian region, including audio recording samples. Contents are drawn from special collections of Appalachian College Association member libraries.

Located in Johnson City, Tennessee, East Tennessee State University offers a comprehensive program in bluegrass and old time music studies. The program includes a variety of bluegrass and country music courses, both performance-oriented and academic. Minors in both Bluegrass and in Appalachian Studies are also offered.

There are a variety of programs, mostly in the summer, such as the Augusta Heritage Festival in Elkins, W.V., The Swannanoa Gathering at Warren Wilson College, Blue Ridge Oldtime Music Week at Mars Hill University, the Cowan Creek Mountain Music School, or the Appalachian String Band Music Festival at Clifftop, W.V., that offer week-long immersions in old-time music and dance. These camps are family friendly and allow beginners to enter into the tradition and more advanced players to hone their sound with instruction from some of the best in the music.

In Floyd, Virginia, music lessons, workshops, and immersive &quot;Old Time Music Get Together&quot; long-weekend camps are offered by The Handmade Music School, a non-profit spin-off of local music venue The Floyd Country Store.

===Outside Appalachia===
A growing number of folk music schools in the greater United States, usually non-profit and community-based, have taken up the mantle of providing instruction in old-time music:
The Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, Illinois began in 1957. Pinewoods Camp in Massachusetts, founded in 1935, has included Appalachian music and dance in its summer programs for many years, as well as British Isles music and dance. Numerous other folk-music and dance camps with &quot;themed&quot; weeks, like the Ashokan Center in New York, include specific &quot;Southern&quot; or &quot;Old-time&quot; weeks. 

These schools and the subsequent music communities that spring from them offer a positive trend in keeping old-time music alive. Also, universities such as Berklee College of Music, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Brown University, UCLA, and Florida State University have &quot;Old Time Ensembles&quot; to teach and keep Old Time music alive.
Regular old-time jam circles are also important to spreading and teaching this music. Regular old-time jams occur not only throughout the United States, but in places as far flung as Beijing, China, where the Beijing Pickers jam spawned a bluegrass/Americana group the Randy Abel Stable and the old-time band the Hutong Yellow Weasels.
In the UK, Friends of American Old Time Music and Dance was formed in 1995. A year later Sore Fingers Summer School was started.

<doc id="479541" wikidata="Q2704556" url="?curid=479541" title="Atlantean language">
<text>The Atlantean language is a constructed language created by Marc Okrand specially for the Walt Disney Feature Animation film &quot;&quot;. The language was intended by the script-writers to be a possible mother language, and Okrand crafted it to include a vast Indo-European word stock with its very own grammar, which is at times described as highly agglutinative, inspired by Sumerian and North American Indigenous languages.

==Creation==

The Atlantean language (&quot;Dig Adlantisag&quot;) is a historically constructed, artistic language put together by Marc Okrand for Disney&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot; and associated media. The Atlantean language is therefore based both on historic reconstructions as well as on the elaborate fantasy/science fiction of the &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot; mythos. The fictional principles upon which the Atlantean language was created are: Atlantean is the “Tower of Babel language”, the “root dialect” from which all languages descended; it has existed without change since sometime before 100,000 B.C., in the First or Second Age of Atlantis until the present.

To accomplish this, Okrand looked for common characteristics from various world languages and was also heavily inspired by the Proto-Indo-European language. His main source of words (roots and stems) for the language is Proto-Indo-European, but Okrand combines this with Biblical Hebrew, later Indo-European languages such as Latin and Greek, and a variety of other known or reconstructed ancient languages.

==Writing systems==
Atlantean has its own script created expressly for the movie by John Emerson with the help of Marc Okrand, and inspired by ancient alphabetical scripts, most notably Semitic. There are, however, different kinds of transliteration into the Roman script.

===Atlantean Script===

There is no punctuation or capitalization in the native Atlantean Writing System. Okrand based this on ancient writing systems. The Atlantean Script is normally in boustrophedon, that is to say it is written left to right for the first line, right to left the second, and left to right again the third, to continue the pattern. This order was also suggested by Okrand, based on ancient writing systems, and it was accepted because, as he explained, &quot;It&#x27;s a back-and-forth movement, like water, so that worked.&quot;

The Atlantean script includes more characters than are actually employed in the language itself. These letters being c, f, j, q, v, x, z, ch, or th, they were created so that Atlantean might be used as a simple cipher code in the media and for promotional purposes. They are all also based on diverse ancient characters, just like the rest of the alphabet.

===Roman Script===
Apart from the native Atlantean script created for the show, the language can be transcribed using the Roman script. There are two versions for doing so:

# Standard Transcription, how the language is transliterated by Marc Okrand himself.
# Reader&#x27;s Script, a Berlitz-style notation devised by Okrand, which he hoped would make the Atlantean easier to read for the actors.

Example sentence, broken down:

The following is a table that shows the correspondences between the different modes of transcription and also provides the probable IPA values.

===Numerals===
John Emerson, Marc Okrand, and the filmmakers also created numerals for 0–9. They are stacked horizontally, however, and hold place values of 1, 20, and 400. Their components are based on Mayan numerals and internally composed for the font (example above) like Roman numerals. If used according to the now-offline Official Website&#x27;s directions, they are used, alternatively, like Arabic numerals.

====Numeral suffixes====
Ordinals are formed adding the suffix -&quot;(d)lag&quot;: &quot;sey&quot; &#x27;three&#x27;, &quot;seydlag&quot; &#x27;third&#x27;. The &quot;d&quot; is omitted if the root ends with an obstruent or nasal consonant: &quot;dut&quot; &#x27;two&#x27;, &quot;dutlag&quot; &#x27;second&#x27;. Fractions are formed with the suffix -&quot;(d)lop&quot;: &quot;kut&quot; &#x27;four&#x27;, &quot;kutlop&quot; &#x27;quarter&#x27;, &quot;sha&quot; &#x27;five&#x27;, &quot;shadlop&quot; &#x27;fifth (part)&#x27;. And finally, distributives are formed with the suffix &quot;noh&quot;: &quot;din&quot; &#x27;one&#x27;, &quot;dinnoh&quot; &#x27;one at a time, one each&#x27;.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===

===Vowels===
Atlantean&#x27;s phonetic inventory includes a vowel system with five phonemes. Most vowels have two prominent allophonic realizations, depending on whether it occurs in a stressed or unstressed syllable.

Vowels in stressed syllables tend to be tense, and likewise unstressed ones tend to be more lax. Thus, for example, is realized as or in stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively. Likewise, is realized as or , and so on. There are three diphthongs, namely &quot;ay, ey, oy&quot;.

Aside from the stressed-syllable-based vowel system, the only other example of prominent phonological phenomenon seems to be a special kind of sandhi occurring in verbs, when the pronoun is combined with the aspect marker.

When the suffix for the first person singular -&quot;ik&quot; combines with tenses that employ -i, -o (Past and Future tenses), it becomes -&quot;mik&quot;.
:bernot-o-ik → bernot-o-mik

But when combined with suffixes that feature -e (Present tenses), the same suffix becomes -&quot;kik&quot;.
:bernot-e-ik → bernot-e-kik

==Grammar==
Atlantean has a very strict subject–object–verb word order, with no deviations from this pattern attested. Adjectives and nouns in the genitive case follow the nouns they modify, adpositions appear only in the form of postpositions, and modal verbs follow the verbs that they modify and subsequently take all personal and aspectual suffixes. However, adverbs precede verbs. The language includes the use of an interrogative particle to form questions with no variation in word order.

Some sentences appear to employ some kind of particles sometimes termed &quot;sentence connectors&quot;. These particles are of obscure meaning but are theorized to relate two clauses in a logical yet idiomatic manner. The exact meaning and usage of these particles is not known, but without them sentences are difficult to reconcile with their translations.

In the example above there is no actual mention of the consequences for outsiders, yet the subtitle in the movie translates it as a warning even without any mention of living or dying. A possibility exists that, in order to match the lip movement of the characters in the movie and the time of the dialogue, the language had to be shortened, often leaving out key parts of the sentence. It is known that the Atlantean lines in the movie were ad-libbed afterwards.

In this example the sentences seem to be better connected, and the particle is rendered as almost &quot;but, yet&quot;. It is difficult to reconcile the two, however.

===Nouns===
Atlantean has seven cases for nouns, five for pronouns and two for numbers.

====Grammatical cases====
Notes:
====Other suffixes====
Nouns are marked as plural with the suffix &quot;-en&quot;. Case suffixes never precede the &quot;-en&quot; plural suffix. &quot;-Mok&quot; occurs after it.

===Pronouns===

There are five cases for pronouns.

====Grammatical cases====
Notes:
===Verbs===
Verbs are inflected with two suffixes, one for tense/aspect and the next for person/number.

====Tense/aspect suffixes====
&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
OBLG:obligatory mood
POSB:possible
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
====Mood and Voice suffixes====

<doc id="479575" wikidata="Q416365" url="?curid=479575" title="Calcium silicate">
<text>Calcium silicate can refer to several silicates of calcium including:
*2CaO·SiO2, larnite (Ca2SiO4)
*3CaO·SiO2, alite or (Ca3SiO5)
*3CaO·2SiO2, (Ca3Si2O7)
*CaO·SiO2, wollastonite (CaSiO3). 
This article focuses on Ca2SiO4, also known as calcium orthosilicate. It is also referred to by the shortened trade name Cal-Sil or Calsil. All calcium silicates are white free-flowing powders. They are components of important structural materials because they are strong, cheap, and nontoxic.

==Production and occurrence==
Calcium silicates are produced by treating calcium oxide and silica in various ratios. Their formation is relevant to Portland cement.

Calcium silicate is a byproduct of the Pidgeon process, a major route to magnesium metal. The process converts a mixture of magnesium and calcium oxides as represented by the following simplified equation:
The calcium oxide combines with silicon as the oxygen scavenger, yielding the very stable calcium silicate and releasing volatile (at high temperatures) magnesium metal.

Via the carbonate–silicate cycle, carbonate rocks convert into silicate rocks by metamorphism and volcanism and silicate rocks convert to carbonates by weathering and sedimentation.

The production of sulfuric acid from anhydrous calcium sulfate produces calcium silicates. Upon being mixed with shale or marl, and roasted at 1400 °C, the sulfate liberates sulfur dioxide gas, a precursor to sulfuric acid. The resulting calcium silicate is used in cement clinker production.

==Structure==

As verified by X-ray crystallography, calcium silicate is a dense solid consisting of tetrahedral orthosilicate (SiO44-) units linked to Ca2+ via Si-O-Ca bridges. There are two calcium sites. One is seven coordinate and the other is eight coordinate.

==Use==
===As a component of cement===
Calcium silicates are the major ingredients in Portland cements.

===High-temperature insulation===

Calcium silicate is commonly used as a safe alternative to asbestos for high-temperature insulation materials. Industrial-grade piping and equipment insulation is often fabricated from calcium silicate. Its fabrication is a routine part of the curriculum for insulation apprentices. Calcium silicate competes in these realms against rockwool and proprietary insulation solids, such as perlite mixture and vermiculite bonded with sodium silicate. Although it is popularly considered an asbestos substitute, early uses of calcium silicate for insulation still made use of asbestos fibers.

===Passive fire protection===

It is used in passive fire protection and fireproofing as calcium silicate brick or in roof tiles. It is one of the most successful materials in fireproofing in Europe because of regulations and fire safety guidelines for commercial and residential building codes. Where North Americans use spray fireproofing plasters, Europeans are more likely to use cladding made of calcium silicate. High-performance calcium-silicate boards retain their excellent dimensional stability even in damp and humid conditions and can be installed at an early stage in the construction program, before wet trades are completed and the building is weather-tight. For sub-standard products, silicone-treated sheets are available to fabricators to mitigate potential harm from high humidity or general presence of water. Fabricators and installers of calcium silicate in passive fire protection often also install firestops.

While the best possible reaction to fire classifications are A1 (construction applications) and A1Fl (flooring applications) respectively, both of which mean &quot;non-combustible&quot; according to EN 13501-1: 2007, as classified by a notified laboratory in Europe, some calcium-silicate boards only come with fire classification of A2 (limited combustibility) or even lower classifications (or no classification), if they are tested at all.

===Acid mine drainage remediation===
Calcium silicate, also known as slag, is produced when molten iron is made from iron ore, silicon dioxide and calcium carbonate in a blast furnace. When this material is processed into a highly refined, re-purposed calcium silicate aggregate, it is used in the remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD) on active and passive mine sites. 
Calcium silicate neutralizes active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the bulk solution, thereby increasing pH. As its silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the bulk solution to play other important roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. As opposed to limestone (a popular remediation material), calcium silicate effectively precipitates heavy metals and does not armor over, prolonging its effectiveness in AMD systems.

===As a product of sealants===
It is used as a sealant in roads or on the shells of fresh eggs: when sodium silicate is applied as a sealant to cured concrete or egg shells, it chemically reacts with calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate to form calcium silicate hydrate, sealing micropores with a relatively impermeable material.

===Agriculture===
Calcium silicate is often used in agriculture as a plant available source of silicon. It is &quot;applied extensively to Everglades mucks and associated sands planted to sugarcane and rice&quot; 

===Other===
Calcium silicate is used as an anticaking agent in food preparation, including table salt and as an antacid. It is approved by the United Nations&#x27; FAO and WHO bodies as a safe food additive in a large variety of products. It has the E number reference E552.

<text>Beni Suef () is the capital city of the Beni Suef Governorate in Egypt. The city is the location of Beni Suef University. An important agricultural trade centre on the west bank of the Nile River, the city is located 110 km (70 miles) south of Cairo.

== Etymology ==
The modern name of the town is a corruption of its original name &quot;Manfiswayh&quot; (), which itself comes from a Coptic toponymic construction ⲡ-ⲙⲁ-ⲛ-... (&quot;the place of...&quot;); however, its exact etymology is unknown.

== History ==
From the early Pharaonic era to the Roman period, the area was home to the city of Heracleopolis, 10 miles west of the modern city. which also served as the capital of Lower and Middle Egypt during the 9th and 10th dynasties. The modern city rose to prominence during the Middle Ages, when it was renowned for its linen manufacturing, which continues to the present day through the city&#x27;s carpet making and cotton spinning industries. Beni Suef became the chief town of the second province of Upper Egypt during the reign of Muhammad Ali in the 19th century.

== Geography ==

The total area of the governorate is 1,954 square kilometers, and it is divided into six governorates. It is bordered to the north by Giza governorate and Helwan, to the northeast by Suez, to the east by the Red Sea governorate, to the west by Fayoum governorate, and to the south by Minya governorate. This region connects the north of Egypt to the south, and the east to the west, and this identity of centrality has formed the population, civilization, and economic characters of the region.

<text>Route 3 is 92 kilometres long and goes from Route 170 in St. Stephen to Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) at Longs Creek, near Fredericton.

From St. Stephen, Route 3 goes north along the west bank of Dennis Stream, through the community of Moores Mills. The road turns northeast through Lawrence Station and mostly uninhabited land to meet Route 4 near York Mills. From there, Route 3 continues in a northeasterly direction through Harvey Station, then turns north to the Trans-Canada Highway at Longs Creek.

There have been no major changes or realignments to Route 3 since the 1950s.

<doc id="479587" wikidata="Q507306" url="?curid=479587" title="Nasdaq-100">
<text>The Nasdaq-100 (^NDX) is a stock market index made up of equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. The stocks&#x27; weights in the index are based on their market capitalizations, with certain rules capping the influence of the largest components. It is limited to companies from a single exchange, and it does not have any financial companies. The financial companies are in a separate index, the Nasdaq Financial-100.

==History==
The Nasdaq-100 was launched on January 31, 1985, by the Nasdaq. It created two indices: the Nasdaq-100, which consists of Industrial, Technology, Retail, Telecommunication, Biotechnology, Health Care, Transportation, Media and Service companies, and the Nasdaq Financial-100, which consists of banking companies, insurance firms, brokerage firms, and Mortgage loan companies.

The base price of the index was initially set at 250, but when it closed near 800 on December 31, 1993, the base was reset at 125 the following trading day, leaving the halved Nasdaq-100 price below that of the more commonly known Nasdaq Composite. The first annual adjustments were made in 1993 in advance of options on the index that would trade at the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1994. Foreign companies were first admitted to the Nasdaq-100 in January 1998, but had higher standards to meet before they could be added. Those standards were relaxed in 2002, while standards for domestic firms were raised, ensuring that all companies met the same standards.

==Investing in the Nasdaq-100==
The Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund sponsored and overseen since March 21, 2007, by Invesco, trades under the ticker . It was formerly called Nasdaq-100 Trust Series 1. On December 1, 2004, it was moved from the American Stock Exchange, where it had the symbol QQQ, to the Nasdaq, and given the new ticker symbol QQQQ, sometimes called the &quot;quad Qs&quot; by traders. On March 23, 2011, Nasdaq changed its symbol back to QQQ. Retail buy and hold investors might prefer to purchase Invesco&#x27;s similar Nasdaq: QQQM, or &quot;QQQ Mini&quot; which has a lower fee structure, but lacks the liquidity that high-frequency traders need in the traditional QQQ product.

QQQ is one of the most actively traded exchange-traded funds in the United States.

The Nasdaq-100 is often abbreviated as NDX, NDQ, NAS100 or US100 in the derivatives markets. Its corresponding futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The regular futures are denoted by the Reuters Instrument Code ND, and the smaller &quot;E-mini&quot; version uses the code NQ. Both are among the most heavily traded futures at the exchange.

==Performance==
===Price history and milestones===
The index set highs above the 4,700 level at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, but fell 78% during the stock market downturn of 2002.

After a gradual 5-year recovery to an intraday high of 2,239.51 on October 31, 2007, the highest reached since February 16, 2002, the index corrected below the 2,000 level in early 2008 amid the late-2000s recession, the United States housing bubble and the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Panic focusing on the failure of the investment banking industry culminated in a loss of more than 10% on September 29, 2008, subsequently plunging the index firmly into a bear market. The Nasdaq-100, with much of the broader market, experienced a limit down open on October 24 and reached a 6-year intraday low of 1,018 on November 20, 2008.

Amid quantitative easing (QE) from the Federal Reserve and optimism that the financial crisis was ending, the index embarked on a volatile four-year climb higher, closing above 3,000 on May 15, 2013, for the first time since November 15, 2000. By October 18, 2013, with GOOG passing $1,000 per share for the first time, the index had made a closing high of 3,353.88 and intraday high of 3,355.63, its highest levels since the 2000 United States elections and more than triple the 2008 low.

===Record values===
===List of 1000-point milestones by number of trading days===

===Annual returns===
The following table shows the annual development of the Nasdaq-100 since 1985.
=== Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF Performance ===
The Invesco QQQ ETF has been averaging an annual return rate of 10.09% since its inception back in March 1999. A $1,000 invested in QQQ January 2015 was worth a total of $5,431.98 10 years later at January 18, 2025, assuming the dividends were reinvested with DRIP. That&#x27;s an annual return rate of 18.44% with a total return of 443.20%.

== Selection criteria ==
The Nasdaq has refined a series of stringent standards which companies must meet to be indexed. Those standards include:
* Being listed exclusively on Nasdaq in either the Global Select or Global Market tiers.
* Being publicly offered on an established American market for at least three months.
* Having average daily volume of 200,000 shares.
* Being current in regards to quarterly and annual reports.
* Not being in bankruptcy proceedings.

Additionally, since 2014, companies with multiple classes of stock are allowed to have multiple classes included in the index, provided they meet Nasdaq&#x27;s criteria. Prior to 2014, companies were limited to one class of stock in the index (usually the one with the larger market capitalization).

===Yearly rebalancing and re-ranking===
While the composition of the Nasdaq-100 changes in the case of delisting (such as transferring to another exchange, mergers and acquisitions, or declaring bankruptcy, and in a few cases, being delisted by Nasdaq for failing to meet listing requirements), the index is reconstituted once a year, in December, when Nasdaq reviews its components, compares them with those not in the index, re-ranks all eligible companies and makes the appropriate adjustments.

As of June 2024, all companies are ranked by the size of their market values as of the last trading day of November.

Prior to June 2024, there were two tools the Nasdaq used to determine the market values of companies for the annual review:
* Share Prices as of the last trading day in October.
* Publicly announced share totals as of the last trading day of November.

To determine the new composition of the index: The top 75 components that meet Nasdaq&#x27;s standards are automatically included in the index as of the end of the third Friday in December. Those components that are in the top 100 of all eligible companies at the annual review are retained in the index. Those ranked 101 to 125 are retained, provided that they were in the top 100 of the previous year&#x27;s annual review. If they fail to move into the top 100 in the following year&#x27;s review, they are dropped. Those not ranked in the top 125 are dropped regardless of the previous year&#x27;s rank.

The index also drops a company if, at the end of two consecutive months, it fails to have an index weighting of at least one-tenth of a percent. This can occur at any time. Companies that are dropped are replaced by those with the largest market value that are not already in the index. Anticipation of these changes can lead to changes in the stock prices of affected companies.

The index publicly announces all changes, regardless of when they occur, via press releases at least five business days before the change takes place. The 2018 results of the re-ranking and rebalancing were announced on December 14, with the changes effective the morning of December 24, coinciding with the expiration of options on December 21.

==Differences from Nasdaq Composite index==
The Nasdaq-100 is frequently confused with the Nasdaq Composite Index. The latter index (often referred to simply as &quot;The Nasdaq&quot;) includes the stock of every company that is listed on Nasdaq (more than 3,000 altogether).

The Nasdaq-100 is a modified capitalization-weighted index. This particular methodology was created in 1998 in advance of the creation of the Nasdaq-100 Index Trust, which holds portions of all Nasdaq-100 firms. The new methodology allowed Nasdaq to reduce the influence of the largest companies and to allow for more diversification. However, the weights of the stocks were not changed after that, which led to more problems. In May 2011, Nasdaq did a major rebalance of the index to bring it closer to market-cap weighting.

The index is rebalanced quarterly only if:
* One company is worth 24% of the index
* Companies with a weighting of at least 4.5% make up 48% or more of the index

The index is rebalanced annually, after the quarterly rebalancing, only if:
* One company is worth 15% of the index
* The five largest companies by market capitalizations have weights of 40% or more of the index

==Differences from other indices==
In addition to its almost complete lack of financial companies, the Nasdaq-100 includes seven companies incorporated outside the United States. Although the S&amp;P 500 Index includes non-U.S. companies, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never included foreign companies.

As of June 2024, the index&#x27;s seven companies incorporated in foreign countries are as follows:
* Cayman Islands (headquartered in Ireland, previously China) - PDD Holdings
* Ireland - Linde plc
* The Netherlands - ASML Holding, NXP Semiconductors
* United Kingdom - Arm Holdings, AstraZeneca, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners

Additionally, the Nasdaq-100 is also the only index of the three that has a regularly scheduled re-ranking of its index each year (in December), ensuring that the largest non-financial companies on Nasdaq are accurately included.

==Related indices==
In 2006, Nasdaq created a &quot;farm team&quot; index, the Nasdaq Q-50, representing the next fifty stocks in line to enter the Nasdaq-100. With some exceptions, most stocks that are added to the index come up through the Q-50. In 2011, Nasdaq created the NASDAQ-500 to track the 500 largest stocks on Nasdaq, and the Nasdaq-400, tracking those stocks not included in the Nasdaq-100.

Nasdaq has also divided the 100 into two distinct sub-indices; the Nasdaq-100 Tech follows those components who service the tech sector, and the Nasdaq-100 Ex-Tech, which follows those components that are not considered tech companies. The latter index includes noted e-commerce companies Amazon.com and eBay, which are classified as retailers.

==Components==

&quot;This table is current as of the open of trading on December 23, 2024. An up-to-date list is available in the External links section.&quot;
===Historical components===
As of December 2024, 518 companies have been components of the index. Of these, only four, Apple, Costco (through its merger in 1993 with Price Club, with Costco, as a separate entity, not becoming a component until at least 1989), Intel and PACCAR, have been components, continuously, since the first dissemination of the index in 1985. Two other current components, KLA Corporation and Micron Technology, were also components when the index started, but have been removed from the index over time for various reasons.

<text>Fresh Cream is the debut studio album by the British rock band Cream, consisting of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker.
==Songs and recording==
Almost as soon as Cream were formed in July 1966, they entered Rayrik Studios at Chalk Farm, London, to begin work on their debut single and album with Robert Stigwood producing and John Timperley as engineer. Clapton later noted that the budget was minuscule, working with four track machines and basically running each song a few times through until they got a satisfactory take, with minimal overdubbing afterward. The first sessions at Rayrik on August 3 produced the outtakes &quot;Coffee Song&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Feel&quot; and &quot;Beauty Queen&quot;, followed later in the month by the group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;, a music hall influenced piece designed to showcase the group&#x27;s stylistic versatility, but which was received with puzzlement upon its October release by fans expecting a blues-oriented sound. 

After the band moved to Ryemuse Studios (now known as Mayfair), the bulk of the album was recorded between September and November, neatly divided between old blues covers (&quot;Spoonful&quot;, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Squirrel&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; And Tumblin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot;, &quot;Four Until Late&quot;) and original material penned by bassist Jack Bruce, with two contributions by Ginger Baker (&quot;Sweet Wine&quot; and his groundbreaking extended drum solo &quot;Toad&quot;) and two by Bruce&#x27;s first wife Janet Godfrey, who co-wrote &quot;Sleepy Time Time&quot; with Jack and &quot;Sweet Wine&quot; with Ginger. A session in September also produced the single &quot;I Feel Free&quot; (included on the US version of the album), the first product of the songwriting team of Jack Bruce and bohemian poet Pete Brown which proved a more typical representation of their sound than &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;; released on the same day as the album, it climbed to No. 11 in the UK charts. 

Bruce later said that the opening song &quot;N.S.U.&quot; was written for the band&#x27;s first rehearsal. &quot;It was like an early punk song... the title meant &quot;non-specific urethritis. It didn&#x27;t mean an NSU Quickly – which was one of those little 1960s mopeds. I used to say it was about a member of the band who had this venereal disease. I can&#x27;t tell you which one... except he played guitar.&quot; The mellow pop of &quot;Dreaming&quot; showcased Bruce&#x27;s ghostly falsetto vocal style, which was also used on &quot;I Feel Free&quot; and would become more prominent on later releases. Clapton&#x27;s lengthy, swirling solos on &quot;Sweet Wine&quot; and &quot;Spoonful&quot; pointed toward psychedelia and heavy metal, with Clapton employing much echo, fuzz and feedback, which had been directly inspired by his first meeting with Jimi Hendrix on October 1. Overall, the group&#x27;s fusion of blues with hard rock and improvisational jazz on this record proved seminal on the development of rock music from that point forward.

==Release==
&quot;Fresh Cream&quot; was released in the UK on 9 December 1966, as the first LP on the Reaction Records label, owned by producer Robert Stigwood. It was released in both mono and stereo versions, at the same time as the release of the single &quot;I Feel Free&quot;. Interest in the supergroup&#x27;s first album was intense, and it peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Over two years later, around the time of the band&#x27;s final album &quot;Goodbye&quot; in February 1969, the album saw another surge in the charts that placed it as high as No. 7. The album was released in a slightly different form in January 1967 by Atco Records in the US, also in mono and stereo versions, where it peaked at No. 39.

The mono versions went out of print not long after release, and for many years only the stereo recordings were available. The UK mono album was reissued on CD for the first time in Japan, by Universal Music, in late 2013 as part of a deluxe SHM-CD and SHM-SACD sets (both editions also contain the UK stereo counterpart).

In January 2017, the album was again reissued, by Polydor, in a 4-CD box-set containing mono and stereo versions of the original UK and US release along with singles and B-sides.

==Reception and legacy==

Upon release, critical reaction in the UK was largely positive. While &quot;Melody Maker&quot; opened its review opining &quot;not quite as fresh as it could have been&quot;, they said &quot;it&#x27;s still a great record. Clapton, Baker and Bruce, working like trojans to construct exciting, free, wild music of life, love and soul&quot;, concluding sensational things to come from the group. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; noted &quot;their style on this LP is a very mellow and relaxed sort of music, which oozes confidence...sort of progressive British Rhythm and Blues&quot;. &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; claimed &quot;it&#x27;s good, although not as good, one feels, as it might have been, not enough Eric Clapton for one thing&quot; before picking &quot;Dreaming&quot; as the best track.

One person not happy with the album was Clapton himself, who felt its sound was already outdated. In an interview not long after the album&#x27;s release, he stated &quot;it could have been better. We were working on it so long ago, and we have greatly improved since then. I&#x27;m also not completely happy with the production&quot;. 

Retrospectively, &quot;Uncut&quot; describes the songs as &quot;all about playing in a band and relaxing, the joy of being young, and they walk it like they talk it, being jumping-off points for wonderful spur-of-the moment improvisations&quot;. Writing for the BBC, Sid Smith notes that &quot;blues, pop and rock magically starts to coalesce to create something brand new&quot;. Michael Galluci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; concluded the album &quot;helped spur a bigger, louder and heavier way of playing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll...the amount of power the band manages to generate on this album is remarkable. It&#x27;s safe to assume groups like Led Zeppelin and The Who would never have traveled in a similar direction without Cream leading the way.&quot; Similarly, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic opined that the album was &quot;instrumental in the birth of heavy metal and jam rock&quot;.

In 2012, the album was ranked number 102 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of all time (the highest-ranking album by Cream on the list), calling it &quot;tight and concise, a blueprint for the band&#x27;s onstage jams&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Original UK release===


===Original U.S. version===

===Later U.S. release===
Original reissues in the U.S. on RSO/Polydor use the same track listing as the original UK edition given above in which &quot;I Feel Free&quot; is replaced with &quot;Spoonful&quot; on Side 1. Polydor&#x27;s original CD release from the 1980s combines the UK and US track lists, but also includes &quot;The Coffee Song&quot; and &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;, which were removed from subsequent CD releases starting in the 1990s.

===Scandinavian release===

An edition released originally only in Scandinavia was a 12-track release. It had the same ten tracks as the UK version, plus added two tracks: &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot;, written by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, and &quot;The Coffee Song&quot;, written by Tony Colton and Ray Smith. Both vinyl and cover were made in Germany and exported to the Swedish market only – the German original had the same 10 tracks as the UK release. The group didn&#x27;t want &quot;Coffee Song&quot; to be issued at all, but a mono version was mixed and coupled with &quot;Wrapping Paper&quot; as a single. There were no plans at this stage to release it in stereo, so for the Swedish issue a crude stereo mix was used. This was made during the sessions in early August 1966 for instructive purpose – the whole track as basic mono is mixed far right and a solo guitar overdub far left. Never intended for release, this mix was soon lost, and for later stereo issues a new one was made.

The front cover and record no. (623 031) are the same as the German issue, but three different back covers exist. The first listed the correct 12 tracks, the second listed 10 tracks, and a third had the 12-track listing glued over the 10-track listing.

This version of &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; was also released by Polydor (2384 067) in the UK in 1974 under the title &quot;Cream&quot;.

This version of &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; was released by RSO (2658 142) &amp; Polydor (2658 142) in Germany during 1981 as a boxset under the title &quot;Cream&quot;.

<text>iPlanet was a product brand that was used jointly by Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications Corporation when delivering software and services as part of a non-exclusive cross marketing deal that was also known as &quot;A Sun|Netscape Alliance&quot;.

==History==
After AOL merged with Netscape, technology analysts speculated that AOL&#x27;s major interest was the netscape.com website (specifically the millions of registered users thereof ), and to a lesser extent the Netscape Communicator suite, which some considered would be used to replace the Internet Explorer browser which AOL licensed from Microsoft and included as part of their software suite.

AOL entered into an agreement with systems and software company Sun Microsystems whereby engineers from both companies would work together on software development, marketing, sales, installation and support. Part of the deal was that Sun agreed to pay Netscape a fixed amount for each year of the deal regardless of whether any software was actually sold by the alliance.

The iPlanet brand was already owned by Sun following the acquisition of i-Planet, Inc. in October 1998 (i-Planet was founded just two years before in January 1996).

In 2001, the three year alliance came to an end, at which point, under the terms of the deal, both AOL and Sun retained equal rights to the code that had been jointly developed. Toward the end of August 2001 many of the remaining Netscape employees were either laid off or transferred to Sun (mostly at its campuses in Santa Clara, California and Bangalore). During the period of the alliance, Netscape had hired very few people, most staff coming under the Sun umbrella.

AOL had continued to market the directory and certificate server products under the Netscape brand. But in 2004 AOL sold the directory and certificate server products to Red Hat, which open-sourced them and integrated both into its Red Hat Enterprise Server product portfolio (Red Hat Directory Server and Certificate System).

Most of the other iPlanet products were moved to the Sun ONE brand and then the Sun Java System brand.

After the Oracle acquisition of Sun, some of the former iPlanet products returned to be sold under the iPlanet brand, specifically Oracle iPlanet Web Server and Oracle iPlanet Web Proxy Server.

==Products==
The suite of iPlanet offerings included:
* iPlanet Application Server (a Java EE application server system, based on the Netscape Application Server and NetDynamics Application Server)
* iPlanet Calendar Server
* iPlanet Directory Server (an LDAP server), renamed to Sun Java System Directory Server
* iPlanet Instant Messaging Server
* iPlanet Messaging Server (a SMTP, IMAP, POP3 and webmail mail server)
* iPlanet Meta Directory
* iPlanet Portal Search (formerly Netscape Compass)
* iPlanet Portal Server
* iPlanet Web Server (an HTTP and HTTPS web server), renamed to Sun Java System Web Server
* iPlanet Web Proxy Server, renamed to Sun Java System Web Proxy Server

The suite also included a number of server-side infrastructure components, including distributed event management and tools for managing large populations of iPlanet server instances.

Additionally, iPlanet sold &quot;iPlanet E-Commerce Applications&quot;, a suite of software tools intended for building e-commerce websites:

* iPlanet BillerXpert (for handling billing and related financial processing activities)
* iPlanet BuyerXpert (for business-to-business procurement software)
* iPlanet ECXpert
* iPlanet MerchantXpert
* iPlanet SellerXpert (for implementing b2b and b2c sales websites)
* iPlanet TradingXpert
* Netscape PublishingXpert

<doc id="479608" wikidata="Q729978" url="?curid=479608" title="Mediolanum">
<text>Mediolanum, the ancient city where Milan now stands, was originally an Insubrian city, but afterwards became an important Roman city in Northern Italy. 

The city was settled by a Celtic tribe belonging to the Insubres group and belonging to the Golasecca culture under the name Medhelanon around 590 BC, conquered by the Romans in 222 BC, who Latinized the name of the city into Mediolanum, and developed into a key centre of Western Christianity and informal capital of the Western Roman Empire. It declined under the ravages of the Gothic War, its capture by the Lombards in 569, and their decision to make Ticinum the capital of their Kingdom of Italy.

During the Principate the population was 40,000 in AD 200; when the city became capital of the Western Roman Empire under emperor Maximian (r. 286–305), the population rose to 100,000 people and thus Milan became one of the largest cities in Roman Italy.

==History==


The city was settled by a Celtic tribe belonging to the Insubres group and belonging to the Golasecca culture around 590 BC under the name Medhelanon According to the legend reported by Livy, the Gaulish king Ambicatus sent his nephew Bellovesus into northern Italy at the head of a party drawn from various Gaulish tribes; this Bellovesus was said to have founded Mediolanum (in the time of Tarquinius Priscus, according to this legend).
The Romans, led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, fought the Insubres and captured the city in 222 BC; the chief of the Insubres submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the city. They eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new province Cisalpine Gaul – &quot;Gaul this side of the Alps&quot; – and may have given the site its Latinized Celtic name: in Gaulish &quot;*medio –&quot; meant &quot;middle, center&quot; and the name element &quot;-lanon&quot; is the Celtic equivalent of Latin &quot;-planum&quot; &quot;plain&quot;, thus &quot;*Mediolanon&quot; (Latinized as &quot;Mediolānum&quot;) meant &quot;(settlement) in the midst of the plain.&quot;

Mediolanum was important for its location as a hub in the road network of northern Italy. Polybius describes the country as abounding in wine, and every kind of grain, and in fine wool. Herds of swine, both for public and private supply, were bred in its forests, and the people were well known for their generosity.

During the Augustan age Mediolanum was famous for its schools; it possessed a theater and an amphitheatre (129.5 X 109.3 m). A large stone wall encircled the city in Caesar&#x27;s time, and later was expanded in the late third century AD, by Maximian. Mediolanum was made the seat of the prefect of Liguria (&quot;Praefectus Liguriae&quot;) by Hadrian, and Constantine made it the seat of the vicar of Italy (&quot;Vicarius Italiae&quot;). In the third century Mediolanum possessed a mint, a &quot;horreum&quot; and imperial mausoleum. In 259, Roman legions under the command of Emperor Gallienus soundly defeated the Alemanni in the Battle of Mediolanum.

In 286, Diocletian moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum. He chose to reside at Nicomedia in the Eastern Empire, leaving his colleague Maximian at Mediolanum. Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large circus (470 x 85 metres), the &quot;thermae&quot; or Baths of Hercules, a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain. Maximian increased the city area surrounded by a new, larger stone wall (about 4.5 km long) encompassing an area of 375 acres with many 24-sided towers. The monumental area had twin towers; one that was included in the convent of San Maurizio Maggiore remains 16,60 m high.

It was from Mediolanum that the Emperor Constantine issued what is now known as the Edict of Milan in AD 313, granting tolerance to all religions within the Empire, thus paving the way for Christianity to become the dominant religion of the Empire. Constantine was in Mediolanum to celebrate the wedding of his sister to the Eastern Emperor, Licinius. There were Christian communities in Mediolanum, which contributed its share of martyrs during the persecutions, but the first bishop of Milan who has a firm historical presence is Merocles, who was at the Council of Rome of 313. In the mid-fourth century, the Arian controversy divided the Christians of Mediolanum; Constantius supported Arian bishops and at times there were rival bishops. Auxentius of Milan (died 374) was a respected Arian theologian. During the reign of Valentinian II, bishop Ambrose of Milan prevented the dedication of a basilica to Arian worship.

The city also possessed a number of basilicas, added in the late fourth century AD. These are San Simpliciano, San Nazaro, San Lorenzo and the chapel of San Vittore, located in the basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio. In general, the Late Empire encouraged the development of the applied arts in Mediolanum, with ivory and silver work being common in public building projects. In the crypt of the Duomo survive ruins of the ancient church of Saint Tecla and the baptistry where St. Augustine of Hippo was baptized.

In 402, the city was besieged by the Goths and the imperial residence was moved to Ravenna. In 452, it was besieged again by Attila, but the real break with its imperial past came in 538, during the Gothic War, when Mediolanum was laid to waste by Uraia, a nephew of Vitiges, King of the Goths, with great loss of life. The Lombards took Ticinum as their capital (renaming it &#x27;Papia&#x27;, hence the modern Pavia), and Early Medieval Milan was left to be governed by its archbishops.

== Detailed map of Mediolanum ==
==Extant structures==
Some of the monuments of the Roman Mediolanum still to be seen in Milan:

*crypt of San Giovanni in Conca
* a bit of the &quot;moenia&quot; and some remnants of pavements in piazza Missori and in the namesake station of Milan Metro.

<text>The governor of Tasmania is the representative in the Australian state of Tasmania of the monarch, currently King Charles III. The incumbent governor is Barbara Baker, who was appointed in June 2021. The official residence of the governor is Government House located at the Queens Domain in Hobart. The governor&#x27;s primary task is to perform the sovereign&#x27;s constitutional duties on their behalf.

As with the other state governors, the governor performs similar constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as the governor-general of Australia does at the national level. The position has its origins in the positions of commandant and lieutenant-governor in the colonial administration of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The territory was separated from the Colony of New South Wales in 1825 and the title &quot;governor&quot; was used from 1855, the same year in which it adopted its current name. In accordance with the conventions of the Westminster system of parliamentary government, the governor now almost always acts on the advice of the head of the elected government, the premier of Tasmania.

Tasmania retained British-born governors longer than most other states. The first Australian-born governor was Sir Stanley Burbury (appointed 1973) and the first Tasmanian-born governor was Sir Guy Green (appointed 1995). Since Burbury, all Tasmanian governors have been Australian-born, except for Peter Underwood who was born in Britain but emigrated to Australia when a teenager.

==Titles==
Since December 2014, the incumbent and all future Tasmanian governors have been entitled to be styled as The Honourable for life.

==Governor&#x27;s personal flag==
The personal flag of the governor of Tasmania is the same design as the British blue ensign with the Union Flag at the upper left quarter. On the right side, the state badge of Tasmania, consisting of a white disk with a red lion passant, is surmounted by St. Edward&#x27;s Crown. The flag was adopted in 1977.
If the standard is flying at Government House, on a vehicle or vessel, or at an event, this indicates that the governor is present.
;Past and present flags of the governor
==Divided in two==
Between 1804 and 1813, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land was divided along the 42nd parallel, and the two sections governed as separate lieutenant-governorships under the governor of New South Wales. Collins was the only officially appointed lieutenant-governor—upon his death in 1810, the government in Hobart Town was administered, by the Commandants at Hobart Town (Lord, Murray and Geils). The northern settlement at Port Dalrymple (now George Town) was administered by four commandants until the settlements were merged to form the single colony under the governorship of Thomas Davey in 1813.

<text>The Little Missouri River is a tributary of the Missouri River, long, in the northern Great Plains of the United States. Rising in northeastern Wyoming, in western Crook County about west of Devils Tower, it flows northeastward, across a corner of southeastern Montana, and into South Dakota. In South Dakota, it flows northward through the Badlands into North Dakota, crossing the Little Missouri National Grassland and all three units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. In the north unit of the park, it turns eastward and flows into the Missouri in Dunn County at Lake Sakakawea, where it forms an arm of the reservoir long called Little Missouri Bay and joins the main channel of the Missouri about northeast of Killdeer.

The highly seasonal runoff from badlands and other treeless landscapes along the Little Missouri carries heavy loads of eroded sediment downstream. The sedimentary layers, which extend from the headwaters in Wyoming all the way to the mouth in North Dakota, vary in age, but most of the beds along the river belong to the Bullion Creek and Sentinel Butte formations, both deposited during the Paleocene (about 66 to 56 million years ago). The deposits include siltstone, claystone, sandstone, and lignite coal laid down in a coastal plain during the Laramide orogeny.

<text> is a computer program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 hashes, as described in RFC 1321. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. As with all such hashing algorithms, there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given MD5 hash. However, it is very unlikely that any two non-identical files in the real world will have the same MD5 hash, unless they have been specifically created to have the same hash.

The underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure. Thus, while is well-suited for identifying known files in situations that are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is recommended.

 is used to verify the integrity of files, as virtually any change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to change. Most commonly, is used to verify that a file has not changed as a result of a faulty file transfer, a disk error or non-malicious meddling. The program is included in most Unix-like operating systems or compatibility layers such as Cygwin.

The original C code was written by Ulrich Drepper and extracted from a 2001 release of .

==Examples==
All of the following files are assumed to be in the current directory.

===Create MD5 hash file hash.md5===

$ md5sum filetohashA.txt filetohashB.txt filetohashC.txt &gt; hash.md5
====File produced====
File contains hash and filename pairs:

$ cat hash.md5
595f44fec1e92a71d3e9e77456ba80d1 filetohashA.txt
71f920fa275127a7b60fa4d4d41432a3 filetohashB.txt
43c191bf6d6c3f263a8cd0efd4a058ab filetohashC.txt
Please note:
* There must be two spaces or a space and an asterisk between each value and filename to be compared (the second space indicates text mode, the asterisk binary mode). Otherwise, the following error will result: codice_1. Many programs don&#x27;t distinguish between the two modes, but some utils do.
* The file must be also be UNIX line ending formatted, otherwise this will be seen: codice_2. will convert it quickly if it is DOS/Windows formatted.

===Check MD5===

$ md5sum -c hash.md5
filetohashA.txt: OK
filetohashB.txt: OK
filetohashC.txt: OK
===Check single MD5===

$ echo &#x27;D43F2404CA13E22594E5C8B04D3BBB81 filetohashA.txt&#x27; | md5sum -c
filetohashA.txt: OK

<text>Richard William Prebble (born 7 February 1948) is a former member of the New Zealand Parliament. Initially a member of the Labour Party, he joined the newly formed ACT New Zealand party under Roger Douglas in 1996, becoming its leader from 1996 to 2004.

==Early and personal life==

Prebble was born in Kent, England, to Kenneth Ralph Prebble and Mary Prebble (née Hoad). In 1948, he moved with his parents and older brothers John and Tom Prebble when his father became vicar of Northcote parish in Auckland. His father was an Anglo-Catholic Anglican priest, and a leader in the Charismatic Renewal as archdeacon at St. Pauls, on retirement he and Mary were received into the Roman Catholic Church. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School before becoming a barrister and solicitor in 1971. From 1973 to 1974, he worked overseas in Fiji where he practised law.

Prebble&#x27;s older brother, John Prebble KC, is an emeritus professor in law at Victoria University of Wellington. His younger brother, Mark Prebble was the State Services Commissioner and head of New Zealand&#x27;s public service. John&#x27;s daughter Antonia Prebble is an actor with a number of television roles.

Prebble has been married three times. His first wife was Nancy Cocks, and his second was Doreen Kuper, a former Honorary Consul for the Solomon Islands in New Zealand. His current wife is former Press Gallery radio journalist Ngahuia Wade. Cocks was a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s Fijian branch; in 1975, she was elected to Labour&#x27;s national executive.

==Member of Parliament==





===Opposition===
Prebble was originally a member of the Labour Party and in 1965 he became chairman of the Electorate Committee. At the and elections he was a campaign organiser for Auckland Central MP Norman Douglas. When Douglas announced his retirement Prebble was selected, aged 27, to replace him as Labour&#x27;s candidate in the seat. He was successful in being elected in the Auckland Central electorate at the 1975 election.

Soon after his election, owing mainly to Labour&#x27;s drastic reduction in MPs in their 1975 defeat, he was made Labour&#x27;s spokesman for race relations and the environment. Following the 1978 election, he was given the more prominent portfolio of justice by Labour leader Bill Rowling. From 1978 until 1980, he was additionally the Labour Party&#x27;s junior whip. In 1979, Rowling decided to create a separate shadow cabinet above the caucus. Prebble was given a seat in the shadow cabinet, but was displeased at the change in portfolio allocations in which he lost justice and was instead given immigration, regional development and the environment. As a result, he refused to join the shadow cabinet to protest his allocation of portfolios he did not want. Colleagues described the move as petulant, with Prebble countering by saying &quot;The difference in opposition to being in a shadow cabinet and being a backbencher is only in name. It&#x27;s a shadow rather than a substance.&quot; He resigned as junior whip as well and returned to the backbench until March 1981 when he rejoined the shadow cabinet as Shadow Minister for Social Welfare and Pacific Island Affairs.

On 2 September 1983, Prebble was injured in a head-on car collision whilst he was returning to Wellington after addressing the Taxi Proprietors&#x27; Association conference. He was taken to Dannevirke Hospital and was treated for a concussion and broken pelvis.

Perhaps due to his legal background, Prebble became quickly known for his &quot;tough, aggressive, non-compromising debating style.&quot; From 1975 to 1984, Labour was in opposition, and Ross Meurant recalled that &quot;Sir Rob has often said that when he was in government, the most irritating and damaging of his opponents was Richard Prebble. &#x27;Always at it&#x27; said Sir Rob, &#x27;Always a bother to us. Even if some thought he was mad the way he carried on, we never knew what he was going to come up with next.&#x27;&quot;

===Government===
When the Fourth Labour Government was formed, after the 1984 election, Prebble was elected to the cabinet and was appointed Minister of Transport, Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services, Minister of Railways and Minister of Pacific Island Affairs. He pressed for a Pacific affairs ministerial portfolio to be established, having an interest in the experiences of Pacific Island New Zealanders due to his time working in Fiji and the large concentration of Pacific Islanders living in his constituency.

During the government Prebble aligned himself with Roger Douglas, the controversial Minister of Finance, and was an associate finance minister. Douglas, Prebble and David Caygill were together dubbed &quot;the Treasury Troika&quot;, and were responsible for most of the economic reform undertaken by the Labour government. The &quot;Rogernomics&quot; reforms, which were based on free market economic theory, were unpopular with many traditional Labour supporters. In August 1988, Prebble spoke at a public meeting in Sydenham and was greeted with jeering crowds of Labour supporters who were angry with the reforms and their consequent unemployment. While being interviewed by a television reporter he was hit, mid-sentence, by an egg thrown from the crowd. The egg was thrown by Christopher Owen-Cooper, a former serviceman who served in both World War II and the Korean War, who faced a disorderly behaviour charge. Owen-Cooper was quoted by &quot;The Dominion&quot; newspaper as saying &quot;We&#x27;ve all built up frustration, we&#x27;re sick of what the Government&#x27;s doing. They [politicians] can&#x27;t give us any answers so it was time someone gave them the hurry along.&quot; He was discharged but paid $50 in costs.

Prebble held more portfolios than any other minister in the government as his post of Minister for State Owned Enterprises absorbed almost all the portfolios of government owned operations and assets which were scheduled to be privatised (much to the opposition of the public). As such, Prebble became grossly overworked and colleagues noticed he paid little attention to his appearance with unkempt hair and ragged suits. Other ministers also felt his portfolio took up too much time in cabinet meetings. Lange, in tune with the public mood, was opposed to public asset sales and impeded Prebble&#x27;s efforts in selling them. The disagreement became a very public falling-out when Lange stripped him of the State Owned Enterprises (SOE) portfolio on 4 November 1988. Prebble publicly counterattacked in a television interview that night saying that Lange was acting dictatorially and was in no state to be making decisions. Prebble commented: &quot;He [Lange] said the matter had been eating and gnawing at him and was killing him. I said I didn&#x27;t think this was a proper basis for making policy. Mr Lange said in that case I should resign.&quot; The comments on television by Prebble led to his dismissal from cabinet altogether the following day. Lange stated at a press conference that Prebble had misrepresented the detail and nature of a private conversation between the two.

Prebble returned to the backbenches afterwards. In August 1989, he put himself forward to fill one of two vacant seats in cabinet, but lost a caucus ballot to Annette King. When Lange&#x27;s replacement as Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer held a complete re-election of cabinet in January 1990, Prebble was elected and returned to the frontbench and cabinet. Palmer gave him the SOE portfolio once again and later appointed him Minister of Police as well.

===1990 and 1993 elections===
Prebble retained his Auckland Central seat in the 1990 election. In opposition he was appointed Shadow Minister of State Owned Enterprises, Works, Police and Pacific Island Affairs. In the 1993 election, Prebble lost his seat to Sandra Lee, deputy leader of the new left-wing Alliance party.

In the 1995 New Year Honours, Prebble was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for public services.

After leaving parliament Prebble worked making consultancy deals and moved to Vietnam tendering to build New Zealand&#x27;s first embassy there. In 1996 he also secured a joint-venture deal to restructure Vietnam&#x27;s railway system (which was still using steam engines). He also joined Auckland businessman Malcolm McConnell to create the company McConnell International.

===ACT New Zealand===
New Zealand switched to the mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation electoral system in 1993. Roger Douglas established the ACT New Zealand party, and was joined by Prebble. Initially he did not take an active role in the party and, though frequently invited to speak at ACT functions, he stated in July 1995 that he had no intention of standing for parliament again. However, in March 1996, Douglas stepped down as the new party&#x27;s leader, and Prebble took over beating former Federated Farmers president Owen Jennings for the party leadership.

====1996 election====
In the 1996 election, the first to be held under MMP, ACT won eight seats in Parliament. Prebble won the Wellington Central electorate following a campaign that saw National Party leader and Prime Minister Jim Bolger predict Prebble would win rather than National’s candidate. Under New Zealand&#x27;s MMP rules, a party that falls below the five-percent threshold can still qualify for MMP if it wins at least one electorate seat. Bolger saw ACT as a natural partner either in a coalition or a confidence-and-supply arrangement (a marked turn from Prebble and Douglas&#x27;s roots in Labour), and wanted to ensure ACT would be in the chamber by helping Prebble win Wellington Central. The events were captured in the documentary &quot;Campaign&quot;. In the end, ACT won 6.1 percent of the party vote, enough for it to enter Parliament in any event.

====1999 election====
Prebble lost his Wellington Central seat in the 1999 election, but remained in Parliament as a list MP and leader of ACT.

====2002 election====
Prebble was re-elected as a list MP and leader of ACT in the 2002 election.

===Retirement===
Prebble was replaced as ACT leader by Rodney Hide in 2004, and did not stand in the 2005 election.

He became campaign manager for ACT leading up to the 2014 election with his stated aim to bring 9 ACT MP&#x27;s into Parliament; this did not eventuate however as ACT did not gain any new seats, only retaining Epsom.

In late October 2024, the Sixth National Government appointed Prebble to the Waitangi Tribunal. Labour Member of Parliament Willie Jackson opposed Prebble&#x27;s appointment, citing his alignment with the ACT Party&#x27;s policies towards Māori including the controversial Treaty Principles Bill.

==Personal life==
Prebble now lives in Rotorua and he is a columnist with &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;.

<doc id="479687" wikidata="Q370366" url="?curid=479687" title="Bob cut">
<text>A bob cut, also known as a bob, is a short to medium length haircut for women, in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at approximately jaw level, and no longer than shoulder-length, often with a fringe at the front. The standard bob cut exposes the back of the neck and keeps all of the hair well above the shoulders.

==History==
Historically, women in the West have usually worn their hair long. Some young girls, actresses and a few &quot;advanced&quot; or fashionable women had worn short hair even before World War I, such as French actress Polaire, described in 1910 as having &quot;a shock of short, dark hair&quot;, a cut she adopted in the early 1890s. The style, however, was not considered generally respectable until given impetus by the inconvenience of long hair to girls engaged in war work.

In 1909, Antoni Cierplikowski, called Antoine de Paris, a Polish hairdresser who became the world&#x27;s first celebrity hairdresser, started a fashion for a short bob cut. He said it was inspired by accounts of Joan of Arc. In the 1920s, he introduced the “shingle cut”, which became popular with daring young women—the Bloomsbury set and flappers. Among his clients were world-famous female figures such as Coco Chanel, Queen Marie of Romania, Sarah Bernhardt, Greta Garbo, U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Brigitte Bardot.

English society beauty Lady Diana Cooper wore bobbed hair from childhood through adulthood. It has been said that renowned dancer and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle introduced her &quot;Castle bob&quot; to a receptive American audience in 1915, and by 1920 the style was rapidly becoming fashionable. However, it was artist and illustrator Clara Tice who was the first public person who used it the United States. Popularized by film star Mary Thurman in the early 1920s and by Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks in the mid to late 1920s, it was still seen as a somewhat shocking statement of independence in the young women known as flappers, as older people were used to seeing girls wearing long dresses and heavy Edwardian-style hair. Hairdressers, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, were slow to realise that short styles for women had arrived to stay, and so barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to be shorn of hair that had taken many years to grow.

Although as early as 1922 the fashion correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; was suggesting that bobbed hair was passé, by the mid-1920s the style (in various versions, often worn with a side-parting, curled or waved, and with the hair at the nape of the neck &quot;shingled&quot; short), was the dominant female hairstyle in the Western world. The style was spreading even beyond the West, as women who rejected traditional roles adopted the bob cut as a sign of modernity. Close-fitting cloche hats had also become very popular, and could not be worn with long hair. Well-known bob-wearers were actresses Clara Bow and Joan Crawford, as well as Dutch film star Truus van Aalten.

As the 1930s approached, women started to grow their hair longer, and the sharp lines of the bob were abandoned.

===1960s and beyond===


In the mid 1960s, Vidal Sassoon made it popular again, using the shape of the early bob and making it more stylish in a simpler cut. Its resurgence coincided with the arrival of the &quot;mop top&quot; Beatle cut for men. Those associated with the bob at that time included fashion designers Mary Quant and Jean Muir; actresses Nancy Kwan, Carolyn Jones, Barbara Feldon, Georgina Ward and Amanda Barrie; and singers as diverse as Keely Smith, Cilla Black, Billie Davis, Juliette Gréco, Mireille Mathieu and Beverly Bivens of the American group We Five. Valentina, the transgressively erotic heroine of a surreal Italian comic strip series created by Guido Crepax in 1965, sported an iconic bob inspired by actress Louise Brooks (as well as by Crepax&#x27;s own wife Luisa). The bob cut was also popular with African Americans in the mid-to-late 1960s, reflected in such singing groups as Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes and The Marvelettes.

Many styles and combinations of the &quot;bob&quot; have evolved since. In the late 1980s, Siouxsie Sioux, lead singer of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Corinne Drewery, singer of &quot;Swing Out Sister&quot;, had bob cuts for a short time. Singer Linda Ronstadt sported a very &quot;Louise Brooks&quot; inspired bob on the cover of two Grammy award winning albums in the late 1980s: 1987&#x27;s &quot;Trio&quot; album with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris and her 1989 release &quot;Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind&quot;. She also wears the cut in the video for her duet with James Ingram, &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;. Annie Potts made an appearance in the supernatural comedy film &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; with a bob as she played the character Janine Melnitz. Phoebe Cates&#x27;s character Elizabeth in the 1991 black comedy film &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; got a bob haircut after getting part of her long black hair cut off. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American &quot;Vogue&quot; since 1988, apparently had hers trimmed every day (&quot;Times 2&quot;, 10 July 2006). In the early 1990s Cyndi Lauper had a bob haircut with very unusual colors; soon afterward, the cut became identified with Uma Thurman&#x27;s character of Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The bob went into hibernation, but eventually became popular again. Natalie Portman sported a bob haircut in the 1994 English-language French action-thriller film &quot;Leon: The Professional&quot; for her portrayal of her character Mathilda. T-Boz of TLC also had a bob haircut with very unusual colors that was asymmetrical with bangs. Also, for the first two seasons and the first two episodes of the third season of &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, the character of Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) had a trademark bob haircut. The character of Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino) from Barry Sonnenfeld&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot; also sported a bob. Julianne Moore had a bob in the 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; for her portrayal of Maude Lebowski. Katie Volding, who played Benjamin “Ben” Cooper&#x27;s little sister Angie in the 1999 Disney Channel TV movie &quot;Smart House&quot;, had a bob haircut.

===2000s revival===

In 2006, the bob was adopted by the singer Madonna and, as a move away from boho-chic, by actress Sienna Miller.

In November 2005, Canadian ice dancer Kristina Lenko was asked to join ITV1&#x27;s new series, &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. She went to her stylist in Toronto and told him &quot;Do whatever you like.&quot; He cut Lenko&#x27;s waist-length hair into what is referred to as an A-line bob, where the hair is shorter in the back and gradually longer toward the front, with the longest pieces toward the front of the face. Later, ex–Spice Girl Victoria Beckham decided to cut her own hair into such a style, helping to raise its popularity worldwide with girls asking hairdressers for a &quot;Pob&quot;—Beckham&#x27;s nickname Posh Spice conflated with &quot;bob&quot;.

In 2007, R&amp;B singer Rihanna had a bob haircut in the video for &quot;Umbrella&quot;. She has said that she was inspired by actress Charlize Theron in &quot;Æon Flux&quot;. 
Keira Knightley had a bob in her short TV ad for &quot;Coco Mademoiselle&quot;. Actress Christina Ricci also had a bob for live-action movie version for 60s anime series &quot;Speed Racer&quot; and later. Katie Holmes got a bob cut with bangs in 2007.

Jenny McCarthy is known for a sporting an A-line bob. Bryce Dallas Howard&#x27;s character Claire Dearing sported an A-line Bob in the 2015 film Jurassic World. Kate Bosworth is said to have popularized the bob in 2008. Shoulder-length bobs became popular after being sported by stars such as Heidi Klum and Jessica Alba. A shaggy version of the bob was popularized by Dianna Agron and Kate Mara.

==Types==
* A-line bob: A typical bob cut, with slightly longer hair in front that frames the face, typically curling under the chin.
* Buzz-cut bob: Where it is shoulder-length in the front and close-cropped at the back.
* Chin-length bob: Cut straight to the chin, with or without bangs.
* French bob: Shorter type of bob.

<text>&quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; is a song by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, from their second album, &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; was released as a single in 1999, with two studio recordings — &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; (an Icelandic pun mixing &quot;sleepwalkers&quot; and &quot;sleep angels&quot;) and &quot;Viðrar vel til loftárása&quot; (&quot;good weather for airstrikes&quot;), both from &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; — and two songs recorded live at the Icelandic Opera House located in Reykjavík — &quot;Nýja lagið&quot; (&quot;new song&quot;), which was never recorded in studio, and &quot;Syndir Guðs&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s sins&quot;), from the group&#x27;s first LP, &quot;Von&quot;. The single was the first UK release for the band, issued on Fat Cat Records in 1999. On its release, it was named &quot;Single of the Week&quot; in &quot;NME&quot;. In 2001, it was re-issued, in the United States, on PIAS records. The single is available both on compact disc and 12 inch vinyl, with somewhat different selections of tracks, including &quot;Veröld ný og óð&quot; (&quot;new and old world&quot;).

The music video for &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; was directed by August Jacobsson. The video features the Perlan special-needs theatre group, an Icelandic acting troupe of men and women with Down syndrome. Choreography was by Lára Stefánsdóttir, and the angel outfits were made by Binna &amp; Nína.

<doc id="479692" wikidata="Q7240389" url="?curid=479692" title="Premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories">
<text>The premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories are the heads of the executive governments in the six states and two self-governing territories of Australia. They perform the same function at the state and territory level as the Prime Minister of Australia performs at the national level. The King of Australia and the state governors are the formal repositories of executive power; however, in practice they act only on the advice of state premiers and ministers except in extreme circumstances, such as a constitutional crisis.

==Background==
Each of the Australian states is governed under the Westminster system of parliamentary government. Each state has an elected legislature. Following a general election, the state governor appoints as premier the member of the lower house of the state legislature who can command a simple majority of votes on the floor of the house. The governor is the head of state, and acts only on the advice of the head of government - the premier. The premier must resign the commission to the governor for losing the confidence of the legislative assembly, either because their party is defeated at a general election or losing a vote of confidence in the house. (Premiers may also resign for other reasons, such as losing the confidence of their own party).

The Australian states were founded as British colonies, and executive power was held by a governor (or sometimes a lieutenant-governor) appointed by the British government (see Governors of the Australian states). From the 1820s the power of the governors was gradually transferred to legislative bodies, at first appointed, later partly elected, and finally fully elected. Victoria gained full responsible parliamentary government in 1855, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania in 1856, Queensland in 1859 and Western Australia (owing to its much smaller population) in 1890.

Until the rise of the Australian Labor Party in the 1890s, the Australian colonies did not have formal party systems, although many colonial politicians called themselves Liberals or Conservatives. Ministries were usually formed on the basis of personal or factional loyalties, and rose and fell with great frequency as loyalties changed. Colonial politics were commonly regarded as parochial, corrupt and cynical, and in many cases they were. Victorian Premier James Munro, for example, fled the colony to escape his creditors in 1890, and Queensland Premier Sir Thomas McIlwraith was notoriously corrupt.

The rise of Labor forced the colonies to move towards a two-party system of Labor versus non-Labor, although state politics remained more personalised and less ideological than national politics for many years. The first minority Labor government was formed by Anderson Dawson in Queensland in 1899, and the first majority Labor government was led by James McGowen in New South Wales in 1910. Since about 1910 state politics have followed much the same party pattern as Australian national politics (see Politics of Australia).

Since 1952, every premier of every state has been a member of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, or the National Party of Australia (until 1973, the Liberal Party was known as the Liberal and Country League in South Australia; the Country Liberal Party is the Northern Territory branch of the Liberal and National Parties; and the Liberal National Party has been the Queensland branch of the same two parties since 2008).

Although the legislative powers of the states are defined in the Constitution, the real power of the Australian premiers has been declining steadily ever since Federation in 1901, as the power and responsibility of the national government has expanded at the expense of the states. The most important transfer of power came in 1943, when in the interests of national unity during World War II the states gave up their power to levy their own income taxes to the Commonwealth. Since then the states&#x27; finances have essentially been controlled by the Commonwealth.

===Relations between the premiers and other levels of government===
For many decades, the premiers met with each other and the prime minister at Premiers&#x27; Conferences. From 1992 to 2020, such meetings occurred through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), which also includes the chief ministers of the territories and a representative of local government. Since 2020, the National Cabinet allows meetings between the prime minister, state premiers and chief ministers of the territories, however local government representation has been removed.

On 21 July 2006, South Australian premier Mike Rann was appointed chairman of a new Council for the Australian Federation, a council which aims to improve state-federal ties.

==Timeline==
Between 6 March 2002 (when Mike Rann (Labor) succeeded Rob Kerin (Liberal) as Premier of South Australia) and 23 September 2008, when Colin Barnett succeeded Alan Carpenter as Premier of Western Australia, there were Labor Premiers in all six of the Australian states (and Chief Ministers in both territories); this was only the second time a party or coalition has ever achieved this. A comparable feat was achieved by the Coalition between 26 May 1969 (when the Liberals&#x27; Angus Bethune succeeded Labor&#x27;s Eric Reece as Premier of Tasmania) and 2 June 1970 (when the Liberals&#x27; Steele Hall was succeeded by Labor&#x27;s Don Dunstan as Premier of South Australia).

==Female heads of government==

With the exception of South Australia, every state and territory of Australia has had a female head of government, all but three of whom have represented the Australian Labor Party. They are:
* Australian Capital Territory:
**Rosemary Follett 1989, 19911995 (first territory and first jurisdiction)
**Kate Carnell 19952000
**Katy Gallagher 20112014
* Western Australia:
**Carmen Lawrence 19901993 (first state)
* Victoria:
**Joan Kirner 19901992
**Jacinta Allan 2023present
* Northern Territory:
**Clare Martin 20012007
**Natasha Fyles 20222023
**Eva Lawler 20232024
**Lia Finocchiaro 2024present
* Queensland:
**Anna Bligh 20072012
**Annastacia Palaszczuk 20152023
* New South Wales:
**Kristina Keneally 20092011
**Gladys Berejiklian 20172021
* Tasmania:
**Lara Giddings 20112014

Of the state leaders, all but Palaszczuk succeeded male premiers of their own party who had resigned mid-term; in three cases (Lawrence, Kirner and Keneally), their predecessors&#x27; resignations occurred after losing the support of their parliamentary colleagues; in Allan&#x27;s case, her predecessor, Daniel Andrews, resigned only ten months after being re-elected in November 2022. The governments led by Lawrence, Kirner, Keneally and Giddings were defeated at the subsequent elections.

Anna Bligh, Annastacia Palaszczuk and Gladys Berejiklian are the only women who have received a popular mandate as premier of an Australian state (21 March 2009, 31 January 2015 and 23 March 2019). Palaszczuk is also the only woman to have led a party from Opposition to Government.

Women have also been elected to the almost-equivalent posts of chief ministers of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT). Rosemary Follett (Labor) was elected as the inaugural Chief Minister of the ACT in 1989, nine months before any woman became premier of a state. Kate Carnell (Liberal), and Clare Martin (Labor) also received popular mandates as chief ministers of the ACT and the NT respectively. Clare Martin was the only one of these three women to lead a majority government.

Of all female premiers and chief ministers, only Clare Martin and Annastacia Palaszczuk have gained re-election after successfully completing a term from election to election. Rosemary Follett did win two consecutive elections, but had an interrupted term of service from 5 December 1989 (when a successful motion of no confidence passed by establishing a new government led by Trevor Kaine) to 6 June 1991 (when another motion of no confidence was passed, this time against Trevor Kaine, re-establishing Follett as chief minister).

<doc id="479694" wikidata="Q7933536" url="?curid=479694" title="Willie Sutton">
<text>William Francis Sutton Jr. (June 30, 1901 – November 2, 1980) was an American bank robber. During his forty-year robbery career he stole an estimated $2 million, and he eventually spent more than half of his adult life in prison and escaped three times. For his talent at executing robberies in disguises, he gained two nicknames, &quot;Willie the Actor&quot; and &quot;Slick Willie&quot;. Sutton is also known as the namesake of the so-called Sutton&#x27;s law, although he denied originating it.

==Early life==
Sutton was born into an Irish-American family on June 30, 1901 in Brooklyn, New York to William Francis Sutton Sr., a blacksmith, and Mary Ellen Bowles. His family lived on the corner of Gold and Nassau Streets in the neighborhood of Irishtown, Brooklyn, now called Vinegar Hill. According to his biography, &quot;Where the Money Was&quot;, at the age of three the family relocated to High Street. His mother was, according to the biography, born in Ireland; however, according to the 1910 U.S. Census, she was born in Maryland and her parents were born in Ireland. By 1910, she had given birth to five children, of whom three were still alive. According to the 1910 Census, his maternal grandfather, James Bowles, and his two maternal uncles were also living with the family. Sutton was the fourth of five children, and did not attend school after the 8th grade.

==Career in crime==
Sutton became a criminal at an early age, though throughout his professional criminal career, he did not kill anyone. He was described by Mafioso Donald Frankos as &quot;a little bright-eyed guy, just 5&#x27;7&quot; and always talking, chain-smoking ... cigarettes with Bull Durham tobacco.&quot; Frankos stated also that Sutton &quot;dispensed mounds of legal advice&quot; to any convict willing to listen. Inmates considered Sutton a &quot;wise old head&quot; in the prison population. When incarcerated at &quot;The Tombs&quot; (Manhattan House of Detention) he did not have to worry about assault because Mafia friends protected him. In conversation with Donald Frankos he would sadly reminisce about the 1920s and 1930s when he was most active in robbing banks and would always tell fellow convicts that in his opinion, during the days of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, the criminals were the bloodiest. Gangsters from the time period, and many incarcerated organized crime inmates, enjoyed having Sutton for companionship. He was witty and non-violent. Frankos declared that Sutton made legendary bank thieves Jesse James and John Dillinger seem like amateurs.

Sutton was an accomplished bank robber. He usually carried a pistol or a Thompson submachine gun. &quot;You can&#x27;t rob a bank on charm and personality,&quot; he once observed. In an interview in the Reader&#x27;s Digest published shortly before his death, Sutton was asked if the guns that he used in his robberies were loaded. He responded that he never carried a loaded gun because somebody might get hurt. He stole from the rich and kept it, though public opinion later made him into a type of gentleman thief, like Robin Hood. He allegedly never robbed a bank when a woman screamed or a baby cried.

Sutton was captured and recommitted in June 1931, charged with assault and robbery. He failed to complete his 30-year sentence, however, escaping on December 11, 1932, using a smuggled gun and holding a prison guard hostage. With the guard as leverage, Sutton acquired a 45-ft (13.5 meter) ladder to scale the 30-ft (9 meter) wall of the prison grounds.

On February 15, 1933, Sutton attempted to rob the Corn Exchange Bank and Trust Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He came in disguised as a postman, but an alert passerby foiled the crime. Sutton escaped. On January 15, 1934, he and two companions broke into the same bank through a skylight.

The FBI record observes:
Sutton also conducted a Broadway jewelry store robbery in broad daylight, impersonating a postal telegraph messenger. Sutton&#x27;s other disguises included a police officer, messenger and maintenance man. He usually arrived at banks or stores shortly before they opened for business.
Sutton was apprehended on February 5, 1934, and was sentenced to serve 25 to 50 years in the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for the machine gun robbery of the Corn Exchange Bank. On April 3, 1945, Sutton was one of 12 convicts who escaped the institution through a tunnel. The convicts broke through to the other side during daylight hours, and were spotted immediately by a passing police patrol. The 12 men were forced to quickly flee the scene, with all being quickly apprehended. Sutton was recaptured the same day by Philadelphia police officer Mark Kehoe.

Sentenced to life imprisonment as a fourth time offender, Sutton was transferred to the Philadelphia County Prison, Holmesburg section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On February 10, 1947, Sutton and other prisoners dressed as prison guards carried two ladders across the prison yard to the wall after dark. When the prison&#x27;s searchlights hit him, Sutton yelled, &quot;It&#x27;s all right!&quot; No one stopped him.

On March 20, 1950, Sutton was the eleventh listed of the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, created only a week earlier, on March 14.

During February 1952, Sutton was captured by police after having been recognized on a subway and followed by Arnold Schuster, a 24-year-old Brooklyn clothing salesman and amateur detective. Schuster later appeared on television and described how he had assisted in Sutton&#x27;s apprehension. Albert Anastasia, Mafia boss of the Gambino crime family, disliked Schuster because he was a &quot;rat&quot; and a &quot;squealer.&quot; According to Mafia renegade and first major government informant, Joe Valachi, Anastasia ordered the murder of Schuster, who was then shot dead outside his home on March 9, 1952.

Judge Peter T. Farrell presided over a 1952 trial in which Sutton was convicted of the 1950 robbery of $63,942 (equal to $ presently) from a bank of the Manufacturers Trust Company in Sunnyside, Queens. He received a sentence of 30 to 120 years in Attica State Prison.
While in prison, Sutton wrote &quot;I, Willie Sutton&quot;, a book about his life and career. Co-authored with Quentin Reynolds, the book was published in 1953.

In December of 1969, Farrell ruled that Sutton&#x27;s good behavior, along with his deteriorating health, justified commuting his sentence to time served. At the hearing Sutton responded, &quot;Thank you, your Honor. God bless you,&quot; and wept as he was led out of the court building.

In 1976, Sutton published his second book, &quot;Where the Money Was&quot;, co-authored with journalist Ed Linn.

After his release, Sutton delivered lectures on prison reform and consulted with banks on theft-deterrent techniques. He made a television commercial for New Britain Bank and Trust Company in Connecticut for their credit card with picture identification on it. His lines were, &quot;They call it the &#x27;face card.&#x27; Now when I say I&#x27;m Willie Sutton, people believe me.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Sutton married Louise Leudemann in 1929. She divorced him while he was in jail. Their daughter Jeanie was born the next year. His second wife was Olga Kowalska, whom he married in 1933. His longest period of (legal) employment lasted for 18 months.

A series of decisions by the United States Supreme Court during the 1960s resulted in his release on Christmas Eve, 1969, from Attica State Prison. He was in ill health at the time, suffering from emphysema and in need of an operation on the arteries of his legs.

Sutton died in 1980 at the age of 79; before this, he had spent his last years with his sister in Spring Hill, Florida. He frequented the Spring Hill Restaurant where he kept to himself. After Sutton&#x27;s death, his family arranged a quiet burial in Brooklyn in the family plot.

==&quot;Sutton&#x27;s law&quot;==

A famous apocryphal story is that Sutton was asked by reporter Mitch Ohnstad why he robbed banks. According to Ohnstad, he replied, &quot;Because that&#x27;s where the money is.&quot; The quote evolved into Sutton&#x27;s law, which is often invoked to medical students as a metaphor for emphasizing the most likely diagnosis, rather than wasting time and money investigating every conceivable possibility.

In his autobiography, Sutton denied originating the pithy rejoinder:

However, he also said:

The &quot;Redlands Daily Facts&quot; published the earliest documented example of Sutton&#x27;s law on March 15, 1952 in Redlands, California.

A corollary, the &quot;Willie Sutton rule,&quot; used in management accounting, stipulates that activity-based costing (in which activities are prioritized by necessity, and budgeted accordingly) should be applied where the greatest costs occur, because that is where the greatest savings can be found.

<text>Port Arthur was a city in Northern Ontario, Canada, located on Lake Superior. In January 1970, it amalgamated with Fort William and the townships of Neebing and McIntyre to form the city of Thunder Bay.

Port Arthur had been the district seat of Thunder Bay District. It is historically notable as a temporary (1882–1885) eastern terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). It served as a major transshipment point for lakers that carried cargo to Port Arthur from across the Great Lakes. CPR&#x27;s completion to the east did little to affect the city&#x27;s importance for shipping; the Canadian Northern Railway was constructed to serve the port, and it built numerous grain silos to supply lakers. This rail and grain trade diminished in the latter half of the 20th century.

== History ==
The government of the Province of Canada determined in the late 1850s to begin the exploration and settlement of Canada west of Ontario. With Confederation in 1867, Simon James Dawson was employed by the Canadian Department of Public Works (DPW) to construct a road and route from Thunder Bay on Lake Superior to the Red River Colony (now Manitoba).

DPW&#x27;s depot and settlement on the lake, where it landed and stored its supplies, acquired its first name in May 1870, after a fierce fire. Colonel Garnet Wolseley named the tiny fire-ravaged settlement as Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing, in honor of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (1850–1942), son of Queen Victoria. Prince Arthur was then serving with his regiment in Montreal. In 1871 the Ontario government surveyed the Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing Town Plot, thereby officially confirming the name and opening the land for legal possession. In May 1883 this unwieldy name was changed unilaterally by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) officials in Winnipeg to Port Arthur. The namesake prince did not visit the settlement until May 1890, when he and his entourage briefly stopped there.

The residents of Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing developed the Thunder Bay District&#x27;s first municipality, the Municipality of Shuniah in March 1873. This early form of regional government covered an area that reached from Sibley Peninsula to the United States (US) border. The residents of Prince Arthur dominated Shuniah, which was resented by the few residents of Fort William, Ontario. In 1881, they established their own Municipality of Neebing. They began a long and ultimately successful competition with Port Arthur to secure all the operations of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which moved to Fort William later in the century.

Prospering from the CPR railway construction boom of 1882–1885, Port Arthur was incorporated as a town in March 1884. The CPR erected Thunder Bay&#x27;s and western Canada&#x27;s first terminal grain elevator on the bay in 1883, later leasing it to Joseph Goodwin King.

In the late 19th century, Port Arthur was greatly affected by changes in the economy. The CPR completed its construction along the north shore of Lake Superior and decided to centralize its operations along the lower Kaministiquia River. This abruptly reduced business in Port Arthur. In addition, silver mining had been the mainstay of the economy since the 1870s, but the boom in silver mining ended in October 1890. The U.S. Congress passed the McKinley Tariff, cutting off profitable exports to the US.

The town was in dire economic straits until 1897–1899, when the entrepreneurs William Mackenzie and Donald Mann acquired the Ontario and Rainy River Railway and the Port Arthur, Duluth and Western Railway. They chose Port Arthur as the Lake Superior headquarters for the Canadian Northern Railway. Port Arthur thrived as a transhipment and grain handling port for the CNR after the railway line was opened to Winnipeg, Manitoba in December 1901.

From 1871 onward, Port Arthur was designated as the administrative centre for Thunder Bay District (created 1871 by the Ontario government). A provincial stipendiary magistrate dispensed justice until 1884, when the government created a judicial district and appointed a federal judge to lead the court. The province erected a jail and court house in 1876, and located a Crown Lands Agent, a Crown Timber Agent, and an Inspector of Colonization Roads in the town. The federal Indian Agent was also usually located in the town. A large new courthouse was erected by the province in 1924.
Attempts from 1901 to 1914 to secure manufacturing industries generally came to naught. But the Western Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company, later called the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company or PASCO, was a major industrial employer for many years.

The forest products industry was important to the town&#x27;s economic life. In the 1880s, Herman Finger established the Pigeon River Lumber Company, but dissolved the company and moved his operations to The Pas by 1906. In 1917, two sawmills were added the pulp and paper industry, with the establishment of the Port Arthur Pulp and Paper Company, later a division of Provincial Paper Mills Ltd, and in 1920 the Kaministiquia Pulp and Paper Company at Current River. This was sold in 1922 to the Consolidated Water Power and Paper Company of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.

The absorption of the Canadian Northern Railway into the Canadian National Railways meant the loss of many CNoR facilities. The Canadian Northern route through Port Arthur was downgraded by the new CNR. But western Canadian grain companies preferred to build their large new terminal grain elevators on Thunder Bay rather than on Fort William&#x27;s Kaministiquia River.

Lakehead University was established on a site within the former city of Port Arthur, whose intercity area increasingly became a focus of industrial and commercial activity in the post-World War II period.

Port Arthur became a city in April 1907. The City of Port Arthur ceased to exist at the end of December 1969.

==Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing waterfront district==

In 2006, Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing was adopted as the name for a mix-use waterfront redevelopment district incorporating a marina, parkland and trails, public art, restored heritage buildings, and a future hotel. Structures include the Baggage Building Arts Centre public gallery, a restored circa-1900 building, the Water Garden Pavilion, a skateboard park, running and cycling trails, as well as public art.

==Arms==
In 1963 Port Arthur acquired a new coat of arms from the College of Arms in London. The original crest depicted a wooden fort with wide-open gate with the motto &quot;Gateway to the West.&quot; The new coat of arms, designed by J.P. Brooke-Little, Bluemantle Pursuivant of Arms, featured a heraldic gateway in a framing sun, wavy bars representing water, blue fleurs de lys, a red cross, a lion holding a tree, a moose and a wolf.

<text>Applied Materials, Inc. is an American corporation that supplies equipment, services and software for the manufacture of semiconductor (integrated circuit) chips for electronics, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones, televisions, and solar products. The company also supplies equipment to produce coatings for flexible electronics, packaging and other applications. The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and is the second largest supplier of semiconductor equipment in the world based on revenue behind Dutch company ASML.

==History==
Founded in 1967 by Michael A. McNeilly and others, Applied Materials went public in 1972 on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), a then-recently established stock exchange. In subsequent years, the company diversified, until James C. Morgan became CEO in 1976 and returned the company&#x27;s focus to its core business of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. By 1978, sales increased by 17%.

In 1984, Applied Materials became the first U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturer to open its own technology center in Japan, and the first semiconductor equipment company to operate a service center in China. In 1987, Applied introduced a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) machine called the Precision 5000, which differed from existing machines by incorporating diverse processes into a single machine that had multiple process chambers.

In 1992, the corporation settled a lawsuit with three former employees for an estimated $600,000. The suit complained that the employees were driven out of the company after complaining about the courses Applied Scholastics had been hired to teach there.

In 1993, the Applied Materials&#x27; Precision 5000 was inducted into the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s permanent collection of Information Age technology.

In November 1996, Applied Materials acquired two Israeli companies for an aggregate amount of $285 million: Opal Technologies and Orbot Instruments for $175 million and $110 million in cash, respectively. Orbot produces systems for inspecting patterned silicon wafers for yield enhancement during the semiconductor manufacturing process, as well as systems for inspecting masks used during the patterning process. Opal develops and manufactures high-speed metrology systems used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify critical dimensions during the production of integrated circuits.

In 2000, Etec Systems, Inc. was purchased. On June 27, 2001, Applied Materials acquired Israeli company Oramir Semiconductor Equipment Ltd., a supplier of laser cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers, in a purchase business combination for $21 million in cash.

In January 2008, Applied Materials purchased Baccini, an Italian company and designer of tools used in manufacturing solar cells.

In 2009, Applied Materials opened its Solar Technology Center, the world&#x27;s largest commercial solar energy research and development facility, in Xi&#x27;an, China.

Applied Materials acquired Semitool Inc. in December 2009, and announced its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor in May 2011. Applied Materials then announced a planned merger with Tokyo Electron on September 24, 2013. If it had been approved by government regulators, the proposed combined company, to be called Eteris, would have been the world&#x27;s largest supplier of semiconductor processing equipment, with a total market value of $29 billion. However, on April 27, 2015, Applied Materials announced that its merger with Tokyo Electron has been scrapped due to antitrust concerns and fears of dominating the semiconductor equipment industry.

In 2015, Applied Materials left the solar wafer sawing and the solar ion implantation businesses.

Applied Materials was named among FORTUNE World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies in 2018.

In 2019, Applied Materials announced its intention to buy semiconductor equipment manufacturer (and former Hitachi group member) Kokusai Electric Corporation from private equity firm KKR for $2.2 billion, but terminated the deal in March 2021 citing delays in getting approval from China&#x27;s regulator.

In November 2023, Applied Materials was reported to be under criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice for routing equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation via South Korea in violation of US sanctions.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2021, Applied Materials reported earnings of US$5.888 billion, with an annual revenue of US$23.063 billion, a 34% increase over the previous fiscal. Applied Materials market capitalization was valued at over US$36.6 billion in November 2018.
==Organization==
Applied is organized into three major business sectors: Semiconductor Products, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. Applied Materials also operates a venture investing arm called Applied Ventures.

=== Semiconductor Products ===
The company develops and manufactures equipment used in the wafer fabrication steps of creating a semiconductor device, including atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), etch, ion implantation and wafer inspection. The company acquired Semitool for this group in late 2009. In 2019, Applied Materials agreed to buy semiconductor manufacturer Kokusai for $2.2 Billion.

=== Applied Global Services ===
The Applied Global Services (AGS) group offers equipment installation support and warranty extended support, as well as maintenance support. AGS also offers new and refurbished equipment, as well as upgrades and enhancements for installed base equipment. This sector also includes automation software for manufacturing environments.

=== Display and Adjacent Markets ===

AGS combined an existing business unit with the display business of Applied Films Corporation, acquired in mid-2006.

The manufacturing process for TFT LCDs (thin film transistor liquid crystal displays), commonly employed in computer monitors and televisions, is similar to that employed for integrated circuits. In cleanroom environments both TFT-LCD and integrated circuit production use photolithography, chemical and physical vapor deposition, and testing.

=== Energy and Environmental Solutions (former sector) ===

In 2006, the company acquired Applied Films, a glass coating and web coating business. Also in 2006, Applied announced it was entering the solar manufacturing equipment business. The solar, glass and web businesses were organized into the company&#x27;s Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) sector.

In 2007, Applied Materials announced the Applied SunFab thin film photovoltaic module production line, with single or tandem junction capability. SunFab applies silicon thin film layers to glass substrate that then produce electricity when exposed to sunlight. In 2009, the company&#x27;s SunFab line was certified by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In 2010, Applied announced that it was abandoning the thin film market and closing down their SunFab division. Also in 2007, the company acquired privately held, Switzerland-based HCT Shaping Systems SA, a specialist in wafer sawing tools for both solar and semiconductor wafer manufacture, paying approximately $475 million.

In 2008, Applied acquired privately held, Italy-based Baccini SpA for $330M, company that worked in the metallization steps of solar cell manufacturing. The company was listed at the top of VLSI Research&#x27;s list of supplier of photovoltaic manufacturing equipment for 2008, with sales of $797M.

Since July 2016 the Energy and Environmental Solutions sector is no longer reported separately. Remaining solar business activities have been included in &quot;Corporate and Others&quot;.

== Locations ==
Applied moved into its Bowers Avenue headquarters in Santa Clara, California, in 1974 and operates in Europe, Japan, Canada, the United States, Israel, China, Italy, India, Korea, Southeast Asia, Singapore and Taiwan.

<doc id="479728" wikidata="Q7300772" url="?curid=479728" title="Real-time Cmix">
<text>Real-Time Cmix (RTcmix) is one of the MUSIC-N family of computer music programming languages. RTcmix is descended from the MIX program developed by Paul Lansky at Princeton University in 1978 to perform algorithmic composition using digital audio soundfiles on an IBM 3031 mainframe computer. After synthesis functions were added, the program was renamed Cmix in the 1980s. Real-time capability was added by David Topper, John Gibson, Brad Garton, and Douglas Scott in the mid-1990s. In addition, support for TCP socket connectivity, interactive control of the scheduler were added, as well as the ability to embed the synthesis engine into fully featured applications such as Max/MSP.

Over the years Cmix/RTcmix has run on a variety of computer platforms and operating systems, including NeXT, Sun Microsystems, IRIX, Linux, and Mac OS X. It is and has always been an open source project, differentiating it from commercial synthesizers and music software. It is currently developed by a group of computer music researchers both academic (at Princeton University, Columbia University, and Indiana University Bloomington), and private.

RTcmix has a number of unique (or highly unusual) features when compared with other synthesis and signal processing languages. For one, it has a built-in MINC parser, which enables the user to write C-style code within the score file, extending its capability for algorithmic composition and making it closer in some respects to later music software such as SuperCollider and Max/MSP. It uses a single-script instruction file (the score file), and synthesis and signal processing routines (called instruments) loaded as shared libraries. This is different from MUSIC-N languages such as Csound where the instruments exist in a second file written in a specification language that builds the routines out of simple building blocks (organized as opcodes or unit generators). RTcmix has similar functionality to Csound and other computer music languages, however, and their shared lineage means that scripts written for one language will be extremely familiar-looking (if not immediately comprehensible) to users of the other language.

<doc id="479733" wikidata="Q461734" url="?curid=479733" title="Sheila Jackson Lee">
<text>Sheila Jackson Lee ( Jackson; January 12, 1950 – July 19, 2024) was an American lawyer and politician who was the U.S. representative for , from 1995 until her death in 2024. The district includes most of central Houston. She was a member of the Democratic Party and served as an at-large member of the Houston City Council before being elected to the House. She was also co-dean of Texas&#x27;s congressional delegation.

Born in Queens, New York, Jackson Lee earned a scholarship for Black students at New York University before transferring to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Yale University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975. In 1987, after she had moved to Houston, she was appointed as a municipal judge for the city by Kathy Whitmire. In 1989, Jackson Lee was elected to the Houston City Council. She served in the office until 1994 when she began a campaign for a seat in the U.S. Congress. In the Democratic primary, she defeated incumbent Craig Washington and went on to easily win the general election.

During her congressional tenure, Jackson Lee supported progressive policies such as gun control and Medicare for All. She introduced the Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act in 2013 and the Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration Act in 2021. In 2019, Jackson Lee stepped down as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and a subcommittee in the House Judiciary after a lawsuit filed by a former staffer claimed she was fired due to planned legal action against an alleged rape by a supervisor.

Jackson Lee announced her candidacy for the 2023 Houston mayoral election in March of that year. In the first round, she placed second behind state senator John Whitmire. However, as no candidate crossed the 50% threshold to win outright, a runoff election occurred on December 9, 2023. Despite several key endorsements, Jackson Lee lost the election to Whitmire. On December 11, she filed to run for re-election to her congressional seat and won the Democratic primary on March 5, 2024. In July 2024, she died in office after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

==Early life and career in Texas==

Sheila Jackson was born in the New York City borough of Queens on January 12, 1950. Her father, Ezra Clyde Jackson, who was born in Brooklyn, was a comic book artist and the son of Jamaican immigrants. Her mother, Ivalita Bennett Jackson, was a nurse, and came to New York at an early age from her birthplace of St. Petersburg, Florida.

Jackson graduated from Jamaica High School in Queens. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Yale University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1975. She moved to Houston in 1987 when her husband, Elwyn Lee, accepted a position at the University of Houston. She got a job at Leon Jaworski&#x27;s law firm. She made three previous unsuccessful attempts at local judgeships before becoming a Houston municipal judge, a position she held from 1987 to 1990. Kathy Whitmire, the mayor of Houston, appointed Jackson Lee to the position, along with Sylvia Garcia.

In 1989, Jackson Lee won the at-large position for a seat on the Houston City Council, serving until 1994. On the city council, she helped pass a safety ordinance that required parents to keep their guns away from children. She also worked for expanded summer hours at city parks and recreation centers as a way to combat gang violence.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===1994 run for office===
In 1994, Jackson Lee challenged four-term incumbent U.S. Representative Craig Washington in the Democratic primary. Washington had come under fire for opposing several projects that would have benefited the Houston area. Jackson Lee defeated Washington, 63% to 37%. The victory was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. In the general election, she defeated Republican nominee Jerry Burley, 73%–24%.

===Tenure===
Before the 110th Congress, Jackson Lee served on the House Science Committee and on the Subcommittee that oversees space policy and NASA. She was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a CBC whip.

On September 27, 2013, Jackson Lee introduced the Essential Transportation Worker Identification Credential Assessment Act (H.R. 3202; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security to assess the effectiveness of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. The bill would require an independent assessment of how well the TWIC program improves security and reduces risks at the facilities and vessels it is responsible for.

In January 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Jackson Lee planned to resign as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. The move came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by a former staffer earlier in January that claimed the staffer was fired in retaliation for her planned legal action related to an alleged rape by a supervisor in 2015. The resignation came the day after the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence announced it would not support making Jackson Lee the lead sponsor of a law to reauthorize the federal Violence Against Women Act. She also stepped down from her chairmanship of the House Judiciary subcommittee.

On January 4, 2021, Jackson Lee introduced the Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration Act (H.R. 127; 117th Congress), a bill that expanded requirements for firearm licensing to every firearm and banned any ammunition of .50 caliber BMG or larger.

In the 117th Congress (2021–2023), Jackson Lee voted with United States President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100 percent of the time, according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis. Jackson Lee and Representative Lloyd Doggett became co-deans of Texas&#x27;s congressional delegation in January 2023 after the retirement of Eddie Bernice Johnson.

=== Staffing issues ===
In 1998, &quot;The Houston Press&quot; reported that five of Jackson Lee&#x27;s staffers had quit that spring. The paper quoted her former Capitol office executive assistant and events scheduler, Rhiannon Burruss, as saying that &quot;the congresswoman&#x27;s abrasive ways not only drove off staff members but irritated Continental Airlines staffers to the point where one suggested she fly on a competitor instead.&quot;
In 2011, Jackson Lee was reported to have one of the highest staff turnover rates in Congress. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reported that she had gone through 11 chiefs of staff in the course of 11 years. A 2013 report concluded that &quot;the veteran Texas Democrat had the highest turnover rate for all of Congress over the [previous] decade.&quot; &quot;Washingtonian magazine&quot; named Jackson Lee as the &quot;meanest Democratic Congress member&quot; in both 2014 and 2017. In 2018, LegiStorm reported that Jackson Lee&#x27;s annual turnover rate, at 62%, was the highest in Congress.

In 2023, during her Houston mayoral run, an unverified audio leaked of Jackson Lee berating her staffers with profanity. The recording was about a minute and half in length, where Jackson Lee allegedly tells a staffer she wants him to have a &quot;fuckin&#x27; brain&quot; and that &quot;nobody knows a Goddamn thing in my office — nothing.&quot; She then describes a different staffer as a &quot;fat-ass stupid idiot&quot; and that both of them are &quot;fuck-ups&quot; and that they are &quot;two Goddamn big-ass children, fuckin&#x27; idiots who serve no Goddamn purpose.&quot; Her mayoral campaign refused to verify the authenticity of the recording and alleged that &quot;these attacks have originated from extremely conservative blogs and political operatives backing John Whitmire.&quot; Whitmire&#x27;s campaign stated they had no involvement with the recording. Jackson Lee responded to the release of the recording by saying, &quot;I am regretful and hope you will judge me not by something trotted out by a political opponent ... but from what I&#x27;ve delivered to Houstonians over my years of public service&quot; and said that &quot;everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and that includes my own staff.&quot;

** Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security
** Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security

==2023 Houston mayoral run==
On March 27, 2023, Jackson Lee announced her candidacy for the mayor of Houston in the 2023 election. Jackson Lee garnered endorsements from notable political figures such as outgoing Houston mayor Sylvester Turner, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On November 7, 2023, Jackson Lee came in second place in the election, behind Democratic state senator John Whitmire. However, none of the 18 candidates who ran managed to surpass the required 50 percent threshold.

Jackson Lee and Whitmire advanced to a runoff election on December 9, 2023. Jackson Lee was ultimately defeated by Whitmire, who won with nearly 65 percent of the vote. Following her loss, Jackson Lee filed for re-election to her U.S. House seat on December 11, 2023.

== Political views and statements ==
=== Foreign policy ===
In 2000, Jackson Lee favored permanently normalizing trade status for the People&#x27;s Republic of China and argued that it would aid both human rights and Houston&#x27;s economy.

Jackson Lee traveled to the 2001 World Conference against Racism in South Africa, and backed sanctions against Sudan. Jackson Lee voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 that authorized the Iraq War. On April 28, 2006, along with four other members of Congress and six other activists, she was arrested for disorderly conduct in front of Sudan&#x27;s embassy in Washington DC. They were protesting the role of Sudan&#x27;s government in ethnic cleansing in Darfur.

Jackson Lee urged for better relations between the U.S. and Venezuela, which she described as a friendly nation. She said the U.S. should reconsider its ban on selling F-16 fighter jets and spare parts to Venezuela. The United States Department of State bans such sales due to the alleged &quot;lack of support&quot; for counter-terrorist operations and Venezuela&#x27;s relations with Iran and Cuba.

In May 2015, Jackson Lee took a trip to Azerbaijan, paid by the Azerbaijani government.

Jackson Lee condemned the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s wide-ranging purges following a failed July 2016 coup in Turkey.

After the Iranian retaliatory strikes in April for the Israeli bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Jackson Lee posted on Twitter that &quot;Iran is a terrorist nation.&quot; and that the nation had &quot;launched a disproportionate terrorist attack against our ally Israel.&quot;

=== Domestic policy ===
Jackson Lee was active on immigration issues. She had proposed increasing border security and increasing opportunities for legalization among those living in the U.S. She opposed a guest worker program, saying that the idea &quot;connotate[s] &#x27;invite, come,&#x27; and, at the same time, it misleads because you ask people to come for a temporary job of three to six years and they have to leave if they don&#x27;t have another job and I would think that they would not.&quot;

Jackson Lee opposed repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

At a March 2011 Homeland Security Committee hearing on radical Muslims in the U.S., Jackson Lee said that Peter King&#x27;s hearings were helping al-Qaeda and &quot;going the same route as Arizona.&quot; She complained that the hearings were scaring Muslim Americans and called them &quot;an outrage&quot;.

Following Debbie Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s resignation as chair after the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak, Jackson Lee campaigned with her and traveled the districts African American churches with Wasserman Schultz for her primary campaign against Tim Canova.

In August 2022, Jackson Lee voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. Jackson Lee was one of three Democrats that abstained from voting in the successful formal censure of congresswoman Rashida Tlaib proposed by Rich McCormick.

=== LGBT rights ===
Jackson Lee voted &quot;present&quot; on the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996. In 2009, she voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a bill that expanded the federal hate crime law to cover crimes biased by the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2010, she voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act that allowed gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to serve openly in the U.S. military.

In 2019, Jackson Lee voted for the Equality Act, which expanded the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Jackson Lee criticized Republican representatives who opposed the legislation on religious grounds.

=== Racial issues ===
In 2003, Jackson Lee suggested changing the naming practices for tropical cyclones and hurricanes, saying that &quot;all racial groups should be represented&quot; and that meteorological organizations should &quot;try to be inclusive of African American names.&quot;

Speaking at the July 2010 NAACP national convention, Jackson Lee compared the Tea Party movement to the Ku Klux Klan, saying that &quot;all those who wore sheets a long time ago have now lifted them off&quot;. Jackson Lee&#x27;s remarks were criticized by conservatives, including Tea Party Caucus founder Michele Bachmann (R-MN).

In December 2017, Jackson Lee was accused of having been given preferential treatment by United Airlines by a passenger who claimed a first class seat ticket she had purchased had been given to the congresswoman. United Airlines had claimed that the woman who purchased the first class seat had cancelled her ticket and later apologized for the incident. Jackson Lee claimed she was accused because she was &quot;an African American woman&quot;.

Jackson Lee was one of the leading lawmakers behind the effort to have Juneteenth recognized as an American federal holiday. Recognition was achieved in 2021.

Following the death of Rep. John Conyers in 2019, Jackson Lee also became the lead sponsor for H. R. 40, the bill that Conyers had introduced since 1989 to establish a Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans. In 2019, on June 19, or Juneteenth, Jackson Lee presided over a House Judiciary Committee hearing about the bill. Two years later, the committee voted to report the bill to the House.


=== Presidential election objections ===
In 2001, Jackson Lee and other House members objected to counting Florida&#x27;s electoral votes, which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount in the 2000 presidential election. Because no senator joined the objection, it was dismissed by Senate President Al Gore.

In 2005, Jackson Lee was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted not to count Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

During the 2017 United States Electoral College vote count, Jackson Lee objected to counting North Carolina, South Carolina, and Wyoming&#x27;s electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election. Because no senator joined her objections, they were dismissed.

=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, Jackson Lee appealed to city officials in Houston for free and reduced-price parking at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport. This reduced the number of bus riders by about 1000 employees per day and increased social distancing. Jackson Lee also supported airline workers at United Airlines that were targeted for furloughs after the airline had accepted billions of dollars in taxpayer funds through the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program.

=== Gaffes ===
According to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Jackson Lee had a &quot;history of wild statements&quot; and political gaffes. These include incorrectly stating that the U.S. Constitution was 400 years old; mistakenly criticizing Wikipedia instead of WikiLeaks; incorrectly calling the Moon a &quot;planet&quot; that is made &quot;mostly of gases&quot;; and saying that North Vietnam and South Vietnam were, in 2010, still separate countries.

&quot;The Hill&quot; reported that during a 1997 visit to the Mars Pathfinder operations center, Jackson Lee asked whether the Pathfinder rover had taken a picture of the U.S. flag planted by Neil Armstrong; the flag had been planted on the Moon, not Mars. Jackson Lee was at the time a member of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics of the House Science Committee. In response, Jackson Lee&#x27;s deputy chief of staff accused the newspaper of racial bias without disputing the story&#x27;s accuracy. &quot;The Hill&quot; denied the allegations and stood by its reporting.

In July 2014, Jackson Lee said that &quot;we did not seek an impeachment&quot; of President George W. Bush. Jackson Lee was one of 11 co-sponsors of the 2008 U.S. House bill H. Res. 1258, which sought to impeach Bush for &quot;deceiving Congress with fabricated threats of Iraq WMDs&quot;. Jackson Lee&#x27;s spokesperson later said that she &quot;misspoke&quot;.

A campaign advertisement for Jackson Lee in the 2023 Houston mayoral election instructed viewers to vote on the wrong date. Jackson Lee&#x27;s spokesperson attributed the error to an external advertising agency.

President Joe Biden arrived in Houston on Monday, July 29, 2024 to pay respects to Jackson Lee. During Jackson Lee&#x27;s funeral service at Houston&#x27;s Fallbrook Church on August 1, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris gave the eulogy. Speakers included Bill Clinton, his wife and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and U.S. House members Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal.

<text>Carioca ( ) is a demonym used to refer to residents of the City of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil and their culture. 

Like other Brazilians, &quot;Cariocas&quot; speak Portuguese. The &quot;carioca&quot; accent and sociolect (also simply called &quot;&quot;carioca&quot;, see below) are one of the most widely recognized in Brazil, in part because TV Globo, the second-largest television network in the world, is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro. Thus, many Brazilian TV programs, from news and documentary to entertainment (such as the telenovelas), feature &quot;carioca&quot;-acting and -speaking talent.

==Etymology==
The original meaning of the term is controversial, maybe from Tupi language &quot;kari&#x27; oka&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;white house&quot; as the whitewashed stone houses of European settlers or even the colonists themselves, by merging &quot;&quot;kara&#x27;iwa&quot; (white man) and &quot;oka&quot; (house). Currently, the more accepted origin in academia is the meaning derived from &quot;kariîó oka&quot;&quot;, which comes from Tupi &quot;house of carijó&quot;, which was Guaraní, a native tribe of Rio de Janeiro who lived in the vicinity of the Carioca River, between the neighborhoods of &quot;Glória&quot; and &quot;Flamengo&quot;.

==History==

The archaic demonym for the Rio de Janeiro State is &quot;Fluminense&quot;, taken from the Latin word &quot;flūmen&quot;, meaning &quot;river&quot;. Despite the fact that &quot;Carioca&quot; is a more ancient demonym of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s inhabitants (known since 1502), it was replaced by &quot;fluminense&quot; in 1783, when the latter was sanctioned as the official demonym of the Royal Captainship of Rio de Janeiro (later the Province of Rio de Janeiro). A few years after, the City of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro had become the capital city of the Brazilian colonies. From 1783 and during all the Imperial Regime, &quot;Carioca&quot; remained only as a nickname by which other Brazilians called the inhabitants of Rio (city and province). During the first years of the Brazilian Republic, &quot;Carioca&quot; was the name given to those who lived in the slums or a pejorative way to refer to the bureaucratic elite of the Federal District. 

Only when the City of Rio lost its status as Federal District and became a Brazilian State (Guanabara State), when the capital city was moved to Brasilia, was &quot;Carioca&quot; made a co-official demonym with &quot;Guanabarino&quot;. In 1975, the Guanabara State was eliminated by President Ernesto Geisel (under the military dictatorship), becoming the present-day City of Rio de Janeiro, and &quot;Carioca&quot; was made the demonym of its municipality. 

Nowadays, Carioca is used to exclusively refer to those born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, while everyone born in the state of Rio de Janeiro is referred to as a Fluminense.

==Accomplishments and influence==

&quot;Carioca&quot; people have invented a few sports; the most famous is footvolley.

&quot;Cariocas&quot; are credited with creating the bossa nova style of music.

Famous &quot;Cariocas&quot; in film include &quot;Brazilian bombshell&quot; Carmen Miranda, a Portuguese-born Brazilian woman who grew up in Rio de Janeiro. The eponymous song &quot;Carioca&quot;, from the 1933 film &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;, has become a jazz standard.
&quot;Carnaval Carioca&quot; is the Portuguese name for the largest Brazilian Carnival, the Rio Carnival.

&quot;Samba Carioca&quot; is a localized style of Brazilian Samba.
There is an exercise drill used for dynamic stretching called &quot;Carioca&quot;. It consists of a repeating Samba dance step.

== Sociolect == 
The Portuguese spoken across the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo and neighboring towns in Minas Gerais (and to a certain extent the city of Florianópolis), has similar features, hardly different from one another so cities such as Paraty, Resende, Campos dos Goytacazes, Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Vila Velha and Linhares may be said to have the same dialect as Rio de Janeiro, as they are hardly perceived as strong regional variants by people from other parts of Brazil.

The Brazilian Portuguese variant spoken in the city of Rio de Janeiro (and metropolitan area) is called , and it is called locally, literally translated as &quot;accent&quot;. It can be said that Rio de Janeiro presents a sociolect inside the major Fluminense-Capixaba dialect, as speakers inside the city may be easily recognizable more by their slang than the way the phonology of their speech, which is closer to the standard Brazilian Portuguese in the media than other variants. It is known especially for several distinctive traits new to either variant (European or Brazilian) of the Portuguese language:

# (for Brazilians) Coda and can be pronounced as palato-alveolar and of English or the alveolo-palatal and of Catalan. That is inherited from European Portuguese, and &quot;Carioca&quot; shares it only with Florianopolitano and some other &quot;Fluminense&quot; accents. In the northern tones of Brazilian Portuguese, not all coda and become postalveolar.
# (for Europeans) , as well what would be coda (when it is not pre-vocalic) in European Portuguese, may be realized as various voiceless and voiced guttural-like sounds, most often the latter (unlike in other parts of Brazil), and many or most of them can be part of the phonetic repertory of a single speaker. Among them the velar and uvular fricative pairs, as well both glottal transitions (voiced &amp; unvoiced), the voiceless pharyngeal fricative and the uvular trill: , (between vowels), , , , , and . That diversity of allophones of a single rhotic phoneme is rare not just in Brazilian Portuguese but among world languages.
# (for both) The consonants and before or final unstressed (, that in this position may be raised to or deleted) become affricates [ ~ ] and [ ~ ] (again, as those of English or Catalan, depending on the speaker), respectively. Originally probably from Tupi influence, through the Portuguese post-creole that appeared in southeastern Brazil after the ban of Língua Geral Paulista as a marker of Jesuit activity by the Marquis of Pombal, this is now common place in Brazilian Portuguese, as it spread with the , expansion of &quot;Mineiros&quot; to the Center-West and mass media. It is not as universal in São Paulo, Espírito Santo and southern Brazil even though they were populated mostly by the original &quot;bandeirantes&quot; (caboclos, formerly Língua Geral speakers) because the European immigrants learning Portuguese and their descendants preferred more conservative registers of the language, perhaps as a mark of a separate social identity. The Northeast had Nheengatu, another Língua Geral, too, but it had a greater native Portuguese-speaker presence, had a greater contact with the colonial metropolis and was more densely populated.
# (for both) Historical ( in syllable coda), which merged with coda () in &quot;Caipira&quot;, has undergone labialization to , and then vocalized to []; Nevertheless, with the exception of [] being used in Southern Brazil and São Paulo instead of , both commonly transcribed as , the process is now nearly ubiquitous in Brazilian Portuguese so only some areas retain velarized lateral alveolar approximant (rural areas close to the frontier with Uruguay) or the retroflex approximant (a very few &quot;caipira&quot; areas) as coda .

The traits (particularly the &quot;chiado&quot;, a palatalization process that creates a postalveolar pronunciation of coda &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; and affricate pronunciation of and and &quot;te&quot; and &quot;de&quot; rhymes), as a whole and consistent among the vast majority of speakers, were once specifically characteristic of Rio de Janeiro speech and distinguished particularly from the pronunciation of São Paulo and areas further south, which formerly had adapted none of the characteristics. The &quot;chiado&quot; of the coda sibilant is thought to date from the early 1800s occupation of the city by the Portuguese royal family, as European Portuguese had a similar characteristic for the postalveolar codas.

More recently, however, all of the traits have spread throughout much of the country by the cultural influence of the city that diminished the social marker character the lack of palatalization once had (a part of assimilation of the caboclo minorities in most of South and Southeast Brazil). Affrication is today widespread, if not nearly omnipresent among young Brazilians, and coda guttural r is also found nationwide (their presence in Brazil is a general heritage of Tupi speech too) but less among speakers in the 5 southernmost states other than Rio de Janeiro, and if accent is a good social indicator, 95-105 million Brazilians consistently palatalize coda sibilant in some instances (but as in Rio de Janeiro, it is only a marker of adoption of foreign phonology at large in Florianópolis and Belém: palatalization, as in any other Romance language, is a very old process in Portuguese and its lacking in some dialect rather than reflecting a specific set of Galician, Spanish and indigenous influences on their formation).

Another common characteristic of &quot;Carioca&quot; speech is, in a stressed final syllable, the addition of /j/ before coda /s/ (&quot;mas&quot;, &quot;dez&quot; may become , which can also be noted ambiguously as ). The change may have originated in the Northeast, where pronunciations such as &quot;Jesus&quot; have long been heard. Also immigration from Northeastern Brazil and Spanish immigration causes debuccalization of the coda sibilant: &quot;mesmo&quot; . Many Brazilians assume that is specific to Rio, but in the Northeast, debuccalization has long been a strong and advanced phonological process that may also affect onset sibilants and as well as other consonants, primarily .

There are some grammatical characteristics of this sociolect as well, an important one is the mixing of second person pronouns &quot;você&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;, even in the same speech. For instance, while normative Portuguese requires &quot;lhe&quot; as the oblique for &quot;você&quot; and &quot;te&quot; as oblique for &quot;tu&quot;, in &quot;Carioca&quot; slang, the once formal &quot;você&quot; (now widespread as an informal pronoun in many Brazilian Portuguese varieties) is used for all cases. In informal speech, the pronoun &quot;tu&quot; is retained, but with the verb forms belonging to the form você: &quot;Tu foi na festa?&quot; (&quot;Did you go to the party?&quot;). So the verbal forms are the same for both &quot;você&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;.

Many &quot;Cariocas&quot; and many &quot;Paulistas&quot; (from the coast, capital city or hinterland) shorten &quot;você&quot; and use &quot;cê&quot; instead: &quot;Cê vai pra casa agora?&quot; (&quot;Are you going home now?&quot;). That, however, is common only on the spoken language and is rarely written.

Slang words among youngsters from Rio de Janeiro include &quot;caraca!&quot; (gosh!) [now spread throughout Brazil], &quot;e aê?&quot; and &quot;qualé/quaé/coé?&quot; (literally &quot;which is [it]&quot;, carrying a meaning similar to &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot;), &quot;maneiro&quot; (&quot;cool&quot;, &quot;fine&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;amusing&quot;), &quot;mermão&quot; (&quot;bro&quot;, contraction of &quot;meu irmão&quot;), &quot;caô&quot; (a lie), and &quot;sinistro&quot; (in standard Portuguese, &quot;sinister&quot;; in slang, &quot;awesome,&quot; &quot;terrific,&quot; but also &quot;terrible,&quot; &quot;troublesome,&quot; &quot;frightening,&quot; &quot;weird&quot;). Many of these slang words can be found in practically all of Brazil by to cultural influence from the city. Much slang from Rio de Janeiro spreads across Brazil and may be not known as originally from there, and those less culturally accepted elsewhere are sometimes used to shun not only the speech of a certain subculture, age group or social class but also the whole accent.

<text>A stateless protocol is a communication protocol in which the receiver must not retain session state from previous requests. The sender transfers relevant session state to the receiver in such a way that every request can be understood in isolation, that is without reference to session state from previous requests retained by the receiver.

In contrast, a stateful protocol is a communication protocol in which the receiver may retain session state from previous requests.

In computer networks, examples of stateless protocols include the Internet Protocol (IP), which is the foundation for the Internet, and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. Examples of stateful protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

Stateless protocols improve the properties of visibility, reliability, and scalability. Visibility is improved because a monitoring system does not have to look beyond a single request in order to determine its full nature. Reliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from partial failures. Scalability is improved because not having to store session state between requests allows the server to quickly free resources and further simplifies implementation.

The disadvantage of stateless protocols is that they may decrease network performance by increasing the repetitive data sent in a series of requests, since that data cannot be left on the server and reused.

== Examples ==
An HTTP server can understand each request in isolation.

Contrast this with a traditional FTP server that conducts an interactive session with the user. During the session, a user is provided a means to be authenticated and set various variables (working directory, transfer mode), all stored on the server as part of the session state.

== Stacking of stateless and stateful protocol layers ==
There can be complex interactions between stateful and stateless protocols among different protocol layers. For example, HTTP, a stateless protocol, is layered on top of TCP, a stateful protocol, which is layered on top of IP, another stateless protocol, which is routed on a network that employs BGP, another stateful protocol, to direct the IP packets riding on the network.

This stacking of layers continues even above HTTP. As a workaround for the lack of a retained session state, HTTP servers implement various session management methods, typically utilizing a session identifier in an HTTP cookie referencing a session state stored on the server, effectively creating a stateful protocol on top of HTTP. HTTP cookies violate the REST architectural style because even without referencing a session state stored on the server, they are independent of session state (they affect previous pages of the same website in the browser history) and they have no defined semantics.

<text>Blade II is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Blade, directed by Guillermo del Toro and written by David S. Goyer. A sequel to &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), it is the second installment in the &quot;Blade&quot; trilogy. The film follows the human-vampire hybrid Blade in his continuing effort to protect humans from vampires. Blade must join forces with an elite group of vampires to fight against mutant vampires who plan a global genocide of both vampire and human races.

&quot;Blade II&quot; was released in the United States on March 22, 2002, and was a box office success, grossing $155 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, earning praise for its performances, atmosphere, direction, and action sequences, although its script and lack of character development have been criticized. The final film in the trilogy, &quot;,&quot; followed in 2004.

==Plot==
In Prague, Blade searches for his mentor Abraham Whistler, who was thought dead after being attacked by Deacon Frost, but was instead turned into a vampire and held prisoner by them for two years. After interrogating vampire Rush on Whistler&#x27;s whereabouts, Blade rescues Whistler and cures him of his vampirism. Whistler meets Scud, Blade&#x27;s young, gifted new technician.

A pandemic is turning vampires into &quot;Reapers&quot;, primal, mutant creatures with a ravenous thirst for blood and a highly infectious bite that transforms both humans and vampires alike. The original carrier of the Reaper strain and cause of the pandemic is Jared Nomak, who bears hatred toward the vampire race. To combat the Reapers, vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos sends his trusted servant Asad and his daughter, Nyssa, to strike a truce with Blade. Knowing humans will be the Reapers’ next target after vampires, Blade reluctantly allies himself with them.

He teams up with the Bloodpack, an elite group of vampires originally assembled to kill him, consisting of Asad, Nyssa, Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Priest, Verlaine, and her lover, Lighthammer. As Reinhardt openly challenges him to fight, Blade, in response, attaches an explosive to the back of his skull to keep him in line. They investigate a vampire nightclub where they encounter the Reapers and discover they are immune to most vampire weaknesses except for UV exposure. Nomak arrives and tries to recruit Blade to his cause, but the latter refuses. Blade fights Nomak but cannot kill him due to his immunity to his weapons before the sun rises and Nomak retreats. Lighthammer is bitten but conceals the bite from the group while Priest is bitten and in the process of turning before being mercy-killed through exposure to sunlight.

Whistler returns to the group after locating the Reaper nest beneath the sewers. Nyssa dissects a dead Reaper and learns that their hearts are encased in durable bone. Scud and Whistler issue new UV weapons for the team and a UV-emitting bomb to take out the entire nest.

Entering the Reaper nest at dawn, Lighthammer transforms into a Reaper and kills Snowman. Verlaine sacrifices herself to kill Lighthammer by exposing them both to sunlight. Chupa turns on Whistler in retaliation for Priest&#x27;s death, but Whistler secretly releases a cartridge of Reaper pheromones into the air, luring a horde that kills and devours Chupa. Asad and Nyssa are ambushed, and Asad is killed. Blade saves Nyssa and detonates the UV bomb, killing all the Reapers except Nomak. Nyssa and Reinhardt manage to evade the blast, but Nyssa is seriously injured until Blade allows her to drink his blood to survive.

Damaskinos&#x27; forces arrive and capture Blade, Whistler, and Scud. It is revealed that the Reapers exist due to Damaskinos&#x27;s efforts to engineer a stronger breed of vampires devoid of their natural weaknesses. Nomak, the first Reaper, is his own son, whom Damaskinos considers a failure. Scud reveals himself to be one of Damaskinos&#x27;s familiars, but Blade, who already suspected this, kills him with the explosive he planted on Reinhardt earlier, which Scud originally thought was a dud until Blade secretly swapped it with a real explosive.

Damaskinos plans to harvest Blade&#x27;s blood to develop an immunity to sunlight and create a new, invincible breed of vampires. Whistler frees himself, escapes with Reinhardt, and rescues a weakened Blade. Reinhardt shoots at the two, but Blade falls into Damaskinos&#x27; blood pool, restoring his strength. He fights his way through Damaskinos&#x27; henchmen and kills Reinhardt.

Nomak enters Damaskinos&#x27;s stronghold, seeking revenge on his father. Nyssa, seeing how her father holds no regard for his own offspring, betrays Damaskinos by sealing off their escape route, and Nomak kills Damaskinos after failing to negotiate with him. Nomak then bites Nyssa, infecting her with the Reaper virus. Blade and Nomak engage in battle, and he manages to stab Nomak through his encased heart. Wanting to end his suffering, Nomak kills himself with Blade&#x27;s sword. Fulfilling Nyssa&#x27;s dying wish, Blade takes her outside and embraces her as her body disintegrates from the sunrise. Sometime later in London, Blade tracks down Rush to a strip club booth and kills him.

==Production==
Following the success of the original film, New Line Cinema and Marvel Enterprises made plans for a sequel in 1999. Goyer had planned to use Morbius but Marvel wanted to keep the character for a franchise of his own. Goyer compared the story to &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;. Guillermo del Toro was hired to direct &quot;Blade II&quot; by New Line Cinema production president Michael De Luca after Stephen Norrington turned down the offer to direct the sequel. Goyer and Frankfurt both admired director Guillermo del Toro and believed his dark sensibilities to be ideal for &quot;Blade II&quot;. Frankfurt first met del Toro when Frankfurt&#x27;s design company, Imaginary Forces, did the title sequences for &quot;Mimic&quot;: &quot;I admired &quot;Mimic&quot; and got to know Guillermo through that film. Both David Goyer and I have been fans of his since &quot;Cronos&quot; and were enthusiastic about him coming on board. Guillermo is such a visual director and has a very strong sense of how he wants a movie to look. When you sign on with someone like Guillermo you&#x27;re not going to tell him what the movie should look like, you&#x27;re going to let him run with it&quot;. Like Goyer, del Toro has a passion for comic books, in Goyer&#x27;s comment: &quot;Guillermo was weaned on comic books, as was I. I was a huge comic book collector, my brother and I had about twelve thousand comic books that we assembled when we were kids, so I know my background&quot;. Tippett Studio provided computer-generated visual effects, including digital doubles of some of the characters, while Steve Johnson and his company XFX were hired to create the prosthetic makeup and animatronic effects.

Del Toro was tired of the romantic concept of &quot;vampires being tortured Victorian heroes&quot; and wanted vampires to be scary again. 
Del Toro chose not to alter the script too much from the ideas created by Goyer and Snipes. According to del Toro: &quot;I wanted the movie to have a feeling of both a comic book and Japanese animation. I resurrected those sources and viewed them again. I dissected most of the dailies from the first movie; I literally grabbed about four boxes of tapes and one by one saw every single tape from beginning to end until I perfectly understood where the language of the first film came from. I studied the style of the first one and I think Norrington used a tremendous narrative style. His work is very elegant&quot;.

Stepping back into Blade&#x27;s shoes was a challenge Wesley Snipes relished: &quot;I love playing this role. It&#x27;s fun as an actor to test your skills at doing a sequel, to see if you can recreate something that you did&quot;. Peter Frankfurt added that &quot;Wesley is Blade; so much of the character was invented by Wesley and his instincts are so spot on. He takes his fighting, his weapons and attitude very seriously. He&#x27;s incredibly focused, but he&#x27;s also very cool and fun&quot;.

Del Toro said that &quot;Wesley knows Blade better than David Goyer, better than me, better than anyone else involved in the franchise. He instinctively knows what the character would and wouldn&#x27;t do, and every time he twists something around, something better would come out&quot;.

Filming took place in the Czech Republic, at Prague Studios and Barrandov Studios, as well as London from March 12, 2001, and concluded on July 2 the same year.

==Music==

A soundtrack to the film was released on March 19, 2002, through Immortal Records and Virgin Records, and which featured collaborations between hip hop artists and electronic artists. This soundtrack appeared on four different &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned two singles: &quot;Child of the Wild West&quot; and &quot;Mind What You Say&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
The New Line Platinum Series DVD contains several deleted scenes, including a flashback sequence showing Blade&#x27;s first meeting with Whistler, and a music video for &quot;Child of the Wild West&quot;, performed by West Coast hip-hop group Cypress Hill and featuring drum and bass performer Roni Size in the DVD special features on disc 2, VHS Capture, and the theatrical trailer.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Blade II&quot; was released on March 22, 2002. This was during a period of the year (months March and April) considered to be a bad time for sequels to be released. Despite this, the film became the highest-grossing film of the &quot;Blade&quot; series, making $80 million in the United States and $150 million worldwide. In its opening weekend, the film earned $32,528,016 from 2,707 theaters, but dropped 59% of its earnings in its second week, which brought in $13.2 million. The intake is believed to be affected (in part) by the pull of NCAA basketball Final Four games. The film debuted in the United Kingdom at number one, making $3.6 million from 355 theaters and held the spot for the following week, where it had earned $7.9 million, despite a 47% decline. The film was also number one in Singapore, making $214,000 from 30 theaters.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Though &quot;Blade II&quot; offers more of what worked in the original, its plot and character development appear to have been left on the cutting room floor.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, stating: &quot;&quot;Blade II&quot; is a really rather brilliant vomitorium of viscera, a comic book with dreams of becoming a textbook for mad surgeons&quot;. James Berardinelli gave the film two and a half out of four stars: &quot;&quot;Blade II&quot; is for those undiscriminating movie-goers who want nothing more from a trip to the multiplex than loud, raucous, mindless entertainment&quot;.

===Accolades===
Like its predecessor, the film was nominated for both Best Horror Film and Best Make-up at the Saturn Awards.

==Video game==
A video game &quot;Blade II&quot; was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on September 3, 2002. Reviews were generally negative.

==Sequel==

<text>MUSIC-N refers to a family of computer music programs and programming languages descended from or influenced by MUSIC, a program written by Max Mathews in 1957 at Bell Labs. MUSIC was the first computer program for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis. It was one of the first programs for making music (in actuality, sound) on a digital computer, and was certainly the first program to gain wide acceptance in the music research community as viable for that task. The world&#x27;s first computer-controlled music was generated in Australia by programmer Geoff Hill on the CSIRAC computer which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. However, CSIRAC produced sound by sending raw pulses to the speaker, it did not produce standard digital audio with PCM samples, like the MUSIC-series of programs.

== Design ==
All MUSIC-N derivative programs have a (more-or-less) common design, made up of a library of functions built around simple signal-processing and synthesis routines (written as &quot;opcodes&quot; or unit generators). These simple opcodes are then constructed by the user into an instrument (usually through a text-based instruction file, but increasingly through a graphical interface) that defines a sound which is then &quot;played&quot; by a second file (called the score) which specifies notes, durations, pitches, amplitudes, and other parameters relevant to the musical informatics of the piece. Some variants of the language merge the instrument and score, though most still distinguish between control-level functions (which operate on the music) and functions that run at the sampling rate of the audio being generated (which operate on the sound). A notable exception is ChucK, which unifies audio-rate and control-rate timing into a single framework, allowing arbitrarily fine time granularity and also one mechanism to manage both. This has the advantage of more flexible and readable code as well as drawbacks of reduced system performance.

MUSIC-N and derived software are mostly available as complete self-contained programs, which can have different types of user-interfaces, from text- to GUI-based ones. In this aspect, Csound and RTcmix have since evolved to work effectively as software libraries which can be accessed through a variety of frontends and programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Tcl, Lua, Lisp,
Scheme, etc., as well as other music systems such as Pure Data, Max/MSP and plugin frameworks LADSPA and VST.

A number of highly original (and to this day largely unchallenged) assumptions are implemented in MUSIC and its descendants about the best way to create sound on a computer. Many of Mathews&#x27; implementations (such as using pre-calculated arrays for waveform and envelope storage, the use of a scheduler that runs in musical time rather than at audio rate) are the norm for most hardware and software synthesis and audio DSP systems today.

== Family ==
MUSIC included a number of variants, e.g.:

* MUSIC was developed by Mathews on an IBM 704 at Bell Labs in 1957 (this original version was later referred to as MUSIC I)
* MUSIC II was developed by Mathews on an IBM 7094 at Bell Labs in 1958
* MUSIC III was developed by Mathews on an IBM 7090 at Bell Labs in 1960
* MUSIC IV was developed by Mathews and J. Miller on an IBM 7094 at Bell Labs in 1963
: Derivatives of MUSIC IV include:
:* MUSIC IVB was developed by G. Winham and H. Howe on an IBM 7094 at Princeton University in 1965
::* MUSIC 4BF was developed by H. Howe and G. Winham on an IBM System/360 at Princeton University in 1967
::* MUSIC 360 was developed by Barry Vercoe on an IBM System/360 at Princeton University in 1969
::* MUSIC 11 was developed by B. Vercoe, S. Haflich, R. Hale, and C. Howe on a DEC PDP-11 at MIT in 1973
::* Csound (descended from MUSIC 11 and in wide use today)
:* MUS10 was developed by J. Chowning, D. Poole, and L. Smith on a DEC PDP-10 in Stanford University 1966
* MUSIC V was developed by Mathews and J. Miller on a GE 645 in 1966 at Bell Labs
: MUSIC V was considerably augmented at IRCAM in Paris by John Gardner and Jean-Louis Richer to enable it to process digitized sounds as well as to synthesize sounds
:* CMusic was developed by F. R. Moore and D. G. Loy on a DEC VAX-11 at UCSD in 1980
:* CMIX / Real-time Cmix was developed by Paul Lansky, Brad Garton, and others on an IBM System/370 at Princeton University starting in 1982

Structured Audio Orchestra Language (SAOL) is an imperative, MUSIC-N programming language, which is part of the MPEG-4 audio standard, by Eric Scheirer

Less obviously, MUSIC can be seen as the parent program for:

* RTSKED (a later RealTime Scheduling language by Max Mathews)
* Max/MSP
* Pure Data
* AudioMulch
* SuperCollider
* JSyn
* Common Lisp Music
* ChucK
* Any other computer synthesis language that relies on a modular system (e.g. Reaktor).

==MUSIC IV==
MUSIC IV was a computer music synthesis software package written by Max Mathews. The program was an expansion of earlier packages written by Mathews to produce music by direct digital computation, which could be heard by converting samples to audible sound using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). MUSIC IV was further expanded by Godfrey Winham and Hubert Howe into &quot;MUSIC IVB&quot;, and then into &quot;MUSIC IVBF&quot;, a more portable version written in FORTRAN. It is a precursor to CSound.

MUSIC IV allows the programmer to enter a musical score as a text file and have each note played with a particular &quot;musical instrument&quot;, which is a software algorithm. Some instruments are supplied in the package, but the programmer can supply new instruments in the form of FORTRAN code, to be compiled and called by the MUSIC IV package to generate output.

As designed, the package was not intended for real-time generation of music as is done by a modern portable electronic keyboard instrument; instead, entire songs or musical pieces are encoded and processed into a digital file on disk or tape containing the stream of samples. Prior to the advent of low-cost digital audio gear in the late 1980s, the samples were typically sent to a DAC and recorded on analog tape.
