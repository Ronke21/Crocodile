<text>is a village located in Kuma District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an estimated population of 937 in 466 households, and a population density of 3.7 persons per km2. The total area of the village is . The name of Itsuki is well known for an indigenous folksong &quot;Itsuki no Komoriuta&quot;, or &quot;Lullaby of Itsuki&quot;.

==Geography==
Itsuki is located in the southern part of Kumamoto Prefecture, in the northern part of Kuma District. The entire village is in the mountainous region of the Kyushu Mountains, so it is characterized by a series of mountains over 1,000 meters above sea level, very few flat areas, and steep terrain with deep gorges running vertically and horizontally. Approximately 96.2% of the total area is made up of forests. Almost all of the habitable areas in the village, including the urban center, are scheduled to be submerged by the Kawabegawa Dam, so alternative sites were built in various places and residents have been gradually relocated

=== Neighboring municipalities ===
Kumamoto Prefecture
* Mizukami
* Sagara
* Taragi
* Yamae
* Yatsushiro

===Climate===
Itsuki has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. 

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Itsuki is as shown below

==History==
The area of Itsuki was part of ancient Higo Province, During the Edo Period it was part of the holdings of Hitoyoshi Domain. After the Meiji restoration, the village of Itsuki was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. A plan for constructing Kawabegawa Dam was promulgated in 1966, but was delayed for decades due to extensive opposition by villagers and environmentalists. This project was cancelled in 2008, but only after most buildings and houses in the village were demolished and rebuilt on higher ground. However, after heavy rains in 2020 caused great damage in the Kuma River basin and other areas, the project was revived under the guise of &quot;flood control&quot;, with construction now scheduled to commence in 2027 with completion by 2035.

==Government==
Itsuki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of eight members. Itsuki, collectively with the other municipalities of Kuma District, contributes two members to the Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the village is part of the Kumamoto 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
The local economy is based on agriculture and forestry. Production of green tea is the primary crop.

==Education==
Itsuki has one public elementary school and one public junior high school operated by the village government, and one public high school operated by the Kumamoto Prefectural Bureau of Education.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Itsuki has no passenger railway services. The nearest train stations is Hitoyoshi Station on the Kumagawa Railway or JR Kyushu, approximately 45 minutes away by car or bus.

<doc id="468154" wikidata="Q417841" url="?curid=468154" title="Protein family">
<text>A protein family is a group of evolutionarily related proteins. In many cases, a protein family has a corresponding gene family, in which each gene encodes a corresponding protein with a 1:1 relationship. The term &quot;protein family&quot; should not be confused with family as it is used in taxonomy.

Proteins in a family descend from a common ancestor and typically have similar three-dimensional structures, functions, and significant sequence similarity. Sequence similarity (usually amino-acid sequence) is one of the most common indicators of homology, or common evolutionary ancestry. Some frameworks for evaluating the significance of similarity between sequences use sequence alignment methods. Proteins that do not share a common ancestor are unlikely to show statistically significant sequence similarity, making sequence alignment a powerful tool for identifying the members of protein families. Families are sometimes grouped together into larger clades called superfamilies based on structural similarity, even if there is no identifiable sequence homology.

Currently, over 60,000 protein families have been defined, although ambiguity in the definition of &quot;protein family&quot; leads different researchers to highly varying numbers.

==Terminology and usage==
The term protein family has broad usage and can be applied to large groups of proteins with barely detectable sequence similarity as well as narrow groups of proteins with near identical sequence, function, and structure. To distinguish between these cases, a hierarchical terminology is in use. At the highest level of classification are protein superfamilies, which group distantly related proteins, often based on their structural similarity. Next are protein families, which refer to proteins with a shared evolutionary origin exhibited by significant sequence similarity. Subfamilies can be defined within families to denote closely related proteins that have similar or identical functions. For example, a superfamily like the PA clan of proteases has less sequence conservation than the C04 family within it. 
==Protein domains and motifs==

Protein families were first recognised when most proteins that were structurally understood were small, single-domain proteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c. Since then, many proteins have been found with multiple independent structural and functional units called domains. Due to evolutionary shuffling, different domains in a protein have evolved independently. This has led to a focus on families of protein domains. Several online resources are devoted to identifying and cataloging these domains.

Different regions of a protein have differing functional constraints. For example, the active site of an enzyme requires certain amino-acid residues to be precisely oriented. A protein–protein binding interface may consist of a large surface with constraints on the hydrophobicity or polarity of the amino-acid residues. Functionally constrained regions of proteins evolve more slowly than unconstrained regions such as surface loops, giving rise to blocks of conserved sequence when the sequences of a protein family are compared (see multiple sequence alignment). These blocks are most commonly referred to as motifs, although many other terms are used (blocks, signatures, fingerprints, etc.). Several online resources are devoted to identifying and cataloging protein motifs.

==Evolution of protein families==
According to current consensus, protein families arise in two ways. First, the separation of a parent species into two genetically isolated descendant species allows a gene/protein to independently accumulate variations (mutations) in these two lineages. This results in a family of orthologous proteins, usually with conserved sequence motifs. Second, a gene duplication may create a second copy of a gene (termed a paralog). Because the original gene is still able to perform its function, the duplicated gene is free to diverge and may acquire new functions (by random mutation). 

Certain gene/protein families, especially in eukaryotes, undergo extreme expansions and contractions in the course of evolution, sometimes in concert with whole genome duplications. Expansions are less likely, and losses more likely, for intrinsically disordered proteins and for protein domains whose hydrophobic amino acids are further from the optimal degree of dispersion along the primary sequence. This expansion and contraction of protein families is one of the salient features of genome evolution, but its importance and ramifications are currently unclear.
==Use and importance of protein families==
As the total number of sequenced proteins increases and interest expands in proteome analysis, an effort is ongoing to organize proteins into families and to describe their component domains and motifs. Reliable identification of protein families is critical to phylogenetic analysis, functional annotation, and the exploration of the diversity of protein function in a given phylogenetic branch. The Enzyme Function Initiative uses protein families and superfamilies as the basis for development of a sequence/structure-based strategy for large scale functional assignment of enzymes of unknown function. The algorithmic means for establishing protein families on a large scale are based on a notion of similarity.

==Protein family resources==
Many biological databases catalog protein families and allow users to match query sequences to known families. These include:
* Pfam - Protein families database of alignments and HMMs
* PROSITE - Database of protein domains, families and functional sites
* PIRSF - SuperFamily Classification System
* PASS2 - Protein Alignment as Structural Superfamilies v2 - PASS2@NCBS
* SUPERFAMILY - Library of HMMs representing superfamilies and database of (superfamily and family) annotations for all completely sequenced organisms
* SCOP and CATH - Classifications of protein structures into superfamilies, families and domains

Similarly, many database-searching algorithms exist, for example:
* BLAST - DNA sequence similarity search
* BLASTp - Protein sequence similarity search
* OrthoFinder - Method for clustering proteins into families (orthogroups)

The average annual rainfall is 2259 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.2 °C, and lowest in January, at around 7.8 °C.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Reihoku is as shown below

==History==
The area of Reihoku was part of ancient Higo Province, and contained the stronghold of the Shiki clan, who dominated the area from the Kamakura period to the Sengoku period. During the Edo Period it was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate and administered from the office of the Nagasaki bugyō, and it remained the de facto center of the Amakusa region. After the Meiji restoration, the town of Tomioka, and villages of Sakasegawa, Shiki and Toro were established in Amakusa District, Kumamoto with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On January1, 1955, Tomioka merged with Sakasegawa and Shiki to form the town of Reihoku. The village of Toro was incorporated into Reihoku on September 30, 1956.

==Government==
Reihoku has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of ten members. Reihoku, together with the city of Amakusa contributes three members to the Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Kumamoto 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
Since the Edo period, Reihoku has been known as a producer of Amakusa kaolinite, a raw material for porcelain, and quarrying remains a major component of the local economy. The town was also known for its coal mining, with some of the mine shafts extending below sea level. On February 20, 1954, an accident occurred at the Shiki coal mine when an excavation error caused seawater to flow into the tunnels, killing 36 people. By the 1960s, most of the mines had closed, but in the 1990s, the Kyushu Electric Power Reihoku Thermal Power Plant, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired power station was built on the west coast, and its output is enough to cover about two-thirds of the electricity demand in Kumamoto Prefecture. As a result, the town&#x27;s finances were strong and it was not merged into Amakusa City.

==Education==
Reihoku has four public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Kumamoto Prefectural Board of Education. 

==Transportation==

<doc id="468174" wikidata="Q4739177" url="?curid=468174" title="Amakusa, Kumamoto (town)">
<text>was a town located in Amakusa District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,405 and a density of 51.54 persons per km2. The total area was 85.46 km2.

On March 27, 2006, Amakusa absorbed the cities of Hondo and Ushibuka, the towns of Ariake, Goshoura, Itsuwa, Kawaura, Kuratake, Shinwa and Sumoto (all from Amakusa District) to create the city of Amakusa. &quot;Amakusa City&quot; refers to this union of six towns and two cities, while &quot;Amakusa Town&quot; or &quot;Amakusa-machi&quot; refers to the one town of those six.

Amakusa-machi consists of five hamlets, four spread along the west coast of Shimo-shima and one located in the mountains between the coast and Hondo, the administrative capital of Amakusa City. They are, in order of geographic location starting from the south, Ōe (大江), Takahama (高浜), Shimoda-minami (下田南), Shimoda-kita (下田北), and Fukuregi (福連木). 

Amakusa-machi is famous for its scenic coastline along the Amakusa-nada sea, including a natural, white sandy beach in Takahama called Shiratsuru-hama 白鶴浜 and beautiful, strange rock formations in the bay Myoken-ura 妙見浦. Shimoda-kita is also home to a famous hot spring which, according to legend, was discovered by a white heron. Many tourists come to Amakusa-machi to enjoy these leisure spots.

The village of Ōe, along with the Sakitsu in Kawaura-machi to the south, were both visited by Christian missionaries in the wake of St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s mission to Japan in 1549. Many were converted and kept their faith even during the periods of harsh persecution and the Shimabara rebellion. The Romanesque-style church in Ōe and the gothic-style church in Sakitsu have both become symbols of Amakusa&#x27;s Christian history, and are visited by many throughout the year. Museums located in both Kawaura and Ōe exhibit various artifacts from the time of Christian persecution that show how the Japanese Christians of that time kept their faith. 

Between the five villages of the town, there used to be as many as five elementary schools, four junior high schools, and one high school, with the total junior high school population reaching as high as 800 students. A steep decline in the population has reduced the elementary and junior high schools to one each, both located in Takahama. The junior high school student population is around 75, while the total elementary school population is around 115. The high school, also located in Takahama, is closing in March 2015.

<text>Dudley Francis Stuart Ryder, 3rd Earl of Harrowby (16 January 183126 March 1900), known as Viscount Sandon from 1847 to 1882, was a British peer and politician.

==Life==
He was the second son and eventual heir of Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby, and Lady Frances Stuart, fourth daughter of John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute.
He was born at Brighton on 16 January 1831. 
He was educated at Harrow and the university of Oxford, where he matriculated from Christ Church on 31 May 1849, graduated B.A. in 1853, and proceeded M.A. in 1878.

On leaving the university, Viscount Sandon, as he was styled during his father&#x27;s lifetime, made a tour in the East with Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, visiting Syria and the Lebanon (see Carnavon&#x27;s &quot;Recollections of the Druses of the Lebanon&quot;, London, 1860, 8vo). 
On his return to England, he did garrison duty as captain in the 2nd Staffordshire militia regiment, during the Crimean War and Indian mutiny.

==Political career==

Harrowby was Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield from 1856 to 1859 and for Liverpool from 1868 until he succeeded to the peerage in 1882. 
He gained experience of affairs as private secretary to Henry Labouchere at the colonial office.

He was a member of the select committees on the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (1857) and the Euphrates Valley (1871–72), and continued throughout life to devote much time and attention to the study of imperial and colonial questions. 
He was Vice-President of the Committee on Education from 1874 to 1878, and President of the Board of Trade (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1878 to 1880 in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s second administration and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1874. 
Between 1885 and 1886, he served as Lord Privy Seal in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first government.

Apart from his career in national politics he was also Chairman of the Staffordshire county council and a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for that county.

He died at Sandon Hall, Staffordshire, on 26 March 1900.

==Family==
Lord Harrowby married Lady Mary Cecil, daughter of Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter, in 1861. The marriage was childless. Harrowby died in March 1900, aged 69, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry. 
Lady Harrowby died in July 1917.

<doc id="468180" wikidata="Q895519" url="?curid=468180" title="Box Hill, Surrey">
<text>Box Hill is a summit of the North Downs in Surrey, approximately south-west of London. It is named after the ancient box woodland found on the steepest west-facing chalk slopes overlooking the River Mole. The western part of the hill is owned and managed by the National Trust, whilst the village of Box Hill lies on higher ground to the east. The highest point is Betchworth Clump at above OD, although the Salomons Memorial (at 172 metres) overlooking the town of Dorking is the most popular viewpoint.

Box Hill is part of the Surrey Hills National Landscape and forms part of the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest. The north- and south-facing slopes support an area of chalk downland, noted for its orchids and other rare plant species. The hill provides a habitat for 38 species of butterfly, and has given its name to a species of squash bug, now found throughout south-east England.

An estimated 850,000 people visit Box Hill each year. The National Trust visitors&#x27; centre provides both a cafeteria and gift shop, and panoramic views of the western Weald may be enjoyed from the North Downs Way, a long-distance footpath that runs along the south-facing scarp slope. Box Hill featured prominently on the route of the 2012 Summer Olympics cycling road race events.

==Geography==

Box Hill, approximately south-west of central London, stands at the south-eastern corner of the Mole Gap, the valley carved by the River Mole through the North Downs. Its summit, above Ordnance Datum, is the 12th highest in Surrey. The western boundary of the hill is defined by the River Mole, which has cut a steep cliff, exposing the chalk bedrock. The Vale of Holmesdale lies immediately to the south, below the scarp slope. The northern and eastern boundaries are defined by dry river valleys, which were created during the last Ice Age. The total area of the hill is approximately , of which half is owned by the National Trust.

==The village==
The village of Box Hill is to the east of the summit and to the west of the Country Park owned by the National Trust. The earliest flint cottages date from the 1800s, although much of the village was constructed in the first half of the 20th century. By 2005 there were more than 800 dwellings, of which over five hundred were mobile homes. An estimated 41% of the community is aged 60 or over. St Andrew&#x27;s Church, part of the ecclesiastical parish of Headley, was consecrated in 1969 and the village hall opened in 1974. The village is not part of a civil parish.

==History==

===Early history===

Two Bronze Age round barrows, located close to the Salomons Memorial, provide the earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on Box Hill. The larger barrow is in diameter and high and, in medieval times, was used as a boundary marker or &quot;mere&quot; for the parish of Mickleham. Traces of prehistoric field boundaries are visible on Burford Spur and the low flint banks on the steeper and more wooded White Hill may be contemporaneous.

An ancient trackway along the North Downs escarpment can be dated to around 600–450 BC, but has probably been in existence since the Stone Age and may have crossed the River Mole at a ford close to the location of the present day stepping stones. In Victorian times this route was dubbed the Pilgrims&#x27; Way and was supposedly followed by visitors to the shrines of Thomas Becket and Swithun at Canterbury and Winchester respectively.

Stane Street was constructed by the Romans in around 60–70 AD to link London (Londinium) to Chichester (Noviomagus Reginorum) on the south coast of England. The course of the road runs in a southwesterly direction across Mickleham Downs, before turning south to cross the River Mole at a ford close to the site of the Burford Bridge Hotel. A hoard of nine Roman coins, including bronze &quot;folles&quot; dating from the reigns of Diocletian, Maximian and Constantius I, was discovered on Box Hill close to Broadwood&#x27;s Folly in 1979.

===Medieval and early modern periods===
The pillow mounds to the north-east of the Salomons Memorial are thought to date from the medieval period and were probably constructed as artificial warrens for rabbits. High Ashurst warren is recorded as remaining in use until the late 18th century. A second warren was probably situated close to Warren Farm in the Headley Valley and it has been speculated that the present farmhouse was originally the warrener&#x27;s cottage.
The origin of the box trees growing on the hill is disputed. Several sources from the late 18th century suggest that they were planted by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel during the reign of Charles I. However Howard never owned the Box Hill estate and older medieval documents make reference to local individuals with surnames including &quot;Atteboxe&quot;, &quot;de la Boxe&quot; and &quot;Buxeto&quot;, suggesting that the trees were already common in the area by the 13th century. The diarist John Evelyn records a visit to the hill in August 1655 to view &quot;those natural bowers, cabinets and shady walks in the box copses.&quot;

The close grain of the box wood made it highly prized for its timber for carving and there are numerous accounts of the sale of trees from the hill throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. At the end of the eighteenth century, imports from Portugal reduced the market value of box wood and commercial exploitation of timber from Box Hill appears to have ended with a final sale in 1797.

===Agriculture===
Despite the commercial importance of timber in the early modern period, the woodland on Box Hill was much less extensive at the start of the 19th century than at the start of the 21st. The 1801 Betchworth Estate Map shows that there was a network of irregularly shaped fields on the top of the hill, where the more fertile clay-with-flints overlays the chalk. These ‘clearings’ (each up to ) were cultivated for arable crops, but by the 1830s changes in farming practices meant that they were too small to be worked economically and many were over-planted with beech (with some oak). These deciduous plantations may be distinguished from older yew- and box-dominated woodland on the hill by the uniform age of the trees.

Remnants of a few of these arable fields still exist, notably at the head of Juniper Bottom and around the old Box Hill Fort and Swiss Cottage. The Donkey Green (immediately north of the Salomons Memorial) was used as a cricket ground in the 1850s. It acquired its current name in Edwardian times, when donkey rides were offered to younger day trippers, although this practice had ceased by World War II.

The soil covering the north- and south-facing chalk slopes of the hill is too thin and insufficiently fertile to allow cultivation. These areas are indicated as &quot;sheep-walk&quot; on the 1801 map and were used as pasture, especially during the winter months when lower ground was too wet for productive grazing. Grazing of these slopes has continued into the 21st century and a herd of Belted Galloway cattle is used by both Surrey Wildlife Trust and the National Trust to control growth of grasses, thereby allowing wild flowers (including orchids) to flourish.
Throughout its history, Headley Heath has been used for grazing and local villagers have collected heather, gorse and turf for bedding and making fires. Although most Rights of Common connected with the heath were abolished by Act of Parliament in 1965, the inhabitants of one nearby cottage still have the right to graze geese.

===Ownership and public access===
The hill was purchased by Thomas Hope, shortly before his death in 1831. (Hope was the owner of The Deepdene, the mansion to the east of Dorking.) The Mickleham Parish Records credit Hope&#x27;s widow, Louisa de la Poer Beresford (whom he had married six years previously), with allowing &quot;free access to the beauties of this hill&quot;, however day-trippers had been arriving in significant numbers for more than a century before that.

Developments in local transport infrastructure over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, enabled increasing numbers to visit the area. Following the completion of the turnpike road between Leatherhead and Dorking in 1750, stagecoaches stopped regularly at the Burford Bridge Hotel. As late as 1879, a daily coach ran non-stop to Box Hill from Piccadilly with a journey time of 2.5 hours.

The South Eastern Railway opened the first railway station in Dorking in 1849, followed by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), which opened the station in the village of Westhumble in 1867. The LBSCR ran dedicated excursion trains to Box Hill on Bank Holiday weekends and over 1300 day-trippers were recorded arriving at Westhumble station on 6 August 1883.
The proposals for a land value tax outlined by Chancellor David Lloyd George in his People&#x27;s Budget of 1909 prompted the trustees of the Deepdene estate to start to sell the unimproved land on the western side of Box Hill. As a result of negotiations led by Sir Robert Hunter, Leopold Salomons of Norbury Park purchased of Box Hill in 1913 for £16,000. The following year, Salomons donated the land, which included the Old Fort, Swiss Cottage and the western flank of the hill above the River Mole, to the National Trust.

Two further purchases of and transferred Lodge Hill and Ashurst Rough to National Trust ownership in 1921 and 1923. Following World War II, National Trust acquired Headley Heath, a geologically distinct area of heathland which lies to the north-east of Box Hill village, the majority of which was given as a single donation in 1946. The Trust continued to purchase land, and by the mid-1980s the estate comprised some . The most recent additions to the Box Hill Estate include farmland at Westhumble and at the foot of the hill, purchased in the late 1990s.

===Military history===
In the latter half of the 19th century, growing public concern over the ability of the British armed forces to repel an invasion (stoked, in part, by the serialisation of George Tomkyns Chesney&#x27;s 1871 novella The Battle of Dorking), prompted the government to announce the construction of thirteen fortified mobilisation centres, collectively known as the London Defence Positions. Two centres were built on Box Hill, approximately apart: one close to the present National Trust visitor centre (commonly called Box Hill Fort) and the other close to the summit of the hill, to the south of the present day Box Hill village (known as Betchworth Fort).

The sites were purchased from the trustees of the Hope estate by the Ministry of Defence in 1891, and construction began in 1899. The two centres were laid out in the form of infantry redoubts typical of the period, but also included magazines (partially below ground level) for the storage of shells and cartridges. (In common with the majority of the eleven other mobilisation centres, the forts were designed for the use of the infantry only and the stored ammunition was intended for the use of mobile field artillery which would be deployed nearby as required.) The main flat-roofed buildings were built in brick and reinforced concrete and were protected from artillery fire by crescent-shaped earth blast banks, surrounded by an outer ditch.

A reform of defence policy by the Secretary of War Viscount Haldane in 1905 resulted in all 13 centres being declared redundant, and both forts were sold back to the estate trustees in 1908. Both forts are protected by a Scheduled Monument listing. The National Trust owns the Box Hill Fort and a metal grill has been placed over the entrance to allow bats to access to their roosts. The Betchworth Fort is in private ownership and is not accessible to the public.
During World War II, the River Mole comprised part of the fortified GHQ Line B. This defensive line ran along the North Downs from Farnham via Guildford to Dorking, before following the river to Horley. Between Betchworth and Box Hill, the north bank of the River Mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing. At Boxhill Farm, where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows, a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure. Gun mounts were also installed to protect both Boxhill and Deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were constructed. The Stepping Stones at the foot of the hill were removed as an anti-invasion measure.

From 1940, Headley Court was used as the Headquarters for the VII Corps and later for the Canadian Corps and Canadian troops were billeted at High Ashurst. Bellasis House was used as training centre both for Czech agents of the Special Operations Executive and for German Prisoners of War. In preparation for D-Day, Headley Heath was used for tank and combat training by the Canadian armed forces, and the area known as The Pyramids is named after the piles of ammunition that they kept on the heath. Betchworth Quarry was used by the British Army in early 1944, to test the firing capabilities of Churchill tanks.

==Geology==
===Rock types===

The chalk which comprises the majority of Box Hill (and the rest of the North Downs), has its origins in the late Cretaceous (approximately 100 – 66 million years ago). For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which coccolithophores, single-celled algae with small calcite skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today.

Overlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of clay-with-flints. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by cryoturbation and decalcification of the chalk. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.

The sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the Quaternary. The sand and gravels found in this area, indicate the presence of the sea shore. On Headley Heath, these deposits are thin and the chalk also comes to the surface in several places, allowing acid-loving plants to thrive alongside those that prefer alkaline conditions, producing the rare chalk heath habitat.

===Wealden uplift and erosion of the North Downs escarpment===
Following the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern day south Surrey, south Kent and north Sussex) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs (including the Mole, Wey, Arun and Adur). The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs and the Greensand Ridge.

Chalk is a relatively soft rock that may be eroded or weathered in a number of different ways. It is porous, able to absorb up to 20% of its dry weight in water, and therefore highly susceptible to weathering by freeze-thaw action, which may occur over repeated annual or diurnal cycles. This frost weathering produces a mix of rubble and viscous mud, which may be washed downhill, further eroding the landscape (a process known as solifluction). At the west side of Box Hill, the hydraulic action of the River Mole has cut a cliff known as The Whites and the river bed contains coarse chalk rubble (clast), which has fallen from the steep slopes above. Since the chalk contains a very high percentage of calcium carbonate, it can be dissolved by ground water and solubilisation of the rock at the base of the hill may have produced the slabwise slumping or subsidence visible at the top of the Burford Spur. Finally, rainwater, which is mildly acidic, will dissolve and react with the chalk.
The eastern and northern boundaries of Box Hill are defined by dry river valleys, now occupied by Pebblehill Road and Headley Lane respectively. These valleys were active during the last ice age, when the chalk bedrock became frozen and impermeable, forcing water to run over the surface in streams rather than percolating into the ground. Both valleys are narrow, twisting and deep, suggesting that they were created by fast flowing torrents, possibly released during periods of rapid snowmelt.

The northern side of Box Hill (corresponding to the dip slope of the cuesta of the North Downs) is cut by six combes, also created by Ice Age watercourses. The westernmost of these combes (between the Burford Spur and Lodge Hill) is climbed by the Zig Zag Road. There is a small reservoir to the west of High Ashurst at the base of the Bullen Wood combe, which is not accessible to the public. All six combes contained tributaries of the stream that created the Headley Valley, which joined the River Mole near Fredley, Mickleham.

===Quarries and lime kilns===

Chalk and flint have been quarried from Box Hill and the surrounding area for many centuries. There are limited surviving examples of the incorporation of chalk blocks (or clunch) into the stonework of local buildings (including Mickleham Church). Walls made of flints, bound together by lime mortar, are particularly common in Surrey and quicklime could be produced with relative ease, by heating chalk above in a kiln.

Evidence remains of the small-scale chalk quarrying that occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution, including chalk pits both at Warren Farm and close to the Burford Bridge Hotel. The opening of the Dorking to Reigate railway line at the bottom of the hill in 1849, enabled new quarry faces to be opened at Brockham and Betchworth. Sidings were provided adjacent to the main line and there was an extensive network of narrow-gauge railway tracks at both sites. The Brockham Limeworks closed in 1935, however a battery of eight kilns (dating from 1870) still stands and is Grade II listed. The larger Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns (approximately 1 km to the east) closed in 1960 and a variety of different kiln types have been preserved and protected with a Grade II listing. The two sites have been designated as Nature Reserves and are managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust. A wide range of bat species now roost in the former kilns.

Gravel was quarried on the northern side of Headley Heath during the 18th and early 19th centuries, most likely to provide material for building local roads.

===Fossils===
Numerous fossils, typical of species living in a warm, shallow sea, have been found in the chalk at Box Hill, including brachiopods (&quot;Terebratulina gracilis&quot;, &quot;Terebratulina carnea&quot; and &quot;Rhynchonella cuvieri&quot;), arthropods (&quot;Janira quinquecostatus&quot;), bivalves (&quot;Spondylus spinosus&quot; and &quot;Ostrea hippodium&quot;), urchins (&quot;Holaster planus&quot;, &quot;Micraster leskei&quot;) and sponges (&quot;Plinthosella squamata&quot;).

==Ecology==
===Conservation===

Box Hill is part of the Surrey Hills National Landscape. The vast majority of the publicly accessible areas of the hill that are managed by the National Trust and Surrey Wildlife Trust, form part of the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest and have been designated a Special Area of Conservation.

The chalk downland of Box Hill provides a habitat for a wide range of plant species, which in turn support a varied population of insect species. The alkaline soils are thin and nutrient poor, which prevents deeper-rooted lush grasses (with a high water demand) from dominating. Each square metre of chalk downland may support up to 40 different species.

Without careful management, the grassland would revert to woodland and so these areas of the hill are grazed in order to prevent scrub from becoming overestablished. Both the National Trust and Surrey Wildlife Trust use Belted Galloway cattle (affectionately nicknamed &#x27;Belties&#x27;), which crop the grass less hard than other grazers and allow the more delicate wild flowers (including orchids) to flourish. At Betchworth Quarry, Surrey Wildlife Trust allows goats to graze, which can eat woodier plants such as gorse and bramble. Rabbits also make a significant contribution to the control of scrub and coarse grasses on the hill, although their numbers have declined since the introduction of myxomatosis in 1953.
For any conservation area, it is important to find a balance between the interests of people visiting and the needs of the wildlife that it seeks to protect. After the announcement that the Olympic cycling road races would be routed over the hill, concerns were expressed that habitats would be damaged during the event. Scrub clearance along the side of the Zig Zag Road to provide space for spectators began in January 2012, after a pre-race survey (commissioned by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) showed that the work was likely to increase biodiversity. A second ecological survey, performed after the Games, showed that no significant damage had occurred, although some areas were subsequently reseeded.

===Biodiversity===

The chalk downland environment supports notable populations of bats, lepidopterans, orchids and the hill&#x27;s namesake, the box tree (&quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot;).

====Orchids====
A large number of species of orchid have been recorded on Box Hill, including autumn lady&#x27;s-tresses, bee orchids, bird&#x27;s-nest orchids, broad-leaved helleborines, common spotted orchids, common twayblades, fragrant orchids, pyramidal orchids and white helleborines.

====Other wild flowers====
Wild garlic grows alongside bluebells under the tree canopy beside the River Mole at the western edge of the hill, giving the area its distinctive smell in springtime.

====Aquatic plants====
&quot;Damasonium alisma&quot; (starfruit) was reintroduced to Headley Heath in 2013 using seeds from the Millennium Seed Bank, having been absent since 2000. It is now found in Brimmer Pond (half of which is enclosed to prevent habitat disturbance by dogs) and also in Heath House Pond.

====Trees====

The box and yew woodland, on the steep-sloping sides of the hill above the River Mole, is of international importance. Common canopy-layer species include beech, ash and oak. Understorey species include holly, hazel, elder and honeysuckle.

Invasive species found on the hill include buddleia, cherry laurel, Japanese knot weed and Canadian goldenrod. Boxwood blight, a fungal disease caused by &quot;Cylindrocladium buxicola&quot;, is widespread.

====Bats====
Several abandoned brick and concrete structures provide habitats for bats and grills have been placed over their entrances to protect the roosting sites. Three species are known to inhabit the old Box Hill Fort: the brown long-eared bat, the noctule bat and Natterer&#x27;s bat. The brown long-eared bat, Natterer&#x27;s bat, the whiskered bat and Daubenton&#x27;s bat have been recorded at both Betchworth and Brockham quarries. Brandt&#x27;s bat has been recorded at Betchworth; Bechstein&#x27;s bat and the common pipistrelle have been recorded at Brockham.

====Butterflies and moths====
Box Hill supports 38 different species of butterflies. Species include silver-spotted skipper, Adonis blue and chalkhill blue (grassland); brown hairstreak (scrub); purple emperor and white admiral (woodland). The small pearl-bordered fritillary was present on the hill in the 1970s, but has not been recorded locally since 1997.

Kidney vetch, growing in the Zig Zag Valley and below the Viewpoint, supports populations of the small blue. To create new habitats for the butterflies, a number of ‘scrapes’ were excavated in the late 2010s, exposing bare chalk on which vetch can become established with minimal competition. Buddleia removal was also initiated as part of the same programme.

Rare moth species found on the hill include the straw belle, chalk carpet, lace border, orange-tailed clearwing and the Surrey midget moth.

====Other insects====
The hill has given its name to a species of squash bug, now found throughout south-east England.

==Recreation==
===Box Hill Country Park===
The western part of Box Hill, managed by the National Trust, was designated a Country Park in 1971 and some of the outbuildings associated with the Box Hill Fort are in use as a visitor centre, gift shop and servery. In 2011, a &quot;Natural Play Trail&quot; was constructed close to the visitor centre, cofunded by the National Trust and the Friends of Box Hill.

On the hill there are car parks and a panoramic view over the Weald towards the South Downs may be enjoyed from the Salomons Memorial (more commonly known as the viewpoint). Juniper Top, on the northern side of the hill, offers views to the northwest towards Windsor Castle.

The Country Park is crisscrossed by a large number of footpaths and bridleways, and there are several signposted, self-guided trails.

===Cycling===
Box Hill has been popular with cyclists since the 1880s and by the 1890s, Dorking Cycle Club was organising camps for amateur cyclists from across the south east of England. The 2012 Summer Olympic cycling road races included mid-race circuits of Box Hill. An estimated 15,000 spectators travelled to the hill on 28 July 2012 to watch the men&#x27;s race, which included nine circuits and the following day, competitors in the women&#x27;s race climbed Box Hill twice.

The Box Hill Olympic circuit is generally cycled in an anticlockwise direction and begins to the south of the village of Mickleham with an ascent of the hill via the Zig Zag Road. From the National Trust Visitor Centre, the route turns eastwards, running along the escarpment and through the urban area of Box Hill village, reaching a maximum elevation of above Ordnance Datum. After the route turns northwest along the B2033, passing through the village of Headley. After , the circuit begins a continuous descent to the valley of the River Mole, passing to the south of Leatherhead, before turning southwards again through Mickleham to return to the start.

The Zig Zag Road is a steady climb of over and has, although on a much smaller scale, been likened to the Alpe d&#x27;Huez in the French Alps. The exact date of construction is uncertain: The road first appears on the Ordnance Survey map of 1869, but is not shown in a watercolour painting dated 1861 by William Leighton Leitch, which is owned by the Royal Collection. The Zig Zag Road is not a public right of way and is closed for one day each year by the National Trust, to preserve its private road status.

As part of the 2011 London Prepares series, the London–Surrey Cycle Classic for professional cyclists was organised to test the Olympic course. The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 and London–Surrey Classic, for amateur and professional cyclists respectively, have taken place annually following the Games and, although the course has undergone several alterations from the 2012 Olympic course, the two races always include a climb of Box Hill.

===High Ashurst===

High Ashurst is an outdoor education and activity centre on the northern side of Box Hill, adjacent to Headley Heath. The centre is run by Surrey Outdoor Learning and Development on behalf of Surrey County Council. Previously the site comprised the grounds of a country house, which was demolished in the 1970s, having been derelict for several decades.

===Boidier Hurst campsite===
The District Scout Associations of Leatherhead and Epsom and Ewell own a campsite, located between Box Hill village and Headley Heath. There are 11 areas for pitching groups of tents, set within coppiced chestnut woodland. Washing, toilet facilities and a kitchen are available. Use of Boidier Hurst is restricted to members of The Scout Association, The Guide Association and to local school groups on Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award expeditions.

==Points of interest==
===Betchworth Clump===
The highest point on Box Hill is immediately to the east of Box Hill village at above OD. The area is known as Betchworth Clump after a distinctive group of beech trees, which were present at the start of the 20th century. Today, the dense woodland at the summit conceals a water tower and transmitter mast, neither of which are accessible to the public.

The concrete water tower was built in 1930 by East Surrey Water, the forerunner of SES Water. The structure was refurbished in 2009 to extend its working life by at least 25 years; modifications included the relining of the water bowl, repair of cracks in the walls and roof, as well as the provision of a new access staircase.

The 30m-high mobile phone mast was constructed in 2003 and is operated by Vodafone and EE Limited.

===Broadwood&#x27;s Folly===

The circular flint tower located on the northern tip of Lodge Hill was built for the piano maker Thomas Broadwood, who purchased Juniper Hall in 1815. It is approximately high and originally had two internal floors, linked by a spiral staircase. The original doorway is visible on the east side, but has been sealed with rough flints. An avenue of beech trees linked the folly to Juniper Hall, although these were destroyed by the Great Storm of 1987. The tower may have been built to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo.

A sparkling wine, produced by Denbies Wine Estate for the Lidl supermarket chain, has been named after the folly.

===Labilliere&#x27;s grave===
Peter Labilliere was born in Dublin on 30 May 1725 to a family of French Huguenot descent. He joined the British Army at the age of 14, becoming a major in 1760. After leaving the army he became a political agitator and was accused in 1775 of bribing British troops not to fight in the American War of Independence, although he was never tried for treason.

After moving to Dorking in around 1789, Labilliere often visited Box Hill to meditate. With old age he became increasingly eccentric and neglected his own personal hygiene to such an extent that he acquired the nickname &quot;the walking dung-hill&quot;. He died on 6 June 1800. In accordance with his wishes he was buried head downwards, on 11 June on the western side of Box Hill above The Whites. In the presence of a crowd of thousands that included visitors from London as well as the local &quot;quality gentry&quot;, Labilliere was buried without any religious ceremony, having reportedly said that the world was &quot;topsy-turvey&quot; and that it would be righted in the end if he were interred thus. However, in his &quot;Book of Devotions&quot;, he wrote that he wished to emulate the example of St Peter, who was crucified upside-down according to tradition.

The current memorial stone on Box Hill is not believed to mark the exact location of his burial (which is thought to be several metres to the west on a steep incline). There are two errors on the stone itself: He was buried in &quot;June&quot; 1800 (rather than July) and all surviving manuscripts indicate that he spelt his name Labilliere (rather than Labelliere).

===Weypole and Stepping Stones===

The &quot;Weypole&quot; (or &quot;Waypole&quot;) is a roughly semi-circular area of level ground at the foot of Box Hill, between The Whites and the River Mole. The area was originally part of the grounds of Burford Lodge, built by John Eckersall in 1776, and the apple and cherry trees in the area suggest that it was used as an orchard for a time. The Burford Lodge estate was later owned by the horticulturalist Sir Trevor Lawrence, who created a garden along the banks of the Mole for his collection of orchids.

A ford across the River Mole is thought to have existed here since prehistoric times. The &quot;way-pole&quot; was a notched post, secured in the riverbed, that indicated the depth of the water. Stepping stones at this site are first recorded in 1841 and they may have been installed by an owner of Burford Lodge to facilitate access to the Weypole orchard. The crossing was formally reopened on 11 September 1946 by Prime Minister Clement Attlee, at the request of James Chuter Ede, local politician and Attlee&#x27;s Home Secretary. The new stones replaced those removed during World War II as an anti-invasion measure.

The spot is popular with both anglers and families, although swimming is strongly discouraged. The stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of Westhumble.

===Other===
The Burford Bridge Hotel and Juniper Hall Field Studies Centre lie at the foot of Box Hill close to the river Mole. Both are rich in historical associations with famous visitors and residents.

==Notable former residents==
===John Logie Baird===
John Logie Baird (1888-1946), the inventor of the first working television system, lived at Box Hill from 1929 until 1932. He had first demonstrated the new technology in early 1926, and continued with his work when he moved to Swiss Cottage on the top of the hill. He installed a small-scale electricity generating plant in a purpose-built outbuilding, to provide electrical power for his experiments, which included test transmissions to the roof of the Red Lion pub in Dorking High Street. He also demonstrated his Noctovisor, an infrared viewing device, which was designed to enable ships to see each other at night or in fog.

Swiss Cottage was built in the mid-19th century and is protected by a Grade II listing. It is not accessible to the public.

===Brodie family===
Brockham Warren was the family seat of the Brodie baronets. Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet (1783-1862) was a physiologist and surgeon, who performed pioneering research into bone and joint diseases. He served as sergeant-surgeon to both William IV and subsequently Queen Victoria. He was made a baronet in 1834 and was President of the Royal Society from 1858 to 1861. His son, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Baronet (1817-1880), was a Chemistry Professor at Oxford University from 1865 to 1872, and is chiefly known for his investigations into the allotropic states of carbon and for his discovery of graphitic acid.

===George Meredith===

The author George Meredith (1828-1909) lived in Flint Cottage from 1868 until his death. He built a chalet in the garden in which he wrote. Today the house is protected by a Grade II listing and is not accessible to the public.

Among several works written at Box Hill, Meredith&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot;, published in 1881, inspired Ralph Vaughan Williams to compose the musical work of the same name. A second poem, &quot;&quot; (published in 1883 as part of a collection entitled &quot;Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth&quot;), is said to have been inspired by the part of Box Hill known as Juniper Bottom or Happy Valley.

The part of the hill immediately opposite the cottage is known as &quot;Barrie&#x27;s Bank&quot;, because the author J. M. Barrie supposedly waited there, while summoning the courage to introduce himself to Meredith.

===E. F. Warburg===
The botanist Edmund Frederic (&quot;Heff&quot;) Warburg (1908-1966) grew up at Boidier, a house close to the southeastern corner of Headley Heath. His father was a keen gardener and had assembled a large collection of exotic plants at the family home. Heff became reader in plant taxonomy at Oxford University and was a fellow of New College.

His mother, Lady Warburg, gave the land for Boidier Hurst Camp Site to the District Scout Associations of Leatherhead and Epsom and Ewell in 1946 and her family donated the neighbouring, Heath Plantation to the National Trust following her death in 1952.

===Edvard Westermarck===

The Finnish philosopher and sociologist Edvard Westermarck (1862-1939) rented Keeper&#x27;s Cottage as his summer residence between 1910 and 1927.

==Registered charities==
The National Trust owns around half of the land on Box Hill (principally the Country Park in the west and Headley Heath in the north-east). Surrey Wildlife Trust manage Brockham Limeworks (owned by Surrey County Council) as well as Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns (privately owned). Both Trusts rely on the support of volunteer groups, working alongside paid employees, to carry out conservation and education work.

The &quot;Friends of Box Hill&quot; (FoBH) is a local organisation, which supports the National Trust in its work in the Country Park. Several of its members advise the Trust on its wildlife management plans and the FoBH also fund specific projects, including the purchase of equipment and improvement of visitor facilities. They also organise a programme of social events, which includes regular talks by Trust staff.

The &quot;Friends of Headley Heath&quot; (FoHH) coordinate volunteer working parties to assist National Trust Rangers and also run a series of social events.

(Both the FoBH and FoHH are independent of the National Trust.)

==Transport links==
===Public transport===
 is the closest railway station to the National Trust Country Park (approximately 500 m) and is served by trains from both London Victoria and London Waterloo. Both and Dorking (Main) stations are around 1 km from the south western corner of the hill. station is at the south eastern corner of the hill.
Box Hill is served by local and London bus routes.

===Access for motor vehicles===
Access to the National Trust Country Park from the A24 dual carriageway is via the B2209 and the Zig Zag Road, however this route is not suitable for buses or coaches. Alternative access is via the B2033 and Boxhill Road, which leads through Box Hill village and approaches the Country Park from the west. Headley Heath is directly accessible from the B2033.

===Cycle routes===
National Cycle Route 22 runs along the northern boundary of the hill via Lodgebottom Road and Headley Lane, before turning south along the A24 close to the western boundary. The Surrey Cycleway approaches Box Hill from the west via Westhumble, before turning to the south towards Dorking.

===Walking===
The North Downs Way long-distance footpath from Farnham to Dover, crosses the River Mole at the Stepping Stones and then runs from west to east at the top of the scarp slope, passing in front of the Salomons Memorial.

The Thames Down Link follows the course of Stane Street across Mickleham Downs, to the north of Box Hill, and meets the North Downs Way close to the Burford Bridge Hotel.

==Cultural references==
===Art===

In 1733, George Lambert painted two views of Box Hill, now held by The Tate and the Yale Center for British Art.

&quot;The Stonebreaker&quot; (1857 -1858), a painting by John Brett (1831–1902), depicts a young boy breaking stones for road mending, with Box Hill in the background.

A watercolour entitled &quot;Box Hill, Surrey&quot; dated 1861 by William Leighton Leitch (1804–1883), which depicts the view looking northwards from the top of the Burford Spur before the Zig Zag Road was built, is part of the Royal Collection.

The &quot;Box Hill Road River&quot;, a highly curved, line painted onto the surface of the Zig Zag Road by the British sculptor and land artist Richard Long, was commissioned jointly by the London 2012 Festival and the National Trust to celebrate the route of the Olympic Cycling road races.

===Literature===

John Evelyn notes in his &quot;Diary&quot; in 1662 that Box Hill was frequented by the ladies and gentlemen from nearby Epsom spa.

Daniel Defoe (the author of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;) was educated for five years (until around the age of fourteen) at the Rev. James Fisher&#x27;s boarding school in Pixham Lane, Dorking. He writes extensively about the area around Box Hill in his travelogue, &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot; (1724–1727), which describes the country shortly before the start of the Industrial Revolution. He records that in the late 17th century, Sir Adam Browne the then landowner, approved the fitting out of a cave or vault close to what is now the Salomons Memorial, to supply &#x27;refreshment&#x27; to visitors to the hill. A group of young Dissenters from Dorking were so disgusted by the &#x27;debauched&#x27; behaviour that the sale of alcohol encouraged (which took place even on Sundays), that they stormed up the hill one Saturday night and blew up the cavern with gunpowder.

The writer Edward Beavan describes the hill and the surrounding area of Surrey in his poem &quot;Box-Hill, a descriptive poem&quot;, published in 1777.
The &#x27;&#x27;, a pivotal passage of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Emma&quot; (first published in 1815) is set at Box Hill.

Celia Fiennes, a contemporary of Defoe, described Box Hill in her travel memoirs, which were published in 1888 (almost 150 years after her death) under the title &quot;Through England on a Side Saddle&quot;. 
:&quot;Box Hill… is the Continuation of the Ridge of hills I mentiond by Maidstone; its a Greate height and shows you a vast precipice down on the farther side, and such a vast vale full of woods Enclosures and Little towns. There is a very good river that runs by a Little town Called Darken just at the foote of this hill, very famous for good troutts and great store of ffish. On this hill the top is Cover&#x27;d with box whence its name proceeds, and there is other wood but its all Cutt in Long private walks very shady and pleasant, and this is a great diversion to the Company and would be more ffrequented if nearer Epsom town.&quot;

In &quot;England: A Nation&quot;, (London: R. Brimley Johnson, 1904), edited by Lucian Oldershaw, and in a chapter entitled &quot;The Patriotic Idea&quot; written by G. K. Chesterton, the beauty of Box Hill violated by an invading army is used to express a healthy patriot&#x27;s love for his nation as opposed to the jingoistic nationalism of tabloid newspapers:
:&quot;But just as a man who has been in love will find it difficult to write a whole frantic epic about a flirtation, so all that kind of rhetoric about the Union Jack and the Anglo-Saxon blood, which has made amusing the journalism of this country for the last six years, will be merely impossible to the man who has for one moment called up before himself what would be the real sensation of hearing that a foreign army was encamped on Box Hill.&quot;

Mystery author Cyril Hare sets his 1954 novel, &quot;That Yew Tree&#x27;s Shade&quot; (published in the US as &quot;Death Walks the Woods&quot;), at &quot;Yew Hill&quot;, which Hare admits in an introduction is modelled on Box Hill.

In his comic novel, &quot;Box Hill&quot;, published in 2020, British author Adam Mars-Jones tells the story of a same-sex relationship between a teenager and an older man, set within the Surrey motorbiking fraternity of the mid-1970s.

===Music===

British biker rock band Dumpy&#x27;s Rusty Nuts released a single called &quot;Box Hill or Bust&quot; in 1984. The song is something of a cult anthem for bikers and reflects the popularity of Box Hill among the biking community.

In Public Image Limited&#x27;s song &quot;Flowers of Romance&quot;, John Lydon sings &quot;I&#x27;ve got binoculars. On top of Box Hill&quot;.

In Richard Thompson&#x27;s song &quot;1952 Vincent Black Lightning&quot; (released in 1991), Box Hill is the location to which James and Red Molly ride on James&#x27; motorcycle. In cover versions of this song by American musicians, Box Hill is sometimes changed to Knoxville, a city in Tennessee.

The first song on Ben Watt&#x27;s 1983 debut album &quot;North Marine Drive&quot; is entitled &quot;On Box Hill&quot;.

Actor and singer Tom Felton&#x27;s song called &quot;Time Well Spent&quot; mentions him going to &quot;chill out on Box Hill&quot;.

===Film===

The racing scenes during the opening credits of the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang were filmed on the Zig Zag Road.

The 2012 British film &quot;Berberian Sound Studio&quot; contains a short film-within-the-film – a spoof 1970s-style documentary about the outstanding natural and man-made features of Box Hill.

==In the news==
In 1963 Great Train Robber, Jimmy White, hid £30,440 (approximately one fifth of his share of the stolen cash), in a caravan at Clovelly Caravan Park at the top of Box Hill.

In 1995 teenager Ruth Wilson disappeared after being dropped off by taxi on Box Hill.

In 2013 a body that had lain undiscovered for two years was found on Box Hill. It was identified as missing teacher Brian Hynard who had left two suicide notes before disappearing.

<text>Melrose House is a stately mansion and museum located opposite Burgers Park in Pretoria, South Africa.

==History==
Built in 1886 by the prosperous Pretoria businessman George Jesse Heys, it was named after the famous Melrose Abbey in Scotland. Melrose House gained fame during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) when Lord Roberts requisitioned it as the headquarters for the British forces after Pretoria was invaded in June 1900. For more than 18 months, instructions for the British forces in the field were issued from here. The use of the house as a military headquarters ended when the Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the war, was signed there on 31 May 1902.

The Pretoria City Council purchased the house and its contents in 1967 for R300,000 for restoration, culminating in State President of South Africa Charles Robberts Swart opening it as a museum and declaring it a national heritage site on May 17, 1971.

==Museum==
Today the elegant mansion is a historic house museum. It is an example of the transition from Victorian to Edwardian architectural styles and interiors. The interior is characterised by colourful stained glass windows, paintings by English artists, carpets in rich colours, ornate ceilings and fireplaces, as well as valuable porcelain ornaments. The majority of these items belonged to the Heys family itself. Notably the museum contains the room and the table on which the Treaty of Vereeniging (which ended the Second Boer War) was signed. Annual antique markets are held on the premises.

<doc id="468185" wikidata="Q311674" url="?curid=468185" title="Francesco Landini">
<text>Francesco Landini ( or 1335 – 2 September 1397; also known by many names) was a Florentine composer, poet, organist, singer and instrument maker, and a central figure of the music of the Trecento in the Italian peninsula. 

==Name==
Francesco&#x27;s name is recorded in many variants throughout medieval manuscripts and documents, including, Francesco degli Organi, Francesco il Cieco, Francesco da Firenze, Magister Franciscus de Florentia, Magister Franciscus Coecus Horghanista de Florentia (in the Squarcialupi Codex), Francesco degli orghani and Cechus de Florentia. 

Modern scholars no longer accept the idea that he was a member of the Landini family and prefer to use the names &quot;Francesco degli Organi&quot; or &quot;Francesco degli orghani&quot; (Francesco of the organs), &quot;Francesco da Firenze&#x27;&quot;(Francesco of Firenze), and &quot;Francesco il Cieco&quot; or &quot;Franciscus cecus&quot; (Francesco the blind) to refer to the composer. The surname &quot;Landini&quot; or &quot;Landino&quot; has not been linked to the composer in any sources of the 14th century nor in secondary references in the 15th century. The evidence linking him to the Landini family via his presumed father, who was identified by Filippo Villani as a painter who lived a simple life is no longer accepted by art historians. It can therefore also no longer be maintained that the painter Jacopo del Casentino (formerly also referred to as &quot;Jacopo Landino&quot;) was his father or that Cristoforo Landino was his great-nephew. It was Cristoforo&#x27;s naming of Francesco as an ancestor when he connected himself to an ancestor &quot;Lando di Nato,&quot; taking on the family name of &quot;Landini&quot; that has influenced centuries of scholars to call the composer Francesco Landini or Landino.

==Context and sources==
Details of Francesco&#x27;s life are sketchy and few facts can be established with certainty, but the general outline has begun to take shape as more research has been done, especially into Florentine records. Most of the original biographical data on him comes from a 1385 book on famous Florentine citizens by the chronicler Filippo Villani, who was also born approximately 1325.

==Life and career==

Landini was most likely born in Florence, though Cristoforo Landino gave his birthplace as Fiesole. Blind from childhood (an effect of contracting smallpox), Landini became devoted to music early in life, and mastered many instruments, including the lute, as well as the art of singing, writing poetry, and composition. Villani, in his chronicle, also stated that Francesco was an inventor of instruments, including a stringed instrument called the &#x27;syrena syrenarum&#x27;, that combined features of the lute and psaltery, and it is believed to be the ancestor of the bandura.

Despite his young age, Landini was already active in the early 1350s and it is likely that he was very close to Petrarch. According to Villani, Francesco was given a crown of laurel by the King of Cyprus, who was in Venice for several periods during the 1360s. Landini probably spent some time in northern Italy prior to 1370. Evidence in some of his music also points to this: a motet by a certain &quot;Franciscus&quot; is dedicated to Andrea Contarini, who was Doge of Venice from 1368 to 1382; and in addition, his works are well represented in northern Italian sources.

He was employed as organist at the Florentine monastery of Santa Trinità in 1361, and at the church of San Lorenzo from 1365 onward. He was heavily involved in the political and religious controversies of his day, according to Villani, but he seems to have remained in the good graces of the Florentine authorities. Landini knew many of the other Italian composers of the Trecento, including Lorenzo da Firenze, with whom he was associated at Santa Trinità, as well as Andreas da Florentia, whom he knew in the 1370s. Around or shortly after 1375, Andreas hired him as a consultant to help build the organ at the Servite house in Florence. Among the surviving records are the receipts for the wine that the two consumed during the three days it had taken to tune the instrument. Landini also helped build the new organ at SS Annunziata in 1379, and in 1387 he was involved in yet another organ-building project, this time at Florence Cathedral.

He is buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. His tombstone, lost until the 19th century and now again displayed in the church, contains a depiction of him with a portative organ.

==Music==

Landini was the most prolific composer of the Italian &quot;Trecento&quot; style, sometimes also called the &quot;Italian ars nova&quot;. His output was almost exclusively secular. While there are records that he composed sacred music, none of it has survived. What have survived are eighty-nine &quot;ballate&quot; for two voices, forty-two &quot;ballate&quot; for three voices, and another nine which exist in both two and three-voice versions. In addition to the &quot;ballate,&quot; a smaller number of madrigals have survived. Landini is assumed to have written his own texts for many of his works. His output, preserved most completely in the &quot;Squarcialupi Codex,&quot; represents almost a quarter of all surviving 14th-century Italian music.

==Legacy==
Numerous contemporary writers attest to his fame, not only as a composer, but as a singer, poet, organist, philosopher, and passionately devoted citizen of Florence, notably Giovanni da Prato, in his book &quot;Paradiso degli Alberti&quot;. This book, written in 1389 contains short stories, one of which supposedly was related by Landini himself. His reputation for moving an audience with his music was so powerful that writers noted &quot;the sweetness of his melodies was such that hearts burst from their bosoms.&quot;

Landini is the eponym of the Landini cadence (or &quot;Landino sixth&quot;), a cadential formula whereby the sixth degree of the scale (the submediant) is inserted between the leading note and its resolution on the tonic. However this cadence neither originated with him, nor is it unique to his music; it can be found in much polyphonic music of the period, and well into the 15th century (for example in the songs of Gilles Binchois). Gherardello da Firenze is the earliest composer to use the cadence whose works have survived. Yet Landini used the formula consistently throughout his music, so the eponym—which dates from after the medieval era—is appropriate.

<text>Operation Linebacker II, sometimes referred to as the Christmas bombings and, in Vietnam, Dien Bien Phu in the air, was a strategic bombing campaign conducted by the United States against targets in North Vietnam from 18 December to 29 December 1972, during the Vietnam War. More than 20,000 tons of ordnance was dropped on military and industrial areas in Hanoi and Haiphong and at least 1,624 civilians were killed. The operation was the final major military operation carried out by the U.S. during the conflict, and the largest bombing campaign involving heavy bombers since World War II. 

By late 1972, U.S. combat involvement in Vietnam had been dramatically reduced, and negotiations to end the war were underway in Paris. After secret meetings in October between lead negotiators Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, an informal agreement was reached. The terms included a total U.S. withdrawal, North Vietnam&#x27;s recognition of South Vietnam, new borders based on the present front lines, and new elections in the South, which would include the then-banned Communist Party of Vietnam. South Vietnamese president Nguyen Van Thieu, however, totally rejected these terms when he was informed about them and, following Richard Nixon&#x27;s reelection in November, the U.S. submitted new terms, which included the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) as the recognized national border, leading to a breakdown in negotiations on 16 December. Nixon issued an ultimatum for the North to return to negotiations within 72 hours, after which he ordered the bombing campaign on 18 December. Conducted by more than 200 B-52 bombers from Strategic Air Command supported by tactical planes of the Seventh Air Force and Task Force 77, the raids ran from 18 to 24 December and 26 to 29. The U.S. acknowledged the loss of 16 B-52 bombers, while North Vietnam claimed 34 bombers shot down.

The effect of the bombings on the peace negotiations is debated. On 22 December, Nixon asked the North to return to the talks with the terms offered in October and warned Thieu that he would sign the agreement even if Thieu did not. The North agreed, and Nixon ordered a halt to the bombings on 30 December. The North Vietnamese delegation stated that the campaign played no role in the decision to return to negotiations, while an aide to Kissinger remarked that &quot;[w]e bombed the North Vietnamese into accepting our concessions&quot;. On 27 January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed along the same terms as the initial October agreement.

==Background==

===&quot;Peace is at hand&quot;===
On 8 October 1972, U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese Politburo member Le Duc Tho met in Paris to discuss new proposals by both nations, hoping to reach mutually agreeable terms for a peace settlement for the nearly decade-old Vietnam War. Tho presented a new North Vietnamese plan which included proposals for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of American forces, and an exchange of prisoners of war. All three Vietnamese combatant governments—North Vietnam, the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG)—would remain intact, as would their separate armies. Hanoi no longer demanded that South Vietnamese president Nguyen Van Thieu be removed from office, the U.S. did not have to cease its aid to the southern government, and both Washington and Hanoi could continue to resupply their allies or forces on a parity basis. No new North Vietnamese forces were to be infiltrated from the north, and the U.S. agreed to extend post-war reconstruction assistance to North Vietnam.

The new terms on the table also included the establishment of a National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord, a loosely defined administrative structure which was to work toward general and local elections within South Vietnam. Political power would be shared by three groups: the Saigon government, the PRG, and a &quot;third force&quot; group to be mutually agreed upon by the other two parties. Since it was to work by consensus, nothing could be accomplished by the new council without the agreement of President Thieu.

When the two sides convened again on 17 October, there were two main areas of disagreement: the periodic replacement of South Vietnam&#x27;s American weaponry and the release of political prisoners held by the Saigon government. The North Vietnamese had made significant modifications to their past negotiating position and were hurrying to get the agreement signed before November, believing that President Richard Nixon would be more willing to make concessions before, rather than after, the upcoming presidential election. Although there were still some issues to be finalized, Kissinger was generally satisfied with the new terms and so notified Nixon, who gave his approval to the settlement.

Kissinger then flew on to Saigon on the 18th to discuss the terms with Thieu. The South Vietnamese president was not happy with either the new agreement or with Kissinger, who he felt had betrayed him. Although Kissinger knew Thieu&#x27;s negotiating position, he had not informed him of the changes made in Paris nor had his approval been sought. Kissinger &quot;had negotiated on behalf of the South Vietnamese government provisions that he, Thieu, had already rejected&quot;. Thieu completely castigated the agreement and proposed 129 textual changes to the document. He went further, demanding that the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Vietnams be recognized as a true international border and not as a &quot;provisional military demarcation line&quot; (as had been stipulated in the Geneva Accords) and that South Vietnam be recognized as a sovereign state. The supreme irony, in the words of Stanley Karnow, had now arrived: &quot;having fought a war to defend South Vietnam&#x27;s independence, the United States was now denying its legitimacy.&quot;

Thieu then went one step further on 26 October, and publicly released an altered version of the text that made the South Vietnamese provisions look even worse than they actually were. The North Vietnamese leadership, believing that they had been hoodwinked by Kissinger, responded by broadcasting portions of the agreement that gave the impression that the agreement conformed to Washington and Saigon&#x27;s objectives. Kissinger, hoping to both reassure the Communists of America&#x27;s sincerity, and convince Thieu of the administration&#x27;s dedication to a compromise, held a televised press conference at the White House during which he announced &quot;[w]e believe that peace is at hand.&quot;

On 20 November, the South Vietnamese revisions, and 44 additional changes demanded by Nixon, were presented to the North Vietnamese delegation by Kissinger. These new demands included: that the DMZ be accepted as a true international boundary; that a token withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops take place; that the North Vietnamese guarantee an Indochina-wide cease fire; and that a strong international peace-keeping force (the ICCS) be created for supervising and enforcing the cease-fire.

Once the North Vietnamese read the new demands, they began to retract their own concessions and wanted to bargain anew, leading Kissinger to proclaim that they were &quot;stalling&quot;. The talks, scheduled to last ten days, ended on 13 December, with both parties agreeing to resume negotiations. Teams of experts from each side met to discuss technicalities and protocols on 14 December, during which time the North Vietnamese representatives submitted a Vietnamese-language text of the protocol on prisoners containing several important changes that Hanoi had failed to gain in the main negotiating sessions. At a subsequent meeting of experts on 16 December, the North Vietnamese side &quot;stone-walled from beginning to end&quot;. The talks broke down that day, and the Hanoi negotiators refused to set a date for the resumption of negotiations.

==Prelude==

===Decisions===
Nixon was now working against a January deadline. Kissinger&#x27;s &quot;peace is at hand&quot; statement had raised expectations of a settlement among the US population. Even weightier on the President&#x27;s mind was the fact that the new 93rd Congress would go into session on 3 January, and the President feared that the heavily Democratic legislative branch would preempt his pledge of &quot;peace with honor&quot; by legislating an end to the war.

Also prompting the President toward some form of rapid offensive action was the cost of the force mobilization that had accompanied &quot;Operation Linebacker&quot;. The additional aircraft and personnel assigned to Southeast Asia for the operation was straining the Pentagon&#x27;s budget. The cost of maintaining this &quot;augmentation force&quot; totaled over $4 billion by mid-autumn and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird insisted that the President request a supplementary defense appropriation from Congress to pay for it. Nixon and Kissinger were convinced that the legislative branch &quot;would seize the opportunity to simply write the United States out of the war&quot;.

After returning from Paris on 14 December, and after consultations with Nixon, Kissinger fired off an ultimatum to Hanoi, threatening &quot;grave consequences&quot; if North Vietnam did not return to the negotiating table within 72 hours. On that day, Nixon ordered the reseeding of North Vietnamese ports with air-dropped naval mines and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff direct the Air Force to begin planning for a bombing campaign (a three-day &quot;maximum effort&quot; operation) which was to begin within 72 hours. Two days after the 16 December deadline had passed, the U.S. bombed Hanoi. Senior Air Force officers James R. McCarthy and George B. Allison stated years later that the operation had been mainly politically driven, as a negotiation tool to &quot;bring the point home&quot;.

Many historians of the Vietnam War follow the lead of President Nixon, who claimed that Hanoi&#x27;s representatives had walked out of the talks, refusing to continue the negotiations. Both sides had proclaimed their willingness to continue the talks; however, Hanoi&#x27;s negotiators refused to set a date, preferring to wait for the incoming Congress. The goal of President Nixon was not to convince Hanoi, but to convince Saigon. President Thieu had to be assured that &quot;whatever the formal wording of the cease-fire agreement, he could count on Nixon to come to the defense of South Vietnam if the North broke the cease-fire.&quot;

===Planning===

In the wake of Operation Linebacker, the U.S. had a force of 207 B-52 bombers available for use in Southeast Asia. A total of 54 bombers (all B-52Ds) were based at U-Tapao RTAFB, Thailand, while 153 were based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam (55 B-52Ds and 98 B-52Gs). This deployment comprised nearly half of the Air Force&#x27;s manned bomber fleet, and Strategic Air Command (SAC) commanders were initially reluctant to risk the expensive aircraft and their highly trained crews in such an operation; the production line for B-52s had long since been shut down, and losses could not be replaced. The use of large numbers of B-52s was unprecedented in the war and the proposed mass attacks on targets within of Hanoi &quot;represented a dynamic change in the employment of air resources&quot;.

The new operation, given the title Linebacker II, was marked by top-down planning by the SAC headquarters at Offutt AFB. Due to the restrictive time frame imposed by President Nixon (only three days) and the experience of Linebacker (in which North Vietnamese fighter aircraft had posed the highest threat to the bombers), SAC&#x27;s plan called for all of the bombers to approach Hanoi at night in three waves, each using identical approach paths and flying at the same altitude.

Once the aircraft had dropped their bombs, they were to execute what SAC termed &quot;post-target turns&quot; (PTT) to the west. These turns had two unfortunate consequences for the bombers: the B-52s would be turning into a strong headwind, slowing their ground speed by and prolonging their stay in the target area and the PTT would point the emitter antennas of their Electronic Warfare (EW) systems away from the radars they were attempting to jam, degrading the effectiveness of the cells, as well as showing the largest radar cross-section to the missile guidance radars. The aircraft employed had significantly different EW capabilities; the B-52G carried fewer jammers and put out appreciably less power than the B-52Ds but had more efficient engines and larger fuel tanks, hence they were assigned to longer range mission routes.

===Vietnamese air defense===
At the start of Linebacker II, the air defense missile forces of the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army had 36 air defense missile battalions armed with the S-75M Dvina (SA-2 Guideline) missile system; probably half were involved in this operation. The SA-2 system was first fielded in 1957 and was a fairly obsolete and cumbersome system by 1972 standards. The VPAF had only 71 operational aircraft. Of these, only 47 aircraft (31 MiG-21s and 16 MiG-17s) could be used for air combat. The MiG-19s were made in China and were not used in combat. Only 13 MiG-21 pilots and five MiG-17 pilots were trained for individual night flight in normal and flying in difficult meteorological conditions. Of 194 pilots, 75 (about 40 percent) were young.

==Bombings==

===Initial phase===
The first three missions of the operation were flown as planned by SAC on three consecutive nights beginning on 18 December 1972. On the first night 129 bombers took off, 87 of them from Guam. 39 support aircraft of the Seventh Air Force, the Navy&#x27;s Task Force 77 and the Marine Corps supported the bombers by providing F-4 Phantom fighter escorts, Republic F-105 Thunderchief Wild Weasel SAM-suppression missions, Air Force Douglas EB-66 Destroyer and Navy Grumman EA-6 Prowler radar-jamming aircraft, chaff drops, KC-135 refueling aircraft and search and rescue aircraft; the skies were dominated by American airpower to ensure the safety of the aircraft involved in the operation. One B-52 bomber pilot flying out of Guam recalled &quot;We took off one airplane a minute out of Guam for hours. Just on time takeoff after on time takeoff.&quot;
The targets of the first wave of bombers were the North Vietnamese airfields at Kép, Phúc Yên and Hòa Lạc and a warehouse complex at Yên Viên while the second and third waves struck targets around Hanoi. Three B-52&#x27;s were shot down by the 68 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) launched by North Vietnamese batteries, two B-52Gs from Andersen and a B-52D from U-Tapao. Two of the B-52&#x27;s were shot down over North Vietnam, while the third aircraft made it back to Thailand before crashing {&quot;The 11 Days of Christmas&quot; Marshall L. Michell III, pg 115}. Two D models from Andersen with heavy battle damage managed to limp into U-Tapao for repairs. Of the three downed B-52&#x27;s, parts of two crews were captured after bailing out over North Vietnam, while the third crew were all rescued in Thailand {&quot;The 11 Days of Christmas&quot; Marshall L. Michel III, pg 115}. That same evening, an Air Force F-111 Aardvark was shot down while on a mission to bomb the broadcasting facilities of Radio Hanoi. Unlike Linebacker, which had been launched in response to a North Vietnamese offensive in South Vietnam, President Nixon did not address the nation on television to explain the escalation. Instead, Kissinger held a press conference at which he accused (at Nixon&#x27;s behest) Le Duc Tho of having &quot;backed off&quot; on some of the October understandings.

On the second night, 93 sorties were flown by the bombers. Their targets included the Kinh No Railroad and storage area, the Thái Nguyên thermal power plant, and the Yên Viên complex. Although 20 SAMs were launched and a number of the bombers were damaged, none were lost on the mission. SAC expected that the third (and supposedly last) night of the operation would proceed just as well as the previous one. The targets of the 99 bombers sent in on 20 December included the Yên Viên railyards, the Ai Mo warehouse complex, the Thái Nguyên power plant, a transshipment point at Bắc Giang, the Kinh No Railroad complex and the Hanoi petroleum products storage area—all in or near Hanoi. The combination of repetitive tactics, degraded EW systems and limited jamming capability led to dire consequences when, as the official Air Force history of the campaign has stated, &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot;

The repetitious nature of the previous evening&#x27;s strike profiles had allowed North Vietnamese air defense forces to anticipate strike patterns and to salvo 34 missiles into the target area. Four B-52Gs and three B-52Ds were lost in the first and third waves of the mission. A fourth D model, returning to Thailand, crashed in Laos. Only two of the eight downed crews were recovered by search and rescue aircraft. The repercussions from the mission were fast and furious. SAC headquarters was under pressure from &quot;many external sources&quot; to &quot;stop the carnage ... it has become a blood bath&quot;. Of more concern was the position taken by many senior Air Force officers that they &quot;would lose too many bombers and that airpower doctrine would be proven fallacious ... or, if the bombing were stopped, the same thing would occur&quot;.

The main problem seemed to lie within the headquarters of SAC, which had based its tactics on a MiG threat that had not materialized during the three missions. The tactics (flight paths, altitudes, formations, timing, etc.) had not varied. The Air Force explanation for this course of events was that the similarity would be helpful to the B-52 crews, who were inexperienced in flying in such high-threat environments. Air Force historian Earl Tilford offered a differing opinion: &quot;Years of dropping bombs on undefended jungle and the routines of planning for nuclear war had fostered a mind-set within the SAC command that nearly led to disaster ... Poor tactics and a good dose of overconfidence combined to make the first few nights of Linebacker nightmarish for the B-52 crews.&quot; During the operation the USAF depended almost entirely on the Ryan Model 147 Buffalo Hunter AQM-34L/M unmanned aerial vehicles for bomb damage assessment due to bad weather.

===Re-evaluation===

It was at this point that President Nixon ordered that the effort be extended past its original three-day deadline. The first change that could be made by local Air Force commanders was divulged by a comparison of the differences between the radar jamming equipment of the B-52 models. The equipment aboard the G models was designed for use in the more sophisticated air defense environment of the Soviet Union, not against the more antiquated SA-2 and Fan Song radar systems used by the North Vietnamese. SAC headquarters stipulated that only the aircraft stationed at U-Tapao (equipped with more powerful and sophisticated ECM gear) be allowed over the North. On the fourth night (21 December) of the operation, 30 of the U-Tapao bombers struck the Hanoi storage area, the Văn Điển storage depot, and Quang Te Airfield. Two more of the D models were lost to Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). On the following night, the target area shifted away from Hanoi to the port city of Haiphong and its petroleum storage areas. Once again, 30 aircraft participated in the strikes, but this time there were no losses among the bombers. An F-111 was shot down over the Kinh No Railroad complex.

On the 22nd, over 100 bombs from a B-52 hit the Bach Mai Hospital in the southern suburbs of Hanoi, obliterating the building and killing 28 doctors, nurses and pharmacists and wounding 22, despite most taking refuge in the hospital&#x27;s basement. Almost the entire hospital was destroyed, including the operating rooms and pharmacy stock. The US military claimed that the hospital &quot;frequently housed anti-aircraft positions.&quot; According to the director of the hospital, Đỗ Doãn Đại, the US bombing served to break the morale of hospital staff and Hanoians.

The civilian deaths were criticized by the North Vietnamese and U.S. peace activists. The hospital sat 1 kilometer from the runway of Bach Mai Airfield and a major fuel storage facility was only away. Two days before Christmas, SAC added SAM sites and airfields to the target list. Air Force F-111s were sent in before the bombers to strike the airfields and reduce the threat of enemy fighters. The F-111s proved so successful in these operations that their mission for the rest of the campaign was shifted to SAM site suppression.

The bomber missions of the sixth night (23 December) again avoided Hanoi and hit SAM sites northeast of the city and the Lang Dang Railroad yards. There were no losses. On the following night, the run of American good luck (and avoidance of Hanoi) continued. Thirty bombers, supported by 69 tactical aircraft, struck the railyards at Thái Nguyên and Kép and no American aircraft were lost during the mission. Although the B-52s got most of the publicity during the campaign, the tactical aircraft were also hard at work. While the B-52s and F-111s attacked by night, an average of 69 tactical aircraft of the Air Force, Navy and Marines attacked by day (averaging nearly 100 sorties per day). Losses for these aircraft were extremely light, with fewer than a dozen lost during the entire campaign. It was not difficult for their crews to deduce why. The North Vietnamese air defense forces &quot;simply waited for nightfall and the arrival of more lucrative targets.&quot;

===Final phase===
The strikes of 24 December were followed by a 36-hour Christmas stand-down, during which Air Force planners went to work to revise their plans for the next phase of operations. Due to aircraft losses during the initial phase, they intended to launch an all-out attack on North Vietnam&#x27;s air defenses when the operation resumed. This course was also necessary since, by Christmas, most of the strategic targets within North Vietnam were in shambles. SAC also belatedly turned over tactical mission planning to its subordinate Eighth Air Force headquarters on Guam, which promptly revised the tactics. Instead of using waves, all of the bombers would be in and out of the target area within 20 minutes and they would approach from different directions and at different altitudes. They would exit by varying routes and the steep PTTs were eliminated. Ten targets, in the Hanoi and Haiphong areas were to be struck by bombers approaching in seven streams, four of which were to come in off the Gulf of Tonkin.

On 26 December 120 bombers lifted off to strike Thái Nguyên, the Kinh No complex, the Duc Noi, Hanoi, and Haiphong Railroads and a vehicle storage area at Văn Điển. 78 of the bombers took off from Andersen AFB in one time block, the largest single combat launch in SAC history, while 42 others came in from Thailand. The bombers were supported by 113 tactical aircraft which provided chaff corridors, escort fighters, Wild Weasel SAM suppression and electronic countermeasures support. The North Vietnamese air defense system was overwhelmed by the number of aircraft it had to track in such a short time and by a dense blanket of chaff laid down by the fighter-bombers. 250 SAMs had been fired from 18 until 24 December and the strain on the remaining North Vietnamese inventory showed, since only 68 were fired during the mission. One B-52 was shot down near Hanoi and another damaged aircraft made it back to U-Tapao, where it crashed just short of the runway. Only two members of the crew survived.

On the following night, 60 bombers flew, with some attacking SAM sites while others struck Lang Dang, Duc Noi, the Trung Quang Railroad and Văn Điển. One B-52 was so heavily damaged that its crew ejected over Laos, where it was rescued. A second aircraft was not so lucky. It took a direct hit and went down while attacking the Trung Quang Railroad yards. During the evening&#x27;s operations two F-4s and an HH-53 search and rescue helicopter were also shot down. Day ten (28 December) called for strikes by 60 B-52s–15 Gs and 15 Ds from Andersen and 30 Ds from U-Tapao, The aircraft formed six waves attacking five targets. Four of the waves struck targets in the Hanoi area (including SAM Support Facility #58), while the fifth hit the Lang Dang Railroad yards southwest of Lạng Sơn, a major choke-point on the supply route from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. No aircraft were lost on the mission. By the eleventh day (29 December), there were few strategic targets worthy of mention left within North Vietnam. There were two SAM storage areas at Phúc Yên and the Lang Dang yards that could be profitably attacked. A total of 60 aircraft again made the trip North but the mix was altered; U-Tapao again provided 30 D models but the Andersen force was varied, putting 12 G models and 18 Ds over the North. Total bombing was rounded out by sending 30 G models on Arc Light missions in the southern panhandle of North Vietnam and in South Vietnam.

==Aftermath==
===Negotiating===
On 22 December, Washington asked Hanoi to return to the talks with the terms offered in October. On 26 December, Hanoi notified Washington that it was willing to &quot;impress upon Nixon that the bombing was not the reason for this decision, the CPV Politburo told Nixon that halting the bombing was not a precondition for further talks&quot;. Nixon replied that he wanted the technical discussions to resume on 2 January and that he would halt the bombing if Hanoi agreed. They did so and Nixon suspended aerial operations north of the 20th parallel on 30 December. He then informed Kissinger to agree to the terms offered in October, if that was what it took to get the agreement signed. Senator Henry Jackson (D, Wash.), tried to persuade Nixon to make a televised address to explain to the American people that &quot;we bombed them in order to get them back to the table.&quot; It would have been extremely difficult to get informed observers in the U.S. to believe that he &quot;had bombed Hanoi in order to force North Vietnamese acceptance of terms they had already agreed to&quot;.

Now the only stumbling block on the road to an agreement was President Thieu. Nixon tried to placate him by writing on 5 January that &quot;you have my assurance of continued assistance in the post-settlement period and that we will respond with full force should the settlement be violated by North Vietnam.&quot; By this time, due to congressional opposition, Nixon was in no position to make such a promise, since the possibility of obtaining the requisite congressional appropriations was nil. The South Vietnamese president still refused to agree. On 14 January Nixon made his most serious threat: &quot;I have therefore irrevocably decided to proceed to initial the agreement on 23 January 1973… I will do so, if necessary, alone&quot;.

On 9 January, Kissinger and Le Duc Tho returned to Paris. The agreement struck between the U.S. and North Vietnam was basically the same one that had been reached in October. The additional demands that had been made by the U.S. in December were generally discarded or went against the U.S. John Negroponte, one of Kissinger&#x27;s aides during the negotiations, was more caustic: &quot;[w]e bombed the North Vietnamese into accepting our concessions.&quot; The DMZ was defined as provided for in the Geneva Accords of 1954, and would in no way be recognized as an international boundary. The demanded withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam was not mentioned at all in the text of the agreement. Kissinger did obtain a &quot;verbal agreement&quot; from Tho for a token withdrawal of 30,000 North Vietnamese troops.

The demand for an inclusive, Indochina-wide cease-fire was simply discarded in the written agreement. Once again, Kissinger had to be satisfied with a &quot;verbal understanding&quot; that a cease-fire would be instituted in Laos simultaneous with or shortly following that in South Vietnam. An agreement on Cambodia (where the North Vietnamese had no influence over the Khmer Rouge) was out of the question. The size of the ICCS was finally decided by splitting the difference in the number demanded by both parties at 1,160 personnel. The Paris Peace Accords were signed at the Majestic Hotel in Paris on 27 January 1973.

===Outcome and assessments===
==== Military ====

During Operation Linebacker II, 741 B-52 sorties were dispatched to bomb North Vietnam; 729 completed their missions. B-52s dropped 15,237 tons of ordnance on 18 industrial and 14 military targets (including eight SAM sites) while fighter-bombers added another 5,000 tons of bombs to the tally. Another 212 B-52 missions were flown within South Vietnam in support of ground operations during the campaign. Ten B-52s were shot down over the North and five others were damaged and crashed in Laos or Thailand. Thirty-three B-52 crew members were killed or missing in action, another 33 became prisoners of war, and 26 more were rescued.

Over 11 days, North Vietnamese air defenses fired 266 SA-2 missiles downing—according to North Vietnam—34 B-52s and four F-111s. While warding off the massive strike by U.S strategic, tactical and carrier aviation, the North Vietnamese missile air defense forces conducted over 180 engagements, two-thirds of which were against B-52s. North Vietnamese claims of aircraft destroyed or shot down differ greatly from US official records. In Marshall Michel&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;The 11 Days of Christmas: America&#x27;s Last Vietnam Battle&quot;, the author uses mission records to confirm that &quot;15 B-52s were shot down… 10 crashed &#x27;on the spot&#x27; in North Vietnam and 5 were able to move out of the Hanoi area and into Laos or Thailand before they crashed&quot;. North Vietnam claimed 36 aircraft destroyed (31 B-52s and 5 tactical aircraft) with the expenditure of 244 missiles against the B-52s and 22 missiles against tactical aircraft, or 7.9 missiles for every B-52 aircraft shot down, or 4.4 missiles for every tactical aircraft shot down. During the offensive, they initially overcame various types of interference and obstacles employed by the U.S aircraft to interrupt missile engagement. In the latter stages of the bombing campaign, due to a change in tactics, B-52 losses decreased significantly. By the last night of the campaign, no losses were reported. During the 11 days of Operation Linebacker, the B-52s flew 795 sorties with a loss rate of 2.63 percent (15 were shot down and five others were heavily damaged)

The Air Force flew 769 sorties and 505 were flown by the Navy and Marine Corps in support of the bombers. Twelve of these aircraft were lost on the missions (two F-111s, three F-4s, two A-7s, two A-6s, an EB-66, an HH-53 rescue helicopter and an RA-5C reconnaissance aircraft). During these operations, ten American aviators were killed, eight captured and 11 rescued. US Air Force losses included fifteen B-52s, two F-4s, two F-111s, one EB-66 and one HH-53 search-and-rescue helicopter. Navy losses included two A-7s, two A-6s, one RA-5 and one F-4. Seventeen of these losses were attributed to SA-2 missiles, three to daytime MiG attacks, three to antiaircraft artillery and four to unknown causes. U.S. forces claimed eight MiGs were shot down during the operation, including two by B-52 tail gunners. The two B-52 tail gunner kills were not confirmed by VPAF, and they admitted to the loss of only three MiGs.

According to Dana Drenkowski and Lester W. Grau, the number of aircraft lost by the USAF is unconfirmed since the USAF figures are also suspect. If a plane was badly damaged but managed to land, the USAF did not count as a loss, even if it was a write-off. During the operation, the USAF told the press that 17 B-52s were lost but later, the USAF told Congress that only 13 B-52s were lost. Nine B-52s that returned to U-Tapao airfield were too badly damaged to fly again. The number of B-52s that managed to return to Guam but were combat losses remains unknown. The overall B-52 loss is probably between 22 and 27.

During this operation, the VPAF launched 31 air sorties of which 27 were flown by MiG-21s and four were flown by MiG-17s. They conducted eight aerial engagements and claimed two B-52s, four F-4s and one RA-5C shot down. Their losses were three MiG-21s. Two B-52s were claimed by North Vietnamese MiG-21 fighter pilots; both incidents were attributed to SAMs by the U.S. The raids inflicted severe damage to North Vietnam&#x27;s infrastructure. The Air Force estimated the bombs caused 500 rail interdictions, destroyed 372 pieces of rolling stock and of petroleum products and eliminated 80 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s electrical power production capability. Logistical imports into North Vietnam, assessed by U.S. intelligence at 160,000 tons per month when the operation began, had dropped by January 1973, to 30,000 tons per month. Lê Duẩn later admitted that the bombing &quot;completely obliterated our economic foundation.&quot; Despite the damage, an enormous effort was made to keep transportation networks open. Some 500,000 workers were mobilized to repair bomb damage as needed, with an additional 100,000 constantly at work. The raids did not break the stalemate in the South, nor halt the flow of supplies down the Ho Chi Minh trail.

===Casualties===

According to official North Vietnamese sources the bombing campaign killed 1,624 civilians, including 306 in Haiphong and 1,328 in Hanoi. The book &quot;Hanoi – The aerial Dien Bien Phu&quot; from the &quot;People&#x27;s Army Publishing House&quot; gives a death toll of 2,368 civilians killed and 1,355 others injured. The book states that many neighborhoods and villages were destroyed, 5,480 houses and nearly 100 other buildings including factories, schools, hospitals, and stations were destroyed. By 20 December 1972, there were 215 dead and 325 injured in Hanoi. In Hai Phong alone on 18 December, 45 people were killed, 131 people were injured. Kham Thien Street, Hanoi was attacked on the night of 26 December 1972, killing 278 people, including 91 women, 40 old people, and 55 children. 178 children were orphaned in Kham Thien Street and 290 people were injured, 2,000 houses, schools, temples, theaters, and clinics collapsed, of which 534 houses were completely destroyed.

House 51 on Kham Thien Street was completely blown into a crater and the seven people living there were killed. This area has been converted into a memorial with a stele bearing the words &quot;Khâm Thiên deeply holds the hatred of the American enemy&quot; and a bronze statue of a woman holding a child who died from an American bomb was based on the owner of the destroyed house. On the anniversary of the bombing each year, people living on the street and other places come to the memorial to burn incense sticks to commemorate those who died from American airstrikes. In the courtyard of Bạch Mai Hospital, there is a stele bearing the word &quot;Hatred&quot; to remember the bombing of the hospital on 22 December, which killed 1 patient and 30 nurses and doctors. At the time of the bombing, most doctors and patients had already been evacuated. Each department had only a few people on duty and approximately 300 patients had taken cover in the basement.

==== Diplomatic ====
The North Vietnamese government reported that the U.S. had &quot;carpet-bombed hospitals, schools, and residential areas, committing barbarous crimes against our people&quot;, citing the bombing of Bach Mai Hospital on 22 December and Kham Thien street on 26 December which they claimed had killed 278, wounded 290 and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.

Both the Soviet Union and China denounced the bombing, while some Western countries also criticized the US operation. In a famous speech, Olof Palme, the Prime Minister of Sweden, compared the bombings to a number of historical crimes including the bombing of Guernica, the massacres of Oradour-sur-glane, Babi Yar, Katyn, Lidice and Sharpeville and the extermination of Jews and other groups at Treblinka. He said that &quot;now another name can be added to this list: Hanoi, Christmas 1972&quot;. In response to his protests, the U.S. withdrew their ambassador from Sweden and told Stockholm not to send a new ambassador to Washington.

The new Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, whose country had pushed America to expand the war, angered the Nixon administration by criticizing the bombings in a letter to the U.S. President, chilling United States–Australia relations until Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal in 1975. In the U.S., Nixon was criticized as a &quot;madman&quot;, and some of the people who supported Operation Linebacker I, questioned the necessity and unusual intensity of Operation Linebacker II. Newspaper headlines included: &quot;Genocide&quot;, &quot;Stone-Age Barbarism&quot; and &quot;Savage and Senseless&quot;. The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) made some serious mistakes, suffered serious losses and their campaign came close to failure, yet after the war they launched a massive media and public relations blitz (and internal witch hunt) to prove that Linebacker II was an unqualified success that unfolded as planned. US officials claimed that the operation had succeeded in forcing North Vietnam&#x27;s Politburo to return to negotiating, citing the Paris Peace Accords signed shortly after the operation. Much of the American public had the impression that North Vietnam had been &quot;bombed into submission&quot;.

In Paris, the North Vietnamese refused to change the terms they had agreed to in the October 1972 agreement. When South Vietnam&#x27;s President Nguyen Van Thieu objected to the terms, Nixon threatened to depose him like Ngo Dinh Diem. In January 1973, the U.S. signed the agreement as the Paris Peace Accords. The main effect of the accord was to usher the United States out of the war. Journalist Bob Woodward later wrote that Richard Nixon thought, prior to Operation Linebacker II, that previous bombing campaigns against North Vietnam had achieved &quot;zilch&quot;. Woodward wrote that in early 1972 Nixon wrote a note to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, which said there was &quot;something wrong&quot; with the way the strategy was being carried out. Other notes, written at the same time, show that Nixon was frustrated with the resistance of the North Vietnamese and wanted to punish them, in an effort to &quot;go for broke&quot;. Some historians believed that Hanoi was not in need of any settlement, and only agreed to do so to get the United States out of Vietnam. The historian Gareth Porter wrote that Hanoi&#x27;s objective was an agreement on the October terms, and that &quot;the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong forced Nixon and Kissinger to accept the terms they had earlier rejected.&quot; However, according to Pierre Asselin, had the bombing been a failure, as Hanoi said it was, the North Vietnamese leadership would never have agreed to Nixon&#x27;s request to talk. Hanoi agreed to resume talks only because the bombing had crippled their country. Additionally, the bombing paved the way for the finalization of an agreement, thus ending American intervention on terms acceptable to the Nixon administration. Nevertheless, the terms were also favorable to North Vietnam. American historian A.J. Langguth wrote the Christmas bombings were &quot;pointless&quot; as the final peace agreement of 23 January 1973 was essentially the same as that of 8 October 1972 as Thọ refused to make any substantial concessions. John Negroponte, in the 2017 documentary &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;, was disdainful of the attack&#x27;s value, stating &quot;[w]e bombed them into accepting our concessions.&quot;

<text>Marvin Camel (born December 24, 1951) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1974 to 1990. He was the first cruiserweight world champion, having held the WBC title in 1980 and the IBF title from 1983 to 1984.

==Professional boxing career==
Marvin Camel fought Bill Sharkey in the first cruiserweight title fight ever when the North American Boxing Federation (NABF) sanctioned a bout for its continental title on June 5, 1979. Camel won the match, which led to the World Boxing Council (WBC) sanctioning a cruiserweight title fight between Marvin Camel and Mate Parlov on December 8, 1979. Camel fought Parlov in Yugoslavia to a draw in the first ever cruiserweight world title bout. In the rematch, in Las Vegas, Camel beat Parlov for the vacant WBC world Cruiserweight title in 1980, losing the title in his first defense, to Carlos De León who replaced David Pearce. After losing in a rematch to De Leon, he became, in 1983, the IBF&#x27;s first world champion, by beating Roddy McDonald who also replaced David Pearce after the BBBoC would not sanction the Cruiserweight division in the UK and thus becoming world Cruiserweight champion for the second time when he claimed that organization&#x27;s title. He later lost the title to Lee Roy Murphy.

He lost his final bout in June 1990 against Eddie “Young Joe Louis” Taylor in Minneapolis. The 10-round decision left his lifetime mark at 45-13-5.

Camel&#x27;s pro career took him from Ronan to 13 states and seven foreign nations on three continents.

“I’ve had a good life, as far as boxing is concerned, winning two world titles, losing world titles, seeing the world,” Camel said in 2015. “Some things people only dream about having, I did it. I’ve been there. I’ve been to the top of the mountain. But I feel there’s still something out there that I’ve got to have, and I don’t know what it is.” 

He is the subject of a biography released in December 2014, titled &#x27;Warrior in the Ring&#x27; by Brian D&#x27;Ambrosio. The book was nominated for the High Plains Book Award and several other awards.

In December 2014, D&#x27;Ambrosio and Camel attended the 52nd Annual World Boxing Convention.

==Honors==
In 2006 at the World Boxing Council&#x27;s 44th annual convention WBC President José Sulaimán awarded Camel honorary champion status.

<doc id="468205" wikidata="Q901340" url="?curid=468205" title="Standard Widget Toolkit">
<text>The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) is a graphical widget toolkit for use with the Java platform. It was originally developed by Stephen Northover at IBM and is now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation in tandem with the Eclipse IDE. It is an alternative to the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing Java graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits provided by Sun Microsystems as part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE).

To display GUI elements, the SWT implementation accesses the native GUI libraries of the operating system using Java Native Interface (JNI) in a manner that is similar to those programs written using operating system-specific application programming interfaces (APIs). Programs that call SWT are portable, but the implementation of the toolkit, despite part of it being written in Java, is unique for each platform.

The toolkit is free and open-source software distributed under the Eclipse Public License, which is approved by the Open Source Initiative.

== History ==
The first Java GUI toolkit was the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), introduced with Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 as one component of Sun Microsystems&#x27; Java platform. The original AWT was a simple Java wrapper library around native (operating system-supplied) widgets such as menus, windows, and buttons.

Swing was the next generation GUI toolkit introduced by Sun in Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.2. Swing was developed to provide a richer set of GUI software components than AWT. Swing GUI elements are all-Java with no native code: instead of wrapping native GUI components, Swing draws its own components by using Java 2D to call low-level operating system drawing routines.

The roots of SWT go back to work that Object Technology International (OTI), did in the 1990s when creating multiplatform, portable, native widget interfaces for Smalltalk, originally for OTI Smalltalk, which became IBM Smalltalk in 1993. IBM Smalltalk&#x27;s Common Widget layer provided fast, native access to multiple platform widget sets while still providing a common API without suffering the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; problem typical of other portable graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits. IBM was developing VisualAge, an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Smalltalk. They decided to open-source the project, which led to the development of Eclipse, intended to compete against other IDEs such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Eclipse is written in Java, and IBM developers, deciding that they needed a toolkit that had &quot;native look and feel&quot; and &quot;native performance&quot;, created SWT as a Swing replacement.

== Design ==

SWT is a wrapper around native code objects, such as GTK objects, Motif objects etc. Because of this, SWT widgets are often referred to as &quot;heavyweight&quot;, evoking images of a light Java wrapper around a &quot;heavy&quot; native object. In cases where native platform GUI libraries do not support the functionality required for SWT, SWT implements its own GUI code in Java, similar to Swing. In essence, SWT is a compromise between the low-level performance and look and feel of AWT and the high-level ease of use of Swing.

According to the Eclipse Foundation, &quot;SWT and Swing are different tools that were built with different goals in mind. The purpose of SWT is to provide a common API for accessing native widgets across a spectrum of platforms. The primary design goals are high performance, native look and feel, and deep platform integration. Swing, on the other hand, is designed to allow for a highly customizable look and feel that is common across all platforms.&quot;

It has been argued that SWT features a clean design, in part inspired by Erich Gamma of Design Patterns fame.

SWT is a simpler toolkit than Swing, with less (possibly) extraneous functionality for the average developer. This has led some people to argue that SWT lacks functionality when compared to Swing.

James Gosling, the creator of the Java language, has argued that SWT is too simple, and is a difficult toolkit to port to new platforms for the same reason that AWT once had porting problems: that it is too simple, too low level, and too tied to the Win32 GUI API, leading to problems adapting the SWT API to other GUI toolkits, such as Motif and OS X Carbon.

Although SWT does not implement the popular model–view–controller (MVC) architecture used in Swing and many other high-level GUI toolkits, the JFace library, which is developed as part of the same Eclipse project, does provide a cross-platform, higher-level MVC abstraction atop SWT. Developers may choose to use JFace to provide more flexible and abstract data models for complex SWT controls such as trees, tables, and lists, or access those controls directly as needed.

=== Look and feel ===

SWT widgets have the same &quot;look and feel&quot; as native widgets because they often are the same native widgets. This is in contrast to the Swing toolkit where all widgets are emulations of native widgets. In some cases the difference is distinguishable. For example, the macOS tree widget features a subtle animation when a tree is expanded and default buttons have an animated pulsing glow to focus the user&#x27;s attention on them. The default Swing version of these widgets does not animate.

Since SWT is simply a wrapper around native GUI code, it does not require large numbers of updates when that native code is changed, providing that operating system vendors are careful not to break clients of their API when the operating systems are updated. The same cannot be said of Swing, which supports the ability to change the look and feel of the running application with &quot;pluggable looks and feels&quot;. These enable emulating the native platform user interface using themes, which must be updated to mirror operating system GUI changes, such as theme or other look and feel updates.

SWT aims for &quot;deep platform integration&quot;, the Eclipse reference to SWT&#x27;s use of native widgets. According to Mauro Marinillia of developer.com, &quot;whenever one needs a tight integration with the native platform, SWT can be a plus&quot;. This deep integration can be useful in a number of ways, for example enabling SWT to wrap ActiveX objects on Microsoft Windows.

=== Programming ===
The following is a basic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program using SWT. It shows a window (&quot;Shell&quot;) and a label.

import org.eclipse.swt.*;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class HelloWorld
 public static void main (String[] args)
 Display display = new Display();
 Shell shell = new Shell(display);
 Label label = new Label(shell, SWT.NONE);
 label.setText(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 label.pack();
 shell.pack();
 shell.open();
 while (!shell.isDisposed())
 if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep();
 display.dispose();
}

Contrary to Swing, a &quot;Display&quot; class is necessary to access the underlying operating system, and its resources must be explicitly disposed of when they are no longer used.

=== Platform support ===
SWT must be ported to every new GUI library that needs supporting. Unlike Swing and AWT, SWT is not available on every Java-supported platform since SWT is not part of the Java release. There is also some evidence that the performance of SWT on platforms other than Windows is noticeably less efficient. Since SWT uses a different native library for each platform, SWT programs may be exposed to platform-specific bugs.

SWT exposes programs to more low-level details than Swing. This is because SWT is technically just a layer over native library provided GUI functionality, exposing the programmer to native GUI code is part of the design intent of SWT: &quot;Its goal is not to provide a rich user-interface design framework but rather the thinnest possible user-interface API that can be implemented uniformly on the largest possible set of platforms while still providing sufficient functionality to build rich graphical user interface (GUI) applications.&quot;

Since the SWT implementation is different for each platform, a platform-specific SWT library (JAR file) must be distributed with each application.

, SWT supports these platforms and/or GUI libraries:

* Windows:
** Win32
** Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), under development
* Unix-like: Linux, FreeBSD:
** GTK

* macOS:
** Cocoa
, SWT 4.7.3a (and 4.8M6) is officially compatible with the following operating systems (graphic library or similar if explicitly required / processors):

* Microsoft Windows (x86 and x86_64)
* Linux (GTK / PPC64 and PPC64LE)
* macOS (Cocoa / x86_64)
Windows XP has historically been supported as have Linux on s390, Solaris 11 (SPARCv9), Solaris 10 (x86_64), HP-UX (ia64), AIX (PPC and PPC64).

=== Performance ===
SWT was designed to be a &quot;high performance&quot; GUI toolkit; faster, more responsive and lighter on system resource usage than Swing.

There has been some attempted benchmarking of SWT and Swing, which concluded that SWT should be more efficient than Swing, although the applications benchmarked in this case were not complex enough to draw solid conclusions for all possible SWT or Swing uses. A fairly thorough set of benchmarks concluded that neither Swing nor SWT outperformed the other in the general case.

=== Extensibility and comparison to other Java code ===
Due to the use of native code, SWT classes do not allow for easy inheritance for all widget classes, which some users consider can hurt extensibility. This can make customizing existing widgets more difficult to achieve with SWT than if one were using Swing. Both toolkits support writing new widgets using only Java code, however in SWT extra work is needed to make the new widget work on every platform.

SWT widgets, unlike almost any other Java toolkit, requires manual object deallocation, in contrast to the standard Java practice of automatic garbage collection. SWT objects must be explicitly deallocated using the codice_1 method, which is analogous to the C language&#x27;s codice_2. If this is not done, memory leaks or other unintended behavior may result. On this matter, some have commented that &quot;explicitly de-allocating the resources could be a step back in development time (and costs) at least for the average Java developer&quot; and that &quot;this is a mixed blessing. It means more control (and more complexity) for the SWT developer instead of more automation (and slowness) when using Swing.&quot; The need for manual object deallocation when using SWT is largely due to SWT&#x27;s use of native objects. These objects are not tracked by the Java JVM, so it cannot track whether or not such objects are in use, and thus cannot garbage collect them at a suitable time.

== Development ==
There is some development activity to enable combining Swing and SWT. Two different approaches are being attempted:

* &quot;SwingWT&quot; is a project to provide an alternative Swing implementation. It uses an SWT back end to display its widgets, thus providing the native look and feel and performance advantages of SWT along with the same programming model as Swing.
* &quot;SWTSwing&quot; is a project to provide a Swing back end for SWT. In effect, SWT could be run using &quot;Swing native objects&quot; instead of, for example, GTK or Windows native objects. This would enable SWT to work on every platform that Swing supports.

Starting in 2006, there was an SWT-3.2 port to the programming language D called DWT. Since then, the project supports Windows 32-bit, and Linux GTK 32-bit for SWT-3.4. The DWT project also has an addon package that contains a port of JFace and Eclipse Forms.

With JavaFX becoming part of the Java SE platform there has been interest in developing a backend for SWT that relies on JavaFX in a similar way to SWTSwing relies on Swing. A prominent project trying to achieve that was &quot;SWT on JavaFX&quot; which became part of &quot;e(fx)clipse&quot; in 2014.

== Uses ==
Applications (alphabetically sorted) using SWT include:
* Apache Directory Studio, an LDAP browser–editor
* Eclipse and its plug-ins
* GumTree Platform, scientific workbench
* Haystack, information manager
* IBM Rational Software products: Rational Application Developer, Rational Software Architect, Rational Team Concert and others.
* IBM Lotus software products: Notes, Sametime, Symphony, and Expeditor
* Studio 3T, GUI client for MongoDB database 
* RSSOwl, feed aggregator
* SmartGit, a Git, Mercurial, and Apache Subversion (SVN) client
* TuxGuitar, an open-source tablature editor
* uDig, GIS tool
* Vuze, formerly named Azureus

Recent open-source efforts in the Eclipse community have led to a porting of SWT (and JFace) into a widget toolkit appropriate for the web. The result has been the Eclipse Remote Application Platform (RAP), which combines the qooxdoo Ajax library with the SWT API. Like other Java Ajax projects (such as Echo2, Vaadin and Google Web Toolkit), the usage of the SWT API allows developing applications quickly for the web in much the same way as for the desktop.

<text>Adolph Schayes ( ; May 19, 1928 – December 10, 2015) was an American professional basketball player and coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A top scorer and rebounder, he was a 12-time NBA All-Star and a 12-time All-NBA selection. Schayes won an NBA championship with the Syracuse Nationals in 1955. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and was also named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.

Schayes played his entire career with the Nationals and their successor, the Philadelphia 76ers, from 1948 to 1964. In his 16-year career, he led his team into the playoffs 15 times. After the Nationals moved to Philadelphia, Schayes became player-coach of the newly minted 76ers. He ended his playing career after the 1963–64 season and stayed on as coach for two more seasons, earning NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1966. He briefly coached with the Buffalo Braves.

==Early life==
Adolph Schayes was born on May 19, 1928, in the Bronx, New York, the son of Tina (&quot;née&quot; Michel), a homemaker, and Carl Schayes, a truck driver for Consolidated Laundries. His parents were Romanian-Jewish immigrants. He grew up on Davidson Avenue and 183rd Street, near Jerome Avenue in University Heights, Bronx.

Schayes attended Creston Junior High School 79 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, New York, where he excelled in basketball, playing for the basketball team and led it to a borough championship.

==College career==
Schayes played his college basketball at New York University (NYU) in 1944–48. In 1945, as a 16-year-old freshman, Schayes helped NYU reach the NCAA final. Schayes earned an aeronautical engineering degree, was an All-American in basketball and won the Haggerty Award in his final year. His NYU coach, Howard Cann, said of him: &quot;He was in the gym practicing every spare minute. We had to chase him out.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Syracuse Nationals / Philadelphia 76ers (1948–1964)===
Schayes was drafted by both the New York Knicks in the 1948 BAA draft (1st round; 4th pick overall), and by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in the NBL draft. The Blackhawks traded his rights to the Syracuse Nationals, who then offered him a contract worth $7,500 (worth $ today), 50% more than the Knicks, influencing his decision to go to Syracuse. Schayes played one season in the NBL and was named the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. The following season (1949–50), the Nationals moved to the newly formed National Basketball Association as part of the merger between the BAA and NBL.

Although tall for his era at 6&#x27; 8&quot; (203 cm), Schayes was especially known for his deadly, high-arcing, outside set-shot. It arced so high that his teammates came to call it the &quot;Sputnik&quot;. Defenders who attempted to deny him the outside shot were confronted by his powerful drive to the basket. These two offensive weapons served him well, even as the NBA was transitioning from basketball&#x27;s traditional set shot into a league of jump-shooters.

Early in Schayes&#x27; career, he broke his right arm and played almost an entire season in a cast. Oddly, this injury became a seminal point in his development: he learned to shoot with his off-hand, making him especially difficult to guard. He was one of the best—and the last—to use a two-handed set-shot with feet planted on the floor, before the game changed to one-handed jump shots.
In the 1949–50 season, Schayes was sixth in the league in assists, with 259. He led the NBA in rebounding in 1950–51 (in which he also had 10 of the top 14 individual rebounding games), with 1,080 and a 16.4-per-game average. He was third in the league in rebounding in 1952–53, with 920. In 1953–54, his 12.3 rebounds per game were fourth-best in the NBA.

In 1954–55, Schayes led his team to the NBA championship. In 1956–57, he led the league in minutes-per-game (39.6) and free throws (625), while grabbing 1,008 rebounds (3rd in the league) and averaging 22.6 points per game (4th in the league). In 1957, he set an NBA consecutive free throw record in a single game with 18. In 1957–58 he again led the league in minutes-per-game (40.5), and averaged a career-high 24.9 points per game, second in the league, while averaging 14.2 rebounds per game (fourth in the NBA).

Schayes led the NBA in free throw percentage three times: in 1958 (.904), 1960 (.892) and 1962 (.896). In 1959, he scored a career-high 50 points in a game against the Celtics. In the NBA, he didn&#x27;t miss a single game from February 17, 1952, to December 26, 1961, an NBA-record streak of 706 games. In 1960–61, he again led the league in free throws (with 680). In 1961, he became the first player in NBA history to amass 30,000 career total PRA (Points + Rebounds + Assists).

===NBA career achievements===
Schayes was the first person in the NBA to ever surpass 15,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.

A 12-time NBA All-Star, Schayes was a six-time All-NBA First Team honoree, and was also selected to the All-NBA Second Team six times. He came in second in MVP voting in 1958, and 5th in both 1956 and 1957. When he retired in 1964, he held the NBA records for games played (996), foul shots made (6,712), attempted (7,904), personal fouls (3,432) and was second to Bob Pettit in scoring (18,438) and third in rebounds (11,256).

==Coaching career and referee supervisor==
===Philadelphia 76ers (1963–1966)===
When the Nationals moved to Philadelphia in 1963 as the Philadelphia 76ers, Schayes became player-coach. However, his playing career had all but ended; he only played in 24 games, the only time in his career in which he played in fewer than 50 games. He didn&#x27;t play at all during the playoffs.

Schayes retired as a player after the season but stayed on as coach for three more seasons. He was named NBA Coach of the Year in 1966. That season, he led the Sixers to the Eastern Division regular-season title, ending a nine-year reign by the Boston Celtics. However, the Celtics ousted the Sixers in a five-game Eastern final, and Schayes was fired. He was succeeded by his predecessor with the Nats, Alex Hannum, who led the team to the best record in league history at the time and an NBA title.

From 1966 to 1970, Schayes was the supervisor of NBA referees. He was named the first coach of the Buffalo Braves in 1970, but was fired one game into his second season.

===Maccabiah Games coach===
Schayes coached the US Maccabiah Games basketball team to an upset win to take the gold medal in the 1977 Maccabiah Games. He also coached the U.S. Masters basketball team at the 1993 Maccabiah Games. He also played an active role raising money for the Maccabiah Games.

==Personal life==
Schayes settled in Syracuse, New York, in 1948, where he first played in the NBA, and where he was a real estate developer after his playing days.

Schayes&#x27; son is retired NBA center Danny Schayes, who played for Jamesville-DeWitt High School, in DeWitt, New York; Syracuse University; and in the NBA for 18 seasons. His granddaughters Abi, Carla, and Rachel Goettsch won silver medals for the United States volleyball team at the 2001 Maccabiah Games, and his grandson Mickey Ferri won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2005 Maccabiah Games.

Schayes died of cancer on December 10, 2015, at the age of 87. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse.

==Legacy==
In 1970, Schayes was elected to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team as one of the top 12 retired players.

In 1972, Schayes was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, the US National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the National Jewish American Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1996, Schayes was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.

In May 2015, Schayes was inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame, where he received a street named in his honor, called &quot;Dolph Schayes Street&quot;.

The 76ers retired Schayes&#x27; jersey on March 12, 2016, while the Syracuse Crunch retired it on March 26, 2016.

In 2021, Schayes was elected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Schayes as the 61st greatest player in NBA history.

<doc id="468210" wikidata="Q1192826" url="?curid=468210" title="Cummerbund">
<text>A cummerbund is a broad waist sash, usually pleated, which is often worn with single-breasted dinner jackets (or &quot;tuxedos&quot;). The cummerbund was adopted by British military officers in colonial India, where they saw it worn by sepoys (Indian soldiers) of the British Indian Army. It was adopted as an alternative to the waistcoat, and later spread to civilian use. The modern use of the cummerbund to Europeans and North Americans is as a component of the traditional black tie Western dress code.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;cummerbund&quot; is the Anglicized form of Hindustani &quot;kamarband&quot; (Hindustani: कमरबंद; ), which originated from the Persian (). It entered English vocabulary in 1616 from India. It is a combination of the words &quot;kamar&quot; meaning &#x27;waist&#x27; and &quot;band&quot; meaning &#x27;to close&#x27; or &#x27;fasten&#x27; (not to be confused with ‘band’ from Old Norse, reinforced in late Middle English by Old French bande, of Germanic origin; related to bind). The &#x27;waist-band&#x27; was a sash accessory worn by Indian men for many occasions.

The word &quot;cummerband&quot; (see below), and less commonly the German spelling (a Germanized spelling variation of the English word), are often used synonymously with &quot;cummerbund&quot; in English.

==Description==
===Form and occasion===

The form of the cummerbund is a wide band around the waist. The fastening is a ribbon around the back, tied or held shut by a buckle or velcro. The contemporary use of the cummerbund is purely aesthetic, providing a transition between the shirt and the waistband. They have also expanded in less formal situations into use with components of white tie, particularly by musicians, who sometimes wear a white cummerbund instead of the traditional piqué waistcoat.

===Pleats===
The pleats face up because they were originally used to hold ticket stubs and similar items, explaining the slang name &#x27;crumb-catcher&#x27;. However, the cummerbunds worn as part of the US Army Blue Mess and Blue Evening Mess uniforms are worn with the pleats down, as prescribed by Army Regulation 670–1 Chapter 24 Section 10(b). The US Navy Uniform Regulations NAVPERS 15665 stipulate the cummerbund be worn with the pleats up for the Navy Dinner Dress Jacket. 

===Colours===
Its origin as part of black tie determined the acceptable colours. It was adopted as civilian dress, beginning as a largely summer option with informal dinner jackets, such as Burmese fawn and white, later, it was restricted to the narrow range of colours which accompany black tie. These were predominantly black, sometimes midnight blue to match the trousers, and occasionally maroon (the normal hue for coloured accessories). In contemporary use, it is now common to see coloured bow ties and cummerbunds, often matching, but this is considered non-traditional.

== Military cummerbunds ==
Most units of the French Army of Africa wore cummerbunds of two different colours: blue for the European soldiers of the Zouaves and Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique; and red for the native Spahis and Tirailleurs. Some modern French regiments with a colonial history origin, still retain cummerbunds as part of their full dress uniform (notably the French Foreign Legion and the Spahis).

Cummerbunds (kamarbands) were an accessory to the dress uniform used in several modern South Asian armies, including the Indian Army, the Pakistan Army and the Bangladesh Army. It is generally worn during ceremonial parades and dinners. The colour or combination of colours varies widely according to regiment or corps.

Unlike the civilian cummerbund, a leather belt is worn above this cloth piece and one end hangs free displaying an ornamental fringe.

== Athletic cummerbunds ==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, cotton cummerbunds were commonly worn by athletes participating in gymnastic and/or combat sport training and competition.

== Cummerbunds in scuba diving ==
A &quot;cummerbund&quot; is also an informal word used in scuba diving to mean a wide waistband either on a buoyancy control device designed to provide more comfort to the user than a standard waistband and usually made of a stout fabric backed with velcro fastenings, or on a two-piece dry suit where a flexible rubber waistband helps to maintain a watertight seal between the jacket and the pants of the suit.

== In women dresses ==
In some cases cummerbund can be worn as an element of an evening dress.

<text>Vlaho Bukovac (; ; 4 July 1855 – 23 April 1922) was a Croatian painter and academic. His life and work were eclectic, for the artist pursued his career in a variety of locales and his style changed greatly over the course of that career. He is probably best known for his 1887 nude &quot;Une fleur&quot; (&quot;A Flower&quot;), which he created during his French period and which received attention in various reviews and publications during his lifetime. Bukovac was the court painter for Obrenović dynasty, Karađorđević dynasty and Petrović-Njegoš dynasty. In Zagreb, he is probably best known as the painter of the 1895 theatre curtain in the Croatian National Theatre.

==Biography==
Bukovac was born Biagio Faggioni in the town of Cavtat south of Dubrovnik in Dalmatia. While his mother was of Croatian descent, his paternal grandfather was an Italian sailor from the Genoa area who experienced a shipwreck near Cavtat. Like that he met a local girl Ana Kličan, Bukovac&#x27;s grandmother, with whom he married and settled in Cavtat. When he was eleven, he left with his uncle Frano for New York, where he stayed for four years before returning to his parents. Soon after, he found employment as a sailor, traveling on the Istanbul-Liverpool-Odessa route, however, his nautical career was soon cut short due to injuries sustained during a fall on the ship. While recovering at home, he began to paint. In 1873 he and his brother Jozo left for Peru, where he lived for a year selling his paintings before moving to California in 1874.

In San Francisco, he began an amateur career in painting, and received his first lessons in art from Domenico Tojetti. He painted many portraits, including multiple for the family of wealthy businessman William Dunphy, owner of the Rancho Posa de los Ositos.

In 1877, Faggioni returned to Europe to study painting, and in this time began using the surname Bukovac, a translation of the Italian word &quot;faggio&quot; meaning beech. He received his artistic education in Paris where he was financially supported by patrons Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Medo Pucić. He became a student at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts in Paris studying under the famed French artist Alexandre Cabanel. Dubrovnik-based Serb trader Petar Marić also assisted him financially, and Bukovac later painted a portrait of him and his family.

In 1892 he married Jelica Pitarević from Dubrovnik. They had one son and three daughters.
He would become a correspondent member of the Czech Academy of Sciences, an honorary member of Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (JAZU) and also a member of Serbian Royal Academy. He died in Prague where he studied and taught art.

===Early career===

Bukovac began his career in France. He painted in a &quot;sugary&quot; realistic style, his fashionable paintings achieved great success at the Paris Salon. During his time in France, he often traveled to England and the Dalmatian coast, where he was born. From the mid-1880s to World War I, regularly visited England, where many of his pictures were sold by the London art dealers Vicars Brothers, including &quot;The White Slave&quot; in 1884. During his time in England, Bukovac gained the patronage of Samson Fox of Harrogate and Richard LeDoux of Liverpool, whose support would elevate him in British society and in the art scene.
Samson Fox had bought &quot;Suffer the Little Children to Come to Me&quot;, exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1888, which was later presented to St. Robert&#x27;s Church in Harrogate.

===Courts of Serbia, Montenegro===
Bukovac was the court painter for Obrenović dynasty and Karađorđević dynasty. For his portrait of Natalie of Serbia he was awarded Order of the Cross of Takovo. He was also awarded Order of St. Sava.

Bukovac visited Kingdom of Montenegro several times and painted member of the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty and other members of the elite. He was awarded Order of Prince Danilo I for his work.

Some of his painting are a part of the collection of Museum of Fine Arts of Montenegro.

===Croatia and Prague===

Bukovac became a significant representative of fine arts in Zagreb, Croatia from 1893–97, bringing with him the spirit of French art. These new directives are most evident in his landscapes. He then began using a palette of lively and lighter colors using liberated strokes, soft rendering and the introduction of light on the painting canvas. Several examples of his work are in the Golden Hall of the Hermann Bollé-built palace on Opatička Street (today the Croatian Institute of History), where Izidor Kršnjavi commissioned Croatian artists to paint historical scenes and allegorical compositions in high relief.

In 1895, Bukovac completed one of his best known works, the theatre curtain in the Croatian National Theatre, &quot;The Reformation of Croatian Literature and Art&quot;. In his time in Zagreb, he became a leader at many important cultural and artistic events. In December 1893, Bukovac and Izidor Kršnjavi opened an exhibition titled &quot;Croatian Salon&quot; (&quot;Hrvatski salon&quot;), displaying the works of many of the top Croatian artists of the time. A few years later, Bukovac had his residence and atelier built on King Tomislav Square, and in 1895 he founded and became the first president of the &quot;Croatian Society of Artists&quot; (). The organization&#x27;s statute only allowed Croats who had successfully presented their collections at three different art exhibitions. Therefore the original members were well known artists: Oskar Alexander, Robert Auer, Ivo Bauer, Menci Clement Crnčić, Bela Čikoš, Robert Frangeš, Ferdo Kovačević, Viktor Kovačić, and Rudolf Valdec.

As president of the Croatian Society of Artists, he was among those who formerly opened the beautiful new Art Pavilion in Zagreb in December 1898. He gave a speech thanking the city council for building the pavilion on behalf of Croatian artists. During this time, he felt satisfaction and enthusiasm in Zagreb that he had not felt in a while. He dedicated much time and energy to his new students, one of which was noted Croatian painter Mirko Rački. However, due to controversy over the opening of the Croatian Salon, he withdrew to his native Cavtat where he stayed from 1898 to 1902.

In 1903 he moved to Prague, where he was appointed associate professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He introduced pointillism to the Prague Academy, and earned his historical reputation as an excellent pedagogue.

In 1908 he was elected president of the Association of Croatian Artists &quot;Medulić&quot; in Split. From 1912–13, Bukovac painted &quot;Development of Croatian Culture&quot; (&quot;Razvitak Hrvatske Kulture&quot;) for the main reading room in the Croatian State Archives. In 1918, he published his autobiography &quot;My Life&quot; (&quot;Moj život&quot;) in Zagreb.

==Legacy==
Besides being an artist who followed the established canons dictated by the salon and the general public, he followed his own inner impulses of artistic creation. Liberated artistic expression, which was called Impressionism, developed in the spirit of the artists who kept gathering in modernism-oriented marginal galleries in Paris in the 1870s. He knew the spirit of academia and, on the other hand, he felt the spirit of Impressionistic freedom. Having accepted modern principles, Bukovac painted casual pictures, using liberated strokes of the brush, in the pointillist technique.

His childhood home in Cavtat was made a museum called the Bukovac House, and is part of the Museums and Galleries of Konavle. The museum holds a wide collection of Bukovac’s works, from portraits and paintings during his days in Paris, Zagreb, Cavtat, and Prague.

In addition to artwork, the museum contains many of Bukovac&#x27;s personal objects, sketches, private letters, photographs, and a manuscript of his autobiography &quot;My life&quot; published in 1918. Also, Bukovac&#x27;s work can be found in the collection of Milan Jovanović Stojimirović who bequeathed a large number of paintings, sketches and artifacts to the Art Department of the Museum in Smederevo.

In 2006, Bukovac&#x27;s painting &quot;Une fleur&quot; (identified as &quot;Reclining Nude&quot; by the auction house) sold at Bonhams in London for £100,800.

<doc id="468215" wikidata="Q1980609" url="?curid=468215" title="Ballata">
<text>The ballata (plural: &quot;ballate&quot;) is an Italian poetic and musical form in use from the late 13th to the 15th century. It has the musical form AbbaA, with the first and last stanzas having the same texts. It is thus most similar to the French musical &#x27;forme fixe&#x27; virelai (and not the ballade as the name might otherwise suggest). The first and last &quot;A&quot; is called a &quot;ripresa&quot;, the &quot;b&quot; lines are &quot;piedi&quot; (feet), while the fourth line is called a &quot;volta&quot;. Longer ballate may be found in the form AbbaAbbaA, etc. 
Unlike the virelai, the two &quot;b&quot; lines usually have exactly the same music and only in later ballate pick up the (formerly distinctly French) first and second (open and close) endings. The term comes from the verb &quot;ballare&quot;, to dance, and the form certainly began as dance music.

The ballata was one of the most prominent secular musical forms during the trecento, the period often known as the Italian &quot;ars nova&quot;. Ballate are sung at the end of each day of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (only one musical setting of these poems, by Lorenzo da Firenze, survives). Early ballate, such as those found in the Rossi Codex are monophonic. Later, ballate are found for two or three voices. The most notable composer of ballate is Francesco Landini, who composed in the second half of the 14th century. Other composers of ballata include Andrea da Firenze, a contemporary of Francesco Landini, as well as Bartolino da Padova, Johannes Ciconia, Prepositus Brixiensis and Zacara da Teramo. In the 15th century both Arnold de Lantins and Guillaume Dufay wrote ballate; they were among the last to do so.

<text>The Catskill Mountains, also known as the Catskills, are a physiographic province and subrange of the larger Appalachian Mountains, located in southeastern New York. As a cultural and geographic region, the Catskills are generally defined as those areas close to or within the borders of the Catskill Park, a forest preserve protected from many forms of development under New York state law.

Geologically, the Catskills are a mature dissected plateau, a flat region subsequently uplifted and eroded into sharp relief by watercourses. The Catskills form the northeastern end of the Allegheny Plateau (also known as the Appalachian Plateau).

The Catskills were named by early Dutch settlers. They are well known in American society as the setting for films and works of art, including many 19th-century Hudson River School paintings, as well as for being a favored destination for vacationers from New York City in the mid-20th century. The region&#x27;s many large resorts gave many young stand-up comedians an opportunity to hone their craft. Since the late 19th century, the Catskills have been a haven for artists, musicians and writers, especially in and around the towns of Woodstock and Phoenicia.

== History ==
== Etymology ==
Nicolaes Visscher I&#x27;s 1656 map of New Netherland located the &#x27; at the mouth of Catskill Creek. The region to the south is identified as &#x27; (High Lands of the Esopus), a reference to a local band of northern Lenape Native Americans who inhabited the banks of the Hudson and hunted in the highlands along the Esopus Creek.

While the meaning of the name (&quot;cat creek [&quot;kill&quot;]&quot; in Dutch) and the namer (early Dutch explorers) are settled matters, how and why the area is named &quot;Catskills&quot; is a mystery. Mountain lions (catamounts) were known to have been in the area when the Dutch arrived in the 17th century and may have been a reason for the name.

The confusion over the origins of the name led over the years to variant spellings such as &quot;Kaatskill&quot; and &quot;Kaaterskill&quot;, both of which are also still used: the former in the regional magazine &quot;Kaatskill Life&quot;, the latter as the name of a mountain peak and a waterfall. Henry Schoolcraft is supposed to have coined the indigenous term for the range, &quot;On-ti-o-ra&quot; (&quot;mountains/hills/land of the sky&quot;), in 1844, due to the term not being attested prior to his record of it 

==Geography==
The Catskill Mountains are approximately north-northwest of New York City and southwest of Albany, starting west of the Hudson River. The Catskills occupy much of two counties (Greene and Ulster), and extend slightly into Delaware, Sullivan, and southwestern Schoharie counties.

At the range&#x27;s eastern end, the mountains begin dramatically with the Catskill Escarpment rising up suddenly from the Hudson Valley. The western boundary is far less certain, as the mountains gradually decline in height and grade into the rest of the Allegheny Plateau, but maps from the 18th and 19th centuries consistently mark the border of the Catskill Mountains as the East Branch of the Delaware River, which is consistent with the actual topographic relief. The Pocono Mountains, to the immediate southwest in Pennsylvania, are also a part of the Allegheny Plateau.

The Catskills contain more than 30 peaks above and parts of six important rivers. The Catskill Mountain 3500 Club is an organization whose members have climbed all the peaks in the Catskills over . The highest mountain, Slide Mountain in Ulster County, has an elevation of .
Climatically, the Catskills lie within the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Catskill Mountains have two climate zones. The vast majority of the Catskills have a warm summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) with some isolated locations in valleys with hot summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;). The plant hardiness zone on Slide Mountain at is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of . The plant hardiness zone in Margaretville at is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of .

The Catskill Mountains also is a temperate rainforest Every temperate rainforest on a map - minefield Is New York State Home To A Massive Rainforest? and meets all 4 of the criteria in Alaback’s definition of what qualifies or defines a temperate rainforest. 

1. Averages at least 55 inches of precipitation per year with at least 10% of its average annual precipitation during the summer months.SLIDE MTN, NEW YORK - Climate Summary

2. Cool, frequently overcast summers with average July temperature less than 16 degrees Celsius (60.8 degrees Fahrenheit)

3. Infrequent forest fires/wildfires and fires do not play an important role in shaping the ecology or ecosystem of the forest

4. Dormant season caused by lower temperature or even occasional snow. 

For the first criteria, majority areas within the Catskill Mountains do indeed average at least 55 inches of precipitation annually and summer is the wettest season hence it by far meets the criteria of at least 10% of its average annual precipitation during the summer months. Slide Mountain and nearby Hunter Mountain average about 63 inches of precipitation annually and most areas within the Catskills still average at least 55 inches annually.New York Climate For the 2nd criteria, summers in the Catskills are indeed cooler, not as hot and frequently cloudy, overcast, and foggy and even frequently chilly overnight as soon as the sun goes down. The tops of the mountains also meet the criteria of average July temperature less than 16 degrees Celsius (60.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in July. The top of Slide Mountain for example has an average July temperature of 60.3 degrees Fahrenheit which is less than 16 degrees Celsius (60.8 degrees Fahrenheit). As for the 3rd criteria, forest fires or wildfires also are very rare and many places within the Catskills which have never had any forest fires ever before and many the trees and ecology of the forest is old and untainted by wildfires or forest fires have not played any significant role in the ecology or ecosystem of the forest with the exception of Native Americans who did prescribed burning in some areas in order to create land for farming.Is New York State Home To A Massive Rainforest? And of course it also meets the 4th criteria of dormant season caused by lower temperatures in the winter and snow is very common in the winter
 
==Geology==

Although the Catskills are sometimes compared with the Adirondack Mountains farther north, the two mountain ranges are not geologically related, as the Adirondacks are a continuation of the Canadian Shield. Similarly, the Shawangunk Ridge, which forms the southeastern edge of the Catskills, is part of the geologically distinct Ridge-and-Valley province and is a continuation of the same ridge known as Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey and Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania.

The Catskill Mountains are more of a dissected plateau than a series of mountain ranges. The sediments that make up the rocks in the Catskills were deposited when the ancient Acadian Mountains in the east were rising and subsequently eroding. The sediments traveled westward and formed a great delta into the sea that was in the area at that time. The escarpment of the Catskill Mountains is near the former (landward) edge of this delta, as the sediments deposited in the northeastern areas along the escarpment were deposited above sea level by moving rivers, and the Acadian Mountains were located roughly where the Taconic Mountains are located today (though significantly larger). Finer sediment was deposited further westward, and thus the rocks change from gravel conglomerates to sandstone and shale. Further west, these fresh water deposits intermingle with shallow marine sandstone and shale until the end, in deeper water limestone.

The uplift and erosion of the Acadian Mountains was occurring during the Devonian and early Mississippian period (395 to 325 million years ago). Over that time, thousands of feet of these sediments built up, slowly moving the Devonian seashore further west. A meteor impact occurred in the shallow sea approximately 375 mya, creating a diameter crater. This crater eventually filled with sediments and became Panther Mountain through the process of uplift and erosion. By the middle of the Mississippian period, the uplift stopped, and the Acadian Mountains had been eroded so much that sediments no longer flowed across the Catskill Delta.
Over time, the sediments were buried by more sediments from other areas, until the original Devonian and Mississippian sediments were deeply buried and slowly became solid rock. Then the entire area experienced uplift, which caused the sedimentary rocks to begin to erode. Today, those upper sedimentary rocks have been completely removed, exposing the Devonian and Mississippian rocks. Today&#x27;s Catskills are a result of the continued erosion of these rocks, both by streams and, in the recent past, by glaciers.

In successive ice ages, both valley and continental glaciers have widened the valleys and the notches of the Catskills and rounded the mountains. Grooves and scratches in exposed bedrock provide evidence of the great sheets of ice that once traversed the region. Even today the erosion of the mountains continues, with the region&#x27;s rivers and streams deepening and widening the mountains&#x27; valleys and cloves.

==Recreation==

===The Borscht Belt===
In the mid–20th century, summer resorts in the Catskills, nicknamed the Borscht Belt, were a major vacation destination for Jewish New Yorkers. At its peak of popularity, about 500 resorts operated in the region. Later changes in vacationing patterns have led most of those travelers elsewhere, although there are still some bungalow communities and summer camps in the region catering to Orthodox populations.

===Aquatic sports and recreation===
Esopus Creek is a tributary of the Hudson River, starting at Winnisook Lake on Slide Mountain. It flows across Ulster County to the Hudson River at Saugerties. The Esopus is noted for making an almost 270-degree turn around Panther Mountain, following a buried impact crater rim. It is famous for tubing, a sport of rafting down a river in an inner tube. Many tubers begin their trip at Phoenicia, New York, and head down the creek towards the Ashokan Reservoir at Olive, New York.

The Ashokan Reservoir is part of the New York City water supply system, with fishing allowed under permit, but ice fishing is prohibited. It is the most famous New York City-owned reservoir for rainbow trout.

River canoeing and kayaking are popular. There are 42 rapids ranging from class I to V+.

The Esopus Creek is famous for its fly fishing, although in recent years it has been plagued by invasive plants.

===Cycling===
Road and mountain biking are fairly popular in the range. Bicycle racing includes the Tour of the Catskills, a three-day road stage race held in Green and Ulster counties each summer, and the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in Windham. Other cycling resources include the Catskill Scenic Trail, the Headwaters Trails in Stamford and the Roundtopia trail network (mapped by the Round Top Mountain Bike Association). Several ski centers provide downhill mountain bicycling in the warmer months.

===Hiking and camping===
Within the range is the Catskill Park, comprising over . Catskill Park is part of New York&#x27;s Forest Preserve. Not all the land is publicly owned; about 60% remains in private hands, but new sections are added frequently. Most of the park and the preserve are within Ulster County, with a significant portion in Greene County, and parts in Sullivan and Delaware counties as well. Many of the trails in public areas are maintained and updated by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference and the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club. Devil&#x27;s Path is one of the many trails open for hikers. Spots to camp in the Catskills include Bear Spring Mountain, Little Pond, Mongaup Pond, and North-South Lake.

===Skiing===

There are five main downhill ski and snowboard areas in the Catskills: Belleayre Mountain (run by the Olympic Regional Development Authority); Hunter Mountain (the first ski area to install snowmaking machines in New York); Windham Mountain; Holiday Mountain Ski and Fun in Monticello; and Plattekill Mountain in Roxbury.

Joppenbergh Mountain, in Rosendale Village hosted its first ski jumping competition in 1937. Ski jumping was continued on the mountain until February 7, 1971, when the last competition was held.

The Mountain Trails Cross Country Ski Center in Tannersville has of trails.

==Structures==
===Fire towers===

The Catskill Mountains fire towers were constructed to facilitate forest fire prevention and control. Twenty-three fire towers were built in the Catskill Mountains between 1908 and 1950. The fire towers fell out of use by the 1970s as fire spotting from airplanes had become more effective and efficient, so the fire towers were decommissioned; the Hunter Mountain Fire Tower was the last to be taken out of service in 1990. 

Six remaining towers were renovated and opened to the public as observation posts with panoramic views and a tower was opened at the Catskill Visitor Center in 2022. In 2024 a tower was restored to Bramley Mountain, bringing the count to eight. The current towers are:

*Balsam Lake Mountain Fire Observation Station near Hardenburgh, elevation 
*Hunter Mountain Fire Tower near Hunter, elevation 
*Mt. Utsayantha Fire Tower near Stamford, New York, elevation 
*Overlook Mountain Tower near Woodstock, elevation 
*Red Hill Fire Observation Station near Denning, elevation 
*Mount Tremper Fire Observation Station near Shandaken, elevation 
*Upper Esopus Fire Observation Station near Mount Tremper, elevation 
*Bramley Mountain Fire Tower near Bloomville, elevation 

===Notable landmarks===
The Catskill Mountain House, built in 1824, was a hotel near Palenville, New York, in the Catskill Mountains overlooking the Hudson River Valley. In its prime at the turn of the century, visitors included United States Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt.

==Transportation==
From 1872, the northern part of the Catskills were served by the Catskill Mountain Branch of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad which was absorbed into the New York Central railroad in 1932. Oneonta to Kingston passenger rail service continued until 1954. Part of the line still exists but now serves only freight.

The southern part of the Catskills was served by the New York, Ontario and Western Railway. Over the course of 1950, service on the NYO&amp;W downscaled to summer only. In its last years it ran trains from Roscoe to Weehawken, New Jersey, via Liberty. It connected with the New York Central&#x27;s West Shore Railroad at Cornwall. This service lasted until September 10, 1953.

The Delaware and Ulster Railroad is a heritage railroad, based in Arkville, New York, that still runs a scenic part of the track from Highmount to Hubbell Corners, New York, for tourist use. The Catskill Mountain Railroad is also a heritage railroad in the Catskills, operating from Kingston up to Highmount.

The Catskills are accessible by automobile from the east along Interstate 87/New York State Thruway, which runs north–south through the Hudson Valley. To the south and southwest, the Catskills are accessible by a variety of highways, including New York State Route 55, U.S. Route 44, U.S. Route 209, and New York State Route 17. Access to the western Catskills is provided by New York State Route 30; and the vaguely defined far-western edge of the region is variously considered to be New York State Route 10 or Interstate 88, though this boundary remains a matter of local preference. New York State Routes 28 and 23A cut east–west through the heart of the Catskills, serving many of the most popular outdoor tourist destinations. New York State Route 23 runs east–west across the Catskills&#x27; northern section.

Governor Kathy Hochul supports plans for the New York State Department of Transportation to improve highway transportation for New York State car drivers driving on New York Route 17 in the New York Catskills Region. It will cost $1.3 billion. Environmentalists and transportation planners do not like the plan.

The closest major airports to the Catskill region are Albany International Airport to the north and Stewart International Airport in Newburgh to the south. Smaller airports in the region include:
* Columbia County Airport in Hudson
* Dutchess County Airport in Poughkeepsie
* Joseph Y. Resnick Airport in Ellenville
* Kingston–Ulster Airport
* Kobelt Airport in Wallkill
* Randall Airport in Middletown
* Sullivan County International Airport in Monticello
* Wurtsboro–Sullivan County Airport

==In popular culture==

The Catskills serve as the setting for many works of fiction, such as the short story Rip Van Winkle, and the children&#x27;s book &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot;. The Hudson Valley Film Commission maintains a list of films set in the Hudson Valley/Catskills Region. Of them, more than three dozen films are set in the Catskills.

The town of Bethel, New York, located in the Catskills, was home to the famous Woodstock music festival that took place August 15–18, 1969. The event, wherein 32 music acts performed in front of over 500,000 concert-goers, was captured in the documentary movie &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1970). The site is now home to the world-renowned Bethel Woods Center for the Arts.

The many hotels and vacation resorts located in the Catskills are notable in American cultural history for their role in the development of modern stand-up comedy. Comedians such as Rodney Dangerfield, Jackie Mason, Alan King, and Don Rickles all got their start performing in Catskill hotel venues colloquially referred to as the Borscht Belt.

<text>Anava () (from &quot;anu&quot;, meaning an atom or an exceedingly small entity) is a state - the consciousness of the ego, the sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. This represents a sense of individuality and a separation from a general existence of any &quot;divine plan&quot;. One of the three bondages or s: , karma and maya. In Shaivism, anava is the cause of the individual soul&#x27;s mistaken sense of separate identity from Universal God Shiva, and the last bond broken before union (yoga) or self-realization (moksha). The three bondages are also explicitly discussed in the tantras of Shaktism.

<text>The Little Red Lighthouse, officially Jeffrey&#x27;s Hook Light, is a small lighthouse located in Fort Washington Park along the Hudson River in Manhattan, New York City, under the George Washington Bridge. It was made notable by the 1942 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Little Red Lighthouse and The Great Gray Bridge&quot;, written by Hildegarde Swift and illustrated by Lynd Ward.

The lighthouse stands on Jeffrey&#x27;s Hook, a small point of land that supports the base of the eastern pier of the bridge, which connects Washington Heights in Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey.

==History==
The first attempt to reduce Hudson River traffic accidents at Jeffrey&#x27;s Hook was a red pole that was hung out over the river. A 10 candle-power light was added to the pole in 1889 to help alert the increasing river traffic to the spit of land at night. The land around Jeffrey&#x27;s Hook was acquired by the city in 1896 and later became Fort Washington Park.

The early structure was built as the North Hook Beacon at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where it stood until 1917, when it became obsolete. It was reconstructed at its current location in 1921 by the United States Lighthouse Board as part of a project to improve Hudson River navigational aids, and originally had a battery-powered lamp and a fog bell. It was operated by a part-time lighthouse keeper.

Construction on the George Washington Bridge, immediately above the lighthouse, started in 1927. When George Washington Bridge was completed in 1931, the lighthouse navigational light was considered obsolete, so the Coast Guard decommissioned it, and put it out in 1948, with the intention of auctioning it off. The proposed dismantling of it resulted in a public outcry, largely from children who were fans of the 1942 children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge&quot;. This led the Coast Guard to sign its deed to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation on July 23, 1951.

The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as &quot;Jeffrey&#x27;s Hook Lighthouse&quot; in 1979, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1991. In 2002, it was relit by the city.

==Access==
Public access to the lighthouse is by the Hudson River Greenway, reachable north of the George Washington Bridge by a footbridge across the Henry Hudson Parkway at West 182nd Street and Riverside Drive, and south of the bridge by a footbridge at West 158th Street or the newer Denny Farrell Greenway Bridge (a pedestrian and bicycle bridge) at 151st Street. The northern path is very steep immediately north of the bridge, while the southern path is flat.

There is also a very obscure pedestrian underpass at Riverside Drive parallel to 177th Street, just south of the George Washington Bridge. It empties out on the other side of the Henry Hudson Parkway and it&#x27;s a dirt path down to the lighthouse. This YouTube video gives directions for getting to and using this obscure path. A neighborhood group (Friends of J. Hood Wright Park), in partnership with the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation does monthly cleanups of this route.

There is yet another way to get to the Little Red Lighthouse from Washington Heights. This link shows the path using the Haven Ramp to the Little Red Lighthouse and then returns via this other path that takes you out to Riverside Drive on the west side of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. From there one can walk south to 165th Street.

Tours of the lighthouse are given infrequently. They are arranged by the Parks Department&#x27;s Urban Park Rangers, especially on the Little Red Lighthouse Festival day in late September and Open House New York day in October. The October Little Red Lighthouse Festivals in 2018 and 2019 were run by the organization Summer on the Hudson in conjunction with the Riverside Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The festival was not held in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it resumed in 2022.

== In other media ==
The lighthouse is an important setting in the final scenes for the 1948 film &quot;Force of Evil&quot;, and Jane Campion&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;In the Cut&quot; features the lighthouse as motif and as a filming location.

<text>Aorist ( ; abbreviated ) verb forms usually express perfective aspect and refer to past events, similar to a preterite. Ancient Greek grammar had the aorist form, and the grammars of other Indo-European languages and languages influenced by the Indo-European grammatical tradition, such as Middle Persian, Sanskrit, Armenian, the South Slavic languages, Georgian, Pontic Greek, and Pashto, also have forms referred to as aorist.

The word comes from Ancient Greek ( ), as the aorist was the unmarked (default) form of the verb, and thus did not have the implications of the imperfective aspect, which referred to an ongoing or repeated situation, or the perfect, which referred to a situation with a continuing relevance; instead it described an action &quot;pure and simple&quot;.

Because the aorist was the unmarked aspect in Ancient Greek, the term is sometimes applied to unmarked verb forms in other languages, such as the habitual aspect in Turkish.

==Indo-European languages==

===Proto-Indo-European===
In Proto-Indo-European, the aorist appears to have originated as a series of verb forms expressing manner of action. Proto-Indo-European had a three-way aspectual opposition, traditionally called &quot;present&quot;, &quot;aorist&quot;, and &quot;perfect&quot;, which are thought to have been, respectively, imperfective, perfective, and stative (resultant state) aspects. By the time of Classical Greek, this system was maintained largely in independent instances of the non-indicative moods and in the nonfinite forms. But in the indicative, and in dependent clauses with the subjunctive and optative, the aspects took on temporal significance. In this manner, the aorist was often used as an unmarked past tense, and the perfect came to develop a resultative use, which is why the term perfect is used for this meaning in modern languages. 

Other Indo-European languages lost the aorist entirely. In the development of Latin, for example, the aorist merged with the perfect. The preterites (past perfectives) of the Romance languages, which are sometimes called &quot;aorist&quot;, are an independent development.

===Greek===

In Ancient Greek, the indicative aorist is one of the two main forms used in telling a story; it is used for undivided events, such as the individual steps in a continuous process (narrative aorist); it is also used for events that took place before the story itself (past-within-past). The aorist indicative is also used to express things that happen in general, without asserting a time (the &quot;gnomic aorist&quot;). It can also be used of present and future events; the aorist also has several specialized senses meaning present action.

Non-indicative forms of the aorist (subjunctives, optatives, imperatives, infinitives) are usually purely aspectual, with certain exceptions including indirect speech constructions and the use of optative as part of the sequence of tenses in dependent clauses. There are aorist infinitives and imperatives that do not imply temporality at all. For example, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Matthew 6:11 uses the aorist imperative in &quot;Give ( ) us &quot;this day&quot; our daily bread&quot;, in contrast to the analogous passage in Luke 11:3, which uses the imperfective aspect, implying repetition, with &quot;Give ( , present imperative) us &quot;day by day&quot; our daily bread.&quot;

An example of how the aorist tense contrasts with the imperfect in describing the past occurs in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;, when the Persian aristocrat Orontas is executed: &quot;and those who had been previously in the habit of bowing ( , imperfect) to him, bowed ( , aorist) to him even then.&quot; Here the imperfect refers to a past habitual or repeated act, and the aorist to a single one.

There is disagreement as to which functions of the Greek aorist are inherent within it. Some of the disagreement applies to the history of the development of the various functions and forms. Most grammarians differentiate the aorist indicative from the non-indicative aorists. Many authors hold that the aorist tends to be about the past because it is perfective, and perfectives tend to describe completed actions; others that the aorist indicative and to some extent the participle is essentially a mixture of past tense and perfective aspect.

==== Hermeneutic implications ====
Because the aorist was not maintained in either Latin or the Germanic languages, there have long been difficulties in translating the Greek New Testament into Western languages. The aorist has often been interpreted as making a strong statement about the aspect or even the time of an event, when, in fact, due to its being the unmarked (default) form of the Greek verb, such implications are often left to context. Thus, within New Testament hermeneutics, it is considered an exegetical fallacy to attach undue significance to uses of the aorist. Although one may draw specific implications from an author&#x27;s use of the imperfective or perfect, no such conclusions can, in general, be drawn from the use of the aorist, which may refer to an action &quot;without specifying whether the action is unique, repeated, ingressive, instantaneous, past, or accomplished.&quot; In particular, the aorist does not imply a &quot;once-for-all&quot; action, as it has commonly been misinterpreted, although it frequently refers to a simple, non-repeated action.

===Sanskrit===

Although quite common in older Sanskrit, the aorist is comparatively infrequent in much of classical Sanskrit, occurring, for example, 66 times in the first book of the Rāmāyaṇa, 8 times in the Hitopadeśa, 6 times in the Bhagavad-Gītā, and 6 times in the story of Śakuntalā in the Mahābhārata.

In the later language, the aorist indicative had the value of a preterite, while in the older language it was closer in sense to the perfect. The aorist was also used with the ancient injunctive mood, particularly in prohibitions.

===Slavic languages===

The Indo-European aorist was inherited by the Slavic languages but has survived intact only in the South Slavic languages. It retains its function entirely in the Eastern South Slavic languages, Bulgarian and Macedonian. However, in Western South Slavic languages it has become, along with the imperfect and pluperfect, largely obsolete in daily parlance and mostly superseded by the perfect and circumlocution. The aorist is part of the standardized varieties of Serbo-Croatian but is no longer part of standard Slovene. In both languages, the aorist appears mostly in older literature, scripture, religious services and legislation and so carries an archaic tone. In Serbo-Croatian, aorist finds natural use only in certain locales while it is completely supplanted by the perfect in others. As such, its use in formal settings can be construed as either pretentious and bombastic or conversely as rustic and unsophisticated, depending on locale. Its disuse does not cause ambiguity, as Slavic verbs have distinct grammatical aspects to convey related yet distinct meaning.

The prevalence of the aorist varied widely by region prior to the grammatical changes during the communists&#x27; rise to power in SFR Yugoslavia after World War II. Historically, in Croatia and Croatian dialects, the aorist was naturally displaced by the perfect in most dialects (Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian). In Serbia and Serbian dialects, the aorist was historically commonly used to describe the past. In 1933, the Serbian linguist Aleksandar Belić was tasked by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with creating a formal grammar for the new Serbo-Croatian standard. He decided to curb the use of the aorist by noting that there were many speakers of the language &quot;in Yugoslavia who rarely use aorist, or do not use it at all&quot;, alluding to primarily Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks and Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia whose dialects had long since done away with aorist altogether; Belić redefined aorist as a tense that described an action that happened &quot;immediately before the moment of speech&quot; despite the fact that aorist never carried such a meaning inherently among native speakers. In an effort to reinforce the use of the unified and standardized language in public discourse and education, the usage of the aorist gradually became prescriptively stigmatized by the communist regime and filtered from official use in PR Serbia and PR Montenegro. Belić&#x27;s redefinition and use of aorist in fiction writing was tolerated due to abundance of its use in older literature. Nevertheless, aorist is still widespread in rural parts of Serbia, especially among the older and less educated part of the population. In standardized forms, the aorist is used for witnessed actions from a specific time in the past, mostly with verbs of perfective aspect.

In modern forms of communication, the aorist has experienced something of a revival among younger speakers in Serbia, as its forms are simpler and shorter to type out than the perfect.

In Bulgarian, which has produced a new regular formation, the aorist is used in indirect and in presumptive quotations. Bulgarian has separate inflections for aorist (past imperfective) and general perfective. The aorist may be used with the imperfective to produce a compound perfective–imperfective aspect.

The aorist in Macedonian is called the &quot;past definite complete tense&quot; () and refers to a completed action in the past tense. It most often corresponds to the simple past tense in English: &quot;I read the book, I wrote the letter, I ate my supper&quot;, etc. In contemporary standard Macedonian, the aorist is formed almost exclusively from perfective verbs. The formation of the aorist for most verbs is not complex, but there are numerous small subcategories that must be learned. All verbs in the aorist (except ) take the same endings, but there are complexities in the aorist stem vowel and possible consonant alternations. All verbs (except ) take the following endings in the aorist:

(The sign ∅ indicates a zero ending: nothing is added after the stem vowel.)

===Morphology===
In the Indo-European languages Greek and Sanskrit, the aorist stem is marked by several morphological devices (the aorist indicative also has the past-tense augment &quot;e-&quot;, which contracts with the initial vowel). Three aorist morphological devices stand out as most common:

==South Caucasian languages==
In Georgian and Svan, the aorist marks perfective aspect. In the indicative, it marks completed events. In other moods, it marks events that are yet to be completed.

In Mingrelian and Laz, the aorist is basically a past tense and can be combined with both perfective and imperfective aspects as well as the imperative and the subjunctive moods.

==Northeast Caucasian languages==
In Khinalug, the aorist is a perfective aspect, and the two terms (&quot;aorist&quot; and &quot;perfective&quot;) are often used interchangeably.

In Udi, the aorist is an imperfective aspect that is usually a past tense but can also replace the present tense.

==Turkish==
In Turkish, the aorist (, literally &quot;broad time&quot;) is a habitual aspect and is similar to the English present simple. For example, the statement (&quot;I do not eat meat&quot;) informs the listener that the speaker is a vegetarian and not merely that they happen not to be eating meat at that very moment. To convey the latter message, the present progressive (&quot;I am not eating meat&quot;) would be appropriate. The Turkish aorist is commonly used in enquiries about someone&#x27;s wishes, as in (&quot;Would you like to eat something?&quot;). That makes a question like ambiguous, as the listener may interpret it as an informational question (&quot;Are you someone who eats pork&quot;?) or as an offer (&quot;Would you [like to] eat pork?&quot;).

==Constructed languages==
In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s constructed language Quenya, the aorist is a gnomic tense or simple present that expresses general facts or simple present actions.

<text>Keuka College is a private college in Keuka Park, New York, United States, situated on Keuka Lake. Founded in 1890, the college emphasizes experiential learning as well as career and pre-professional education. It is classified among &quot;Master&#x27;s Colleges and Universities (small)&quot; and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The college offers both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees.

Keuka&#x27;s Accelerated Studies for Adults Program (ASAP) offers degree completion at more than 20 sites throughout Upstate New York, as well as through online courses. Keuka has partnered with universities in China and Vietnam, with more than 3,000 students pursuing Keuka degrees.

The lake-front school has more than a thousand feet of shoreline, including Point Neamo, a private beach with a boat house and equipment for checkout by college students and staff.
==History==
Keuka College was founded in 1890 by George Harvey Ball (1819-1907) who envisioned a college that would provide a high-level education to all deserving students, regardless of economic background. The first academic building was dedicated on August 14, 1890. In an article published the next day, The New York Times noted that the hall was built on &quot;one of the most beautiful locations on the Keuka Lake,&quot; and that it was &quot;a firm-looking building, four stories in height, of brick and stone.&quot; The freshman class in Fall 1890 consisted of eighty students.

The college faced financial troubles and decided to suspend active instruction in 1915.

=== Reopening ===
In 1919, Arthur H. Norton, after whom the Norton Chapel is named, was chosen as the President of Keuka. Under Norton, who would serve as president for the next 16 years, Keuka resumed instruction in 1921 as Keuka College for Women. During this trying time, Norton personally wrote more than 3,000 letters, published and mailed at least 10,000 pamphlets, made 66 speeches, and surveyed 76 colleges in order to advance Keuka&#x27;s cause. Gertrude Martin, former dean of women at Cornell University, became a Keuka trustee and advised the now women&#x27;s college.The Ball Brothers—founders of what would become the Ball Corporation, a S&amp;P 500 company, and benefactors of Ball State University—were among the key supporters of Keuka at this time. Years earlier, with their father in poor health, the young Ball brothers &quot;found a friend and confidant in their uncle,&quot; George Harvey Ball. When the Ball brothers&#x27; father, Lucius Styles Ball, died, Uncle George provided financial support and some measure of stability to the young Ball brothers. George Harvey Ball also provided his nephews with funds that helped launch their successful enterprise. The Ball brothers expressed their gratitude to their uncle by supporting Keuka College, donating land and providing funds. In recognition of this, the first academic building was renamed Ball Hall in 1921 after founder and first President George Harvey Ball and the Ball Brothers In 1924, Hegeman Hall and Richardson Hall (later renamed Harrington Hall) were built. Both of these buildings remain key buildings on campus today, flanking Ball Hall.

During World War II, Keuka College expanded its nursing program in order to provide professionally trained nurses for the war effort, due in no small part to the personal correspondence between Keuka President J. Hillis Miller and the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. Keuka&#x27;s emphasis on experiential learning meant that it had a nursing program combining &quot;academic study in the classroom and clinical work at the hospital.&quot;

=== Co-education ===
Keuka remained a women&#x27;s college until 1985, when declining enrollment at that time, from 536 total students in 1979 to 407 students in 1984, caused the board of trustees to vote in favor of admitting men. Since then, enrollment has increased to over 1,100 students .

In the late 2000s, with the help of donations from alumni and friends of the college, the original building, Ball Hall, was restored. The three-year renovation of the historical centerpiece of the campus received a Citation Award from the American Institute for Architects-Central New York (AIA CNY) in 2008.

In 2016, the Keuka Commons was dedicated. This new building houses the Division of Business and Management, the Center for Professional Studies, the Wertman Office of Digital Education, the Center for Business Analytics and Health Informatics, a state-of-the-art trading room, classrooms, study spaces, the campus bookstore, and the Wolf Den Café, which serves Starbucks coffee as well as pastries, sandwiches, salads, and other snacks.

In 2021, the college was sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors &quot;for infringement of governance standards&quot;.

== Academics ==
Keuka College offers 29 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and 27 minors and self-designed majors. In addition, Keuka offers seven master&#x27;s degree programs and a pre-professional program in health science.

Keuka has an international presence, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with around 2,680 Chinese students pursuing Keuka degrees at four partner universities, one of the largest enrollments of any U.S. college operating in the country. The Keuka-China international educational partnership has the approval of the Office of Academic Degrees Committee for the State Council in China. Another 505 Vietnamese students are doing likewise at two partner universities in Vietnam. More than 110 international students from different countries study on the home campus.

=== Academic Success at Keuka (ASK) ===
In addition to providing services to students with disabilities, ASK is also available to help all students enhance study skills, improve time management, and earn better grades through peer and professional tutoring in writing and other subjects.

===Adult education===
The Keuka College Center for Professional Studies Accelerated Studies for Adults Program (ASAP) offers degree completion and master&#x27;s programs for working students. Classes are held one evening a week at community college and hospital locations throughout Upstate New York, including Syracuse, Auburn, Corning, Rochester, and other locations. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees can be earned in management, criminal justice, nursing for RNs, and social work. Master&#x27;s degrees are available in criminal justice administration, management, and nursing.

=== Center for Aquatic Research (CAR) ===

The Center capitalizes on Keuka College&#x27;s excellent location on the shore of Keuka Lake and engages in research, teaching, and outreach. Research has been conducted on the ecological impacts from deep chlorophyll layers (DCL) in Keuka Lake. CAR researchers have worked with researchers from Cornell University, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and Finger Lakes Community College and other institutions on a state-funded project that investigates water quality issues on Owasco Lake. CAR researchers have also presented their findings at regional and national scientific conferences. In addition, the center hosts summer workshops for area high school science teachers as well as people interested in the aquatic ecology of Keuka Lake and of the larger Finger Lakes region. CAR has had an international aquatic research partnership with Wenzhou University on the east coast of China.

=== Center for Experiential Learning ===
The Center for Experiential Learning serves as a bridge, connecting internships, the classroom and co-curricular activities, into a mutually reinforcing learning network. Interns have worked in local and out-of-state hospitals, schools, day care centers, set up Web sites for nonprofit groups, connecting lessons in video art with the digital nuts and bolts of the workplace; accounting majors have helped with auditing at major companies, including KPMG, one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; auditors in the world. Experiential Learning is the central focus of the student experience, which gives students the Keuka advantage, namely, real-world experience for the 21st century, enabling them to build up ties, skill sets, and experiences even before they graduate and enter the world force or graduate or professional programs. Experiential learning at Keuka occurs in the classroom, co-curricular activities, the workplace, and the community. It is integrated and weaves throughout the four years, and begins day one.

==== Field Period ====
In 1942, Edith Estey, a 1933 Keuka graduate and administrator, created the Field Period program, which continues to be a major component of a Keuka College education as administered through the Center for Experiential Learning. During a Field Period, each Keuka student is required to spend 140 hours per year or approximately one month in a self-directed learning experience. This can involve a work internship, a community service project, spiritual exploration, personal development, cross-cultural diversity exploration, or a group cultural experience to another city or country.

The student is graded on a pass and fail basis with the potential to earn three credits. The Field Period can be completed over summer break or winter break, as students have the month of January off. Students design a learning contract with the site of their choice that outlines learning goals and objectives that must be met. Each student&#x27;s site supervisor evaluates the student&#x27;s work ethic and progress and reports back to Keuka College&#x27;s Experiential Learning office. Upon completion, students meet with their academic advisors to present unique documentation of the experience and hand in a recap paper and reflective journal.

=== Center for Global Education ===
The Center serves Keuka students on the Keuka Lake home campus who look for opportunities to study abroad, or for information about the college&#x27;s many international ties. It also serves international students looking to study at Keuka College in the United States, and Keuka China or Keuka Vietnam students interested in Keuka College&#x27;s exchange programs.

=== Lightner Library and the Aben and Lightner Art Galleries ===
The Lightner Library houses books, journals, computer labs, and electronic resources. It is also home to two art galleries. The Robert S. &amp; Rebecca Bannan Aben Gallery features the work of world-renowned artist Yankel Ginzburg. The Ginzburg art was donated to the college by the Aben Family. The Lightner Art Gallery has showcased the works of local and regional artists, as well as those of Keuka students, on a rotating, monthly basis for the past 25 years.

== Athletics ==
Keuka College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. They are a member of the Empire 8 Conference and of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). They formerly competed as a member of the North Eastern Athletic Conference (NEAC), now known as the United East Conference. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, field hockey and volleyball.

They were known as the Storm until 2014, and then adopted the nickname the &quot;Wolfpack&quot;. Following the 2016 threat of a lawsuit by North Carolina State University, Keuka College decided to forego litigation and discontinue the &quot;Wolfpack&quot; name, renaming themselves the &quot;Wolves.&quot;

<text>Human Resources Development Canada (, HRDC) was a department of the Government of Canada with the responsibility over a wide portfolio of social services.

HRDC was based at a government office facility at Place du Portage IV in Gatineau (formerly downtown Hull, Quebec).

==History==
HRDC was created in 1993 by Prime Minister Kim Campbell&#x27;s government in an attempt to decrease the size of the federal cabinet by grouping several departments with similar responsibilities. In the case of HRDC, the former Department of Employment and Immigration formed its nucleus.

HRDC&#x27;s creation was probably the most enduring decision taken by Campbell&#x27;s short-lived administration. The new department, however was poorly focused and had a wide range of institutional cultures from the merged bureaucracies; it also had one of the larger departmental budgets and a variety of responsibilities ranging from the unemployment insurance program to the issuance of social insurance numbers and job training and counselling.

Although HRDC was operationally functional since 1993, the &quot;Department of Human Resources Development Act&quot; was not adopted until 29 May 1996 and officially entered into force on 12 July 1996 when it received Royal Assent and was published in the Canada Gazette.

=== Department of Employment and Immigration ===
The Department of Employment and Immigration, in operation from 1977 to 1996, was the department that preceded HRDC and succeeded the Department of Manpower and Immigration.

The department was abolished on 12 July 1996. The role previously held by the Minister of Employment and Immigration in regard to labour was taken on by the Minister of Human Resources Development, while the portfolio for immigration was transferred to the office of Minister of Citizenship and Immigration following the reorganization of the government and formation of the department for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

===Dissolution (2003)===
HRDC was dissolved in a December 2003 government reorganization which saw two departments, the Department of Social Development and the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development created in its place. The two departments were re-amalgamated on February 6, 2006, though now named Employment and Social Development Canada.

== Ministers ==
The Minister of Human Resources Development was the Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet responsible for overseeing HRDC. Prior to 1996, the post was known as Minister of Employment and Immigration. In 2003, the portfolio was divided to create the posts of Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister of Social Development.
=== Minister of Employment and Immigration ===
The Minister of Employment and Immigration was an office in the Cabinet of Canada, in operation from 1977 to 1996, and was first held by Bud Cullen, who continued from his preceding role as the Minister of Manpower and Immigration.

On 12 July 1996, the office of the Minister of Employment and Immigration was abolished and replaced with the office of Minister of Human Resources Development. The portfolio for immigration was transferred to the office of Minister of Citizenship and Immigration following the reorganization of the government and formation of the department for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
==Controversies==
In the late 1990s, HRDC gained public headlines across Canada following numerous poorly thought procurements, notably dozens of server computers using the Unix operating system, this despite the fact that the purchase far exceeded the department&#x27;s computing requirements. Other problems relating to several incompatible email systems made HRDC a scapegoat for attacks on the government by opposition parties.

In 2000, HRDC&#x27;s poor accounting practices were made infamous by the Canadian Alliance when it was claimed that approximately $1 billion (CAD) in employment grants could not be accounted for. Peter Donolo later claimed that this scandal was &quot;phony&quot; and the true amount unaccounted for was $85,000.

<text>Jane Stewart, (born April 25, 1955) is a former Canadian politician who was the Minister of Human Resources Development from 1999 to 2003. She joined International Labour Organization in May 2004 and was the Special Representative and Director of the International Labour Organization&#x27;s office to the United Nations until January 2016.

==Life and career==
Born in Brantford, Ontario, Stewart was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 election. She was a friend of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, and was soon appointed to the important position of Minister of National Revenue and subsequently Minister of Indian Affairs. In 1999, she was moved to the Department of Human Resources Development (HRDC), the government department that had the largest budget.

Stewart was the minister when the opposition alleged a so-called &quot;billion-dollar boondoggle&quot;, where ineffective accounting practices at HRDC allegedly left millions of dollars unaccounted for. While the problems at HRDC mostly date from the time of her predecessor, Pierre Pettigrew, Stewart took the brunt of the attack but was also the Minister widely viewed to have cleaned up the mess left behind by her predecessor. She did not resign, and Chrétien stood by her throughout the ordeal.

She remained minister in charge of HRDC until Paul Martin became Prime Minister on December 12, 2003. She was moved to the backbenches because of her position as a loyalist to the ousted Chrétien. She retired from politics on February 13, 2004, to become an executive director of the International Labour Organization. In July 2005, she left her job with the ILO to return to Canada and marry businessman Henry Stolp. She later returned to ILO as its executive director, residing in New York City.

With the announcement that Martin was stepping down as leader of the Liberal Party, a group called &quot;Liberals for Jane&quot; had hoped to see Stewart seek the party leadership. This was ruled out when Stewart accepted the position of Chief of Staff to acting Leader of the Opposition, Bill Graham. Only weeks later, Stewart stepped down from the post due to family obligations. She was replaced by former cabinet minister Andy Mitchell.

From 2006 to May 2007 Stewart was chief negotiator for the province of Ontario in the Caledonia land dispute.

Stewart comes from a family of politicians. Her father Robert Nixon was leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, while her grandfather was Ontario premier Harry Nixon.

<text>The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church, also referred to as the Old Catholic Encyclopedia and the Original Catholic Encyclopedia, is an English-language encyclopedia about Catholicism published in the United States. It was designed &quot;to give its readers full and authoritative information on the entire cycle of Catholic interests, action and doctrine&quot;.

The first volume of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; appeared in March 1907 and the last three volumes appeared in 1912, followed by a master index volume in 1914 and later supplementary volumes. Its successor, the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, was first published by the Catholic University of America in 1967.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; was published by the Robert Appleton Company (RAC) in New York City. RAC was a publishing company incorporated in February 1905 for the express purpose of publishing the encyclopedia. The five members of the encyclopedia&#x27;s editorial board also served as the RAC directors. In 1912, the company changed its name was changed to The Encyclopedia Press. Publication of the encyclopedia&#x27;s volumes was the sole business conducted by Encyclopedia Press during the project&#x27;s lifetime.

==Purpose==

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; was designed to serve Catholics and other readers who wanted information about the church from the Catholic point of view. The encyclopedia records the accomplishments of Catholics and others in nearly all intellectual and professional pursuits, including the arts, education and science. While more limited in focus than other general encyclopedias, it was far broader in scope than previous efforts at comprehensive Catholic encyclopedias, which covered only internal Church affairs.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; offers in-depth portrayals of historical and philosophical ideas, persons and events, from a Catholic perspective, including issues that divide Catholicism from Protestantism and other faith communities. Since the encyclopedia was first published starting in 1907 and has never been updated (versus the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;), many of its entries may be out of date either with respect to the wider culture or to the Catholic ecclesiastical world. In particular, it predates the creation of the Vatican City State (1929) and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), which introduced changes to Catholic practice.

==History==
The writing of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; began in 1905, under the supervision of five editors:
* Charles G. Herbermann, professor of Latin and librarian of the College of the City of New York
* Reverend Edward A. Pace, professor of philosophy at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.
* Condé B. Pallen, editor and poet
* Reverend Thomas J. Shahan, professor of church history at the Catholic University
* Reverend John J. Wynne, S.J., editor of the &quot;Messenger of the Sacred Heart&quot; periodical

RAC published the first edition of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. It released the volumes sequentially, the first two in 1907 and the last three in 1912:
The five editors of the encyclopedia convened their first editorial meeting at the offices of the &quot;Messenger&quot; in Manhattan. In addition to frequent informal conferences and constant communication by letters, the editors held 134 formal meetings to consider the plan, scope and progress of the multi-volume reference work This review process may have been accelerated by the reuse of older authorized publications. The editors received a &quot;nihil obstat,&quot; a declaration of no objection, from Remy Lafort, an official church censor, on November 1, 1908. Archbishop John Farley of New York then gave the first volumes of the encyclopedia his imprimatur. 

Publication of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; began in 1907 with Volume 1 Aachen–Assize. It ended with Volume 15, Tournon–Zwirner, published in 1913. A first supplement was published nine years later in 1922; a second supplement in nine loose-leaf sections was published by The Gilmary Society three decades later, between 1950 and 1958.

In 1912, a special completely illustrated, commemorative volume was awarded to those patrons who contributed to the start of the enterprise in 1907 by buying multiple encyclopedia sets early on.

There was controversy over the presence of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; on the shelves in public libraries in the United States with nativist protests that this violated the constitutional separation of church and state, including a successful court appeal in Belleville, New Jersey.

The original &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; was updated during the 1960s by the faculty of the Catholic University. The university published the &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; in 1967, followed by several supplements over the next three decades. Catholic University published a revised second edition of the New Catholic Encyclopedia in 2002, followed by more supplements.

===Authors and sources===
&quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers&quot; states that:

The work is entirely new, and not merely a translation or a compilation from other encyclopedic sources. The editors have insisted that the articles should contain the latest and most accurate information to be obtained from the standard works on each subject.

However, &quot;from standard works&quot; allows that some of the articles from European contributors such as Pierre Batiffol (French) and Johann Peter Kirsch (German) had previously been published in whole or in part in Europe and were translated and edited for the Encyclopedia. Those who wrote new articles in English include Anthony Maas and Herbert Thurston.

==Online versions==
Under the copyright law of the United States, all works published in the United States before 1928 are considered in the public domain. In 1993, Kevin Knight, a 26-year-old resident of Denver, Colorado, decided, during the visit of Pope John Paul II (1920-2005, served 1978-2005), to that city for World Youth Day, to launch a project to republish the 1907-1913 original edition of the &#x27;&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; on the Internet. Knight founded the Web site New Advent to host the undertaking. Volunteers from several countries, including the United States, Canada, France, and Brazil helped in the transcription of the original text material. The site first went online two years later in 1995, and transcription work ended after four years efforts in 1997.

In 2007, Catholic Answers internet website published a watermarked version derived from page scans. This version has since been replaced with a transcription of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; similar to that found at the New Advent web site. The Catholic Answers transcription, however, is an exact transcription of the original text, whereas the New Advent version at times modernizes certain usages (e.g., using the titles of Old Testament books found in several Protestant versions of the Holy Bible (used in Protestant churches / denominations), such as &quot;1 &amp; 2 Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Obadiah&quot;, in place of the titles traditionally used differently in the Vulgate (Latin) / Douay–Rheims (Roman Catholic) Bible versions, (such as titles of &quot;1 &amp; 2 Paralipomenon&quot; and &quot;Abdias&quot;) and Biblical citation formatting (i.e., the Catholic Answers version retains the original&#x27;s usage of Roman numerals for chapter numbers [e.g., Genesis I,1], while the New Advent version uses Arabic numerals throughout [e.g., Genesis 1:1]).

Another transcription is hosted by Catholic Online internet website. Similarly to the Catholic Answers transcription, it uses an exact rendition of the original text.

Scanned copies of the 1907-1913 Encyclopedia are available on Google Books, at the Internet Archive, and at Wikimedia Commons. Wikisource also hosts a transcription project backed by the scans hosted at Commons.

The 1922 supplement to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; is also in the public domain and is available online. The &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1967, also is available online at some academic and public libraries.

<doc id="468291" wikidata="Q161946" url="?curid=468291" title="Dipsacus">
<text>Dipsacus is a genus of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae. The members of this genus are known as teasel, teazel or teazle. The genus includes about 15 species of tall herbaceous biennial plants (rarely short-lived perennial plants) growing to tall. &quot;Dipsacus&quot; species are native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa.

==Etymology==

The genus name (&quot;Dipsacus&quot;) is derived from the Greek word for thirst (&quot;dipsa&quot;) and refers to the cup-like formation made where sessile leaves merge at the stem.

The name &quot;teasel&quot; derives from words such as Old English &quot;tǣsl&quot;, &quot;tǣsel&quot;; relating to the verb &quot;to tease&quot; – the dried heads of the plant were once used in the textile industry to raise the nap on woolen cloth.

==Description==
Teasels are easily identified with their prickly stem and leaves, and the inflorescence of purple, dark pink, lavender or white flowers that form a head on the end of the stem(s). The inflorescence is ovoid, long and broad, with a basal whorl of spiny bracts. The first flowers begin opening in a belt around the middle of the spherical or oval flowerhead, and then open sequentially toward the top and bottom, forming two narrow belts as the flowering progresses. The dried head persists afterwards, with the small () seeds maturing in mid autumn. In rainy weather, some seeds may germinate when still in the seedhead (vivipary).

===Carnivory===
Carnivory in teasels was discussed by Francis Darwin (son of Charles Darwin) in a paper held by the Royal Society.

Rain water can collect in the cup-like receptacles that form where sessile leaves join the stem; this structure may perform the function of preventing sap-sucking insects such as aphids from climbing the stem. These in turn may also be used to collect the nutrients from any animal matter that accumulates within them, making them a form of protocarnivorous plant.

Contemporary attempts to replicate Darwin&#x27;s experiments on the common teasel continue to fuel debate over whether or not &quot;Dipsacus&quot; is truly carnivorous. A 2011 study revealed increased seed production (but not height) dependent on both amount and nature of introduced animal supplementation, while 2019 experiments suggested that the increased seed set was a response to poor soil conditions rather than proof of proto-carnivory. The leaf shape is lanceolate, long and broad, with a row of small spines on the underside of the midrib.

===As food===
The seeds are an important winter food resource for some birds, notably the European goldfinch. Teasels are often grown in gardens and encouraged on some nature reserves to attract them.

===As an invasive species===
Teasel is considered an invasive species in the United States. It is known to form a monoculture, capable of crowding out all native plant species, and therefore is discouraged or eliminated within restored open lands and other conservation areas. Two moths useful for biological control were tested in Slovakia in 2003–2004, including the monophagous &quot;Endothenia gentianaeana&quot;, but the USDA has not approved either of them for introduction as of February 2018. Instead, the USDA continues to suggest the use of herbicidal chemicals.

== Species ==
, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:

*&quot;Dipsacus asper&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus atratus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus atropurpureus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus azureus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus cephalarioides&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus chinensis&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus comosus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus ferox&quot; – spiny teasel
*&quot;Dipsacus fullonum&quot; – wild teasel, common teasel, fuller&#x27;s teasel
*&quot;Dipsacus gmelinii&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus inermis&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus japonicus&quot; – Japanese teasel, Chinese teasel
*&quot;Dipsacus laciniatus&quot; – cut-leaved teasel
*&quot;Dipsacus leschenaultii&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus narcisseanus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus pilosus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus pinnatifidus&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus&quot; × &quot;pseudosylvestris&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus sativus&quot; – fuller&#x27;s teasel (cultivated form)
*&quot;Dipsacus strigosus&quot; – slim teasel
*&quot;Dipsacus valsecchii&quot; 
*&quot;Dipsacus walkeri&quot; 


==Cultivation and uses==
Since Roman times, Fuller&#x27;s teasel (the cultivar group &quot;Dipsacus fullonum&quot; Sativus Group; syn. &quot;D. sativus&quot;) was widely used in textile processing, as it provides a natural comb for cleaning, aligning and raising the nap on fabrics, particularly wool (i.e. &#x27;fulling&#x27;). The product of the teasing process is called teased wool. The cultivar differs from the wild type in having stouter, somewhat recurved spines on the seed heads. The dried flower heads were attached to spindles, wheels, or cylinders, sometimes called teasel frames, to raise the nap on fabrics (that is, to tease the fibres). By the 20th century, teasels had been largely replaced by metal cards, which can be made uniformly and do not require constant replacement as the teasel heads wear. However, some people who weave wool still prefer to use teasels for raising the nap, claiming that the result is better; in particular, if a teasel meets serious resistance in the fabric, it will break, whereas a metal tool will rip the cloth.

Teasels are also occasionally grown as ornamental plants, and the dried heads are used in floristry.

Teasels have been naturalised in many regions away from their native range, partly due to the import of fuller&#x27;s teasel for textile processing, and partly by the seed being a contaminant mixed with crop seeds.

Common teasel (&quot;Dipsacus fullonum&quot;) and cut-leaved teasel (&quot;Dipsacus laciniatus&quot;) have both been observed as invasive species in the United States. Common is more widespread, but cut-leaved is more aggressive.

Due to the chemical dipsacus saponin C, &quot;Dipsacus asper&quot; has medically significant procoagulant properties, likely due to an increase of intracellular calcium, and apoptosis of mitochondria. This presents a considerable risk to the average user but may be beneficial in certain circumstances.

== Phytochemistry ==
Ethanol extracts of &quot;Dipsacus asper&quot; contain phenolic acids including caffeic acid, 2,6-dihydroxycinnamic acid, vanillic acid, 2′-O-caffeoyl-D-glucopyranoside ester, and caffeoylquinic acid, iridoid glucosides, triterpenoids oleanic acid and akebiasaponin D.

<text>Philadelphia is a 1993 American legal drama film directed and produced by Jonathan Demme, written by Ron Nyswaner, and starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Filmed on location in its namesake city, it tells the story of attorney Andrew Beckett (Hanks) who comes to ask a personal injury attorney, Joe Miller (Washington), to help him sue his former employer, who fired him after discovering he was gay and that he had AIDS. The cast also features Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen, Antonio Banderas, and Joanne Woodward.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; is notable for being one of the first mainstream Hollywood films not only to explicitly address HIV/AIDS and homophobia, but also to portray gay people in a positive light. It premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 1993 in a benefit for the AIDS Project, and opened in limited release on December 22, before expanding into wide release on January 14, 1994. It grossed $206.7 million worldwide, becoming the 9th highest-grossing film of 1993.

The film was positively received by critics for its screenplay and the performances of Hanks and Washington. For his performance as Andrew Beckett, Hanks won Best Actor at the 66th Academy Awards, while the song &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; by Bruce Springsteen won Best Original Song. Nyswaner was also nominated for the Best Original Screenplay, but lost to Jane Campion for &quot;The Piano.&quot;

==Plot==

Andrew Beckett is a senior associate at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. He conceals his homosexuality and his status as an AIDS patient from others in the office. A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett&#x27;s forehead. Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury, it indicates Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition.

Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. He finishes the paperwork for a case he has been assigned and brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file it the following day, which marks the end of the statute of limitations for the case. The next day, he receives a call asking for the paperwork, as it cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer&#x27;s hard drive. The paperwork is finally located in an alternative location and is filed with the court at the last moment. Beckett is called to a meeting the morning afterwards where the firm&#x27;s partners dismiss him.

Beckett believes someone deliberately hid the paperwork to give the firm an excuse to fire him and that the termination is a result of his AIDS status and his sexuality. He asks ten attorneys to take his case, the last of whom is African-American personal injury lawyer Joe Miller, whom Beckett previously opposed in a different case. Miller appears uncomfortable that a man with AIDS is in his office. After declining to take the case, Miller immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the disease. The doctor explains that the routes of HIV infection do not include casual contact.

Unable to find a lawyer willing to represent him, Beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney. While conducting research at a law library, Miller sees Beckett at a nearby table. A librarian approaches Beckett and says that he has found a case of AIDS discrimination for him. As others in the library begin to stare uneasily, the librarian suggests Beckett go to a private room. Seeing parallels in racial discrimination he has experienced, Miller approaches Beckett, reviews the material he has gathered, and agrees to take the case.

As the case goes to trial, the partners of the firm take the stand, each claiming that Beckett was incompetent and that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition. The defense repeatedly point out Beckett brought AIDS upon himself via willing gay sex with strangers and is therefore not a victim. It is revealed that the partner who noticed Beckett&#x27;s lesion, Walter Kenton, previously worked with a woman who contracted AIDS after a blood transfusion and thus he should have recognized the lesion as being a symptom of an AIDS-related illness. According to Kenton, the woman was an innocent victim, unlike Beckett, and he further testifies that he did not recognize Beckett&#x27;s lesion. To prove that the lesions would have been visible, Miller asks Beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions are indeed visible and recognizable as such. Throughout the trial, Miller&#x27;s homophobia slowly disappears as he and Beckett bond from working together.

Beckett collapses and is hospitalized after Charles Wheeler, the partner he most admired, testifies against him. Another partner, Bob Seidman, confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but never told anyone and refused to let him discuss it, which he deeply regrets. During Beckett&#x27;s hospital stay, the jury votes in his favor, awarding him back pay, damages for pain and suffering, and punitive damages, totaling over $5 million. Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett&#x27;s face. After the family leaves the room, Beckett tells his lover Miguel Alvarez that he is &quot;ready&quot;. At the Miller home later that night, Miller and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Miguel, who tells them that Beckett has died. A memorial is held at Beckett&#x27;s home, where many mourners, including Miller and his family, view home movies of Beckett as a happy child.

==Cast==
==Inspiration==
The events in the film are similar to the events in the lives of attorneys Geoffrey Bowers and Clarence Cain. Bowers was an attorney who, in 1987, sued the law firm Baker McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases. Cain was an attorney for Hyatt Legal Services who was fired after his employer found out he had AIDS. He sued Hyatt in 1990, and won just before his death.

In 1994, shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Scott Burr, a former attorney with the Philadelphia firm of Kohn, Nast and Graf, sued his previous employer for illegally terminating him upon finding out that he was HIV positive. Like the defendants in the film, the firm claimed that it fired him for incompetence without knowing about his health. The parties settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount after three weeks of trial. Burr continued to practice law prior to his death in 2020.

===Controversy===
Bowers&#x27;s family sued the writers and producers of the film. A year after Bowers&#x27;s death in 1987, a producer, Scott Rudin, had interviewed the Bowers family and their lawyers, and, according to the family, promised compensation for the use of Bowers&#x27;s story as a basis for a film. Family members asserted that 54 scenes in the movie were so similar to events in Bowers&#x27;s life that some of them could only have come from their interviews. However, the defense said that Rudin had abandoned the project after hiring a writer and did not share any information the family had provided. The lawsuit was settled after five days of testimony. Although terms of the agreement were not released, the defendants did admit that &quot;the film &#x27;was inspired in part&#x27;&quot; by Bowers&#x27; story.

== Production ==

===Casting===
Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the role of Andrew Beckett but turned it down, as he was already committed to &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;. Andy García was briefly attached. Matthew Modine and William Baldwin were both considered.

Bill Murray, William Hurt, Robin Williams, Nick Nolte, and Tim Robbins were considered for the role of Joe Miller.

John Leguizamo was offered the role of Miguel Álvarez, but turned it down to play Luigi in the film &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in June 2022, Tom Hanks said that the film would not get made nowadays with a straight actor in a gay role, stating audiences wouldn&#x27;t &quot;accept the inauthenticity of a straight guy playing a gay guy&quot;. Hanks added that that was &quot;rightly so&quot;, stating &quot;One of the reasons people weren&#x27;t afraid of that movie is that I was playing a gay man&quot;.

TriStar Pictures initially refused to insure actor Ron Vawter, who was openly HIV-positive at the time, insisting Jonathan Demme recast him. Demme refused, even changing the shooting schedule to accommodate Vawter after he was hospitalized for a month. Vawter died of complications from AIDS less than five months after the film&#x27;s premiere. The American Film Institute notes that of some 53 AIDS-positive actors who appeared in the film, 43 (including Vawter) died within a year of its release.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in-sequence (chronological order), as Hanks had to gradually lose weight over the course of the film, and to help the actor follow a clear emotional trajectory. Filming took place on-location in Philadelphia, with the courtroom scenes shot at City Hall. Other locations included the University of Pennsylvania library, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Spectrum arena.

==Release==
===Theatrical release===
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on December 14, 1993 and opened in limited release in four theaters on December 22, before expanding into wide release on January 14, 1994. The Los Angeles premiere was a benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles, which netted $250,000 APLA Chair Steve Tisch told the Los Angeles Times.

The film was the first Hollywood big-budget, big-star film to tackle the issue of AIDS in the United States (following the television film &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;) and signaled a shift in Hollywood films toward more realistic depictions of people in the LGBT community. According to a Tom Hanks interview for the 1995 documentary &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, he was cast in the role due to his non-intimidating screen persona in order to allow for audiences to sympathize with a gay, HIV-positive character. However, scenes showing more affection between him and Banderas were cut, including one with him and Banderas in bed together. The DVD edition, produced by Automat Pictures, includes this scene. According to Jonathan Demme, the scene was cut for pacing.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was released on VHS on June 29, 1994 and on DVD on September 10, 1997. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was later released as a limited edition Blu-ray through Twilight Time on May 14, 2013. In conjunction with the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the film was released on 4K Blu-Ray on November 27, 2018.

The screenplay was also republished in a novelization by writer Christopher Davis in 1994.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was originally released on December 22, 1993, in a limited opening of only four theaters, and had a weekend gross of $143,433 with an average of $35,858 per theater. The film expanded its release on January 14, 1994, to 1,245 theaters and went to number one at the US box office, grossing $13.8 million over the 4-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, averaging $11,098 per theater. The film stayed at number 1 the following weekend, earning another $8.8  million.

In its 14th weekend, the weekend after the Oscars, the film expanded to 888 theaters, and saw its gross increase by 70 percent, making $1.9  million and jumping from number 15 the previous weekend (when it made $1.1  million from 673 theaters), to return to the top ten ranking at number 8 that weekend.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; eventually grossed $77.4 million in North America and $129.2 million overseas for a total of $206.7 million worldwide against a budget of $26million, making it a significant box office success, and becoming the 12th highest-grossing film in the U.S. of 1993.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; holds an approval rating of 81% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Philadelphia&quot; indulges in some unfortunate clichés in its quest to impart a meaningful message, but its stellar cast and sensitive direction are more than enough to compensate.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In a contemporary review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars and said that it is &quot;quite a good film, on its own terms. And for moviegoers with an antipathy to AIDS but an enthusiasm for stars like Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, it may help to broaden understanding of the disease. It&#x27;s a ground-breaker like &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), the first major film about an interracial romance; it uses the chemistry of popular stars in a reliable genre to sidestep what looks like controversy.&quot;

Christopher Matthews from the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote &quot;Jonathan Demme&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;Philadelphia&quot; is so expertly acted, well-meaning and gutsy that you find yourself constantly pulling for it to be the definitive AIDS movie.&quot; James Berardinelli from ReelViews wrote &quot;The story is timely and powerful, and the performances of Hanks and Washington assure that the characters will not immediately vanish into obscurity.&quot; Rita Kempley from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;It&#x27;s less like a film by Demme than the best of Frank Capra. It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack album was released in January 1994, by Epic Soundtrax containing the main music featured in the film.

===Track listing===
The album was re-released in 2008 in France only as a CD/DVD combo pack with the film itself, containing the same track listing (catalogue number 88697 322052 under both Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Sony Classical labels). The director originally contacted Neil Young to record a rock anthem to open the film, but after viewing a cut of it, Young was inspired to write a slow and quiet ballad instead. Demme decided Young&#x27;s song would be more appropriate for the ending of the film, so he approached Bruce Springsteen to write an anthem. Springsteen viewed the opening montage, which at the time featured Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Southern Man&quot; as the temp track, but like Young he was inspired to create something quieter, in this case a beat-driven recording that became &quot;Streets of Philadelphia.&quot; However, Springsteen&#x27;s first contribution, &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; was rejected by Demme even though Springsteen knew it was not what Demme originally wanted, he sent it to him anyway. When Demme and his wife were moved by the recording, she advised him that it was likely the direction he should be going and he agreed.

<text>Gwadar (, ) is a port city on the southwestern coast of the Pakistani province of Balochistan. The city is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea, opposite Oman and has a population of over 90,000, according to the 2017 census. It was an overseas possession of Oman from 1783 to 1958. It is about southwest of Turbat. The sister port city of Chabahar in Iran&#x27;s Sistan and Baluchestan province is about to the west of Gwadar. On 2 April 2021, it was declared the winter capital of Balochistan.

The main industrial concern is a fish-processing factory. Gwadar became part of the sultanate of Muscat and Oman in 1797, and it was not until 1958 that the town and adjoining hinterland were exchanged from Oman to Pakistan.

Gwadar came in the focus of attention after the Kargil War when Pakistan felt the need of having a military naval port and the Karachi-Gwadar Road (Coastal Highway) was built for defence purposes. For most of its history, Gwadar was a small to medium-sized settlement with an economy largely based on artisanal fishing. The strategic value of its location was first recognized in 1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep-water port by the United States Geological Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still under Omani rule. Until 2001, the area&#x27;s potential to be a major deep-water port remained untapped under successive Pakistani governments, when construction on the first phase of Gwadar Port was initiated in 2007. The first phase cost $248 million. The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons, including lack of investment, security concerns, and the Government of Pakistan&#x27;s failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator, Port of Singapore Authority.

In April 2015, Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the $46 billion China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which in turn forms part of China&#x27;s ambitious One Belt, One Road. Gwadar features heavily in CPEC, and is also envisaged to be the link between the One Belt, One Road and Maritime Silk Road project. $1.153 billion worth of infrastructure projects will be invested into the city as part of CPEC, with the aim of linking northern Pakistan and western China to the deep-water seaport. The city will also be the site of a floating liquefied natural gas facility that will be built as part of the larger $2.5 billion Gwadar–Nawabshah segment of the Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline project. Despite concerns over the United States sanctions on Iran, Pakistan is going ahead constructing a pipeline from the Iranian border to Gwadar as of 2024. This is partly to avoid contractual penalties and partly to avoid over-reliance on the Gwadar Coal–Power Plant which requires imported coal. In addition to investments directly under the aegis of CPEC in the Gwadar city, the China Overseas Port Holding Company in June 2016 began construction on the $2 billion Gwadar Special Economic Zone, which is being modelled on the lines of the special economic zones of China. In September 2016, the Gwadar Development Authority published a request for tenders for the preparation of expropriation and resettlement of Old Town Gwadar.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Gwadar&quot; is a combination of two Balochi words – &quot;guad&quot; meaning &quot;wind&quot; and &quot;dar&quot; meaning &quot;gateway&quot; or &quot;door&quot; (), thus Gwadar means &quot;the gate of wind&quot;.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===
The inhabitation of Gwadar, like most of the other areas of Balochistan, appears to be ancient. The area shows inhabitation as early as the Bronze Age with settlements around some of the area&#x27;s oasis. It is from this settlement pattern that the word Makran, the original name of Balochistan, is derived. For a period, it was a region of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. It is believed to have been conquered by the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great. The capital of the &quot;satrapy&quot; of Gedrosia was Pura, which is thought to have been located near the modern Bampūr, in Iranian Balochistan. During the homeward march of Alexander the Great, his admiral, Nearchus, led a fleet along the modern-day Makran coast and recorded that the area was dry, mountainous, and inhabited by the &quot;Ichthyophagoi&quot; (or &quot;fish-eaters&quot;), an ancient Greek rendering of the ancient Persian phrase &quot;&quot;Mahi Khorana&quot;,&quot; which has itself become the modern word &quot;Makran&quot;. After the collapse of Alexander&#x27;s empire the area was ruled by Seleucus Nicator, one of Alexander&#x27;s generals. The region then came under Mauryan rule around 303 BCE, after Seleucus made peace with Emperor Chandragupta and ceded the territory to the Mauryans.

=== Omani rule ===

The region remained on the sidelines of history for a millennium until the Arab-Muslim army captured Makran in CE 643 and over the intervening (and nearly equivalent) amount of time the area was contested by various powers. This was then followed by almost two centuries of local rule by the various Baloch tribes. The city was visited by Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis in the 1550s and mentioned in his book &quot;Mirat ul Memalik&quot; (The Mirror of Countries), 1557. According to Seydi Ali Reis, the inhabitants of Gwadar were Baloch and their chief was Malik Jelaleddin, son of Malik Dinar.

In the 15th century the Portuguese conquered parts of India and Oman. They planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of Makran. They attacked Gwadar under the leadership of Vasco de Gama, but under the supervision of Commander Mir Ismaheel Baloch, the Portuguese were defeated by the Baloch. A few times the Portuguese looted and set the coastal villages on fire, but they failed to capture Gwadar. Cannons of the Portuguese army were found lying near the Central Jail of Gwadar. The grave of Mir Ismaheel Baloch is situated near the Mountain of Batal Gwadar, constructed by Mir Ismaheel Baloch himself during life. He died in 1468, heirless.
By the end of the 16th century, Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great conquered the city along with all of Balochistan after the Battle of Sehwan. It remained under Mughal control until early 18th century.

Towards the end of the 18th century, the Khan of Kalat, Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch, granted suzerainty over Gwadar to Sultan bin Ahmad, the ruler of Muscat. When the sultan subsequently retook Muscat, he was to continue his rule in Gwadar by appointing a &quot;wali&quot; (or &quot;governor&quot;). This &quot;wali&quot; was then ordered to subjugate the nearby coastal town of Chabahar (now in Iran). The Gwadar fort was built during Omani rule. In the middle of the 18th century, Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch captured Gwadar and its surrounding areas after defeating the Gichki Baloch tribe and included it in the Kalat Khanate. However, realizing that maintaining control of the area will be difficult without the support of the Gichkis, Mir Nasir entered into an agreement with the local Gichki Chief, which allowed the Gichkis to maintain administrative control of the area, in return for furnishing half the collected revenues to Kalat, this arrangement continued till 1783. When Saiad Sultan fell out with his brother, the ruler of Muscat, and asked for help, Mir Noori Naseer Khan handed over Gwadar, as part of his share of revenues, to Saiad Sultan for his maintenance with the understanding that the area be returned to Kalat, when Saiad Sultan acquires the throne. Saiad Sultan ascended to the throne of Muscat in 1797 but never returned Gwadar enclave to Kalat. The ensuing struggle between the heirs of the Sultan and Khan of Kalat for possession of Gwadar, allowed the British to intervene. Telegraph lines were later extended into the town courtesy of the British. The main two Wali of Gwadar were Saif Bin Ali (First) and Eshan Azim (Last) from 1783-1958.

The British after extracting concessions from the Sultan for the use of the area facilitated Muscat retaining Gwadar. Later on, the British claimed that the area was granted to the Sultan by Mir Nasir, however, local accounts and the declassified documents of that time challenge this claim. From 1863 to 1879, Gwadar was the headquarters of a British Assistant Political Agent. Gwadar was a fortnightly port of call for the British India Steamship Navigation Company&#x27;s steamers and included a combined Post &amp; Telegraph Office.

=== Pakistan ===
In 1947, Makran acceded to the newly created Dominion of Pakistan and was made a district – but Gwadar at that time was not included in Makran. In 1958, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Feroz Khan Noon and his wife Viqar-un-Nisa Noon were able to convince the British Government to hand over Gwadar to Pakistan. On September 8, 1958, Oman finally handed over Gwadar to Pakistan after Prince Karim Aga Khan IV made a contribution of around $3 million USD. It was given the status of a Tehsil of Makran district. On 1 July, 1977, Makran District was upgraded into a division and was divided into three districts of Turbat (Kech since 1994–95), Panjgur and Gwadar.

Gwadar underwent major development from 2002 to 2007. In 2002, Pakistan&#x27;s National Highway Authority (NHA) began construction of the 653 km-long Makran Coastal Highway linking Gwadar with Karachi via Pasni and Ormara and onwards with the rest of the National Highways of Pakistan, which was completed in 2004. In 2003, the Gwadar Development Authority was established to oversee the planning and development of Gwadar and Gwadar Industrial Estate Development Authority was established to promote industrial activities in mega port city of Gwadar. In 2004, NHA began construction of the 820-km long M-8 motorway linking Gwadar with Ratodero in Sindh province via Turbat, Hoshab, Awaran, and Khuzdar and onwards with the rest of the Motorways of Pakistan. In 2006, the Gwadar Development Authority conceived, developed, and adopted a 50-year Master Plan for Gwadar, which was inspired by the Chinese port city of Shenzhen. In 2007, the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan acquired to construct a new greenfield airport, the New Gwadar International Airport , at an estimated cost of US$246 million. It is expected to be operational by 2025.

On 3 June 2022, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif inaugurated the 19.49 km, six-lane Gwadar East Bay Expressway, which was developed as an early harvest project under the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. The expressway connects the Gwadar Port with the Makran Coastal Highway, thus improving connectivity and helping the transportation of goods towards Karachi. Other developments include 100MW Electricity import from Iran, multiple Housing Schemes, 5-star Hotels, Expo Centre, Desalination Plants on Arabian Sea, Pak-China Friendship Hospital, Aramco Oil Refinery (foreign investment from Saudi Arabia) and an ICC Standard Cricket Stadium.

=== 2024 Baloch Raji Muchi ===
In July and August 2024, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) organized the Baloch Raji Muchi (&quot;Baloch National Gathering&quot;) in Gwadar to advocate for rights of the Baloch people. On 27 July, the Frontier Corps, a Pakistani paramilitary force, fired on participants traveling to Gwadar, injuring at least 14. The next day, security forces killed at least three protesters in Gwadar and Talar and injured dozens more. On 29 July, the police used tear gas to disperse crowds, detaining key BYC organizers including Sammi Deen Baloch, Sabghatullah Shah, and Dr. Sabiha Baloch, drawing international condemnation from organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===


Gwadar is situated on the southwestern Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan in Gwadar District of Balochistan province. Like Ormara further east, Gwadar is situated on a natural hammerhead-shaped tombolo peninsula forming two almost perfect, but naturally curved, semicircular bays on either side. The city is situated on a narrow and sandy isthmus which connects the Pakistani coast to rocky outcroppings in the Arabian sea known as the Gwadar Promontory, or &quot;Koh-e-Batil,&quot; which reach an elevation of and extend east to west with a breadth of . The wide isthmus upon which Gwadar is located separates the two almost perfect semicircular bays from one another. The western bay is known as the &quot;Paddi Zirr,&quot; and is generally shallow with an average depth of , and a maximum depth of . To the east of the isthmus is the deepwater &quot;Demi Zirr&quot; harbour, where the Gwadar Port was built.

=== Climate ===
Gwadar has a hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Oceanic influence from the cool currents of the Arabian Sea moderates temperatures, resulting in notably cooler summer temperatures compared to areas inland and cities in the Persian Gulf such as Dubai. The Arabian Sea also moderates winter temperatures, resulting in warmer winter nights as compared to inland areas.

The mean temperature in the hottest month (June) remains between 31 °C and 32 °C. The mean temperature in the coolest month (January) varies from 18 °C to 19 °C. The uniformity of temperature is a unique characteristic of the Makran Coastal region. Occasionally, winds moving down the Balochistan plateau bring brief cold spells, otherwise the winter is pleasant. In Gwadar, winters are shorter than summers. Although Gwadar is situated outside the monsoon belt, it receives light monsoon showers in summer (June–August). However, in winter, Western Disturbance can cause heavy rainfall. Annual rainfall is only 100 mm (3 inches). In June 2010, Gwadar was lashed by Cyclone Phet with record-breaking rains of 372 mm and winds up to .

On 27-28 February 2024, Gwadar received a rainfall of 180 millimeters over 30 hours resulting in the flooding of the coastal town. Pakistan&#x27;s uniformed forces and local authorities evacuated families from sub-merged localities. The floodings blocked all traffic between Gwadar and Karachi due to the damaged coastal highway that connects both the cities.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
As Gwadar was part of Sultanate of Oman during the British rule, it was excluded from all the censuses of British India. According to the records of Oman from 1945, the Gwadar city had a population of 5,875. The population of the city has risen to approximately 85,000 as of 2014. In the 2017 census, Gwadar city had a total population of 90,762. 

The population of city in 2023 was 70,852 according to the 2023 Census of Pakistan. The population of Gwadar tehsil was 147,041 (2023).
=== Languages ===
The population of Gwadar is predominantly Baloch. 97.5% of the population in Gwadar tehsil speak the Baloch language as the mother tongue. Other spoken languages are Sindhi (0.7%), Brahui (0.6%), Urdu (0.2%), Saraiki (0.2%) and Pashto (0.2%).

== Administration ==
Gwadar serves as the headquarters for both the Gwadar District and Gwadar Tehsil. Gwadar Tehsil is administratively subdivided into five union councils.

On 2 April 2021, Gwadar was granted the title of capital of South Balochistan by the Balochistan government.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Gwadar is divided into 5 union councils, which are further subdivided into wards:
* Gwadar Central
** Gazrawan
** Komagri
** Mohallah Zahoor Shah
** Saleh Muhammad
** Sohrabi
** Usmania
* South Gwadar
** Kamari
** Mohallah Karim Bakhsh
** Mohallah Shahdu Band
** Mullah Band
** Murad Bakhsh
** Sarabi
** Sheikh Umar
** Tobagh
* North Gwadar
** Lal Baksh
** Mohalla Baloch
** Mohalla Mir Abdul Ghafoor
** Mujahid
* Pishukan
* Surbandar

== Culture ==

Gwadar&#x27;s location and history have given it a unique blend of cultures. The Arabic influence upon Gwadar is strong as a consequence of the Omani era and its close proximity to the Arabian peninsula. Remnants of Oman era buildings can also be found in the city.

== Strategic importance ==
Central Asia and South Asia, encompassing the Caspian region, Central Asian republics, Afghanistan and Iran, and the energy-rich &#x27;lake&#x27; called the Caspian Sea, is a significant region because of its huge monetary prospective and geographically vital positioning, which has formed the region as a centre piece in the international arena. Iran has also declared support for the development of Gwadar and its port.

== Economy ==

=== Gwadar Free Zone ===
The construction on a $20 billion 10-square kilometre tax exempt industrial zone began on 20 June 2016. The zone includes a 300MW coal powerplant exclusive for the industrial zone. Despite Chinese investment, much of this development, including the power plant, remains unfinished.

=== Gwadar Port ===

The Chinese share of revenue generated from Gwadar Port would be 91% while Pakistan will get 9% share. China has a great strategic interest in Gwadar. In 2013, the state-owned China Overseas Port Holdings Limited acquired Gwadar Port. The port is strategically important for China as sixty percent of China&#x27;s oil comes from the Persian Gulf by ships traveling over in two to three months, confronting pirates, bad weather, political rivals, and other risks up to its only commercial port, Shanghai. Gwadar will reduce the distance to a mere and also operate year-round.

China is heavily dependent on Persian Gulf oil which passes through the Strait of Malacca all the way through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Once the oil reaches China&#x27;s east coast ports, it is transported thousands of kilometres inland to western China. The Gwadar Port–Karakoram Highway (KKH) route is sometimes said to be safer, cheaper and shorter than transporting the oil by ocean tanker. However, research suggests that transporting oil by roadways from Gwadar to China would be very expensive, would encounter numerous logistical difficulties such as mountainous terrain, earthquakes, disputes with India, and potential terrorist attacks, and would barely make any impact on China&#x27;s overall energy security, though Pakistan intends to build an oil pipeline to northern Pakistan that may allay much of these concerns.

Chinese goods flowing in the opposite direction may be able to find an easier, shorter and secure route to the Middle East. The city is also being developed as an export processing zone for foreign companies to manufacture in Gwadar before exporting to various countries in the region.

=== Reko Diq Transport ===

As of 2024 the government of Pakistan is constructing a highway between the port of Gwadar and Reko Diq Mine in Northwest Baluchistan. This will allow for the transportation of mining supplies and to the mine and concentrate by truck There are also plans for a slurry line and a railroad.

===New Gwadar International Airport===

Due to the Chinese interest in the Gwadar Port, Pakistan believes that Gwadar will become a regional hub. Prime Minister Imran Khan laid down the foundation stone for the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIAP) at Gwadar on 29 March 2019. New Gwadar International Airport is located in Gurandani, and is around northeast of Gwadar City proper, Balochistan Province. It is expected to cost $246 million and, with an area of , will be able to handle larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The new airport will cater to domestic and international flights, and will have an open skies policy.

It will be a greenfield airport, with a cargo terminal handling capacity of 30,000 tonnes a year. The single runway will measure in length with a width of , to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft; if needed in the near future, there is the likely potential for a second runway to be constructed. The CAA Pakistan has awarded the design and construction contract to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), and the facilities are expected to be operational by September of 2023.

== Twin towns and sister cities ==

Gwadar
* Padang, Indonesia.

==Education==
Literacy rate in Gwadar is estimated to be 25% in 2015. According to Pakistan District Education Rankings, a report by Alif Ailaan, district Gwadar is ranked nationally at 61, with an education score of 59.47 and learning score of 62.65. Enrollment levels are low in Gwadar because of fewer schools in the district. And the level of enrollment declines as the classes move up.

The literacy rate stood at 51.5 % in the 2023 census.

The school infrastructure score of Gwadar is 29.91, giving it a national rank of 122. 33% of all the schools in the district cater to girls as compared to 67% schools for boys, putting girls at a greater disadvantage. Lack of science labs and subject specialists teachers are also a major concern.

Overcrowding, teachers teaching two classes at the same time, lack of science teachers and lack of playing grounds are the issues faced by the residents of Gwadar.

<text>Denez Prigent (; born 17 February 1966 in Santec, Finistère) is a Breton folk singer-songwriter of the &quot;gwerz&quot; and &quot;kan ha diskan&quot; styles of Breton music. From his debut at the age of 16, he was known for singing traditional songs &quot;a cappella&quot;, and has moved on to singing his own songs with techno music accompaniments. He has performed in France as well as internationally and has recorded seven studio and two live albums.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and early career ===
During his childhood, Prigent lived with his father in Le Relecq-Kerhuon and spent his weekends at his grandmother&#x27;s, in Santec.
His father, a primary teacher, raised him speaking French, although he spoke Breton fluently, because he did not see the point in teaching Breton to his son. Denez thus discovered the Breton language at his grandmother&#x27;s, along with its natural harmony and the tendency of Breton speakers of that time to sing written or improvised songs.
While in secondary in Brest he preferred listening to Breton songs on his portable audio player than concentrating on his studies.

At age 14, Prigent was taught kan ha diskan by Alain Leclère, himself a former student of Manuel Kerjean, whose other students include Erik Marchand.
Two years later, in 1982, he sang with Alain Leclère in festoù-noz. In the Kan ar Bobl, he won the first prize in kan ha diskan in 1987, the first prize in new singing in 1988 and the first prize in traditional singing in 1990.

In 1988, driven by his passion for the Breton language, he became a Breton teacher in Carhaix, during which he was regularly invited in traditional music festivals such as the &quot;&quot; (Nightfalls) and the Festival Interceltique de Lorient.
In 1991, the city of Rennes invited him to participate in the &quot;Voice of Asia&quot; festival due to take place in its newly twinned city of Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. Surprised by this invitation, Prigent wrote a satirical song, &quot;Son Alma Ata&quot; (later included on &quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot;) about the incongruity for a Breton singer to be sent to perform in Kazakhstan. This first concert abroad gave him an opportunity to discover the Kazakh people, then integrated into the Soviet Union, and compare its situation to that of the Breton people, integrated into France.

In 1991, Prigent resigned from his teaching position in order to pursue his artistic career.
While collecting the lyrics of traditional songs, he met Eugénie Ebrel born Goadec, one of the three Goadec Sisters who revived Breton a cappella singing in the 1960s. She provided him with the lyrics of &quot;Ti Eliz Iza&quot;, and her daughter, Annie Ebrel, decided to join him on stage.

In 1992, Prigent sang a cappella during the Transmusicales, in front of an audience unused to this style. He subsequently left the band Daouarn with which he had sung in festoù-noz. He performed in the Montreux Jazz Festival, the Francofolies, the Midem, the Printemps de Bourges, the Coup de Cœur francophone in Quebec, the Mitte Europa festival, the &quot;Celtic Connection&quot; festival in Scotland, Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbonne, and the Eisteddfod festival in Wales.

=== &quot;Ar gouriz koar&quot; (1993) ===

In 1993, Prigent released his first album &quot;Ar gouriz koar&quot; (translated &quot;The Wax Belt&quot;) on Auvidis/Silex. Although the album was, at first, intended for promoting Prigent&#x27;s songs to festival organizers rather than for being sold to the general audience, its sales approached copies. Most of the songs are traditional Breton folk songs sung a cappella. However, former Storlok members Denez Abernot and Bernez Tangi wrote &quot;Plac&#x27;h Landelo&quot; and &quot;Gwerz ar vezhinerien&quot;, respectively, while Prigent himself wrote &quot;Gwerz an aksidan&quot;. Like all of his subsequent recordings, &quot;Ar gouriz koar&quot; is sung in the kan ha diskan and gwerz styles.

When Prigent failed to receive compensation from Auvidis/Silex for sales of the album, he sued the label and signed with Barclay Records for his subsequent releases. Further sales of &quot;Ar gouriz koar&quot; were blocked but Auvidis kept the original records, and in 1996 Prigent released a new recording of &quot;Ar gouriz koar&quot; with Barclay. For this and all subsequent recordings, Prigent uses the Peurunvan unified Breton orthography.

=== Introduction to electronic music and &quot;Me &#x27;zalcʼh ennon ur fulenn aour&quot; (1993–1999) ===
At his wife&#x27;s request, Prigent attended the first rave party held in Rennes, in 1993, in spite of his negative prejudice. There, he discovered a music that, like Breton music, is primarily meant to support dancing. Noticing that electronic music and Breton music are based on similar rhythms and notes closed to one another, he contemplated using it to accompany his songs.

In 1995, Prigent appeared in &quot;Dao Dezi&quot;.
The goal of this project of Éric Mouquet, a member of Deep Forest, and Guilain Joncheray is to treat Breton music in the same way that Deep Forest treated African music, with traditional lyrics and electronic accompaniments. Michel Sanchez, the other member of Deep Forest, also worked on the album, recorded and mixed by Erwin Autrique. Breton singers Arnaud Maisonneuve and Manu Lann Huel also appear on the album, as well as Tri Yann. It is Prigent&#x27;s first experience combining Breton lyrics and electronic music.

Prigent released his second album, &quot;Me &#x27;zalc&#x27;h ennon ur fulenn aour&quot; (I keep in myself a golden spark), in 1997. He wrote all the lyrics except for the traditional song &quot;Ar rannoù&quot; that appears in the Barzaz Breiz, and most of the musics, using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds. The subjects of the lyrics are the classical topics of gwerz : injustice, disease, death. &quot;E trouz ar gêr&quot;, about the artificial aspects of living in a city, and &quot;An hentoù adkavet&quot;, about the revival of the Tro Breizh, are his first songs devoted to Brittany, its culture and its relation to nature.

To select electronic samples, Prigent contacted Arnaud Rebotini, who granted him access to his collection of discs.
Prigent mostly chose jungle sounds, finding that their rhythm, at around 160–170 bpm, was well adapted to Breton singing.
In most cases, Prigent&#x27;s voice was recorded first and electronic sounds were added afterwards. This combination of ancient singing and modern music is illustrated by &quot;Ar rannoù&quot;, one of the oldest known Breton texts, for which Prigent recomposed the traditional tune using electronic sounds. He compared this treatment of singing and music to that of Alan Stivell:
Although the extreme difference between his a cappella songs and his new tracks using electronic samples received mixed reviews, Prigent considered that he remained faithful to the arrhythmic, unmeasured aspect of Breton music.
Particularly in gwerz, the singer must ensure that the intensity of the event being recounted comes first, and for this purpose, not sing in rhythm, but rather make pauses when appropriate. According to Prigent, a measured gwerz loses the identity of Breton singing, while an electronic accompaniment faithful to the arrhythmic song is perfectly natural.
Similarly, he attaches a great importance to the traditional pronunciation of Breton, including the &quot;dibril&quot;, an alveolar trill used in sung Breton only.
It is also essential for him to remain faithful to the writing rules of gwerz, with very long lyrics of which only a part is recorded, and its eternal topics that prevent this genre dating back to the 5th century from going out of fashion.
Fidelity to tradition is absolutely not a way of imprisoning himself in his own culture; on the contrary, for Prigent, developing the Breton culture by adapting it to modern technology is a way of opening up to other cultures.

With this album, Prigent also affirms his writing style. His verses are mostly octosyllables with, generally, a median caesura. This type of verse is very frequent in Breton, since short words are common, and thus long verses unneeded. He only writes in Breton, a language that, according to Prigent, kept its sacred aspect, contrarily to French. As a consequence, some lyrics remain untranslatable, even for their bilingual author.

In 1998, he took part in Alan Simon&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur, la légende des Celtes&quot;, with Roger Hodgson (the singer of Supertramp), Angelo Branduardi and Didier Lockwood.

=== &quot;Irvi&quot; (2000–2002) ===
In 2000, Denez Prigent released his third album, &quot;Irvi&quot;. This title is the plural of the word &quot;&quot;, i.e. a &quot;foam path&quot;, meaning a path, only usable at low tide, that links a tidal island to the continent or to another island. The song &quot;Hent-eon&quot; (foam path) describes the wish of a man from Lesconil to be buried in such a path so that he will be watched over by nature. This idea of a link between two worlds, between life and death, also appears in &quot;Daouzek huñvre&quot;, where seven lost spirits clothed in flesh walk in line on a foam path.

Like in &quot;Me &#x27;zalc&#x27;h ennon ur fulenn aour&quot;, Denez Prigent wrote all the lyrics, except those of the traditional song &quot;E ti Eliz Iza&quot;, on the bonus CD, and most of the musics, again using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds.
The latter are more discreet than on the previous album; &quot;Irvi&quot; thus sounds less &quot;jungle&quot; and more new age. The main invited musicians are the jazzman Louis Sclavis, the viellist Valentin Clastrier, and the uilleann piper Davy Spillane.

For the first time, French lyrics appear on one of Prigent&#x27;s albums. They are told by Bertrand Cantat on &quot;Daouzek huñvre&quot;, whose structure is reminiscent of the twelve series of &quot;Ar rannoù&quot;. The other voice that can be heard on this album is that of Lisa Gerrard, the singer of Dead Can Dance, on &quot;Gortoz a ran&quot; (I await). This song, the first one in the album, is part of the soundtrack of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, a film directed by Ridley Scott. &quot;Gortoz a ran&quot; has garnered recent attention (2016) after being featured in the American adult animated sitcom South Park during the second episode of season 20: &#x27;Skank Hunt.&#x27;

Another guest, the Bagad Kemper, performs with Denez Prigent on &quot;E trouz ar gêr&quot; and &quot;Ar sonerien du&quot;, a gwerz about the legend of the dark sonneurs, a couple of sonneurs (biniou and bombard) which the gendarmes arrested, mistaking them for thieves for whom they were looking.
Both were hanged and buried in Pont-l&#x27;Abbé before their innocence was established. Their graves are, to this day, a location of pilgrimage.
In Denez Prigent&#x27;s version of the legend, the gendarmes kill and hang the musicians in order not to admit to having let the real thieves escape, also insisting on the reputation of debauchery which the conformists gave, at the time, to festive music.

This album was nominated for the Victoires de la Musique in 2001.

After a series of concerts, Prigent recorded a live album, &quot;Live Holl a-gevret !&quot;, during the Festival interceltique de Lorient in August 2001, guest-starring the bagad Roñsed-Mor of Locoal-Mendon.

=== &quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot; (2003) ===
The next album, &quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot; (rustle), was released in 2003. Lisa Gerrard is again invited, as is Yanka Rupkina, the soloist of the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir, Karen Matheson of Capercaillie, and the Sami singer Mari Boine. Also appearing are the Dónal Lunny on the bouzouki, Nabil Khalidi on the oud, and Farhad Bouallagi on the violin. Although this album uses electronic sounds, the music is mostly performed on traditional instruments.

The album begins with two traditional songs : &quot;An hini a garan&quot;, with Lisa Gerrard, and &quot;E garnison !&quot;, with Louise Ebrel, who had already toured with Prigent.
Two previously unreleased songs written in the beginning of Prigent&#x27;s career are part of the album, &quot;Son Alma Ata&quot; and &quot;Ar gwez-sapin&quot;.

Contrarily to the previous albums, &quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot; contains very personal lyrics, in which the author writes about himself. &quot;N&#x27;eus forzh…&quot; is about the importance of singing, thanks to which Prigent never loses hope (&quot;&quot; : my fire always burns). He also resumes a verse already used in E trouz ar gêr sums up his way of life: &quot;n&#x27;eus ket un deiz na ganfen ket&quot; (there is not a single day during which I would not sing). In &quot;Dispi&quot;, he expresses his very pessimistic point of view on the Breton language, an essential topic for Prigent, who only sings in Breton and taught this language. He describes his despair about this situation, writing that those who dreamt of a return to harmony between generations linked by the Breton language and culture were crazy.

The eponymous song alone sums up Prigent&#x27;s main convictions. It relates his own return to nature, when, used to the never-ending noise of the cars on the highway next to which he lived in Rennes, he decided to buy a house in Lanvellec (Côtes d&#x27;Armor).
He then rediscovered the silence of nature, with the rustle of the wind in the trees in the background. He drew from that the impression, from which he writes the song, that modernisation cuts people from nature and encourages them to stay alone behind their screens.
&quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot; received the best album award of the Breton newspaper, &quot;Le Télégramme de Brest&quot;. Gilles Servat, who gave him the award, expressed his admiration for Denez Prigent, who he described as &quot;an artist emblematic of the renewal in Breton expression and in the search for new musicalities&quot;.

Since then, Prigent sang on such stages as the big stage of the Vieilles Charrues Festival, Rencontres Trans Musicales in Beijing, the Paléo Festival Nyon (Switzerland), the Rozrywki Theater in Poland, the Stimmen Festival (Germany), the antique Roman Theater in Vienna and the theater of Tenerife (Canary Islands). In Paris, he performed at the Stade de France for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, in Bercy Arena, the Bataclan, the Casino de Paris and the Théâtre de la Ville with guest singers Mari Boine and Karen Matheson as well as Donald Shaw.

=== &quot;An enchanting garden&quot; (2012–present) ===
In summer 2010, he announced to write for a next album. A Best-of album is published in 2011 (Barclay Records). In July, 2011, the Het Lindeboom festival gives to him a blank in front of an audience of 25,000: it has the occasion for him to invite the Hungarian singer Szilvia Bognar, one of the great voices of the Eastern countries, as well as the famous Welsh choir Flint Male Voice Choir.

In 2012, he presented a new show, &quot;Beajet &#x27;m eus&quot; (&quot; I travelled &quot;). On 7 April 2015, Denez published a new studio album, &quot;An enchanting garden - Ul liorzh vurzhudus&quot;. This album, comprising 12 original songs written by the singer, including one in English, is the result of several years of writing (a hundred gwerzioù of 80 verses), trips and experiments on stage. The Breton and Celtic themes, unstructured, are interwoven with Slavonic and Armenian (&quot;An tri seblant&quot;), Greek (&quot;Krediñ &#x27;raen&quot;), Andalusian (&quot;Ar binioù skornet&quot;), Bossa nova (&quot;An tri amourouz&quot;), Gypsy or Yiddish (&quot;Beajet&#x27;m eus&quot;), African (&quot;An trucher hag an Ankoù&quot;) for an entirely acoustic music. In songs in Breton, the artist invites to discover the corners of his inner garden and the plurality of his influences. Denez&#x27;s vocal, &quot;enigmatic and inspiring&quot; (accompanied by the hang on &quot;Before dawn&quot;), is like a link between the real and the invisible, supported by the writing of timeless stories, sometimes tragic, satirical or burlesque, such as &quot;Peñse Nedeleg&quot;, a Fisel dance describing the shipwreck of a freighter that makes the happiness of the inhabitants for Christmas or &quot;An tri amourouz&quot; whose black humor recalls that of Tim Burton. &quot;An Old Story&quot;, in English, couples with &quot;Gwechall gozh&quot;, in breton, two complaints sharing the same story: an innocent woman burnt like witch for having too many companions.
In November 2015, beatmaker James Digger remixed 4 tracks for an EP. It appealed to rapper Masta Ace, emblematic figure of Hip Hop, one of the references of Eminem. In exchange, Denez participated in May 2016 to his album &quot;The Falling Season&quot;, under &quot;Story of Me&quot;. His song &quot;Gortoz a Ran&quot; is used for two minutes in the episode &quot;Skank Hunt&quot; of the animated series &quot;South Park&quot; which first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on 21 September 2016.

In November 2016, the live album &quot;A-unvan gant ar stered - In unison with the stars&quot; released, recorded during the tour 2015–2016. On 19 November, after 20 years of absence on fest noz stages, the singer animated the Yaouank Festival in Rennes.

== Lyrical influences ==

=== Brittany and nature ===
To Denez Prigent, preserving nature in Brittany is as important as preserving traditions.
In &quot;An hentoù adkavet&quot;, he pays tribute to those who walk around Brittany, singing. At the same time, he regrets the fact that roads, nowadays, are mostly used by cars, leaving little space to walk.
Similarly, in &quot;Ar gwez-sapin&quot;, a song about land consolidation, he criticises the replacement of deciduous trees, traditionally seen in Brittany, with conifers, because of which landscapes lose their specificity, and draws the same link again: &quot;He who is made to forget his culture forgets one day his nature&quot;.

The sadness that Denez Prigent feels when he lives in a city is the topic of &quot;E trouz ar gêr&quot;, which concludes as the world ends, and in &quot;Melezourioù-glav&quot;, in which he finds a new hope in the last remaining natural element: rain.
Since he cannot find nature around him, Prigent keeps it in his memory (&quot;Kereñvor&quot;).
He ends up going back to living in the country, as told in &quot;Sarac&#x27;h&quot;.

&quot;Hent-eon&quot; is also about harmony with nature, this time in death. The narrator wishes to be buried in a foam path to be eternally cradled by the tide, watched over by his real family: rain, birds, wind, the sea.

A variation on this conviction is found in &quot;Geotenn ar marv&quot;, a song against the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture. To him, there is no meaning in singing in Breton on a land that has lost its nature due to this &quot;herb of death&quot; sown by &quot;those who shamelessly changed that which could not be changed&quot;.

=== Injustice, disease, death ===

In the tradition of gwerz, Denez Prigent writes about dramatic events about which he hears during a travel, a conversation, or through medias.
The subject of &quot;An droug-red&quot; is the Ebola epidemic in Zaire.
The main character, seeing everyone dying around him, kills an old woman, allegory of the disease.
&quot;Copsa Mica&quot; is about the Sometra factory, representing the metallurgic industry in Copşa Mică, Romania.
Producing large amounts of pollutants, this factory was one of the few employers of the city. As a result, young people had, for a living, to operate the blast furnace that killed them slowly.
&quot;Gwerz Kiev&quot; relates the Holodomor, the famine that struck Ukraine in the 1930s, with casualties estimated to four million.

&quot;Ur fulenn aour&quot; is the lament of a young girl sold by her parents to become a prostitute in the Philippines.
A variation on this topic is forced marriage, of which the narrator of &quot;A-dreñv va zi&quot; is a victim.
Given before her thirteenth birthday to a man who makes her a slave, she sheds her tears on the tree she planted, which bears the best fruit in the world. She hanged her husband, her mother-in-law and her parents on that tree.

Denez Prigent also covers some better-known topics in international politics. &quot;An iliz ruz&quot; is a very graphical description of the massacre of people in a church in Nyarubuyé, Rwanda: &quot;they cut their heads off mercilessly / like one reaps wheat in summer&quot;.
&quot;Ar chas ruz&quot; relates the invasion of Tibet by China, where the &quot;red dogs&quot; kill not only men, but also their culture.

Two songs are devoted to infanticide. &quot;Ar wezenn-dar&quot; is more specifically about the case of India, where the policy of population decrease favoured the murder, particularly, of girls. In &quot;Ar vamm lazherez&quot;, a woman kills her first twelve daughters before being killed by the thirteenth, who survives by supernatural means to carry out the revenge.

<text>Li Dazhao or Li Ta-chao (October 29, 1889 – April 28, 1927) was a Chinese intellectual and revolutionary who participated in the New Culture Movement in the early years of the Republic of China, established in 1912. He co-founded the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with Chen Duxiu in July 1921. He helped build a united front between the CCP and Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Nationalist Party (KMT) in early 1924. During the Northern Expedition, Li was arrested and then executed by warlord Zhang Zuolin in Beijing in April 1927.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Li was born into a peasant family in Laoting County, Hebei (previously Zhili) province in 1889. His childhood was miserable. His father died a few months before he was born, and his mother died when he was a baby. At the age of ten, Li married Zhao Renlan, who was nearly six years older; Li&#x27;s foster grandfather arranged the marriage for Li&#x27;s protection. He received his traditional education in three village schools in Laoting County for a decade. He started his modern education at Yongpingfu Middle school in 1905. From 1907 to 1913, he completed his college education at Beiyang College of Law and Politics in Tianjin. From 1914 to 1916, Li studied political economy at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan before returning to China in 1916. While there he lived in a YMCA dormitory and participated in Bible studies at the church of Yasuzo Shimizu. He did not finish his learning as he was expelled from Waseda for absence from his classes caused by his participation in the campaign against Yuan Shikai&#x27;s imperial endeavors, for which he returned to Shanghai in early 1916. A reporter visited the Waseda University Historical Museum to trace the youthful imprints of Li Dazhao during his study in Japan. In the winter of 1913, after graduating from Beiyang Law and Political School, Li Dazhao went to study in Japan, residing at the YMCA in Tokyo. In September 1914, he officially entered the Department of Political Economy at Waseda University. At Waseda University&#x27;s History and Archives Center, the reporter saw two tuition receipt books related to Li Dazhao, clearly recorded with a fountain pen: Li Dazhao paid 5 yen on September 9, 4.5 yen on October 26, 4.5 yen on November 9, and so on. Professor Emeritus Ando Hikotaro of Waseda University, in his book &quot;Building a Bridge to the Future: Waseda University and China,&quot; not only showed Li Dazhao&#x27;s transcript but also detailed the 11 courses he took and their respective instructors. He commented, “Compared to other Japanese students, Li Dazhao&#x27;s grades were quite good.” The scanned copy of Li Dazhao&#x27;s student registration card provided by the Waseda University Chinese Alumni Association clearly shows his name, address, place of origin, and enrollment information. Kawasoko Fumihiko noted that during his time at Beiyang Law and Political School, Li Dazhao actively learned Japanese and translated Nakazato Miyazosu&#x27;s &quot;The Program of Tolstoyism&quot; into Chinese in 1913, demonstrating his proficiency in Japanese even before arriving in Japan. In Japan, he continued to actively learn English while residing at the YMCA. In January 1915, during Li Dazhao&#x27;s first year at Waseda, Ōkuma Shigenobu, the then Prime Minister of Japan, and his cabinet secretly proposed the &quot;Twenty-One Demands&quot; to China. This provoked a strong response from Chinese students studying in Japan, and Li Dazhao actively joined their protest. He refused to take courses from professors like Ukita Kazutami, an ardent advocate of the &quot;Twenty-One Demands,&quot; and Hagino Nagayasu, a legal advisor to Yuan Shikai. Li Dazhao criticized them in articles like &quot;National Conditions.&quot; In February 1916, his student registration card was stamped with a withdrawal date and the reason &quot;removed due to prolonged absence.&quot; In April 1916, Li Dazhao, along with hundreds of other Chinese students in Japan, abandoned their education at prestigious Japanese institutions to join the domestic opposition against Yuan Shikai.

=== Head Librarian and Professor at Peking University ===
After returning to China, Li served as an editor in Beijing for a few newspapers on which he published numerous articles to promote democracy, freedom, constitutional rule, and national resurgence. As a leading intellectual in the New Culture Movement, he lashed out at China&#x27;s feudal tradition, criticized the old tyrannical past, and strongly endorsed the representative system. In January 1918, Li was hired by Cai Yuanpei to be the head of the library at Peking University in Beijing, and a couple of years later, he became a professor of politics, history, and economics there. He taught many different courses not only at Peking University, but also at four other universities in Beijing. He was invited as a speaker by associations, colleges, and other organizations throughout China. At Peking University, he influenced students during the May Fourth Movement of May 4, 1919, including Mao Zedong, who worked as an assistant in the library&#x27;s reading room. In a number of ways, &quot;Li&#x27;s urgent calls for democracy, science, and constitutional rule are an essential component of the brilliance of the May Fourth Movement.&quot;

More importantly, Li Dazhao was a prominent leader during the May Fourth Movement; he advised and coached young students in Beijing to take action against the Beiyang government and to protest against the imperialist powers&#x27; decision at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 to transfer the former German colonial privileges in Shandong to the Japanese Empire. During this time he published productively on a variety of topics championing new and progressive ideas, and became China&#x27;s earliest self-converted communist. He was one of the earliest scholars to explore the Bolshevik government in the Soviet Union as a possible model for his own nation. Throughout his life, Li maintained cordial relationship with other New Culture Movement figures such as Hu Shi and Lu Xun, even though they had diverse scholarly opinions and assumed different political stances.

=== Co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party ===
By many accounts, Li was a nationalist and believed that the Chinese nation could enjoy a renaissance by accepting a new culture, rejuvenating its people, and remolding its civilization. Li admired America for years but changed that attitude to be a pro-Russian intellectual in 1919. Like other intellectuals of his time, Li&#x27;s thinking was impacted by diverse elements such as Kropotkin&#x27;s anarchism. After the May Fourth Movement, he and other intellectuals started to turn to Marxism. The success of the Bolshevik Revolution was a factor in remolding his political views.

Later, Li combined his original nationalist thoughts and his newly acquired Marxist views to fashion his political visions for national salvation. Recent studies demonstrate that Li mainly read communism-related works from the Japanese sources which helped deepen his understanding of the communist ideology.

Li&#x27;s theory of political economy differed from the typical Marxist view that the urban proletariat was the revolutionary class. In Li&#x27;s view, China&#x27;s rural peasantry would be the key class-leveling force and the political source for revolution. 

Although some piecemeal articles referencing Marxism had been published in China previously, in 1918 Li became the first person in China to spread Marxism through significant published articles. In his 1919 essay &quot;My Marxist Views&quot; and his 1924 essay &quot;The Essentials of Historical Study&quot;, Li stated that generations make their own futures through harnessing social energies. In Li&#x27;s view, historical change occurred through linear stage-oriented progressions of civilizational improvement directed by via human agency.

Li initiated the Peking Socialist Youth Corps in 1920. He built China&#x27;s earliest socialist and communist groups in Beijing even before the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai. Li and Chen Duxiu were regarded as co-founders of the party.

===United Front with Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Nationalist Party===
Under the leadership of Li and Chen, the CCP developed a close relationship with the Soviet controlled Comintern. After the establishment of the CCP, Li and other early communists worked diligently to mobilize Chinese railway and mining workers to fight for their own rights. Directed by the Comintern, Li and Chen joined the Nationalist Party in 1922 and forged a close tie with Sun Yat-sen. Li was elected to the KMT&#x27;s Central Executive Committee in Guangzhou (Canton) in January 1924, which marked the formal formation of the First United Front between the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party. Both parties worked together to fight against their common enemies: the warlord government in Beijing and imperialist powers, which dominated many spheres of influence in China.

Li visited the Soviet Union in late 1924 and stayed there for months. Upon his return from Russia, he wooed the Christian warlord Feng Yuxiang to the Nationalist side, recruited young people into the two political parties, and organized numerous revolutionary activities. He urged Feng Yuxiang to adopt a strategy to fight against Zhang Zuolin from Northwestern China to Henan Province, which was crucial for the success of the Northern Expedition to topple down the warlord regime in Beijing.

=== Death ===

Tension between the Comintern and the CCP on one side and the KMT on another led to political intrigue, especially after Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s death in 1925. In any case, Li was instrumental in the United Front of the two political parties for which he served as its leader in North China. He helped organize anti-government demonstrations, in particular on March 18, 1926, in which government guards fired into the crowd, killing forty-seven people and wounding more than 200. After the March 18 Massacre, Li was put on the Beiyang government&#x27;s list of the most wanted. He took refuge in the Soviet Embassy in Beijing yet continued to lead political maneuvers in North China to topple the warlord&#x27;s government. When the United Front collapsed in 1927, Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian clique ordered a raid on the Embassy on April 6, even though violating diplomatic immunity, this action have already received supports from other foreign diplomatic missions. Li, his wife and daughter were jailed, but his wife and daughter were released shortly after Li was being executed. Li and nineteen other allies, both Nationalists and Communists, were secretly sentenced to death, and they were executed by strangulation on April 28, 1927.

==Legacy==

Li Dazhao left an enduring legacy upon modern Chinese history. As a leading intellectual of China&#x27;s New Cultural Movement, he wrote hundreds of articles to promote democracy, support constitutional government, endorse individual freedom, and called for a national revival. His ideological world might be complex as he incorporated diverse thoughts. His turn to communism was dramatic; from 1918 to 1919, he became China&#x27;s first communist, about a year earlier than Chen Duxiu.

Li&#x27;s thoughts on the role of peasants heavily influenced Mao Zedong. As one of the co-founders of the CCP, Li&#x27;s key role in decision-making for early communist activities and in bringing forth new theories significantly impacted the initial stage of the Chinese communist revolution. In a particular sense, Li Dazhao was a special bridge between the first two generations of the communist leadership; Maurice Meisner remarked that Li Dazhao was the CCP&#x27;s &quot;first true leader and its greatest martyr&quot; and that he &quot;represents the link between the older generation of democratically oriented and Western-educated intellectuals of the early phase of the New Cultural Movement (ca. 1915–1919), from whom the first Chinese Marxists emerged, and the new generation of young Communist intellectuals who inherited the party leadership after 1927.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;The Pioneer,&quot; a biopic was released about Li Dazhao starring Zhang Songwen as Li Dazhao. It premiered on July 1st, 2021 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

<doc id="468301" wikidata="Q230190" url="?curid=468301" title="Samantha Morton">
<text>Samantha Jane Morton (born 1977) is an English actress. She is known for her work in independent film with dark and tragic themes, in particular period dramas. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including the BAFTA Fellowship, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and nominations for two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

Morton was a member of the Central Junior Television Workshop in her native Nottingham and began her career in British television in 1991. She appeared in the ITV series &quot;Band of Gold&quot; (1995–1996) and the BBC miniseries &quot;The History of Tom Jones: a Foundling&quot; (1997). Morton&#x27;s early film roles include &quot;Emma&quot; (1996), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1997), and &quot;Under the Skin&quot; (1997). She received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Supporting Actress for Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999), and the other for Best Actress for Jim Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;In America&quot; (2003). Other notable film credits include &quot;Morvern Callar&quot; (2002), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004), &quot;Control&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), &quot;The Messenger&quot; (2009), &quot;John Carter&quot; (2012), &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Whale&quot; (2022).

For her portrayal of Myra Hindley in the Channel 4 and HBO film &quot;Longford&quot; (2006) she received Primetime Emmy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award nominations. Morton made her directorial debut with the television film &quot;The Unloved&quot; (2009), which won the BAFTA Television Award for Best Single Drama. She has starred in various programmes, such as &quot;The Last Panthers&quot; (2015), &quot;Rillington Place&quot; (2016), &quot;Harlots&quot; (2017–2019), &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2019–2020), and &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot; (2022–2024).

==Early life and education ==
Morton was born in Nottingham, the third child of Pamela (née Mallek), a factory worker, and Peter Morton. She is of Polish/Irish descent. She has five siblings from her parents&#x27; relationships subsequent to their 1979 divorce. She lived with her father until she was eight, when she was made a ward of court because neither of her parents could care for her and her siblings. Her father was an abusive alcoholic, and her mother was involved in a violent relationship with her second husband; as a result, she never lived with her parents again.

The next nine years were spent in and out of foster care and children&#x27;s homes. During that time, she attended West Bridgford Comprehensive School and joined the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, soon being offered small-screen roles in &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; and &quot;Boon&quot;. 

Under the effects of drugs, she threatened an older girl who had been bullying her. She was convicted of making threats to kill and served 18 weeks in an attendance centre.

==Career==
===Beginnings (1991–1998)===
After joining Central Junior Television Workshop at the age of 13, she was soon being offered small-screen roles such as Clare Anderson in the first series of Lucy Gannon&#x27;s &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; and also Mandy, in an episode of &quot;Boon&quot; —both were ITV Central productions. Moving to London at sixteen, Morton applied to numerous drama schools, including RADA, without success. In 1991, she attended Clarendon College of Performing Arts to gain a BTEC award but subsequently left for personal reasons. She made her stage début at the Royal Court Theatre, and continued her television career with appearances in &quot;Peak Practice&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Cracker&quot;. At the time, she had a regular role in the first two series of Kay Mellor&#x27;s successful &quot;Band of Gold&quot; (1995–96).

Further television roles followed, including parts in period dramas such as &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Emma&quot; was a film adaptation of the novel of the same name published in 1815 about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The movie received largely positive reviews from critics and was broadcast in late 1996 on ITV, gaining an estimated 12 million viewers. In &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Morton starred as a Yorkshire orphan who becomes a governess to a young French girl and finds love with the brooding lord of the manor. Like her previous small-screen projects, the 1997 film originally aired on ITV.

She took on the leading role in the independent drama &quot;Under the Skin&quot; (1997), directed by Carine Adler, where she played Iris, a woman coping with the death of her mother. The movie garnered favorable reviews from writers, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; placing it at number 15 on its list of the Best British Films 1984–2009. Janet Maslin for &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that Morton &quot;embodies the role with furious intensity and with a raw yet waifish presence&quot; and James Berardinelli wrote that the actress &quot;forces us to accept Iris as a living, breathing individual&quot;. She won the Best Actress accolade at the 1998 Boston Society of Film Critics Awards and was nominated for the BIFA for Best Female Performance in a British Independent Film.

===Critical recognition (1999–2005)===
Impressed by her performance in &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, Woody Allen cast her in &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, a romantic comedy about a fictional jazz guitarist in the 1930s (played by Sean Penn) who regards himself as the second greatest guitarist in the world. Morton played Hattie, a mute laundress and the love interest of Penn&#x27;s character. The film was released in September 1999, to wide critical acclaim and moderate success at the box office in the arthouse circuit. George Perry for BBC.com found her to be &quot;extraordinary&quot; as an &quot;adoring mute who suffers [...] She uses her eyes to convey meaning, reviving techniques of silent cinema&quot;. Morton earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role, which was especially notable, considering the fact that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film. During a 2007 interview with UK&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she remarked that her Oscar nomination meant &quot;incredible things for me in the [United States]. I&#x27;m grateful for that. It means that [...] I&#x27;m able to support the industry&quot;.

Morton would next star in the small scale drama &quot;Jesus&#x27; Son&quot;, which found a limited release, and praise from critics. She received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance. Her other film in 1999 was the romantic drama &quot;Dreaming of Joseph Lees&quot;, an adaptation of a story written by Catherine Linstrum set in rural England in the late 1950s; for her part, she won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actress. She appeared in the biographical drama &quot;Pandaemonium&quot; (2000), directed by Julien Temple, playing Sara Coleridge, the wife of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. She was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Actress. Morton also played a mermaid opposite Larry Mullen in the Anton Corbijn-directed promotional video for U2&#x27;s &quot;Electrical Storm&quot;, and provided the voice of Ruby for the Canadian animated series &quot;Max &amp; Ruby&quot; from 2002 to 2003.

Morton found wider recognition and mainstream success when she took on the part of a senior precog in Steven Spielberg science fiction thriller &quot;Minority Report&quot;, opposite Tom Cruise. Although critics felt she was &quot;slightly typecast&quot; in her role of &quot;feral, near-mute victim&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; grossed US$358 million. She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Empire Award for Best British Actress. In her next film, the drama &quot;Morvern Callar&quot;, she played a grieving young woman from Scotland who decides to escape to Spain after the suicide of her boyfriend. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers stated that Morton &quot;fills this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling&quot;, as part of a positive critical response, and she earned the Best Actress Award at the 5th British Independent Film Awards and the 7th Toronto Film Critics Association Awards.

In the independent drama &quot;In America&quot; (2003), directed by Jim Sheridan, Morton played the matriarch of an immigrant Irish family struggling to start a new life in New York. &quot;In America&quot; met widespread critical acclaim, with Terry Lawson of &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; calling the film &quot;an achingly intimate and beautifully observed account of the immigrant experience&quot;. Roger Ebert felt that Morton &quot;reveals the power of her silences, her quiet [and] her presence&quot;, while A.O. Scott, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found the &quot;blunt, inarticulate force of her feeling [...] at the center of the drama&quot;. Her performance earned her nominations for the Academy Award, the Independent Spirit Award, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award in the category of Best Actress.

In 2004, Morton starred as a love interest in the dystopian film &quot;Code 46&quot;, directed by Michael Winterbottom and alongside Tim Robbins, and played the wife of a man who witnessed a deadly accident in the drama &quot;Enduring Love&quot;, opposite Rhys Ifans and Daniel Craig. Critics were polarized for the latter film and suggested that Morton did not have enough time on screen. Nevertheless, she earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Award at the 2004 British Independent Film Awards. In &quot;River Queen&quot; (2005), she took on the role of a young Irish woman finding herself on both sides of the wars between British and Maori during the British colonisation of New Zealand. The film was a box office success at the New Zealand box office, grossing around NZ$1 million in the country. For her role, she received a nomination for the New Zealand Screen Award for Best Leading Actress. She starred alongside Johnny Depp in the little-seen period drama &quot;The Libertine&quot;, and appeared in the drama &quot;Lassie&quot;, both of which were also released in 2005.

===Biopics and directorial debut (2006–2009)===

In 2006, she played the Moors murderess Myra Hindley in the television film &quot;Longford&quot;. Set between 1967 and 1997, the film depicts the relationship between the child murderer and Lord Longford, the politician who spent years campaigning (ultimately unsuccessfully) for her release. &quot;Longford&quot; was a critical success and premiered with 1.7 million viewers. Morton, however, was severely criticised by the relatives of the children who were killed by Hindley and Ian Brady, but she insisted, &quot;It is my duty as a performer to raise issues [...] we&#x27;re afraid to look at&quot;. She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, and won at the 65th Golden Globe Awards.

Morton took on roles in four feature films in 2007. She starred as a struggling police officer in the romantic drama &quot;Expired&quot;, and portrayed a Marilyn Monroe impersonator in the dramedy &quot;Mister Lonely&quot;. Morton worked again with director Anton Corbijn in the biographical film &quot;Control&quot;, where she appeared as Deborah Curtis, wife of musician Ian Curtis from the band Joy Division, whose biography &quot;Touching from a Distance&quot; formed the basis of the film. The film was acclaimed by critics. Roger Ebert remarked that Morton was &quot;absolutely convincing as a plucky teenage bride&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; magazine found her performance to be &quot;astonishing&quot; and &quot;sympathetic&quot;. For &quot;Control&quot;, she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Her last film of 2007 was another biopic, &quot;&quot;, in which she played Mary, Queen of Scots.

She made part of an ensemble cast in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s postmodern drama &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Williams and Emily Watson. In the film, she portrayed Hazel, one of the women in the life of a theatre director (Hoffman) whose extreme commitment to a realistic stage production begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality. As her character ages from 30 to 64 over the course of the story, Morton used full-face prosthetic makeup. She discovered that she was pregnant during the filming, which had a schedule that took up to 20 hours a day. The film was a box office bomb, but garnered praise from critics, appearing on many top ten lists of the year. Morton and her co-stars were eventually nominated for the Best Ensemble Performance award at the 18th Gotham Independent Film Awards. Also in 2008, she starred in &quot;The Daisy Chain&quot;, an Irish horror film about a couple who after the death of their daughter, take in an orphaned girl, only to become involved in a series of strange occurrences. It premiered at the 16th Raindance Film Festival (London; October 2008), and received a DVD release in 2010.

In the directorial debut of &quot;Jesus&#x27; Son&quot; screenwriter Oren Moverman, the war drama &quot;The Messenger&quot; (2009), Morton starred as Oliva Patterson, a widow whose husband was killed in Iraq. She was drawn to the &quot;feminine&quot; side of the story and found her part to be &quot;one of the first characters [she has] played in a long time where [she has] felt so much in common&quot;, as her brother and stepfather both served as soldiers in the military forces. Critical reception towards &quot;The Messenger&quot; and Morton was unanimously favorable, with Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; asserting that, Morton &quot;as always, gives a subtle, excellent performance&quot;. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 14th Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards and the 25th Independent Spirit Awards.
Morton&#x27;s other project of 2009 was her directorial debut, the semi-autobiographical Channel 4 drama &quot;The Unloved&quot;, which follows an eleven-year-old girl (played by Molly Windsor) growing up in a children&#x27;s home in the UK&#x27;s care system, and shown through her perspective. Morton wrote the story in collaboration with Tony Grisoni, and &quot;The Unloved&quot; was first broadcast on 17 May 2009, drawing nearly 2 million viewers. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009. Michael Deacon, for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, praised Morton on creating an &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;vivid&quot; dramatic film. Morton won a BAFTA for her direction in 2010.

===Hiatus and return to film (2010–2014)===
Following a three-year hiatus from the screen to focus on her personal life and family, Morton returned in 2012. She provided the voice of Sola in the science fiction film &quot;John Carter&quot;, based on &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, which received mixed reviews and flopped at the box office. She next played a chief of theory in the thriller &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;, directed by David Cronenberg. Her role, described as &quot;misjudged&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, earned her a nomination as Best Actress in a Canadian Film Award at the Vancouver Film Critics Circle. She also served as a jury member at the 69th Venice International Film Festival in 2012.

Morton was the original voice of the artificially intelligent operating system in the 2013 romantic science fiction drama &quot;Her&quot; directed by Spike Jonze, but in post-production, she was replaced by Scarlett Johansson. She is, however, credited as an associate producer. Morton starred in the independent drama &quot;Decoding Annie Parker&quot; (2013) opposite Helen Hunt, playing a woman with breast cancer. The film was released in limited theaters, to mixed reviews from critics. Nevertheless, Betsey Sharkey of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; observed that the actress &quot;gives Parker such a humility within a warm humanity that you feel an obligation to stick with her through the mounting horrors&quot;. She was awarded the Best Actress Golden Space Needle Award at the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival.

Morton starred opposite Michael Shannon in the independent thriller &quot;The Harvest&quot; (also 2013), as a controlling mother keeping her sick son in a secluded environment. Several critics such as Peter Debruge (&quot;Variety&quot;) and Nikola Grozdanovic (&quot;Indiewire&quot;) compared her role of Katherine to Kathy Bates&#x27; Annie Wilkes in &quot;Misery&quot; (1990). Her performance earned her a Best Actress Award nomination at the 2014 BloodGuts UK Horror Awards.

In Liv Ullmann&#x27;s film adaptation &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (2014), alongside Colin Farrell and Jessica Chastain, Morton portrayed Kathleen, the fiancée of a valet (Farrell) who finds himself seduced by the daughter of an Anglo-Irish aristocracy (Chastain). The film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited release in the UK, France and Spain. &quot;Miss Julie&quot; rated average with reviewers, but the cast received acclaim. Writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, David Rooney thought Morton&#x27;s Kathleen was &quot;the most satisfyingly drawn character&quot; of the film, which he considered a &quot;ponderous, stately affair&quot;.

===Roles in television (2015–present)===
In 2015, Morton starred as a mother in the First World War context in &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot;, a made-for-television adaptation of the book of the same name by Laurie Lee, and took on the role of an insurance investigator charged with recovering stolen diamonds in the European limited television series &quot;The Last Panthers&quot;, inspired by the notorious Balkan jewel thieves the Pink Panthers. Morton found her character to be a &quot;very truthful, [...] strong woman&quot; and described her as a &quot;female Bond&quot;. Genevieve Valentine, for &quot;The AV Club&quot;, wrote: &quot;Morton might at first seem a tough sell as someone so hard-boiled, but the taciturn, untouchable edifice she presents is leaking just enough poison at the edges that we look forward to watching her strike—the sort of character a six-hour miniseries was made for&quot;.

Morton appeared in &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016), a spin-off from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, with a screenplay by J. K. Rowling. In the film, she portrayed Mary Lou Barebone, the leader of an extremist group whose goals include exposing and killing wizards and witches. &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; grossed US$814 million at the international box office, becoming Morton&#x27;s most successful and widely seen film.

She filmed the three-part television crime drama &quot;Rillington Place&quot; (also 2016), based on the case of serial killer John Christie, who murdered several women in London during 1940s and early 1950s. Morton was cast opposite Tim Roth as Christie&#x27;s wife, Ethel. Intrigued by their relationship, Morton felt the depiction of the &quot;psychological aspect of love&quot; in the story &quot;really developed [her] acting chops&quot; but considered as a challenge &quot;to play someone so submissive&quot; as Ethel. The miniseries premiered in BBC One and was favourably received by critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; found Morton to be &quot;strong&quot; in her &quot;difficult role&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot; remarked that she &quot;gave a fine, nuanced performance&quot; as &quot;a woman trapped under her husband&#x27;s spell&quot;.

Beginning in 2017, Morton has starred in the Hulu period drama series &quot;Harlots&quot;. She portrays Margaret Wells, the madam of a low-class brothel who seeks to improve her fortunes. The response from critics and audiences has been highly positive. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; found her to be the &quot;standout performer&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; noted: &quot;While the role doesn&#x27;t give Morton the same room to flex her acting muscles as, say, Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot;, she gives depth and moral conflict to a character who could easily be a pantomime dame in the wrong hands&quot;.

In July 2018, it was announced that Morton had been cast in the role of Alpha in &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, making her first appearance in February 2019. Alpha is the villainous leader of the Whisperers, a mysterious group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse who—as a method of self-concealment—wear skins taken from the undead.

Since September 11, 2022, Morton stars as Catherine de&#x27; Medici in the Starz television series &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot;. Also in 2022, Morton returned to the big screen in three different roles: in &quot;The Whale&quot; she played the ex-wife of Brendan Fraser&#x27;s reclusive and morbidly obese professor; in &quot;Save the Cinema&quot; she starred as a hairdresser campaigning to save a local theater from closing; and in &quot;She Said&quot;, Morton played a Zelda Perkins, a former Miramax employee who revealed to &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Jodi Kantor the details of non-disclosure agreements by which sexual assault victims of Harvey Weinstein were bound. 

==Personal life==
Morton dated actor Charlie Creed-Miles, whom she met on the set of the film &quot;The Last Yellow&quot;, in 1999. They broke up when Morton was 15 weeks pregnant with their daughter, actress Esmé Creed-Miles, born in February 2000.

Morton met filmmaker Harry Holm (son of actor Ian Holm) while filming a music video for the band The Vitamins. They had a daughter and a son, and as of 2012 lived in Monyash, Derbyshire.

In early 2008, Morton revealed that she had been &quot;close to death&quot; after suffering a debilitating stroke after being hit on the head by a piece of 17th-century plaster, damaging her vertebral artery, in 2006. She was in hospital for three weeks after the incident. She took an 18-month break from public life and acting to learn to walk again.

In 2011, Morton wrote an open letter to her stepfather, hoping they would get back in touch after being estranged for several years. However, it was soon revealed that her stepfather had died of prostate cancer four years previously.

On 20 July 2011, Morton received an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) from Nottingham Trent University, &quot;in recognition of her internationally successful acting career&quot;.

Morton is a Catholic and describes herself as &#x27;quite religious.&#x27;

==Charity work==
Having been raised in the foster care system, Morton has often been active in related causes. In March 2009, Morton returned to her hometown to show her support for its children&#x27;s homes and protest against the threatened closure, by Nottingham City Council, of one of the four establishments with 24 social-care staff facing redundancy. In 2012, Morton showed her support for the Fostering Network&#x27;s annual campaign &quot;Foster Care Fortnight&quot;, and in September 2014, triggered by the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, she discussed in a video interview the sexual abuse she experienced while in the foster care system as a child in Nottingham and that the police took no action when she reported the abuse. Morton had discussed the abuse previously while promoting the semi-autobiographical drama &quot;The Unloved&quot;, in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2008, she was part of the Vodafone Foundation&#x27;s World of Difference campaign, which gives people the opportunity to work for a charity of their choice. Whilst attending a fundraiser for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in January 2009, she vowed never to work for the BBC again after their refusal to broadcast an emergency charity appeal for the victims of Israel&#x27;s attack on Gaza on 27 December 2008. She was later joined by Tam Dean Burn, Pauline Goldsmith, Peter Mullan, and Alison Peebles, who also threatened to boycott the corporation. In 2009, she also fronted a television advertising recruitment campaign for social workers in the UK.

<text>Bartholomew Thomas Stupak (; born February 29, 1952) is an American politician and lobbyist. A member of the Democratic Party, Stupak served as the U.S. representative from from 1993 to 2011.

Stupak chose not to seek re-election in 2010. He departed Congress in January 2011, and was succeeded by Dan Benishek, a Republican from the Upper Peninsula. Stupak is now a lobbyist with Venable LLP.

==Early life, education and career==
Stupak was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Gladstone High School in Gladstone, Michigan in 1970. He is an Eagle Scout. He earned his Associate&#x27;s degree from Northwestern Michigan College, a community college in Traverse City in 1972. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in criminal justice from Saginaw Valley State University in 1977, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and he earned a J.D. degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan in 1981. He worked as an Escanaba police officer in 1972. Stupak later served as a Michigan State Police Trooper from 1973 to 1984 and as a member of C-Street while in Congress. He also practiced law.

==Michigan legislature==
In 1988, Stupak was elected a Michigan State Representative, representing Menominee, Delta, and Dickinson counties, defeating two-term Republican Jim Connors. In 1990, Stupak ran for state senator but lost a hotly contested primary to eventual general election winner Don Koivisto.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

==Political campaigns==

In 1992, Stupak ran for the House of Representatives in the 1st District, covering the Upper Peninsula and the northernmost swath of the Lower Peninsula. The district had previously been the 11th, represented by retiring seven-term incumbent Republican Robert William Davis. Stupak won the heavily contested Democratic primary, and defeated Republican Philip Ruppe, Davis&#x27; predecessor, in the general election. He was the first Democrat to represent this district since 1967, and only the third Democrat to win it in the 20th century. He was easily reelected in 1994 during a bad year for Democrats, becoming the first Democrat in 56 years to be elected to more than one term in the Northern Michigan district.

Stupak defeated Republican Don Hooper of Iron River in the 2002, 2004 and 2006 elections, and Republican Tom Casperson In 2008.

On April 9, 2010, Stupak announced that he would not run for re-election, and that he would retire from Congress at the end of his then-current term.

===Campaign funding===
Electric utilities and health care professionals were among the top four industries contributing to his campaigns in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Of his top 20 largest contributors throughout his political career, 16 were unions and associations, two were energy companies, one was an insurance company and one was a telecommunications firm.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection
**Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet
**Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation (Chairman)

===Caucus memberships===
*Founder and co-chair of the Law Enforcement Caucus
*Co-chair of the Congressional Northern Border Caucus
*Member, Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus

During his service in Congress, Stupak sponsored 36 bills, but none became law. He cosponsored 157 bills, 5 of which were enacted into law. He voted with the members of his party 96% of the time, and abstained from 5% of the votes. Because of the 1st District&#x27;s extensive length of Great Lakes shoreline (over 1,600 miles), Stupak was very active on issues related to the protection of the Great Lakes, including opposing sale or diversion of Great Lakes water and drilling for oil and gas under the lakes.

==Political positions==

=== Financial system ===
In 2009, Stupak voted against the Dodd–Frank Act, which expanded Federal regulation and oversight of the US financial system in the aftermath of the US financial and banking crisis of that year.

=== Civil liberties ===
Stupak voted for the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity.

=== Health care ===

Stupak expressed a desire to support the 2009 health care reform bill put forth by President Obama, but wanted restrictions on coverage for abortion. Therefore, Stupak and Republican Congressman Joseph R. Pitts submitted an amendment known as the Stupak–Pitts Amendment to prohibit such payments. The Stupak–Pitts Amendment was adopted by the House of Representatives, but a similar provision was defeated in the Senate version of the legislation (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Stupak announced that he and several other Democratic representatives who supported health reform legislation but opposed abortion would not vote for the final version of the legislation unless the Stupak-Pitts Amendment was included. The ensuing controversy made Stupak &quot;perhaps the single most important rank-and-file House member in passing the bill.&quot;

Abortion-rights advocates held a &quot;Stop Stupak&quot; rally on Capitol Hill in December 2009. In the ensuing months, Stupak publicly stated that the pressure and opposition he received in regard to his abortion stance on the health reform legislation had caused him to unplug the phone at his house due to &quot;obscene phone calls and threats&quot; and had made his life a &quot;living hell.&quot; &quot;My staff is overwhelmed and we&#x27;re accosted basically wherever we go by people who disagree,&quot; Stupak added.

In March 2010, President Obama and Stupak reached an understanding whereby the President promised to sign an Executive Order barring federal funding of abortion through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Stupak and several of his allies promised to withdraw their opposition to the bill. Anti-abortion advocates accused Stupak of betraying their movement, with the Susan B. Anthony List revoking an award it had planned to give to him and instead running $150,000 worth of radio advertisements against him. Stupak was targeted by the Tea Party movement in the wake of his compromise. In April 2010, Stupak announced his intention to retire from Congress, leading conservative groups to point to the political consequences of his compromise as a possible reason for his decision. However, Stupak himself attributed his retirement to the exertion of constant travel back and forth from Washington, D.C.

Stupak also supports a public option and single-payer healthcare.

==Apartment controversy==
Stupak rented a room at the C Street Center, a Washington, D.C. facility of The Fellowship (also known as The Family), a Christian fraternal organization. The Fellowship has been the subject of controversy over its claimed tax status as a church, the ownership of the property and its connection to the Fellowship, and the reportedly subsidized benefits the facility provides to members of Congress.

Jeff Sharlet, author of a book about The Fellowship, said, &quot;When I lived with The Family at Ivanwald, a house for younger men being groomed for leadership, I was told that Stupak was a regular visitor to the Cedars.&quot; The Cedars, according to the &quot;Washington Independent&quot;, is also owned by The Family and hosts weekly prayer events. Stupak has denied any affiliation with the Family and appeared to deny knowledge of the organization, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t belong to any such group&quot; and that &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, [The] Family and all this other stuff.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stupak lives in Menominee, Michigan, with his wife, Laurie, who is a former mayor of , and unsuccessful candidate for the Michigan House of Representatives. Laurie Stupak was defeated by Tom Casperson. In 2008 Casperson unsuccessfully challenged Bart Stupak, the incumbent for Michigan&#x27;s 1st Congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives.

The Stupaks&#x27; son Ken graduated from Pepperdine University&#x27;s School of Law in 2006 and resides in California. Their other son, Bart Jr., died by suicide in May 2000. Congressman Stupak testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee&#x27;s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee during a 2002 hearing on the safety of Accutane, an acne medication, which he believes contributed to his son&#x27;s death.

<text>Cornelis Piet Hoekstra (; born October 30, 1953) is a Dutch-American politician who served as the United States Ambassador to the Netherlands from January 10, 2018, to January 17, 2021. President-Elect Trump announced that he will nominate him to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to Canada on November 20, 2024. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1993 to 2011.

Born in the Netherlands, Hoekstra emigrated to the United States as a child. In 1992, Hoekstra ran for the U.S. House, defeating thirteen-term incumbent Guy Vander Jagt in the Republican primary and Democratic opponent John H. Miltner in the general election. Hoekstra was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee from 2004 to 2007. He was a candidate for governor in Michigan&#x27;s 2010 gubernatorial election, but came in second to Rick Snyder in the Republican primary. Hoekstra was also the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 2012, losing to Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow in the general election.

In July 2017, Hoekstra was nominated to be United States ambassador to the Netherlands by President Donald Trump. This nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on November 9, 2017, and Hoekstra was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador on December 11, 2017. He took office on January 10, 2018. During his tenure, he gained notability for making anti-Muslim comments. He left office on January 17, 2021. On January 20, 2024, Hoekstra was elected chair of the Michigan Republican Party. He is listed as a &quot;contributor&quot; to Project 2025.

On November 20, 2024, Hoekstra was nominated to be the United States ambassador to Canada by President-elect Trump.

==Early life and education==
Hoekstra was born Cornelis Piet Hoekstra in Groningen, Netherlands. He moved to the U.S. with his parents at the age of three, and Anglicized his name to Peter Hoekstra. He graduated from Holland Christian High School (Holland, Michigan) in 1971. He received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Hope College in 1975 and an MBA from the University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business in 1977. He then joined office furniture maker Herman Miller and remained there for 15 years, eventually becoming vice president of marketing.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1992, Hoekstra made his first bid for public office in the 2nd District. The district, previously the 9th, had been represented for 26 years by Guy Vander Jagt, longtime chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Hoekstra rode his bicycle across the district, charging that Vander Jagt had served in Congress for too long; Vander Jagt had won his first election in 1966, when Hoekstra was 13 years old. He scored a monumental upset, winning by almost six percent. Hoekstra dominated the district&#x27;s more populated southern portion; Vander Jagt&#x27;s margins in the northern portion, his longtime base, weren&#x27;t enough to close the gap. This primary win was tantamount to election in a district reckoned as Michigan&#x27;s most Republican district; the GOP has held the district for all but four years since it was created in 1873. Hoekstra later defeated Democrat John H. Miltner and Libertarian Dick Jacobs in the general election, with 63% of the vote. Hoekstra continued to ride his bicycle across the district every summer, and biked across the state for his gubernatorial campaign.

When he was first elected, Hoekstra initially pledged to serve no more than six terms (12 years) in the House. However, in 2004, he announced he would break that pledge and seek a seventh term. In 2006, Hoekstra&#x27;s Leadership PAC (the Mileage Fund) raised nearly $160,000 in Political Action Contributions from contributors including the Teamsters, Michigan Credit Union League, and Little Planet Books.

Hoekstra faced no significant opposition in the Republican primary or in the general election (as in his previous five reelection campaigns) and went on to secure his seventh term. Shortly after the primary, he was named chairman of the Intelligence Committee, succeeding Porter Goss, who became Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

====2006====

Hoekstra had no primary opponent. In November he was opposed by the Democratic candidate Kimon Kotos, who was also his 2004 opponent. Hoekstra defeated Kotos 183,518 votes to 87,361 votes.

====2008====
Hoekstra ran for re-election in 2008 against Fred Johnson, associate professor of History at Hope College. He beat Johnson by 215,471 to 119,959 votes.

===Tenure===
Hoekstra had a conservative voting record, consistent with the conservative nature of the 2nd congressional district. He opposed abortion rights, opposed expanding health care benefits for children, opposed gay adoption rights and gay marriage, and voted against paid parental leave for federal employees. However, he also opposed amending the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration.

==== Gun laws ====
Hoekstra consistently opposed gun control during his tenure, earning an A rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. In 2005 he voted to prohibit product lawsuits against gun manufacturers. In 1994 he voted against the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

====False claims about WMDs in Iraq====
Hoekstra was a proponent of the claim that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and held onto this belief even after no WMDs were found in the wake of the Iraq invasion. In 2006, Hoekstra made headlines by announcing at a press conference in the Capitol that weapons of mass destruction had been located in Iraq in the form of 500 chemical weapons. However, the weapons in question were defunct munitions, manufactured prior to the 1991 Gulf War and which had been scattered throughout Iraq. The media had already reported on these munitions when Hoekstra made his announcement that the weapons had been discovered. Hoekstra&#x27;s insistence that the Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction were disputed by both Pentagon officials, the Duelfer Report, and the intelligence community.

On November 3, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a website created at the request of Hoekstra and Senator Pat Roberts was found to contain detailed information that could potentially be helpful to those seeking to produce nuclear weapons. The website was shut down on November 2 following questioning by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

As of September 17, 2007, some news outlets reported that the Congressional committee Hoekstra had overseen had created &quot;erroneous&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot; reports about Iran&#x27;s nuclear capabilities. &quot;Among the committee&#x27;s assertions is that Iran is producing weapons-grade uranium at its facility in the town of Natanz. The IAEA called that &quot;incorrect&quot;, noting that weapons-grade uranium is enriched to a level of 90 percent or more. Iran has enriched uranium to 3.5 percent under IAEA monitoring.&quot;

====Operation Iraqi Freedom documents====
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, some 48,000 boxes of documents, audiotapes and videotapes were discovered by the U.S. military. In March 2006, the U.S. government, at the urging of members of Congress, made them available online at its Foreign Military Studies Office website, requesting Arabic translators around the world to help in the translation. On April 18, 2006, about a month after the first documents were made public, Hoekstra, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a news release acknowledging &quot;minimal risks,&quot; but saying the site &quot;will enable us to better understand information such as Saddam&#x27;s links to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and violence against the Iraqi people.&quot; He added: &quot;It will allow us to leverage the Internet to enable a mass examination as opposed to limiting it to a few exclusive elites.&quot;

In early November 2006, the entire set of documents was removed. Media reports stated that the website was taken offline because of security concerns regarding the posting of sophisticated diagrams and other information regarding nuclear weapon design prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

====Repatriation of Yemeni captives in Guantanamo====
On December 27, 2009, Hoekstra commented on reports that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who had allegedly tried to set off a suicide bomb on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, had subsequently confessed to being trained and equipped in Yemen.
Hoekstra called for a halt to the repatriation of Yemeni captives in Guantanamo.

====Tea Party Caucus====
Hoekstra was a founding member of the Congressional House Tea Party Caucus in 2010.

===Committee assignments===
* Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
** As ranking member of the full committee, Rep. Hoekstra may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees
* Committee on Education and Labor
** Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
** Subcommittee on Workforce Protections

===Caucus memberships===
* Founding chairman of the Education Freedom Caucus
* Founding chairman of the Congressional Caucus on the Netherlands

==2010 gubernatorial election==

In December 2008, Hoekstra said he would not seek re-election to his U.S. House seat in 2010, and instead campaign to be Michigan&#x27;s governor. Hoekstra joined Mike Bouchard, the Oakland County Sheriff and former state senator, former Gateway, Inc. president Rick Snyder, State Senator Tom George and Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox as 2010 Republican gubernatorial candidates. In the primary, held on August 3, 2010, Hoekstra finished second to Snyder.




==2012 U.S. Senate election==
Hoekstra was suggested as a possible challenger for Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow in the 2012 Senate election, but he initially declined to run. Hoekstra later changed his mind and decided to challenge Stabenow in the election. On August 29, 2011, Hoekstra was endorsed by Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, and on September 23, 2011, Hoekstra was endorsed by 2012 Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann.

Hoekstra faced Stabenow and four third-party candidates in the general election. On November 6, 2012, Hoekstra was defeated by Stabenow, receiving 38% of the vote.




===Ad controversy===
Hoekstra targeted Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow with a television ad which ran statewide during the 2012 Super Bowl. The 30-second ad, created by Republican advertising consultant Fred Davis III, opened with the sound of a gong and the image of a Chinese woman (played by 2012 Miss Napa Valley Lisa Chan) riding a bike alongside a rice paddy. The ad sarcastically accused Stabenow of contributing to the U.S.&#x27; spending problem, with the woman thanking &quot;Michigan Senator Debbie Spenditnow&quot;, in broken English, implying Stabenow has earned China&#x27;s gratitude for making the U.S. economy &quot;very weak&quot; while China&#x27;s &quot;get very good&quot;.

The commercial included a link to a Hoekstra campaign website with statistics about federal spending, decorated with images of Chinese flags and currency and using a stereotypical Chinatown font. In the HTML code on Hoekstra&#x27;s site, the woman in the ad is identified as &quot;yellowgirl&quot;. A statement released by the Hoekstra campaign said the HTML code was mistakenly shortened from &quot;yellowshirtgirl&quot;.

Asian-American groups called the ad &quot;very disturbing&quot;, and two of Hoekstra&#x27;s GOP opponents, Clark Durant and Gary Glenn, questioned whether Hoekstra was the right candidate for Republicans to support. The ad was criticized by Michael Yaki, former aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and U.S. Senator Dan Inouye. James Fallows of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; called it the &quot;most revolting ad&quot;. The NAACP denounced the ad as an &quot;unnecessary race card.&quot;

The ad proved costly for Hoekstra; several polls reported him losing ground to Stabenow in a head-to-head match-up.

Hoekstra initially stood by the ad, claiming it hit Stabenow &quot;smack dab between the eyes&quot; on the economy. However, on February 10, 2012, Hoekstra shut down his controversial Chinese-themed website and phased in a new TV commercial in place of his original ad. American Values super PAC, an Asian American group, claimed credit for the scrub shortly after the group&#x27;s launch of an online viral ad condemning Hoekstra.

On February 16, Chan apologized for her involvement in the ad. In a statement on her Facebook page, she said the role was &quot;not in any way representative of who I am&quot; and &quot;absolutely a mistake on my part.&quot;

Despite the controversy, Hoekstra won the Republican primary. He lost to Stabenow in the general election.

==Post-political career==
In February 2011, Hoekstra joined the government relations group and Washington, D.C. law firm Dickstein Shapiro, and was named a visiting distinguished fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, concentrating on education reform. In 2014, Hoekstra left Dickstein Shapiro to join one of its rivals, Greenberg Traurig.

Hoekstra joined Steven Emerson&#x27;s Investigative Project on Terrorism in 2014 as a Shillman Senior Fellow, specializing in national security, international relations, global terrorism and cyber security.

Hoekstra published his first book in October 2015, &quot;Architects of Disaster: The Destruction of Libya&quot; with Terri Blumenfeld.

In an interview with NPR&#x27;s Robert Siegel on December 10, 2014, Hoekstra said he disagreed with the recently released Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture.

CNN&#x27;s KFile reported that Hoekstra in 2016 accused Huma Abedin of ties with the Muslim Brotherhood. A 2016 &quot;Washington Post&quot; fact-checker gave Hoekstra&#x27;s claim &quot;four Pinocchios&quot;. CNN also stated that Hoekstra was a frequent guest on a talk show hosted by Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist based in Washington.

On March 11, 2017, Hoekstra said that Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other leakers of government materials, having illegally released classified information, were traitors and should have taken their evidence to the intelligence committees of the U.S. Congress for proper investigations.

==U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands==
On July 24, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Hoekstra to be United States ambassador to the Netherlands. He was confirmed by the Senate on November 9 via voice vote and sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on December 11, 2017. He took office on January 10, 2018.

===Anti-Muslim comments===

Later that December, NOS U.S. correspondent Wouter Zwart questioned Hoekstra about inaccurate claims that he had made in November 2015 at a panel titled &quot;Muslim Migration into Europe: Eurabia come True?&quot; hosted by the David Horowitz Freedom Center that the Netherlands had &quot;no-go zones&quot; and that politicians and cars were being set on fire in the country due to radical Islam. Hoekstra told Zwart that he had never said such things, saying, &quot;we would call it fake news. I never said that.&quot; Zwart then played the clip in which he made those remarks for his viewers. Later in the interview, Hoekstra denied that he denied it, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t call it &#x27;fake news&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t use those words today.&quot; On December 23, Hoekstra issued an apology on Twitter, writing that he &quot;made certain remarks in 2015 and regret[ted] the exchange during the &quot;Nieuwsuur&quot; interview&quot;.

On January 10, 2018, during his press conference after presenting his credentials to King Willem-Alexander, Hoekstra said that he did not want to revisit the comments made in 2015. Despite repeated questions from Dutch reporters regarding these comments, Hoekstra refused to talk about these statements and refused to answer further questions.

On January 11, 2018, Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Steve Goldstein said that in 2015, Hoekstra &quot;made comments that should not have been made&quot;, that &quot;the State Department does not agree with those statements&quot; and &quot;that is not the language we would use.&quot; He added that the &quot;comments were wrong and don&#x27;t reflect the U.S. view of the Netherlands&quot;. One day later, in an interview with Dutch newspaper &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;, Hoekstra finally retracted his statement about the presence of &quot;no-go zones&quot; in the Netherlands where cars and politicians are being set on fire, saying: &quot;Looking back, I&#x27;m dismayed that I said it. It was an incorrect statement. It was just wrong.&quot; He further claimed that he could not recall how he got to the statement or what it was based on, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve mixed up countries. I was wrong, and I don&#x27;t know how that could have happened. I do know: it was wrong.&quot;

===Interference in Dutch politics===
In September 2020, a group of Dutch officials demanded answers from Hoekstra in response to reports that he had hosted a fund-raising event at the U.S. embassy for the far right Dutch political party Forum for Democracy, a potential violation of international law. This is not the first time Hoekstra has been associated with the far-right party. In May 2020, Hoekstra was interviewed by party leader Thierry Baudet on the party&#x27;s video channel and he was also a guest speaker at the party&#x27;s conference in November 2019.

== Chair of the Michigan Republican Party ==
On January 20, 2024, Hoekstra was elected chair of the Michigan Republican Party.

Hoekstra is listed as a &quot;contributor&quot; to Project 2025.

== Nomination as U.S. ambassador to Canada ==
On November 20, 2024, Hoekstra was announced as the United States ambassador to Canada by President-elect Trump. On February 12, 2025, his nomination was sent to the Senate. His nomination is pending before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<text>Vernon James Ehlers (February 6, 1934 – August 15, 2017) was an American physicist and politician who represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 until his retirement in 2011. A Republican, he also served eight years in the Michigan Senate and two in the Michigan House of Representatives.

Ehlers was the first research physicist to be elected to Congress; he was later joined by Rush Holt, Jr. (D-NJ) and Bill Foster (D-IL).

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Born in Pipestone, Minnesota, Ehlers attended Calvin College in Grand Rapids for three years before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned an undergraduate degree in physics and, in 1960, a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;The nuclear spins and moments of several radioactive gallium isotopes&quot;, is available from University Microfilms International as document number 0227304. After six years of teaching and research at Berkeley, he moved back to Michigan and took employment at Calvin College in 1966, where he taught physics for 16 years and later served as chairman of the Physics Department.

Ehlers died on August 15, 2017, at the age of 83.

==Early political career==
Ehlers served on the Kent County Board of Commissioners from 1975 to 1982. Ehlers served from 1983 to 1985 in the Michigan House of Representatives and then served from 1985 to 1993 in the Michigan Senate.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Education and Labor
** Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
** Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning, and Competitiveness
* Committee on House Administration (Chairman and Ranking Member) 
* Committee on Science and Technology
** Subcommittee on Energy and Environment
** Subcommittee on Research and Science Education (Ranking Member)
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
** Subcommittee on Aviation
** Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
** Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment

===Caucus memberships===
* Co-chair of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) Ed Caucus
* Peak Oil Caucus

Ehlers served as chairman of the House Administration Committee in the 109th Congress after Bob Ney resigned from the position.

A portrait of Ehlers during his service as chairman of the Administration Committee is in the House collection.

==Political positions==
Ehlers was a moderate Republican. According to the &quot;National Journal,&quot; in 2006 his votes split 50-50 between &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative.&quot; While strongly anti-abortion and supportive of lowering taxes, he was willing to break with his party on environmental and government spending issues. He was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and Republicans for Environmental Protection. He was the only member of the Michigan Congressional delegation of either party to vote to raise fuel economy standards for automobiles in 2001 and 2005. 

Ehlers was a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006 he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Owing to his votes in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006, as well as his votes against hate crimes legislation and prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation, Ehlers was given a 0% rating by the Human Rights Campaign, indicating a voting record generally opposed to gay rights. However, in December 2010, Ehlers was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; ban on openly gay service members, and one of eight Republicans to vote for the DREAM Act.

==Political campaigns==
In 1993 Ehlers won a special election for the 3rd District, which had been vacant since Congressman Paul B. Henry died six months into his fifth term. He won a full term in 1994 and was re-elected six times with little significant Democratic opposition. Ehlers retired from Congress in 2010.

<text>In America is a 2002 drama film directed by Jim Sheridan. The semi-autobiographical screenplay by Jim Sheridan and his daughters, Naomi and Kirsten, focuses on an immigrant Irish family&#x27;s struggle to start a new life in New York City, as seen through the eyes of the elder daughter.

The film was an Irish, American and British co-production, and was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay for the Sheridans, Best Actress for Samantha Morton and Best Supporting Actor for Djimon Hounsou.

==Plot==
Johnny and Sarah Sullivan and their daughters Christy and Ariel enter the United States on a tourist visa from Ireland via Canada, where Johnny was working as an actor. The family settles in New York City, in a rundown Hell&#x27;s Kitchen walk-up tenement occupied by drug addicts, transvestites, and a reclusive Nigerian artist/photographer named Mateo Kuamey. Hanging over the family is the death of their five-year-old son Frankie, who died from a brain tumor discovered after a fall down the stairs. The devout Roman Catholic Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York.

After finding the apartment, Sarah gets a job in the local ice cream parlor to support the family while Johnny auditions for any role for which he is suited, with no success. Despite their poverty, the initial joy of being in the United States and the closeness of the family gives them the energy to make the most of what they have, and Christy chronicles the events of their life with a cherished camcorder. As money runs low and the city&#x27;s temperatures soar, the family dip into savings to go to the movies to see &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and buy a window air-conditioner to find respite from the oppressive weather. Johnny squanders large sums on a carnival target game, only to finally win the money back. Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant. Eventually Johnny finds work as a cab driver to augment their income and help pay for the girls&#x27; Catholic school tuition.

On Halloween, the girls become friendly with Mateo when they knock at his door to trick-or-treat. Despite Johnny&#x27;s reticence about the somewhat imposing and forbidding man, Sarah invites him to their apartment for dinner, and eventually they learn that the man is sad and lonely because he is dying of AIDS. Later, Mateo falls down a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious. Christy tries to resuscitate him using CPR, although she is warned away from him by the other residents, who seem to be aware that he is HIV-positive. The man&#x27;s condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah&#x27;s fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby&#x27;s survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby&#x27;s delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie&#x27;s death, and tearfully berate him.

However, after calming her down, Johnny and Sarah agree to the blood transfusion but without giving the baby &quot;bad blood,&quot; as using hospital blood banks was the source of Mateo&#x27;s contraction of HIV. Shortly, it is discovered that Christy has a compatible blood type to donate with, and Mateo&#x27;s death coincides with the first healthy movements of the infant following a blood transfusion from Christy. After the successful operation, the family is startled to learn that Mateo had settled and paid for their astronomical hospital bill before he had died, upon the discovery that Mateo was in possession of a large trust fund he never spent. They give the newborn baby girl the middle name of Mateo in gratitude and to honor his memory.

With the birth of the new baby and the death of Mateo, Johnny finally is able to overcome his lack of emotion and put his grieving for Frankie to rest. He also finally catches a break by getting a small role in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; on Broadway. The film ends after a baby shower at the apartment is held for the Sullivan family with many of the apartment tenants present to celebrate, and Christy and the rest of her family take in the view of the city and look out for Mateo in the night&#x27;s sky.

==Cast==
* Samantha Morton as Sarah Sullivan
* Paddy Considine as Johnny Sullivan
* Sarah Bolger as Christy Sullivan
* Emma Bolger as Ariel Sullivan

==Production==
The film is dedicated to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan&#x27;s brother Frankie, who died at the age of ten. In &quot;The Making of in America&quot;, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters—and co-writers—Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past.

Though the character of Mateo appears to be a signifier of the early AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Sheridan said it wasn&#x27;t his intention to set the film in the 1980s explicitly, saying, &quot;I didn’t want everybody from the art department running around changing the license plates on cars in New York. So I gave (Christy) a camcorder and shifted it into the &#x27;90s, but I kept the tone of the &#x27;80s, so I made it the recent past, like a mythological past, and that’s a lie, yeah. But it’s better than running around like an idiot getting factual truths&quot;.

Manhattan locations include Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Times Square, the Lincoln Tunnel, and 8th Street in the East Village.

Interiors were filmed at the Ardmore Studios in County Wicklow in Ireland. The fairground scene was filmed on Parnell Street, Dublin.

The soundtrack includes songs performed by The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Culture Club, The Corrs, The Byrds, Kid Creole and The Coconuts, Evan Olson, and The Langhorns.

==Release==
The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2003, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, the Boston Irish Film Festival, the Tribeca Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival, the Hamburg Film Festival, the Warsaw Film Festival, the Dinard Festival of British Cinema, and the Austin Film Festival.

===Box office===
The film opened in the UK on 31 October 2003, where it earned £284,259 on its opening weekend. It opened in limited release in the US on 26 November. It eventually grossed $15,539,656 in the US and $9,843,255 elsewhere, for a total worldwide box office of $25,382,911

===Critical reception===
Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 89%, based on 177 reviews, and an average rating of 7.75/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A rich and moving story about an immigrant family adjusting to life in New York&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott called it a &quot;modest, touching film&quot; and added, &quot;Many of [its] elements . . . seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim Sheridan&#x27;s graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, &quot;In America&quot; is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers . . . Mr. Sheridan is more interested in particular people than in general plights, and what lingers in the mind after you have seen his movies is the rough, radiant individuality of his characters . . . This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal. It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan&#x27;s other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed, &quot;&quot;In America&quot; is not unsentimental about its new arrivals (the movie has a warm heart and frankly wants to move us), but it is perceptive about the countless ways in which it is hard to be poor and a stranger in a new land.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Walter Addiego stated, &quot;I fought hard against the emotionalism of &quot;In America&quot; . . . but I lost. There&#x27;s no questioning the director&#x27;s ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants trying to make it in Manhattan. It got to me. I&#x27;m still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down — but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? . . . [He] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it&#x27;s best just to let yourself be swept away.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it &quot;forceful, funny and impassioned&quot; and &quot;an emotional wipeout&quot;.

In the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, Steve Persall graded the film A and added, &quot;This is a tearjerker for all the right reasons. Because it&#x27;s delicately manipulative and the characters are so precisely emotional. And because Sheridan&#x27;s manner with the material makes crying seem like a cleansing, an affirmation that something so simple and sweet can still move us . . . I loved this unassuming, heartfelt little gem, even if I couldn&#x27;t stop sobbing for an hour after the show. It&#x27;s just so beautiful.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;touching, but not cloying, uplifting and hopeful but never sappy and also just plain funny. There is not a false note among the five core performances, nor a false word in Sheridan&#x27;s script. &quot;In America&quot; is a classic story of losing and finding faith told with heart, humor and emotional heft.&quot;

In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French said, &quot;The movie lacks conviction from implausible beginning to sentimental end.&quot;

<text>In computer science, a mask or bitmask is data that is used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field. Using a mask, multiple bits in a byte, nibble, word, etc. can be set either on or off, or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation. An additional use of masking involves predication in vector processing, where the bitmask is used to select which element operations in the vector are to be executed (mask bit is enabled) and which are not (mask bit is clear).

==Common bitmask functions==

===Masking bits to codice_1===
To turn certain bits on, the bitwise codice_2 operation can be used, following the principle that for an individual bit Y, codice_3 and codice_4. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, codice_2 can be used with a codice_1. To leave a bit unchanged, codice_2 is used with a codice_8.

Example: Masking &quot;on&quot; the higher nibble (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) while leaving the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 
 10010101 10100101
 OR 11110000 11110000
 = 11110101 11110101

===Masking bits to codice_8===
More often in practice, bits are &quot;masked &quot;off&quot;&quot; (or masked to codice_8) than &quot;masked &quot;on&quot;&quot; (or masked to codice_1). When a bit is codice_12ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. codice_13. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be codice_12ed with codice_1 as codice_16 

Example: Masking &quot;off&quot; the higher nibble (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) while leaving the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 
 10010101 10100101
 AND 00001111 00001111
 = 00000101 00000101

===Querying the status of a bit===
It is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise codice_12 is done as discussed above and the value is compared with codice_8. If it is equal to codice_8, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not codice_8.

Example: Querying the status of the 4th bit
 10011101 10010101
 AND 00001000 00001000
 = 00001000 00000000

===Toggling bit values===
So far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the codice_21 (exclusive or) operation. codice_21 returns codice_1 if and only if an odd number of bits are codice_1. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are codice_1, the result will be a codice_8, but if only one of them is codice_1, the result will be codice_1. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by codice_21ing them with a codice_1. If the original bit was codice_1, it returns codice_32. If the original bit was codice_8 it returns codice_34. Also note that codice_21 masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because codice_36, just like an codice_2.

Example: Toggling bit values
 10011101 10010101
 XOR 00001111 11111111
 = 10010010 01101010

To write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:

 register = (register &amp; ~bitmask) | value;

==Uses of bitmasks==

=== Arguments to functions ===
In programming languages such as C, bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named Boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API OpenGL, there is a command, codice_38 which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and stencil buffers), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like
 glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code.
which is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, and codice_42 and codice_38 is declared as
 void glClear(GLbitfield bits);
Then a call to the function looks like this
 glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
Internally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary codice_44 to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of codice_38 might look like:

void glClear(GLbitfield bits) {
 if ((bits &amp; GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
 // Clear color buffer.
 if ((bits &amp; GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
 // Clear depth buffer.
 if ((bits &amp; GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
 // Clear accumulation buffer.
 if ((bits &amp; GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {
 // Clear stencil buffer.
}
The advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not type-safe. A codice_46 is simply defined to be an codice_47, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to codice_48 or even codice_49. In C++ an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library.

===Inverse masks===
Masks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address with a mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask . This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a wildcard mask. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A &quot;0&quot;-bit indicates that the address bit must be considered (exact match); a &quot;1&quot;-bit in the mask is a &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;. This table further explains the concept.

Mask example:

network address (traffic that is to be processed): 

mask: 

network address (binary): 11000000.00000000.00000010.00000000

mask (binary): 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111

Based on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets (octets) must match the given binary network address exactly (11000000.00000000.00000010). The last set of numbers is made of &quot;don&#x27;t cares&quot; (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with &quot;&quot; matches, since the last octet is &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;. Therefore, with this mask, network addresses through () are processed.

Subtract the normal mask from in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address with a normal mask of .

 − (normal mask) = (inverse mask)

ACL equivalents

The source/source-wildcard of means &quot;any&quot;.

The source/wildcard of is the same as &quot;host &quot;

===Image masks===
In computer graphics, when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two bitmaps: the actual image, in which the unused areas are given a pixel value with all bits set to 0s, and an additional &quot;mask&quot;, in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.

At run time, to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel&#x27;s bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the bitwise AND operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.

Then, the program renders the image pixel&#x27;s bits by combining them with the background pixel&#x27;s bits using the bitwise OR operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.

This technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the sprites), for GUI icons, and for video titling and other image mixing applications. A faster method is to simply overwrite the background pixels with the foreground pixels if their alpha=1

Although related (due to being used for the same purposes), transparent colors and alpha channels are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.

===Hash tables===
To create a hashing function for a hash table, often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.

An example of both modulo and masking in C:
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF; // 2^32 - 1
 const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1«10; // 2^10
 const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF; // (2^10)-1

 char **token_array = NULL;
 // Handle memory allocation for token_array…

 char token[] = &quot;some hashable value&quot;;
 uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);

 // Using modulo
 size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;

 // OR

 // Using bitmask
 size_t index = hashed_token &amp; HASH_BITMASK;

 *(token_array+index) = token;

 // Free the memory from token_array …
 return 0;

<text>The Christic Institute was a public interest law firm founded in 1980 by Daniel Sheehan, his wife Sara Nelson, and their partner, William J. Davis, a Jesuit priest, after the successful conclusion of their work on the &quot;Silkwood&quot; case. Based on the ecumenical teachings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and on the lessons they learned from their experience in the Silkwood fight, the Christic Institute combined investigation, litigation, education and organizing into a unique model for social reform in the United States. In 1992 the firm lost its non-profit status after having a federal case dismissed by the court in 1988 and being penalized for filing a &quot;frivolous lawsuit&quot;. The IRS said that the Christic Institute had acted for political reasons. The case was related to journalists injured in relation to the Iran–Contra Affair. The group was succeeded by a new firm, the Romero Institute.

Christic notably represented victims of the nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island; they prosecuted KKK and American Nazi Party members for killing Communist Workers Party demonstrators in the 1979 Greensboro Massacre (they also charged certain police and federal agents who they said had known about potential violence and had not adequately protected the victims); and they defended Catholic workers providing sanctuary to Salvadoran refugees (American Sanctuary Movement). Its headquarters were in Washington, D.C., with offices in several other major United States cities. The Institute received funding from a nationwide network of grassroots donors, as well as organizations like the New World Foundation.

==Three Mile Island, Greensboro Massacre, American Sanctuary Movement==
In 1979, Daniel Sheehan, Sara Nelson and many of the allies and architects of the Silkwood case gathered in Washington, D.C. to found The Christic Institute. Over the next 12 years, as General Counsel for the Institute, Sheehan helped prosecute some of the most celebrated public interest cases of the time. Christic represented victims of the nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island.

They conducted a civil suit, seeking damages from KKK and American Nazi Party (ANP) members for the murder of five civil rights demonstrators in the Greensboro Massacre. In addition, they charged the city, certain police and four Federal agents with having known of the potential for violence and failing to protect the protesters. The jury awarded damages to the plaintiffs against the city, the police department, and the KKK and ANP.

The Institute defended Catholic workers providing sanctuary to Salvadoran refugees in the American Sanctuary Movement.

The graphic novel &quot;Brought to Light,&quot; by writers Alan Moore and Joyce Brabner, used material from lawsuits filed by the Christic Institute.

==&quot;Avirgan v. Hull&quot;==
In 1986, the Christic Institute filed a $24 million civil suit on behalf of journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey stating that various individuals were part of a conspiracy responsible for the La Penca bombing that injured Avirgan. The suit charged the defendants with illegally participating in assassinations, as well as arms and drug trafficking. Among the 30 defendants named were Iran–Contra figures John K. Singlaub, Richard V. Secord, Albert Hakim, and Robert W. Owen; Central Intelligence Agency officials Thomas Clines and Theodore Shackley; Contra leader Adolfo Calero; Medellin cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez; Costa Rican rancher John Hull; and former mercenary Sam N. Hall.

On June 23, 1988, United States federal judge James Lawrence King of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the case stating: &quot;The plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at La Penca, the threats made to their news sources or threats made to themselves.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the case was dismissed by King at least in part due to &quot;the fact that the vast majority of the 79 witnesses Mr. Sheehan cites as authorities were either dead, unwilling to testify, fountains of contradictory information or at best one person removed from the facts they were describing.&quot; On February 3, 1989, King ordered the Christic Institute to pay $955,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees and $79,500 in court costs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the ruling, and the Supreme Court of the United States let the judgment stand by refusing to hear an additional appeal. The fine was levied in accordance with “Rule 11” of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which says that lawyers can be penalized for frivolous lawsuits.

On November 16 and 17, 1990, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne performed a benefit concert for the Christic Institute at the Shrine Auditorium while the case was on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit.

In the wake of the dismissal, Christic attorneys and Honey and Avirgan traded accusations over who was to blame for the failure of the case. Avirgan complained that Sheehan had handled matters poorly by chasing unsubstantiated &quot;wild allegations&quot; and conspiracy theories, rather than paying attention to core factual issues.

The Christic Institute was succeeded by the Romero Institute.

Hounsou made his directorial debut with the documentary film &quot;In Search of Voodoo: Roots to Heaven&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Hounsou was born in Cotonou, Benin, to Albertine and Pierre Hounsou. He immigrated to Lyon in France at the age of 12 with his brother Edmond. Soon after arriving there, he dropped out of school and was homeless for a time. A chance meeting with a photographer led to an introduction to fashion designer Thierry Mugler, who encouraged Hounsou to pursue a modelling career. In 1987, he became a model and established a career in Paris. He was found at Porte de Clichy. He moved to the United States in 1990.

==Career==
===Acting===

Between 1989 and 1991, Hounsou appeared in the music videos for &quot;Straight Up&quot; by Paula Abdul, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You&quot; by Tina Turner, &quot;Love Will Never Do (Without You)&quot; by Janet Jackson and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. He also appears in En Vogue&#x27;s music video for &quot;Hold On&quot;.

Hounsou&#x27;s film debut was in the 1990 Sandra Bernhard film &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot;. He had television parts on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;ER&quot; and a guest starring role on &quot;Alias&quot;. He had a larger role in the science fiction film &quot;Stargate&quot;.

Hounsou received wide critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award nomination for his role as Cinqué in the 1997 Steven Spielberg film &quot;Amistad&quot; and gained further notice as Juba in the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;. In 2004, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;In America&quot;, making him the fourth African male to be nominated for an Oscar. In 2005, he played a mercenary in the movie &quot;The Island&quot; alongside Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. In 2006, he won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; and received Broadcast Film Critics Association, Screen Actors Guild Award and Academy Award nominations for this performance.

Hounsou had a supporting role in the 2009 science-fiction film &quot;Push&quot;, as Agent Henry Carver. In 2011, he starred as a French commando in the French film &quot;Forces spéciales&quot;.

Director Tim Story told IGN that if he had done a third &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; film, he would have liked Hounsou to portray Black Panther. In November 2008, it was announced that Hounsou would provide the voice of Black Panther in the television series of the same name. He had signed on to play Abdiel in the film version of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; with Benjamin Walker and Bradley Cooper, but the film was scrapped in early February 2012.

In 2013, he appeared in the comedy film &quot;Baggage Claim&quot; alongside Paula Patton. He also voiced Drago Blodfist in &quot;How to Train Your Dragon 2&quot; and portrayed Korath the Pursuer in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, both in 2014. He played villains in two 2015 films: &quot;Seventh Son&quot; and &quot;Furious 7&quot;, the latter being the seventh installment of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; franchise.

In February 2016, it was reported that Hounsou would join the second season of the television series &quot;Wayward Pines&quot;. Also in 2016, he played Chief Mbonga in &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot;.

In 2018, Hounsou joined the DC Extended Universe, voicing the Fisherman King Ricou in &quot;Aquaman&quot; (with the character motion-captured by Andrew Crawford). He then replaced Ron Cephas Jones as the Wizard Shazam in &quot;Shazam!&quot; (2019). He reprised his role in &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022) and &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; (2023). Also in 2019, he reprised his role as Korath in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and then in the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;.

In November 2022, it was announced that Honsou had joined the cast of the film&quot; based on the Gran Turismo&quot; video game, with Geri Halliwell playing his wife.

In January 2025, Hounsou claimed that, throughout his career, he has encountered challenges like those experienced by other Black actors in Hollywood, including being typecast, and claimed he&#x27;s been always getting &quot;unfair compensation.&quot; He blamed systemic racism for this predicament, saying that, despite having been twice nominated for an Academy Award, he is still &quot;struggling financially to make a living.&quot;

===Modeling===
On 24 February 2007, it was announced that Hounsou would be the new Calvin Klein underwear model. At the time, he was represented by Los Angeles modeling agent Omar Albertto.

===Other work===
In 2010, Hounsou was featured as the narrator in ESPN&#x27;s series of &quot;32 Teams, 1 Dream&quot; commercials for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He spoke at the Summit on Climate Change at the United Nations on 22 September 2009. On 1 December 2009, he told French media that developed countries &quot;need to be held accountable&quot; for their contribution to climate change.

In 2018, Hounsou made his directorial debut with the documentary film &quot;In Search of Voodoo: Roots to Heaven&quot;, which examines the history, nature and religious practices of West African Vodun. The documentary premiered at the Miami International Film Festival on 10 March 2018.

In 2024, Hounsou had a guest performance on South African record producer and DJ Black Coffee&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Ancestors&quot; song which was included in an EP inspired by Zack Snyder&#x27;s movie, &quot;Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Hounsou began dating model Kimora Lee Simmons. Hounsou and Simmons visited Hounsou&#x27;s family in his native Benin in the summer of 2008, where the two participated in a traditional commitment ceremony. They were adorned in traditional clothing and used the ceremony, in the presence of Hounsou&#x27;s family, to confirm that they were &quot;dedicated to each other 100%&quot;, although they emphasized the ceremony was not a wedding. In the début of Kimora Lee Simmons&#x27; show &quot;&quot;, he was billed as her husband. In 2009, Simmons gave birth to their son. Hounsou and Simmons, who were never legally married in the United States, announced their separation in November 2012.

<text>Demetrios Ypsilantis (alternatively spelled Demetrius Ypsilanti; , ; , ; 179316 August 1832) was a Greek army officer who served in both the Hellenic Army and the Imperial Russian Army. Ypsilantis played an important role in the Greek War of Independence, leading several key battles. He was also member of the Filiki Eteria and the younger brother of Alexander Ypsilantis.

==Early life==
A member of Phanariote noble Ypsilantis family, he was the second son of Prince Constantine Ypsilantis of Moldavia and Elisavet Ypsilanti. He was sent to France where he was educated at a French military school.

==Union of Moldavia and Wallachia==
He distinguished himself as a Russian officer in the campaign of 1814.

In 1821 he took part in the Wallachian uprising under the leadership of his brother Alexandros, that indirectly benefited the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia.

==The Greek War of Independence==
After the failure of the uprising in Wallachia, he went to the Morea (Peloponessus), where the Greek War of Independence had just broken out, as representative of Filiki Etaireia and his brother.

He was one of the most conspicuous of the Phanariote leaders during the early stages of the revolt, though he was much hampered by the local chiefs and by the civilian element headed by Alexandros Mavrokordatos; as a result the organisation of a regular army was slowed and operations were limited. He took part in the sieges of Tripolitsa, Nafplion and the Battle of Dervenakia, securing the Greek dominion in Morea.

On 15 January 1822, he was elected president of the legislative assembly. However, due to the failure of his campaign in central Greece, and his failure to obtain a commanding position in the national convention of Astros, he was compelled to retire in 1823. After the landing of Ibrahim at Morea, he took part in the defence of Naplion in the Battle of the Lerna Mills.

In 1828, he was appointed in the new established regular army by Ioannis Kapodistrias as commander of the troops in eastern Greece. On 25 September 1829, he successfully compelled Aslan Bey to capitulate at the Pass of Petra (Battle of Petra), thus ending the active operations of the war.

==Personal life==
He was known for an affair with Manto Mavrogenous, who was a Greek heroine of the Greek War of Independence.

==Death==

He died due to illness in Nafplion on 16 August 1832.

==Legacy==
*The city of Ypsilanti, Michigan, US; founded in 1823, during the Greek struggle for independence; is named after him. A bust of Demetrios Ypsilanti stands between American and Greek flags at the base of the landmark Ypsilanti Water Tower.
* Ypsilanti, North Dakota, US, was named by a person from Ypsilanti, Michigan, and is thus also indirectly named after Demetrios Ypsilantis.
*Ypsilanti in Talbot County, Georgia, US, was once a relatively important cotton growing centre but “is now (2010) merely a crossroads with a reported five residences.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, the Nagell–Lutz theorem is a result in the diophantine geometry of elliptic curves, which describes rational torsion points on elliptic curves over the integers.
It is named for Trygve Nagell and Élisabeth Lutz.

==Definition of the terms==
Suppose that the equation

:formula_1

defines a non-singular cubic curve with integer coefficients &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and let &quot;D&quot; be the discriminant of the cubic polynomial on the right side:

:formula_2

==Statement of the theorem==

If &quot;P&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) is a rational point of finite order on &quot;C&quot;, for the elliptic curve group law, then:
*1) &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are integers
*2) either &quot;y&quot; = 0, in which case &quot;P&quot; has order two, or else &quot;y&quot; divides &quot;D&quot;, which immediately implies that &quot;y&quot;2 divides &quot;D&quot;.

==Generalizations==

The Nagell–Lutz theorem generalizes to arbitrary number fields and more
general cubic equations. 
For curves over the rationals, the
generalization says that, for a nonsingular cubic curve 
whose Weierstrass form
:formula_3
has integer coefficients, any rational point &quot;P&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of finite
order must have integer coordinates, or else have order 2 and
coordinates of the form &quot;x&quot;=&quot;m&quot;/4, &quot;y&quot;=&quot;n&quot;/8, for &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; integers.

==History==
The result is named for its two independent discoverers, the Norwegian Trygve Nagell (1895–1988) who published it in 1935, and Élisabeth Lutz (1937).

<text>A cap is a flat headgear, usually with a visor. Caps have crowns that fit very close to the head. They made their first appearance as early as 3200 BC. The origin of the word &quot;cap&quot; comes from the Old French word &quot;chapeau&quot; which means &quot;head covering&quot;. Over time, the word has evolved and changed its meaning, but it still retains its association with headwear. Caps typically have a visor, or no brim at all. They are popular in casual and informal settings, and are seen in sports and fashion. They are typically designed for warmth, and often incorporate a visor to block sunlight from the eyes. They come in many shapes, sizes, and are of different brands. Baseball caps are one of the most common types of cap.

== Present day depictions of caps ==

Caps might have started off as a way to keep people shaded from the sun, but now they are much more than that. Caps have been made a staple in both the sports and fashion industries, one leading into the other.

=== Sports ===
As stated earlier, caps are typically designed with a visor which makes it perfect for keeping a person cool from the heat and sheltering a person&#x27;s eyes from the sun, so it was a matter of time before they made it to the sports industry. The first sport to adopt wearing caps was baseball, the hats were made out of straw and were worn on April 24, 1849, by the New York Knickerbockers. However, within a few years time the team began to wear a cap made of fine merino wool, that featured a crown and an attached visor. This design became the prototype for caps of that time and still the most popular in present day. It&#x27;s also not the only design for baseball hats but other sports as well, such as cricket, golf and tennis.

=== Fashion ===
Sportswear found its way to fashion in the nineteenth century and on the contrary to what many believe it began to actually cater to the wants and needs of women. Sports cap however made an impact on the fashion industry around the 1980s when the company New Era, who had been designing hats for sports teams, began designing and selling hats to the general public. Baseball caps, fitted caps, snapback caps and truckers hats would then be seen in music videos, films, runways and even on Princess Diana&#x27;s head, which helped nurture her appearance as the &quot;people&#x27;s princess.&quot; Along with hats, sports jerseys also became available in the 1980s as well, and now licensed apparel is a multi-billion dollar industry.

<text>21 Grams is a 2003 American crime thriller film co-produced and directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and written by Guillermo Arriaga. The film stars Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Danny Huston and Benicio Del Toro. The second part of Arriaga&#x27;s and Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy of Death&quot;, preceded by &quot;Amores perros&quot; (2000) and followed by &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), &quot;21 Grams&quot; interweaves several plot lines in a nonlinear arrangement.

The film&#x27;s plot is about the consequences of a tragic hit-and-run accident. Penn plays a critically ill mathematician, Watts plays a grief-stricken mother, and Del Toro plays a born-again Christian ex-convict whose faith is sorely tested in the aftermath of the accident. The three main characters each have &quot;past&quot;, &quot;present&quot; and &quot;future&quot; story threads, which are shown as non-linear fragments that punctuate elements of the overall story, all imminently coming toward each other and coalescing as the story progresses. Critics gave the film generally favorable reviews, praising Iñárritu&#x27;s direction, Arriaga&#x27;s screenplay, and Watts&#x27; and Del Toro&#x27;s performances. &quot;21 Grams&quot; made $60.4 million at the box office on a $20 million budget. Watts and Del Toro were nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor at the 76th Academy Awards.

== Plot ==
The story is told in a nonlinear manner. The following is a chronological summary of the plot:

Jack Jordan is a former convict who is using his new-found religious faith to recover from drug addiction and alcoholism. Paul Rivers is a mathematics professor with a dedicated wife, Mary, and has a fatal heart condition. Unless he receives a new heart from an organ donor, he will not live longer than a month. Mary wants him to donate his sperm so she can have his baby even if he dies. Cristina Peck is a recovering drug addict and now lives a normal suburban life with a supportive husband and two children. She is a loving mother and active swimmer who has left behind her days of drugs and alcohol. These three separate stories/characters become tied together one evening when Jack kills Cristina&#x27;s husband and children in a hit-and-run accident. Cristina&#x27;s husband&#x27;s heart is donated to Paul, who begins his recovery.

Cristina is devastated by the loss and returns to drugs and alcohol. Paul is eager to begin normal life again, but he hesitantly agrees to his wife&#x27;s idea of artificial insemination as a last-ditch effort to get pregnant. During consultations with a doctor before the procedure, Paul learns about an abortion that Mary had undergone after they had separated in the past. Angered, Paul ends the relationship. He becomes very inquisitive about whose heart he has. He learns from a private detective that the heart belonged to Cristina&#x27;s husband and begins to follow the widowed Cristina around town.

Jack is stricken with guilt following the accident and starts using drugs again. Despite his wife&#x27;s protests to keep quiet and conceal his guilt, Jack tells her that his &quot;duty is to God&quot; and turns himself in. While incarcerated, he clashes verbally with a pastor who had helped him after his last incarceration, claims that God had betrayed him, loses his will to live, and attempts suicide. He is released after Cristina declines to press charges against him, as she realizes that incarcerating Jack will not bring her family back. When Jack is released, he is unable to reincorporate himself into normal family life, and instead leaves home to live as a transient, working as a manual laborer.

Paul finds an opportunity to meet Cristina and eventually reveals how the two of them are connected. She is initially furious and forces him out, but soon reconsiders. Desperately needing each other, they continue their relationship. Though Paul has a new heart, his body is rejecting the transplant and his outlook is grim. As Cristina begins to dwell more on her changed life and the death of her family, she becomes obsessed with taking revenge against Jack. She goads Paul into agreeing to murder him.

Paul meets with the private detective who had found Cristina for him. The detective tells Paul that Jack is living in a motel and sells Paul a gun. Paul and Cristina check into the motel where Jack is staying. When Jack is walking alone, Paul grabs him and leads him out into a clearing at gunpoint intending to kill him. However, Paul is unable to kill Jack, who himself is confused, shaking and pleading during the event. Paul fires three shots into the ground and tells Jack to &quot;just disappear,&quot; then returns to the motel and lies to Cristina about Jack&#x27;s death. Later that night, while they are sleeping, Paul and Cristina are awakened by a noise outside their door. It&#x27;s Jack, who, still consumed by guilt, orders Paul to actually kill him and end his misery. A struggle ensues, during which Cristina blind-sides Jack and starts beating him with a wooden lamp. Paul collapses, gets hold of the gun, and accidentally shoots himself.

Jack and Cristina rush Paul to the hospital. Still believing he deserves to be punished for his hit-and-run, Jack tells the police that he was the one who shot Paul, but is released when his story cannot be confirmed. Paul dies, and the conflict between Cristina and Jack remains unresolved (they meet in the waiting room after Paul&#x27;s death; if they have a conversation, it is not shown). When Cristina offers to donate blood for Paul in the hospital, she learns that she is pregnant; the doctor urges Cristina to quit using drugs. After Paul&#x27;s death, Cristina is seen tentatively preparing for the new child in one of her daughter&#x27;s bedrooms, which she had previously been unable to enter after her daughter&#x27;s death. Jack is shown returning to his family.

== Cinematic technique ==
The distinctive stylistic elements of the film&#x27;s cinematography are its gritty, hand-held shots, the extensive use of the bleach bypass process, and the use of color casts. All these techniques were used to distinguish each character&#x27;s storyline, to describe the development of the stories, and to mark changes in the character&#x27;s life balance. Given the non-linear presentation of the events and the interweaving of the three narratives, these elements serve as visual hints to help the viewer collocate the events chronologically. In an interview on American Cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto pointed out that &quot;there were cues [in the script] to help you understand where you were in the chronology of each story, but I felt we should [have supported] that visually.&quot;

Paul&#x27;s story is pictured with cool colors, Jack&#x27;s story uses warm colors, and Cristina&#x27;s story is presented neutrally. In addition, the stories were shot with different film stocks to obtain different grain structures through their progression: &quot;when things were looking up for the characters, we&#x27;d use a finer-grained stock&quot;, while &quot;as things get more complex, we go to a heavier grain&quot;, explained Prieto. Thorough experimentation had been necessary to understand how to achieve the desired effects with color palettes, lighting and wardrobe, and how each of these elements interacted with the bleach bypass process. &quot;We kept making tests, and we arrived at the final scheme through discovery, not design ... We couldn&#x27;t take anything for granted—we were surprised by the test results every time!&quot; recalled Prieto.

Both Iñárritu and Prieto wanted to accomplish a spontaneous, instinctive, yet transparent camerawork &quot;to create the feeling that the camera was present with the actors, moving, reacting and breathing with them&quot;. Handheld camera was always used, even on static shots. Camerawork becomes more unstable and frame composition becomes deliberately unbalanced to reflect the character&#x27;s life steadiness: &quot;sometimes we wanted to have too much or too little headroom in the frame&quot;, explained Prieto. In their most difficult moments, characters are depicted in wide shots and placed in the corners of the frame to appear small and lonely. Prieto refers to these shots as &quot;abandoning angles&quot;.

== Title ==
The title refers to an experiment in 1907 which attempted to show scientific proof of the existence of the soul by recording a loss of body weight (said to represent the departure of the soul) immediately following death. Referred to as the 21 grams experiment as one subject lost &quot;three-fourths of an ounce&quot; (21.3 grams), the experiment is regarded by the scientific community as flawed and unreliable, though it has been credited with popularizing the concept that the soul weighs 21 grams.

<text>A top hat (also called a high hat, or, informally, a topper) is a tall, flat-crowned hat traditionally associated with formal wear in Western dress codes, meaning white tie, morning dress, or frock coat. Traditionally made of black silk or sometimes grey, the top hat emerged in Western fashion by the end of the 18th century. Although it declined by the time of the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains a formal fashion accessory. A collapsible variant of a top hat, developed in the 19th century, is known as an opera hat.

Perhaps inspired by the early modern era capotain, higher-crowned dark felt hats with wide brims emerged as a country leisurewear fashion along with the Age of Revolution around the 1770s. Around the 1780s, the justaucorps was replaced by the previously casual frocks and dress coats. At the same time, the tricorne and bicorne hats were replaced by what became known as the top hat. By the 1790s, the directoire style dress coat with top hat was widely introduced as citywear for the upper and middle classes in all urban areas of the Western world. The justaucorps was replaced in all but the most formal court affairs. Around the turn of the 19th century, although for a few decades beaver hats were popular, black silk became the standard, sometimes varied by grey ones. While the dress coats were replaced by the frock coat from the 1840s as conventional formal daywear, top hats continued to be worn with frock coats as well as with what became known as formal evening wear white tie. Towards the end of the 19th century, whereas the white tie with black dress coat remained fixed, frock coats were gradually replaced by morning dress, along with top hats.

After World War I, the 1920s saw widespread introduction of semi-formal black tie and informal wear suits that were worn with less formal hats such as bowler hats, homburgs, boaters and fedoras respectively, in established society. After World War II, white tie, morning dress and frock coats along with their counterpart, the top hat, started to become confined to high society, politics and international diplomacy. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, its use declined further along with the disuse also of daily informal hats by men.

Yet, along with traditional formal wear, the top hat continues to be applicable for the most formal occasions, including weddings and funerals, in addition to certain audiences, balls, and horse racing events, such as the Royal Enclosure at Royal Ascot and the Queen&#x27;s Stand of Epsom Derby. It also remains part of the formal dress of those occupying prominent positions in certain traditional British institutions, such as the Bank of England, certain City stock exchange officials, occasionally at the Law Courts and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, judges of the Chancery Division and King&#x27;s Counsel, boy-choristers of King&#x27;s College Choir, dressage horseback riders, and servants&#x27; or doormen&#x27;s livery.

As part of traditional formal wear, in popular culture the top hat has sometimes been associated with the upper class, and used by satirists and social critics as a symbol of capitalism or the world of business, as with the Monopoly Man or Scrooge McDuck. The top hat also forms part of the traditional dress of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States, generally striped in red, white and blue. Furthermore, ever since the famous &quot;Pulling a Rabbit out of a Hat&quot; of Louis Comte in 1814, the top hat remains associated with hat tricks and stage magic costumes.

==Name==
The top hat is also known as a &quot;beaver hat&quot; or &quot;silk hat&quot;, in reference to its material, as well as casually as &quot;chimney pot hat&quot; or &quot;stove pipe hat&quot;.

== History ==

According to fashion historians, the top hat may have descended directly from the sugarloaf hat; otherwise it is difficult to establish provenance for its creation. Gentlemen began to replace the tricorne with the top hat at the end of the 18th century; a painting by Charles Vernet of 1796, &quot;Un Incroyable&quot;, shows a French dandy (one of the &quot;Incroyables et Merveilleuses&quot;) with such a hat. The first silk top hat in England is credited to George Dunnage, a hatter from Middlesex, in 1793. The invention of the top hat is often erroneously credited to a haberdasher named John Hetherington.

Within 30 years top hats had become popular with all social classes, with even workmen wearing them. At that time those worn by members of the upper classes were usually made of felted beaver fur; the generic name &quot;stuff hat&quot; was applied to hats made from various non-fur felts. The hats became part of the uniforms worn by policemen and postmen (to give them the appearance of authority); since these people spent most of their time outdoors, their hats were topped with black oilcloth.

===19th century===
Between the latter part of 18th century and the early part of the 19th century, felted beaver fur was slowly replaced by silk &quot;hatter&#x27;s plush&quot;, though the silk topper met with resistance from those who preferred the beaver hat.

The 1840s and the 1850s saw it reach its most extreme form, with ever-higher crowns and narrow brims. The &quot;stovepipe hat&quot; was a variety with mostly straight sides, while one with slightly convex sides was called the &quot;chimney pot&quot;. The style most commonly referred to as the stovepipe was popularized in the United States by Abraham Lincoln during his presidency; though it is postulated that he may never have called it stovepipe himself, but merely a silk hat or a plug hat. Lincoln often carried documents and letters inside the hat. One of Lincoln&#x27;s top hats is kept on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.

During the 19th century, the top hat developed from a fashion into a symbol of urban respectability, and this was assured when Prince Albert started wearing them in 1850; the rise in popularity of the silk plush top hat possibly led to a decline in beaver hats, sharply reducing the size of the beaver trapping industry in North America, though it is also postulated that the beaver numbers were also reducing at the same time. Whether it directly affected or was coincidental to the decline of the beaver trade is debatable.

James Laver once observed that an assemblage of &quot;toppers&quot; resembled factory chimneys and thus added to the mood of the industrial era. In England, post-Brummel dandies went in for flared crowns and swooping brims. Their counterparts in France, known as the &quot;Incroyables&quot;, wore top hats of such outlandish dimensions that there was no room for them in overcrowded cloakrooms until the invention of the collapsible top hat.

===20th century===

Until World War I the top hat was maintained as a standard item of formal outdoor wear by upper-class males for both daytime and evening usage. Considerations of convenience and expense meant however that it was increasingly superseded by soft hats for ordinary wear. By the end of World War II, it had become a comparative rarity, though it continued to be worn regularly in certain roles. In Britain these included holders of various positions in the Bank of England and City stockbroking, and boys at some public schools. All the civilian members of the Japanese delegation who signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945, wore top hats, reflecting common diplomatic practice at the time.

The top hat persisted in politics and international diplomacy for many years. In the Soviet Union, there was debate as to whether its diplomats should follow the international conventions and wear a top hat. Instead a diplomatic uniform with peaked cap for formal occasions was adopted. Top hats were part of formal wear for U.S. presidential inaugurations for many years. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spurned the hat for his inauguration, but John F. Kennedy, who was accustomed to formal dress, brought it back for his in 1961. Nevertheless, Kennedy delivered his forceful inaugural address hatless, reinforcing the image of vigor he desired to project, and setting the tone for an active administration to follow.

His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, did not wear a top hat for any part of his inauguration in 1965, and the hat has not been worn since for this purpose.

In the United Kingdom, the post of Government Broker in the London Stock Exchange that required the wearing of a top hat in the streets of the City of London was abolished by the &quot;Big Bang&quot; reforms of October 1986. In the British House of Commons, a rule requiring a Member of Parliament who wished to raise a point of order during a division, having to speak seated with a top hat on, was abolished in 1998. Spare top hats were kept in the chamber in case they were needed. The Modernisation Select Committee commented that &quot;This particular practice has almost certainly brought the House into greater ridicule than almost any other&quot;.

Although Eton College has long abandoned the top hat as part of its uniform, top hats are still worn by &quot;Monitors&quot; at Harrow School with their Sunday dress uniform. They are worn by male members of the British Royal Family on State occasions as an alternative to military uniform, for instance, in the Carriage Procession at the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Top hats may also be worn at some horse racing meetings, notably The Derby and Royal Ascot. Top hats are worn at the Tynwald Day ceremony and a few other formal occasions in the Isle of Man.

In George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot;, the top hat features prominently in the propaganda of the book&#x27;s totalitarian regime: &quot;These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces [...] dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it.&quot;

=== 21st century ===
The modern standard top hat is a hard, black silk hat, characteristically made of fur. The acceptable colors are much as they have traditionally been, with &quot;white&quot; hats (which are actually grey), a daytime racing color, worn at the less formal occasions demanding a top hat, such as Royal Ascot, or with a morning suit. In the U.S. top hats are worn widely in coaching, a driven horse discipline, as well as for formal riding to hounds.

The collapsible silk opera hat, or &quot;crush hat&quot;, is still worn on occasions, and black in color if worn with evening wear as part of white tie, and is still made by a few companies, of the traditional materials of satin or grosgrain silk. The other alternative hat for eveningwear is the normal hard shell.

In formal academic dress, the Finnish and Swedish doctoral hat is a variant of the top hat, and remains in use today.

American rock musician Tom Petty was known for wearing several types of top hats throughout his career and in his music videos such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More.&quot; The British-American musician Slash has sported a top hat since he was in Guns N&#x27; Roses, a look that has become iconic for him. Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s Brendon Urie is also a frequent wearer of top hats. He has been known to wear them in previous live performances on their Nothing Rhymes with Circus tour and in the music videos, &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot; and &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot;.
The members of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; of the Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania Groundhog Club wear top hats on February 2 of every year when they perform the Groundhog Day ceremonies with Punxsutawney Phil.

Steampunk culture also incorporates the top hat into accepted headgear choices, though top hats worn in such a context are sometimes made of leather or similar materials and, now and then, even have simulated gears or other adornments secured to them.

A top hat, frequently colored red, white and blue, or with stars and stripes similar to those on the American flag, is part of the regular costume of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States.

For satirists and political cartoonists, the top hat was a convenient symbol of the upper class, business and capitalism. A character wearing a top hat would be instantly recognized by the viewer as a member of the oligarchy. The character Rich Uncle Pennybags in the board game Monopoly wears a top hat. In addition, a top hat is one of the game&#x27;s tokens, used by players to mark their position as they progress around the board.

====Freemasonry====

In Freemasonry, as practiced in North American lodges, top hats are often associated with the position of Worshipful Master as he is the only member allowed the privilege of wearing a head covering to signify his leadership within the lodge. However, the Master is not obliged to wear a top hat, and can wear whatever type of hat he deems appropriate for the occasion. This is because there are varying degrees of formality in different Lodges, from formal wear to everyday dress. It is also common for a Worshipful Master to receive top-hat-related trinkets and gifts on either the day of his installation or as a going away present. In other countries, especially in certain systems in Germany, top hats are worn by all members of the lodge.

====Judaism====
In some synagogues, the president and honorary officers may wear a top hat on Shabbat or the great festivals. The custom of wearing a top hat, or &quot;tzylinder&quot; in the Yiddish language, originated in 19th-century England, replacing the wig and tricorn hat. The custom became widespread in Europe until The Holocaust. In some traditional Sephardi synagogues, members of the congregation may also wear top hats on special occasions. The custom is said to have started at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London on a hot day, when the &quot;Chazzan&quot; was preparing for a service and decided that it was too hot to wear his wig, throwing it out of the window in a fit of bad temper. He then found that his tricorn hat was too big, as it had been made to fit over the wig, and so wore his top hat instead.

== Description ==
A silk top hat is made from hatters&#x27; plush, a soft silk weave with a very long, defined nap. This is rare now, because it has not been in general production since the 1950s, and it is thought that there are no looms capable of producing the traditional material any more; the last looms in Lyon were destroyed by the last owner, Nicholas Smith, after a violent breakup with his brother, Bobby Smith. The standard covering is now fur plush or &quot;melusine&quot; as (the London hat merchant) Christys&#x27; calls it. A grey flat fur felt top hat is the popular alternative.
It is common to see top hats in stiff wool felt and even soft wool though these are not considered on the same level as the silk or fur plush or grey felt varieties. The standard crown shape nowadays is the &#x27;semi-bell crown&#x27;; &#x27;full bell crowns&#x27; and &#x27;stovepipe&#x27; shaped toppers are rarer.

Because of the rarity of vintage silk hats, and the expense of modern top hats, the vintage/antique market is very lively, with models in wearable condition typically hard to find; price often varies with size (larger sizes are typically more expensive) and condition.

===Construction===
In the past, top hats were made by blocking a single piece of wool or fur felt and then covering the shell with fur plush. Since the invention of silk plush a new method using &quot;gossamer&quot; was invented and used up to the present day though the older method is more common for toppers made today.

A town-weight silk top hat is made by first blocking two pieces of gossamer (or &quot;goss&quot; for short), which is made of a sheet of cheesecloth that has been coated with a shellac and ammonia solution and left to cure for 5 months on a wooden frame, on a wooden top hat block (which is made of several interconnecting pieces like a puzzle so the block can be removed from the shell, as the opening is narrower than tip of the crown) to form the shell. After the shell has rested for a week in the block, the block is removed and the brim (made of several layers of goss to give it strength) is attached to the crown. The shell is coated with a layer of shellac varnish and also left for a further week. The silk plush is then cut to the correct pattern. The top and side pieces are sewn together; the side piece having an open diagonal seam. It is then eased over the shell carefully and then ironed (the heat of the iron melting the shellac for the plush to stick to it). The upper brim is also covered with a piece of silk plush or with silk petersham (a ribbed silk). The underbrim is covered with merino cloth. After the hat has fully rested, the brim is curled and bound with silk grosgrain ribbon, and a hat band (either silk grosgrain with or without a bow, or a black wool mourning band without a bow) is installed. Finally, the lining and the leather sweatband are carefully hand-stitched in.

The construction can vary; reinforced toppers sometimes called &quot;country-weight&quot; included greater layers of goss used to provide a strengthened hat that was traditionally suitable for riding and hunting, though it may not always conform to modern safety standards.

==Opera hat==

On May 5, 1812, a London hatter, Thomas Francis Dollman, patented a design for &quot;an elastic round hat&quot; supported by ribs and springs. His patent was described as:

Some sources have taken this to describe an early folding top hat, although it is not explicitly stated whether Dollman&#x27;s design was specifically for male or female headgear. Dollman&#x27;s patent expired in 1825. In France, around 1840, Antoine Gibus&#x27;s design for a spring-loaded collapsible top-hat proved so popular that hats made to it became known as &quot;&quot;. They were also often called &quot;opera hats&quot;, owing to the common practice of storing them in their flattened state under one&#x27;s seat at the opera. The characteristic snapping sound heard upon opening a gibus suggested a third name, the , .

<doc id="468337" wikidata="Q7069996" url="?curid=468337" title="Zikrism">
<text>Zikrism (also Zikriyya) is a Mahdist Shia minority Muslim group or sect found primarily in the Balochistan region of western Pakistan. The name Zikri comes from the Arabic word Dhikr.

Like Shia and Sunni Muslims, Zikri revere the Quran. However, they follow different prayer practices and believe the Mahdi (the messiah figure and Final Leader in Islamic eschatology who is believed to appear at the end of times to rid the world of evil and injustice) has already come. 

They already suffered sectarian attacks before the founding of Pakistan and more recent attacks and insecurity episodes have led some of them to migrate from Balochistan to Pakistan&#x27;s cities.

Their population is estimated to be somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000 individuals. 

== Origins and beliefs==
The Zikri faith developed in Makran in the late 16th-century.

Zikris believe in a Mahdi figure known as &quot;Nur Pak&quot;, or &quot;Pure Light.&quot; Zikris believe Nur Pak walked the earth before Adam and will return at the end of days to restore true Islam which has been perverted by the Sunnis. Some Zikris believe the founder of their sect to be a certain Mullah Attocki, who came from Attock in Punjab and propagated the faith in Makran, although others dispute it. According to Stephen Blake, an Afghan named Mulla Muhammad declared himself Mahdi and formed the Zikri movement which faced persecution from the Mughal authorities. By the 18th-century, Zikrism virtually achieved the status of state religion in Southern Balochistan.

A number of sources talk about how Sayyid Muhammad Jaunpuri is believed to be or thought to be by some, the founder of Zikrism. According to at least two scholars (Robert Benkin and Sabir Badalkhan), this cannot be true. Benkin writes that outside observers have claimed the Mahdi figure of the Balochi Zikris was Muhammad Jaunpuri, but Balochi Zikris deny that Muhammad Jaunpuri visited Balochistan and insist their Mahdi is a different figure from a later period. Zikris believe Nur Pak was born in 977 AH, or between 1569 and 1570 AD.

According to Sabir Badalkhan, the vast majority of Zikris, including their most influential leaders, reject the notion their Mahdi was Muhammad Jaunpuri, pointing to the different birth dates and deaths of Jaunpuri and their Mahdi, and that all Zikri sources record the Zikri Mahdi having died in Kech. They state their ancestors have never heard of Jaunpuri, and that there are no relations between Zikri and Mahdavi communities, and that their beliefs and practices are distinct.

== Practices ==
Zikris make a pilgrimage (&quot;Ziyarat&quot;) to &quot;Koh-e-Murad,&quot; &quot;Mountain of Desire&quot; in Balochi, on the 27th of Ramadan in commemoration of their Mahdi. They observe this day as a sacred holiday. The descendants of the original believers of the Mahdi continue to lead the Zikri community and are known as Murshids. Zikris refer to them as &quot;Waja&quot; as a form of respect. Early that morning, Zikris observe &quot;Shab-e-Qadr&quot;, the commemoration of Muhammad receiving his first revelation from the Angel Gabriel.

Zikris observe daily prayers called &quot;Zikr&quot; in place of &quot;Salah,&quot; the daily prayers of other Muslims. There are five daily Z&quot;ikrs&quot;. Three prayers are obligatory and performed in group orally. Two are silent and generally performed only by older and more devout Zikris. Women perform only the spoken &quot;Zikrs&quot;. The five prayers are known as &quot;Gwarbamay, Nemrochay, Rochzarday, Sarshapay&quot;, and &quot;Nemhangamay&quot;. &quot;Rochzarday&quot; and &quot;Nemhangamay&quot; may be performed individually, with all others being said in a group.

Zikri places of worship are called &quot;Zikr Khanas&quot; or &quot;Zigrāna&quot; (lit. &quot;House of Zikr&quot;). Zikris gather at three times a day at &quot;Zikr Khanas&quot; and perform a special prayer in a square formation with the leader in the middle. This prayer consists of formulae in Persian and Balochi, Quranic verses, and the repetition of God&#x27;s name while standing, sitting, and prostrating. Zikri worshippers wear white or light-colored clothing, wash before participating, and cover their head with a scarf or handkerchief called a rumal. Non-Zikris are forbidden to attend Zikri worship services at the &quot;Zikr Khana&quot;. &quot;Zikr Khanas&quot; were often built on &quot;Astanas&quot;, places deemed holy by the Zikri community. This could be a place a &quot;Murshid&quot; meditated or the former home of a community leader. Unlike Mosques, Zikr Khanas have no Mihrab (there is no need to mark the direction of prayer because God is everywhere), nor Minarets.

Contrary to some popular beliefs, Zikri do not have a different holy book than the Quran or in addition to the Quran. According to Sabir Badalkhan, they keep copies of the Quran (&quot;printed by Sunni Muslim printing presses in major Pakistan cities&quot;) in &quot;Zikr Khanas&quot; on shelves or in niches, &quot;usually wrapped in clean costly cloth&quot; and are treated with customary reverence, being kissed by Zikris after recitation of a verse.

On special occasions, Zikris observe &quot;Chaugan&quot;, songs of praise for Muhammad, the Mahdi, Turbat and Koh-i-Murad, accompanied by ritual dance-like movements. Members stay up all night performing devotions. A female reciter known as the &quot;Shehr&quot; stands in the middle of the formation reciting devotions to which the male group calls back.

&quot;Chaugans&quot; are sung in celebration of religious events such as the 27th of Ramadan, &quot;Shab-i-Barat&quot; (the 15th day of Sha&#x27;ban), and Eid al-Adha. Zikris believe the fourteenth day of the lunar month, if it falls on a Friday, to be auspicious, and may perform the &quot;Chaugan&quot; then.

== Persecution ==
Zikris have faced persecution from other Muslims for their beliefs.

Zikris faced persecution in the eighteenth century under the rule of Mir Nasir Khan the Great, the Sunni Muslim ruler of the Khanate of Kalat. Their religious and historical records were destroyed and surviving information was carried on by oral tradition and non-Zikri writings. Nasir Khan waged a war to convert Zikris to Sunni Islam, killing 35,000 Zikris, in a period known as the Zikri-Namazi war. Sunni Islam became the dominant religion in Balochistan with modern Zikris living in more remote areas.

In the 1930s, in Iranian Makran, an extremist called Qazi Abdullah Sarbazi declared jihad against Zikris, &quot;which resulted in a major massacre&quot; and the driving out of Zikri from that area. Also in that era, &quot;hundreds of other Zikris were killed&quot; in periodic pogroms by &quot;fanatic Sunnis at the instigation&quot; of their religious leaders &quot;in the areas of Farod, Baftan and Kishkaur (in Balochistan), according to Abdul Ghani Baloch.

After the establishment of Pakistan, Sunni Muslims attacked Zikris and subjected them to forced conversions. With the general rise of Islamic extremism and jihadism in the region since the 1980s, Zikris have been discriminated against, targeted, and killed by Sunni militants in Pakistan. Under the military government of Zia-al-Haqq, Sunnis sought to have Zikris declared as non-Muslims. In the 1990s, Zikris were harassed, and protestors called for the destruction of their shrines.

The persecution of Zikris by Sunni militants as of 2014 has been part of the larger backlash against religious minorities in Pakistani Balochistan, targeting Hindus, Hazaras, Shias, and Zikris, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 Shias, Zikris, and Hindus from Pakistani Balochistan. The militant groups Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Pakistani Taliban were responsible.

During the 1990s, there was a movement among Sunnis to declare Zikris non-Muslim, and a campaign was mounted against their annual congregation at Koh-i-Murad in Malakand. This was accompanied by demonstrations calling for the destruction of the Zikri Baitullah (House of God), and members of the sect were subjected to violence and harassment.

An attack occurred August 29, 2014, on a shrine in the Awaran district of Pakistan. Gunmen killed at least six Zikris and wounded seven others. On October 7, 2016, a gunman shot a Zikri religious leader dead in the Kech district of Balochistan. In August 2017, two Zikri pilgrims were killed and two were wounded when a bomb detonated in the Kamp Tal area of Pangjur, Balochistan.

== Population ==

The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2004 stated that there were approximately 200,000 Zikris. Victoria Williams estimates the number of Zikris at 800,000 Zikris, and Sabir Badalkhan at around 600,000 to 700,000.

Zikris live primarily in Pakistani Balochistan, concentrated in the southern coast of Makran, the Lasbela District, and Quetta. They are a majority in the Gwadar District of Makran in Balochistan. There are sizable communities of Zikris in Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province and Karachi, especially in the economically disadvantaged Lyari Town. While Zikris also historically lived in the province of Iranian Balochistan, almost all of them left for Pakistani Balochistan in the last decades of the 20th-century. Some Zikris have migrated from Pakistan to the peninsula of the Arabian Gulf where most live in the Sultanate of Oman.

Persecution has driven hundreds of Zikri and other minorities from Balochistan to safer cities in Pakistan like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad.

Pakistani Balochistan has a population of people of African descent from slavery. In the Makran region, many of these Afro-Balochi&#x27;s follow the Zikri sect.

<text>The Cooler is a 2003 American crime drama film directed by Wayne Kramer, from a screenplay by Frank Hannah and Kramer. The film stars William H. Macy, Maria Bello, Shawn Hatosy, Ron Livingston, Estella Warren, Paul Sorvino, and Alec Baldwin. It follows a casino &quot;cooler&quot; whose mere presence at the gambling tables usually results in a streak of bad luck for the other players.

&quot;The Cooler&quot; had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2003, and was released in limited theaters in the United States by Lions Gate Films on November 26, 2003. Baldwin and Bello were nominated for Golden Globe Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards for their supporting performances, with Baldwin also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

== Plot ==
In Las Vegas, unlucky Bernie Lootz works at the Shangri-La casino as a &quot;cooler&quot; - a man with near-professional bad luck, his presence at a casino designed to stop people from winning. A cocktail waitress, Natalie, takes no real notice of Bernie, who is smitten with her. The casino manager and partner, Shelly, prides himself on running a &quot;classically&quot; Las Vegas casino, and resents the new establishments that attract a lower clientele. The owners, however, hire an advisor named Larry to help bring in more money with techniques contrary to Shelly&#x27;s outdated policies. Bernie informs Shelly that he is leaving town in a week.

After an encounter during which Bernie rescues Natalie from an aggressive customer, she appears to take an interest in him. Eager to prevent Bernie from leaving the casino, Shelly secretly prods Natalie into asking him out for a drink. They end up sleeping together, after which Natalie takes a genuine interest in Bernie. Although they begin seeing each other, Bernie is apprehensive due to his mostly bad luck. He reveals to Natalie that he used to be a gambling addict and was in huge debt to several casinos; Shelly &quot;saved&quot; him by breaking his kneecap and paying off his debts in exchange for Bernie&#x27;s work as a cooler for six years, which ends at the end of the week. By accident, the couple run into Bernie&#x27;s estranged son Mikey and his pregnant wife Charlotte, who are scamming a diner by faking labor. Bernie tells Mikey to stop by the casino sometime.

Bernie is happy with his new relationship and his &quot;cooling&quot; abilities fade, much to Shelly&#x27;s anger. Mikey and Charlotte come by the motel and Bernie gives them $3,000, but Natalie is skeptical of Charlotte&#x27;s behavior. When Bernie reveals to Natalie he intends to leave Vegas, she initially says she won&#x27;t go with him and Bernie is upset. When Bernie fails to cool Mikey at the craps table, Shelly realizes he is being cheated by Mikey. Shelly takes Mikey and Charlotte downstairs and his crew begins beating Mikey. Bernie then promises to pay the $150,000 Mikey was up, but Shelly breaks Mikey&#x27;s hand and punches Charlotte, revealing her pregnancy was being faked anyway. Though distraught, that night Natalie and Bernie confess their love for one another, and Bernie again becomes a good luck charm.

Shelly calls Natalie to his office and reminds her that he hired her to date Bernie so he wouldn&#x27;t leave Vegas, not to fall in love with him, which has made him both happy and lucky. He forces her to leave town abruptly, which hurts Bernie and ruins his luck. Natalie does truly love Bernie, though, and returns, thus restoring Bernie&#x27;s luck. Shelly goes to Bernie&#x27;s motel room and begins packing for Natalie. Arguing, Shelly slaps Natalie thus knocking her face into a mirror which shatters and leaves her severely cut up. After a tense exchange wherein she claims Bernie is the closest thing Shelly has to a friend and he doesn&#x27;t want him to leave, he simply leaves her there. When Bernie comes home, she reveals Shelly hired her to pretend to like him, but she truly fell in love with him. Bernie take Natalie to the hospital emergency room after which he consoles her over her injured face.

Banking on his good luck brought on by Natalie&#x27;s devotion, Bernie confronts Shelly and calls him a coward with nothing in his life but the casino. Shelly lets him go on the condition he pay back the $150,000, which Bernie tries to win at craps. Larry wants Shelly to stop Bernie’s hot streak, but Shelly takes him into the men’s room and beats him, breaking his hand. Bernie leaves, and he and Natalie drive away from Vegas. He pulls over and reveals that he won a lot of money, but a cop presumably sent by Larry approaches and readies to kill them. Meanwhile, Shelly gets in his car and finds his partner waiting for him. On Larry&#x27;s behalf, he murders Shelly, saying they have to protect their interests. A drunk driver accidentally hits and kills the cop and Bernie remarks it was freaky luck, a freaky accident. Larry meets with investors as new director of casino operations and toasts a very bright future. Bernie and Natalie shown driving off into desert leaving a casino billboard behind them.

==Cast==
==Production==
Though &quot;The Cooler&quot; is set near Fremont Street in Las Vegas, it was mainly filmed in Reno at the Golden Phoenix Reno over the course of three weeks. Golden Phoenix Reno casino employees and Reno locals were used extensively in the filming of &quot;The Cooler&quot;. The Golden Phoenix Hotel Casino is now a completed condominium project called The Montage. The hotel buildings demolished during the closing credits are the Aladdin, the Sands, the Landmark, and the Dunes hotels.

In an episode of the Sundance Channel series &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot;, director Wayne Kramer and members of his cast and crew discussed various aspects of &quot;The Cooler&quot;. In order to show Bernie&#x27;s evolution from loser to winner, costume designer Kristin M. Burke dressed him in suits and clothes that progressively became better fits. Early in the film, the character resembles a boy dressed in his father&#x27;s oversized clothing. By the end, Bernie is not only wearing the right size suit, but he has accessorized it with a brightly colored shirt and tie that represent his sunnier disposition. Lighting schemes designed by cinematographer Jim Whitaker also contributed to documenting Bernie&#x27;s progression. In early scenes, his face is kept in the shadows, but later he is filmed in a spotlight and backlit to make him stand out from everything behind him.

The song &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;, which is used to mark Bernie&#x27;s transition from mournful sad sack to winner, was written by Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner for the stage musical &quot;Brigadoon&quot;.

== Release ==
The film premiere was at the Sundance Film Festival. &quot;The Cooler&quot; was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Deauville Film Festival, among others, before going into limited release in the United States. The film expanded nationwide on December 19, 2003.

With an estimated budget of $4 million, &quot;The Cooler&quot; grossed $8,291,572 in the United States and $2,173,216 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $10,464,788.

According to the 2006 documentary film &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated&quot;, the MPAA originally rated the film NC-17 because of a glimpse of Maria Bello&#x27;s pubic hair during a sex scene. The scene was edited in order for the film to gain an R rating and thus be shown in theaters. A director&#x27;s cut has been broadcast by the Independent Film Channel and Cinemax.

=== Critical reception ===
The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with considerable praise for Alec Baldwin&#x27;s performance. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A small movie elevated by superb performances.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott said, &quot;The setting ... is a little tired, and the premise is pretty hokey. Mr. Kramer, rather than trying to discover anything new, is content to recycle familiar characters and story lines. The script ... and the direction are skillful, if occasionally gimmicky ... Luckily this picture is rescued from cliché by the quality of the acting, and Mr. Kramer wisely gives the actors room to work.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said the film &quot;has a strange way of being broad and twisted at the same time, so that while we surf the surface of the story, unexpected developments are stirring beneath ... This is a movie without gimmicks, hooks or flashy slickness ... The acting is on the money, the writing has substance, the direction knows when to evoke film noir and when ... to get fancy.&quot;

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers rated the film three and a half out of a possible four stars and added, &quot;Wayne Kramer, who co-wrote the scrappy script with Frank Hannah, makes a potent directing debut and strikes gold with the cast... Top of the line is Baldwin, whose revelatory portrayal of an old Vegas hard-liner in thrall to the town&#x27;s faded allure is the stuff Oscars are made of. From James Whitaker&#x27;s seductive camerawork to Mark Isham&#x27;s lush score, &quot;The Cooler&quot; places all the smart bets and hits the jackpot.&quot;

Mark Holcomb of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said, &quot;Taking a page from the Sin City cinema revisionist&#x27;s handbook, &quot;The Cooler&quot; mimics the Vegas insider&#x27;s perspective of &quot;Casino&quot; (without Scorsese&#x27;s fetishistic attention to detail), the seedy/saccharine insouciance of FX&#x27;s &quot;Lucky&quot; (devoid of quirky chutzpah), and the couch-potato glitz of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Las Vegas&quot; ... What&#x27;s left never gels as fantasy, drama, or romantic comedy... [the] film never amounts to more than a cute idea stretched to poker-chip thinness.&quot;

<doc id="468351" wikidata="Q9584260" url="?curid=468351" title="Special Esperanto adverbs">
<text>A limited number of Esperanto adverbs do not end with the regular adverbial ending &quot;-e&quot;. Many of them function as more than just adverbs, such as &quot;hodiaŭ&quot; &quot;today&quot; (noun or adverb) and &quot;ankoraŭ&quot; &quot;yet&quot; or &quot;still&quot; (conjunction or adverb). Others are part of the correlative system, and will not be repeated here.

The word class &quot;adverb&quot; is not well defined in any language, and it is sometimes difficult to say whether a word is an adverb. The Esperanto suffix &quot;-e&quot; is restricted to words that are clearly adverbial.

==Adverbs and the suffix &quot;-aŭ&quot;==
Alongside dedicated part-of-speech suffixes of Esperanto, such as adverbial &quot;-e&quot;, adjectival &quot;-a&quot;, and nominal &quot;-o&quot;, the language has a grammatically neutral suffix &quot;-aŭ&quot; that has no defined part of speech. Words ending in &quot;-aŭ&quot; may be used for multiple grammatical functions. They are typically words whose part of speech is difficult to identify in other languages. The suffix &quot;-aŭ&quot; is not lexically productive: it is limited to a closed class of only a few words. To specify the part of speech of these words, the dedicated suffixes may be added to the &quot;-aŭ&quot;. For example, &quot;anstataŭ&quot; &quot;instead of&quot; (preposition and conjunction) is the base of the adverb &quot;anstataŭe&quot; &quot;instead&quot;, the adjective &quot;anstataŭa&quot; &quot;interim&quot; or &quot;deputy&quot;, the verb &quot;anstataŭi&quot; &quot;to take the place of&quot;, and the noun &quot;anstataŭo&quot; &quot;replacement&quot; or &quot;substitution&quot;. Most &quot;-aŭ&quot; words have inherent adverbial uses; &quot;anstataŭ&quot; is one of the few that do not. The adverbial &quot;-aŭ&quot; words are:

Because this &quot;-aŭ&quot; is a suffix, it may be dropped or replaced by a productive grammatical suffix. For example, alongside &quot;anstataŭe&quot; and &quot;anstataŭigi&quot; etc. there are &quot;anstate&quot;, &quot;anstatigi&quot; etc., and in poetic usage there is &quot;anstat″&quot; for &quot;anstataŭ&quot;, but these are rare.

:&#x27;In 1892 Zamenhof proposed the following change: &quot;Instead of the ending &#x27;-aŭ&#x27; in various words one can use an apostrophe [e.g. &quot;ankor″&quot;, &quot;apen″&quot;]... This will increase sonorousness, while not introducing any confusion (because &#x27;-aŭ&#x27; does not belong to the root, but is only a conditional ending, and thus as easy to leave off as the &#x27;-o&#x27; of the noun).&quot; But this elision of &quot;-aŭ&quot; from adverbs was not put into practice; only in recent years have a few poets attempted to use it in verse.&#x27;

:&quot;There have already been attempts to use these words in simple adverbial form (&quot;morge&quot;, &quot;apene&quot;, &quot;anke&quot;, &quot;ankore&quot;, &quot;almene&quot;, etc.), which would certainly bring along the simple adjectival form (&quot;ankora&quot;, &quot;almena&quot;, &quot;apena&quot;) and the nominal form (&quot;hiero&quot;, &quot;hodio&quot;, &quot;morgo&quot;). These attempts are even officially tolerated by the Academy [since 1910].&quot;

==Bare-root adverbs==

Other (so-called) adverbs occur as bare roots, without any suffix. Some of these bare-root words are grammatical particles, in which case true adverbs may be derived from them by adding the suffix &quot;-e&quot;. They are:

Occasionally grammatically redundant forms such as &quot;tree&quot; are seen in poetry.

<doc id="468352" wikidata="Q104840555" url="?curid=468352" title="Canneto di Caronia fires">
<text>In 2004–2005, there was a series of unusual fires in Canneto di Caronia, Sicily (Italy). Although popular speculation ascribed the fires to paranormal events or secret military technology, official investigations concluded that the fires were cases of arson.

==2003–04 events==
Canneto di Caronia is a village in Sicily, home to roughly 150 people.

Events began on 23 December 2003, at Antonino Pezzino&#x27;s home on Via Mare; Pezzino&#x27;s television reportedly exploded. Similar malfunctions reportedly affected fuse boxes, air conditioners, kitchen appliances, computers, and electronic car door locks. Fires were also said to have struck wedding presents and a piece of furniture. At least one person was said to have observed an unplugged electrical cable ignite while he was directly observing it.

On 9 February 2004, two houses on Via Mare burned. In response, Mayor Spinnato issued an order evacuating the 39 residents of Via Mare from their homes to the town&#x27;s only hotel. ENEL, the Italian power utility, cut power to the town, but fires continued. From January through to March, 92 fires were reported.

On 11 February, an investigation was announced by the local prosecutor. On 16 March, fires resumed, and investigators reportedly witnessed malfunctions in compasses, electronic car locks, and cell phones.

In April, the government formed an interdisciplinary research group, coordinated by Francesco Venerando Mantegna from the Sicilian Protezione Civile. That team reportedly had widespread cooperation from the nation&#x27;s armed forces, police, as well as utilities. Venerando&#x27;s team reported anomalous &#x27;electromagnetic activity&#x27;, unexplained lights, and a helicopter that experienced allegedly-anomalous rotor damage. Scientists from the National Research Institute (CNR), with the support of NASA physicists, were also involved in investigating the events.

In June 2004, residents were returned to their homes on Via Mare.
Explanations for the events have ranged from the mundane to the paranormal. Public speculation attributed the events to poltergeists, demons, or UFOs. In 2007 it was proposed that the phenomena were caused by intermittent electromagnetic emissions. On 24 June 2008, following further investigation by the appointed experts, the case was dismissed by the prosecutor of Mistretta. The conclusion of the consultants was that the fires were arson cases.

==2014–15 events==
Mysterious fires returned in mid-2014.
On 5 March 2015, police arrested and charged Giuseppe Pezzino, 26, with arson, conspiracy to commit fraud, and sounding a false alarm in association with the mysterious fires. His father, Antonino Pezzino, has also been implicated. The Italian military police had installed hidden cameras in the streets after the fires started again in July 2014. Video captured about 40 incidents implicating Giuseppe (and occasionally, Antonino). Further evidence was gathered by phone taps.

==In popular culture==
The fires were featured in the US television program &quot;The Unexplained Files&quot;. In 2019, the fires were featured on the program &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="468353" wikidata="Q1141912" url="?curid=468353" title="Thirteen (2003 film)">
<text>Thirteen is a 2003 teen drama film directed by Catherine Hardwicke, written by Hardwicke and Nikki Reed, and starring Holly Hunter, Evan Rachel Wood and Reed with Jeremy Sisto, Brady Corbet, Deborah Kara Unger, Kip Pardue, Sarah Clarke, D. W. Moffett, Vanessa Hudgens (in her film acting debut), and Jenicka Carey in supporting roles. Loosely based on Reed&#x27;s life from ages 12 to 13, the film&#x27;s plot follows Tracy, a seventh-grade student in Los Angeles who begins dabbling in substance abuse, sex, self harm, and crime after being befriended by a troubled classmate.

The screenplay for &quot;Thirteen&quot; was written over six days by Hardwicke and the then-14-year-old Reed; Hardwicke, a former production designer, marking her directorial debut, independently raised funds herself for the production.

Upon the film&#x27;s debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2003, Hardwicke won the Sundance Directing (Drama) for the film. Fox Searchlight Pictures subsequently acquired &quot;Thirteen&quot; for distribution, giving the film a limited release in the United States beginning on August 20, 2003; the release would expand in September 2003 and the film went on to gross a total of $4.6 million at the U.S. box office.

Though it received numerous favorable reviews from critics, &quot;Thirteen&quot; generated some controversy for its depiction of youth drug use (including inhalants, marijuana, LSD and alcohol), underage sexual behavior, and self-harm. The film earned Hunter an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and Golden Globe nominations for Hunter and Wood for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress in a Drama, respectively.

==Plot==
13-year-old Tracy Freeland begins the seventh grade as a smart, mild-mannered honors student at a middle school in Los Angeles. Her divorced mother Melanie is a recovering alcoholic who struggles to support Tracy and her older brother Mason by working as a hairdresser. Melanie is too busy and occupied with her fellow ex-addict boyfriend Brady to notice Tracy&#x27;s increasing depression.

On the first day of school, Tracy encounters classmate Evie Zamora, who is considered the most stylish and popular girl in school. After being teased by Evie’s clique for her &quot;Cabbage Patch&quot; clothes, Tracy is mortified and decides to shed her &quot;little girl&quot; image. At a store owned by Melanie&#x27;s friend, Tracy happily finds trendier clothes as Melanie offers a few dollars in change as payment.

Tracy wears one of her new outfits to school and catches Evie&#x27;s attention. Evie invites Tracy to go shopping on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood but gives her a fake phone number to prank her. Nevertheless, Tracy determinedly shows up on Melrose Avenue and meets with Evie and her friend Astrid. Tracy is uncomfortable with the two shoplifting and excuses herself to sit outside the store on a bench. When a distracted woman sits next to Tracy, she steals the woman&#x27;s wallet, which impresses Evie and Astrid. The three go on a shopping spree with the stolen money, and Tracy and Evie quickly become friends.

Evie introduces an intrigued and excited Tracy to her world of sex, drugs, and crime. Tracy’s behavior and priorities dramatically shift. She frequently skips class, neglects her school work, and abandons her old circle of friends in favor or Evie and her clique. Evie tells Melanie that Brooke, her adult cousin and guardian, is out of town for two weeks, and Melanie agrees to let her stay at her home with Tracy. While staying there, Evie discovers that Tracy regularly cuts herself to cope with stress. Although Melanie sees a drastic change in Tracy&#x27;s personality and worries about the extent of Evie&#x27;s influence, she cannot find a way to intervene. Melanie attempts to send Evie home but reluctantly lets her stay after Evie claims Brooke’s boyfriend is physically and sexually abusive. As Tracy and Evie become closer, Tracy grows increasingly hostile towards Melanie.

Evie and Tracy engage in more destructive activities, each egging the other on. The pair attempt to seduce Tracy&#x27;s adult neighbor, Luke, and ditch a family movie night to get high on the streets in Hollywood. Mason is shocked when he bumps into Tracy wearing sexualized clothing, including thong underwear, but Tracy dismisses his concerns. Later on, the girls take turns inhaling from a can of gas duster for electronics and become so intoxicated that they take turns hitting each other.

Melanie attempts to break the girls&#x27; friendship by sending Tracy to live with her father, but he refuses, claiming to be too busy. After Evie&#x27;s stay extends over two weeks, Melanie unsuccessfully attempts to contact Brooke and then visits Brooke&#x27;s home with Evie and Tracy. They find that Brooke was hiding because of a botched plastic surgery. Evie asks Melanie to formally adopt her but Melanie refuses. Tracy meekly supports her mother&#x27;s decision. Angry and hurt, a tearful Evie storms off. Later, Evie ostracizes Tracy and spreads rumors about her at school. Tracy slowly begins to realize the negative effects of her lifestyle when she is told that she will have to repeat the seventh grade.

While walking home from school, Brady offers Tracy a ride and takes her home, where Melanie, Evie, and Brooke sit quietly in the living room waiting for her. Brooke, having been convinced by Evie that it was Tracy who was the bad influence, confronts Tracy about her drug use and stealing. Outraged, Tracy insists that Evie is the instigator, but the skeptical Brooke refuses to listen and announces that she is moving Evie to Ojai to keep her away from Tracy. When Melanie defends Tracy&#x27;s innocence, Brooke pulls Tracy&#x27;s sleeve up to show her self-harm scars. Melanie orders Brooke and Evie out of the house and tries to comfort Tracy. Tracy breaks down and tearfully fights against Melanie’s embrace. Melanie persists and assures Tracy that she loves her and will not let her go, and the two fall asleep together on Tracy&#x27;s bed. The last scene shows a dream sequence of Tracy spinning alone and screaming on a park merry-go-round during the daytime.

==Production==
===Development===
Director Catherine Hardwicke, who had worked prior as a film production designer, has called Nikki Reed a &quot;surrogate daughter&quot;, having known her since she was five years old. Hardwicke had been in a long-term relationship with Reed&#x27;s father for a time. The two began the screenplay as a comedy project which would be shot to video at minimal cost. The screenplay was written over a period of six days in January 2002, and quickly shifted into a tale of early teen angst and self-destruction in Los Angeles, with Tracy&#x27;s character drawn from Reed&#x27;s own recent experiences as an early teen. Reed said she specifically was inspired by experiencing her friends&#x27; arrests for dealing methamphetamine when she was thirteen years old.

Reed later stated in 2012 that she regrets the way she portrayed her family in the autobiographical film, saying, &quot;I wrote this movie about them and their flaws and imperfections and what it was like growing up. It was from one kid&#x27;s perspective and not a well-rounded one. You get older and it&#x27;s like, how dare I portray my father as being a totally vacant careless schmuck?&quot;

After completing the script, Hardwicke pitched the idea to various producers she knew, but said that most were &quot;terrified&quot; of the project because of the subject matter. “All the characters are women, and it was going to be rated R and about a teenager. That does not check the boxes for any studio,” Hardwicke said of the difficulty of finding financiers for the film.

===Casting===
Hardwicke didn&#x27;t think it would be fitting for Reed to play Tracy and auditioned hundreds of girls for the part. After becoming aware of Evan Rachel Wood, Hardwicke came to believe she could make the film only with Wood in the role of Tracy and only that year, with Wood at that age.

Hardwicke has said Holly Hunter&#x27;s agreement to play the role of Tracy&#x27;s mother Melanie was a key boost to bringing the production together; she met with Hunter in New York City to discuss the film, after which Hunter agreed to take the part. Hunter recalled: &quot;I read the script and it was a very visceral experience. It&#x27;s extremely raw, it was not a filled-in picture. It felt more like a feeling than anything else. And that&#x27;s unusual for a script to communicate like that. It sort of declares itself, it comes at you. And the movie does, too. And that&#x27;s unusual, for a movie to be able to have the same impetus on the screen that it has on the page.&quot; Brie Larson, who was herself 13 when the film released, auditioned for one of the parts in the film but was rejected.

Hardwicke subsequently managed to raise approximately $2 million, almost all through independent equity financing. Most of the adult actors were widely known and all of them reportedly agreed to low pay because they liked the script along with other members of the cast and crew. Wood and Reed were both 14 years old during filming (Wood turned 15 during the shoot).

===Filming===
&quot;Thirteen&quot; was shot on lower-cost super 16mm film over a period of 24 days between July 2002 and September 2002. The camera was small, had a Panavision lens, and was mostly hand-held by cinematographer Elliot Davis, which helped achieve a documentary, &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; style. Principal photography took place on location in Los Angeles, with Melrose Avenue, Hollywood Boulevard, and Venice Beach serving as filming locations. The Freeland home scenes were shot at a rented house in the San Fernando Valley. The outdoor school scenes were shot at Portola Middle School in Tarzana, California.

Some scenes in the film were carefully and colorfully lit, while others were shot only with whatever daylight could be had. Due to child labor laws, the underage performers were only allowed to work a regulated number of hours per day. This made for a frenetic production atmosphere, which cast and crew later said matched the script and added to the film&#x27;s fast and emotionally taut pace. The film stock was transferred to the digital domain wherein the colors and saturation were highly manipulated for some segments. The beginning of the film was very slightly desaturated in the scenes before Tracy became friends with Evie. Once they became friends, the saturation was increased to a &quot;glowy&quot; effect, according to Hardwicke. After the scene where Evie and Tracy make out with Luke, the saturation slowly becomes less and less until the end of the film, especially after Evie is told that she can&#x27;t live with Tracy anymore and Tracy is abandoned by the popular group.

The wardrobe worn by the girls was mostly their own. As filming progressed, the girls began dressing similarly without being asked to do so. The girls did not take any dangerous substances during the film. They are shown smoking cigarettes, but these were filled mostly with catnip. The crushed pills they are shown snorting from the cover of a children&#x27;s book were actually vitamins.

All of the scenes in which Tracy cut herself were shot in a single day; Wood recalled running to her brother for emotional support between some takes. Wood later described the shooting of the two make-out scenes with Javi and Luke as &quot;awkward&quot; because her family was watching behind the scenes. Wood&#x27;s mother requested that in the scenes with Tracy&#x27;s bra exposed, the front of her not be seen on camera. The whole scene with Luke was rendered in a single, long and uncut take with Wood, Reed, and Pardue but was tightly choreographed with several crew members, social workers and parents also in the small room, carefully staying either hidden or behind the camera as it panned more than 200°, showing all four walls.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Thirteen&quot; was picked up by Fox Searchlight Pictures after production was completed while Working Title Films held U.K. rights with Working Title&#x27;s parent company Universal Pictures distributing the film in the United Kingdom and Ireland through United International Pictures. The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2003. In the United States, it was given a limited release on August 20, 2003, in New York City, followed by its Los Angeles premiere on August 22. At the film&#x27;s premiere screenings in Manhattan, brochures for Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) were distributed.

During its opening weekend, the film earned $116,260 at the U.S. box office, showing on 5 screens. Its release expanded to 243 theaters on September 19, 2003, and it went on to gross a total of $4,601,043 in the United States before concluding its theatrical run on December 18, 2003. In international markets, it grossed a further $5,527,917, making for a worldwide gross of $10.1 million.

===Critical response===

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing: &quot;Who is this movie for? Not for most 13-year-olds, that&#x27;s for sure. The R rating is richly deserved, no matter how much of a lark the poster promises. Maybe the film is simply for those who admire fine, focused acting and writing; &quot;Thirteen&quot; sets a technical problem that seems insoluble, and meets it brilliantly, finding convincing performances from its teenage stars, showing [...] a parent who is clueless but not uncaring, and a world outside that bedroom window that has big bad wolves, and worse.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The movie has the ebb and flow that come from material structured as a series of anecdotes—it doesn&#x27;t build, and sometimes feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old&#x27;s bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, working to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clichés that inform pictures about teenagers. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander—in &quot;Thirteen&quot;, she&#x27;s the fuse.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Manohla Dargis characterized the film as an &quot;arty exploitation flick,&quot; adding: &quot;Only audiences that have been locked inside a bomb shelter for the last 50 years will be shocked by what happens in &quot;Thirteen&quot;. The clothes are scantier and the music heavier on the bass since James Dean yelled &quot;You&#x27;re tearing me apart!&quot; to his befuddled father in the mid-1950s melodrama &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;. But the story about the anguished outsider trying to fit in no matter what hasn&#x27;t changed much since the movies discovered the troubled teenager.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Laura Stepp noted in her review that the film &quot;portrays adolescence at its most desperate. If you have a daughter in her early teens or almost there, the R-rated film will make you want to run home, hold her tightly for a few minutes, and then lock her up while you struggle with all the questions the film raises but doesn&#x27;t answer.&quot;

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film &quot;a chilling look at a pair of contemporary Valley girls—13-year-olds who are way beyond their years but also are nearly beyond repair,&quot; while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Michael Wilmington called it &quot;an excellent, unforgettable film,&quot; but also deemed it &quot;extremely disturbing.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
The score was written by Mark Mothersbaugh. An official soundtrack was released on August 19, 2003, by Nettwerk Records, which includes songs by Liz Phair, Clinic, Folk Implosion, Imperial Teen, Katy Rose, The Like, and MC 900 Ft. Jesus.

<text>Pieces of April is a 2003 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Peter Hedges. Marking Hedges&#x27; directorial debut, the film stars Katie Holmes, Derek Luke, Sean Hayes, Alison Pill, Oliver Platt and Patricia Clarkson. The film follows April (Holmes), as she attempts to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family.

The film premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, and received mostly positive reviews. It grossed over worldwide on a $300,000 budget. Patricia Clarkson received numerous nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role, including at the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards, and also won the title at many smaller film awards.

== Plot ==
April Burns, the eldest daughter in a highly dysfunctional family, lives in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with her boyfriend Bobby. Although estranged from her parents, Jim and Joy, and younger siblings Beth and Timmy, she opts to invite them for Thanksgiving dinner. It is expected to be the last Thanksgiving for Joy, who is dying from breast cancer.

April&#x27;s parents and siblings, along with April&#x27;s senile grandmother, start a long drive from suburbia to New York City, while April prepares to cook dinner. Bobby leaves the apartment to purchase a suit so he can make a good impression upon meeting April&#x27;s family. Upon attempting to cook the Thanksgiving turkey, April discovers that her oven is broken, and solicits help from other people in her apartment building; she receives help, hindrance, and indifference from the disparate group of residents, but eventually completes the meal.

As April&#x27;s family makes the road trip, their dysfunctional relationship with her is discussed. Beth constantly expresses her disapproval of visiting April, while Joy is pessimistic about the prospect of the dinner being enjoyable. Jim remains positive, and Timmy takes photographs of their trip. Frequent stops have to be made as Joy is sick. After initial difficulty, Bobby finds a suit and begins heading home, only to be confronted by April&#x27;s former boyfriend, a drug dealer named Tyrone. A fight ensues, ruining Bobby&#x27;s suit jacket and leaving his face bloody. April&#x27;s family arrives outside her derelict apartment building. Initially hesitant to leave their car due to the poverty of the neighborhood, they are then approached by a battered Bobby, who introduces himself. Her family subsequently leaves, opting to purchase a meal at a diner instead. April is crestfallen after learning the news.

After witnessing a confrontation between a mother and her young daughter in the diner&#x27;s bathroom, Joy reconsiders. Along with Timmy, the pair ask two motorcycle riders to take them back to April&#x27;s apartment. April has since decided to share her Thanksgiving meal with several residents of her apartment building who helped her prepare it. Joy proceeds to April&#x27;s apartment, where the two have an emotional reunion, photographed by Timmy. The rest of April&#x27;s family later arrives, and all embrace her. April&#x27;s family, together with the residents of the building, are shown having an enjoyable time.

== Themes ==
&quot;Pieces of April&quot; explores themes of &#x27;racing against time&#x27;, evidenced by Joy&#x27;s cancer and that it is expected to be the last Thanksgiving with her alive. This theme is reinforced by April&#x27;s race to get dinner cooked in time and by Bobby&#x27;s search to find a suit and return home. Writer/director Peter Hedges&#x27; screenplays are renowned for having themes of humanity and truth; interviewed regarding the film, Hedges said he does not write stories to help people escape life, but rather to help them embrace it. Hedges said he hoped the film would trigger something in people, either to take action or reflect on their own lives.

== Production ==
===Pre-production===
Hedges started working on the script for &quot;Pieces of April&quot; about eight or nine years before the film was released, though eventually forgot about the project. After his mother was diagnosed with cancer, she encouraged him to continue writing. Hedges went looking through his old drafts and remembered that the mother in &quot;Pieces of April&quot; also has cancer. After telling his own mother of this, she told him it sounded like a project he should work on. Hedges says he only began putting serious effort into the script after his mother had died. He said that while the film was not autobiographical, it was definitely impacted by his mother&#x27;s death, concluding that he wanted to make a film that was not about her, but instead a tribute to her; the film is dedicated to her memory. Hedges was additionally inspired by a true story about a group of friends who had &quot;borrowed&quot; an apartment to prepare a Thanksgiving dinner. When they went to cook their turkey they discovered their oven did not work, so had to go door to door in the building to try and use one of their neighbor&#x27;s. &quot;Pieces of April&quot; was in pre-production on three occasions, each time with a budget of around $7 million, though attempts to get the film off the ground repeatedly failed. The fourth time Hedges attempted to get the film developed, he took it to independent company InDigEnt, who signed it immediately, albeit on a much smaller budget of $300,000.

===Casting===
Katie Holmes had always agreed to play the lead role; Hedges said he thought she was drawn to the role as it differed so much from characters she had previously portrayed. Oliver Platt and Patricia Clarkson had already agreed to work on the film the third time it was in pre-production with a budget of $7 million, though were happy to remain on board with the reduced wages the new budget offered, which only gave cast and crew $200 and $100 a day respectively; Hedges was paid $10 to write and another $10 to direct the film. Sean Hayes called Hedges from the set of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, asking for the part of Bobby. Hedges explained that Bobby was to be African-American, and instead suggested the role of Wayne. Hayes asked if he could fly to New York to audition, at which point Hedges informed him there was no need as he was already hired. Sisqó also originally applied for the role of Bobby, though Hedges did not think he was suited to the role as he was shorter than Holmes, and instead suggested he play Latrell. Derek Luke was the last person to audition for Bobby, and Hedges was so impressed with his performance he hired him immediately.

===Filming===
&quot;Pieces of April&quot; was filmed in 16 days. Due to the tight schedule many locations, such as the Burns family home and the Salvation Army store, were only available for a single day. Due to time limitations, some scenes showing the Burns family driving to visit April were actually shot while the actors were driving to additional filming locations. Two apartments in New York were used for filming, one for shots of hallways and stairs and one for the inside of apartments. Some original residents of the apartments were used as extras. Filming was often challenging as the spaces to work in were small. &quot;Pieces of April&quot; was shot digitally with hand-held cameras, and almost exclusively used close and medium shots due to limitations in resolution in wide digital shots at the time. Many scenes were filmed with two cameras at the same time, allowing them to be filmed in one take.

===Soundtrack===

The film&#x27;s title is taken from a 1972 song of the same name by Three Dog Night. Hedges had intended to use the song at the end of the film, though Stephin Merritt, who was hired for the film&#x27;s score, advised him against doing so. Hedges instead asked Merritt to compose an original song to close the film. Merritt&#x27;s soundtrack to the film was released on Nonesuch Records on November 4, 2003 to mostly favorable reviews.

== Reception ==
=== Initial screening and box office ===
&quot;Pieces of April&quot; debuted at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. Following its positive reception there, the rights to the film were reported to be in a bidding war with companies including Miramax, Fine Line Features and Artisan Entertainment. United Artists ended up securing the worldwide release rights from Cinetic Media in January 2003.

The film earned over $2.5 million domestically and a further $743,364 internationally for a total gross of over $3.2 million.

=== Critical response ===

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 153 critics, with an average rating of 7.12/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Pieces of April&quot; transcends its small-scale setting and budget with endearing performances, playful humor, and genuine sweetness, resulting in a touching holiday treat.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film an &quot;intelligent and touching farce&quot; and added, &quot;Mr. Hedges dances from one vignette to another with a mouthwatering finesse.&quot; 
Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, praising its humor and quirkiness and describing it as &quot;well-intentioned in its screwy way, with flashes of human insight, and actors who can take a moment and make it glow.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also rated it three stars out of four, praising Holmes for her performance which he described as holding the film together, while Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film &quot;both heartfelt and tough-minded&quot;, praising Holmes and describing Clarkson&#x27;s performance as &quot;her finest among about 100 fine Clarkson performances in the past few years&quot;.

One of the film&#x27;s few less-favorable reviews came from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; who gave it a &#x27;C&#x27;, calling it a &quot;glib comedy&quot; and adding, &quot;Hedges shoves his characters into sitcom slots and seals them there.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;Pieces of April&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Independent Film at the 2004 British Independent Film Awards, though lost to South Korean film &quot;Oldboy&quot;. Peter Hedges was nominated for Best Screenplay at the 19th Independent Spirit Awards and also the Humanitas Prize at the 29th Humanitas Awards. He won both the Audience Choice Award and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2003 Chicago International Film Festival.

Patricia Clarkson received numerous best supporting actress nominations for her role, including at the 76th Academy Awards, the 61st Golden Globe Awards, the 10th Screen Actors Guild Awards. and the 19th Independent Spirit Awards. In 2003, she won in that category at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards, the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, the National Board of Review Awards and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards, and in 2004, she won it at the Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, the National Society of Film Critics Awards, and the Satellite Awards. She also won the &#x27;Special Jury Prize for Outstanding Dramatic Performance&#x27; award at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, for her roles in &quot;Pieces of April&quot;, and also &quot;The Station Agent&quot; and &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;.

<text>Dale Edward Kildee (September 16, 1929 – October 13, 2021) was an American politician who served as U.S. Representative of Michigan from 1977 to 2013. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

His district included Flint, Saginaw and Bay City. In July 2011, Kildee announced he would retire after his term was up in 2012. He was succeeded by his nephew Dan Kildee.

==Early life, education, and teaching career==
Kildee was born in Flint, Michigan on September 16, 1929 to Timothy and Norma (Ullmer) Kildee. He was the fourth of five children. In his senior year of high school, he won the American Legion Medal of Citizenship. In 1947, Kildee received his high school diploma from St. Mary&#x27;s High School.

He earned his B.A. from Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit, Michigan in 1952. He earned a teacher&#x27;s certificate from the University of Detroit in 1955. He did graduate work in history and political science at the University of Peshawar in Pakistan from 1958 to 1959 under a Rotary Foundation Fellowship. He earned an M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1961. He was a teacher at the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy from 1954-56. Coming back in 1956 to Flint, Kildee taught Latin until 1964.

==Michigan legislature==
Kildee served as a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives 81st district from 1965 to 1974. He then subsequently served as a member of the Michigan State Senate from 1975 to 1976.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1976, incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Donald Riegle resigned after being appointed to fill the vacant seat in the U.S. Senate caused by the death of Philip Hart. State Senator Kildee won the general election with 70% of the vote. He won re-election 17 times, each with at least 56% of the vote except in 1992, 1994, and 2010. In 1992, he defeated Megan O&#x27;Neill with 54% of the vote. He won Genesee County with 74%, while he lost the district&#x27;s other two counties: Oakland and Lapeer. In the 1994 rematch, he defeated her with just 51% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage of his career. In 2010, he defeated Republican farmer and businessman John Kupiec with 53% of the vote. Kupiec won Tuscola County with 60%, while losing the district&#x27;s other three counties. Kildee won Bay (49%), Saginaw (61%), and Genesee Counties (55%).

===Tenure===
In 1997, Kildee founded the House&#x27;s Native American Caucus to advocate Native American issues. In 2010, Kildee revealed that he would be voting for the Senate version of the Health Care reform bill without the Stupak Amendment language restricting federal abortion funding. In addition, reports surfaced that he attempted to convince anti-abortion Democrats in the Stupak coalition to vote for the bill.

===Committee assignments===
He was a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and served as ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Education Reform and a member of the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations. He was also a member of the House Committee on Resources, where he sat on the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands and the Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health. From 1993 on, he served as co-chair of the Congressional Automotive Caucus. From 1997 on, he served as co-chair of the Native American Caucus.

==Personal life==
He met his future wife Gayle, a French teacher, while teaching at Central High School. They married in 1965 and had three children, Paul, Laura, and David. Both sons became army captains; their daughter became a commercial property manager.

In November 2011, Patrick Kildee, a second cousin of the congressman, accused Kildee of sexually abusing him more than 50 years previously when he was 12 years old. In response Kildee called the allegation untrue.

Kildee died on October 13, 2021, in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 92.

Kildee was a Roman Catholic.

<doc id="468360" wikidata="Q505236" url="?curid=468360" title="Fred Upton">
<text>Frederick Stephen Upton (born April 23, 1953) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative from Michigan from 1987 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he represented Kalamazoo and much of southwestern Michigan for 18 terms before retiring in 2023.

A former chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Upton has played a major role in shaping post-Obamacare health care legislation. He is the only person in American history to vote to impeach two presidents; he voted for the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 and the second impeachment of Donald Trump in 2021, as one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. After Sander Levin retired at the end of the 115th Congress, Upton became the dean of Michigan&#x27;s congressional delegation.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Upton was born in St. Joseph, Michigan, the son of Elizabeth B. (née Vial) and Stephen Edward Upton (1924–2022). He attended Shattuck-Saint Mary&#x27;s, graduating in 1971. He earned a B.A. in journalism from the University of Michigan in 1975. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Peninsular Chapter, and became a sports editor at &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; and thought he might someday cover the Chicago Cubs. He served on the congressional staff of U.S. Representative David Stockman from 1976 to 1980. He was in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1985, while Stockman served as OMB Director.

==U.S. House of Representatives==


===Elections===
====1986====
Upton ran in Michigan&#x27;s 4th congressional district against incumbent Mark Siljander, Stockman&#x27;s successor. Upton won the Republican primary 55%–45% and the general election with 62% of the vote.

====1988====
Upton won reelection to a second term with 71% of the vote.

Upton defeated Ed Fredricks in the Republican primary, 63%–37%. In the general election, he was reelected to a third term with 58% of the vote.

====2000====

After redistricting, Upton decided to run in the newly redrawn Michigan&#x27;s 6th congressional district, winning reelection to a fourth term with 62% of the vote.

====2002====

After redistricting, Upton faced a primary challenge from State Senator Dale Shugars. Upton defeated Shugars 66%–32%. He won the general election with 69% of the vote.

====2010====

====2012====

In 2011, Hoogendyk met with the Club for Growth, a conservative 501(c)4 organization, about running against Upton again. Upton had been criticized for not being conservative enough by Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, FreedomWorks, Right to Life of Michigan, and the Southwest Michigan Tea Party Patriots. On January 17, 2012, Hoogendyk announced that he would challenge Upton in the primary, the winner of which would face the Democratic nominee, former marine and businessman Mike O&#x27;Brien.

Initial polls showed Upton with a sizable lead over O&#x27;Brien, but an October poll showed Upton and O&#x27;Brien in a dead heat heading into the final stretch of the campaign.

===Tenure===

Upton has been a member of moderate Republican factions The Tuesday Group and the Republican Main Street Partnership. On February 4, 2021, he joined 10 other Republican House members voting with all voting Democrats to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments in response to controversial political statements she had made.

====Health care====
Upton voted against passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has since voted in favor of its complete repeal. In November 2013, in response to Americans losing their health insurance coverage because of the ACA, Upton proposed a bill that would allow them to retain it. The essence of his bill was to allow insurance companies to maintain their individual insurance market policies according to state insurance rules that were in effect as of 2013. In 2017, Upton played an important role advancing Republican Party efforts to repeal the ACA.

In 2013, Upton introduced a bill that would grant the Food and Drug Administration more power to regulate drug compounding in the wake of the New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak. In 2016, Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act into law, a bill Upton co-sponsored. The act establishes funds for biomedical research and to develop and implement a strategic plan for biomedical research. In 2018, Upton and Representative Debbie Dingell worked together on legislation designed to combat opioid addiction. Among other things, it would allocate funding for research into new, non-addictive pain relievers.

====Environment and energy====

In 2007 Upton co-sponsored the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which, among other things, mandated phased-in energy efficiency standards for most light bulbs. At the time, he noted that the legislation, ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush, would &quot;help preserve energy resources and reduce harmful emissions, all while saving American families billions of dollars on their electric bills.&quot; Glenn Beck called Upton &quot;all socialist&quot; for supporting the bill.

In April 2009, Upton said that &quot;climate change is a serious problem that necessitates serious solutions. Everything must be on the table.&quot; He would later be criticized for moderating his position on carbon emissions, leading a failed effort to stop the Obama administration from enforcing the new energy standards.

Upton&#x27;s website once stated: &quot;I strongly believe that everything must be on the table as we seek to reduce carbon emissions.&quot; In late 2010, he co-authored a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opinion piece saying he was &quot;not convinced&quot; that &quot;carbon is a problem in need of regulation&quot; and urging Congress to overturn &quot;Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency.&quot;

Upton and Ed Whitfield co-sponsored H.R. 910, the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011. Due to his environmental policies, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 2011 that Upton &quot;represents one of the biggest threats to planet Earth on planet Earth.&quot;

In 2012, Upton, as chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that Congress&#x27;s refusal to set greenhouse gas limits &quot;constituted a decision and that lawmakers should act now to reverse the EPA emissions rules.&quot; Carbon regulation, he said, &quot;threatens to drive energy prices higher, destroy jobs and hamstring our economic recovery.&quot;

On October 22, 2013, Upton introduced the North American Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3301; 113th Congress), a bill that would make changes to permitting requirements for pipelines and other energy infrastructure at international borders. He said the bill &quot;is a sincere effort to focus a targeted solution to lessons learned from the Keystone Pipeline... No one can rightly argue that the current presidential permit process as the State Department is not broken, no matter what side of the climate debate you&#x27;re on.&quot; Upton added, &quot;we&#x27;re creating a fair and transparent approval process for cross-border energy projects, putting them all on a level playing field for the benefit of North American energy security, lower energy prices, and jobs.&quot;

As of 2017, Upton has received more than $2 million in campaign donations from oil and gas companies and electric utilities over the course of his political career. In 2018, he joined the Climate Solutions Caucus.

====Technology and infrastructure====
Upton introduced legislation to reverse the FCC&#x27;s ruling on net neutrality in 2015. On November 5, 2021, Upton was one of 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

====Guns====
In 2019, Upton supported a bill that requires background checks for private firearm sales. He has called for Congress to pass a bipartisan red flag law.

In March 2021, Upton was one of eight Republicans to join the House majority in passing the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.

====LGBT rights====
In 2004 and 2006, Upton voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In 2019, he voted against the Equality Act, which would extend existing civil rights legislation to protect LGBT individuals from discrimination.

In 2013, Upton condemned controversial anti-gay remarks by Republican National Committeeman David Agema.

In 2021, Upton was one of 29 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This bill expanded legal protections for transgender people, and contained provisions allowing transgender women to use women&#x27;s shelters and serve time in prisons matching their gender identity.

In 2021, Upton was one of 33 Republicans to vote for the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act.

In 2021, Upton co-sponsored the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and protect the free exercise of religion.

On July 19, 2022, Upton and 46 other Republican Representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.

====Economy====

In 2019, during the 116th Congress, Upton broke with his party, one of seven Republicans to side with Democrats by voting for legislation that would fund government services and end a shutdown.

In February 2021, Upton voted against a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill that provided $10 billion in federal aid to Michigan.

==== Donald Trump====
During Trump&#x27;s presidency, Upton voted in line with Trump&#x27;s stated position 78.6% of the time.

In July 2019, Upton was one of four Republican House members to vote in support of a motion to condemn comments Trump made on Twitter calling on four Democratic Congresswomen, three of whom were born in the U.S., to &quot;go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.&quot;

On December 18, 2019, Upton voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump.

On January 12, 2021, Upton announced he would vote to impeach Trump in the pending vote on a second impeachment, claiming Trump incited the January 6 United States Capitol attack, becoming the fourth House Republican to say they would vote to impeach. He ultimately did so alongside nine other Republicans on January 13. On January 21, 2021, the Allegan County Republican Party censured Upton for his vote to impeach Trump. He was later censured by the Cass County Republican Party for voting to remove Marjorie Taylor Greene from the House Education Committee.

On May 19, 2021, Upton was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the Capitol attack. Before the vote, he was one of few Republican lawmakers to openly express support for the commission.

In October 2024, Upton endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, calling Trump &quot;unfit to serve&quot;.

====Iraq====
In June 2021, Upton was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the AUMF against Iraq.
